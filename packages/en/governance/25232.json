During that period\r\nhistorical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of\r\nmaterials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have\r\nbeen thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been\r\ncorrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of\r\nour history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost exclusively\r\nto professed historical students. It is believed that the time has come\r\nwhen the advance which has been made in the knowledge of English history\r\nas a whole should be laid before the public in a single work of fairly\r\nadequate size. Such a book should be founded on independent thought and\r\nresearch, but should at the same time be written with a full knowledge\r\nof the works of the best modern historians and with a desire to take\r\nadvantage of their teaching wherever it appears sound.\r\n\r\nThe vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a\r\nHistory of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing\r\nstate of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly\r\nadvisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an\r\nattempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained\r\nby research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different\r\nwriters, each of them chosen as being specially capable of dealing with\r\nthe period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each\r\nauthor as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity\r\nin method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their\r\ncontents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History.\r\n\r\nAs its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,\r\nwith the History of England and, after the date of the union with\r\nScotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of\r\na nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be\r\nunderstood without taking into account the various forces acting upon\r\nit, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and\r\neconomic progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes\r\nwill, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,\r\nand references will not be appended to statements which appear to be\r\nmatters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume\r\nwill have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,\r\noriginal and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be\r\ncompiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long\r\nlists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That the\r\nHistory will have faults both of its own and such as will always in some\r\nmeasure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains have\r\nbeen spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of the\r\ngreatness of its subject.\r\n\r\nEach volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in\r\nitself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and\r\nwill have its own index, and two or more maps._\r\n\r\n\r\nVol. I. to 1066.

His accession caused\r\ngeneral satisfaction. The jacobite schism had come to an end; no one\r\nimagined that a restoration of the exiled house was possible, or\r\nseriously wished that it might take place. The remembrance of the rising\r\nof '45 strengthened the general feeling of loyalty to the reigning\r\nhouse; the Old Pretender had lost all interest in public affairs, and\r\nhis son, Charles Edward, was a confirmed drunkard, and had alienated his\r\nfriends by his disreputable life. Englishmen were determined not to have\r\nanother Roman catholic king, and they were too proud of their country\r\nwillingly to accept as their king a prince who was virtually a foreigner\r\nas well as a papist, and whose cause had in past years been maintained\r\nby the enemies of England. It is true that their last two kings had been\r\nforeigners, but this was so no longer; their new king had been born and\r\nbrought up among them and was an Englishman to the backbone. He\r\nsucceeded an old king of coarse manners and conversation and of openly\r\nimmoral life, and his youth and the respectability of his morals added\r\nto the pleasure with which his people greeted him as a sovereign of\r\ntheir own nation.\r\n\r\nNational feeling was growing in strength; it had been kindled by Pitt,\r\nand fanned into a flame by a series of victories which were largely due\r\nto the inspiration of his lofty spirit. He had raised Great Britain from\r\na low estate to a height such as it had never reached before. The French\r\npower had been overthrown in North America and the dominion of Canada\r\nhad been added to the British territories. In India the victories of\r\nClive and his generals were soon to be crowned by the fall of\r\nPondicherry, and French and Dutch alike had already lost all chance of\r\nsuccessfully opposing the advance of British rule by force of arms.\r\nGreat Britain had become mistress of the sea. Her naval power secured\r\nher the possession of Canada, for her ships cut off the garrison of\r\nMontreal from help by sea; it sealed the fate of the French operations\r\nin India, for D'Ache was forced to withdraw his ships from the\r\nCoromandel coast and leave Lally without support. In the West Indies\r\nGuadeloupe had fallen, and in Africa Goree. In every quarter the power\r\nof France was destroyed, her colonies were conquered, her ships captured\r\nor driven from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe naval supremacy of England is attested, strange as it seems at first\r\nsight, by her losses in merchant shipping, which were far heavier than\r\nthose of France, more than 300 in 1760, more than 800 in 1761, for many\r\nEnglish merchantmen were at sea while the French dared not send out\r\ntheir merchant ships for fear of capture. Nor was this all, for the ruin\r\nof the commerce of France led the shipowners of St. Malo to fit out many\r\nof their ships as privateers and corsairs, and the ruin of her navy sent\r\nmany a fine seaman aboard them. Skippers of English traders who\r\nstraggled from their convoy, or sailed ahead of it in order to be first\r\nin the market, were often punished for their obstinacy or greediness by\r\nthese fast-sailing privateers.[1] In spite of these losses, England's\r\nsupremacy at sea caused a rapid increase in her wealth and commerce, and\r\nshe took full advantage of her power, seizing French merchandise carried\r\nin neutral vessels. The wealth acquired through her naval supremacy\r\nenabled her to uphold the cause of her allies on the continent.\r\nEngland's purse alone afforded Frederick of Prussia the means of keeping\r\nthe field, and the continuance of the war depended on her subsidies. The\r\ncontinental war, in which our troops played a secondary part, was by no\r\nmeans so popular as the naval war, yet under Pitt's administration it\r\nhad helped to rouse the spirit of the nation. A new militia had been\r\ncreated and the old jealousy of a standing army was weakened. It was,\r\nthen, at a time when national feeling was strong that Englishmen were\r\ncalled upon to welcome a king of their own nationality, and they\r\nanswered to the call with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE YOUNG KING._]\r\n\r\nGeorge was in many respects worthy of their welcome. Moral in his\r\nconduct and domestic in his tastes, he set an example of sobriety and\r\ngeneral decency of behaviour. He was kind-hearted and had the gift of\r\npleasing. On public occasions his demeanour and words were dignified. In\r\nprivate he talked in a homely way, his words following one another too\r\nquickly and sometimes showing a confusion of thought and excitability of\r\nbrain. To the poor he would speak with familiar kindness, chatting with\r\nthem like a good-natured squire. Yet simple as he was in his habits and\r\nprivate talk, he always spoke and acted as a gentleman; the coarseness\r\nof the old court was a thing of the past. He was deeply and unaffectedly\r\npious, and was strongly attached to the Church of England; his religion\r\nwas of a sober kind and was carried into his daily life. He was\r\nconstantly guided by the dictates of his conscience. His will was\r\nstrong; and as his conscience was by no means always so well-informed as\r\nhe believed it to be, his firmness often deserved the name of obstinacy.\r\nNor, in common with the best of men, did he always clearly distinguish\r\nbetween his personal feelings and conscientious convictions. He had\r\ngreat self-control, and was both morally and physically courageous.\r\nThough as a youth he had been idle, he was never addicted to pleasure;\r\nhis accession brought him work which was congenial to him, he overcame\r\nhis natural tendency to sloth and, so long as his health allowed,\r\ndischarged his kingly duties with diligence. His intellectual powers\r\nwere small and uncultivated, but he had plenty of shrewdness and common\r\nsense; he showed a decided ability for kingcraft, not of the highest\r\nkind, and gained many successes over powerful opponents. The welfare of\r\nhis people was dear to him; he was jealous for the honour of England,\r\nrejoiced in her prosperity, and strove with all his strength to save her\r\nfrom humiliation. In religion, tastes, and prejudices he was in sympathy\r\nwith the great mass of his people; and in matters in which his policy\r\nand conduct seem most open to censure, he had the majority of the nation\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, some serious failings which brought trouble both on his\r\npeople and himself. They were largely the results of his training. His\r\nfather, Frederick, Prince of Wales, a fool, a fribble and worse, died\r\nwhen George was twelve years old. His mother, the Princess Augusta, was\r\na woman of strong will, ambitious of power, unamiable in temper,\r\nthoroughly insincere, narrow-minded, and full of petty feelings. She was\r\nstrict in all religious matters, had a high sense of duty, and was a\r\ncareful mother. When her son became king, she acted as though she had a\r\nright to direct him in his political work. Her interference was\r\nmischievous: she was unpopular and incapable of understanding the\r\npolitics of a great country; for she had the prejudices of a little\r\nGerman court, and regarded politics merely in a personal light. George\r\ngrew up completely under her influence. Jealous of her authority and\r\ninfluence over her sons, she was quick to suspect their governors and\r\npreceptors of trying to act independently of her, and thwarted them\r\ncontinually. They had no chance of gaining George's confidence or of\r\ngiving him the benefits which a lad may derive from the society of men\r\nexperienced in the ways of the world. Do what they would, the princess\r\nwas always too strong for them, and Lord Waldegrave, one of the prince's\r\ngovernors, records as his own experience that \"the mother and the\r\nnursery always prevailed\". Nor had George the opportunity of learning\r\nanything from companions of his own age; his mother was afraid that his\r\nmorals would be corrupted by association with young people, and kept him\r\nin the strictest seclusion. He had no friend except his brother Edward.\r\nHer jealousy extended to her children's nearest relations. They had\r\nlittle intercourse with the court, and William, Duke of Cumberland,\r\nwhose upright character and soldierly qualities might well have endeared\r\nhim to his nephews, complained that as children they were taught to\r\nregard him with the most unworthy suspicion.\r\n\r\nBrought up among bed-chamber women and pages, in an unwholesome\r\natmosphere of petty intrigue, and carefully kept from contact with the\r\nworld, George had the failings which such a system might be expected to\r\nproduce. His mother certainly succeeded in implanting in his heart\r\nreligious principles which he preserved through life, and she turned him\r\nout a pure-minded and well-bred young man; but the faults in his\r\ncharacter were confirmed. He was uncharitable in his judgments of others\r\nand harsh in his condemnation of conduct which he did not approve. His\r\nprejudices were strengthened; he put too high a value on his own\r\nopinions and was extremely stubborn. In dealing with men, he thought too\r\nmuch of what was due to himself and too little of what was due to\r\nothers. As a lad he lacked frankness, and in later life was disingenuous\r\nand intriguing. When he was displeased his temper was sullen and\r\nresentful. He was always overcareful about money, and in old age this\r\ntendency developed into parsimony. His education was deficient; it had\r\nnot been carried on steadily, and he had been allowed to indulge a\r\nconstitutional inertness. Though he overcame this habit, the time which\r\nhe had lost could not be made up for, and ideas which might have been\r\ncorrected or enlarged by a more thorough education, remained firmly\r\nfixed in his mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE EARL OF BUTE._]\r\n\r\nAmong these ideas were an exaggerated conception of the royal\r\nprerogative and the belief that it was his duty as king to govern as\r\nwell as to reign. His mother's constant exhortation to him, \"George, be\r\na king,\" fell upon willing ears, and appears to have been enforced by\r\nhis tutors. A more powerful influence on the mind of the young prince\r\nthan that of any of his tutors was exercised by John Stuart, Earl of\r\nBute, his mother's chief friend and adviser. He was a fine showy man,\r\nvain of his handsome person, theatrical in his manners, pompous, slow\r\nand sententious in his speech. His private life was respectable; he had\r\nliterary and scientific tastes, and a good deal of superficial\r\nknowledge. His abilities were small; he would, George's father used to\r\nsay, \"make an excellent ambassador in any court where there was nothing\r\nto do\".[2] He lacked the steadfast self-reliance necessary to the part\r\nwhich he undertook to play, and had none of the dogged resolution of his\r\nroyal pupil. His enemies freely accused him of falsehood; he was\r\ncertainly addicted to intrigue, but he was probably too proud a man to\r\nutter direct lies. The friendship between him and the princess was close\r\nand lasting. It was generally believed that he was her paramour, but for\r\nthis there is no real evidence. It would have been contrary to the\r\ncharacter of the princess, and the assertion seems to have been a\r\nmalicious scandal. George liked him, and when he was provided with a\r\nhousehold of his own in 1756, he persuaded the king to put the earl at\r\nthe head of it as his groom of the stole. Though utterly incompetent for\r\nthe task, Bute instructed the prince in the duties of kingship; he\r\nencouraged him in the idea that a king should exercise a direct control\r\nover public affairs, and is said to have borrowed for him a portion of\r\nBlackstone's then unpublished _Commentaries on the Laws of England_ in\r\nwhich the royal authority is magnified.\r\n\r\nGeorge's political system was, it is evident, largely based on\r\nBolingbroke's essay _On the Idea of a Patriot King_. In this essay\r\nBolingbroke lays down that a king who desires the welfare of his people\r\nshould \"begin to govern as soon as he begins to reign,\" that he must\r\nchoose as his ministers men who \"will serve on the same principles on\r\nwhich he intends to govern,\" and that he must avoid governing by a\r\nparty. Such a king will unite his people, and put himself at their head,\r\n\"in order to govern, or more properly subdue, all parties\". This\r\ndoctrine seemed specially appropriate to the state of affairs at\r\nGeorge's accession. During the last two reigns the power of the crown\r\nhad dwindled. Neither George I. nor George II. had cared for, or indeed\r\nunderstood, domestic politics, and the government had fallen into the\r\nhands of the whig party which became dominant at the Revolution. The\r\nwhigs posed as defenders of the Hanoverian house and of the principles\r\nof 1688. Those principles limited the exercise of the prerogative, but\r\nthey did not involve depriving the crown of all participation in the\r\ngovernment. The whig party exaggerated them, and while the fortunes of\r\nHanover and continental affairs absorbed the attention of the king, they\r\ncompletely usurped the government of the country. They were strong in\r\nthe house of lords, and secured their position in the commons by\r\nemploying the patronage of the crown, the money of the nation, and their\r\nown wealth and influence to control the borough elections. For nearly\r\nfifty years a small number of whig lords shared the government of the\r\ncountry among themselves. During Walpole's administration the whigs\r\nbecame split into sections. Several of the more powerful lords of the\r\nparty had each his own following or \"connexion\" in parliament, composed\r\nof men bound to him by family ties, interest, or the gift of a seat.\r\nThese sections, while they agreed in keeping the crown out of all part\r\nin the government, and the tories out of all share in the good things\r\nwhich the crown had to bestow, struggled with one another for office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING INTENDS TO RULE._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tories were left out in the cold. So long as jacobitism\r\nwas a danger to the state, this was not a fair cause of complaint, for\r\nmany tories had corresponded with the exiled princes. By 1760, however,\r\ntories had become as loyal as whigs. George was fully determined to put\r\nan end to this state of things: he would be master in his own kingdom;\r\nhe and not the whigs should govern England. He naturally rejoiced to see\r\nthe tories, a large and important body of his subjects, reconciled to\r\nthe throne; and as he had been brought up in tory principles, he\r\nwelcomed with peculiar pleasure the support of the party of prerogative.\r\nThe tories were no longer to be neglected by the crown; the whig\r\nmonopoly was to be brought to an end. He did not contemplate taking\r\npolitical power from one party in order to vest it in another. He\r\ndesigned to rule independently of party; no political section was\r\nnecessarily to be excluded from office, but no body of men, whether\r\nunited by common principles or common interest, was henceforth to\r\ndictate to the crown. To be willing and able to carry on the government\r\nin accordance with his will was to be the sole qualification for a share\r\nin the administration. Ministers might or might not be agreed on matters\r\nof the first importance; all the agreement between them which was\r\nnecessary was that each in his own sphere should act as an agent of the\r\nking's policy.\r\n\r\nThe system was not so impossible as it would be at present. The idea of\r\nthe cabinet as a homogeneous body, collectively responsible to\r\nparliament, was not yet established. Government was largely carried on\r\nby ministers working more or less independently of one another. In 1760\r\nthe cabinet, an informal committee of the privy council, was an\r\ninstitution of a different character from that of to-day. During the\r\nlast two reigns it had included, along with the ministers holding the\r\nchief political offices, whether of business or dignity, certain great\r\ncourt officials, and some other personages of conspicuous position whose\r\nassistance might be useful to the government. Nominally the \"lords of\r\nthe cabinet\" were fairly numerous. They did not all take an equal share\r\nin government. The king's \"most serious affairs\" were directed by not\r\nmore than five or six of them, who formed a kind of inner cabinet, the\r\nfirst lord of the treasury, the two secretaries of state, one or more of\r\nthe principal supporters of the administration, and generally the lord\r\nchancellor. They discussed matters privately, sometimes settling what\r\nshould be laid before a cabinet meeting, and sometimes communicating\r\ntheir decisions to the king as the advice of his ministers, without\r\nsubmitting them to the cabinet at large.[3] Outside this small inner\r\ncircle the lords of the cabinet held a position rather of dignity than\r\nof power, and some of them rarely attended a cabinet meeting.[4] This\r\narrangement was mainly due to the long predominance of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole and to the overwhelming political influence of a few great whig\r\nhouses. The strife among the whigs which followed Walpole's retirement\r\nand the critical character of foreign affairs tended to increase the\r\nnumber of councillors who commonly took part in cabinet business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CABINET._]\r\n\r\nThe first cabinet of George III. as settled with reference to a meeting\r\nheld on November 17, consisted of the keeper of the great seal (Lord\r\nHenley), the president of the council (Lord Granville), the two\r\nsecretaries of state (Pitt and Holdernesse), the Duke of Newcastle\r\n(first lord of the treasury), Lord Hardwicke (ex-chancellor), Lord Anson\r\n(first lord of the admiralty), Lord Ligonier (master-general of the\r\nordnance), Lord Mansfield (lord chief-justice), the Duke of Bedford\r\n(lord-lieutenant of Ireland) and the Duke of Devonshire (lord\r\nchamberlain). If Lord Halifax (president of the board of trade) pleased,\r\nhe might attend to give information on American affairs; and Newcastle\r\nsuggested that Legge (the chancellor of the exchequer, whose office, as\r\nfinance was then largely managed by the first lord of the treasury, was\r\nof less importance than it soon became) and the \"solicitor\" (Charles\r\nYorke, solicitor-general) should also be summoned.[5] Soon afterwards\r\nBute was appointed groom of the stole to the king and entered the\r\ncabinet.[6] After 1760 the cabinet began to assume its later form;\r\nquestions of the highest importance were debated and decided on in\r\nmeetings of eleven or twelve councillors, and in 1761 Hardwicke\r\ncomplained that the king's \"most serious affairs\" were discussed by as\r\nmany as would in earlier days have formed a whole cabinet.[7] From 1765\r\nthe existence of an inner circle becomes less distinct, though at all\r\ntimes a prime minister naturally takes counsel privately with the most\r\nprominent or most trusted members of his government. Non-efficient\r\nmembers of a cabinet appear more rarely until, in 1783, they disappear\r\naltogether. The old inner cabinet becomes expanded into a council\r\nconsisting generally of high political officers, and the members, ten or\r\ntwelve in number, discuss and settle the weightiest affairs of state.\r\nWith the critical negotiations with France in 1796 came a new\r\ndevelopment; the prime minister, the younger Pitt, and Lord Grenville,\r\nthe foreign secretary, arranged that the British ambassador should write\r\nprivate despatches for their information, and others of a less\r\nconfidential character which might be read by the cabinet at large.[8]\r\nHere a new inner cabinet is foreshadowed. It differed from the old one:\r\nthat arose from the small number who were entrusted with an actual share\r\nin the government; this, from the fact that the number of the king's\r\nconfidential servants was so large that it was advisable that certain\r\nmatters of special secrecy should only be made known to and discussed by\r\ntwo or three. The subsequent increase of the council promoted the\r\ndevelopment of an inner cabinet, and such a body is understood to have\r\nexisted for many years during which cabinets have been of a size\r\nundreamt of by ministers of George III.\r\n\r\nThe solidarity of the cabinet is now secured by the peculiar functions\r\nand powers of a prime minister.[9] It was not so at the accession of\r\nGeorge III. That there should be an avowed prime minister possessing the\r\nchief weight in the council and the principal place in the confidence of\r\nthe king is a doctrine which was not established until the first\r\nadministration of the younger Pitt; and though the title of prime\r\nminister had come into use by 1760, it was still regarded as invidious\r\nby constitutional purists. According to George's system he was himself\r\nto be the only element of coherence in a ministry; it was to be formed\r\nby the prime minister in accordance with his instructions, and each\r\nmember of it was to be guided by his will. The factious spirit of the\r\nwhigs, the extent to which they monopolised power, and the humiliating\r\nposition to which they had reduced the crown, afford a measure of\r\ndefence for his scheme of government. Yet it was in itself\r\nunconstitutional, for it would have made the ministers who were\r\nresponsible to parliament mere agents of the king who was not personally\r\nresponsible for his public acts. And it was not, nor indeed could it be,\r\ncarried out except by adopting means which were unconstitutional and\r\ndisastrous. It necessarily made the king the head of a party. He needed\r\nvotes in parliament, and he obtained them, as the whig leaders had done,\r\nby discreditable means. If his ministers did not please him he sought\r\nsupport from the members of his party, \"the king's friends,\" as they\r\nwere called; and so there arose an influence behind the throne distinct\r\nfrom and often opposed to that of his responsible advisers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S SCHEME._]\r\n\r\nSince 1757 the strife of the whig factions had been stilled by\r\ncoalition. At the king's accession the administration was strong. It\r\nowed its strength to the co-operation of the Duke of Newcastle, the\r\nfirst lord of the treasury, and Pitt, secretary of state.[10] Newcastle,\r\nthe most prominent figure among the great whig nobles, derived his power\r\nfrom influence; he had an unrivalled experience in party management and\r\nas a dispenser of patronage, and though personally above accepting a\r\nbribe of any kind, he was an adept at corrupt practices. He would have\r\nbeen incapable of conducting the war, for he was ignorant, timid, and\r\nvacillating, but he knew how to gain the support of parliament and how\r\nto find the supplies which the war demanded. Pitt was strong in the\r\npopular favour which he had gained by his management of the war; he was\r\nsupremely fitted to guide the country in time of war, but he was too\r\nhaughty and imperious to be successful in the management of a party. He\r\ndid not care to concern himself about applications for bishoprics,\r\nexcisorships, titles, and pensions, or the purchase of seats in\r\nparliament. All such work was done by Newcastle. For his attack on the\r\nwhig party George needed a scheme and a man--some one to act for him in\r\nmatters in which as king he could not appear personally to interfere.\r\nThe man was ready to his hand, his friend and teacher, Bute. His scheme\r\nof attack was to create a division between Newcastle and Pitt, to make\r\npeace with France, and force Pitt to leave the ministry, Pitt's\r\nresignation would weaken the whigs, and the king would be in a position\r\nto give office to Bute and any other ministers he might choose.\r\nNewcastle and Pitt were not really in accord, for not only was Newcastle\r\njealous of Pitt, but he was anxious to bring the war to an end while\r\nPitt wished to continue it. George therefore started on his work of\r\nsowing dissension between them with something in his favour. He disliked\r\nPitt's war policy. He and Bute desired peace, no doubt for its own sake,\r\nas well as because it would forward their plan, for when the war ended\r\nthe great war minister would no longer be necessary to the whigs.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his accession George privately offered to make Bute a\r\nsecretary of state.[11] He refused the offer, for to have stepped into\r\nthe place of Holdernesse while the whig party was still united would\r\nhave been premature. The council was immediately summoned to Carlton\r\nhouse, a residence of the princess-dowager. George at once showed that\r\nhe would take a line of his own. After a few gracious words to Newcastle\r\nin private audience, he closed the interview by saying, \"My lord Bute is\r\nyour very good friend and will tell you my thoughts at large\". The duke,\r\nPitt, and Holdernesse were called into the closet to hear the\r\ndeclaration he was about to make to the privy council; it is said to\r\nhave been written by the king himself with the help of Bute. When it had\r\nbeen read George merely asked if anything was \"wrong in point of form\".\r\nPitt could scarcely believe his ears; the war was described as \"bloody\r\nand expensive\". He had an interview with Bute in the evening and\r\ninsisted on a change in the sentence. He carried his point, and the\r\nwords in the council-book with reference to the war are: \"As I mount the\r\nthrone in the midst of an expensive, but just and necessary war, I shall\r\nendeavour to prosecute it in a manner most likely to bring about an\r\nhonourable and lasting peace in concert with my allies\". The last five\r\nwords were dictated by Pitt.[12] Bute having been sworn of the privy\r\ncouncil, and having entered the cabinet as groom of the stole, assumed\r\n\"a magisterial air of authority,\" and was universally recognised as the\r\nking's confidant and mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nThe king opened parliament on November 19, wearing his crown. His speech\r\nwas settled by his ministers, and was sent to Bute for his perusal,\r\nNewcastle intending himself to lay it before the king, as it was his\r\nright to do.[13] Bute, however, took it to the king, and Newcastle to\r\nhis amazement received it back from the earl with an additional clause\r\nwritten by the king's hand, and a message that the king would have it\r\ninserted in the speech which was to be laid before him next day in\r\ncabinet council.[14] The clause began: \"Born and educated in this\r\ncountry, I glory in the name of Britain\" [_sic_], and went on to express\r\nthe king's confidence in the loyalty of his people and his desire to\r\npromote their welfare.[15] The words were unexceptionable, but the\r\nabsolute command to insert them in the speech for which the ministers,\r\nnot the king, were responsible, was unwise. The use of the word Britain\r\nwas attributed to the Scotsman Bute. In later life the king declared\r\nthat he had written the clause without suggestion from any one.[16] His\r\ncommand was obeyed, and the manner in which his words were received\r\nillustrates the adulation then customarily rendered to the sovereign.\r\nHardwicke, who was in the habit of composing addresses for his\r\ncolleagues, seems to have taken \"Britain\" for \"Briton,\" as indeed it\r\nusually appears in print, and inserted a clause in the lords' address\r\nending with--\"What a lustre does it cast on the name of Briton when you,\r\nSir, are pleased to esteem it among your glories!\" When whig lords could\r\nadopt such words as these, a young king might well be encouraged to\r\nthink over-highly of the royal prerogative. The incident has a special\r\ninterest. The cabinet council of the 17th, in which the speech was read\r\nin its final form, was held by the king in person. By the end of the\r\nlast reign it had become unusual that the king should preside at cabinet\r\nmeetings. With one doubtful exception, George III. never again presided\r\nat a meeting, and so the absence of the sovereign from the deliberations\r\nof the cabinet became an established constitutional usage. Thus at the\r\ntime when the king was preparing to assume a preponderance in the\r\ngovernment, the crown finally abandoned one of the few remaining customs\r\nwhich indicated a right to govern as well as to reign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CIVIL LIST._]\r\n\r\nA like contrast is afforded by the arrangement of the civil list. George\r\nwas the first sovereign who entirely surrendered his interest in the\r\nhereditary revenues of the crown in England, and placed them at the\r\ndisposal of parliament. In return parliament voted him a civil list, or\r\nfixed revenue, \"for the support of his household and the dignity of the\r\ncrown\". The sum voted was L800,000 a year, which was at first charged\r\nwith some pensions to members of the royal family. By this arrangement\r\nthe control of parliament over the king's expenditure was asserted at a\r\ntime when the king was relying on his prerogative to enable him to\r\nbecome independent of ministerial control. Besides this income George\r\nhad the hereditary revenues from Scotland, a civil list in Ireland, the\r\nduchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, and certain admiralty and other dues,\r\nthe whole amounting to \"certainly not much short of a million\r\nannually\".[17] If the value of money at the time is considered, it may\r\nbe allowed that the crown was amply provided for, and that so thrifty a\r\nking as George would always have found his revenues sufficient for his\r\nneeds, if he had not spent large sums in supplying pensions and places\r\nof profit for his political adherents, and in other methods of\r\ncorruption. The good impression made by the young king was heightened by\r\na speech from the throne on March 3, 1761, recommending that in order to\r\ncomplete the independence of judges, their commission should not for the\r\nfuture be terminated by the demise of the crown, and that sufficient\r\nsalaries should be assigned to them. An act to that effect was\r\naccordingly passed. On the 19th the king closed the session, and\r\nparliament was dissolved shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe war was going on gloriously under Pitt's direction. Our ally,\r\nFrederick of Prussia, was, indeed, in distress in spite of his\r\nhard-earned victory at Torgau, for his resources were exhausted, and\r\nhalf his dominions were occupied by his enemies. During 1761 Prince\r\nHenry made no progress in Saxony. Frederick himself lost Schweidnitz,\r\nand, with it, half Silesia, while the fall of Colberg left the Russians\r\nfree either to besiege Stettin in the following spring, or to seize on\r\nBrandenburg. In Western Germany, however, where a British army was\r\nserving under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the defence of Hanover\r\nagainst the French, a signal success was gained. Early in the year the\r\nallies entered Hesse, and forced the French to retreat almost to the\r\nMain. Nevertheless they failed to take Cassel, the chief object of the\r\ncampaign, and were obliged to retire from Hesse. In June two French\r\narmies, under Marshal de Broglie and Prince Soubise, effected a junction\r\nat Paderborn, advanced to Soest, and threatened Lippstadt. Ferdinand\r\ntook up a position between the Lippe and the Ahse at Vellinghausen. On\r\nJuly 15 he was attacked by the French. The enemy engaged his left wing,\r\nformed by the British troops under their commander, the gallant Marquis\r\nof Granby. The attack was splendidly met and finally repulsed. The\r\nbattle was renewed the next morning at daybreak, and the allies gained a\r\ncomplete victory. The British troops, who formed about a fourth part of\r\nthe allied army, highly distinguished themselves; Maxwell's grenadiers\r\nalone captured four French battalions. This victory, won against heavy\r\nodds, foiled the most serious attempt of the French against Hanover; it\r\nsaved Lippstadt, which would have been exceedingly useful to them as a\r\ndepot; and, more than that, it caused a quarrel between Broglie and\r\nSoubise, which ended in the recall of Broglie, by far the abler of the\r\ntwo generals. Meanwhile they parted company; Soubise did much mischief\r\nin Westphalia, and Broglie campaigned to the east of the Weser. The\r\nFrench kept their hold on Gottingen and Cassel, and were therefore in a\r\nposition to renew their attacks on Hanover the following year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAPTURE OF BELLE ILE._]\r\n\r\nNews came from India of the fall of Pondicherry on January 15, 1761, and\r\nthis was the end of the French power in that land. Few were the French\r\nships which put out to sea during the year, and they were all taken. In\r\nthe West Indies Dominica, one of the so-called neutral islands, of which\r\nthe French had taken possession, was reduced by Lord Rollo, then holding\r\na command in New York. About the same time the French received a more\r\ngalling blow. On March 29 a fleet under the command of Keppel, carrying\r\na land force of about 9,000 men under General Hodgson, sailed for Belle\r\nIle, a small and barren island with a population of 5,000, mostly\r\nfisher-folk. It was fortified and well garrisoned. A first attempt to\r\nland was repulsed with nearly 500 casualties. Tidings of the repulse\r\nwere brought to Pitt; he sent reinforcements and ordered the commander\r\nto persevere. A second attempt, carried out with remarkable daring, was\r\nsuccessful, and siege was laid to Palais, the strong place of the\r\nisland. It was gallantly defended by the governor, who in a night attack\r\nsurprised the British in their trenches and inflicted a heavy loss upon\r\nthem. The lines which covered the town were taken by storm and the place\r\nwas abandoned, but the fortress still held out. As, however, the British\r\nships cut off all supplies, the garrison was at last, on June 7, forced\r\nto capitulate. They marched out with the honours of war and were\r\nconveyed to the mainland. By the capture of Belle Ile England gained far\r\nmore than the barren island; it was French soil, and France would be\r\nprepared to surrender possessions of greater value in exchange for it.\r\nFor Pitt the success of the expedition was a special triumph, for he had\r\ninsisted upon it in spite of the opposition of Newcastle and the adverse\r\nopinion of the admirals Hawke and Boscawen.\r\n\r\nWhile Pitt was laying down and carrying out plans of victory, the king\r\nand Bute were exciting discord between him and Newcastle. For a few days\r\nafter the accession Newcastle seemed more in favour than Pitt, who was\r\njustly displeased because Lord George Sackville, one of Bute's friends,\r\nwas received at court in spite of his recent disgrace. Before long,\r\nhowever, Newcastle found himself slighted and became violently jealous\r\nof Pitt. If Bute were to ally himself with Pitt and adopt his policy,\r\nthe old minister knew that his own day would soon be over. He received a\r\nhint that a change was contemplated. At the end of six months, Bute\r\nsaid, the king \"will declare whom he will call to his cabinet\r\ncouncil\".[18] The alliance between Pitt and Bute seemed complete. In\r\nJanuary, 1761, the Spanish ambassador wrote: \"there is no better voice\r\nin council than his [Pitt's], which joined to that of my Lord Bute seems\r\nto decide matters\".[19] Pitt could work well with the rising star so\r\nlong as Bute did not oppose the continuance of the war, for he heartily\r\napproved of breaking down party distinctions, and, like the king, hated\r\ngovernment by connexion. While, however, the king desired to destroy\r\nfactions in order to establish personal government, Pitt desired that\r\nthey should give place to a system of government by the best men,\r\nsupported by the king and the nation. Tories were graciously received at\r\ncourt, and among them many of Bute's fellow-countrymen. In November,\r\n1760, six tory lords and grooms of the bed-chamber were appointed\r\nwithout any intimation having been given to Newcastle.[20] The whigs\r\nwere amazed, and the duke's mortification was keen.\r\n\r\nThe king's determination to break down the system which had so long\r\nsecured the whig power was set forth and commended in a remarkable\r\npamphlet written by Douglas, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, and\r\nprobably inspired by his patron, Lord Bath.[21] It urged the king to be\r\non his guard against \"the pretensions of a confederacy of ministers,\"\r\nand to exercise the full extent of power allowed him by the\r\nconstitution. He must not let his patronage go by the advice of\r\nministers. Let him rely on his people; let him be master. Proscription,\r\nthe writer says, is ended, and he expresses his belief that if the king\r\nwill pursue the line marked out in his pamphlet, corruption also will\r\ndisappear; for so long as a minister disposes of places, he has the\r\nmeans of corrupting parliament, whereas if the crown dispenses its own\r\npatronage it will gain strength, and the independence of parliament will\r\nbe restored. For Newcastle, the veteran dispenser of the royal\r\npatronage, such a system meant political extinction. Its meaning was\r\nalready brought home to him by an intimation that he was not to have\r\n\"the choice of parliament,\" the management of the coming general\r\nelection in boroughs under government influence, nor to purchase seats\r\nwith the treasury money. Anson was reproved by Bute for having,\r\naccording to custom, provided members for the admiralty boroughs.\r\nNewcastle believed, with good reason, that Pitt and Bute were agreed on\r\nthis matter. He was deeply distressed, and told his friend Hardwicke\r\nthat he thought he must resign office.[22] That, however, was the last\r\nthing he was likely to do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPPOSING VIEWS WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR._]\r\n\r\nWhile Pitt may have welcomed the co-operation of his new ally from a\r\nbelief that they had a common policy as regards government by connexion,\r\nand as a means of checking the opposition with which his plans were\r\noften received by Newcastle and his friends, it is certain from later\r\nevents that the king and Bute were not sincere in their dealings with\r\nhim. They designed to raise dissension between him and his\r\nfellow-ministers, and so prepare a way for Bute's assumption of office\r\nand for the termination of the war. As early as January 18, 1761, when\r\nNewcastle was sufficiently frightened and humbled, the Sardinian\r\nminister, Count de Viri, one of Bute's tools, had a secret interview\r\nwith him, and proposed that the earl should be made a secretary of\r\nstate. Newcastle, who was mortally afraid of Pitt, said that the\r\nappointment must be made with his concurrence, for otherwise Pitt might\r\nblame him, and might perhaps resign office and leave him and Bute\r\nsaddled with the conduct of the war.[23]\r\n\r\nBute intended when in office to make a peace which would immortalise his\r\nname. He saw that this would soonest be obtained if England withdrew\r\nfrom the war on the continent and confined her operations to the sea.\r\nFrance would then be induced by the loss of her colonies to make a\r\nseparate peace. Pitt was determined not to assent to any peace which was\r\nnot made in concert with our allies and did not insure England a full\r\nreturn for her victories. Bute would have had the country stand apart\r\nfrom continental politics; Pitt desired that it should have continental\r\nallies and make itself felt in the politics of Europe. The two opposing\r\nviews are characteristic of the two men. Pitt maintained that the\r\ncontinental war was profitable because it had hindered France from\r\nputting forth her full strength in defence of her colonies.\r\nStatesmanlike as his position was, there was much to be said on the side\r\nof the tories and others, who held that England should confine herself\r\nto a naval war. We have, they argued, no interest in a war for Silesia.\r\nWhy should we pay Frederick L670,000 a year, the amount of the subsidy\r\nagain granted to him soon after the accession, for fighting in his own\r\nquarrel? What profit do we derive from the L340,000 paid to the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse for the hire of troops? The naval war has brought a\r\nrich return; on the continent we have nothing to gain by victory. As for\r\nthe argument that the German war is one of diversion, why should we\r\ndivert a war from the sea, where we are supreme, to land, where we must\r\nnecessarily be inferior to France? To fight in Germany for Hanover is to\r\nsurrender the advantages of an insular position. Better let France\r\noverrun Hanover, for, as we shall possess her colonies, we can force her\r\nto surrender it again.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are ably stated in a pamphlet entitled _Considerations\r\non the German War_, written by one Israel Mauduit, and published at the\r\nend of 1760. It had a strong effect on public opinion, and was followed\r\nby other pamphlets more or less on the same lines, and probably written\r\nat the instigation of Bute, for he employed and largely rewarded the\r\nservices of pamphleteers. Their arguments were enforced by the growing\r\nexpenses of the war and the difficulty of obtaining men for the army.\r\nThe supplies granted for the year 1760 were L15,503,563; for 1761 they\r\namounted to L19,616,119, the interest on which was to be paid by the\r\ncontinuance of the old taxes and a new tax of three shillings per barrel\r\non beer and ale. The national debt of Great Britain and Ireland, which\r\nin 1755 was L72,505,572, entailing a charge for interest and expenses of\r\na little over L2,500,000, amounted in 1760 to L102,000,000, with a\r\ncharge of L3,500,000.[24] In 1761 the British troops serving abroad were\r\nthirty-nine regiments of foot and thirty-one of horse and dragoons; in\r\nall, 110,000 men, besides 60,000 German auxiliaries in British pay. In\r\nGermany we had about 25,000 men. At the same time sea-pay was drawn for\r\n288 ships of various kinds and 80,675 men, the navy then consisting of\r\n378 vessels, of which 285 were first to sixth rates.[25] Of these, 121\r\nships of the line with about 70,000 men were in active service. The call\r\nfor men was very heavy in proportion to the population, and high\r\nbounties were offered for enlistment. Balloting for the new militia\r\ncaused some riots in the north, specially at Hexham, where the miners\r\nfiercely attacked the militia, and forty-two men were killed and\r\nforty-eight wounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A GENERAL ELECTION._]\r\n\r\nBefore the king and Bute opened their campaign they insured support in\r\nparliament. Early in 1761 preparations were made for the general\r\nelection. The court spread the idea that it was for purity of election;\r\nit was known that Newcastle's hands were tied, and it was expected that\r\nno money would be issued from the treasury. Nothing was less true.\r\nCorruption was rampant and the treasury issued large sums. George\r\npersonally named candidates for boroughs belonging to the crown, to\r\nwhich the ministry had hitherto appointed, and otherwise took an active\r\nshare in the arrangements. For the most part he worked through Bute, to\r\nwhom Newcastle was forced to submit his lists of candidates that he\r\nmight compare them with his own and decide who should be brought in.\r\nThis was galling to the old minister, but he had already done much to\r\nforward the whig interest in the coming election, and flattered himself\r\nthat \"they [the court] had left matters too late for them to do any\r\nmischief\".[26] In former elections the whigs used the resources of the\r\ncrown to secure power for themselves; in this election the crown itself\r\nused its own means of corrupt influence. Private men followed its\r\nexample. A new class of candidates appeared, men without party connexion\r\nor local interest, who had lately become rich, West India merchants,\r\n\"nabobs\" gorged with the spoils of the East, shareholders of the East\r\nIndia Company, admirals and others who had reaped a splendid harvest\r\nfrom the destruction of the commerce and shipping of France. The\r\ncompetition for seats was extraordinary; at Andover there were nine\r\ncandidates. Constituencies which had long obeyed the orders of great\r\nlandlords were no longer to be reckoned upon. No political question was\r\nexciting public interest, and the borough elections were decided rather\r\nby money than by measures. Bribery was carried to a preposterous height,\r\nand the new-rich bought seats as openly as they bought their horses. The\r\nborough of Sudbury went so far as to advertise itself for sale. Those\r\nwho without political aims or connexions forced themselves into\r\nparliament by their wealth were peculiarly open to court influence.\r\nNewcastle's belief that the elections would secure his position was\r\nill-founded; many members on whom he relied were ready to desert him at\r\nthe bidding of the court. By the beginning of March, before the\r\nelections were over, the king and Bute were sure of the support they\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nBute was in a position which enabled him to take office and to begin to\r\ncarry out the designs cherished by his master and himself, to bring the\r\nwar to an end and to encourage the jealousy of Pitt's colleagues to such\r\nan extent that they would force him to leave them. He could be dispensed\r\nwith as soon as peace was made, and without him the whig ranks could\r\neasily be broken up, for Newcastle could be crushed at any time. With\r\nBute as an ally Pitt dominated over his fellow-ministers, who bore his\r\nyoke with rebellious feelings. If Bute came over to their side they\r\ncould make a stand against him. Viri's secret negotiations on Bute's\r\nbehalf gave them a chance not to be neglected. Newcastle, Hardwicke, and\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire took counsel together, and Newcastle went to the\r\nking with a proposal that Bute should accept office. To this George, of\r\ncourse, readily assented. Pitt knew nothing of all this until the matter\r\nwas settled.[27] On March 12 Holdernesse was dismissed. It was not a\r\ncreditable business; four months before he had signified his readiness\r\nto make room for Bute,[28] and he received a present pension of L4,000 a\r\nyear and the reversion of the wardenship of the Cinque Ports, which was\r\nat least equally valuable, as a reward for his complaisance. He was\r\nsucceeded by Bute as secretary of state on the 25th.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Legge, the chancellor of the exchequer, who had refused\r\nto accede to Bute's wishes with regard to two elections, and was much\r\ndisliked by the king,[29] was dismissed, and was succeeded by Lord\r\nBarrington, an honest man, with no strong political convictions, who was\r\nalways ready to carry out the king's plans. Barrington was succeeded as\r\nsecretary-at-war by Charles Townshend, a brilliant wit and orator, \"the\r\ndelight and ornament\" of the house of commons,[30] a reckless and\r\nunstable politician, who was destined to bring evil on his country. A\r\nmonth earlier, one of Bute's adherents, George Grenville, the treasurer\r\nof the navy, a brother of Earl Temple, lord privy seal, and a\r\nbrother-in-law of Pitt, was rewarded by a seat in the cabinet. He had\r\nconsiderable ability, great aptitude for business, and a thorough\r\nknowledge of parliamentary affairs, was a statesman of unsullied purity,\r\npublic-spirited, hard-working and ambitious;[31] he was deficient in\r\ntact, had no generosity of mind, and was harsh, formal, and impatient of\r\nopposition. Newcastle's perfidy increased the ill-feeling between him\r\nand Pitt, against whom the new alliance was avowedly directed,[32] for\r\nat the time that Newcastle sold himself to Bute in order to gain his\r\nsupport, Pitt was becoming aware that the king was probably about to\r\noppose his policy with respect to the war. Newcastle was delighted with\r\nthe success of his trick, but he soon found that Bute slighted him, and\r\nthat his power was going from him, for he was no longer allowed to\r\ncontrol the patronage of the crown.[33] By treating him in this way the\r\nking and Bute kept him subservient. Bute aggravated the division between\r\nthe ministers, and used Pitt's colleagues against him in the conflict\r\nwhich was impending on the question of peace and war. The history of\r\nthat conflict is for convenience' sake deferred to the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S MARRIAGE._]\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction caused by the young king's gracious manners and\r\nrespectable life was increased by his marriage. In 1755 his grandfather\r\nhad proposed that he should marry a princess of the house of Brunswick,\r\nbut abandoned the project in consequence of the opposition of George's\r\nmother. About a year before his accession George fell in love with Lady\r\nSarah Lennox, a daughter of the late Duke of Richmond and sister-in-law\r\nof Henry Fox, a young lady of remarkable beauty. His attentions to her\r\nwere continued after his accession. Fox and his wife, Lady Caroline,\r\ntook care that he should have every opportunity of seeing her; and\r\nGeorge, as he rode through Kensington, was charmed to find her in a\r\nfancy dress playing at hay-making in front of Fox's residence, Holland\r\nHouse. He went so far as to signify plainly to her that he meant to make\r\nher a formal offer of marriage.[34] Most inopportunely Lady Sarah broke\r\nher leg, and while she was laid up, the princess-dowager and Bute\r\npersuaded George to change his mind. They at once arranged a marriage\r\nfor him with the Princess Charlotte, a daughter of the Duke of\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz, and the marriage took place on September 8. The\r\nqueen did not meddle in affairs of state; she bore fifteen children, and\r\nhad many domestic virtues. On the 22nd the king and queen were crowned.\r\n\r\nGeorge's popularity was impaired by the influence exercised over him by\r\nhis mother and Bute, which excited the ridicule of the higher class of\r\nsociety and the bitter feelings of the London populace. Bystanders\r\nsneered when they saw him on his way to visit his mother, and it is said\r\nthat on one occasion he was insulted with a coarse jest. In Bute's case\r\nthe idea that he was the royal favourite would alone have sufficed to\r\nmake him hated. The term was generally applied to him. Yet he was not a\r\nfavourite in the more odious sense of the word, for though the king\r\nshowed him signal favour, their relations were rather political than\r\npersonal. His nationality strengthened the dislike with which he was\r\nregarded. The jacobite troubles had increased the prejudices of the\r\nEnglish against the Scots; they looked down upon them as a\r\nhalf-barbarous people, poor, and greedy to enrich themselves with the\r\nwealth of England. Scorn and indignation were aroused by the grants of\r\nhonours and employments made to Bute's Scottish followers who came in\r\ngreat numbers to the court under his patronage. Bills were posted in\r\nLondon with the words: \"No petticoat government! No Scotch minister! No\r\nLord George Sackville!\" Any unpopular measure was set down to Bute's\r\nadvice. The beer-tax was believed to have been suggested by him, and\r\nprovoked a disturbance in the theatre in the king's presence, which\r\ncaused Bute much annoyance. He was yet to rise higher in the state, and\r\nto arouse more violent feelings of hatred and contempt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mahan, _The Influence of Sea Power upon History_, pp. 318-19.\r\n\r\n[2] Earl Waldegrave's _Memoirs_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[3] See, for example, \"Memorandum of what past at Sir R.

England and Prussia assented, and plenipotentiaries\r\nwere appointed. In England the prospect of a peace was hailed with\r\nsatisfaction, and the funds rose 4 per cent. The congress never met, but\r\nthe plan was not abandoned for some months; and Choiseul, the minister\r\nof Louis XV., sent a memorial to England proposing that, as difficulties\r\nwould arise at the congress if the questions in dispute between England\r\nand France were debated along with the affairs of their respective\r\nallies, the two courts should enter on a separate negotiation. He\r\noffered to treat on the basis of _uti possidetis_, that is, that the\r\npossessions of both countries should be acknowledged as regards the\r\nconquests made by the one from the other, and that certain dates in the\r\ncurrent year should be fixed upon as those on which the conquests should\r\nbe ascertained. The offer was large; for at that time England had\r\nconquered from France Cape Breton, Canada, Guadeloupe, Mariegalante,\r\nGoree, and Senegal, and had also gained great advantages in India,\r\nthough the fall of Pondicherry was not yet known; while France had only\r\nconquered Minorca from England. She had also, it will be remembered,\r\ngained insecure possession of Hesse, Hanau, and Gottingen. England\r\nagreed to a separate negotiation on the basis of _uti possidetis_, but\r\nPitt would not commit himself as to the dates, for he was preparing the\r\nexpedition against Belle Ile, and intended that England should not lose\r\nthe advantage which would accrue from its success. He also declared that\r\nhis court would not desert the King of Prussia. Choiseul replied that\r\nneither would France desert her allies, and that the negotiation only\r\nconcerned the interests of the two powers. On this understanding the two\r\ncourts sent representatives the one to the other; the English\r\nrepresentative chosen by Pitt was Hans Stanley, and M. de Bussy was sent\r\nto London by Choiseul.\r\n\r\nSoon after they arrived at their destinations Belle Ile was conquered.\r\nPitt knew how deeply the national spirit of France would be wounded by\r\nthis blow; he promised to restore the island if adequate compensation\r\nwere made, and Choiseul professed himself willing to make important\r\nconcessions. On July 15, however, he made proposals of a less favourable\r\nkind than might have been expected. They were, briefly, that France\r\nshould cede Canada on certain conditions, one of which was that she\r\nshould have liberty to fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and dry cod on\r\nthe Newfoundland shore, and should have Cape Breton in sovereignty for a\r\nshelter for her ships, though she should not erect fortifications. She\r\nwould restore Minorca, and should receive back Guadeloupe and\r\nMariegalante; two of the neutral islands, Dominica and St. Vincent,\r\nshould be under her protection, and of the other two she should keep St.\r\nLucia and England should have Tobago. The rival claims in India were to\r\nbe settled on the basis of a treaty of 1755, before the late English\r\nvictories. England should restore either Senegal or Goree, for unless\r\nFrance had one of them, her West India possessions would be useless, as\r\nshe would have no port for the shipment of negroes. Belle Ile was to be\r\nrestored, and France would evacuate Hesse and Hanau. After preliminaries\r\nwere signed England was not to help Prussia, nor France Austria, but\r\nFrance would not surrender the territories conquered from the King of\r\nPrussia, for they were conquered and held in the name of the\r\nEmpress-queen. This stipulation was made in favour of Austria which had\r\nassented to the separate negotiation on condition that her interests\r\nwere guarded. The proposals were of a kind to suggest doubts as to\r\nChoiseul's sincerity. As a matter of fact he was secretly arranging a\r\nstrict alliance with Spain as a means of forcing England to make\r\nfavourable terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANISH AND FRENCH MEMORIALS._]\r\n\r\nSpain had three grievances against Great Britain. She complained that\r\nher ships had wrongfully been made prizes, that she was shut out from\r\nthe Newfoundland fishery, and that British settlements had been made on\r\nthe bay of Honduras. Charles III, of Spain had a strong leaning towards\r\na French alliance; he was much influenced by the family tie between\r\nhimself and the other Bourbon powers, and he considered that the\r\ndestruction of the French navy by Great Britain deprived Spain of a\r\nguarantee for the safety of her possessions in the western hemisphere.\r\nHe believed that by identifying the interests of Spain with those of\r\nFrance, he would gain a satisfactory settlement of his own claims and\r\nalso better terms for France than she could otherwise obtain. As early\r\nas September, 1760, the Count de Fuentes, the Spanish minister in\r\nLondon, presented to Pitt a memorial on the Newfoundland fishery, in\r\nwhich it was stated that a copy had been communicated to the court of\r\nFrance. Indignant at the implied threat, Pitt replied that he was at a\r\nloss to understand the meaning of such a communication, and that France\r\nhad nothing to do with the question.[35] A month later Dutens, secretary\r\nto the British embassy at Turin, sent him information which proved that\r\nthe King of Spain would not long remain a passive spectator of the\r\nwar.[36] Pitt was thus fully aware of the necessity for watchfulness as\r\nto the relations between France and Spain; the correspondence between\r\nFuentes and the Marquis Grimaldi, the Spanish minister at Paris, was\r\nregularly intercepted and its contents communicated by Pitt to his\r\ncolleagues. The two ambassadors were endeavouring to bring about an\r\nalliance between their king and Louis, and, on March 10, 1761, Fuentes\r\nwrote that \"if this is done, at the end of the year we shall have a\r\npeace to our liking and France's,\" and that England would be compelled\r\nby \"force and fear\" to do justice to Spain. Pitt soon showed him and\r\nChoiseul how unsafe it was to reckon on English fear.\r\n\r\nAlong with the French proposals of July 15, Bussy presented Pitt with a\r\nmemorial on the grievances of Spain, proposing that England should\r\nterminate her differences with that court, and declaring that the French\r\nking \"cannot disguise the danger he apprehends, and of which he must\r\nnecessarily partake if these objects which seem nearly to concern his\r\nCatholic majesty shall be the occasion of a war\". Pitt was furious at\r\nthis insult to his country and at once addressed Bussy in terms\r\ndifferent from the ordinary language of diplomacy. He declared in plain\r\nwords that the king would not allow the dispute with Spain to be\r\nblended in any manner whatever in the negotiation, and that any further\r\nattempt to blend them would be considered an affront. He returned the\r\nmemorial as \"wholly inadmissible\".[37] In answer to the French articles\r\nhe replied that Canada must be ceded unconditionally, and refused to\r\nsurrender Cape Breton or to allow France any part in the fisheries. Both\r\nPitt and Choiseul held the fisheries question to be of prime importance.\r\nIf France were shut out from them, she would, Pitt believed, permanently\r\nbe crippled as a maritime power, for apart from the value of the fish\r\nboth for victualling ships and in commerce the fisheries were a nursery\r\nfor a race of hardy seamen, and Pitt wished to prevent France from ever\r\nrestoring either her merchant marine or her naval strength. The second\r\ncrucial question in the negotiation concerned our allies. Pitt insisted\r\nthat Frederick should receive back the territories conquered from him by\r\nFrance, and that both England and France should be free to help their\r\nallies. Determined to give France no commercial advantage, he refused to\r\ncede either Senegal or Goree. England must have Minorca, but would agree\r\nto an equal partition of the neutral islands, and would restore Belle\r\nIle, Guadeloupe, and Mariegalante. He further rejected the date proposed\r\nas a basis for a peace in India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S ULTIMATUM._]\r\n\r\nPitt kept the negotiation with Bussy in his own hands, and met\r\nopposition in the cabinet with haughty determination. Newcastle and his\r\nparty were eager for peace, and, equally with Bussy, complained that the\r\ntone of his despatches was too peremptory. Bute resented what he\r\ndescribed as Pitt's insolence.[38] Nevertheless the king and he\r\nconsidered the French proposals unsatisfactory and were annoyed by the\r\nmemorial concerning the Spanish grievances, but Bute believed that\r\npatient negotiation would induce France to yield all that was in\r\ndispute. Accordingly, to Newcastle's consternation, he supported Pitt's\r\ndemands. Pitt's strongest opponent was the Duke of Bedford, who was\r\nurgently summoned to the council by Bute and Newcastle when they wanted\r\na champion against him. Upright and fairly able, Bedford owed his\r\npolitical prominence mainly to his rank and vast wealth; he was much\r\naddicted to sport and other pleasures, and allowed himself to be guided\r\nby a gang of greedy adherents of whom Rigby, a coarse and shameless\r\nplace-hunter, was the chief. Pitt laid his ultimatum to France before\r\nthe council on August 15. He had so far yielded to pressure as to offer\r\nFrance a limited right of fishing, and the island of St. Pierre as a\r\nshelter and port, provided it was kept unfortified. On the other crucial\r\nquestion his demand was unchanged; the Westphalian lands were to be\r\nrestored to Frederick, and both parties were to remain free to help\r\ntheir allies. His despatch was considered needlessly irritating, but he\r\nwould not allow a word to be altered. Bute would give no help against\r\nhim. Bedford, who had a violent temper, was so angry at being overborne,\r\nthat he declared that he would attend no more councils, and Newcastle\r\nwas reduced to whining despair. By the 18th, however, Bute came to an\r\nagreement with the Newcastle faction and promised to help them against\r\nPitt.[39]\r\n\r\nLord Bristol, our ambassador at Madrid, was instructed to remonstrate\r\nenergetically with General Wall, the Spanish minister, on the subject of\r\nBussy's memorial. He was to say that as regards the prizes there were\r\ncourts whose business it was to decide such matters, that England would\r\nnot allow Spain any share in the fishery, but was willing to receive\r\nrepresentations as to the Honduras settlements, provided they were not\r\nsent through France, and that any union of counsels with France would\r\nhinder an amicable arrangement. He was, further, to demand an\r\nexplanation of the naval preparations which Spain was making. He could\r\nobtain no satisfaction, and on August 31 sent Pitt a paper in which Wall\r\ndeclared that his master concurred in Bussy's memorial, and, while he\r\nprotested that no offence was intended, maintained that Spain and France\r\nhad a right to mix in the affairs each of the other \"for mutual\r\nassistance\". A declaration of war from Spain was, Bristol thought, not\r\nfar off.[40] On September 2 Stanley sent Pitt a copy of what he believed\r\nto be an article of a secret treaty between France and Spain, and wrote\r\nthat he was assured in Paris that Spain would immediately declare war,\r\nand that a treaty between the two powers only needed signature.[41]\r\nIntercepted letters between Fuentes and Grimaldi proved that a treaty\r\nhad been signed between them on August 15. This was the famous family\r\ncompact, the purport of which was not yet known in England. A fresh set\r\nof proposals was made by Choiseul, and Stanley was led to believe one\r\nday that peace was unlikely, and another that France would agree to\r\nterms and that \"the affair of Spain would be dropped\".[42] It became\r\nevident that Choiseul was trifling with England, and on September 15 the\r\ncabinet decided to recall Stanley forthwith.\r\n\r\nChoiseul was anxious to avoid an immediate breach between England and\r\nSpain, both because Spain was expecting the arrival of her\r\ntreasure-ships from America,[43] and also because her naval preparations\r\nwere incomplete. Pitt, who was convinced that Spain was intending to\r\ndeclare war, was anxious to strike while so grand an opportunity lasted.\r\nA cabinet council was held on the 19th. He was not present, but sent in\r\na paper signed by himself and Temple, urging that, in view of Wall's\r\navowal of \"a total union of counsels and interests\" between the two\r\nBourbon monarchies, Bristol should be ordered to return to England\r\nwithout taking leave, in fact, that war with Spain should at once be\r\ndeclared.[44] Unfortunately we had no _casus belli_ against Spain, and\r\ncould not found one on secret information. The council made a point of\r\nthis, and voted that a declaration of war would neither be just nor\r\nexpedient, but that Bristol should demand further and distinct\r\nassurances of the intentions of Spain. They knew that their decision\r\nwould probably lead to Pitt's resignation, and held anxious discussion,\r\nfor they were in great perplexity. Bute had hoped that peace would be\r\nmade, and then Pitt might be got rid of. Things were turning out\r\nawkwardly. \"If,\" he said, \"we had any view of peace, he should be less\r\nsolicitous what part Mr. Pitt took, but that, as the continuance of the\r\nwar seemed unavoidable, he thought that we should do what we could to\r\nhinder Mr. Pitt from going out, and thereby leaving the\r\nimpracticability of his own war upon us.\"[45] He and the rest of the\r\ncouncil knew that Pitt could conduct the war, and that they could not.\r\nThey agreed that peace with France might still be hoped for.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT AND HIS COLLEAGUES._]\r\n\r\nThat belief was strongly held by the king, and he was delighted by a\r\nletter from Stanley holding out hope of peace.[46] George believed\r\nChoiseul's assurances, and was angry with Pitt for treating them as mere\r\namusements. At a council on the 21st, Pitt, in an eloquent speech,\r\npointed out \"the almost certainty\" of success against the united forces\r\nof the Bourbon monarchies, but, said he, \"there is not an hour to lose\".\r\nHe regretted the concessions which he had been persuaded to make to\r\nFrance, and \"was determined _now_ to abide by his own opinion\". The\r\ncouncil adhered to its decision of the 19th. It was plain that Pitt and\r\nTemple would retire, and their colleagues discussed who should succeed\r\nPitt.[47] George's spirits were dashed by another letter from Stanley\r\nexpressing his belief that Spain was contemplating an attack on our ally\r\nthe King of Portugal.[48] He could not conceal his ill-temper, and let\r\nit be known that he wished to get rid of Pitt \"in all events\".[49] He\r\nwas soon gratified. Another cabinet meeting was held on October 2 to\r\ndecide what orders should be sent to Bristol. Pitt took the same ground\r\nas before, and declared that his opinion had been strengthened by one of\r\nGrimaldi's intercepted letters. Granville, the president of the council,\r\nsaid that he was convinced that a declaration of war with Spain would\r\nneither be just nor expedient. Newcastle, Devonshire, and Hardwicke\r\nconcurred. Bute said that such a war would be dangerous, and in any case\r\nshould be put off as long as possible. Anson thought that our ships were\r\nnot in a condition for it.[50] Mansfield feared that if England\r\ndeclared war against Spain the other maritime powers would think that\r\nshe was set on destroying them all. Ligonier believed that Spain could\r\nput 70,000 men in the field; she had made \"a great figure\" in Queen\r\nAnne's reign, and might do so again, and she would be joined by Naples\r\nwith an army of 20,000. Temple spoke on Pitt's side, and then appears to\r\nhave left the council-room in anger.\r\n\r\nPitt spoke again. He had, he said, \"been called by the sovereign, and in\r\nsome degree by the voice of the people, to assist the state when others\r\nhad abdicated\". He had succeeded in spite of opposition, for hardly an\r\nexpedition he had proposed, \"though most probable and attended with the\r\ngreatest success, had not beforehand been treated as chimerical and\r\nridiculous\". He knew the little interest he had either in council or\r\nparliament, but, said he, \"the papers which I have in my bag\" (meaning a\r\nletter from Bristol, and the paper which he sent from Wall) \"fix an\r\neternal stain on the crown of England, if proper measures are not taken\r\nupon them\"; and he would not acquiesce in sending no answer to Spain. He\r\nwas responsible, and he \"would not continue without having the\r\ndirection\". No one could be surprised at his going on no longer, for he\r\nwould be responsible for nothing but what he directed. Granville spoke\r\nsome words of compliment to him, but protested against his claim to\r\ndirect; when the king referred a matter to the council \"the opinion of\r\nthe majority must decide\". The council rejected Pitt's proposal.[51]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT RESIGNS OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Pitt had information as to the relations\r\nbetween France and Spain which he did not lay before his colleagues;\r\nindeed it is fairly certain that this was not the case. They knew that a\r\ntreaty was made, and that Spain had entered into it with hostile\r\nintentions. Pitt, with the insight of a statesman, was sure that war\r\nwith Spain was certain, and desired to strike before she was ready. His\r\ncolleagues, anxious for peace and fretting under his predominance,\r\nallowed themselves to be blinded by their hopes. They believed that\r\nFrance might yet shake off her engagement to Spain, and be willing to\r\nmake peace on terms to which Great Britain could agree; and they\r\ndetermined in any case to put off a declaration of war against Spain as\r\nlong as possible. Pitt resigned the seals on the 5th. So ended the\r\nministry of that great man who alone, at a critical time, had justly\r\nrated the strength and spirit of England, and had dared to rely upon\r\nthem, who had taught his fellow-countrymen how great things they might\r\ndo, had sent them forth, confident in that knowledge, to victory after\r\nvictory, and had laid broad and deep the foundations of Britain's\r\ncolonial empire.\r\n\r\nThe king's petulant wish was fulfilled, but though he and Bute approved\r\nof the decision of the council, Bute thought that Pitt's resignation was\r\n\"not favourable in the present minute to the king's affairs\". He would\r\nhave been well pleased if George could have found in Pitt a minister\r\nsubservient to his royal will; he could not endure that he should give\r\nstrength to a whig cabinet. Pitt took a line which the king disliked,\r\nyet Bute knew that he could ill be spared so long as the war lasted, and\r\nwas annoyed that his intrigues against him had been successful at an\r\ninopportune time. The leaders of the whig oligarchy, and specially\r\nNewcastle, Devonshire, and Bedford, sometimes inspired by Bute, and\r\nsometimes urging him on, had succeeded in driving Pitt out of office.\r\nWhat was to be their reward? They were to fall back into disunion, and\r\nwere consequently to find themselves unable to resist the growth of the\r\nroyal power. As for Pitt himself, his resignation dissolved the\r\nunnatural alliance between him and them. His position was tolerable only\r\nso long as he was their master, for in feeling he was not one of them.\r\nAs heartily as George himself he hated government by connexion, and like\r\nhim desired to break up all parties. He despised the corrupt practices\r\nby which the whigs strengthened themselves, and he had a deep reverence\r\nfor the crown. Yet his aims were totally different from those of the\r\nking. He would have broken party ties in order to form a strong\r\nadministration; he would have destroyed corruption and looked to the\r\nking and nation for the support of government, and relying on their\r\nsupport would have crushed the enemies of England. George, on the other\r\nhand, wanted ministers who would carry out his will; he was led to\r\nimitate and, indeed, to surpass the whigs in corrupt practices; he\r\ndesired that England should be at peace, and should take no part in\r\ncontinental politics. Pitt at last stood alone and unconnected. Which\r\nwould gain his support, the king or the whigs? The question runs through\r\nthe history of the party politics of England during the next eight\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt went to the king to give up the seals of his office, George\r\nspoke graciously to him. Always intoxicated by a peep into the royal\r\ncloset, Pitt burst into tears and replied in words of absurd\r\nself-abasement. The tidings of his resignation were received with\r\ngeneral indignation. For a moment his popularity was overclouded. He\r\naccepted a pension of L3,000 a year for three lives, and the dignity of\r\nBaroness of Chatham for his wife. With mean and studied[52] adroitness\r\nit was contrived that the _Gazette_ announcing his resignation should\r\npublish with it a notification of these grants, and a letter from\r\nStanley again holding out hope of a peace with France. For the grants it\r\nis, as Burke wrote, \"a shame that any defence should be necessary\".[53]\r\nPitt addressed a dignified letter to alderman Beckford, his chief\r\nfollower in the city, on the cause of his resignation and the\r\n\"unsolicited\" marks of royal favour which he had received. His\r\npopularity rose as high as ever. The city was specially strong for him,\r\nfor its merchants and traders owed him a deep debt of gratitude. At the\r\nlord mayor's feast on November 9, which was attended by the king, he had\r\nthe bad taste to draw off the cheers in the street to himself; he was\r\nloudly applauded, and the king coldly received. Bute's coach was\r\nescorted by hired bruisers; it was attacked amid cries of \"Damn all\r\nScotch rogues!\" \"No Bute!\" \"No Newcastle salmon!\" and Bute was rescued\r\nfrom the mob by constables. In parliament Pitt adopted a noble line; he\r\njustified his own conduct without blaming his late colleagues,\r\ndisregarded attacks upon himself, and urged the ministers to act firmly,\r\nand the house to give them its united support.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WAR DECLARED AGAINST SPAIN._]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded as secretary of state by Lord Egremont, a man of small\r\nability; the leadership of the commons was committed to Grenville, and\r\nBedford took Temple's place as privy seal. Events soon vindicated the\r\nwisdom of Pitt's demand for instant war with Spain. Bristol in vain\r\ndemanded satisfactory assurances from that court. At first Wall's\r\nanswers were conciliatory, but naval preparations still went on. By\r\nNovember 2 all the treasure-ships had arrived safely. Their arrival\r\ncaused a marked change in Wall's tone; he no longer disguised the\r\nhostile feeling of his court. At Christmas the Family Compact was\r\npublished. It was of the same character as the compacts of 1733 and\r\n1743, and arranged a strict alliance between the sovereigns of the house\r\nof Bourbon. It was formed between the Kings of France and Spain, the\r\nKing of Spain also engaging for the King of the Two Sicilies, and it\r\nguaranteed the dominions of the three kings and of the Duke of Parma.\r\nEach sovereign was to send specified assistance to any of the others who\r\nmight require it, but wars undertaken by France in consequence of\r\nengagements to German or northern states were not to be cases in which\r\nSpain should be bound to send help, \"unless some maritime power should\r\ntake part in them\". These words pointed directly to Great Britain. On\r\nJanuary 2, 1762, war was declared against Spain. France and Spain forced\r\nour ally, the King of Portugal, to declare war, and in the spring Spain\r\ninvaded his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis new war afforded Bedford an opportunity for moving in parliament\r\nfor the recall of the British troops from Germany. Bute, though equally\r\ndesirous for their recall, opposed the motion as inopportune;\r\ncircumstances, he said, had arisen which promised to enable us to lessen\r\nexpenses and reduce the war. The motion was lost. The declaration of\r\ndisagreement between two cabinet ministers on so serious a question\r\nillustrates the difference between the cabinet system of the time and\r\nthat of to-day. The circumstances to which Bute referred were the death\r\nof Frederick's enemy, Elizabeth of Russia, on January 5, and the\r\naccession of Peter III., who was his ardent admirer. Peter restored East\r\nPrussia to Frederick, ordered Tchernitchev and his 20,000 men to\r\nwithdraw from Glatz, and entered into negotiations for an alliance with\r\nPrussia, which was concluded later. Frederick's position was totally\r\nchanged. Bute hoped that he would use this change of fortune to make\r\npeace; it naturally caused him to be more eager to prosecute the war for\r\nSilesia. When he applied for the renewal of the English subsidy of\r\nL670,000, Bute informed him that it would only be granted on condition\r\nthat he gave assurances that he was ready to make peace. This Frederick\r\nwould not do. Other difficulties arose between the two courts. Bute\r\ncomplained that Frederick was secretly negotiating with Russia for a\r\nseparate treaty which would hinder a general peace, and thwart our\r\npolicy in the north by encouraging Russia to enforce the surrender of\r\nSchleswig. Frederick also had his complaints. Early in the year Bute\r\nmade certain efforts for a general peace, and Frederick asserted that\r\nBute had suggested that Russia should force him to surrender Silesia to\r\nAustria. Bute was deceived as regards the tsar's intentions, and his\r\nwords were spoken in the interest of Prussia. Nevertheless, Frederick\r\nwould not be pacified, and he further accused Bute of trying to dissuade\r\nPeter from making an alliance with him. This charge was flatly denied by\r\nBute. It rests solely on the assertion of Prince Galitzin, the Russian\r\nambassador in London, and there is no reason for doubting Bute's\r\nword.[54] As Frederick refused to give any pledge as to the terms on\r\nwhich he would make peace, the British government refused the subsidy.\r\n\r\nPitt having been driven from office, the king and Bute turned upon\r\nNewcastle. Bute and Grenville treated him with discourtesy; he found\r\nhimself deprived of the power of dispensing patronage; the king did not\r\neven consult him as to the new peerages granted in the spring. As an old\r\nwhig he set a high value on the continental connexion formed by the\r\nalliance with Frederick, and cared more for the war in Europe than for\r\nnaval expeditions. He was deeply annoyed by the desire of Bute,\r\nGrenville, and Bedford to withdraw our troops from Germany and by the\r\nrefusal of the subsidy. He would not, he declared, \"be Grenville's tool\r\nand load the nation with four or five millions to carry on a ridiculous,\r\ndestructive maritime war\".[55] Nevertheless he clung to office.\r\nDevonshire and Hardwicke agreed with him, and attached themselves to a\r\nsection of the whigs who acknowledged the Duke of Cumberland as their\r\nhead. Newcastle proposed that a vote of L2,000,000 should be asked for,\r\nL1,000,000 as usual for the German war and L1,000,000 for the war in\r\nPortugal. Bute and Grenville maintained that only L1,000,000 was wanted.\r\nThat, he said, implied the abandonment of the German war. The question\r\nwas decided against him in a cabinet meeting on May 4. Bitterly as he\r\nfelt this defeat on a matter concerning his own office, the treasury, he\r\nwould not do more than threaten to resign, and found an excuse for\r\nretaining office for the present. George and Bute were determined that\r\nhe should go; George was ungracious, Bute uncivil. His friends urged him\r\nto resign. At last he brought himself to the point and resigned on the\r\n25th.[56]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BUTE'S ADMINISTRATION._]\r\n\r\nOn his resignation the king spoke kindly to the old man, as indeed he\r\nwell might, for the duke had spent a long life and a vast fortune in the\r\nservice of his house; he had, it is said, reduced his income from\r\nL25,000 to L6,000 a year in securing support for government by means\r\nwhich, whatever we may esteem them now, were then considered becoming to\r\na man of his wealth and station. George pressed him to accept a pension.\r\nHe refused, declaring that the gracious sense which the king expressed\r\nof the sacrifices he had made for his royal house was all the recompense\r\nhe desired.[57] If Pitt's acceptance of rewards needs no defence,\r\nNewcastle's refusal of them demands admiration. Bute succeeded him as\r\nfirst lord of the treasury. Several other changes were made in the\r\nadministration. George Grenville became secretary of state in Bute's\r\nplace, and Sir Francis Dashwood chancellor of the exchequer in\r\nsuccession to Barrington, who took Grenville's office as treasurer of\r\nthe navy. Dashwood was utterly ignorant of the rudiments of finance, and\r\nwas scandalously immoral; his house, Medmenham abbey, was the\r\nmeeting-place of the Hell-fire club, of which he was the founder, and he\r\ntook a foremost part in the childish mummery, the debauchery, and\r\nblasphemy of the \"Franciscans,\" as his companions called themselves.\r\nLord Halifax, a man of popular manners, loose morals, and small ability,\r\nsucceeded Anson at the admiralty; Henley remained lord chancellor,\r\nBedford privy seal, and Fox paymaster. Devonshire had ceased to attend\r\nmeetings of the cabinet but was still lord chamberlain. The king and\r\nBute had won a signal success; the whig administration was broken up and\r\nBute was virtually master of the government.\r\n\r\nThe Russian alliance more than made up to Frederick for the loss of the\r\nEnglish subsidy; Tchernitchev and his army were at his disposal.\r\nSuddenly his hopes were clouded over. On July 10 Peter was deposed and\r\nsoon afterwards was murdered. He was succeeded by his wife Catherine,\r\nwho did not share his admiration for the Prussian king. Frederick was\r\nfacing the Austrians in Silesia when orders came to Tchernitchev to lead\r\nhis army home. Tchernitchev delayed his departure, remaining merely as\r\nan onlooker, to give the Prussians the support of his presence. On the\r\n21st Frederick won the decisive battle of Burkersdorf, and a few weeks\r\nlater was master of Silesia. In western Germany, where the war more\r\nimmediately concerned England, Prince Ferdinand showed consummate skill\r\nin forcing the French to act on the defensive. On June 24 the allies\r\ndefeated them at Wilhelmsthal. The victory was decided by Granby, who,\r\nafter a fierce engagement, destroyed the pick of the French army under\r\nStainville. A series of successes followed; Gottingen was evacuated, the\r\nlarger part of Hesse reconquered, and Cassel and some other places which\r\nremained to the French were blockaded. The French army of reserve under\r\nConde marched from the Lower Rhine to help Soubise; a junction was\r\neffected to the north of Frankfort, and the French attempted to open up\r\ncommunications with Cassel. After much manoeuvring about the Lahn, no\r\nway seemed possible for them save by crossing the Ohm. The passage at\r\nBruckenmuhle, near Amoneburg, was held by the allies. The French\r\nattacked on September 21. During the last four hours of the conflict,\r\nwhich lasted the whole day, the defence was taken up by Granby, and was\r\nmaintained with splendid determination until at last the French retired.\r\nCassel surrendered on November 1, and the war ended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BRITISH SUCCESSES._]\r\n\r\nSuccess attended the arms of Great Britain in other quarters. Pitt's\r\nspirit still animated her efforts. How far the government adopted his\r\nplans and arrangements cannot, perhaps, be decided with certainty. He\r\nhad large ideas, which probably included not merely the conquest of\r\nMartinique and Havana, but also an attack on Louisiana. The enemies of\r\nthe government attributed to him the victories which followed his\r\nresignation.[58] The ministers naturally claimed the credit of them and\r\ncertainly made arrangements for them,[59] probably following lines\r\nalready marked out by Pitt. Rodney, who was in command on the Leeward\r\nislands station, acting in co-operation with General Monckton, reduced\r\nMartinique in February. The fall of that island, the seat of the\r\ngovernment of France in the West Indies, the centre of her privateering\r\nexpeditions, and her chief mart in those parts, was followed by the\r\nsurrender of Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, and England became\r\nmistress of all the Windward islands. Against these losses France could\r\nset only a momentary possession of St. John's, Newfoundland, which was\r\nspeedily retaken. Spain had to pay heavily for her rashness in espousing\r\nthe French cause. Her troops, indeed, entered Portugal, overran\r\nTraz-os-Montes, and threatened Oporto, while south of the Douro they\r\nadvanced as far as Almeida and took it. But the aspect of affairs\r\nchanged when 8,000 British soldiers landed at Lisbon and the Count of\r\nLippe-Buckeburg took the command. He was ably seconded by General\r\nBurgoyne, and the Spaniards were forced to retreat within their own\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nSo far as England was concerned the war in Portugal was a small matter.\r\nIt was through her power on the sea that she was able to reap a rich\r\nharvest from her war with Spain. In March a fleet under Pocock, carrying\r\n10,000 men under the command of the Earl of Albemarle, sailed for\r\nHavana. Off Cape St. Nicholas, Pocock was joined by a reinforcement sent\r\nby Rodney. There was no time to lose, for the hurricane season was near;\r\nand he therefore took his ships through the shoals of the Bahama channel\r\ninstead of to the south of Cuba, and brought them out safely on June 5,\r\na notable piece of seamanship, for the channel was little known. The\r\ntroops laid siege to Fort Moro, which commanded Havana. The Spaniards\r\nmade a vigorous defence, and the British suffered terribly from disease;\r\nat one time 5,000 soldiers and 3,000 seamen were incapacitated by\r\nsickness. Much-needed reinforcements arrived from New York, and, on July\r\n30, the fort was taken by storm after a siege of forty-five days. The\r\ntown capitulated on August 12. The reduction of the island deprived\r\nSpain of a rich colony, an important centre of trade, and, more, of a\r\nport which commanded the route of her treasure-ships from the Gulf of\r\nMexico. An immense booty was secured, L3,000,000 in money besides\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time England dealt Spain a heavy blow on the other side\r\nof the world. An expedition under General Draper sailed from Madras in a\r\nfleet commanded by Admiral Cornish, and on September 25 landed at\r\nManila. The Spaniards, though unprepared, refused to surrender, and the\r\nplace was taken by storm. Large government stores were seized by the\r\nvictors, but the British commanders allowed the inhabitants to ransom\r\ntheir property for 4,000,000 dollars. Half this sum was paid in bills on\r\nthe Spanish treasury which were rejected at Madrid, and the money was\r\nnever paid. With Manila the whole of the Philippines passed to Great\r\nBritain. Though a privateering expedition undertaken with the Portuguese\r\nagainst Buenos Ayres was beaten off with heavy loss, Spain was unable to\r\ndefend the sources of her wealth against the British navy. In May the\r\ncapture of the _Hermione_, from Lima, brought over L500,000 to the\r\ncaptains and crews of the frigate and sloop engaged in the business. A\r\nglorious procession passed through London, carrying the treasure to the\r\nTower, on August 12, when people were rejoicing at an event scarcely to\r\nbe remembered with equal satisfaction, the birth of the future king,\r\nGeorge IV. Two of the ships belonging to the Manila expedition also made\r\na prize of an Acapulco ship with a cargo worth 3,000,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer Bute treated with France through the Count de Viri.\r\nBedford urged concessions upon him, and his fear lest the negotiations\r\nshould be broken off made him willing to agree to Choiseul's demands. He\r\nwould, indeed, have yielded more than he did, if Grenville had not\r\nchecked him in the cabinet. In September Bedford was sent to Paris to\r\nsettle the preliminaries. Peace was by no means desired by the English\r\npeople; they were proud of their victories and were disgusted that Bute\r\nshould have the management of affairs. Bedford was hooted in the streets\r\nof London as he set out for Paris. Both Bute and his enemies prepared\r\nfor a struggle. Bute, as usual, employed the press to fight for him, and\r\nengaged the services of a number of pamphleteers and newspaper-writers.\r\nHis character as a patron of men of letters rests chiefly on the money\r\nwhich he spent in this way, though it must be set to his credit that he\r\nprocured a pension for Samuel Johnson without stipulating for any\r\nreturn. Among his hired scribes was Smollett, who edited a paper for him\r\ncalled _The Briton_. The other side, too, was active. In obedience to\r\nFrederick's instructions the Prussian ambassadors took part in exciting\r\npopular discontent with the government; and were justly reproved by\r\nGrenville for their preposterous conduct. Bute was vigorously assailed\r\nin print. The publication of _The Briton_ called forth the ironically\r\nnamed _North Briton_, of which the first number appeared in June. It was\r\nbrought out by John Wilkes, member for Aylesbury, a clever and\r\ndissipated man of fashion, with literary tastes, great courage, an\r\nexcellent wit, too often employed in obscenity, and a remarkably ugly\r\nface. He was incorrupt and his political professions were probably\r\nsincere. Behind him stood Temple, ever ready to instigate others to stab\r\nthe objects of his hate. The court party was strengthened by grants of\r\npeerages, preferments, and other good things, and \"the king's friends,\"\r\nas they began to call themselves, became a recognised body. Yet Bute\r\nfeared that parliament would be hostile, and made overtures to Newcastle\r\nand Hardwicke, hoping to secure the duke's influence; but they would not\r\nbe cajoled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SECURING A MAJORITY._]\r\n\r\nA majority for the peace had to be insured before the preliminaries came\r\nbefore parliament. Grenville was dissatisfied with some of the articles,\r\nand would in any case have been too scrupulous for the work which had to\r\nbe done. Bute was driven to apply to Henry Fox, whom both the king and\r\nhe cordially disliked. Fox, who had previously sold his support to Bute\r\nat the price of a peerage for his wife, was offered Grenville's place as\r\nsecretary of state and a peerage for himself, if he would take the\r\nmanagement of the commons. \"We must,\" George said, \"call in bad men to\r\ngovern bad men.\" Fox at once broke with the whigs and accepted the\r\nleadership, but he refused the seals, for he preferred to continue in\r\nthe more lucrative office of paymaster of the forces, which he had used\r\nduring the last six years as a means of amassing a great fortune. As\r\npaymaster he had large sums of public money in his hands to meet calls\r\nat fixed periods. Holders of the office were wont to employ such sums\r\nfor their own benefit. Pitt would not do so, and left the office a poor\r\nman. Fox had no such scruples. During the war the government often\r\nobtained ready money by issuing bills at 20 per cent discount. Fox\r\nbought these bills with the public money which lay in his hands. He\r\nalso used the public money in operating in government stock and gained\r\nimmense profits from the fluctuations of the funds, for as a minister he\r\nof course knew more about the chances of peace than the public.[60]\r\nGrenville was forced to resign the leadership to him, and the office of\r\nsecretary to Halifax, and take the admiralty in exchange. Fox set about\r\nthe business of securing a majority in the commons by bribing members.\r\nIn one day L25,000 was paid out of the treasury, and it is said even so\r\nsmall a sum as L200 was not refused.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by Fox's success, George gave the whigs a lesson on the\r\nfruits of opposition. The king, so the court party said, would be king;\r\nthe prerogative was to shine out. Devonshire, the \"prince of the whigs,\"\r\nwas forced to resign the chamberlain's staff; the king treated him\r\nuncivilly and with his own hand struck his name from the list of privy\r\ncouncillors. The whigs were enraged at this high-handed proceeding. The\r\nMarquis of Rockingham resigned the bed-chamber, and George received his\r\nresignation with indifference. Worse was yet to come. Overtures were\r\nmade to Pitt by the whigs who gathered round Cumberland, but he would\r\nnot connect himself with them. They had defeated his policy, and though\r\nhe desired Bute's removal, he would not help to turn him out in order to\r\nput Newcastle back in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE TERMS OF PEACE._]\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of peace were signed on November 3, and laid before\r\nparliament on the 29th. France agreed to restore Minorca and to evacuate\r\nthe territories of Hanover, Hesse, Brunswick, and Prussia. Both parties\r\nwere to withdraw their troops from Germany. Dunkirk was to be\r\ndismantled. France resigned Canada, Nova Scotia, and Cape Breton,\r\ntogether with some territory hitherto claimed as part of Louisiana.\r\nSpain ceded Florida and received back Havana and Manila. Portugal was\r\nrestored to its position as before the war. Great Britain restored to\r\nFrance Belle Ile, Guadeloupe, Mariegalante, Martinique, and St. Lucia,\r\nand retained Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago. France was\r\nallowed a right of fishery in the gulf of St. Lawrence and on the\r\nNewfoundland coast, and received the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon\r\nas shelters, covenanting not to fortify them. Spain gave up its claim\r\nto the Newfoundland fishery, agreed that the dispute concerning prizes\r\nshould be settled by the courts, and acknowledged the right to cut\r\nlogwood on the Bay of Honduras. In Africa England restored Goree to\r\nFrance and kept Senegal. In India France abandoned her pretensions to\r\nconquests since 1749, and received back the factories which she had at\r\nthat date. As a compensation to Spain for the loss of Florida, France\r\nceded to her Louisiana; a Spanish governor arrived there in 1766, but\r\nthough Spain had posts and settlements in the province, she can scarcely\r\nbe said to have ever had any effective hold upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious peace for Great Britain; it marks a signal epoch in\r\nher imperial history. But it was not so advantageous as she had a right\r\nto expect. Financially peace was desirable, for the national debt of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, which before the war stood, as has already\r\nbeen stated, at L72,505,572, had risen to L132,716,049, but her\r\nresources were by no means exhausted; she could have continued the war\r\nwithout distress. It is fairly certain that better terms might have been\r\nobtained if the government had carried on the negotiations in a\r\ndifferent spirit. Martinique, specially valuable to a maritime power,\r\nwas surrendered without compensation; Manila was simply thrown away\r\nthrough careless haste; Goree, on which the French slave trade depended,\r\nmight easily have been retained. Grenville protested against the\r\nsurrender of Guadeloupe, and it was decided on when he was too ill to\r\nattend the council. Florida was a poor exchange for Havana, the richest\r\nof our conquests. Whether Pitt's policy of obtaining commercial\r\nmonopolies by force of arms was economically sound, and whether the\r\nrestoration of the French navy would have been impeded so materially by\r\nexclusion from the fishery as he believed, are questions on which we\r\nneed not dwell here. The treaty must be judged according to the beliefs\r\nof the time. As it ceded valuable conquests without adequate\r\ncompensation, and encouraged France again to enter on a naval and\r\ncommercial policy by restoring to her Goree, colonies in the West\r\nIndies, and her factories in India, and by granting her a share in the\r\nfisheries, it was justly condemned as unsatisfactory. As regards the\r\ncontinental war, the change in Frederick's position was sufficient\r\nreason for our withdrawal from a quarrel which did not concern us. Yet\r\nhe had some cause of complaint, for though the treaty provided that the\r\nFrench should evacuate his territories, it did not provide that the\r\nterritories should be handed over to him. He gained possession of them\r\nwithout difficulty, but for that he owed no thanks to England. He\r\nbelieved that he had been betrayed and deserted, and adopted an\r\nunfriendly attitude, which was a hindrance to England's foreign policy\r\nin later years.\r\n\r\nAt home the peace was widely condemned. When parliament met on November\r\n25, Bute's coach was attacked and he was in some danger. In the lords\r\nthe address approving the preliminaries was passed without a division.\r\nIn the commons the debate had begun when Pitt entered the house. He was\r\nsuffering from gout, and was carried by his servants within the bar.\r\nDressed in black velvet, and leaning on a crutch, he advanced slowly to\r\nhis seat, his limbs swathed in wrappings, and his face pale with\r\nsuffering. Yet he spoke for three hours and forty minutes. After\r\ndeclaring that he was unconnected with any party, he criticised the\r\nvarious articles of the treaty, pointing out that they surrendered\r\nmaritime and commercial advantages which would have been doubly valuable\r\nbecause our gain would have been the loss of France. The treatment of\r\nFrederick he denounced as base and treacherous. The address was carried\r\nby 319 to 65. The definitive treaty was signed at Paris on February 10,\r\n1763, and on the 15th Prussia and Austria made peace at Hubertsburg. The\r\nmajority was largely obtained by corruption. Many members, however, no\r\ndoubt welcomed the peace, even though they were not fully satisfied with\r\nits terms. The rout of the whigs was completed by their disunion; some\r\nwho would have voted against the address were discouraged by Pitt's\r\nattitude of solitary independence.[61] The king had succeeded in\r\nbreaking up the whig party, and there was no organised opposition. The\r\ncourt was triumphant. On hearing the result of the division, the\r\nprincess-dowager is said to have exclaimed, \"Now my son is King of\r\nEngland!\" The victory was followed up by a general proscription of the\r\nwhigs; Newcastle, Grafton, and Rockingham were dismissed from their\r\nlord-lieutenancies. Nor was vengeance confined to the great. All whigs\r\nwho held places were deprived of them, and even poor clerks and\r\nexcisemen lost the employments bestowed on them by whig ministers. Fox\r\nurged on the execution of this shameful business. Every effort was made\r\nto obtain congratulatory addresses on the peace from municipal bodies,\r\nand money was offered for them. London and several other places refused\r\nto be won over by any means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CIDER TAX._]\r\n\r\nThe unpopularity of the administration was heightened by its finance.\r\nDashwood's scheme for the supplies included a loan of L3,000,000, which\r\nwas negotiated on such extravagant terms that the scrip soon rose to a\r\npremium of 11 per cent. The loan was not open to public competition, it\r\nwas distributed among the chief supporters of the government; nine of\r\nthem, it is said, cleared each L20,000, Fox L10,000, and so on, while\r\nthe nation lost L385,000 by the transaction. It was a new form of\r\ncorruption, specially dangerous because indirect.[62] More general\r\nindignation was excited by the proposal of a tax of four shillings a\r\nhogshead on cider, to be paid by the maker and collected as an excise.\r\nThe tax was excessive in amount, onerous in its conditions, and unfair\r\nin its incidence, for it fell equally on the poorest and the most\r\nvaluable cider, and pressed solely on particular districts. It was,\r\nhowever, as an extension of the excise laws that it was specially\r\noffensive to public feeling. That was a matter on which Englishmen were\r\nextremely jealous. Thirty years before a proposal for an extended excise\r\nnearly wrecked the power of Sir Robert Walpole, who wisely yielded to\r\nthe storm. By Dashwood's scheme farmers were liable to have the privacy\r\nof their homes invaded by the visits of excisemen. Disturbances broke\r\nout in the cider counties, and troops were moved into them. The\r\nexcitement was general. London petitioned against the tax, and its\r\nexample was followed by many other corporations and counties. Bute was\r\nviolently assailed in print, by Wilkes in prose and by his friend\r\nChurchill in verse. A parliamentary opposition was organised; it was\r\njoined by Pitt and Temple, and had its headquarters at Wildman's tavern\r\nin Albemarle Street. Pitt spoke strongly against the tax in the commons.\r\nIt was defended by Grenville, who in the course of his speech constantly\r\ndemanded where another tax could be laid. Mimicking his querulous tone,\r\nPitt repeated aloud the words of an old ditty, \"Gentle shepherd, tell me\r\nwhere\". The nickname, Gentle shepherd, stuck by Grenville. The bill\r\npassed the commons and was sent up to the lords. For the first time\r\nsince the revolution the lords divided on a money-bill, and voted 49\r\nagainst, to 83 for its committal.\r\n\r\nA few days later, on April 7, Bute announced that ill-health compelled\r\nhim to retire from office. The announcement caused general surprise, but\r\nhe had for some weeks determined to retire, and had arranged with the\r\nking that Grenville should succeed him. That he should have taken office\r\nwas, Pitt wrote, more astonishing than his departing from it.[63] He\r\ntook office with the intention of carrying out the king's policy of\r\nbreaking up the whig phalanx and bringing about a peace. Both objects\r\nwere accomplished. Though still strong in votes in the commons, he had\r\nfew allies of any weight, for Bedford was offended with him. The newly\r\nformed opposition caused him uneasiness, specially as it included Pitt\r\nand Temple; it was strong in the lords, and he feared its influence in\r\ntheir chamber.[64] Though his health was not materially affected, he was\r\ndoubtless weary of a task which he must have learned was too great for\r\nhis abilities. He knew that he was generally hated by the people, and\r\nfeared that if he remained longer in office, his unpopularity would\r\nbecome injurious to the king. Before his resignation he provided\r\nhandsomely for his relations and friends at the expense of the nation;\r\nreversions of L52,000 a year were distributed among them. Fox was\r\nrewarded by his creation as Baron Holland, and managed to keep the pay\r\noffice for two years longer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] _Chatham Correspondence_, ii., 69 _n._\r\n\r\n[36] Dutens, _Memoires d'un voyageur_, i., 178-79.\r\n\r\n[37] _Parliamentary Hist._, xv., 1044-47.\r\n\r\n[38] Newcastle to Bedford, July 2, 1761; _Bedford Correspondence_, iii.,\r\n19.\r\n\r\n[39] Newcastle to Hardwicke, Aug. 17, 1761, Add.

George could not have wished to keep a minister in office who was\r\nhated by his people; that would have been contrary to the idea of a\r\npatriot king, and would in time have made him unpopular. Nor was he\r\nperhaps altogether satisfied with Bute's conduct in office; for in later\r\nlife he observed that he was \"deficient in political firmness\".[66] Bute\r\nwas to continue to be useful to him in another capacity in which\r\npolitical firmness was not so important; he was to be the king's private\r\nadviser, and help him to select and manage his responsible ministers.\r\nThrough his instrumentality, George had already secured a set of\r\nministers who would, they both believed, be content to carry out the\r\nking's will. Grenville, though he had opposed Bute in the cabinet with\r\nreference to the negotiations with France, professed that as prime\r\nminister he would try to win his complete approval, and with only one\r\nexception allowed Bute to form his administration for him. Bute and his\r\nmaster thought they had secured a useful tool, a subservient and\r\nhard-working drudge. They were mistaken in their man; Grenville was\r\nindependent and self-confident. He took the two offices of first lord of\r\nthe treasury and chancellor of the exchequer. Dashwood retired with Bute\r\nand the barony of Despencer was called out of abeyance in his favour.\r\nHalifax and Egremont remained secretaries of state and Henley lord\r\nchancellor. Bedford distrusted Bute and refused to take office. The new\r\nadministration promised to exercise economy, and Grenville took care\r\nthat the pledge should be redeemed. Its frugality did not make it\r\npopular; it did not command the confidence of the nation, and was\r\ngenerally considered a feeble continuation of its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe king prorogued parliament on April 19, 1763; his speech described\r\nthe peace as honourable to his crown, and claimed, or at least implied,\r\nthat it had induced the enemies of the Prussian king \"to agree to a\r\npeace which he had approved\". On the 23rd appeared No. 45 of the _North\r\nBriton_ with a violent denunciation of the speech. It declared that the\r\nking had given \"the sanction of his sacred name to the most odious\r\nmeasures and to the most unjustifiable public declarations from a throne\r\never renowned for truth, honour, and unsullied virtue\". That the\r\nministers were responsible for the king's speech was well understood,\r\nand was clearly recognised in the article. George took the article as\r\nconveying an accusation of falsehood against himself personally, and\r\nthere was some excuse for this interpretation of it. Other numbers of\r\nthe paper had been violent, and had been passed by without notice. His\r\npresent ministers were not deficient in political firmness; he ordered\r\nthem to prosecute the writer. Halifax thereupon issued a general\r\nwarrant, that is a warrant directed against persons not named, ordering\r\nthe king's messengers to search for the authors, printers, and\r\npublishers of the _North Briton_, arrest them and seize their papers.\r\nWarrants of this kind to be executed on persons not named, without\r\nevidence of their identity or guilt, had hitherto been held lawful, but\r\nthey were subversive of the liberty of the subject and contrary to the\r\nspirit of the constitution. During three days forty-nine persons were\r\narrested under this warrant. Among them were the avowed publisher of the\r\n_North Briton_, the printer, and his workmen. They declared that Wilkes\r\nwas the author.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PROCEEDINGS IN WILKES'S CASE._]\r\n\r\nWilkes was arrested under the general warrant on the 30th, and carried\r\nbefore the secretaries of state; his house was searched and his papers\r\nseized. He was committed to the Tower. He hoped, he said, that he might\r\nhave the room in which Egremont's father had been confined as a rebel,\r\nand, referring to the popular belief as to the consequences of the\r\ndirty habits of Bute's fellow-countrymen, in any case, one which had not\r\nbeen tenanted by a Scot. Temple at once applied on his behalf for a writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_, which was granted by Pratt, chief justice of the\r\ncommon pleas, but as Wilkes was no longer in the custody of the\r\nmessengers, they could not produce him. He was kept in close\r\nconfinement; Temple and the Duke of Grafton who went to see him were not\r\nadmitted, and even his solicitor was denied access to him. A new writ\r\nwas issued, and on May 3 he was brought before the court of common\r\npleas. He pleaded his privilege as a member of parliament. Pratt\r\ndelivered judgment on the 6th and decided that he was entitled to the\r\nprivilege of parliament, which extended to all offences save treason,\r\nfelony, and breach of the peace. The other judges concurred, and he was\r\nset at liberty. The crowd which had collected in Westminster Hall\r\nreceived the result of the trial with loud applause, and escorted Wilkes\r\nto his house in Great George Street. Meanwhile Egremont had in the\r\nking's name ordered Temple, the lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, to\r\ndeprive Wilkes of his commission as colonel of the Bucks militia. In\r\nforwarding this order to Wilkes, Temple added some complimentary\r\nexpressions, and on the 7th the earl was dismissed both from his\r\nlieutenancy and the privy council.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons who were arrested on the general warrant brought actions\r\nagainst the messengers. In the first of these suits Pratt, setting aside\r\nevil precedents, declared general warrants to be illegal. A\r\nmaster-printer obtained L400 damages, one journeyman L300, and others\r\nL200. Wilkes sued Wood, the under-secretary of state, for ransacking his\r\nhouse, and the jury awarded him L1,000 damages. He also began actions\r\nfor false imprisonment against the two secretaries of state. His suit\r\nagainst Egremont was cut short by the earl's death on August 20. Halifax\r\ntook advantage of various legal devices to delay the hearing of the suit\r\nagainst himself, and it was not decided until six years later. Temple,\r\nwho had paid Wilkes's law expenses, wished him to avoid giving further\r\ncause of offence. Wilkes, however, set up a press in his own house,\r\nreprinted the _North Briton_ in volumes, and printed other matter also.\r\nThe arbitrary proceedings of the government in this case excited much\r\nadverse feeling, especially in London, and gave a fresh impetus to the\r\ndiscontent in the cider districts. They were attributed to Bute's\r\ninfluence. In some western villages a man in Scottish dress led about an\r\nass decorated with a blue ribbon and wearing a paper crown; and at\r\nExeter an effigy of Bute remained hanging on a gibbet for a fortnight,\r\nno one daring to remove it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MINISTERIAL CHANGES._]\r\n\r\nGeorge, though at first well pleased with the new administration, soon\r\nsaw that it lacked strength. He made an attempt to enlist Hardwicke and\r\nNewcastle, but they would not take office without their party. Bute\r\nadvised an offer to Bedford, who declared that he would not join the\r\ngovernment unless Bute would undertake to retire, not only from the\r\ncourt, but from London. Negotiations were also carried on with Pitt,\r\nwhom Bute was most anxious to secure for the king. Pitt made it clearly\r\nunderstood that he would not take office with Bedford, the man most\r\nresponsible for the peace, nor would he come in alone. In spite of\r\nPitt's objection to him, Bedford, who did not care for office, advised\r\nthe king to take him. George was dissatisfied with his ministers; he was\r\nannoyed by their unpopularity and by the growth of a spirit of\r\nturbulence among the lower classes, and personally was wearied by the\r\nconstant interviews and the long harangues which Grenville inflicted\r\nupon him. Bute, too, was not finding Grenville so anxious to win his\r\napproval as he expected, and on Egremont's death had an interview with\r\nPitt. The result was satisfactory; and George, much to Grenville's\r\ndisgust, told him that he meant to ask Pitt to enter the administration,\r\nand would \"do it as cheap as he could,\" with as few changes as possible.\r\nPitt had an interview with the king on August 27. Both evidently thought\r\nthat there was nothing to prevent him from taking office, and he\r\ncommunicated with Devonshire, Newcastle, and Rockingham. The next day\r\nGeorge seems to have changed his mind; he told Grenville that Pitt's\r\nterms were too hard. Bute is said to have instigated this change, and it\r\nis probable that both he and the king were disappointed at finding that\r\nPitt meant to bring in with him several of the whig leaders. Pitt had a\r\nsecond interview with the king on the 29th, and George is said to have\r\nclosed it with the words: \"Well, Mr. Pitt, I see this will not do. My\r\nhonour is concerned and I must support it.\" Pitt's proposals were\r\nprobably exaggerated by the ministerial party. It is certain that he\r\nproposed several changes, and the admission of some of the leading\r\nwhigs, and that either he or the king suggested Temple for the treasury.\r\nGeorge had made up his mind before the interview that it would probably\r\nbe useless. Both he and Bute would gladly have secured Pitt's support,\r\nbut they wanted him to take office alone, or at least not with a party.\r\nGeorge had no mind for another whig administration with Pitt as its\r\nmaster-spirit.\r\n\r\nHe again turned to Bedford and told him that Pitt had stipulated that he\r\nwas to have no office, even about the court, at that time, though in\r\nfuture years he might be permitted to hold a court appointment, and that\r\nno favour should be shown to any one concerned in the peace. George may\r\nwell have believed that this was the meaning of Pitt's words. Even so,\r\nhe should not have divulged anything which took place in his closet,\r\nspecially if it was likely to make mischief; he was, however, in serious\r\ndifficulties. His device succeeded. Though Bedford was already aware\r\nthat Pitt would not act with him, he was piqued at this fresh\r\ndeclaration of hostility; he agreed to take office, and, on September 9,\r\nwas appointed president of the council in succession to Lord Granville\r\nwho died in the previous January. He was considered head of the\r\nadministration. The Earl of Sandwich became secretary of state and took\r\nthe northern department, and Lord Hillsborough succeeded Lord Shelburne\r\nas president of the board of trade. Sandwich had official experience,\r\nand was neither idle nor incapable, though unprincipled and extremely\r\nprofligate; Hillsborough was deficient in tact and judgment. Shelburne\r\nhad been one of Bute's followers, and arranged his bargains with Fox,\r\nwho accused him of having deceived him. He was employed in the late\r\nnegotiations with Pitt, resigned office on their failure, and attached\r\nhimself to Pitt. The king was completely in the hands of Bedford and\r\nGrenville, his only defence against an administration composed of whig\r\nmagnates. They used their power to force him to send Bute out of London.\r\nThis insolent conduct was specially reprehensible in the case of\r\nGrenville, who owed his advancement to Bute's recommendation. Grenville\r\ncontinued to weary the king with interviews; he worried him with his\r\ndisputes with his colleagues, and irritated him beyond endurance by\r\nsuggestions, which were not ill-founded, that he was still under Bute's\r\ninfluence. \"Good God, Mr. Grenville,\" the poor king exclaimed, \"am I to\r\nbe suspected after all I have done?\"\r\n\r\nParliament met on November 15, and the government at once made an attack\r\non Wilkes. In the lords, Sandwich complained of two profane and obscene\r\npieces printed in his private press, _An Essay on Woman_ and a\r\nparaphrase of the _Veni Creator_. There was no evidence of publication;\r\na few copies only were printed, evidently for private circulation, and\r\none of them was obtained by tampering with a workman. Even if\r\npublication had been proved, there would still have been no reason for\r\nthe lords' interference; for obscene and profane publications were\r\npunishable by law. But the ministers were anxious to obtain support for\r\ntheir measures of revenge. The name of Bishop Warburton of Gloucester\r\nwas attached in mockery to notes in the _Essay on Woman_, and with his\r\nconcurrence the case was brought before the house as a breach of\r\nprivilege. The lords lent themselves to this transparent device; they\r\npetitioned the king to command the prosecution of Wilkes and, later,\r\nwhen he was out of their reach, ordered that he should be confined for\r\nhis offence against themselves. Their proceedings excited public\r\nridicule. That Sandwich should complain of obscenity and profanity, and\r\nshould censure Wilkes, a fellow-monk of Dashwood's debauched fraternity,\r\nfor indulging in them was, indeed, a case of Satan rebuking sin. At a\r\nperformance of the \"Beggar's Opera\" at Covent Garden theatre the\r\naudience caught up with delight Macheath's words, \"That Jemmy Twitcher\r\nshould peach me I own surprised me,\" and Sandwich became generally known\r\nas Jemmy Twitcher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WILKES EXPELLED FROM PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nOn the same day as the proceedings in the lords, Grenville brought a\r\nmessage from the king to the commons informing them of what had been\r\ndone in Wilkes's case. They voted, 273 to 111, that the _North Briton_,\r\nNo. 45, was a false and seditious libel, and ordered that it should be\r\nburnt by the common hangman. In the course of the debate, Martin, who\r\nhad lately been secretary to the treasury, called Wilkes a cowardly and\r\nmalignant scoundrel. The next day, the 16th, they fought a duel with\r\npistols in the ring in Hyde Park; they had no seconds and each fired\r\ntwice. Martin's second shot wounded Wilkes dangerously. In his absence\r\nthe commons discussed his plea of privilege. Pitt strongly urged the\r\nhouse to maintain its privileges. Parliament, he said, had no right to\r\nsurrender them; if it did so it would endanger its own freedom and\r\ninfringe upon the rights of the people. As for Wilkes personally, Pitt\r\nwas anxious to show that he did not approve of Temple's support of him,\r\nand called him \"the blasphemer of his God and the libeller of his king\".\r\nThe house voted by 258 to 133 that privilege of parliament does not\r\nextend to seditious libels, and ought not to obstruct the ordinary\r\ncourse of the law in such cases. In itself this was an excellent\r\ndecision. Parliamentary privileges had increased to a mischievous\r\nextent. By the abandonment of many of them, such as certain invidious\r\nexemptions from the course of law which it claimed for its members, the\r\nexclusion of strangers from its debates, and the prohibition of\r\nreporting, parliament has gained in dignity and purity, and has\r\nconfirmed the liberties of the people. Nevertheless, though the\r\nabandonment of privilege was in itself a step in a right direction, it\r\nwas reprehensible in Wilkes's case, because it was an _ex post facto_\r\nmeasure, designed to meet a special case, and vindictive in its\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nThe lords agreed in the decision of the commons, though a protest\r\nagainst the surrender of privilege was signed by seventeen peers. On\r\nDecember 3, the day fixed for the burning of No. 45 in front of the\r\nRoyal Exchange, a large mob broke the windows of the sheriff's coach and\r\npelted the constables. Encouraged by gentlemen at the windows of\r\nneighbouring houses, they tore a large part of the paper from the\r\nexecutioner with shouts of \"Wilkes and liberty,\" carried it in triumph\r\noutside Temple Bar, the boundary of the city, and there made a bonfire\r\ninto which they threw a jack-boot and a petticoat, the popular emblems\r\nof Bute and the Princess of Wales. Yet Wilkes was in an unpleasant\r\nposition. A Scot went to his house intending to murder him; was arrested\r\nand found insane. A summons was sent to him to appear at the bar of the\r\nhouse of commons; his surgeons stated that he was too ill to attend, and\r\na later day was fixed. Before it came he went off secretly to Paris, and\r\nwhile there excused himself from obedience to the order of the house by\r\nsending a medical certificate. The commons refused to give any weight to\r\nit, declared him in contempt, and guilty of a seditious libel, and on\r\nJanuary 19, 1764, expelled him the house. An information was laid\r\nagainst him in the court of king's bench for reprinting and publishing\r\nNo. 45; he was convicted and, as he did not appear to receive sentence,\r\nwas outlawed.\r\n\r\nWhile little sympathy seems to have been felt for Wilkes personally,\r\nexcept among the lower classes, the attack upon him was widely resented\r\nbecause it was regarded as an encroachment on national liberty.\r\nParliament was not in accord with public feeling. A strong effort was\r\nmade to induce the commons to declare that general warrants were\r\nillegal. Pitt acknowledged that he had issued them during the war, when\r\nit was necessary to find out and remove suspected persons; but no such\r\nnecessity existed at present, and he urged the house to do justice to\r\nthe nation, the constitution, and the law, by condemning them. The\r\nministers managed to shelve the question, but carried the adjournment\r\nonly by 234 to 218. Though on other matters they commanded a large\r\nmajority, several members from whom they expected support voted against\r\nthem in the debates arising out of Wilkes's arrest. Among these were\r\nGeneral Conway and Colonel Barre. Conway, the brother of the Earl of\r\nHertford, had gained much credit in the war in Germany; he was a dashing\r\nofficer and a respectable general, a man of refined tastes and high\r\nprinciples. As a politician he was thoroughly honest, of small ability\r\nand utterly wanting in decision of character. He was the dearest friend\r\nof Horace Walpole; and Walpole, who regarded politics in a personal\r\nlight, exercised an unfortunate influence upon him. Barre, who had\r\nserved with distinction in Canada, was a coarse man, eloquent, and\r\nfeared by his opponents on account of his remarkable power of invective.\r\nHe sat for one of Shelburne's boroughs, and believing himself slighted\r\nby Pitt, attacked him vehemently in the house on his resignation of\r\noffice. As a supporter of Bute he was appointed adjutant-general and\r\ngovernor of Stirling, posts worth L4,000 a year. George, who regarded a\r\nvote against the ministers in this matter as a personal affront to\r\nhimself, was determined that all who held either military or civil\r\nappointments should clearly understand that they could not continue to\r\nserve him if they opposed his policy in parliament. With Bedford's\r\napproval, Conway, Barre, and with them General A'Court, who had also\r\nvoted in the minority, were deprived of their commands, and Shelburne,\r\nBarre's patron, was dismissed from his office as aide-de-camp to the\r\nking. Barre followed Shelburne's example in attaching himself to Pitt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GRENVILLE'S ECONOMY._]\r\n\r\nThese dismissals violated the most valuable of the privileges of\r\nparliament, freedom of speech and immunity from royal coercion. It was a\r\nwell-established constitutional rule that the king should not take\r\nnotice of anything which passed in parliament and that no member should\r\nsuffer for his speeches or votes. This rule had been broken in the last\r\nreign when, in 1733, two officers lost their commands and, in 1735, Pitt\r\nhis cornetcy for acting with the opposition. On the present occasion the\r\nresponsibility for its violation rests on Grenville at least as much as\r\non the king himself. Parliament took little notice of this infringement\r\nupon its privileges, though on the first day of the session, 1765,\r\nGranby pleased the army by some sharp remarks on the dismission of\r\nofficers on account of their votes in parliament.[67] Encouraged by\r\ntheir success against Wilkes, the ministers waged war on political\r\nlibels. A large number of _ex officio_ informations, or accusations\r\npresented by the attorney-general on which the person accused was\r\nbrought to trial without the previous finding of a grand jury, were laid\r\nagainst printers and others during the course of the year. As this\r\nlooked like persecution, it excited popular anger. One bookseller who\r\nwas sentenced to stand in the pillory in New-palace-yard, Westminster,\r\ndrove thither in a hackney coach numbered 45, and was cheered by a crowd\r\nestimated at 10,000 persons. Two hundred guineas was collected for him,\r\nand the mob hung a jack-boot and a \"Scotch bonnet\" on a gibbet and then\r\nburnt them.\r\n\r\nGrenville insisted on economy in the national expenditure; it was\r\nneedful, for during the late war the public debt had risen from\r\nL72,500,000 to L132,700,000, and the country was heavily taxed. His\r\nbudget stood in honourable contrast to the finance of the late\r\nadministration; it did not propose lotteries or a private loan, and it\r\nincluded an advantageous bargain with the Bank of England for the\r\nrenewal of its charter. Yet in some matters his economy was\r\nshort-sighted and peddling. He starved the naval estimates. During the\r\nwar many ships were built hastily of timber insufficiently seasoned, and\r\nhad fallen into so bad a condition that half their original cost was\r\nneeded for the repair of their hulls; there were too few workmen in the\r\ndockyards, and the stores were empty of sails, rigging, and cordage.\r\nLord Egmont, the first lord of the admiralty, represented the necessity\r\nfor a large expenditure on the navy, but Grenville would not hear of it.\r\nSo, too, in less important matters, he grudged spending money on the\r\npolice of London, and highway robbery and other crimes of violence were\r\ninsufficiently checked, and he even refused so small a sum as L20,000\r\nwhich the king wanted for the purchase of some land at the back of\r\nBuckingham House, the site of part of the present Grosvenor Place, in\r\norder that the garden which he was then making might not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure on the American colonies and the irregularities by which\r\nthey evaded their legal obligations, were offensive to his frugal and\r\norderly temperament; he proposed to enforce their obligations, and to\r\ndraw from the colonies some part of their cost to the mother-country.\r\nThe colonies occupied a long and comparatively narrow tract of country\r\nstretching for seventeen hundred miles along the Atlantic. They differed\r\nin character. In the northern colonies the puritan element was strong,\r\nand the chief sources of wealth were commerce and farming. The southern\r\ncolonies had cavalier traditions, and their wealth was chiefly derived\r\nfrom plantations which were cultivated by slave labour. Though\r\npuritanism as a religious force was well-nigh extinct in the New England\r\nprovinces, it affected the temper of the people; they set a high value\r\non speech-making and fine words, and were litigious and obstinate;\r\nlawyers were plentiful among them, and had much influence. As a whole\r\nthe colonies were impatient of control and jealous of interference.\r\nTheir constitutions differed in various points; in some the governor was\r\nappointed by the crown, in others by the proprietary. All alike enjoyed\r\na large measure of personal and political freedom: they had the form and\r\nsubstance of the British constitution; they had representative\r\nassemblies in which they taxed themselves for their domestic purposes,\r\nchose most of their own magistrates, and paid them all; and it was\r\nseldom that their legislation was interfered with except with respect to\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESTRICTIONS ON COLONIAL TRADE._]\r\n\r\nThe freedom which they enjoyed did not extend to commerce and\r\nmanufactures. In those matters the policy of Great Britain was founded\r\non the \"mercantile theory,\" then universally accepted, and was directed\r\ntowards securing a monopoly of trade. Other countries pursued a like\r\npolicy towards their colonies, though they treated them with far less\r\nliberality. The restrictions placed by Great Britain on colonial trade\r\nwere based on the Navigation acts of 1660 and later years, which were\r\noriginally aimed at the maritime power of the Dutch. Briefly, they\r\nconfined trade with the colonies to English or colonial ships; the\r\nAmericans were debarred from exporting a number of the most important\r\nproducts of their country, their tobacco, grain, sugar, hides, and\r\ntimber for masts, except to Great Britain; no foreign ship might enter\r\ntheir harbours, nor, with certain exceptions, could they import foreign\r\nmerchandise, except in ships sailing directly from England. Various acts\r\ndebarred them from manufactures which would have entered into\r\ncompetition with English goods; they depended on the mother-country for\r\nthe commonest and most necessary things, for their cloth, hardware, and\r\na host of manufactured articles. Port duties were imposed by England,\r\nand were collected by officers of the customs, whose business it was to\r\nprevent contraband trading. These duties were not imposed for the sake\r\nof revenue, but for the regulation of trade; and the whole system of\r\nrestrictions was founded on the idea that colonies should be made to\r\nserve the interest of the mother-country by giving its merchants and\r\nmanufacturers the monopoly of the colonial market.\r\n\r\nThe colonies received some compensations for the restrictions placed\r\nupon their industry and commerce. With certain exceptions their trade\r\nwas free. While some of their products were confined to the British\r\nmarket, they had the monopoly of that market; no Englishman, for\r\nexample, might buy tobacco which did not come from America or Bermuda.\r\nTheir export trade to England was encouraged by bounties, and, though\r\ntheir foreign imports generally had to come to them through England, a\r\nsystem of drawbacks, by which the duties were remitted on exportation to\r\nAmerica, enabled them to buy continental goods more cheaply than they\r\ncould be bought in England. Nothing indeed can be further from the truth\r\nthan the idea that England's treatment of her colonies was harsh or\r\nilliberal. Unfortunately the mercantile theory set up an opposition\r\nbetween the interests of a mother-country and her colonies. A far more\r\nimportant mitigation of the restrictions imposed on the colonies than\r\nany that came from English liberality, was derived from the constant\r\nviolation of them. Few English statesmen knew or cared to know anything\r\nabout colonial affairs. Left to themselves the American colonies grew\r\nrich. Their merchants, especially in New England, carried on a brisk and\r\nextremely profitable contraband trade. In exchange for lumber, fish, and\r\ncattle the New England merchants obtained sugar and molasses, and\r\nbullion from the French and Spanish colonies; and vast quantities of rum\r\nwere distilled in Boston and exported to Africa to be used in the slave\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nEngland was not altogether a loser by these transactions. The richer a\r\nBoston merchant became, the more British goods did he import, and as he\r\nhad to pay for them in bullion, his contraband trade enabled him to meet\r\nhis obligations. These advantages were indirect, the loss to the English\r\nWest India merchants was obvious and heavy. In order to protect them an\r\nattempt was made in 1733 to stop this contraband trade by the imposition\r\nof heavy duties; but the profits of the trade were so large that the\r\nrevenue officers found it to their interest to be careless or actually\r\nconniving, and scarcely any duties were paid. On an average the American\r\ncustoms cost England from L7,000 to L8,000 a year and did not bring in\r\nquite L2,000. During the war the contraband trade afforded the French\r\nuseful supplies, and in 1760 Pitt ordered the colonial governors to\r\npunish those who traded with the enemy. More power was placed in the\r\nhands of the revenue officers by the issue of writs of assistance\r\nenabling them to search for dutiable articles in any place without\r\nalleging specific information. These writs were lawful and were\r\nspecially justifiable in time of war. Their lawfulness was\r\nunsuccessfully disputed before the superior court of Massachusetts by a\r\nlawyer named Otis, an eloquent speaker, singularly devoid of moderation.\r\nHis speech, in which rhetoric is more conspicuous than a knowledge of\r\nlaw, attacked the commercial legislation of parliament generally; it was\r\nmuch admired, and has been regarded by some Americans as the first step\r\ntowards revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES._]\r\n\r\nA system which cramped the trade and industry of a self-reliant people,\r\ngrowing in wealth and intent on gain, for the benefit of a country\r\nseparated from them by 3,000 miles of ocean, then only crossed by\r\nsailing ships, must sooner or later have led to revolt. The Americans\r\nwere impatient of control and apt to quarrel with their governors, who\r\noften found their office an unenviable one. \"Such wrong-headed people,\"\r\nsaid one of them, \"I thank God I had never to do with before.\" They were\r\nnot a people patiently to submit to restrictions. Two causes had\r\ncontributed to bind them to Great Britain. One of these was their fear\r\nof the French in Canada. So long as the French and their Indian allies\r\nthreatened their homes, even the most turbulent of them knew that they\r\ngained by being subjects of the English king. The war with France called\r\nforth a feeling of loyalty. The triumph of England freed them from the\r\nfear of French aggression and their protestations of gratitude were\r\nexuberant. Yet there were many who saw that the conquest of Canada\r\nloosened the tie which bound the American colonies to the mother-country\r\nand would probably lead to an assertion of independence. Separation\r\nwould, however, have been impossible without union. The jealousies\r\nbetween the colonies were so strong that revolt seemed improbable. Were\r\nthey left to themselves, Otis declared in 1765, \"America would be a mere\r\nshambles of blood and confusion\". A common cause alone could bring about\r\nunion, and such a cause was soon to be found. The termination of the war\r\nenabled the ministers to direct their attention to the contraband trade\r\nwhich had assisted the common enemy, defrauded the government, and\r\nannoyed the commercial class. During Bute's administration, in 1763,\r\nrevenue cutters were sent to cruise off the American coast, the officers\r\nof the king's ships were sworn to act as revenue officers, and revenue\r\ncases were heard in the admiralty courts. Smuggling was more effectually\r\nchecked, and the irritation caused by the loss of trade was aggravated\r\nby the roughness with which the seamen enforced the law.\r\n\r\nGrenville adopted a new policy apparently contemplated by Bute's ministry.\r\nHitherto parliament had imposed customs duties on the colonies solely for\r\nthe purpose of regulating trade; he designed to raise revenue from them.\r\nThe idea was suggested to Walpole as a means of obtaining money on the\r\nfailure of his excise scheme, and that wary statesman promptly rejected\r\nit. The money, however, which Grenville hoped to raise from the colonies\r\nwas not to swell the revenues of England; it was to be applied to their\r\nown defence. His design was reasonable. The war had enormously increased\r\nthe public debt. It is true that it was not undertaken only for the\r\ndefence of the colonies; it is not less true that it was not a merely\r\ninsular war. The war concerned the empire at large, and Great Britain's\r\nlavish sacrifices of blood and treasure delivered her children across the\r\nocean from the fear of French conquest. Her expenditure on their defence\r\ncould not end with the war; a small standing army had to be maintained for\r\ntheir protection. It seemed not unlikely that France would attempt to\r\nregain her lost dominions; it would have been fatal to leave the American\r\ncolonies undefended. And another foe was always at hand, for the Indians\r\nregretted the overthrow of the French and were exasperated by the\r\nill-treatment they received from the British colonists. In 1763 Pontiac,\r\nhead-chief of the Ottawas, formed a confederation against the English.\r\nAlong the borders of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland the Indians\r\nmassacred outlying settlers, surprised many forts and slew their\r\ngarrisons. Three provinces might have been overrun before the inhabitants\r\nhad organised any defence, had not Sir Jeffrey (later Lord) Amherst, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, had a small British force at his disposal, consisting\r\nmainly of companies of the 7th, 42nd, and 77th regiments of the line, and\r\nof the Royal American regiment (later the 60th Rifles), formed in 1755 for\r\nservice in America. A little army composed largely of men of the 42nd\r\nHighlanders, and commanded by Colonel Bouquet, defeated the Indians at\r\nBushy Run on August 5. Fort Pitt was relieved and, the victory having\r\nencouraged the provincials to make a stand, the war virtually ended in\r\nNovember, 1764.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE STAMP ACT PROPOSED._]\r\n\r\nThe provincials disliked the idea of a standing army, and would have\r\npreferred that their defence should have been left to themselves. That\r\nwas impossible. They were largely farmers and traders, peaceful folk\r\nunwilling to leave their profitable pursuits. There was no central\r\nauthority to dictate the proportion of troops which each of the colonies\r\nshould contribute to a common force, and their selfishness and\r\njealousies made them grudge help one to another. The Americans behaved\r\nshabbily to the troops sent to defend them, but Pontiac's war proved\r\nthat in times of pressing danger their safety might depend upon the\r\npresence of a British force. Was it right or just that the colonies\r\nshould be defended by England and should contribute nothing towards the\r\ncost of their defence? Grenville thought that it was not. On March 10,\r\n1764, he laid before parliament a list of port dues; some of them were\r\nhigher than before, and to counterbalance the increase he proposed to\r\ngive several new advantages to colonial trade. Payment was no longer to\r\nbe evaded so easily as in past times, and smuggling would be attended\r\nwith greater risk. The money was to be paid into the English treasury\r\nand was to be used only for colonial defence. More would be wanted for\r\nthat purpose, and he proposed to raise it by an act requiring that all\r\nlegal documents should bear stamps. This measure he deferred for a year\r\nin order to ascertain the feeling of the colonies and to give them an\r\nopportunity of raising the money in some other way if they preferred it.\r\nThe force to be kept in America was twenty regiments, or about 10,000\r\nmen, which, with the maintenance of fortifications, would cost L350,000\r\na year. Of this sum the proposed stamp act would, it was calculated,\r\nbring in about L100,000. The bill passed without remark.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with the agents of the colonies Grenville pointed out\r\nthat the tax was reasonable, and was an easy and equitable way of\r\nraising the required money, but promised that if the colonies disliked\r\nit, and would raise the money themselves in some other way, he would be\r\ncontent. Before the year was out they met him again and, acting on\r\ninstructions from their colonies, tried to dissuade him from his\r\npurpose. Chief among them was Benjamin Franklin, then agent for\r\nPennsylvania, a New Englander by birth, not a puritan either in religion\r\nor morals, a wise politician, shrewd, public-spirited, inventive, and\r\nfull of schemes of practical usefulness. He proposed that the money\r\nshould be voted by the provincial assemblies, but could not say that the\r\ncolonies would agree as to the amount which each should contribute. On\r\nthat of course the whole matter depended. When Grenville brought in his\r\nstamp bill the debate, Burke says, was extremely languid. Parliament had\r\nno idea that the act would lead to serious consequences. Nor were the\r\nAmerican agents much better informed, for Franklin, who considered that\r\na small standing army might be useful, believed that the colonies had no\r\nchoice but to submit to the tax. Pitt was absent from parliament,\r\nsuffering from gout. Conway and Barre opposed the bill, and Barre, in a\r\nspeech of fervid eloquence, described the Americans as \"sons of\r\nliberty,\" driven from their country by tyranny and treated by her with\r\nneglect. In the commons the bill was carried with only forty\r\ndissentients, and in the lords apparently without a division. It\r\nreceived the royal assent on March 22, 1765, and was to come into\r\noperation on November 1. In April the mutiny act was extended to\r\nAmerica, binding the colonies to provide the king's troops with quarters\r\nand certain necessaries, such as fuel and candles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AMERICAN RESISTANCE._]\r\n\r\nThe stamp act raised a storm of indignation in the American colonies.\r\nSome of them, and especially the New England colonies, already had a\r\nsubstantial grievance in the heavy blow dealt to their prosperity by the\r\nrepression of their contraband trade. Their discontent was increased by\r\na suspicion that England was about to establish episcopacy among them at\r\ntheir expense, for Archbishop Secker and other English churchmen were\r\nanxious to introduce bishops into America. A more sentimental, though an\r\nefficient cause of irritation also existed in the affectation of\r\nsuperiority adopted by Englishmen towards their colonial\r\nfellow-subjects. The stamp tax brought their discontent to a head, and\r\ngave the party hostile to government an opportunity for stirring up\r\nopposition. During the year unwisely allowed by Grenville for\r\nconsidering the proposed tax, they busily agitated against it. While at\r\nthat time the Americans allowed that parliament had a right to impose\r\nduties for the regulation of trade, they denied its right to levy an\r\ninternal tax for the purpose of revenue, because they were not\r\nrepresented in parliament.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the ministerial policy naturally began in Boston, where\r\nthe repression of contraband trade weighed most heavily and\r\nwhere--though that was a smaller matter--the dislike to episcopacy was\r\nspecially strong. The town-meeting promptly passed resolutions denying\r\nthe right of parliament to tax the colonies without their consent. The\r\nmeeting was led by Samuel Adams, a man of frugal life and austere\r\ncharacter, who, after failing as a brewer and as a tax collector,\r\nadopted the career most congenial to his tastes and talents of political\r\nagitator. The resolutions were adopted by the provincial assembly, and\r\non its invitation five other colonies joined with Massachusetts in\r\nsending memorials and petitions to England against the proposed tax. The\r\nassembly of Virginia was in session when the news came that the tax was\r\nenacted, and Patrick Henry, a lawyer, brought forward some defiant\r\nresolutions, of which four were carried, though only by a small\r\nmajority. His speech, which contained an insolent reference to the king,\r\nwas much admired. A general congress of the colonies was proposed by\r\nMassachusetts and met at New York on November 7. Representatives of nine\r\ncolonies attended and others sent expressions of good-will. The members\r\ndrew up a statement of their claims and grievances in moderate terms,\r\nand further expressed them in an address to the king, a memorial to the\r\nlords, and a petition to the commons.\r\n\r\nThese orderly proceedings were accompanied by outbursts of lawless\r\nviolence. Societies for resistance were organised. The \"sons of\r\nliberty,\" as they called themselves in reference to Barre's speech, were\r\nactive in Boston, and in August, 1765, a mob plundered the house of a\r\nman who was nominated as a distributor of stamps, destroyed a building\r\non his land which they believed was to be used as a stamp-office, hanged\r\nhim in effigy, and forced him to renounce his appointment. A sermon\r\npreached by Jonathan Mayhew, a popular unitarian minister, on the words\r\n\"I would that they were even cut off which trouble you,\" was followed by\r\na more serious riot. Public buildings were attacked, the records of the\r\nadmiralty court were burnt, and the rioters forced their way into the\r\ncustom-house and got at the liquor in the cellars. Maddened by drink\r\nthey wrecked the stately mansion of Hutchinson, the lieutenant-governor,\r\nand destroyed his fine collection of books and manuscripts. Persons of\r\ngood position more or less openly encouraged these excesses and no one\r\nwas punished for them. Outbreaks of mob violence, though of a less\r\nriotous kind, took place in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and elsewhere. On\r\nNovember 1, the day on which the stamp act came into operation, copies\r\nof it were offered for sale headed, \"The folly of England and the ruin\r\nof America,\" bells were tolled, and mock funerals passed through the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the new stamps were seized and destroyed. At New York the\r\nlieutenant-governor, encouraged by the presence of the king's troops,\r\ntried to secure the stamps sent to the town. A riot ensued. General\r\nGage, the commander-in-chief, declined to interfere at the risk of\r\nbeginning a civil war, and the stamps were surrendered and locked up in\r\nthe town hall. Besides these not a parcel of stamps was left in the\r\ncolonies. For a time this put an end to legal business, and the courts\r\nwere closed. Then lawyers agreed to take no notice of the lack of stamps\r\non documents, and at last the governors declared that the operation of\r\nthe act was to be reckoned as suspended. Retaliatory measures were\r\nconcerted. Merchants combined to stop all importation from England,\r\ncancelled their orders and delayed sending remittances. Associations\r\nwere formed for abandoning the use of English goods, and the richest\r\ncitizens either wore old clothes or rough material of colonial\r\nproduction. Manufactories of linen, cloth, and hardware were started,\r\nand in order to insure a supply of wool, butchers were forbidden by\r\ntheir customers to kill lambs.\r\n\r\nThe distinction made by the party of resistance between external and\r\ninternal taxation was in accordance with previous practice. Though\r\nparliament had frequently imposed port-duties on the colonies, it had\r\nabstained from imposing taxes within them. The stamp act was a new\r\ndeparture. English history afforded ground for the distinction, which\r\nwas alleged in Bate's case, in the reign of James I., in support of the\r\nclaim of the crown. Yet it is clearly artificial, for a division of\r\ntaxes, such as into external and internal, only concerns their\r\nincidence; it is a matter which belongs to economics and does not affect\r\npolitical right. The colonists' claim of exemption from parliamentary\r\ntaxation on the ground of non-representation appeals to the sympathy of\r\nEnglishmen. Both in England and America there were some who desired that\r\nthe colonies should be represented in parliament, but their distance\r\nfrom England and the ignorance of both peoples as regards the\r\ncircumstances and needs of each other would have been fatal objections\r\nto any such scheme. The claim of the colonists seems to imply a\r\nmisapprehension of the character of parliament; for parliament is not a\r\nmere meeting of delegates, it is an imperial assembly, and its\r\nsovereignty is neither derived from the perfection of its constitution\r\nnor lessened by its imperfection. Taxation is an attribute of\r\nsovereignty, and parliament had a right to tax the colonies because the\r\nsovereign power resided in it. Where else could it reside? To deny the\r\nright to tax and to admit the right to legislate was inconsistent. How\r\ncould parliament, in virtue of its sovereign authority, have a right to\r\npass a bill ensuring personal freedom in the colonies, and yet have no\r\nright to pass another bill imposing a tax on them? The logical outcome\r\nof the American contention was that all parliamentary legislation\r\nconcerning the colonies was null, except so far as they chose to admit\r\nit. Under all their arguments lay the germ of independence, though as\r\nyet the leaders of the agitation loudly professed loyalty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _UNSTATESMANLIKE POLICY._]\r\n\r\nThat the tax was reasonable in intention, equitable in incidence, and in\r\nitself tolerable, few probably will now deny. Nor will any one surely\r\ndeny that the act was foolish and unstatesmanlike. Strict definitions of\r\nlegal right are not safe guides in practical politics: sentiment and\r\ncircumstances should be held to be of far greater account. The Americans\r\nmaintained that there was an important difference between external and\r\ninternal taxation, and, in common with all other Englishmen, they highly\r\nvalued the right expressed in the maxim, \"No taxation without\r\nrepresentation\". It was a fatal mistake to disregard their belief and,\r\nfor the sake of avoiding a not very serious expenditure, to seem to deny\r\nwhat they claimed as their heritage as Englishmen. Heavy as its expenses\r\nwere, Great Britain could have afforded to take upon itself the sum\r\nrequired for the defence of the colonies. Grenville could not see the\r\nmatter in this light. Well-meaning and wishing to act fairly both\r\ntowards England and the colonies, he brought trouble on both alike by\r\nhis insistence on legal right. His administration was fruitful in evil.\r\nHe permitted parliament to enter on a disastrous struggle with Wilkes in\r\norder to gratify the king; he raised up discord between England and her\r\nmost important colonies; he allowed the strength of England to decay by\r\ngrudging to spend the money needed for the maintenance of the navy, and\r\nits dignity to be impaired by neglecting to insist on the payment of the\r\nManila ransom, though for that he was not individually responsible. One\r\njudicious act of his administration may be recorded here. The Isle of\r\nMan, though under the allegiance of the king, was not fully under the\r\nroyal authority; the king had no courts and no officers there, and it\r\nwas, as Burke said, \"the very citadel of smuggling\". In 1765 the crown\r\nbought the rights of the Duke and Duchess of Atholl over the island for\r\nL70,000, and it became thenceforward an integral part of the realm of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[65] Hardwicke to Newcastle, Add.

Unlike them, he appears as early as the spring of 1765 to\r\nhave considered the discontent of his American subjects a serious\r\nmatter, and he blamed them for it.[68] In other respects, too, he was\r\ndissatisfied with their public conduct, and he complained bitterly of\r\ntheir behaviour towards himself. In spite of some outward agreement in\r\naction, he and Grenville, who without the name retained nearly all the\r\nauthority of prime minister, pursued fundamentally different systems.\r\nGrenville, though not less ready than the king to meet opposition with\r\nviolent measures, was imbued with whig theories. While George sought to\r\nrule by securing the support of parliament, Grenville tried to use that\r\nsupport to enable him to rule the king. He was a pedant, and lectured\r\nthe king on his duty like a schoolmaster. Bute stood in his way as the\r\nking's ally and secret counsellor. His victory over him was partial and\r\nshort-lived. While Bute was in the country the king corresponded with\r\nhim, and he returned to London in the spring of 1764. His return made\r\nthe ministers uneasy, and Grenville's lectures became intolerable. \"When\r\nhe has wearied me for two hours,\" George complained, \"he looks at his\r\nwatch to see if he may not tire me for an hour more.\" Bad as their\r\npublic conduct was, he and his colleagues owed their fall chiefly to\r\ntheir unbecoming behaviour to their sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE REGENCY BILL._]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1765 the king had a severe illness and showed signs of the\r\ninsanity from which he suffered later. He recovered in March, and as he\r\nbelieved that his life was not likely to be prolonged, he was anxious to\r\nprovide for a possible regency. Constitutional usage pointed to the\r\nqueen as the proper person to be regent during the infancy of her son.\r\nGeorge, however, wished to have the power to nominate a regent by an\r\ninstrument revocable at pleasure. Grenville dissuaded him from this\r\nidea, and, with his ministers' consent, he announced from the throne\r\nthat a bill would be laid before parliament restricting the regency to\r\nthe queen and other members of the royal family usually residing in\r\nEngland. When the bill was proposed in the lords the question was raised\r\nwhether the king's mother was a member of the royal family, or only\r\nthose in the order of succession. If the Princess of Wales became\r\nregent, Bute would probably regain power. In order to prevent this dire\r\npossibility, Bedford sacrificed decency and common sense by successfully\r\nopposing a motion that the princess's name should expressly be included\r\nin the bill. While the matter was pending, on May 3, Halifax and\r\nSandwich went to the king and persuaded him that the bill would not pass\r\nthe commons unless the princess was excluded. Anxious to save his mother\r\nfrom insult, George authorised Halifax to move an amendment that only\r\nthe queen and those descended from George II. should be capable of the\r\nregency. Halifax, in moving the amendment, announced that he did so with\r\nthe king's sanction, and it was adopted by the lords.\r\n\r\nGeorge soon learnt that he had been deceived, that people were\r\nscandalised at his appearing to cast a slur upon his mother, and that\r\nthe opposition in the commons would move to include her name. In great\r\nagitation he appealed to Grenville to help him by announcing a message\r\nfrom the crown to the commons recommending the inclusion of the\r\nprincess. Grenville, though he had had no part in the trick of the two\r\nsecretaries, refused his request on the ground that it would stultify\r\nthe ministers, nor would he give way though the king actually wept with\r\nmortification. An amendment to insert the princess's name was proposed\r\nin the commons, was carried by 167 votes to 37, and was accepted by the\r\nlords. George determined to shake off Grenville's yoke. He called on his\r\nuncle, Cumberland, to find him new ministers, and the duke, though he\r\nhad been treated unkindly by his nephew, loyally came to his help.\r\nEvidently by Bute's advice, the king authorised him to treat with Pitt\r\nand Temple. Pitt was living in retirement, and in October, 1764, told\r\nNewcastle that he intended to remain unconnected. He was willing to\r\naccept office in a comprehensive administration on the understanding\r\nthat the officers who had been dismissed for their votes in parliament\r\nshould be restored, that the new ministers should be at liberty to\r\npropose a resolution declaring general warrants illegal, and that a\r\ncontinental alliance should be formed against the Bourbon powers.\r\n\r\nTemple, however, refused office, and Pitt would not come in without him.\r\nAs Temple was on the eve of a reconciliation with his brother Grenville,\r\nwith whom he had quarrelled over the Wilkes affair, it was thought that\r\nhis refusal was due to an ambitious idea of a family administration of\r\nhimself, his brothers, and Pitt. Be this as it may, he probably\r\nsuspected that Bute would have an influence in the proposed\r\nadministration. Pitt allowed himself to be swayed by gratitude for help\r\nwhich Temple had given him in the days of his poverty. During this\r\nnegotiation a riot broke out in London. The silk manufacture was\r\ndepressed owing to foreign competition, and thousands were consequently\r\nalmost starving. A bill to check the importation of silk by the\r\nimposition of fresh duties was laid before the lords; it was opposed by\r\nBedford, who was averse from restraints on commerce, and it was\r\nrejected. On this a large number of Spitalfields weavers went to\r\nRichmond, on May 14, to seek help from the king in person. They met him\r\non Wimbledon common. He received them kindly, but could not, of course,\r\ngive them the help they wanted. The next day many thousands gathered in\r\nSpitalfields and Moorfields at beat of drum, marched to St. James's and\r\nWestminster, and stopped members on their way to parliament. Bedford was\r\nassaulted and wounded, and on the 17th a determined attack was made upon\r\nhis house on the north side of Bloomsbury Square. It was garrisoned by\r\nsoldiers and others, but the attack was only defeated by the arrival of\r\nfresh troops. When the disturbances were at last quelled, a large\r\ncollection was made for the relief of the immediate distress, which was\r\nfurther mitigated by a sudden fall in the price of bread.[69] The affair\r\nincreased the king's discontent with his ministers and embittered the\r\nfeelings of anger between the Bute and Bedford factions.[70]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE FIRST ROCKINGHAM MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nOn Pitt's refusal to take office, Cumberland tried Lord Lyttelton and\r\nCharles Townshend, but they declined the king's offer because they\r\nbelieved that no strong administration was possible without Pitt. George\r\nwas forced to beg his ministers to continue. They took full advantage of\r\nhis humiliation. Pitt had asked for assurances on matters of public\r\npolicy; they made stipulations which chiefly concerned persons. The king\r\nmust promise never again to consult Bute, and must deprive his brother\r\nMackenzie of the office of privy seal of Scotland. As regards Bute,\r\nGeorge at once gave the required promise, and though he was afterwards\r\nconstantly suspected of consulting with him, there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that he loyally kept his word, and that Bute never again offered\r\nhim any advice.[71] He had promised Mackenzie his office for life, and\r\ndeclared \"that he should disgrace himself\" if he took it from him.\r\nNevertheless Grenville forced him to give way. His relations with his\r\nministers were naturally strained; they complained that he did not\r\nsupport them, and on one occasion Bedford remonstrated with him in\r\ninsolent terms. Again George requested Cumberland to treat with Pitt,\r\nwho had two interviews with the king and was anxious to accept his\r\noffer, but Temple peremptorily refused to take any office, even the\r\ntreasury, and Pitt with deep regret again followed his lead. The king\r\nfound no way of escape, save by authorising Cumberland to turn to the\r\ngreat whig families. Grenville was dismissed, and an administration\r\nformed under the leadership of the Marquis of Rockingham took office on\r\nJuly 16. It must have been a bitter humiliation to George after all that\r\nhad passed. Yet, though for the moment he was defeated, he did not mean\r\nto give over the rule of his kingdom to the whigs, and for the present\r\nanything was better than Grenville's tyranny. George respected his\r\ncharacter, but said he, \"I would rather see the devil in my closet than\r\nMr. Grenville\".\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the Rockingham administration was patent from the first.\r\nCharles Townshend, who succeeded Holland as paymaster, called it \"a\r\nlutestring ministry, fit only for summer wear\"; Pitt was expected to\r\nsupply one of more durable material before the winter. The old phalanx\r\nof the whigs, tried hands at political business, was broken up by death\r\nand desertion; their successors lacked experience and authority.\r\nRockingham, a man of thirty-five, a prominent figure on the turf, of\r\nvast wealth and irreproachable character, was a wretched speaker, and\r\nhad neither genius, knowledge, nor industry. The Duke of Grafton, the\r\nsecretary of state for the northern department, was even younger, and,\r\nlike Rockingham, a great racing man. His public spirit made him a\r\npolitician, but he cared so much more for pleasure than for politics\r\nthat he was apt to be content so long as any immediate difficulty was\r\ntided over, and he suffered in public estimation from the scandal caused\r\nby his dissolute life. The southern department was taken by Conway.\r\nDowdeswell, the chancellor of the exchequer, was a sound financier, but\r\na dull man. Newcastle, who was privy seal and again had charge of church\r\npatronage, was no longer so powerful as in earlier days. Nor were the\r\nministers unanimous in feeling. Grafton was far more at one with Pitt\r\nthan with the Rockingham party; and the chancellor (Henley) Lord\r\nNorthington, Egmont the first lord of the admiralty, and Barrington the\r\nsecretary-at-war were included to please the king. Another cause of\r\nweakness was George's notorious dislike of his new ministers, which\r\nencouraged his \"friends,\" the court party, to intrigue against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT ON COLONIAL TAXATION._]\r\n\r\nMost serious of all was the attitude of Pitt. He was pressed to join the\r\ngovernment; its policy was in many respects such as he could approve,\r\nand in other matters he could almost have made his own terms.\r\nNevertheless he refused to take office and openly declared his lack of\r\nconfidence in the ministers, though they tried to satisfy him in various\r\nways, such as by obtaining a peerage for Pratt, who was created Baron\r\nCamden. Magnificent as he had shown himself as a dictator, he was\r\nunfitted by temperament to work with others, and his natural defects\r\nwere aggravated by his constant attacks of gout. At the same time his\r\npresent attitude was to a large extent also a matter of principle. He\r\nwould willingly have taken office if he could have simply been the\r\nking's minister, unconnected, without belonging to any party. The\r\nRockinghams, as they were called, were a party connexion, and under\r\nRockingham's leadership would remain so, and their character was\r\nemphasised by the inclusion of Newcastle, the chief representative of a\r\nsystem which Pitt hated, government based on the influence of the whig\r\nhouses and not on the good-will of the crown and the people. Pitt\r\nplainly declared that he would not sit at council with Newcastle. Nor\r\nwould he take office under Rockingham. Without him the ministry had\r\nneither an original policy nor a chance of permanence. Called into\r\nexistence by Cumberland, it leant on him for support; he was present at\r\nall cabinet meetings, and they were sometimes held at his house. His\r\nsudden death on October 31 was a severe shock to the stability of the\r\ngovernment. Pitt would not advise the ministers. Grafton urged that he\r\nshould again be invited to take office, but the king would not enter on\r\na fresh negotiation with him, for he had refused his former overtures\r\nand held very different views from his regarding the American stamp act.\r\n\r\nFor months the ministers paid no heed to American discontent, save that\r\nConway wrote rather feebly to some of the colonial governors with\r\nreference to the disorders. Parliament was not summoned until December\r\n17, and though the king's speech directed attention to the late\r\noccurrences in the colonies, the ministers had not decided on a policy.\r\nThey ascertained Pitt's opinion, and so gained a lead. When parliament\r\nassembled in January, 1766, after the recess, Pitt spoke warmly against\r\nany attempt to enforce the stamp act. He avowed his distrust of the\r\ngovernment in a characteristic fashion: \"Pardon me, gentlemen,\" said he,\r\nbowing towards the ministers, \"confidence is a plant of slow growth in\r\nan aged bosom; youth is the season of credulity\". He thought that he saw\r\n\"traces of an overruling influence,\" a dark saying which probably\r\nreferred to Newcastle.[72] While he asserted the sovereignty of Great\r\nBritain over the colonies in legislation, he maintained that parliament\r\nhad no right to tax them; taxation, according to him, was \"no part of\r\nthe governing or legislative power\". He regarded the tax as an\r\ninfringement of constitutional liberty, and rejoiced that the Americans\r\nhad resisted it. Such a matter, he urged, was not to be decided by\r\ntext-books; he had not come down to the house \"armed with the\r\nstatute-book, doubled down with dog's-ears, to defend the cause of\r\nliberty\". America might be crushed, but if she fell, she would fall like\r\nSamson, embracing and pulling down the pillars of the state, the\r\nconstitution, along with her. Let them bind her commerce and restrict\r\nher manufactures, but abstain from demanding money without the consent\r\nof her people. His words had a great effect; they put enforcement out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nA few days later Edmund Burke made his first speech in parliament,\r\nrecommending the house to receive a petition from the colonies, and was\r\nat once recognised as a new power. He was an Irishman, and was already\r\nknown as a writer. He became Rockingham's secretary in 1765, and a seat\r\nwas provided for him. Unsurpassed in his mastery of English prose, he\r\nexhibits to the full the splendour of the English language in his\r\nspeeches and pamphlets. Nor is his thought unworthy of the gorgeous\r\nattire with which it is invested. His power and constant habit of\r\ndiscerning and expounding the principles which were involved in\r\nquestions of the moment, give him a supreme place as a teacher of\r\npolitical wisdom. In character he was pure, generous, and\r\ntender-hearted. His fervid imagination extended the area of his\r\nsympathies, and sometimes prejudiced his opinions. As a speaker he was\r\neloquent, and now and again carried his audience completely with him,\r\nbut he never caught the tone of the house of commons; his longer\r\nspeeches were too much of the nature of exhaustive treatises to be\r\nacceptable to its members; he had little tact, an impatient temper, and\r\noften spoke with execrable taste. The chief article in his political\r\ncreed was his belief in the excellence of the constitution. He was an\r\nardent reformer of abuses, but with the constitution itself he would\r\nhave no meddling. Unlike Pitt, he saw that the only effectual check to\r\ncorrupt influence was to be found in government by a party united for\r\nthe promotion of national interests upon some common principle. Such a\r\nparty might, he believed, be based on the whig families, if only they\r\nwould keep themselves free from court intrigue and selfish jealousies.\r\nHe was a whig of a different type from Newcastle and Bedford; he built\r\nhis hopes on the Rockinghams and inspired their policy. That he never\r\nsat in a cabinet was chiefly because in those days such a distinction\r\nwas confined to men of higher birth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPEAL OF THE STAMP ACT._]\r\n\r\nDecided action with regard to America was a pressing necessity. The\r\nmeasures of retaliation adopted by the colonists were depressing trade\r\nat home. Petitions against the stamp act were presented from the\r\nmerchants of London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and other towns, setting forth\r\nthe loss inflicted on manufacturers and their work-people by the\r\nstoppage of the American trade, and the difficulties arising from the\r\nnon-payment of debts due from America, which amounted to L4,000,000. The\r\nministers resolved on the repeal of the act, and on a bill declaring the\r\nright of parliament to legislate for the colonies on all matters\r\nwhatsoever. Some of the king's household having voted against the\r\ngovernment, Rockingham went to the king to remonstrate with him. George\r\ntold him that he was for repeal, and that Rockingham might say so. Two\r\ndays later the ministers heard that Lord Strange, one of the court\r\nparty, was saying that the king was against repeal, and wished it to be\r\nknown. This made a great stir, and the \"ministerial lives were thought\r\nnot worth three days' purchase\". Rockingham went to the king for an\r\nexplanation. George acknowledged that he had told him that he was for\r\nrepeal, but said that they had been speaking only of the choice between\r\nthe repeal and the enforcement of the act, that of the two he was for\r\nrepeal, but that he desired that the act should be modified and not\r\nrepealed. The ministers had therefore \"to carry on a great public\r\nmeasure against the king's declared sentiments, and with a great number\r\nof his servants acting against them\".[73] Nevertheless the bill for the\r\nrepeal of the act was carried in the commons on March 11 by 275 votes to\r\n167, and a week later in the lords by 105 to 71. It was a signal\r\nvictory; but, apart from the interests of commerce, it was due rather to\r\nPitt than to the government. The declaratory bill also passed; its chief\r\nopponents being Pitt and, in the upper house, Lord Camden, who on this\r\nquestion, as well as on that of repeal, talked much trash about a\r\nfundamental law of nature and the limits of the power of parliament,\r\nmore in place in the mouth of an American demagogue than of an English\r\njudge. An address was also carried recommending that the colonial\r\ngovernors should be instructed to require compensation to be made to\r\nthose who had suffered during the late disturbances.\r\n\r\nBoth in England and America the repeal of the stamp act was hailed with\r\nrejoicing. American discontent was hushed, and the public manifestations\r\nof gladness were accompanied by expressions of loyalty and affection for\r\nthe mother-country. The colonists, however, knew that they had won a\r\nvictory over parliament, and they did not forget it. Their substantial\r\ngrievance, the commercial regulations, still remained; they soon saw\r\nthat they must go further, and that Pitt's distinction between a direct\r\nmoney-tax and duties on merchandise, though it had served their\r\nimmediate purpose, would no longer be useful. The declaratory act was\r\nregarded as a menace, and kept alive their feelings of suspicion and\r\nirritation. Their temper was shown by the delay of many of the colonies\r\nto vote the required compensation. In Massachusetts, where the vote was\r\npassed in December, it was insolently accompanied by a vote of indemnity\r\nto all concerned in the riots. The repeal of the stamp act needs no\r\ndefence; a mistake had been made which was leading to serious\r\nconsequences, and in such a case it is a statesmanlike policy to retrace\r\nthe false step. The declaratory act was passed to save the dignity of\r\nparliament. In spite of Burke's admiration for this act, it may be\r\nsuggested that the assertion of a right by a party which at the same\r\ntime declines to enforce it, is neither a dignified nor a wise\r\nproceeding. Its only, and sufficient defence is that without it the\r\nrepeal of the tax would have been impossible. The Americans' denial of\r\nthe right of parliament, accompanied as it was by violence of word and\r\naction, roused much indignation in England and involved every supporter\r\nof the repeal in the imputation of betraying its dignity. If repeal was\r\nto be carried it was necessary to satisfy men's minds by a declaration\r\nof the right of parliament to tax the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CHATHAM MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nSome good work was done in other directions; the cider-tax was repealed,\r\na commercial treaty was made with Russia, and the house of commons came\r\ninto agreement with the judges on the question of general warrants by\r\nresolving that general warrants being illegal, except in the cases\r\nprovided for by act of parliament, the arrest of any of its members on\r\nsuch a warrant would be a breach of privilege. The administration,\r\nhowever, was enfeebled by the unconcealed dislike of the king, the\r\nhostility of Pitt, and the general belief that it was keeping him out of\r\noffice. Pitt was extremely anxious for office, but would not accept it\r\nunless a \"transposition of offices\" was made; unless, in fact,\r\nRockingham was got rid of. To this Rockingham would not consent; he\r\nwanted Pitt to take office as his ally, not as his successor. There were\r\ndifferences in the cabinet on the matter. The king's section wished to\r\ngain Pitt for their master; Rockingham was upheld by his friends;\r\nGrafton wanted Pitt as prime minister, and Conway, though less decided,\r\nagreed with him. Pitt became querulous and unreasonable, and in April\r\nviolently attacked the ministers, specially excepting Grafton and\r\nConway.[74] All attempts at negotiation having failed, Grafton made his\r\nchoice for Pitt and resigned office. It was not easy to fill his place,\r\nfor the ministry was regarded as moribund, and finally the king was\r\nforced to give the seals to Rockingham's friend, the young Duke of\r\nRichmond. The chancellor, Northington, a strong supporter of the king,\r\nsaw that the end was not far off, and apparently determined to make sure\r\nof a place in the next administration by sacrificing his colleagues. He\r\nquarrelled with them in the cabinet on a question relating to the\r\nadministration of law in Canada, and early in July told the king that he\r\nmust resign office, and that the ministry was too weak to go on. George\r\neagerly seized the opportunity for getting rid of it and replacing it by\r\na more comprehensive ministry with Pitt at its head. The difficulties\r\nwhich had stood in Pitt's way were removed; the American question seemed\r\nto be settled; he had made it known that he would not again be guided by\r\nTemple, and he was delighted to be the king's minister, avowing his\r\ndetermination \"to defend the closet against every contending\r\nparty\"--against, that is, the great whig houses and their connexions.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction consequent on Pitt's accession to power faded at the\r\nnews that he had accepted a peerage as Earl of Chatham. It was unjustly\r\nconsidered as a bribe, and lost him much of his popularity. A more\r\nserious consequence was that it left the leadership of the house of\r\ncommons to weaker hands. Though prime minister, he took for himself the\r\nunimportant office of privy seal. His course was probably determined by\r\na consciousness of failing health. Conway became northern secretary of\r\nstate, with the leadership of the commons, and Shelburne secretary for\r\nthe southern department. In spite of Temple's opposition to the repeal\r\nof the stamp act, Pitt offered him the treasury, but that vain man\r\nwould not enter the cabinet except as Pitt's equal, and a quarrel ensued\r\nbetween them. The treasury was then accepted by Grafton; and,\r\nunfortunately, by his advice, Charles Townshend was made chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer. Camden was appointed chancellor, Northington president of\r\nthe council, and they, with Granby as commander-in-chief, and Sir\r\nCharles Saunders, who succeeded Egmont at the admiralty, completed the\r\ncabinet. Besides Conway and Saunders, some other Rockinghams had\r\ninferior offices, but Rockingham himself and most of his party\r\nconsidered that Chatham had treated them badly, and repelled his\r\nadvances. The ministry was unfortunate in being represented in the house\r\nof commons by the irresolute Conway and the unprincipled Townshend.\r\nWorse still, Chatham, whose arrogance increased with his disease,\r\nalienated adherents, and treated his colleagues with reserve and\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\nChatham at once pursued the foreign policy which he had consistently\r\nrecommended by seeking a continental alliance to counterbalance the\r\nalliance of the Bourbon powers. The family compact did not lose its\r\nimportance at the peace of Paris. Choiseul in France and Grimaldi, who\r\nsucceeded Wall in Spain, worked together heartily in promoting a Bourbon\r\npolicy, and looked forward to the reconquest of the lost possessions of\r\nFrance and Spain. The allies were strengthened by the good-will of\r\nAustria. Schemes of aggrandisement were formed, which included the\r\nacquisition of Corsica by France and of Portugal by Spain. There were\r\nunsettled causes of dispute between them and England touching the\r\nfortification of Dunkirk and the Manila ransom, and Spain was also\r\naggrieved by a British settlement in the Falkland islands. Against\r\nFrance the natural ally of England was Russia, for she had a strong\r\ninterest in opposing French influence in Denmark and Sweden; while on\r\nthe side of England a Russian alliance would, in the event of war,\r\nsecure her Baltic trade and enable her fleet to act elsewhere, and would\r\nbe a defence for Hanover. An alliance with Russia had already been\r\ndiscussed, but Catherine II. had far less interest in the matter than\r\nEngland, and insisted that any alliance should include her Turkish war,\r\nto which England would not consent. Catherine was in alliance with\r\nFrederick of Prussia, and Chatham, hoping that the adhesion of England\r\nwould be welcomed, designed a defensive alliance between Great Britain,\r\nPrussia, and Russia, which might take in Denmark, Sweden, the\r\nStates-General, and any other power interested in withstanding Bourbon\r\naggrandisement. To Catherine her alliance with Prussia was much more\r\nimportant than anything which she could obtain from England, and\r\nChatham's design therefore depended on Frederick's good-will. He\r\ndeclined the proposal of Great Britain: he had not forgiven the\r\nill-treatment which he believed he had received from Bute; he admired\r\nChatham, but had no assurance that he would remain in power; and he\r\nconsidered any possible danger to himself from the Bourbon alliance to\r\nbe too remote to make it advisable for him to join in a concert to\r\nprevent it. He was already meditating the partition of Poland, and the\r\nproposed combination would have been contrary to his policy. Chatham's\r\ngreat design was consequently defeated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHATHAM'S DIFFICULTIES._]\r\n\r\nHis arbitrary temper soon brought him into difficulties. He desired to\r\nreward a new adherent with the office of treasurer of the household,\r\nthen held by Lord Edgcumbe, and on Edgcumbe's refusal to vacate the\r\noffice, he deprived him of it. Edgcumbe was connected with the\r\nRockingham party, and, with the exception of Conway, all the more\r\nimportant members of it who had joined the new ministry, the Duke of\r\nPortland, Saunders, and others, resigned office. Conway was almost\r\npersuaded to follow their example, for Chatham treated him with haughty\r\ncoldness, but he yielded to the urgent advice of his friend Horace\r\nWalpole, and remained in the ministry, uneasy and vacillating. Any\r\nalliance with the Rockinghams being out of the question, Chatham was\r\ndriven to make overtures to the Bedford party, which failed because they\r\nasked more than he would grant. Finally, Saunders's place at the\r\nadmiralty was supplied by the famous admiral, Sir Edward Hawke, and the\r\nother vacancies were filled by tories and courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe harvest of 1765 was bad, and that of the present year promised to be\r\nno better. The price of wheat rose rapidly, and in July reached 44s. a\r\nquarter. The poor were distressed, worse times seemed to be ahead, and\r\nthe dealers were believed to be keeping back supplies in the expectation\r\nof higher prices. Riots of a more or less serious character broke out in\r\nsome fifty places; bakers' shops were pillaged, mills and barns were\r\nfired, and dealers and tradesmen were forced to sell provisions at\r\nprices fixed by the people. It was not until September 10, when wheat\r\nhad again risen, that the ministers, in accordance with the economic\r\nideas of the time, issued a proclamation against forestalling and\r\nengrossing. It had no effect; the price reached 49s., and on the 26th\r\nthe council laid an embargo on exportation. By law the ministers had no\r\nright to take such a step until wheat was at 53s. 4d. As, however,\r\nprices were rising, all parties agreed that the embargo was in itself a\r\njustifiable measure. It was, however, objected that the ministers should\r\nhave summoned parliament to meet at an earlier date, and have acted with\r\nits authority. When parliament met on November 11, the opposition\r\ninsisted that the ministers needed a bill of indemnity for having set\r\naside the law by a proclamation of council. Chatham defended their\r\naction on the constitutional ground of necessity. His colleagues and\r\nsupporters were not all equally wise. Northington declared that the\r\nproclamation was legally, as well as morally, justifiable; and the\r\nchancellor, Camden, the assertor of popular liberties, that \"it was at\r\nmost a forty days' tyranny\". His foolish speech was severely handled by\r\nMansfield. In the commons Alderman Beckford, a hot-headed admirer of\r\nChatham, said that \"if the public was in danger the king had a\r\ndispensing power,\" and was forced by Grenville to retract his words. The\r\ndebates on this matter injured the reputation of the ministry though\r\nthey did not endanger its stability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REVOLT IN BENGAL._]\r\n\r\nWhen parliament rose in December Chatham went to Bath for the sake of\r\nhis health. In February, 1767, he had a severe attack of gout, and in\r\nMarch the disease began to affect his mental powers. For the next two\r\nyears he was unable to take any part in politics. His effacement left\r\nthe ministry without a head. Before his retirement a difference arose in\r\nthe cabinet on the affairs of the East India Company. From a simple\r\ntrading company it had been raised by the victories of Clive and his\r\ngenerals to the position of a territorial power. Its affairs were\r\nmanaged by a court of directors elected annually, and consequently under\r\nthe control of the court of proprietors in which every holder of L500\r\nstock had a vote. It proved itself unequal to its new position. Clive\r\nreturned to England in 1760, the possessor of a princely fortune, and in\r\n1762 was created Baron Clive of Plassey in the Irish peerage. He was\r\nopposed in the court of directors by a party headed by Sullivan. In\r\nIndia he was succeeded by Vansittart, and there troubles soon arose,\r\nchiefly from the greed of the company's servants. Mir Jafar, the Nawab\r\nof Bengal, a self-indulgent and unpopular ruler, was deposed by the\r\ncouncil in 1761, and his son-in-law, Mir Kasim, was made nawab in his\r\nplace. It was a profitable business, for Mir Kasim spent L200,000 in\r\npresents to the council and ceded to the company the revenues of three\r\ndistricts, amounting to some L500,000 a year. Yet the exchange of nawabs\r\nproved an unwise step, for Mir Kasim was able and active. He moved his\r\ncourt from Murshidabad to Monghyr, at a greater distance from Calcutta,\r\norganised an army, and showed that he was ready to resist oppression.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Indian princes were largely derived from tolls on\r\nthe transit of merchandise. The company, which had the right of free\r\nexportation and importation, passed its goods free inland under the\r\ncertificate of the head of a factory. The system was abused. The company\r\npaid its servants insufficient salaries, and they made up for it by\r\nengaging in private inland trade, using the company's passes to cover\r\ntheir goods. Armed with its power, they forced the natives to deal with\r\ntheir native agents, to buy dear and sell cheap; they monopolised the\r\ntrade in the necessaries of life, and grew rich upon the miseries of the\r\nhelpless people. Private trade and extorted presents enabled many a man\r\nwho as a mere youth had obtained a writer's place to return to England\r\nafter a few years with a handsome income. Mir Kasim saw his people\r\nstarving, his officers ill-treated, and his treasury robbed, and\r\nprepared for revolt. Conscious of the impending danger, Vansittart made\r\nan agreement with him as to tolls. The council at Calcutta indignantly\r\nrepudiated the agreement, and Mir Kasim was furious. Open hostilities\r\nbegan in June, 1763. One of the council, who was sent on an embassy to\r\nKasim, was killed by his troops. Patna was seized by the English; it was\r\nretaken, and some 200 English were made prisoners. A little army under\r\nMajor Adams, routed the nawab's forces, and on October 11 Monghyr was\r\ntaken. Mir Kasim caused all his prisoners, save five, to be massacred,\r\nand fled for refuge to Shuja-ud-Daula the nawab wazir of Oudh. Patna was\r\ntaken by storm and Bengal was completely subdued.\r\n\r\nMir Jafar was again made nawab, and paid large sums both to the company\r\nand its servants as compensation for their losses. The war, however, was\r\nnot over, for the nawab wazir espoused the cause of Mir Kasim, and, in\r\nconjunction with the Mughal emperor, Shah Alam, threatened Bengal. Major\r\nHector Munro took command of the British army, and found it in a\r\nmutinous condition; desertions to the enemy were frequent. He captured a\r\nlarge body of deserters, caused twenty-four of the ringleaders to be\r\nblown from guns, and by his dauntless conduct restored discipline among\r\nthe troops. With about 7,000 men, of whom only some 1,000 were\r\nEuropeans, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the allied forces, 50,000\r\nstrong, at Baxar on October 23, 1764. The enemy lost 6,000 men and 167\r\nguns. Oudh lay at the disposal of the English, and Shah Alam sought\r\nrefuge with the conquerors. Early in 1765 Mir Jafar died, and the\r\ncouncil at Calcutta, without consulting the emperor, appointed his son\r\nto succeed him, receiving in presents from him L139,357, besides money\r\nunaccounted for. These revolutions and wars cost the company much money,\r\nand, while its servants were enriching themselves, it incurred heavy\r\ndebts. Clive was called upon to put an end to the maladministration of\r\nBengal. He refused to return to India while Sullivan was chairman of the\r\ncourt of directors. After a sharp contest, in which large sums were\r\nspent, the proprietors put his party in power. He was invested with full\r\nauthority as commander-in-chief and governor of Bengal to act in\r\nconjunction with a select committee.\r\n\r\nHe landed in India in May, 1765. During his administration of about\r\neighteen months he secured for the company the virtual sovereignty over\r\nits conquests without dispossessing the nominal rulers, and he took\r\nmeasures for the reformation of the company's service. Averse from a\r\nforward policy of conquest, he restored Oudh to the nawab wazir on\r\npayment of L500,000. Allahabad and Kora were assigned to the emperor,\r\ntogether with a tribute from Bengal, and in return Shah Alam granted to\r\nthe company the right of levying and administering the revenues of\r\nBengal, Behar, and Orissa, together with jurisdiction in the Northern\r\nCircars. The nawab of Bengal received an annual pension of L600,000, and\r\nsurrendered all his power to the company, except the right of criminal\r\njurisdiction. Clive reorganised the army, and stopped the double\r\n_batta_, or allowance, granted by Mir Jafar after the battle of Plassey.\r\nHe forbade illicit trade and the receipt of presents, and secured the\r\ncompany's servants increased salaries. These reforms were effected in\r\nthe face of violent opposition, both in civil and military quarters. Two\r\nhundred officers conspired to resign their commissions on the same day.\r\nClive faced the mutiny successfully; he cashiered the leaders and\r\naccepted the submission of the younger men. Ill-health obliged him to\r\nreturn to England in January, 1767.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AFFAIRS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY._]\r\n\r\nThe enormous private fortunes made in India led people to believe that\r\nthe company was far richer than it really was. During the late wars the\r\ndividend was 6 per cent. In 1766 the proprietors urged an increase. To\r\nthis the directors objected that the debts of the company were heavy,\r\nand that a premature increase would raise the price of stock to a point\r\nat which it could not be maintained, and might end in a disaster like\r\nthat of the South Sea Company. The ministers sent a message of warning,\r\nannouncing that the affairs of the company would probably be considered\r\nin parliament. They concerned the public, for the company enjoyed\r\nprotection and privileges granted by the nation. Nevertheless the\r\nproprietors carried their point, and a dividend of 10 per cent. was\r\ndeclared. Chatham held that the time had come for parliament to inquire\r\nby what right the company administered its territorial revenues. He\r\nconsidered that it had no right to its new position of a virtually\r\nsovereign power, that the sovereignty of the crown should be asserted,\r\nand that in return for the privileges which it enjoyed it should\r\ncontribute a portion of its revenues to the national treasury. The\r\ncompany should apply to parliament to make good its defective title, and\r\nparliament should then settle what portion of its revenues should be\r\nassigned to it by way of favour. His ideas were based on an imperial\r\npolicy. As early as 1759 he held that the territorial acquisitions of\r\nthe company should be claimed for the nation. With him it was a matter\r\nnot merely of revenue but of government, and though his ideas are\r\nindistinctly indicated, and were perhaps vaguely formed, it is probable\r\nthat he had in his mind some idea of making the government of India an\r\nimperial matter. Yet, sharing as he did the general belief as to the\r\nwealth of the company, he certainly attached much importance to the\r\npossibility of obtaining from it an increase of the public revenue.\r\n\r\nA special reason may be discerned for his desire to obtain such an\r\nincrease at the end of 1766. The government wanted money; there was a\r\nheavy debt on the civil list, and the navy needed a large grant. An\r\nincrease of taxation was inadvisable, for corn was dear. Various schemes\r\nfor the increase of revenue were in the air. Many members of parliament,\r\nthe court party, the country interest, and the Grenville and Bedford\r\nconnexions were regretting the repeal of the stamp act. \"We must look to\r\nthe East and not to the West,\" wrote Beckford to Chatham,[75] and he\r\nspoke the mind of his leader. The cabinet was divided. Grafton and\r\nShelburne agreed with Chatham that the question of the company's rights\r\nshould be decided by parliament. Townshend declared that it would be\r\n\"absurd\" to force the company to share its power with the crown, and\r\nboth he and Conway desired that the question of right should be waived\r\nand that its relations with the government should be settled by amicable\r\narrangement. In May, 1767, the proprietors insisted on a dividend at the\r\nrate of 12-1/2 per cent. A motion was carried to bring the affairs of\r\nthe company before parliament. Townshend, as Chatham said, \"marred the\r\nbusiness\"; he managed to open the door for negotiation, and to make it a\r\nmere matter of money. In June, 1767, a bill was passed, based on an\r\nagreement with the company, which in return for the confirmation of its\r\nterritorial revenues, bound itself to pay the government L400,000 a year\r\nfor two years; and parliament prohibited a higher dividend than 10 per\r\ncent. The bill was violently opposed, specially by the Rockingham party,\r\non the ground that it was an unjustifiable interference with the rights\r\nof property. In 1769 the agreement with the company was renewed, and\r\npermission was given for a dividend of 12-1/2 per cent, on certain\r\nconditions. The company was then in debt over L6,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HAIDAR ALI._]\r\n\r\nA new and formidable enemy had arisen in Southern India. In 1767 Haidar\r\n(Hyder) Ali, the ruler of Mysore, made war upon the English in\r\nconjunction with the Nizam of Haidarabad. The allies were defeated, and\r\nthe nizam made peace. Haidar, however, continued the war. He had a large\r\nforce of cavalry which he brought to great perfection, and, as the\r\nEnglish were deficient in that arm, he was able to do much mischief in\r\nthe Karnatic. In April, 1769, having previously drawn the English army\r\naway from Madras by skilful manoeuvres, he suddenly appeared in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the town. The English were forced to make a\r\ntreaty with him on his own terms. The news sent the company's stock down\r\n60 per cent. The same year the crops failed in Bengal, and in 1770 there\r\nwas a grievous famine which is said to have carried off a third of the\r\ninhabitants. Yet in spite of the decreasing revenue and the heavy debts\r\nof the company, the proprietors were receiving dividends of 12 and\r\n12-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] _Newcastle's Narrative_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[69] _Annual Register_, viii.

His brilliant wit and oratory\r\ngave him extraordinary influence in the house of commons, which he used\r\nmerely for his own ends, for he was unprincipled and greedy for\r\npopularity. Whatever it might be that the majority in the house wished\r\nto have done, he was anxious to be the doer of it. This desire to lead\r\nthe house by carrying out its wishes was probably the true reason of his\r\nopposition to Chatham's Indian policy. It led him to take a more\r\ndisastrous line with reference to America. The colonies were irritated\r\nand suspicious. Massachusetts was encroaching on the royal prerogative\r\nby passing an amnesty bill, and was quarrelling over it with its\r\ngovernor, Bernard, and the New York assembly was defying the authority\r\nof parliament by refusing to provide the troops with certain articles\r\nspecified in the mutiny act. An equally unconciliatory spirit prevailed\r\nin England, where the repeal of the stamp act had become unpopular. It\r\nwas necessary to keep a permanent force in America, and the colonists\r\nshould have been willing to contribute to the defence of the empire by\r\npaying for it. Their refusal was attributed to a desire to save their\r\npockets, which to some extent was the case, and Englishmen were angry at\r\nthe prospect of being called upon to meet expenses which should have\r\nbeen borne by others. Even warm friends of the colonies held that a\r\nmilitary establishment should be paid for out of colonial revenues, and\r\nShelburne was considering how a fund might be raised without\r\ntaxation.[76] Unfortunately, Townshend chose to pander to the feelings\r\nof the majority of the commons. In a debate on the army supplies on\r\nJanuary 26, 1767, he boasted, without any previous consultation with his\r\nfellow-ministers, that he could raise a revenue from America nearly\r\nsufficient to maintain the troops there. The house received his words\r\nwith applause, his colleagues with dumb dismay. Grenville and Lord\r\nGeorge Sackville took them up and forced him to pledge himself to make\r\nthem good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AMERICAN REVENUE ACTS._]\r\n\r\nMoney was wanted for the service of the country, and specially for the\r\nmaintenance of the navy, and a month later Townshend proposed that the\r\nland tax should be continued at four shillings in the pound. A strong\r\nopposition was expected, for the country gentlemen reasonably contended\r\nthat the tax had been raised from three to four shillings as a war-tax,\r\nthat it was time to lower it, and that if the stamp act had not been\r\nrepealed it might be reduced to its normal amount.[77] The whigs, whose\r\neconomic policy was directed by their desire to increase the wealth and\r\npower of the nation by promoting trade, held that the larger share of\r\ntaxation should be drawn from the land, and fostered the agricultural\r\ninterest in order to enable it to bear the disproportionate burden they\r\nlaid upon it. Nevertheless, the Rockingham and Grenville parties took\r\nadvantage of the dissatisfaction of the landed gentry, acted together in\r\na factious spirit, and defeated the government proposal by 206 votes to\r\n188. This was a serious blow to the government, and was the first\r\noccasion on which a minister had been defeated on a money-bill since the\r\nrevolution. The defeat was due to Townshend's neglect. Chatham would no\r\nlonger bear with him, and one of his last acts before his retirement was\r\nto invite Lord North, the eldest son of the Earl of Guilford, to take\r\nhis place as chancellor of the exchequer. North refused, and Townshend\r\nremained in office. He had to raise money somehow, and he was kept in\r\nmind of his pledge with regard to America; for parliament was indignant\r\nat the conduct of the New York assembly, and the court party urged him\r\non by representing that the king was humiliated by the repeal of the\r\nstamp act. In June he carried two bills affecting the colonies, one\r\nproviding for the execution of the trade laws, the other imposing duties\r\non the importation of glass, paper, paints, and tea. The produce of\r\nthese duties was to be applied, first, to the cost of administering\r\njustice and of the civil government, and the surplus was to be paid into\r\nthe exchequer and appropriated by parliament to the defence of the\r\ncolonies. The bills passed without opposition and the acts came into\r\noperation on November 20. A bill was also passed suspending the\r\nlegislative power of the New York assembly, until it should comply with\r\nthe mutiny act.\r\n\r\nThe new duties were external taxes, taxes on trade, such as the\r\ncolonists had professed themselves prepared to pay, and they were\r\ntrifling in amount, their produce being estimated at less than L40,000.\r\nBut they were imposed for purposes of revenue, not for the regulation of\r\ntrade, which would in Chatham's eyes have rendered them a rightful\r\nimposition. And the colonists' position had changed. They demanded to be\r\ntaxed only by their own assemblies, and regarded the new acts as laying\r\nthe foundation of a fiscal system which would probably be as liable to\r\nabuse as the Irish civil list. A renewal of the rumour concerning a\r\ncolonial episcopate increased their suspicion as to the height to which\r\ndemands on their purse might grow. Their discontent was originally\r\nfounded on their impatience of control and on the restraints placed upon\r\ntheir industry and commerce; their resistance was roused by the fear of\r\nfuture ill-government rather than by actual grievances. The quarrel\r\nbecame embittered by faults on both sides. By denying the authority of\r\nparliament and contemning the prerogative, the Americans took up a\r\nposition which could not be conceded to them without national\r\nhumiliation; they irritated the English by violent words and actions,\r\nand treated the loyalists with injustice and cruelty. On the other hand,\r\nEngland, besides imposing restrictions on their industry and commerce,\r\nmade demands upon them which, though just, were galling to their spirit.\r\nAs they had representative assemblies, they argued that they should be\r\ntaxed only by their authority. The king and the nation generally had no\r\nsympathy with their complaints and were unconciliatory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHATHAM'S ILLNESS._]\r\n\r\nYet while there were faults on both sides, both alike showed a spirit\r\nworthy of their common stock, the colonists by their insistence on\r\nself-government, the mother-country by its steadfast adherence to the\r\nimperial idea as it then existed. Massachusetts again took the lead in\r\nresistance; the merchants renewed the non-importation agreements, and\r\nthe assembly sent a petition to the king, and on February 11, 1768, a\r\ncircular letter to the other provincial assemblies condemning the late\r\nacts and inviting co-operation. This letter, the work of Samuel Adams,\r\ndid much to remove the jealousies between the provinces and to arouse a\r\nspirit of union. It evoked expressions of sympathy from Virginia and\r\nother colonies, and the merchants of New York at once joined the\r\nBostonians in a system of non-importation. Of almost equal importance\r\nwere _The Farmer's Letters_ by Dickinson, which appeared in a\r\nPennsylvania paper in 1767-68, and contained an able statement of the\r\nclaims of colonies, recommending a firm but peaceable attitude of\r\nresistance. Meanwhile the condition of the ministry was unfavourable\r\nalike to any chance of conciliation or to a consistently vigorous\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nGeorge was grievously disappointed by Chatham's illness. Between them\r\nthey had put together an administration which Burke aptly compared to a\r\npiece of mosaic, formed of men of various parties; and with it George\r\nnot unreasonably hoped to be able to carry out his ideal system of\r\ngovernment, to destroy party distinctions and establish his rule over\r\nhis people for their benefit and with their good-will.[78] In Chatham's\r\nabsence, Grafton became his principal minister, though he had no\r\nauthority in the cabinet. For a time Chatham's speedy recovery was\r\nexpected, and both the king and Grafton made constant appeals to him at\r\nleast to express his opinion on public affairs. No help was to be had\r\nfrom him; he would only entreat Grafton to remain in office. The\r\ndisorganised ministry was confronted by a strong opposition composed of\r\nthe Rockingham, Bedford, and Grenville connexions. Chatham became\r\nincapable of transacting any business; and when it was evident that his\r\nillness would be prolonged, Grafton advised the king to enter into\r\nnegotiations with them. In July, 1767, George invited Rockingham to draw\r\nup a plan for an administration. He did not intend to admit the\r\nRockinghams to office; he wanted a ministry, formed on non-party lines,\r\nwhich would be strong enough to hold its ground in parliament, and all\r\nhe wished Rockingham to do was to submit a scheme of such a ministry for\r\nhis approval, including in it some of the present ministers.\r\nRockingham, however, held the modern doctrine that a prime minister\r\nshould form his own administration, and assumed that the existing\r\nministry was at an end.\r\n\r\nHe yielded to the king's wish, but was determined not to take office\r\nexcept with a comprehensive ministry united on the basis of opposition\r\nto that court influence which had wrecked his former government. With\r\nthis idea he attempted to form a union with the Bedford party. The\r\nnegotiation failed, for Grenville and Temple, who were then united to\r\nthe Bedfords, represented to their allies that no union was possible\r\nwithout agreement as to American policy. This ended the matter, for the\r\nGrenville and Bedford parties were strongly in favour of American\r\ntaxation. Rockingham therefore told the king that he was unable to act\r\nupon his invitation. Grafton remained in office. A man of pleasure and\r\nof culture, in some points a true descendant of Charles II., he was out\r\nof his proper element in political life. He grudged leaving his kennels\r\nat Wakefield Lodge or the heath at Newmarket to transact public business\r\nin London, and preferred reading a play of Euripides at Euston to being\r\nbored by a debate at Westminster. On no other English minister have the\r\nresponsibilities of office had so little effect; he would put off a\r\ncabinet meeting for a race meeting, and even in the presence of the king\r\nand queen appeared at the opera by the side of his mistress, Nancy\r\nDawson, afterwards Lady Maynard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ACCESSIONS TO THE MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nYet, uncongenial as official work was to him, Grafton was unwilling to\r\ndesert the king and disappoint Chatham. He fully intended to carry out\r\nChatham's policy. He failed to do so, for he allowed himself to be\r\nswayed by the king; and he let things slide in a wrong direction,\r\nbecause he would not take the trouble to make any strenuous effort to\r\ncheck their course. In Chatham's absence the king gradually gained\r\ncomplete control of the ministry, and on every important question the\r\nministers followed a line wholly contrary to that which Chatham would\r\nhave adopted. Townshend died in September and North became chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer. North was an able financier, personally popular, and a\r\nsuccessful leader of the house of commons. He was a strong tory and was\r\nprepared to uphold the king's policy whether he approved it or not. At\r\nthe end of the year an agreement was made with the Bedford party. The\r\nduke, whose sight was failing and who was mourning the loss of his only\r\nsurviving son, would not himself take office, but bade his followers do\r\nas they pleased. Lord Gower became president of the council in place of\r\nNorthington; Conway resigned the seals of secretary, though he remained\r\nin the cabinet, and Lord Weymouth was made secretary of state for the\r\nnorthern department. Lord Hillsborough was appointed as a third\r\nsecretary of state for the colonies which, in consequence of the\r\nincrease of colonial business, were removed from Shelburne's department,\r\nand other members of the \"Bloomsbury gang\" received minor offices. These\r\nchanges were held to amount to the formation of a fresh administration.\r\nGeorge did not at first like the junction with the Bedfords, which\r\nseemed contrary to his policy of destroying connexions, but the new\r\nministers were so ready to carry out all his wishes that he was soon\r\ndelighted with them.\r\n\r\nThe ministry showed its bias by its action with reference to a dispute\r\nbetween the two chief magnates in Cumberland and Westmorland, the Duke\r\nof Portland, a prominent member of the Rockingham party, and Sir James\r\nLowther, Bute's son-in-law, who commanded nine seats in the house of\r\ncommons. The duke's estate in the north came to him by a grant from\r\nWilliam III. to the first Earl of Portland, in virtue of which he held\r\nthe forest of Inglewood and the socage of Carlisle, valued at about\r\nL30,000, as appurtenances to the estate expressly granted. Lowther\r\ncontended that the grant did not convey these appurtenances and applied\r\nto the treasury for a lease of them. Without officially informing the\r\nduke of his claim, the treasury granted the lease. As between subject\r\nand subject the duke's title would have been indisputable, for his house\r\nhad had undisturbed possession for over sixty years, but as regards\r\nclaims of the crown there was an ancient maxim: _Nullum tempus occurrit\r\nregi_--\"Time does not bar the king's rights\". The attempt of the\r\ntreasury to revive this maxim was considered oppressive, and was\r\ngenerally attributed to the influence of Bute and the court, and to a\r\ndesire to injure a political opponent and gratify a powerful supporter.\r\nThe feeling was strengthened by the characters of the two disputants,\r\nfor Portland was a man of high reputation, Lowther a cynical tyrant. On\r\nFebruary 17, 1768, Sir George Savile, a great Yorkshire landowner and a\r\nmember of the Rockingham party, whose integrity and wealth gave him\r\nweight in the house, brought in a bill called the _Nullum tempus_ bill,\r\nto make sixty years' possession a bar to claims of the crown. It was\r\nopposed by the ministry, and North succeeded in adjourning the motion,\r\nthough only by 134 to 114. Parliament was dissolved in March, and the\r\nnew parliament passed the bill.\r\n\r\nThe union with the Bedford party lessened any chance of American\r\nconciliation. Hillsborough ordered the Massachusetts assembly to rescind\r\nits circular letter. It refused, and, acting on Hillsborough's\r\ninstructions, Bernard dissolved the assembly. Other colonies rejected\r\nthe command to disregard the letter; they would stand or fall with\r\nMassachusetts. In New York, however, the \"whig party\" was defeated at\r\nthe elections, the assembly complied with the mutiny act, and its\r\nlegislative authority was restored. Bernard sent home disquieting\r\nreports; the revenue laws were openly defied, and the officers forcibly\r\nprevented from executing them; he was himself insulted by the mob, and\r\nhad not, he wrote, \"the shadow of authority\". There were no troops\r\nnearer than New York. Bernard, an upright and fairly able man, though\r\ntoo apt to dispute with his disputatious opponents, was extremely\r\nunpopular, for it was known that he advised the ministers to take strong\r\nmeasures. It was his duty to represent the royal authority and to\r\nmaintain the laws, and he told them that he could do nothing unless he\r\nwas supported. He was right. Between a frank surrender and a vigorous\r\nand consistent policy there should have been no middle way. The\r\nministers found one. They irritated the Americans without attempting to\r\ncrush the fomenters of disturbance; they threatened and retreated, made\r\na demonstration of force and shrank from employing it; their threats\r\nmade the British government hated, their lenity brought it into\r\ncontempt.[79] Bernard, of course, wrote as a partisan, but with this\r\nallowance his reports may be accepted as trustworthy.\r\n\r\nActing on these reports, Hillsborough, early in June, 1768, ordered Gage\r\nto send troops to Boston to protect the king's officers. It was full\r\ntime. On the 10th a sloop belonging to Hancock, a merchant of Boston,\r\narrived in the harbour laden with wine from Madeira. The tide-waiter\r\nwho boarded her was forcibly detained, and an attempt was made to\r\ndefraud the revenue by a false declaration. On this the commissioners\r\nseized the sloop and laid her under the stem of the _Romney_, a\r\nman-of-war, in the harbour. A riot ensued; the revenue officers were\r\nmobbed, one of their boats was burned, and they were forced to take\r\nrefuge in the castle. On September 29 seven ships carrying the 14th and\r\n29th regiments, and a company of artillery, in all about 1,000 men,\r\narrived in the harbour. The Bostonians refused to assign quarters for\r\nthe troops, and they suffered some hardships. On receiving the news of\r\nthe riot in June the ministers despatched the 64th and 65th regiments to\r\nBoston. These reinforcements arrived in January, 1769. The people were\r\nindignant; but in the face of so large a force remained quiet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHATHAM RESIGNS OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nOn American, as well as on other measures, Shelburne, who desired\r\nconciliation, differed from his colleagues. In the autumn of 1768 the\r\nking and the Bedford party urged his dismissal, and Grafton acquiesced.\r\nChatham was annoyed by this decision, and still more by the dismissal of\r\nSir Jeffrey Amherst, governor of Virginia. He resigned the privy seal in\r\nOctober, and Grafton was thenceforward considered as head of the\r\nministry. A few days later Shelburne resigned. He was generally disliked\r\nand distrusted. He had acted as a go-between in the early days of his\r\ncareer, and while in office was believed to be false to his colleagues;\r\nhis face answered to the popular idea of a Jesuit, and his manners were\r\nartificial. He was given the nickname of Malagrida, a Portuguese Jesuit\r\nwho had been executed for conspiracy in 1761. Weymouth took his place in\r\nthe southern, and Lord Rochford became secretary of state for the\r\nnorthern department. When parliament met in December, Bedford moved a\r\npetition to the crown to apply to Massachusetts an act of 35 Henry\r\nVIII., by which offenders outside the kingdom were liable to be brought\r\nto England for trial. This motion and eight resolutions on American\r\naffairs moved by Hillsborough passed both houses without a division,\r\nthough not without opposition, the cause of the colonists being\r\nadvocated in the commons by Pownall, an ex-governor of Massachusetts,\r\nBurke, and others.\r\n\r\nTo recommend the revival of an obsolete statute, made in a tyrannical\r\nreign and to meet different circumstances, in order to enable a\r\ngovernment to deport offenders from a distant colony and try them by\r\njuries certain to be prejudiced against them, was so contrary to the\r\nspirit of the constitution as to be defensible only on the ground of\r\nnecessity. That it would have been impossible to secure a verdict in the\r\nprovince against a rioter can scarcely be doubted. The government,\r\nhowever, advocated this measure, not because it was necessary, but\r\nmerely to frighten the colonists. This became known in America, and the\r\ncolonists learned that England had made an empty threat, and was about\r\nto adopt a conciliatory policy. The only effect of the threat was to\r\nexcite Virginia and North Carolina to non-importation. The\r\nnon-importation agreements, which were enforced by advertising the names\r\nof offending tradesmen, caused heavy loss to British trade. Between\r\nChristmas 1767 and 1769 the value of exports to America decreased by\r\nabout L700,000. The cabinet inclined to conciliatory measures, and the\r\nMassachusetts assembly was again summoned, though it professed no regret\r\nfor its past conduct. On May 1, 1769, the cabinet resolved to bring in a\r\nbill during the next session for taking off all the new duties except\r\nthat on tea. Grafton proposed to give them all up, and was supported by\r\nCamden, Conway, and Granby. North was inclined to a total repeal, but\r\nyielded to the king's influence, and declared for retaining the tea duty\r\nas a manifestation of right; Gower, Hillsborough, Weymouth and Rochford\r\nvoted with him. Grafton, though outvoted in the cabinet, remained in\r\noffice; he desired to resign, but found no \"good ground for retirement,\"\r\nfor though the king henceforward dictated his orders to him rather than\r\nasked his advice, he did not, so Grafton writes, withdraw his personal\r\nfavour. So completely was the position of a prime minister of our own\r\nday unknown at that time.\r\n\r\nHillsborough informed the colonies of the partial repeal of the duties,\r\nand of the intention of the government not to lay any further taxes on\r\nAmerica for the purpose of revenue. In its amount, namely, threepence on\r\nthe pound, the tea duty was not a grievance, for the duty of one\r\nshilling paid in England was returned on re-exportation, so that the\r\nAmericans could buy their tea ninepence per pound cheaper than in\r\nEngland. The colonial agitators, however, denied the right of taxation\r\nand the authority of parliament, and these the king and the English\r\npeople generally were determined to maintain. Hillsborough's letter was\r\nungracious, but its tone was probably of no consequence; the quarrel was\r\nnot of a sort to be allayed by smooth words. Further attempts at\r\nconciliation were made. In compliance with a petition from\r\nMassachusetts, Bernard was recalled, and his place was taken by\r\nHutchinson. Boston complained bitterly of the presence of the troops,\r\nand half of them were moved away. So long as the British force was\r\nstrong the town was fairly quiet. When it was reduced the people began\r\nto abuse and irritate the soldiers, until the insults heaped upon them\r\nled, as we shall see, to an untoward encounter. Thus did the ministry\r\nstrengthen the spirit of resistance and bring contempt upon Great\r\nBritain. For its refusal to make its concessions complete, the king is\r\nmainly responsible. A complete surrender would have humiliated him and\r\nhis realm in the eyes of the world. Whether such humiliation, surely not\r\ntamely to be accepted by a great nation, would in the end have prevented\r\nthe Americans from finding cause for quarrel and separation may possibly\r\nbe matter for discussion. It is certainly not so with the policy of the\r\nministers, that, if it can be called a policy at all, was clearly the\r\nworst they could have adopted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CONDITION OF IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nIn Irish, not less than in American, affairs the policy of the ministry\r\nwas decided by the king. Ireland was governed as a subject country. Shut\r\nout from the benefits of the navigation laws, she was only allowed such\r\ncommerce as would not bring her into rivalry with England. Since the\r\nbeginning of the century the condition of her people had slightly\r\nimproved, but in Munster and Connaught there was much terrible misery.\r\nThough the severest provisions of the penal code were obsolete, the\r\nprotestants still remained a dominant caste. Roman catholics were shut\r\nout from the bar and the army, and the sons of catholic squires for the\r\nmost part either spent their youth in idleness or served in foreign\r\narmies. The great landowners were generally absentees and their estates\r\nwere rented by middle-men; the lands were let three or four deep, and\r\nthe peasants were crushed by exorbitant rents and unjust dealing. Their\r\nburdens were increased by the tithe paid to an alien Church which was\r\nstill rather a secular than a religious power and, though more Irishmen\r\nheld preferments in it than formerly, had no place in the affections of\r\nthe people and neglected its duty, while the catholic priests, mostly\r\npoor and ignorant men, were active, were adored by their flocks, and\r\nruled them with benevolent despotism. The tithe was specially burdensome\r\nto the poor, both because the rich pasture-lands of the wealthy were\r\nexempt from payment, while it was levied on little plots worked by the\r\nplough or spade of the peasant, and because it was constantly farmed out\r\nto men who made their bargains profitable by oppressing the needy with\r\nunfair exactions. Chief among the causes of the misery of the peasants\r\nwas the extent to which arable land was converted into pasture. Commons\r\nwere unjustly enclosed, villages were depopulated, the starving peasants\r\nwere forced to flee to the mountains, and black cattle roamed at will\r\nround the ruins of their deserted dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe despair of the wretched found expression in violence. In 1761 a\r\nsecret society called the Whiteboys was organised in Munster and parts\r\nof Leinster to resist, or exact vengeance for, the enclosure of commons,\r\nand unjust rents or tithe. The movement was agrarian, not religious,\r\nthough the Whiteboys were catholics, nor political. It was formidable,\r\nfor there was no Irish constabulary or militia. The Whiteboys would\r\ngather in obedience to some secret mandate, march by night in large and\r\nordered companies, some to the land of one offender, others to that of\r\nanother, and, making the darkness hideous with their white smocks, fall\r\nto houghing cattle, destroying fences, and spoiling pastures. Many cruel\r\ndeeds were done, though the murders were few. Stern acts were passed\r\nagainst Whiteboyism; volunteers put themselves at the disposal of the\r\nmagistrates, and the rising was at last crushed, not without cruelty and\r\nan unfair administration of the criminal law. The outbreak is a notable\r\nevent in Irish history, for from that time until now secret societies\r\nwhich have attempted to gain their objects by lawless and bloody means\r\nhave constantly existed in Ireland. In protestant Ulster the Oakboys, as\r\nthey called themselves, rose in 1763 against an increase in the demands\r\nfor tithe and the burdens laid upon them for making and repairing roads.\r\nTheir rising was not accompanied by the cruelties which disgraced\r\nWhiteboyism, and was speedily pacified. Some years later the greediness\r\nof Lord Donegal, who for the sake of gain evicted over 6,000 protestant\r\nfamilies and replaced them by new tenants, many of them catholics,\r\ncaused a rising in Antrim and Down. Already numerous presbyterians of\r\nUlster, men of Scottish and English descent, had been driven by the\r\ndestruction of the woollen trade and the disabilities imposed by the\r\ntest act to emigrate to America, and many of Donegal's evicted tenantry\r\nfollowed their example. Ireland lost men who should have defended\r\nBritish interests, and America gained some of her best soldiers in the\r\nrevolutionary war. The feud between the protestants and catholics of\r\nUlster arising out of Donegal's evictions bore bitter fruit in later\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE IRISH PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nThe Irish house of commons was composed exclusively of protestants,\r\nelected exclusively by protestants. Of its 300 members sixty-four were\r\nreturned for counties and were in some measure elected by the people.\r\nTwo were returned for Trinity College, Dublin. The remainder sat for\r\ncities and boroughs, and of these 172 were nominated by borough-owners.\r\nThe duration of parliament was only terminated by the demise of the\r\ncrown. The house was the representative of the protestant aristocracy\r\nand was completely out of touch with the mass of the people. It had\r\nlittle control of finance, for the Irish establishments were large. The\r\ncivil list was burdened with pensions and sinecures, distributed either\r\nas a means of parliamentary corruption, or among the supporters of the\r\ncastle policy and the hangers-on of the English court. By Poyning's law\r\nthe Irish parliament was subordinated to the English privy council, and\r\ncould not be summoned until the bills which it was called upon to pass\r\nhad received the assent of the council. A desire for greater\r\nindependence was growing up in parliament, and a patriotic party eagerly\r\npressed for reforms, for the extension of the _habeas corpus_ act to\r\nIreland, for securing the judges in office, and for shorter parliaments.\r\nThe government was in the hands of a party called the \"Irish interest\"\r\nwhich worked harmoniously with the English ministers. Its chiefs, the\r\n\"undertakers,\" undertook the king's business in parliament, administered\r\nthe country, and dispensed patronage, for the lord-lieutenant only\r\nresided in Ireland during the session of parliament, that is for six\r\nmonths every other year. They answered roughly to the whig oligarchy in\r\nEngland at the beginning of the reign, and in spite of some extravagance\r\nand corruption used their power not altogether ill.\r\n\r\nGeorge, who was sincerely anxious for the good government of the\r\ncountry, desired, as a matter of general policy, to break down the power\r\nof the undertakers, as he had broken down the power of the whigs in\r\nEngland. He also had a special point to carry; he wanted to obtain the\r\nconsent of parliament to an augmentation of the Irish army from 12,000\r\nto 15,000 men. As the peace establishment of Great Britain was only\r\nabout 17,000 men, the crown certainly needed a larger force, but it was\r\nunfair to lay the burden of providing it on Ireland. With these objects\r\nthe ministry sent the Marquis Townshend, Charles Townshend's brother, to\r\nIreland as viceroy in 1767, ordering him to reside there throughout his\r\nterm of office. After much difficulty Townshend obtained the\r\naugmentation, with the proviso that 12,000 troops should be kept in the\r\ncountry, and the patriotic party, Lord Charlemont, Lucas, Flood, and\r\nothers, were gratified by the octennial act limiting the duration of\r\nparliament to eight years. When the new parliament met, the commons\r\nacting under the influence of the undertakers, renewed an attempt made\r\nat the beginning of the reign to establish their authority over supply\r\nby rejecting a money bill which, according to custom, had been prepared\r\nby the government and returned by the English privy council. Townshend\r\nprorogued parliament; and before its next meeting secured a majority by\r\nwholesale corruption, such as had been employed in England by Fox and\r\nBute, and overthrew the power of the undertakers. His want of tact and\r\nhis indecorous conduct rendered his victory fruitless, and he was\r\nrecalled in 1772.\r\n\r\nThe general election of 1768 was even more corrupt than that of 1761.\r\nAgain both the court and the nabobs came well to the front.\r\nBorough-mongers did a business in seats much as house-agents did in\r\nhouses. One of them laughed when Lord Chesterfield offered L2,500 for a\r\nseat for his son; the nabobs, he said, had raised prices to at least\r\nL3,000; some seats had fetched L4,000, two as much as L5,000. George\r\nSelwyn took L9,000 for the two seats for Ludgershall. The city of Oxford\r\noffered to return its two sitting members if they would pay the city's\r\ndebts, L5,670. They informed the house of commons of the offer, and ten\r\nof the leading citizens were confined for five days in Newgate, and\r\nafterwards knelt at the bar of the house and were reprimanded by the\r\nspeaker--a solemn farce, for they sold the seats to two neighbouring\r\nmagnates, and are said to have arranged the transaction while they were\r\nin prison. Holland bought a seat for his second son, Charles James Fox,\r\nthen a youth of nineteen. As was natural in his father's son, Fox\r\nsupported the ministers, and was soon distinguished in parliament by his\r\nopposition to all liberal measures, and outside it by reckless gambling\r\nand extravagance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WILKES RETURNED FOR MIDDLESEX._]\r\n\r\nWilkes, who made a short visit to England in 1766, when he remained\r\nquiet and was not disturbed, was brought back again by the election. He\r\nstood for the city of London, was at the bottom of the poll, and\r\nannounced that he would stand for Middlesex. His proceedings caused much\r\nexcitement, for the country was discontented and disturbed. The price of\r\nbread was high, and during the early part of the year there were many\r\nstrikes and much rioting, especially in London. The Spitalfields weavers\r\nmade several riots and broke the looms of those who refused to join in\r\ntheir demands. The sailors struck, and detained all outward-bound\r\nvessels in the Thames. The coal-heavers also struck, and fought fierce\r\nbattles with the sailors in which many lives were lost. Though some of\r\nthese riots broke out a little later, they explain the excitement and\r\nenthusiasm with which Wilkes was received by the London mob. He was\r\nreturned for Middlesex by a large majority. The mob which had passed out\r\nfrom London to Brentford, the polling-place, came back in triumph,\r\nforced people to illuminate their houses, and smashed many windows. If\r\non Wilkes's return to England George had granted him a free pardon, the\r\ndemagogue would probably have subsided into a peaceable member of\r\nparliament. Unfortunately he could not overlook Wilkes's insults to\r\nhimself and to his mother. Grafton came to London as seldom as possible,\r\nbut George found a willing instrument in Weymouth. On April 17 Wilkes\r\nsurrendered to his outlawry. In anticipation of disturbances Weymouth\r\nwrote to the Lambeth magistrates, bidding them, if need arose, to be\r\nprompt in calling in the aid of the military.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th Wilkes was committed to the king's bench prison. The\r\npopulace drew him along in a coach to Spitalfields, where he escaped\r\ntheir further attentions and voluntarily went to the prison. An excited\r\ncrowd daily assembled outside the prison, and the riots of the sailors,\r\ncoal-heavers, and sawyers grew formidable. Parliament was to meet on\r\nMay 10, and the king, believing that a serious riot would probably take\r\nplace on that day, recommended firmness and a prompt employment of\r\ntroops. The tone of his letters at this crisis is unpleasant and shows\r\npersonal animosity; yet neither he nor Weymouth can justly be blamed for\r\nurging prompt and decided measures, for they were necessary for the\r\npreservation of order and for the protection of life and property. As\r\nGeorge had foreseen, a riot broke out on the 10th. A vast mob gathered\r\nround the king's bench prison and in St. George's Fields, and demanded\r\nthat Wilkes should be liberated in order to take his place in\r\nparliament. The riot act was read, the troops were severely pelted, and\r\nsome soldiers killed a young man named Allen, whom they mistook for a\r\nringleader of the rioters. The order to fire was given; five of the mob\r\nwere killed and several wounded. Though for the moment the mob was\r\nmastered, this untoward event exasperated the malcontents, and much\r\nindignation was excited by an order signed by Barrington, which assured\r\nthe troops that they would be protected if \"any disagreeable\r\ncircumstance\" should arise in the execution of their duty. On June 8\r\nLord Mansfield, the lord chief-justice, reversed Wilkes's outlawry and\r\nsentenced him on the verdicts brought against him in 1764 to fines of\r\nL1,000, and twenty-two months further imprisonment.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison Wilkes obtained Weymouth's letter of April 17, and\r\npublished it with libellous comments, charging him with having\r\ndeliberately planned \"the massacre\" of St. George's Fields. These\r\ncomments were voted a seditious libel by the commons. Wilkes's petition\r\nfor redress of grievances was rejected; he was brought to the bar of the\r\nhouse and avowed the authorship of the comments on Weymouth's \"bloody\r\nscroll,\" as he called it. On the next day, February 3, 1769, Barrington\r\nproposed his expulsion from the house, and supported his motion by\r\nrecapitulating his various misdeeds. Grenville, Burke, and others urged\r\nthat it was unfair to go back to past offences and accumulate the\r\ncharges against him, and Grenville warned the house that the course on\r\nwhich it was embarking would probably lead it into a violation of the\r\nrights of the electorate. Nevertheless, the house lent itself to the\r\nwishes of the king and voted the expulsion by 219 to 137. Grenville's\r\nwarning was justified. Wilkes was re-elected on the 16th, and the next\r\nday the house annulled the election and declared him incapable of being\r\nelected to serve in the present parliament. That the house, whether\r\nacting justly or not, has a right to expel any member whom it judges\r\nunworthy to sit, is indisputable, but to declare an incapacity unknown\r\nto the law was an unconstitutional and arbitrary proceeding. In spite of\r\nthis declaration Wilkes was again returned on March 16. The election was\r\nagain annulled. An address in support of the king was prepared by the\r\ncourt party in the city, and on the 22nd hundreds set out in coaches for\r\nSt. James's to deliver it. They were pelted by a vast mob, and only a\r\nthird of them reached the palace. Meanwhile another mob gathered at St.\r\nJames's and tried to force a hearse bearing a picture of Allen's death\r\ninto the court-yard. They were foiled by the courage of Talbot, the\r\nlord-steward, and were dispersed after some scuffling. Throughout the\r\nwhole day the king exhibited perfect composure, though the riot was\r\nserious and might easily have become formidable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE RIGHTS OF ELECTORS VIOLATED._]\r\n\r\nA new writ was issued for Middlesex, and Colonel Luttrell, one of the\r\ncourt party, resigned his Cornish seat in order to oppose Wilkes. In the\r\nprevious December at the election of Serjeant Glynn, Wilkes's counsel,\r\nto the other seat for the county, one of his supporters lost his life.\r\nTwo men were found guilty of murdering him, and received a royal pardon,\r\nfor, though they assaulted him, the man's death was due to natural\r\ncauses. Luttrell was believed to be risking his life, and bets were\r\nfreely made as to his probable fate. The election, however, passed off\r\nquietly on April 13, when Wilkes polled 1,143 votes and Luttrell 296. On\r\nthe 15th, the house, after a hot debate, carried by 197 to 143 a motion\r\nthat Luttrell \"ought to have been returned\". This decision, which set at\r\nnought the rights of electors, was the inevitable outcome of the vote of\r\nexpulsion. The king was victorious, and was delighted at his victory.\r\nHis satisfaction was soon alloyed, for the means which he had employed\r\nto gain his end roused widespread indignation. He had brought himself\r\ninto conflict with his people and had blunted his weapons. He had\r\ngradually got together a set of ministers through whom he could rule;\r\nfor some of them were his willing instruments, and the rest, though\r\nuneasy at their position, forbore to oppose him. At great cost to\r\nhimself and the nation he had secured a majority in the house of\r\ncommons, and he had strengthened his cause by enlisting on his side the\r\njealousy with which the house regarded all matters of privilege. Neither\r\nhis ministers nor the house failed him, not even when called upon to\r\nviolate the constitution, but his policy rendered both alike odious to\r\nthe nation. Wilkes was a gainer by his own defeat. Thousands who had\r\nlittle or no sympathy with him personally espoused his cause when they\r\nfound it justly associated with liberty. A large subscription was made\r\nfor him: L17,000 was spent in paying his debts; his long-deferred suit\r\nagainst Halifax was at last heard, and he obtained L4,000 damages; he\r\nwas again enabled to live in comfort, and while still in prison was\r\nelected an alderman of London.\r\n\r\nOther causes contributed to the unpopularity of the ministers, among\r\nthem the French annexation of Corsica. The island rebelled against the\r\nGenoese; and they, finding themselves unable to subdue it, agreed to\r\nsell it to France. The bravery of the insurgents excited sympathy in\r\nEngland; and there was a strong feeling that the acquisition of the\r\nisland by France would increase her naval strength, which was reasonably\r\nregarded with jealousy. \"Corsica,\" said Burke, \"as a province of France\r\nis terrible to me;\" and Sir Charles Saunders, who had commanded in the\r\nMediterranean, held that to prevent the proposed annexation would be\r\nwell worth a war. There was, however, something to be said on the other\r\nside. The ministers might have pursued either one of two courses. They\r\nmight have given France to understand that they would make the\r\nannexation of the island a cause of war, and in that case France would\r\nprobably have drawn back; or they might, without loss of dignity, have\r\npassed the matter by as no concern of theirs. Unfortunately, a decided\r\ncourse was impossible to the divided cabinet. They remonstrated\r\nvigorously, and France wavered. Then the Bedford section made it known\r\nthat England would not in any case go to war, and France despised their\r\nremonstrance. Grafton allowed the Corsicans to hope for British help,\r\nand secretly sent them arms. This was worse than useless. The Corsican\r\ngeneral, Paoli, was forced to flee; the island was annexed to France in\r\n1769, and, as Burke said, \"British policy was brought into derision\".\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARREARS OF THE CIVIL LIST._]\r\n\r\nAgain, in the midst of the struggle with the Middlesex electorate,\r\nparliament was asked for L513,500 to pay the debts on the civil list.\r\nThe civil list was sufficient to meet the legitimate expenses of the\r\ncrown; the king was personally frugal; how had the deficiency arisen?\r\nBeyond all question the money had been spent in augmenting the influence\r\nof the crown by multiplying offices and pensions, by the purchase of\r\nvotes at elections, and other corrupt means. The ministers were\r\nresponsible to the nation for the way in which the public money had been\r\nspent. The opposition, and specially Grenville, Burke, and Dowdeswell,\r\nurged that before the house made the grant, it should inquire into the\r\ncauses which rendered it necessary. Their demand was resisted: the house\r\ndecided not to consider the causes of the debts, and the ministers\r\ncarried the grant without inquiry. By this evil precedent the commons\r\nabandoned the constitutional means of checking the expenditure of the\r\npublic money by the crown, and proved themselves unfaithful to their\r\nduty towards the nation.\r\n\r\nViolent attacks were made on the ministers by the press. The most famous\r\nof these are the letters signed \"Junius,\" and others attributed, some of\r\nthem with little probability, to the same author, which appeared first\r\nin the _Public Advertizer_, a London daily paper. Their fame is partly\r\ndue to the mystery of their authorship. For that doubtful honour more\r\nthan thirty names have been suggested. On strong, if not perfectly\r\nconvincing grounds, Junius is now generally believed to have been Philip\r\nFrancis, then a clerk in the war office and later a member of the East\r\nIndia council and a knight, though, if he was the author, he probably\r\nreceived help from some one of higher social position, possibly from\r\nTemple.[80] As literature the letters are remarkable for clearness of\r\nexpression and for a polish of style so high as to be artificial and\r\nmonotonous; their chief literary defect is violence of language.\r\nOccupied almost exclusively with personal vituperation, they deal with\r\nevents as opportunities for abuse rather than for thoughtful comment,\r\nwith constitutional doctrines as weapons of attack rather than as\r\nbulwarks of liberty. The writer's political opinions are based on narrow\r\ngrounds; he exhibits no power of generalisation or philosophic thought.\r\nSheltered by his carefully guarded anonymity, he exercised a vile\r\ningenuity in devising how he might wound most deeply persons whom he\r\ndared not attack in his own name. Without regard to decency or truth he\r\nmocks with devilish glee at the vices, failings, and misfortunes of the\r\nobjects of his hatred. His attacks on the chief ministers of the crown,\r\non Grafton, Bedford, North, Weymouth, and Sandwich, on Mansfield, and on\r\nthe king himself, excited intense curiosity. Before long their violence\r\ndefeated their purpose and the disgraceful \"Letter to the King,\"\r\npublished in December, 1769, excited general disgust.\r\n\r\nThe anger caused by the issue of the struggle with the Middlesex\r\nelectors found voice in petitions to the throne. Middlesex sent up a\r\nmanifesto, which was virtually adopted by London, accusing the ministers\r\nof treason; Westminster prayed for a dissolution of parliament, and some\r\ncounties and boroughs followed its example, arguing that the presence of\r\nLuttrell, who had not been duly elected, invalidated every act of the\r\nexisting parliament. London further declared itself against the court\r\nparty by electing Beckford, a prime mover in promoting the Surrey\r\npetition, as lord mayor. The country, however, was not all on the same\r\nside; the petitions were not, as a rule, signed by many of the larger\r\nfreeholders, and by the end of the year the movement seemed at a\r\nstand.[81] In July Chatham appeared at court restored to health. The\r\nking received him kindly, but must have been vexed to hear that he\r\ndisapproved of the policy of the ministers, specially with regard to the\r\nMiddlesex election. He treated Grafton with extreme coldness, and\r\nCamden, who had sneered at him in his absence, at once followed his\r\nlead. He allied himself with the opposition, with Temple, Grenville, and\r\ntheir following, and with the Rockingham party, so far as measures were\r\nconcerned. With the Rockinghams, however, he was never wholly at one;\r\nhis violence, and habit of looking beyond parliament to the people\r\nitself, and of seeking political strength in popular good-will,\r\nseparated him from them in feeling and methods of action. Yet his\r\nalliance with them was never formally broken. He entered into it\r\nbecause, he said, former differences should be forgotten when the\r\nstruggle was _pro aris et focis_. He was eager for the fray. Parliament,\r\nsaid he, \"must, it shall, be dissolved\". With him as leader and with a\r\nunited opposition, backed by a large part of the nation, victory seemed\r\nalmost certain. He reckoned without the king. An ostensible minister\r\nmight be forced to resign; but the king was a permanent official, and\r\nGeorge was hard to beat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHATHAM IN OPPOSITION._]\r\n\r\nParliament met on January 9, 1770. It was a critical time: at home\r\ndiscontent was widespread; the American colonies were disaffected; war\r\nwith France and Spain seemed not far off. The king's speech recommended\r\nattention to American affairs and hinted at the unfriendly attitude of\r\nforeign courts, but took no notice of domestic discontents, and gave\r\nprominence to an outbreak of distemper among \"horned cattle\". The cattle\r\nplague was a matter of serious national concern; yet the speech was\r\ninsufficient for the occasion; it was, Junius declared, the speech of \"a\r\nruined grazier\". It showed that the ministers intended to ignore the\r\nsigns of popular indignation. Chatham moved, as an amendment to the\r\naddress, that the lords would inquire into the causes of the prevailing\r\ndiscontents and specially into the matter of the Middlesex election.\r\n\"The people,\" he said, \"demand redress, and depend upon it, my lords,\r\nthat one way or other they will have redress;\" and he attributed their\r\ndiscontent to the action of the commons in Wilkes's case. Camden\r\nfollowed, and declared that he had beheld the arbitrary acts of the\r\nministry with silent indignation, that he would no longer keep silence,\r\nand was of the same opinion as Chatham. Mansfield opposed the amendment\r\non the ground that it infringed upon the right of the commons to be sole\r\njudges of elections and might lead to a quarrel between the two houses.\r\nChatham said that he reverenced the constitutional authority of the\r\ncommons, but they had gone beyond it, they had betrayed their\r\nconstituents and violated the constitution. He ended with a declamation\r\nexhorting the peers to act as became descendants of the barons of Magna\r\nCharta (how many of them could trace descent from so noble a source?)\r\nand like \"those iron barons, for so,\" said he, \"I may call them when\r\ncompared with the silken barons of modern days,\" to defend the rights\r\nof the people at large. His amendment was negatived. The address was\r\ncarried in the lords by 203 to 36, and in the commons after a hot debate\r\nby 254 to 138.\r\n\r\nCamden's conduct was discreditable. It is true that the maxim that a\r\nmember of the cabinet should either acquiesce in the decision of the\r\nmajority or resign his seat in it, was not then universally accepted,\r\nand that Camden had made it plain that he disapproved of the policy of\r\nhis colleagues with respect to the vote of incapacity. He had not,\r\nhowever, opposed it with any show of determination. His alliance with\r\nChatham made it certain that he could not retain the chancellorship, yet\r\nhe would not resign it, because he could inflict a harder blow on the\r\nministry as a member of it than he could when out of office. Decency\r\ndemanded that he should resign before he appealed to the lords against a\r\ndecision made by the cabinet in which he sat. He was dismissed from\r\noffice on the 17th. Granby at once threw up the ordnance and the command\r\nof the army, and Dunning, the solicitor-general, and some others also\r\nresigned. It was difficult to find a new chancellor, for the ministry\r\nwas believed to be moribund. Grafton offered the great seal to Charles\r\nYorke, the second son of the famous chancellor, Hardwicke, who died in\r\n1764. He had twice been attorney-general, and was an ambitious man. His\r\nbrother, Lord Hardwicke, and Rockingham, to whose party he had attached\r\nhimself, urged him not to accept the offer, and he declined it. On the\r\n17th, George told him that if he did not accept the great seal then, it\r\nshould never be offered to him again. He yielded, and his brother and\r\nRockingham reproached him bitterly for his compliance. He was in\r\nill-health and his malady may well have been increased by his agitation.\r\nIn any case, he died on the 20th, perhaps by his own hand. His death\r\ndefeated Grafton's one hope of strengthening the administration; he had\r\nno one in the cabinet on whose support he could rely except Conway; for\r\nWeymouth and the rest constantly acted contrary to his opinions. He\r\nresigned office on the 28th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S POLICY SUCCESSFUL._]\r\n\r\nGeorge was undaunted; he turned to the one man of eminence among his\r\nremaining ministers and appointed North to the treasury, to be held\r\nalong with the chancellorship of the exchequer. Few changes were made in\r\nthe ministry; the great seal was put in commission, and Mansfield, who\r\nremained in the cabinet, took the speakership of the house of lords.\r\nConway retired from the cabinet. Thurlow, a strong advocate of\r\nprerogative, coarse, blunt, yet insincere, became solicitor-general, and\r\nthe other vacant places were filled. Yet these changes mark an important\r\nepoch. During Grafton's administration the king became master of the\r\ngovernment, but was forced to employ unsatisfactory instruments for the\r\nexercise of his power. Though differences of opinion still arose in the\r\ncabinet, the ministry gained in solidarity and strength by the loss of\r\nits dissentient members. Above all, George at last found a first\r\nminister after his own heart. North had ability, tact, knowledge, and an\r\nunfailing good temper; he was well educated and of high moral character.\r\nThough ungainly in appearance and with no oratorical talent, he was\r\nwitty and formidable in debate. In intellect he was the king's superior,\r\nbut he allowed George's prejudices to override his convictions. He would\r\nnever be called prime minister. George was his own prime minister, and\r\nhe merely his manager and representative. His submission to the king at\r\nthe cost of his duty to the country did not proceed from selfish\r\nmotives; it was the result partly of personal attachment and partly of\r\nthe action of the stronger upon the weaker will. George repaid his\r\ndevotion by giving him his full confidence and constant support. North\r\nwas lazy, yet this defect added strength to the combination of king and\r\nminister. Behind the scenes George was active and anxious, while in\r\nparliament the weapons of indignation and sarcasm with which North was\r\nassailed failed to pierce the impenetrable wall of his amiable\r\ninsouciance. The king's policy was triumphant. The combination between\r\nthe obedient responsible minister and the imperious irresponsible king\r\nlasted for twelve years, during which George ruled as well as reigned.\r\n\r\nAgain, the point we have reached marks an epoch, because the rise of\r\nmodern radicalism has with fair reason been traced to the struggle over\r\nthe Middlesex election in 1769, though in accepting this judgment we\r\nmust not forget that the radicalism of 1819 was affected by events of\r\nlater dates. In 1769, however, as in 1819, the representatives of the\r\npeople were opposed to the will of the people. Where was sovereignty to\r\nreside? In the nation as represented in parliament, or in the nation\r\nexternal to it? When this question arises it can only be set at rest by\r\nmaking parliament truly representative of the nation. Accordingly\r\npopular discontent in 1769 was not merely directed against ministers and\r\nmeasures, it demanded radical changes in the constitutional machinery,\r\nand its demands were expressed by means which, though not\r\nunconstitutional, were not recognised by the constitution, such as\r\npublic meetings and associations. Meetings to express discontent and\r\nurge reforms were constantly held, and an association for promoting the\r\npopular demands, called the Bill of Rights Society, was formed by a\r\nclerical demagogue named Horne (afterwards Horne Tooke), Wilkes, Glynn,\r\nand others. Among the changes which they demanded as remedies for the\r\nunsatisfactory state of the representation were annual parliaments, the\r\nexaction of an oath against bribery, and the exclusion from parliament\r\nof holders of places and pensions. At this time, too, constituencies\r\nbegan to assert a right to control their representatives by sending them\r\ninstructions as to their conduct in parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHATHAM AND BURKE AS REFORMERS._]\r\n\r\nThe movement found support in parliament. A few of the minority were\r\namong its leaders; and others, though not disposed to go so far,\r\nmaintained the necessity for constitutional reforms. Whig tactics were\r\nchanged since the beginning of the reign. Beaten by the king and his\r\nfriends at the game of corruption, the whigs had become the advocates of\r\npurity of election. The fact need not reflect on personal characters.\r\nSome of the whigs of 1769 were consistent in their opposition to\r\ncorruption. As regards others, it must be remembered that abuses seldom\r\nshock a man who gains by them; they become intolerable if they are\r\nturned against him. Chatham himself once sat for Old Sarum, was elected\r\nfor Seaford apparently through bribery, and as minister was content that\r\nNewcastle should gain him support by corruption. Chief among the abuses\r\nwhich prevented the house of commons from representing the people were\r\nthe defects in its constitution. While the elections in counties and\r\nsome large boroughs were comparatively pure, the representation of the\r\nsmaller boroughs was a matter of nomination or corruption. Out of the\r\n513 members for England and Wales, 254 sat for constituencies which,\r\ntaken together, numbered only 11,500 voters, and fifty-six boroughs had\r\neach less than forty voters. Forty-four members sat for Cornish seats;\r\nMiddlesex, London and Westminster together only returned eight. Chatham\r\nat one time seemed to think that the corrupt boroughs might be got rid\r\nof, but finally feared that such a change would cause a \"public\r\nconvulsion,\" and proposed to counteract their effects by adding one\r\nmember to each of the county constituencies. After much hesitation he\r\nalso advocated a return to triennial parliaments.\r\n\r\nBurke, on the other hand, and the Rockingham party generally were\r\nopposed to any change in the constitutional machinery. The constitution\r\nwas altogether admirable in Burke's eyes; all that was wanted was the\r\nremoval of abuses, which hindered it from working well. Shorter\r\nparliaments would, he argued, only lead to more frequent disorders and\r\nincrease the opportunities for corruption; he would have no change in\r\nthe system of representation, and held that a place bill would lower the\r\ncharacter of parliament by excluding from it many men of wealth, weight,\r\nand talent. He strongly objected to the growing custom of sending\r\ninstructions to members, pointing out that members of parliament should\r\nnot be regarded as mere local delegates, but as representatives of the\r\nnation, chosen by various constituent bodies. While he was opposed to\r\nchanges in the constitution, he laboured to bring parliament into a\r\nsound state by reforms which allowed the publication of its proceedings,\r\nimproved the system of deciding the lawfulness of elections, and checked\r\nthe multiplication of places and pensions, as well as by other measures\r\nof a like tendency. The opposition then differed amongst themselves:\r\nChatham and his followers held that some organic changes in the\r\nconstitution were necessary, and more or less sympathised with what\r\n(though the name was not yet invented) may be called the radical party;\r\nBurke and those under his influence railed at the bill of rights men,\r\ndeprecated organic changes, and advocated conservative reforms.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] Lord E.

The opposition was strong and apparently united, and it had\r\na large part of the people at its back. The public expectation was\r\nill-grounded. The king's influence in parliament was not to be\r\noverborne; as many as 192 members of the house of commons held office\r\nunder government.[82] North was a first-rate leader and the king was\r\nindustrious and determined. Yet the strength of the ministry was largely\r\nderived from the conduct of their opponents. The violence of the extreme\r\nsection of the popular party led to a revulsion of feeling in the\r\ncountry. In parliament Chatham was not effective, for his declamatory\r\nspeeches and dictatorial manner were out of place in the lords; and in\r\nthe commons Burke was apt to weary the house, and lost ground through\r\nconstant breaches of good taste. Above all, the two parties in the\r\nopposition, the extreme section, with which Chatham had much sympathy,\r\nand the Rockingham whigs, did not work well together. In the spring of\r\n1770 Burke published his _Thoughts on the Causes of the Present\r\nDiscontents_, a masterly exposition of the existing political abuses and\r\nof the remedies appropriate to them. Its rejection of proposals for\r\norganic changes in the constitution annoyed Chatham, who declared that\r\nit had done much harm to the cause. He was soon irritated with the whigs\r\ngenerally. \"Moderation, moderation,\" said he, \"is the burthen of their\r\nsong;\" he would be \"a scarecrow of violence to the gentle warblers of\r\nthe grove, the moderate whigs and temperate statesmen\". He tried to\r\nforce the whigs to follow his lead, but Rockingham had no mind to court\r\nChatham's loud-voiced supporters in the city, or to adopt violent\r\nmeasures in order to assure the people that he was true to their cause.\r\nChatham thought it possible that it might be expedient to separate\r\nhimself from \"so unorthodox a congregation\" as the whig party, and\r\naccused Burke and the Rockinghams of a spirit of connexion. So bitter\r\nwere his feelings, that he and his friends rejoiced when Dowdeswell and\r\nBurke, \"those positive gentlemen,\" were defeated in an attempt to\r\nvindicate the rights of juries, because they adopted a method of\r\nprocedure of which he did not approve; they were, his friend Calcraft\r\nwrote to him, \"completely disgraced,\" and Chatham styled their bill \"a\r\ncompound of connexion, tyranny and absurdity\".[83] While the opposition\r\nwas in this distracted state the ministerial party was united. In three\r\nyears' time at most opposition in parliament was practically dead, and\r\nthe ministry was thoroughly popular in the country.[84]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A DIVIDED OPPOSITION._]\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the session of 1769-70 the opposition made a\r\ngood fight. In the lords Chatham and Rockingham co-operated in attempts\r\nto persuade the house to condemn the action of the commons with\r\nreference to the Middlesex election, and in debates on American affairs;\r\nbut Rockingham refused to join in moving an address to the king to\r\ndissolve parliament. Chatham's motion was avowedly made in order to\r\nstimulate popularity out of doors, and Rockingham, who disliked his\r\ndemagogic arts, thought it uncalled for and refused \"to be sworn every\r\nday to keep his word\" to the people. Chatham persevered, and the motion\r\nreceived little support. In the commons George Grenville, Dowdeswell,\r\nwho as Grenville's health declined became virtually leader of the\r\nopposition, Burke, Barre, Wedderburn, an able and ambitious Scottish\r\nlawyer, and others, aided by the extreme section of which Beckford and\r\nAlderman Sawbridge were conspicuous members, caused the ministry much\r\ntrouble. North was the chief speaker on the ministerial side. The court\r\nparty, or king's friends, so far as they may in any degree be regarded\r\nas distinct from the rest of his supporters, seem to have been headed by\r\nRigby, who since 1768 had lived in luxury on the vast profits of the\r\npaymaster's office. Dowdeswell's motion that in matters of election the\r\nhouse is bound to judge according to the law of the land was so\r\nthreatening an attack that North met it by tacking to it an amendment to\r\nthe effect that the declaration of Wilkes's incapacity was agreeable to\r\nthat law, and the minority reached 180 against 244. The king, anxiously\r\nwatching all that passed in parliament, felt that even this majority was\r\nsatisfactory. \"A little spirit,\" he wrote to North, \"will soon restore\r\norder in my service.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition were encouraged, and proceeded to attack two of the\r\nsources from which the crown derived its influence. As the expenses of\r\nthe customs, amounting to nearly L600,000 a year, gave ministers a large\r\namount of patronage which was used for political purposes, Dowdeswell\r\nproposed to disqualify the inferior revenue officers from voting at\r\nelections. Again, Grenville urged that parliament had paid the debts of\r\nthe civil list without receiving any assurance that further demands of\r\nthe same kind would not be made upon the country, and moved for the\r\naccounts of the past year as the only means of preventing the revenues\r\nof the crown from being spent on corruption. On both these motions the\r\nministerial majority was substantially larger than on the Middlesex\r\nquestion. Nevertheless, the opposition succeeded in carrying one measure\r\nwhich removed an abuse of the representative system and raised the\r\ncharacter of the house of commons. The custom, which had lately become\r\nusual, of trying the validity of controverted elections by the whole\r\nhouse, and determining it by vote, placed the rights of electors in the\r\nhands of the minister who commanded a majority. During the hearing of an\r\nelection petition the house would be thin, for the evidence was of\r\nlittle consequence; the decision was a trial of strength between\r\npolitical parties, each side would muster its full force, and a seat\r\nwould be secured or taken away merely in order to swell a triumphant\r\nmajority. Grenville proposed to transfer the right of hearing and\r\ndetermining these cases from the whole house to a committee of fifteen\r\nmembers, thirteen of whom were to be chosen by ballot, and the other two\r\nnominated by the two candidates. The fifteen were to be sworn to decide\r\nimpartially, and to have power to examine witnesses on oath. An effort\r\nto postpone the bill, though supported by North, was defeated by 185 to\r\n123, the country gentlemen on this occasion voting with the opposition;\r\nthe bill was carried, passed the lords, and became law on April 12. The\r\nmeasure reflects lustre on the memory of Grenville, who devised it and\r\ncarried it through when suffering from mortal sickness. The act, which\r\nwas limited in committee to seven years, was found so useful that it was\r\nmade perpetual in 1774.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE \"BOSTON MASSACRE\"._]\r\n\r\nThe decision to abandon all the new duties levied in America, except\r\nthat on tea, was brought before the house of commons by North on March\r\n6, 1770. The idea of making the Americans pay for their own defence was\r\ndropped, and the tax, which brought in only a trifling sum, was to be\r\nmaintained as an assertion of right. Grenville pointed out that a\r\npartial repeal would not conciliate the colonists, that the troubles in\r\nAmerica had been caused by vacillation, and that what was wanted was a\r\nplan of government steadily pursued and enforced. The opposition desired\r\ncomplete repeal, and the ministerial majority was only 62. On the\r\nevening before this debate an event took place at Boston which\r\nstrengthened the spirit of resistance. The cowardly insults to which the\r\nsoldiers were exposed after the reduction of their number led to various\r\nscuffles; but their discipline prevented them from effectually\r\nretaliating on their persecutors, and baiting the soldiers became a\r\npopular pastime. On the evening of the 5th Captain Preston of the 29th\r\nregiment and about a dozen soldiers went to the rescue of a sentinel who\r\nwas being ill-treated by the mob. After some provocation his men fired\r\nwithout orders, three of the mob were killed on the spot, two others\r\nwere mortally and several more slightly wounded. The next day the\r\ntownspeople, led by Samuel Adams, insisted on the removal of the troops.\r\nHutchinson yielded to their demand, and both regiments were withdrawn to\r\nCastle William. Preston and his men were brought to trial, and were\r\ntreated with remarkable fairness. All were acquitted except two\r\nsoldiers, who were slightly punished. The decision of parliament with\r\nreference to the new duties reached the colonies when the temper of the\r\npeople was excited by this untoward event, the \"Boston massacre\" as it\r\nwas called, and was regarded rather as a partial acknowledgment of\r\ndefeat than as an attempt at conciliation. Disputes, however, arose over\r\nthe non-importation agreements. Self-interest proved stronger than\r\npolitical feeling: the agreements were constantly broken; indeed, the\r\nimports to New England and Pennsylvania increased to one-half more than\r\ntheir usual amount. In October the agreements were everywhere definitely\r\nabandoned, and new agreements were made against the importation of tea\r\nonly. With that exception, commerce with England again revived.\r\n\r\nOutside parliament a strong party in the city, led by Beckford and\r\nsupported by Chatham, was clamorous against the government. In spite of\r\nthe disapproval of nearly all the aldermen, Beckford held a meeting of\r\nthe livery to complain that the petition of the city with reference to\r\nthe Middlesex election had not been answered. The meeting adopted an\r\narrogantly worded remonstrance to the king, declaring that \"a secret and\r\nmalign influence\" deprived the people of their dearest rights, and\r\ndesiring the dissolution of parliament and the removal of evil\r\nministers. In accordance with a prescriptive right, this remonstrance\r\nwas received by the king in person on March 14. George replied to it\r\nwith a severe rebuke; the remonstrance was, he said, disrespectful to\r\nhimself, injurious to his parliament, and irreconcilable with the\r\nprinciples of the constitution. The court party was much excited, and at\r\nthe Cocoa-tree Tavern, the meeting-place or club of the supporters of\r\nthe ministry, talked loudly of impeachments. North wisely held them\r\nback.[85] The house of commons could not allow the insult to itself to\r\npass unnoticed, and a copy of the remonstrance was moved for. Beckford\r\nand his friends in the house defended it, and Burke passionately urged\r\nthe folly and injustice of quarrelling with the city for exercising the\r\nright of petition and remonstrance. North calmed down the heat of the\r\ndebate, and pointed out the unconstitutional character of the\r\nremonstrance, which virtually denied the authority of the existing\r\nparliament. The motion was carried, and further debates took place. The\r\nwhigs, though firm in asserting the right of petition, disliked the tone\r\nthat had been adopted by the city, and an address to the king condemning\r\nthe remonstrance was carried by 248 to 94. Chatham was furious. With his\r\nwarm approval a remonstrance to the king was sent from Westminster, and\r\nMiddlesex and Kent followed suit; but Rockingham's refusal to support\r\nhis motion in favour of a dissolution plainly showed him that he could\r\nnot force the whigs to adopt violent measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING AND THE CITY OF LONDON._]\r\n\r\nThe city would not endure the king's rebuke in silence, and another\r\nremonstrance was adopted to the same effect as the former, though it\r\naddressed the king in more dutiful language. George received it on May\r\n23, and replied that his sentiments on the subject of the first address\r\nwere unchanged. As soon as he ceased speaking, Beckford made a harangue\r\nto which the king returned no answer. The words attributed to Beckford,\r\nand afterwards inscribed in gilt letters in the Guildhall, were that\r\nwhoever alienated the king's mind from his people in general and the\r\ncity of London in particular was his majesty's enemy and \"a betrayer of\r\nour happy constitution as it was established at the glorious and\r\nnecessary revolution\". Brave words which, as there is reason to believe,\r\nwere invented for him and never spoken.[86] Beckford's friends believed\r\nthat he had got the better of the king, and Chatham in a grandiose\r\nletter to him declared that \"the spirit of old England spoke that\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten day\". Nevertheless, Beckford's conduct was highly\r\nindecorous. The sovereign never performs a public act on his own\r\nresponsibility, and accordingly all addresses on public affairs which\r\nare to be answered in person are sent beforehand to the proper officer\r\nthat the king may receive the advice of his ministers as to his reply.\r\nBeckford tried to entrap the king into entering into a personal\r\naltercation and replying without consultation with his constitutional\r\nadvisers. George, who in public never fell short of his kingly part,\r\ndefeated his purpose by silence and afterwards ordered that his\r\nunexpected speech was not to be looked upon as precedent.\r\n\r\nHe prorogued parliament a few days before this incident. For some months\r\nhis mind had been tried severely. His power, which he loved so well and\r\nconscientiously believed himself bound to maintain, was at stake in the\r\npolitical conflict. His letters to North prove how eagerly and anxiously\r\nhe watched the progress of that conflict in which he was really, though\r\nnot ostensibly, engaged in person. If Chatham and the city had succeeded\r\nin forcing him to dissolve parliament on the ground that its authority\r\nwas vitiated by the nomination of Luttrell as a member for Middlesex, he\r\nwould have suffered a defeat which even his dogged perseverance would\r\nhave failed to retrieve. Rather than that, \"I will,\" he said to Conway,\r\n\"have recourse to this,\" and he laid his hand on his sword. The\r\nopposition had a good cause, but, as we have seen, they played their\r\npart badly. Among the reasons of their failure a conspicuous place must\r\nbe assigned to the displeasure excited by the attacks made on the king\r\nby the more violent section, the vile letter of Junius, the rudeness of\r\nthe city, and the like. The constant references which were made to some\r\nsecret influence, presumably that of his mother or Bute, which was\r\nsupposed to guide him were as foolish as they were rude, for George's\r\npolicy was his own. His anxieties and troubles were almost more than he\r\ncould bear. \"At the [royal] gardening (_sic_) party\" on June 2 he burst\r\ninto tears and talked somewhat strangely; he had, it was believed, \"for\r\nsome time been much agitated and lived (as usual when he is so) on\r\nvegetables and fruit\".[87] The symptoms happily passed away. He had,\r\nindeed, cause for cheerfulness, for the ministry was in a far stronger\r\nposition at the end of the session than when North took office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPAIN AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS._]\r\n\r\nThe next session began early, on November 13, for a war with Spain\r\nseemed imminent. Choiseul was anxious to make the Family Compact the\r\nmeans of humbling England and of regaining for France the territories\r\nshe had lost. He patiently built up a new navy, until France had afloat\r\nsixty-four ships of the line and fifty frigates; and he organised the\r\nnaval artillery. Grimaldi, the foreign minister of Spain, shared his\r\nhopes and followed his example; the Spanish navy was increased, and the\r\ndockyards well stocked, though as usual the seamen were few. For some\r\ntime both powers showed an inclination to treat England with contempt;\r\nthey believed her to be enfeebled by domestic discord, and her conduct\r\nwith reference to the Manila ransom, the annexation of Corsica, and some\r\nother matters, strengthened this opinion. In 1770 the ministers of the\r\ntwo Bourbon courts went a step too far. The Falkland islands, to the\r\neast of the straits of Magellan, though in reality only fit for\r\nsheep-farming, were generally believed to be fertile. Acting on this\r\nbelief, France took possession of the eastern island in 1764, and\r\nshortly afterwards handed it over to Spain. Meanwhile, in 1765, England\r\ntook possession of the western island and formed a settlement on it,\r\nwhich was named Port Egmont, after the first lord of the admiralty. In\r\nNovember, 1769, Captain Hunt of the _Tamar_, sloop of war, observed a\r\nSpanish schooner hovering off this settlement and warned her to depart.\r\nThe Spanish captain asserted that the island belonged to his master, and\r\ntwo Spanish frigates arrived soon afterwards and repeated the claim.\r\nHunt gave them a decided answer, and as it was agreed that both parties\r\nshould refer the claim of right to their governments, sailed for England\r\nleaving a small garrison in Port Egmont. During his absence Buccarelli,\r\nthe governor of Buenos Ayres, took forcible possession of the island,\r\nand, in order to ensure being the first to send the news to Spain, had\r\nthe impudence to remove the rudder of a British ship of war, and\r\ndetained her for twenty days.\r\n\r\nHarris, afterwards first Earl of Malmesbury, the British _charge\r\nd'affaires_ at Madrid, at once made a suitable remonstrance, but, as\r\nGrimaldi expected support from France, received no satisfaction. The\r\nBritish government, which had not bestirred itself on receiving Hunt's\r\nreport in June, at once prepared for war, and the king's speech declared\r\nthat proper reparation would be required. The navy in that year numbered\r\n337 ships, only forty-two less than in 1763, of which three were\r\nfirst-rates, fifteen second-rates, and 100 third-rates, besides\r\nforty-four sloops.[88] Some of these, however, were thoroughly rotten,\r\nand many more in bad repair, and the dockyards were short of seasoned\r\ntimber. For some years the navy had been neglected, and, though the\r\nvotes for the service had been large, much money had been eaten up by\r\nabuses. Hawke, however, had done something in breaking-up worn-out\r\nvessels, repairing, and building. Forty ships of the line besides\r\nfrigates were soon nearly ready for sea. There was some difficulty in\r\nmanning them, for the peace establishment was only 16,000 men. North\r\nsaid that 9,000 additional seamen were wanted at once, and raised the\r\nland tax to four shillings. Bounties were offered and press-gangs were\r\nbusy. The new lord mayor, Trecothick, one of the violent party in the\r\ncity, refused to sign the press-warrants. Chatham praised his\r\n\"firmness,\" but disapproved his action, for impressment was, he said,\r\nconstitutional and in times of emergency necessary. Grimaldi looked to\r\nFrance in vain. Louis, who was then under the influence of Madame du\r\nBarri, was determined not to go to war; \"my minister,\" he wrote to\r\nCharles of Spain, \"would have war, but I will not\". Choiseul was\r\ndismissed in disgrace, and was succeeded by the Duc d'Aiguillon. Spain\r\nhad no choice but to yield to the demands of Great Britain, and on\r\nJanuary 22, 1771, disowned Buccarelli's action, and agreed to deliver up\r\nPort Egmont as it was before it was seized. Throughout the whole\r\nprogress of the affair the opposition attacked the government, alleging\r\nthat it was careless of the honour of England, had exhibited a lack of\r\npromptitude, and had made a secret agreement with Spain to abandon the\r\nisland; they even insinuated that the minister had truckled to France in\r\norder to prevent her from taking part with Spain. Their attacks were\r\nfactious. The government had no desire to rush needlessly into war, but\r\nit acted with vigour and decision, and carried the matter through with a\r\nsufficiently high hand. The islands were soon afterwards deserted as\r\nunprofitable, but the British right to them was not abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe dispute with Spain caused a temporary increase in the manning of the\r\nnavy, and in 1771 the number mustered was 25,836. Though the condition\r\nof the navy was unsatisfactory, the sea-power of Great Britain was an\r\nimportant factor in European politics. With regard to them the guiding\r\nprinciple of England was the maintenance of a good understanding with\r\nRussia. Commercially this was of first-rate importance, while\r\npolitically it counterbalanced the alliance of the Bourbon courts.\r\nDuring the war between Catherine of Russia and the Turks which began in\r\n1769, Russia owed much to the good-will of England; a Russian fleet was\r\nallowed to refit at Spithead and soldiers to land for refreshment, an\r\nEnglish admiral and other officers were employed by the empress, and one\r\nof her ships of war was docked and altered at Portsmouth. A Russian\r\nfleet for the first time appeared in the Levant and inflicted a severe\r\ndefeat on the Turks. France was anxious to interfere on the side of the\r\nTurks, but was held back by the declaration that the appearance of\r\nFrench ships in the Archipelago would bring British ships thither also.\r\nA revolution effected in Sweden by Gustavus III. in 1772 opened the way\r\nfor the increase of French influence in that kingdom. This displeased\r\nRussia, and D'Aiguillon made naval preparations for the defence of\r\nSweden against any attack from Russia and Denmark. Lord Stormont, the\r\nnephew and afterwards successor of the Earl of Mansfield, who was then\r\nambassador at Paris, insisted that if a French fleet sailed for the\r\nBaltic, so too would a British fleet. The government was ready to\r\nsupport his words. In view of the increasing signs of the desire of\r\nFrance to push her interests in Europe, North in December, 1772,\r\nobtained a vote for 20,000 men for the navy. In the end France\r\ndiscontinued her preparations. Her attitude was closely connected with\r\nthe arrangement by which, in 1772, Austria, Russia, and Prussia divided\r\na large part of Poland between themselves. This act of spoliation, the\r\nfirst partition of Poland, drew forth no remonstrance from England; in\r\nitself it did not concern us, and its effect on the balance of power in\r\nEurope was regarded with complacency as lowering to France and as an\r\naggrandisement of powers which would act as a counterpoise to the\r\nBourbon alliance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MINISTERIAL CHANGES._]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1770-71 some changes took place in the ministry.\r\nWeymouth, finding himself unequal to meet the Spanish crisis, resigned\r\nthe seals, and Rochford took the southern and Halifax the northern\r\ndepartment. Hawke was succeeded at the admiralty by Sandwich, who worked\r\nhard, though he appears to have applied his industry and abilities too\r\nlargely to personal arrangements. Bathurst, an insignificant person,\r\nbecame lord chancellor, Thurlow attorney-general, and Wedderburn,\r\nhitherto a bitter opponent of the ministry, solicitor-general; he ratted\r\ndisgracefully, and was perhaps insincere from the first. Determined to\r\nattain the chancellorship, he may have intended to force North to give\r\nhim office, by showing himself dangerous in opposition. George Grenville\r\ndied in November, 1770, and several of his friends, headed by the Earl\r\nof Suffolk, a man of small ability, went over to the ministerial side.\r\nSuffolk was made privy seal and, on the death of Halifax in the\r\nfollowing June, became secretary of state. He was succeeded as privy\r\nseal by Grafton, who, in accepting the office, showed his lack of\r\nconfidence in his colleagues by stipulating that he should not be\r\nsummoned to cabinet meetings. Besides the serious blow which the\r\nopposition at large sustained in the death of Grenville, Beckford's\r\ndeath, soon after his egregious performance at St. James's, deprived\r\nChatham of an eager follower and the city party of its leader. Later in\r\nthe year, too, died Granby, who a few months before repented of the\r\nsupport he had given to the ministry and had joined the opposition.\r\n\r\nThe violent language employed by the newspapers on the opposition side\r\nlaid them open to reprisals. Constant resort to indictments by the\r\nattorney-general, and the exception of seditious libels from privilege\r\nof parliament, indicate the desire of the king's party to treat press\r\noffences in a special way. They were gratified by a ruling of\r\nChief-justice Mansfield in the case of Almon, a bookseller, who was\r\ntried on an _ex officio_ indictment for selling Junius's _Letter to the\r\nKing_. Mansfield laid down that in cases of libel the jury could only\r\ndeal with the facts of printing and publishing; it belonged to the judge\r\nto decide the character of the statement. This was not a new doctrine;\r\nit had been declared and acted upon by many earlier judges. The\r\nnewspaper press, however, had by this time become important, and\r\nMansfield's ruling infringed on the liberties of those engaged upon it,\r\nfor, while that was the law, a man after being indicted by the\r\nattorney-general, who held office by, and at the pleasure of the crown,\r\nwas deprived of his right to be judged by his peers on the substantial\r\npoint at issue. Indignant juries refused to convict in libel cases, and\r\nMansfield's ruling was attacked by the opposition in parliament. Chatham\r\nand Camden denied its legality. In the commons, though a proposal to\r\nabolish _ex officio_ informations received little support, a motion for\r\na committee of inquiry into the rights of juries was only defeated by\r\n184 to 176. Dowdeswell and Burke believed that the question of law was\r\nlikely to hinder a satisfactory settlement, and in March, 1771,\r\nDowdeswell moved for an act to give juries the powers denied to them. A\r\nsection of the opposition, however, held with Chatham and Camden that\r\nthe matter should be settled by a bill declaring that the law gave them\r\nthese powers. They would not support the motion, which was lost by an\r\noverwhelming majority; and Mansfield's ruling was received as law until\r\n1792.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE PRINTERS._]\r\n\r\nAnother matter connected with the press engaged the house of commons for\r\nthe most part of the remainder of the session of 1771. Parliament, as\r\nwe have seen, was so constituted that occasions might and did arise on\r\nwhich the will of the people was not fairly represented. This\r\nconstitutional difficulty was increased by the secrecy in which\r\nparliament shrouded its proceedings. Once useful as a means of securing\r\nfreedom of debate, this secrecy was maintained as a matter of privilege\r\nafter it had become useless and, indeed, pernicious. It was carried to\r\nan extreme point by the present parliament, the \"unreported parliament\"\r\nas it was called. Strangers were constantly made to withdraw from both\r\nhouses, specially when a popular member of the opposition rose to speak.\r\nThis caused a silly quarrel between the two houses in 1770, and either\r\nshut its doors against the members of the other. The publication of\r\nreports, forbidden by a standing order of 1762, had for some time been\r\ncarried on under various disguises, and the reports, which were founded\r\non scanty information, were often unfair and scurrilous. In February,\r\n1771, Colonel Onslow complained of two newspapers which misrepresented\r\nhis conduct in the house, and held him up to contempt by describing him\r\nas \"little cocking George\". Disregarding a warning from Burke as to the\r\nfolly of entering into a quarrel with the press and attempting to keep\r\nits proceedings from the public, the house ordered the printers, Wheble\r\nand Thompson, to attend at the bar. The serjeant-at-arms failed to find\r\nthem, and was jeered at by their workmen. A proclamation was then issued\r\nfor their arrest. While this affair was pending several newspapers\r\ncommented on the proceedings of the house, and attacked various members,\r\nand specially Onslow, describing him as \"a paltry insignificant insect\"\r\nand so on. On March 12 he moved to proceed against six other printers.\r\nThe opposition, led by Dowdeswell, Burke, and Barre, made a determined\r\nstand. They divided the house twenty-three times, and it sat till 5 A.M.\r\n\"Posterity,\" said Burke, \"will bless the pertinaciousness of that day.\"\r\nOnslow's motion was carried; some of the printers were reprimanded, one,\r\nMiller, refused to attend.\r\n\r\nThe city reformers seized the opportunity of renewing their quarrel with\r\nthe house. Wheble and Thompson were collusively arrested and were\r\ndischarged, Wheble by alderman Wilkes and Thompson by alderman Oliver,\r\nas not being accused of any crime. Worse was to come. Miller was\r\narrested by a messenger of the house, and gave the messenger in charge\r\nfor assaulting him. Both were brought before Brass Crosby, the lord\r\nmayor, Wilkes, and Oliver; Miller was discharged, the messenger held to\r\nbail. The house ordered Crosby and Oliver, who were both members of it,\r\nto attend in their places, and Wilkes, who was at the bottom of the\r\naffair, at the bar. Wilkes refused to attend unless as member for\r\nMiddlesex, and the house, with more discretion than valour, shrank from\r\nanother conflict with him. The king, who was deeply interested in the\r\nquarrel, approved; he would, he said, \"have nothing more to do with that\r\ndevil Wilkes\". Crosby and Oliver defended their conduct, and were\r\ncommitted to the Tower. During the proceedings an angry crowd\r\ninterrupted the business of the house, pelted several members, roughly\r\nhandled North and Charles Fox, who was conspicuous as a defender of\r\nprivilege, and broke their carriages. The lord mayor and Oliver were\r\nvisited in the Tower by Rockingham, Burke, and other members of the\r\nopposition. On their release, at the end of the session, on May 8, they\r\nwere saluted by the cannon of the artillery company and by vociferous\r\napplause, and the city was illuminated. Proceedings against the\r\nmessenger were stopped by the attorney-general. Though the house was\r\nvictorious, its dignity suffered so greatly in the conflict that it\r\nforbore to follow up its victory. Burke's words proved true; for though\r\nthe publication of debates was still held to be a breach of privilege,\r\nno further attempt was made to punish it. Soon after this dispute with\r\nthe house of commons the city reformers quarrelled amongst themselves,\r\nand the party was split up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT._]\r\n\r\nThough political disputes dulled the interest excited by theological\r\nquestions in the earlier half of the century, the house of commons was\r\ninvited on February 6, 1772, to abolish the subscription to the\r\nThirty-nine Articles which was demanded of all clergymen and of all\r\nstudents matriculating at Oxford and Cambridge. The movement was\r\nconnected with a tendency towards unitarianism, which, besides\r\nattracting many dissenters, exercised an influence within the Church.\r\nSome churchmen seceded; others, less decided, sought to be relieved of\r\nan unwelcome obligation. An association which met at the Feathers\r\nTavern, in the Strand, sent a petition to the house signed by about two\r\nhundred and fifty men, clergy, doctors, and lawyers, praying to be\r\nrelieved of subscription. The king was hostile to the petition, and\r\nNorth opposed it in moderate terms. Burke spoke against it with\r\nremarkable ability, pointing out that a standard of faith was necessary\r\nto insure order in the Church, and that subscription to the Bible would\r\nnot, as the petitioners maintained, afford any criterion of belief. The\r\npetition was rejected by a large majority, though several members on\r\nboth sides expressed a dislike to requiring subscription at the\r\nuniversities from youths who were not of an age to judge of such\r\nmatters. The house, though it refused to allow clergymen to evade the\r\nformularies of their Church, was not averse from toleration. A bill to\r\nrelieve dissenting ministers and teachers from subscription to certain\r\nof the articles, which was indeed rarely exacted, was carried in the\r\ncommons with little opposition, but the king and the bishops were\r\nstrongly opposed to it; the royal influence was used against it in the\r\nhouse of lords, which threw out the bill both in 1772 and 1773, and it\r\ndid not become law until six years later.\r\n\r\nThe opposition was moribund. An annual motion was made for shortening\r\nthe duration of parliaments; but it attracted little attention, and\r\nother questions which had lately agitated men's minds fell equally out\r\nof date. A momentary revival of political excitement was caused by a\r\nbill which affected the king personally. George had family troubles. His\r\nsister Caroline, Queen of Denmark, was accused of adultery and\r\nimprisoned; she was allowed to retire to Hanover, and remained there\r\nuntil her death. Soon after hearing of her daughter's disgrace the\r\nking's mother died of cancer. She had long ceased to have any political\r\ninfluence and was eminently charitable, yet the sufferings of her last\r\ndays were exulted over by scribblers opposed to the court, and her\r\nfuneral was hailed with the cheers of the city mob. About the same time\r\none of George's brothers, the Duke of Cumberland, after disgracing him\r\nby his flagrant immorality, married Mrs. Horton, the widowed daughter of\r\nLord Irnham, and sister of Luttrell, the Middlesex member; and the\r\nprivate marriage of another brother, the Duke of Gloucester, to the\r\nwidow of Lord Waldegrave, a bastard daughter of Horace Walpole's\r\nbrother, was publicly announced. George was deeply annoyed by these\r\nmarriages and forbade the offenders to appear at court. At his wish the\r\nroyal marriage bill was laid before parliament. By this act no\r\ndescendant of George II. under the age of twenty-six can enter into a\r\nvalid marriage without the sovereign's consent; nor above that age,\r\nshould the sovereign's consent be withheld, except by giving a year's\r\nnotice to the privy council, so that parliament may, if it chooses,\r\nforbid the marriage. The doctrine implied in this act, that the whole\r\nroyal family forms a class apart from the rest of the nation, was\r\nforeign to English ideas and smacked rather of German than English\r\nroyalty. Yet, whatever the effects of the act may have been on those\r\nmost nearly concerned, they have been beneficial to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe bill excited much disapproval and was vigorously opposed in\r\nparliament. In the commons the preamble, which acknowledged the\r\nprerogative asserted by the crown, was passed only by a majority of\r\nthirty-six, and the bill was finally carried by 165 to 115. Among its\r\nopponents were Burke and Charles Fox, by that time a power in the house.\r\nNo man probably has ever enjoyed greater popularity than Fox. His\r\ndisposition was amiable and generous, his good nature inexhaustible, his\r\nheart full of warm and humane feelings. As a mere lad he had been\r\ninitiated into vice by his father's folly; he drank, lived loosely,\r\ndressed extravagantly, and was an inveterate and most unlucky gambler;\r\nhis losses were indeed too constant to be wholly due to ill-luck. At\r\ntwenty-five he owed L140,000, which his father paid for him. He was a\r\nkeen sportsman, and he cared for higher things than sport. He was\r\naccomplished, a lover of learning and art, and found unfailing pleasure\r\nin the masterpieces of Greek, Latin, English, French, Italian, and, in\r\nlater days, Spanish literature. In parliament he had hitherto opposed\r\nall popular measures, sometimes with insolent flippancy. He was\r\nappointed a lord of the admiralty in 1770. He gradually came under\r\nBurke's influence and showed signs of remarkable talents in debate. His\r\nspeeches were unprepared, his statement of a case was often made\r\nconfusedly, but he was splendid in reply. His career as a statesman was\r\nmarred, like his private character, by an utter lack of principle. His\r\nopposition to the royal marriage bill seems to have been a matter of\r\nprivate feeling. His father had united the plebeian family of Fox with a\r\nhouse descended from a royal bastard by a runaway marriage with Lady\r\nCaroline Lennox; and Charles was hot against a bill which annulled a\r\nmarriage made without legal consent, and must have derived special\r\nsatisfaction in opposing the wish to preserve the royal family from\r\nderogatory marriages on the part of the faithless lover of his favourite\r\naunt, Lady Sarah. He resigned office, but re-entered the ministry the\r\nfollowing December.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NORTH'S REGULATING ACT._]\r\n\r\nThe strength of the ministry caused a stagnation in matters of domestic\r\npolicy, and parliament turned its attention towards a settlement of the\r\ngovernment of India. In 1772 the East India Company was on the verge of\r\nbankruptcy, owing chiefly to expensive wars, large pensions to native\r\nrulers, and the greed of the proprietors. The successes of Haidar in the\r\nKarnatic and the famine in Bengal sent down the price of stock, as we\r\nhave seen, 60 per cent. The company applied to government for a loan of\r\nat least L1,000,000. North, with statesmanlike decision, seized the\r\nopportunity of asserting the right of the crown to the territorial\r\nrevenue and of placing the government under the control of its\r\nministers. The king upheld his policy. Select and secret committees were\r\nappointed by the commons to inquire into the condition of the company\r\nand of the British affairs in India. Acting on the recommendation of the\r\nsecret committee, North foiled an attempt of the company to keep its\r\naffairs in its own hands by carrying a bill to restrain it from\r\nappointing supervisors in India. Burke violently opposed this and every\r\nstep by which the territorial power of the company was brought into\r\nsubjection to parliament. It was, indeed, with some justice that he\r\nurged that the violation of the royal charter held by the company was a\r\ndangerous precedent, that the claim to the territorial revenue was\r\narbitrary, and that parliament had increased the company's distress by\r\nextorting from it the payment of L400,000 a year, and had done nothing\r\nfor it in return. The case for the company was supported in both houses\r\nby the Rockingham party generally.\r\n\r\nNorth was supreme in both houses, and, in June 1773, carried his\r\nregulating bill. The company received from government a loan of\r\nL1,400,000 at 4 per cent., its annual payment of L400,000 was remitted\r\nuntil the loan was repaid; its future dividends were restricted in\r\namount, and its authority in accepting bills from India curtailed; it\r\nwas to submit its accounts to the treasury, and to export British goods\r\nto a certain yearly value. In order to assist the company which had a\r\nlarge stock of tea on hand, it was agreed that it might export this tea\r\ndirect and duty free to America, a decision which proved of momentous\r\nimport. A court of supreme jurisdiction was created, consisting of a\r\nchief justice and three puisne judges, appointed by the crown and with\r\nfixed salaries. The governor of Bengal was made governor-general of\r\nBritish India and was to act with a council of four. The first\r\ngovernor-general, Warren Hastings, then governor of Bengal, and his\r\ncouncil were appointed by the act; their successors were to be appointed\r\nby the directors and approved by the crown. All military and civil\r\nmatters which came before the directors were to be submitted to the\r\ncrown. No officer of the crown or of the company was to accept any\r\npresents. The act transferred the government of India from a trading\r\ncompany to the crown. Constitutionally, its weakest point was the\r\nappointment of executive officers in parliament; for all officers should\r\nbe appointed by the crown, and its action should be subject to\r\nparliamentary check. As regards the arrangement of government, the act\r\nshould have defined the relations between the supreme court and the\r\ncouncil, and between the governor-general, the directors, and the crown,\r\nand should not have left the governor-general in a position to be\r\noverruled by his council.\r\n\r\nDuring the debates on these measures the publication of the report of\r\nthe select committee excited public feeling against the \"nabobs,\" and\r\nspecially against Clive, and a parliamentary inquiry was held into his\r\nconduct. Before the select committee he admitted and defended the deceit\r\nwhich he had practised on Omichand in 1757, and declared that he was\r\njustified in accepting enormous sums from Mir Jafar. They were as\r\nnothing compared to what he might have had; \"Mr. Chairman,\" said he, \"at\r\nthis moment I stand astonished at my own moderation\". Resolutions\r\ncondemning his conduct were moved by Burgoyne. He defended himself with\r\nforce and dignity. Finally, after many debates, the house voted that he\r\nhad through the power entrusted to him possessed himself of L234,000,\r\nrefused to vote that he had abused his power, and voted instead that \"he\r\ndid at the same time render great and meritorious services to this\r\ncountry\". The matter was not made a party question, and the decision was\r\nworthy of the assembly which pronounced it. The king, while fully\r\nacknowledging Clive's services, thought him guilty of \"rapine,\" and\r\ndisapproved of his virtual acquittal. Thurlow attacked, Wedderburn\r\nzealously defended him. The court party voted different ways. Physical\r\nsuffering together with the strain of these proceedings affected Clive's\r\nmind, and he died by his own hand on November 22, 1774.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S POLITICAL PREDOMINANCE._]\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the king's political predominance was firmly established. His\r\nwill was law to his ministers, and they commanded overwhelming\r\nmajorities in both houses of parliament. The country was satisfied that\r\nit should be so, for the quarrel between the people and parliament had\r\ndied out. It was a time of political apathy. The balance of power, which\r\nduring Walpole's administration had shifted from the lords to the\r\ncommons, was shifting from parliament to the crown. The house of commons\r\nwas losing its spirit of independence, and the control which it should\r\nhave exercised on the executive was endangered by the growth of the\r\nking's personal authority. So long as George ruled the country\r\nsuccessfully this danger was likely to increase. He had so skilfully\r\nstrengthened his position that he had triumphed over domestic agitation.\r\nThe just working of the constitution was finally restored through\r\nnational calamity. American discontents were to lead to a revolt which\r\nthe enemies of England used as an opportunity for attacking her. Their\r\nattacks were formidable in themselves, and had the humiliating result of\r\nforcing Great Britain to give up the struggle with her revolted colonies\r\nand acknowledge their independence. George had chosen to be his own\r\nprime minister, and his policy was to suffer defeat. A period of storm\r\nwas ahead, and as the ship of state passed through it, the king's\r\npersonal rule, and much else besides, went overboard. All this was still\r\nfar off. From 1770 to 1774 the affairs of the American colonies excited\r\nlittle attention in England, though, as we shall see in the next\r\nchapter, they were tending towards open revolt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] _Annual Register_, xiii.

Samuel Adams had no\r\nsuch inclination, and did all in his power to fan the smouldering embers\r\nof strife. For some time longer he and his friends professed loyalty,\r\nbut he at least was consciously working for separation. A rising in\r\nNorth Carolina, called the regulators' war, because the insurgents\r\nclaimed to regulate their own police affairs, was smartly quelled by the\r\ngovernor, Tryon, in 1771; it need not detain us, for it had no connexion\r\nwith the quarrel with England. There was much lawlessness elsewhere.\r\nMobs tyrannised over their more loyal neighbours, tarring and feathering\r\nsome of those who would not comply with their demands, and using other\r\nbarbarous modes of advancing the cause of liberty. In Boston the revenue\r\nofficers were exposed to insult and violence. Hutchinson held the\r\nassembly of the province at Cambridge, and further disgusted his\r\nopponents by informing them that he was no longer dependent on their\r\nvotes for his salary; it would thenceforward be paid by the king. The\r\nmore peaceable Americans were gratified in 1772 by the appointment of\r\nthe Earl of Dartmouth to succeed Hillsborough as secretary for the\r\ncolonies, for Dartmouth, a pious and amiable person of no political\r\nability, was known to be anxious for conciliation. Fresh cause of\r\noffence, however, was found in a decision of the ministers that the\r\nsalaries of the Massachusetts judges should be paid by the crown instead\r\nof by the colony. This change, which was designed to render the judges\r\nindependent of popular feeling, was resented as an attempt to make them\r\nsubservient to the crown, for they held office during the king's\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HUTCHINSON'S LETTERS._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the contempt with which the authority of the crown was\r\nregarded, and the necessity for restraining the provincial judges from\r\npolitical partisanship, were forcibly illustrated. Smuggling was carried\r\non freely, especially in Rhode Island. The duty of preventing it in\r\nNarragansett Bay was discharged by Lieutenant Duddingston, in command of\r\nthe _Gaspee_ schooner. He was zealous, and, according to American\r\naccounts, was guilty of illegal and oppressive acts. On June 9, while\r\nengaged in a chase, the _Gaspee_ ran aground, and on the night of the\r\n10th was boarded by eight boat-loads of men. Duddingston was\r\ntreacherously shot at and wounded; he and his men were set on shore, and\r\nthe schooner was burnt. This destruction of one of the king's ships, an\r\nact alike of rebellion and piracy, and, as Thurlow said, \"an event five\r\ntimes the magnitude of the stamp act,\" was unpunished. A law, enacted in\r\nthe previous April, and evoked by a fire in an English dockyard,\r\nprovided that the setting on fire of a public dockyard or a king's ship\r\nshould be felony, and that those accused of such an offence should be\r\ntried in England. Commissioners were appointed by the crown to inquire\r\ninto the destruction of the _Gaspee_, and send those concerned in it to\r\nEngland for trial. On their applying for warrants to the chief justice\r\nof the province, he declared that he would allow no one to be arrested\r\nwith a view to deportation, and the commission was fruitless. The\r\ncolonists were angered by this attempt to enforce the law; and in 1773\r\ntook an important step towards union and a future congress by\r\nestablishing committees of correspondence between the provinces.\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams unexpectedly found an opportunity of rousing fresh\r\nexcitement in Massachusetts. A number of private letters written by\r\nHutchinson and Oliver, the deputy governor, to a gentleman of England,\r\nnamed Whately, and stolen after his death, were sent over by Franklin to\r\nthe committee of correspondence at Boston, were read by Adams to the\r\nassembly, and were subsequently published. Hutchinson, a patriotic\r\nAmerican, was a faithful servant of the crown and believed in the\r\nsupremacy of parliament. His letters contained no statements that were\r\nnot true and no comments discreditable to a man of honour, holding the\r\nopinions on which he had consistently acted. They were declared to be\r\nevidences of malice and bad faith; he and Oliver were, John Adams said,\r\n\"cool-thinking, deliberate villains,\" and the assembly sent a petition\r\nto the king for their removal. The letters were industriously circulated\r\nthroughout the province, and were denounced by preachers in their Sunday\r\nsermons. Such was the state of affairs when, in accordance with the act\r\nof parliament authorising the East India Company to export its surplus\r\nstock of tea direct to America, three ships laden with tea appeared in\r\nBoston harbour. Other ships with like cargoes had also been despatched\r\nto New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. At Boston, on the night of\r\nDecember 16, a large body of men, disguised as Indians and encouraged by\r\nSamuel Adams and his friends, boarded the ships and emptied their\r\ncargoes, 340 chests of tea valued at L18,000, into the sea. The ships\r\nfor Philadelphia and New York returned to London without discharging\r\ntheir cargoes. At Charleston the tea was landed, but the consignees were\r\nforced to renounce their engagement, and the tea rotted in the cellars\r\nof the custom-house.\r\n\r\nIn England the Boston riot caused much irritation. The news came when\r\nthe publication of Hutchinson's letters was exciting strong feelings.\r\nWho was responsible for their abstraction from Whately's correspondence\r\nwas for some time a mystery. Franklin kept his counsel, and a duel took\r\nplace between Whately's brother and a Bostonian who was suspected of\r\nstealing them. Then Franklin declared that he alone had obtained them\r\nand sent them to Boston. As agent for Massachusetts he appeared before a\r\ncommittee of the privy council on January 29, 1774, in support of the\r\npetition against Hutchinson and Oliver. Both sides were heard by\r\ncounsel. Wedderburn, who spoke against the petition, made a violent\r\nattack on Franklin; he described him as a thief and accused him of\r\nacting from the meanest motives. The temper of his audience was\r\nirritated by the news from Boston, and his speech was received with\r\nmanifestations of delight, indecent on the part of men sitting as judges\r\nin that august court. The petition was rejected as groundless and\r\nscandalous, and men went away \"almost ready to throw up their hats for\r\njoy,\" as though a lawyer's bitter tongue had given England a victory.\r\nFranklin was at once dismissed from his office of deputy postmaster.\r\nWedderburn's speech and the spirit in which it was received were\r\nimpolitic as well as discreditable. While strongly opposed to the\r\nministerial policy in America, Franklin had shown himself anxious to\r\nmaintain the tie between Great Britain and her colonies. This attack\r\nupon his character made him one of England's enemies, and, as it proved,\r\none of the most dangerous of them. His conduct is not palliated by the\r\nindecency of his opponents. It has been urged in his defence that, as\r\nWhately had shown the letters to certain English politicians, it was\r\nfair that Boston politicians should also see them, that as agent he was\r\nbound to do the best for his province, and that governments did\r\nintercept and use correspondence which was believed to contain important\r\npolitical information.[89] Conduct befitting a man of honour needs no\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOX DISMISSED FROM OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nThe general opinion in England was that Boston should be punished, and\r\nthat if the government made an example of that rebellious town, the\r\nAmericans would learn a wholesome lesson. The king held this opinion,\r\nand was delighted when General Gage told him that the Americans \"would\r\nbe lions whilst we are lambs, but if we take the resolute part they will\r\nundoubtedly prove very meek\". He determined to force Boston to\r\nsubmission, and his ministers were at his command. A junior lord of the\r\ntreasury was insubordinate, and was promptly dismissed. It seemed a\r\nsmall matter, but it had important consequences, for the rebel was\r\nCharles Fox. He had more than one grudge against the king, and he was\r\nperhaps growing impatient of serving under a minister who was virtually\r\nthe king's representative, though his actual revolt may have been an\r\nunpremeditated ebullition of youthful vanity. A libel on the speaker, of\r\nwhich the turbulent parson, Horne, was the author, gave him an\r\nopportunity for self-display; he usurped the functions of leader of the\r\nhouse, persuaded it to enter on proceedings which might have ended in\r\nanother awkward quarrel with a printer, and placed North in a most\r\nembarrassing position. The king, whom he had already offended by his\r\nopposition to the royal marriage bill, heartily disliked him, and urged\r\nNorth to get rid of him. He was curtly dismissed from office on February\r\n24. He at once went into opposition, and acted generally with the\r\nRockingham party, though he did not distinctly join it until a later\r\nperiod. He was already intimate with Burke, who soon gained much\r\ninfluence over him. On almost every question he combated the opinions\r\nwhich he had previously supported, and constantly attacked his former\r\nchief with great bitterness. In debate the opposition gained enormously\r\nby his alliance, but it was in the end injurious to their cause. His\r\nsympathy with the enemies of his country in time of war strengthened the\r\nking and his ministers in their efforts to maintain the honour of\r\nEngland by persevering in the struggle, for it revolted the patriotic\r\nfeelings of the nation and kept it steadfast in its support of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE PENAL ACTS._]\r\n\r\nOn March 14 North began to lay before the commons the measures by which\r\nthe government hoped to bring the Americans to submission. By the first\r\nof these penal laws, as they are called, Boston was to be punished by\r\nthe transference of the seat of government to Salem, and by the closing\r\nof its harbour, which entailed the suspension of its trade, until the\r\ntown had made good the loss inflicted on the East India Company, and the\r\nking was satisfied that the laws would be observed. North spoke with\r\nremarkable moderation. Both he and Dartmouth disliked violent measures,\r\nand their tone with regard to America was so different from that of\r\ntheir colleagues, that it indicated a division in the cabinet.[90] The\r\nbill met with little opposition in the commons, though Dowdeswell and\r\nBurke spoke against it. In the lords, Rockingham and Shelburne opposed\r\nit, Chatham was absent through ill-health, and Mansfield strongly\r\nadvocated it, declaring that Boston had committed \"the last overt act of\r\ntreason,\" and that it was a lucky event, for if the bill passed we\r\nshould have crossed the Rubicon, the Americans would see that we would\r\ntemporise no longer, and if it passed unanimously, Boston would submit\r\nwithout bloodshed. The bill passed both houses without a division. The\r\nnext bill, \"for regulating the government of Massachusetts Bay,\"\r\noverthrew the charter of the colony; it increased the power of the\r\ngovernor, vested the nomination of the council in the crown, altered the\r\nsystem by which juries were chosen, and prohibited town meetings, the\r\nprincipal engine of democratic rule, from being held without the consent\r\nof the governor. The abrogation of chartered rights excited strong,\r\nthough ineffectual, opposition; the bill was passed in the commons by\r\n239 to 64, and in the lords by 92 to 20, eleven peers signing a protest\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThis measure was calculated to alarm and irritate the colonies\r\ngenerally, for the alteration of the charter of one of them would be\r\ntaken as a menace to the constitutional liberties of all. In the hope of\r\ncounteracting this effect, the opposition wished the house of commons,\r\nbefore it passed the bill, to conciliate the Americans by repealing the\r\ntax on tea.[91] A motion was made for the repeal on April 19, and was\r\nsupported by Burke in a speech of remarkable power. He maintained that\r\nthe concession would be well received, and entreated the house to resort\r\nto its old principles, to be content to bind the colonies by laws of\r\ntrade, to disregard the question of its right, and to refrain from\r\ntaxation. Only forty-nine voted for the motion. A third bill ordered\r\nthat any one accused of a capital offence should, if the act was done in\r\nthe execution of the law in Massachusetts, be tried in Nova Scotia or\r\nGreat Britain; and a fourth provided for the quartering of troops. When\r\nthe quartering bill was before the lords, Chatham returned to\r\nparliament. He opposed the bill, declared his dislike of the Boston port\r\nbill, which, he said, punished a whole town for the crime of a few; and\r\nwhile he condemned the turbulence of the Americans, declared that their\r\ndiscontent was due to the irritating treatment they had received, and\r\nurged that England should act towards them as a fond and forgiving\r\nparent, for the time was at hand when she would \"need the help of her\r\nmost distant friends\". On all these bills the numbers of the minority\r\nwere very low, and the king declared himself \"infinitely pleased\" with\r\nthe reception they met with. Meanwhile Hutchinson was recalled, and Gage\r\nwas appointed governor of Massachusetts as well as commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE QUEBEC ACT._]\r\n\r\nAnother bill, closely connected with the state of affairs in America,\r\nthough not devised merely with reference to it, provided for the\r\ngovernment of Canada, which had remained as it had been settled\r\ntemporarily by royal proclamation in 1763. The province of Quebec, as it\r\nwas called, only extended eastward to the St. John's river on the north\r\nof the St. Lawrence, the territory beyond being annexed to the\r\njurisdiction of Newfoundland, while on the south the islands of Cape\r\nBreton and St. John (Prince Edward's island) belonged to Nova Scotia.\r\nNo settlement was made as to the country west of the Appalachian range,\r\nwhich was claimed by the old colonies, nor as to the vast tract between\r\nLake Nipissing and the Mississippi, the boundary of the Spanish land.\r\nThe government of Canada was in the hands of a military governor-general\r\nand a council. In 1764 the English-speaking and protestant population\r\nwas a mere handful; in 1774 it numbered about 360, while the French\r\nRoman catholics were at the least 80,000. In accordance with the treaty\r\nof Paris the catholics had full liberty of worship. English was,\r\nhowever, the only official language, and all offices were held by men of\r\nBritish nationality. The administration of the law was confused, and,\r\nthough the king's proclamation held out a prospect that an assembly\r\nmight be called, it required oaths and declarations which would have\r\nshut Roman catholics out from it. The French disliked the English law\r\nwith reference to land, and as far as possible evaded it. Constant\r\ndifficulties arose, and, in 1766, Charles Yorke, then attorney-general,\r\nadvised that English should cease to be the only official language, and\r\nthat French law should be recognised in cases which concerned land. On\r\nthe other hand the British minority, largely consisting of immigrants\r\nfrom New England, pressed for an assembly, which would have strengthened\r\nand perpetuated their supremacy over their French neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe discontent in the American colonies made the ministers specially\r\nanxious to conciliate the French Canadians, and with the advice of Sir\r\nGuy Carleton, the governor, they brought in a bill for the government of\r\nthe province. The Quebec act of 1774 included in Canada the territory\r\npreviously annexed to Newfoundland, and extended its boundaries to the\r\nOhio and the Mississippi. It confirmed freedom of worship to the Roman\r\ncatholics and secured to their priests, with the exception of the\r\nreligious orders, their former tithes and dues, so far as concerned\r\ntheir own people only, for protestants were exempted from such payments.\r\nCivil cases were to be decided according to the French law, criminal\r\ncases according to the English law, by juries. It was declared\r\ninexpedient to call an assembly; a legislative council was nominated by\r\nthe crown, and taxation was reserved to the parliament of Great Britain.\r\nThe bill was strenuously opposed, Chatham in the lords, and Burke and\r\nBarre in the commons speaking strongly against it. The government, it\r\nwas urged, was setting up a despotism and was depressing the British\r\npopulation to please the French _noblesse_, and the trial of civil cases\r\nwithout juries and the withholding of the _habeas corpus_ were\r\nrepresented as intolerable grievances.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was hottest on the religious question. The whigs, who\r\nsecured the support of the dissenters by posing as the protestant party,\r\nhad a hereditary claim to the popular cry of No popery. They denounced\r\nthe bill as establishing popery, while it merely permitted\r\nprotestantism. It was, Chatham declared, a breach of the reformation, of\r\nthe revolution, and of the king's coronation oath. The City petitioned\r\nagainst the bill, and when, on June 22, the king went to give his assent\r\nto it and to prorogue parliament, he was received in the streets with\r\nangry cries of \"No popery\". The agitation soon died out, for the\r\ngovernment was popular. In America the act caused much irritation; New\r\nYork, Virginia, and other colonies complained that it deprived them of\r\nthe right to extend their territories; the revolutionary party saw with\r\nuneasiness the establishment of the power of the crown over a vast\r\ndistrict on their borders, and religious prejudices were aroused by the\r\nfavour shown to the catholics. Strong protestant as he was, the king was\r\nthoroughly in favour of the bill. It was a wise and a just measure. It\r\ngave the French Canadians all that they really needed: they thought it\r\nabsurd that rights to land should be decided by juries; they had no\r\npolitical ambitions, and only desired to enjoy in peace the\r\nministrations of their own priests and the right to deal with their\r\nlands according to their ancient customs. They rejoiced that their\r\npriests were satisfied, and in the coming struggle between Great Britain\r\nand her colonies the priests were mindful of the justice with which they\r\nwere treated and used their boundless influence with good effect on the\r\nBritish side.\r\n\r\nThe Rubicon, as Mansfield said, was passed, but the event was to be\r\ndifferent from the expectation of the king and the nation at large. When\r\nGage went out to enforce the repressive acts neither he nor those who\r\nsent him thought that his task would be hard. Four regiments, he\r\nbelieved, would be enough to settle the business. The Americans,\r\nSandwich said, were cowardly and undisciplined; they would not stand a\r\ncannon-shot. That they would not fight was the firm opinion of all but\r\na very few. More than this, it was generally expected that Massachusetts\r\nwould not be supported by the other colonies, and no special military\r\npreparation was thought necessary. On June 1, Boston harbour was closed.\r\nThe busy little town lay desolate, its wharfs were deserted, its\r\nwarehouses shut up, its streets silent; its merchants were threatened\r\nwith ruin, its seamen, shipwrights, and labourers and their families\r\nwith starvation. The act was enforced to the utmost, and small as Gage's\r\nforce was, it was sufficient to keep the town in subjection. Its\r\npunishment was heavy, but surely not heavier than its offences. Be this\r\nas it may, it was worse than ineffectual. The penal acts irritated the\r\nAmericans and did not intimidate them. Boston was regarded as suffering\r\nfor the common cause. Supplies poured in from the towns and villages of\r\nNew England, from the Carolinas, Virginia, and Maryland; and a\r\ncontinental congress was decided on. Encouraged by the prospect of\r\nsupport, the revolutionary party in Massachusetts defied Gage's\r\nauthority; gatherings of armed men took place, and warlike preparations\r\nwere set on foot. Gage began to fortify Boston Neck and brought in some\r\nguns which might otherwise have been seized by the people.\r\n\r\nOn September 5 the continental congress met at Philadelphia. Of the\r\nthirteen colonies only Georgia was unrepresented. Yet the delegates came\r\nwith different instructions and different intentions, and even among\r\ndelegates from the same province there was much difference of opinion.\r\nAs a body the congress did not meet with any predetermined revolutionary\r\npurpose. Many loyalists and indeed moderate men of both parties believed\r\nthat it would be a means of arranging a reconciliation with Great\r\nBritain, and though the most decided loyalists would have nothing to do\r\nwith it, even they hoped for a good result:[92] one-third of the\r\ndelegates, John Adams said, were whigs, one-third tories (loyalists),\r\nand the rest mongrel. A proposal for a new constitution with a president\r\nover all the colonies to be appointed by the crown, and a grand council\r\nto be elected by the several assemblies and to act in connexion with\r\nparliament, was only negatived by the votes of six colonies to five. Yet\r\nthe revolutionists gained a decided preponderance, largely through the\r\nskilful management of Samuel Adams, who persuaded the congress to\r\napprove the \"resolves\" passed at a meeting of Suffolk county,\r\nMassachusetts. These \"resolves\" rejected the act for the government of\r\nthe province, required tax collectors not to pay money into the\r\ngovernor's treasury, and advised towns to appoint their own officers of\r\nmilitia. Besides endorsing a policy of armed resistance to government,\r\ncongress further demanded the revocation of a series of acts of\r\nparliament, including the Quebec act and the late penal legislation,\r\ndrew up a declaration of rights, agreed on non-exportation and\r\nnon-importation, sent a petition to the king, and published an address\r\nto the English people. It arranged that a new congress should meet the\r\nfollowing May, and invited the Canadians to join in it, suggesting\r\ngrounds of discontent with the English government and pretending a zeal\r\nfor religious equality. But the Canadians were not to be caught.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AMERICAN LOYALISM._]\r\n\r\nCongress separated without having laid down any basis for conciliation\r\nsave complete surrender on the part of parliament, which was clearly\r\nimpossible. It professed loyalty to the crown, and it is probable that\r\ncertain eminent Americans, who, like George Washington, declared that\r\nthey knew of no wish for independence, really desired to maintain the\r\nconnexion with England, if they could bring affairs back to their\r\ncondition before 1763, and actually believed that by cutting off\r\ncommercial relations with her, they could compel her to assent to their\r\ndemands without an appeal to arms. Like the vast majority of Englishmen,\r\nwho did not believe that the Americans would fight, they failed to\r\nunderstand the situation. In the case of others, like Patrick Henry and\r\nthe Adamses, it is useless to attach any weight to loyal expressions.\r\nToo much, indeed, has been made of the American professions of loyalty,\r\nfor men's loyalty is better judged by their actions than by their words.\r\nThousands of Americans proved their loyalty by tremendous sacrifices.\r\nLoyalism on its religious side was connected with the teaching of the\r\nEnglish Church; politically it was the outcome of attachment to law,\r\nmonarchy, and the unity of the empire as against revolution, democracy,\r\nand separation.[93] The loyalists, however, included men of various\r\nreligious persuasions and of different shades of political opinion. As\r\nAmericans, they felt the British colonial system burdensome, and only\r\nthe more extreme among them approved of the stamp act and the Townshend\r\nduties. Many took the American view of the rights of the colonies; they\r\ndesired reforms and redress of grievances, and some of them were not\r\naverse from the milder forms of resistance. Yet all were loyal to the\r\ncrown and acknowledged the supremacy of parliament. The hopes of the\r\nmoderate section were disappointed by the congress of 1774; in common\r\nwith the more extreme loyalists they held that it exceeded its powers,\r\nand their denial of its authority united the loyalist party.\r\n\r\nThe loyalists, or tories as they were called, comprised, in addition to\r\nthe royal officers, many of the best and most cultivated people in the\r\ncolonies, a majority of the larger landowners, by far the greater number\r\nof the episcopal clergy together with some other religious teachers,\r\nvery many physicians, fewer lawyers, though some of the most eminent\r\namong them, and many of the wealthier merchants, who disliked the\r\ninterruption of trade and believed that its prosperity depended on\r\nBritish commerce. Among the lower classes some farmers, mechanics, and\r\nlabourers were loyalists. They were weakest in New England, though\r\nfairly numerous in Connecticut. New York was throughout the loyalist\r\nstronghold, and, of the other middle colonies, Pennsylvania was\r\ndisinclined to revolution and New Jersey contained a strong loyalist\r\nminority. In the southern colonies they were about as numerous as the\r\nwhigs, and in South Carolina and Georgia perhaps outnumbered them. John\r\nAdams, who would be inclined to underestimate their number, thought that\r\nthey were a third of the population of the thirteen colonies. The number\r\non each side fluctuated from time to time; the loyalists claimed to be\r\nin a majority, and it is probable that at least half of the most\r\nrespected part of the population were throughout the struggle either\r\navowedly or secretly averse from revolution.[94] At the lowest\r\ncomputation 20,000 loyalists joined the British army, and some thirty\r\nregiments or battalions of them were regularly organised and paid. Most\r\nof them were peaceable men, not more inclined for fighting than the\r\nmass of their opponents who were forced into war by an active minority.\r\nThrough the skilful management of this minority the loyalists were\r\ndisarmed everywhere at the beginning of the struggle. They suffered\r\nterrible persecution. A man suspected of loyalism would be summoned to a\r\nmeeting of the \"sons of liberty,\" and ordered to take an oath to them.\r\nIf he refused he was tarred and feathered, or set to ride upon a rail,\r\nand his house was defiled with filth. Loyalists were declared liable to\r\nimprisonment, exile, and confiscation. These men were not less patriotic\r\nthan the revolutionists; they believed that the welfare of their country\r\ndepended on its remaining part of the British empire; and holding this\r\nbelief they suffered, fought, and died for their country's sake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A GENERAL ELECTION._]\r\n\r\nAlthough parliament had not lasted its full term of seven years, it was\r\ndissolved on September 30. The king was probably anxious that a new\r\nparliament should be elected before any event took place which might\r\nsuggest doubt as to the success of his American policy. Besides, he was\r\nanxious to secure more men of landed property as members, and reckoned\r\nthat a sudden dissolution would foil \"the nabobs, planters, and other\r\nvolunteers,\" who would not be ready for the battle.[95] His design was\r\nsuccessful, and the election as a whole was marked by the predominance\r\nof the country gentlemen, at that period the best element in a house of\r\ncommons. Much to George's annoyance the Grenville election act had been\r\nmade perpetual during the last session. Its good effects were apparent\r\nin the election of 1774; it made the bribery of borough electors\r\ndangerous, and there was far less of it than before. Bargains, however,\r\ncould still be made with the owners and patrons of boroughs, and the\r\nking made himself responsible for the money North expended. North\r\noffered Lord Falmouth L2,500 a piece for three Cornish seats and had \"to\r\nmake it guineas\". Other bargains of the same kind were made. George, who\r\nwas great at electioneering manoeuvres, took much interest in the\r\nproceedings. He was unable to find a candidate to stand against Wilkes,\r\nthen lord mayor elect, and Wilkes and Glynn were returned for Middlesex\r\nwithout opposition. Wilkes took his seat without encountering any\r\ndifficulties and his political importance virtually ended with his\r\nexclusion. Bristol returned Burke, who was recommended to that great\r\ncommercial city by his desire for conciliation with America, and his\r\nknowledge of mercantile affairs. At the declaration of the poll he dwelt\r\non the relations which should exist between a member and his\r\nconstituents: he should, he said, as their representative in all cases\r\nprefer their interests to his own, but he should not sacrifice his\r\nmature judgment to their opinion, or be subservient to their mandates.\r\nAs a whole the election satisfied the king, for the ministers had a\r\nlarge and indeed an increased majority.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sorry,\" George wrote on hearing of the proceedings of\r\ncongress, \"that the line of conduct seems now chalked out; the New\r\nEngland colonies are in a state of rebellion, blows must decide whether\r\nthey are to be subject to this country or independent.\" He expressed the\r\nfeeling of by far the larger part of his people. Not of all, for his\r\nministers North and Dartmouth and a few of their party, were averse from\r\nviolent measures; the merchants who traded with America were anxious for\r\nconciliation; and the whigs as a body were opposed to the king's policy.\r\nChatham exulted in \"the manly wisdom and calm resolution of congress\".\r\nThe experience and sentiments of his great days led him to foresee that,\r\nin case of war France and Spain would seize the opportunity of attacking\r\nEngland. Unfortunately his theory that the colonies owed only a limited\r\nobedience to the crown, that while parliament had a right to crush\r\ndisobedience and to pass acts regulating trade, it had no right to\r\nimpose taxes, his violence, his inveterate habit of \"talking\r\nfustian,\"[96] and his friendship with Franklin, who was commonly\r\nregarded as a rebel, deprived his warnings of the weight which they\r\ndeserved. The Rockingham party did not act cordially with him. It was\r\ninspired by Burke who urged that parliament should disregard the\r\nquestion of right, should act in accordance with the spirit rather than\r\nthe letter of the constitution, should respect a desire for free\r\ninstitutions, and should be guided by what was practicable and what was\r\nadvisable, specially with reference to England's trade. His influence\r\nwas somewhat injured by the fact that since 1771 he had been the paid\r\nagent of the province of New York. Equally with Chatham, he considered\r\nthat colonial trade and industry should be restrained in order to bring\r\nwealth to the mother-country, nor does either of them seem to have\r\nperceived that the root of American discontent lay in these\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CRISIS UNDER-ESTIMATED._]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1776 that Adam Smith in his famous _Wealth of Nations_\r\nshowed that such restrictions were actually injurious to the prosperity\r\nof the country which imposed them, and combated the theories on which\r\nthe relations of England with her colonies had been built up. He desired\r\nthat the colonies should be represented in parliament, a proposal which\r\nfound some advocates both here and in America, but was condemned by\r\nBurke and did not enter into practical politics. Meanwhile a pamphleteer\r\nof originality and genius, Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, maintained that\r\nseparation was inevitable and advisable, that the Americans were a\r\nturbulent and ill-conditioned people, a source of expense to which they\r\nwould not contribute, and that England would be better off without them.\r\nShe would not, he contended, lose commercially; for, like Adam Smith, he\r\npointed out that trade goes to the best market, and that so long as\r\nEngland remained superior to other countries in capital and industry,\r\nshe would keep the American trade, and, as war was destructive of trade,\r\nhe would have had her separate herself peacefully from her rebellious\r\ncolonies. His proposal was denounced by Burke and found no acceptance\r\nwith either party in England.\r\n\r\nNumerically weak as the opposition in parliament was, it made a vigorous\r\nfight over American affairs. Parliament opened on November 30, and the\r\nking's speech took note of the resistance to the law which prevailed in\r\nMassachusetts, and the \"unwarrantable combinations for the obstruction\"\r\nof trade. In both houses an amendment to the address was proposed. The\r\ndivisions illustrate the strength of the two parties; in the lords it\r\nwas defeated by 63 to 13, and in the commons by 264 to 73. The ministers\r\nasserted that the force already in America was sufficient to bring the\r\ncolonies to obedience; the naval establishment was reduced to a peace\r\nfooting, and no extra soldiers were voted. Gage, however, who had only\r\nsome 3,000 troops, asked for a large reinforcement, and wrote that, if\r\nmatters came to an extremity, 20,000 men would be needed for the\r\nconquest of New England, a number which, Dartmouth said, \"the nation\r\nwould not be able to furnish in a twelvemonth\".[97] The ministers\r\nresolved to send a small reinforcement from Ireland, they were\r\nencouraged to believe that the Americans would yield by tidings that the\r\nNew York assembly had rejected the decisions of congress and by more\r\nhopeful news from Gage. After the recess the campaign opened in earnest.\r\nOn January 20, 1775, Chatham moved for the recall of the troops from\r\nBoston, and declared that, if the ministers persisted in their policy,\r\nthey would mislead the king and the kingdom would be undone. He was\r\ndefeated by a large majority. Petitions against coercion were presented\r\nfrom London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow, and other trading towns, and\r\nwere virtually shelved. Meanwhile Lord Howe, encouraged by the dislike\r\nof North and Dartmouth to coercive measures, made ineffectual attempts\r\nto arrange terms of conciliation through Franklin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONCILIATORY RESOLUTIONS._]\r\n\r\nOn February 1 Chatham, who was in constant communication with Franklin,\r\nbrought in a conciliation bill. It was a strange composition, florid in\r\nterms, embracing a multiplicity of subjects, and depending for its\r\noperation on the good-will of the Americans. He proposed to assert the\r\nsupremacy of parliament, specially in matters of trade, to confine\r\ntaxation to the provincial assemblies, and to legalise the coming\r\ncongress in order that it might make a perpetual free grant to the\r\ncrown, which was to be appropriated by parliament to the reduction of\r\nthe national debt. Having obtained this grant, parliament was to reduce\r\nthe power of the admiralty courts, which checked illicit trading, and to\r\nsuspend all the acts, including the Quebec act, of which the Americans\r\ncomplained. The bill was not allowed a second reading. Soon after its\r\nignominious rejection the gout laid hold on Chatham, and he did not\r\nappear in parliament again for two years. Franklin returned to America\r\nabout this time; he disclaimed responsibility for Chatham's proposals,\r\nwhich, he considered, would only have been useful as a basis for future\r\narrangement. North at last informed parliament of the threatening state\r\nof affairs. Massachusetts was declared in rebellion; votes were passed\r\nfor 2,000 additional seamen and about 4,400 soldiers; it was resolved to\r\nincrease the force at Boston to 10,000 men; and a bill was passed\r\nconfining the commerce of the New England provinces to Great Britain\r\nand the West Indies, and shutting them out from the Newfoundland\r\nfishery. These restraints, which were evoked by the American\r\nnon-intercourse agreements, were soon extended to five other provinces.\r\n\r\nWhile George promoted these strong measures, he willingly fell in with\r\nNorth's desire to \"hold out the olive-branch\"; and on the 20th North\r\nmoved a resolution to the effect that if any colony provided what\r\nparliament considered its fair proportion towards the common defence and\r\nthe expenses of its civil administration, no duty or tax should be\r\nimposed upon it, except for the regulation of trade. His proposal\r\nexcited the indignation of the high prerogative party, who thought\r\nthemselves betrayed; his followers rose in revolt; \"the treasury bench\r\nseemed to totter\". The storm was stilled at last, and then Barre, Burke,\r\nand Dunning fell upon the bill, describing it as a mean attempt to\r\ndivide the Americans, and a plan for coercing each province separately.\r\nThe motion was, however, carried. As the opposition scorned North's\r\nplan, which Burke called \"a project of ransom by auction,\" it behoved\r\nthem to bring forward a plan of their own which would be acceptable to\r\nthe Americans. Accordingly, on March 22, Burke propounded a series of\r\nconciliatory resolutions which he enforced in one of his most famous\r\nspeeches. He urged the house to return to its old policy, to respect the\r\nAmericans' love of freedom, to look to the colonial assemblies to supply\r\nthe expenses of their government and defence, to abandon the futile\r\nattempt to impose taxation, and to extend to Americans the privileges of\r\nEnglishmen. His proposal was defeated. Nevertheless, by accepting\r\nNorth's resolution parliament showed a desire for pacification. The\r\nresolution proposed a compromise; while it maintained the authority of\r\nparliament, it offered the Americans self-taxation. It was made with a\r\nsincere desire to end the quarrel. At one time it might have led to\r\npacification, but it came too late.\r\n\r\nGage found the fortification of Boston Neck no easy matter; the people\r\nwould not sell him materials, and somehow his barges sank, his waggons\r\nwere bogged, and their loads caught fire. The work was finished at last,\r\nand with his small force he could do little else. In Rhode Island the\r\npeople seized the cannon mounted for the defence of the harbour, and in\r\nNew Hampshire they surprised a small fort, and carried off ordnance and\r\nstores. Manufactories of arms and powder-mills were set up in different\r\nplaces. In February, 1775, the Massachusetts provincial congress met,\r\nand urged the militia, and specially the \"minute-men\"--militiamen ready\r\nto serve on the shortest notice--to perfect their discipline. Virginia,\r\nMaryland, and the Carolinas were astir with warlike preparations; in\r\nMassachusetts men were practising the use of arms on every village\r\ngreen, a number of Stockbridge Indians were enlisted as minute-men, and\r\nefforts were made to induce the Six Nations to \"whet the hatchet\"\r\nagainst the English.[98] Express-riders kept the country people well\r\nsupplied with intelligence, in order that they might anticipate any\r\nprojected movement of the British troops. On the 26th Gage sent a\r\ndetachment to Salem to bring in some guns, but the people removed them\r\nin time. Some opposition was offered to the troops, but they were kept\r\nwell in hand and no blood was shed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SKIRMISH AT LEXINGTON._]\r\n\r\nHe determined to be beforehand at Concord, where the provincials had\r\ngathered a quantity of military stores, and on April 18 sent some\r\ncompanies of grenadiers and light infantry under Colonel Smith and Major\r\nPitcairn to destroy them. They went by night up the Charles river in\r\nboats, landed, and began their march. The alarm had been given and the\r\ncountry was aroused. When they arrived at Lexington at 5 in the morning\r\nof the 19th they found a body of militia on the green. \"Disperse, you\r\nrebels!\" shouted Pitcairn, and the troops advanced with a cheer. As the\r\nmilitia dispersed some shots were fired. From which side the first shot\r\ncame is not clear. A soldier was hit and Pitcairn's horse was wounded.\r\nThe troops fired a volley, a few militiamen were killed and others\r\nwounded, and the soldiers marched on. While the grenadiers were\r\ndestroying the stores at Concord a sharp engagement took place with the\r\nmilitia, and several on both sides were killed and wounded. The troops,\r\nhaving accomplished their purpose as far as was possible, for part of\r\nthe stores had already been removed, set out to return to Boston. As\r\nthey marched back, tired and impeded by their wounded, militiamen and\r\nvolunteers fired upon them from every hedge, and wall, and house, and\r\nthe shots told heavily on their close ranks. Forced on by the ceaseless\r\nfire, like a driven flock of sheep, thick together and helpless, they\r\nstaggered back to Lexington, where they arrived completely exhausted.\r\nThere they were met by a large detachment under Lord Percy, which had\r\nbeen sent to their relief. After a rest the whole body marched back,\r\nharassed all the way by an incessant fire from cover, which they were\r\nfor the most part unable to return. The British loss was sixty-five\r\nkilled, about 157 wounded, and a few missing; the American casualties\r\nare stated as ninety-three in all. Not, unhappily, for the last time did\r\nour soldiers find that farmers and the like, who know their country, are\r\naccustomed to shoot, and understand the importance of taking cover, may\r\nbe more than a match for brave and disciplined soldiers with no\r\nknowledge of war save the drill of a parade ground. It was evident that\r\nthere was fighting stuff in the Americans, that they had some good\r\nmarksmen, and that, undisciplined as they were, like the Boers of our\r\nown day, they knew how to use such advantages as they possessed.\r\n\r\nThus was the first blood shed in this long quarrel. The revolution was\r\nbegun. Sooner or later it must have come, though the date of its coming\r\nand the violent means by which it was accomplished were decided by\r\nindividual action. The spirit which underlay it can be traced with\r\ngrowing distinctness since 1690; it was a spirit of independence,\r\npuritan in religion and republican in politics, impatient of control,\r\nself-assertive, and disposed to opposition. It was irritated by\r\nrestraints on industry and commerce, and found opportunities for\r\nexpression in a system which gave the colonies representative assemblies\r\nwhile it withheld rights of self-government. Great Britain has since\r\nthen adopted a more enlightened colonial policy; yet the statesmen of\r\npast times are not to be condemned because they were men of their own\r\ndays and lacked the experience of a future age. And it is to be\r\nremembered that England's colonial policy was then, as it is now, the\r\nmost liberal in the world. American discontent existed before the reign\r\nof George III.; it was kept in check by the fear of French invasion. It\r\nwas when that fear was removed that England began to enforce the\r\nrestraints on commerce. This change in policy fell most heavily on the\r\nNew England provinces, where whig tendencies were strongest, and\r\nspecially on Massachusetts. A small and violent party in the province\r\nfanned the flame of discontent, and the attempts at taxation, which\r\nadded to the grievances of the colonists, afforded a respectable cry to\r\nthe fomenters of resistance. Their work was aided by the apprehension\r\naroused in the minds of their fellow-countrymen, by the increase in the\r\npart played by the prerogative, and by the predominance of the tories in\r\nEngland. While men in other provinces, as Patrick Henry in Virginia,\r\nworked in sympathy with Samuel Adams and his associates, the revolution\r\nwas at its outset engineered at Boston, and was immediately determined\r\nby the quarrel between Great Britain and Massachusetts. In the events\r\nwhich led to the revolution the British government appears to have shown\r\na short-sighted insistence on legal rights and a contemptuous disregard\r\nof the sentiments and opinions of the colonists; the revolutionists\r\ngenerally a turbulent, insolent, and unreasonable temper.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] Franklin, _Works_, v., 189-90, 205-7, 305-14, ed.

The provincial assembly voted that\r\nan army of 30,000 men should be raised in New England, fixed on\r\nCambridge as its headquarters and sent to their neighbours for support.\r\nFrom New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island the answer was prompt.\r\nNumerous bands of volunteers marched to join the forces of\r\nMassachusetts, and an army of 16,000 men soon invested Boston from the\r\nMystic river to Roxbury. It was an army without unity, for the troops of\r\neach colony acted under their own leaders; and its numbers varied from\r\nday to day, the Massachusetts volunteers, who formed its principal part,\r\ntaking leave of absence whenever they chose. Many of the provincials had\r\nseen service against the French, and understood a soldier's work, and\r\nmany more had received some training in the militia, but the mass of the\r\nvolunteers had no military experience or discipline. Yet they were men\r\nwell used to shoot and to handle the spade and axe, implements of\r\nfirst-rate importance in war; they belonged as a whole to a higher class\r\nthan the privates of the British army, they were more resourceful and\r\nintelligent, and were able to obtain provisions and other supplies\r\nwithout difficulty. Such as they were, Gage judged them too formidable\r\nin number for him to attack. The neck of land which joins Boston to the\r\ncontinent had been fortified so strongly that the provincials could not\r\nhope to storm it, and he decided to remain behind it and await the\r\narrival of the reinforcements which were already on their way. He made\r\nno effort to prevent the insurgents from shutting up his army on the\r\nlandward side, and early in May they began to form entrenchments. At the\r\nsame time they took measures to distress the beleaguered force by\r\nclearing off the live-stock, hay, and other supplies from the islands in\r\nthe harbour. Gage tried in vain to stop them, and there were several\r\nskirmishes in the harbour, in which the British suffered more heavily\r\nthan the provincials.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents were not content with fighting on their own ground. The\r\ncommand of the line of the Hudson would prevent the British from cutting\r\noff New England from the middle colonies, would secure New York from\r\nattack from the north, and would open a way for an invasion of Canada.\r\nOn the north the approaches to the river were dominated by the forts of\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point, which had played a conspicuous part in the\r\ngreat war with France; and in them were laid up some 200 cannon, small\r\narms, and other military stores. Important as these forts were, no\r\nadequate garrisons were maintained in them. Benedict Arnold, the leader\r\nof a band of volunteers from New Haven, Connecticut, a druggist and West\r\nIndia trader, was informed of their defenceless condition, and made an\r\noffer to the Massachusetts committee of safety to capture them. His\r\noffer was accepted, and he was authorised to raise a force. The same\r\nplan had been formed in Connecticut; and Ethan Allen, the leader of an\r\nassociation in Vermont, was sent with his followers to carry it out.\r\nArnold met him on the march; he refused to yield the command, and Arnold\r\njoined his force, which included a body of Indians. At dawn on May 10\r\nthey surprised the garrison of Ticonderoga, consisting of less than\r\nfifty men, and compelled the governor to surrender without striking a\r\nblow. A detachment from the force seized Crown Point, and a few days\r\nlater Arnold sailed down Lake Champlain and captured St. John's, which\r\nwas recovered by the British in the course of the summer and garrisoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPINION IN ENGLAND._]\r\n\r\nIn England the news of the fighting at Lexington and Concord was\r\nreceived with astonishment. People were by no means distressed, for they\r\nbelieved that Gage would soon take his revenge. Military men were\r\npuzzled and provoked at the state of affairs at Boston. \"How often,\"\r\nsaid a general at the war office to one who had held command in America,\r\n\"have I heard you American colonels boast that with four battalions you\r\nwould march through America, and now you think that Gage with 4,000 men\r\nand forty pieces of cannon mayn't venture out of Boston.\"[99] However,\r\nthings would, it was expected, soon wear a different face, for about\r\n5,500 men were on their way to Boston, and three new generals had\r\nembarked on April 21 to serve under Gage. They were Howe, a younger\r\nbrother of Lord Howe, the admiral, a fine gentleman and a gallant\r\nsoldier, reputed to be a left-handed cousin of the king through his\r\nmother, a daughter of the Countess of Darlington, a mistress of George\r\nI., kindly, careless, and frivolous, who had distinguished himself at\r\nthe taking of Quebec; Clinton, who had served in Germany; and Burgoyne,\r\nwho had made a successful campaign in Portugal under Lippe Buckeburg, a\r\nman of fashion, a dramatist, a politician, and a keen soldier, eager for\r\nemployment and promotion. North and Dartmouth were vexed at the news of\r\nthe encounter, for they had entertained strong hopes, expressed by the\r\nking in closing parliament on May 26, that the conciliation bill would\r\nlead to a pacification. Gage's attempt at Concord was, Dartmouth said,\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nThe whigs were dismayed, for they did not share the confidence of the\r\nnation at large. Though Burke expected that the Americans would suffer\r\n\"some heavy blows,\" he did not believe that a war with them would be\r\nended quickly; and Richmond thought it probable that America would be\r\nlost and \"with it our trade and opulence\".[100] In England every war\r\ngives an opportunity to some vain and foolish persons for condemning\r\ntheir own country and showing sympathy with its enemies. So it was in\r\n1775. Wilkes, then lord mayor, and the livery of the city tried to force\r\nthe king to receive on the throne a petition which declared that an\r\nattempt was being made to establish arbitrary power in America. They\r\nwere foiled by the king and adopted an address expressed in more decent\r\nterms, to which he returned answer that so long as constitutional\r\nauthority was resisted he would continue to maintain it by force. The\r\nconstitutional society, of which Horne was the leading spirit, sent\r\nFranklin L100 for, as Horne wrote in the _Evening Post_, \"the widows and\r\norphans of our beloved American fellow-subjects inhumanly murdered by\r\nthe king's troops at or near Lexington and Concord\". Horne was indicted\r\nfor this libel in 1777, and was sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a\r\nfine of L200.\r\n\r\nIn America the news of the affair at Lexington called forth in every\r\ncolony a spirit of union, a determination to stand by their New England\r\nbrethren. No answers were sent to North's conciliatory proposals; all\r\nalike agreed in referring them to the continental congress. This was\r\nequivalent to a rejection of them, for it was well known that the\r\nBritish government would hold no communication with that body. The\r\ncongress met for the second time at Philadelphia on May 10. It rejected\r\nNorth's proposals and agreed that garrisons should be maintained at\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point, a decision which implied an approval of the\r\noffensive war levied against the king in the expedition against those\r\nforts. As, however, it was expedient to lull the suspicions of the\r\nFrench Canadians, who were not likely to have forgotten the religious\r\nbitterness exhibited by the Americans with reference to the Quebec act,\r\nit declared that no invasion of Canada would be made. The congress\r\nassumed executive powers; in the name of the \"United Colonies\" it\r\nadopted the army of New England then before Boston as the continental\r\narmy, took measures for its organisation and payment, authorised a loan,\r\nand on June 15 chose George Washington, the colonel of the Virginia\r\nmilitia, as commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nNo wiser choice could have been made. Washington was a gentleman of\r\nVirginia, of independent fortune, descended from an English family of\r\ngood position; he had served with distinction against the French, and as\r\naide-de-camp to Braddock had behaved with remarkable intrepidity in the\r\nbattle on the Monongahela river in 1755. Thoroughly unselfish, he\r\ndevoted himself with all his heart to public duty; his integrity was\r\nabove suspicion; he was free from personal ambition, and was never\r\nswayed by jealousy. His education had been neglected, but his intellect\r\nwas clear and his judgment sound. He was naturally hot-tempered, and\r\nwhen his anger was roused he was a terror to evil-doers, to the officer\r\nwho disobeyed his orders and to the rascally contractor who supplied his\r\narmy with inferior stores. Yet he habitually kept his temper under\r\ncontrol. Steadfast in purpose, he was never overwhelmed by misfortune\r\nand never yielded to factious opposition. And strong as his will was, it\r\ndid not degenerate into obstinacy; he would gladly listen to the advice\r\nof others, and in military matters was sometimes too ready to act upon\r\nit. At first he made mistakes in generalship, but his military skill\r\ngrew with his experience. In army administration he was excellent; his\r\nindustry was unwearying; the smallest details received his personal\r\nattention. He was conscious of the difficulties of the task which lay\r\nbefore him; he believed, so he told Patrick Henry, that from the day of\r\nhis appointment his reputation would begin to decline. The congress was\r\nan unorganised body without any constitutional status, conducting its\r\nbusiness by means of constantly changing and irresponsible committees,\r\nand was utterly unfit to exercise executive functions; it had no means\r\nof enforcing its decrees, no revenue, and no munitions of war. The army\r\nwhich it adopted was little better than an assembly of armed men; many\r\nwere volunteers, and it was decided to enlist men only for seven months.\r\nThere was little discipline; the officers were for the most part\r\nignorant of their duties and were of the same social standing as their\r\nmen; and the New England privates, self-opiniated and obstinate, showed\r\nlittle respect for their orders. Washington had not merely to command an\r\narmy in the field, he had to create one and, what was harder still, to\r\nkeep it together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SIEGE OF BOSTON._]\r\n\r\nInside Boston life was by no means pleasant. All marketing from the\r\ncountry was at an end, for the town was closely beset by land and the\r\nislands were cleared of provisions; no fresh meat was to be had, and the\r\nbesieged lived alternately on salt beef and salt pork. Attacks from\r\nfire-rafts and whale-boats were daily threatened, and fears were\r\nentertained that the inhabitants might set fire to the town in order to\r\nforce the British to leave it.[101] On May 25 the three new generals\r\nlanded, and the arrival of the reinforcements raised the number of\r\nGage's army to about 10,000 men. Believing that the rebellion would soon\r\nbe quelled, he issued a foolish proclamation, offering pardon to all\r\nrebels who laid down their arms, except Samuel Adams and Hancock, then\r\npresident of the congress, and threatening those who continued in arms\r\nwith punishment as traitors. As the insurgents had no ships, while the\r\nBritish had floating batteries and ships of war in the harbour, they\r\ncould not hope to destroy Gage's army, or reduce it to surrender through\r\nfamine. Their object was to compel him to evacuate the place and sail\r\noff. The peninsula on which the town stands was commanded by hills both\r\non the north and south-east. On the north were the hills of the\r\nCharlestown peninsula, which was separated from Boston by the Charles\r\nriver; it had the Mystic river on its northern side, and was joined to\r\nthe mainland by a narrow neck. On the south-east it was commanded by the\r\nhills of another peninsula called Dorchester Neck. A battery on either\r\nthe Charlestown hills or the Dorchester heights would have rendered\r\nGage's position untenable; for, independently of any loss which his\r\ntroops might sustain from bombardment, the British shipping would be\r\ndrawn from its anchorage, and if he remained he would be practically\r\nimprisoned in the town and cut off from supplies. It should therefore\r\nhave been Gage's first care to shut the insurgents out from those\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had not attempted to occupy the hills on either side, but\r\nafter the arrival of the new generals it was decided to include them\r\nwithin the lines. On June 13 the insurgents heard that the British were\r\nabout to occupy Dorchester heights. They determined to frustrate this\r\nmove by occupying the ridge stretching along the Charlestown peninsula,\r\nand called by the general name of Bunker hill. Accordingly on the\r\nevening of the 16th a detachment of 1,200 men, with six field-pieces,\r\nwas sent from Cambridge for that purpose. When they arrived at the\r\nsummit their leaders determined to advance farther and to fortify a\r\nlower eminence of the ridge nearer Boston, which was distinguished by\r\nthe name of Breeds hill. There during the night they formed a redoubt\r\nand breastwork. At daybreak on the 17th they were discovered from the\r\nsloop _Lively_, and her guns roused the British army. Before long a\r\nbattery in Boston and the guns of other ships opened fire, but did\r\nlittle mischief. The insurgents received a small reinforcement, and\r\nformed a line of defence, protected by a low wall and rail, from their\r\nredoubt northward to the Mystic, in order to secure themselves from a\r\nflank attack. If Gage had placed a floating battery on the Mystic, which\r\nwould have taken them on the left flank, and had landed troops to the\r\nrear of the redoubt, held the neck, and so cut them off from their main\r\nbody, he would have had them at his mercy. This would have been easy,\r\nfor by taking up a more advanced position than was laid down in their\r\norders, they left their rear exposed to attack. He decided, however, to\r\nstorm their works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL._]\r\n\r\nNot till midday did a detachment of British troops, grenadiers and light\r\ninfantry, begin to land on the peninsula under the command of Howe and\r\nPigot. They waited for reinforcements, which brought their number up to\r\nover 2,000 men, with artillery. Hot as the weather was, the men were\r\nburdened with knapsacks containing provisions for three days. At 3 P.M.\r\nthey advanced in two divisions, the light infantry under Howe against\r\nthe line of defence, the grenadiers under Pigot against the redoubt. At\r\nfirst their advance was covered by their artillery, but the guns stuck\r\nin the mire, and it is said that a fresh supply of ball sent from Boston\r\nwas too large for the cannon. Even if this was the case, it could have\r\nmade no difference, for the supply taken with the guns was not\r\nexhausted.[102] Up the steep hill, through long tangled grass, the\r\nred-coats toiled on towards the redoubt, each burdened with a weight of\r\nsome 125 pounds. With admirable coolness the Americans held their fire\r\nuntil the enemy was about fifty yards from them, and then poured a\r\nvolley into their ranks. For a few minutes the men stood steady and\r\nreturned the fire, then they turned and retreated in disorder. The\r\nattack on the fence was equally unsuccessful. While the officers were\r\nrallying their men, the battery on Cops hill burnt the wooden houses of\r\nthe almost deserted village of Charlestown, from which the troops had\r\nbeen fired upon as they advanced. Then a second attack was made, and\r\nagain the British were sent staggering back by the enemy's fire. At this\r\ncrisis Clinton came over from Boston, took command of two battalions, a\r\nbody of marines, and the 47th, and did good service in helping to rally\r\nthe troops. With fine persistency they made ready for a third attack.\r\nMore rational orders were given; the force was not divided, and only a\r\nfeint was made against the line of defence, the men laid aside their\r\nknapsacks, advanced in column against the redoubt, and attacked with the\r\nbayonet. The Americans, who had received little support of any kind from\r\nheadquarters, were weary, and their ammunition was almost exhausted;\r\nthey were driven from their works and retreated across the neck. Their\r\nretreat was covered with bravery and military skill[103] by the body\r\nstationed along the line of defence on their left, but as they passed\r\nover the neck they suffered severely from the guns of the _Glasgow_\r\nsloop of war. Howe would not pursue them, and at once began to fortify\r\nthe peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe victory was decisive, for it gave the English the ground for which\r\nthey fought, and enabled them to hold Boston for nine months longer. It\r\nwas dearly purchased by the loss of 19 officers and 207 men killed, and\r\n70 officers and 758 men wounded, making a total of 1,054 casualties, an\r\nextraordinarily large proportion of the number engaged, apparently about\r\n2,500. This was the natural result of sending troops up a hill to\r\ndeliver a frontal attack on an earthwork held by a body of men well used\r\nto shoot. It will be observed that the loss of officers was extremely\r\nheavy; they fearlessly exposed themselves, as the British officer always\r\ndoes, in order to encourage their men. The Americans, who for the most\r\npart fought behind cover, stated their loss at 449. After Bunker hill,\r\nno one whose judgment was not warped by prejudice could believe that the\r\nAmericans were cowards. They were not, so Gage wrote, the disorderly\r\nrabble too many have supposed; he had seen enough to convince him that\r\nthe conquest of the country could only be effected by perseverance and\r\nstrong armies.[104] The behaviour of the insurgent troops greatly\r\nencouraged their party. When Washington heard how they had fought he\r\ndeclared that the liberties of the country were safe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INVASION OF CANADA._]\r\n\r\nAlready some colonies were making temporary arrangements for popular\r\ngovernment and issuing bills for the expenses of defence, and in July\r\nGeorgia expressed its adherence to the general policy of armed\r\nresistance. For a while, however, royal governors still remained, and\r\ngovernment was everywhere in a chaotic state. In New York the mob\r\ncommitted many outrages on the persons and property of loyalists, and\r\nhostilities took place with crews of the king's ships in the bay. Yet\r\nthe town was not prepared to take a decided part; and it received Tryon,\r\nthe royal governor, and Washington with the same tokens of respect. A\r\nlike incongruity marked the proceedings of congress. Besides adopting\r\naddresses to the people of Great Britain and Ireland, it sent a petition\r\nto the king on whom it was levying war from his \"faithful subjects,\"\r\nexpressing attachment to his \"person, family, and government\" and\r\nbeseeching him to \"settle peace\". At the same time, in spite of its\r\ndeclaration to the contrary, it ordered an invasion of Canada. The\r\nAmericans flattered themselves that the Canadians would rise against the\r\nBritish, and Allen, puffed up by his recent success, made a dash at\r\nMontreal with only 150 men. He was defeated and taken prisoner.\r\nMeanwhile Montgomery started from Ticonderoga in August with over 2,000\r\nmen, captured Chamblee, where he found a good supply of military stores,\r\nand laid siege to St. John's. Canada was practically defenceless, for\r\nCarleton had only 900 regular troops; the English-speaking Canadians\r\nwere disaffected, the French for the most part either apathetic or\r\nhostile. He sent to Gage for reinforcements, but the admiral, Samuel\r\nGraves, declined to transport troops to Quebec, for as it was then late\r\nin October the voyage from Boston would have been dangerous. Carleton's\r\nefforts to relieve St. John's were unsuccessful, and after a stout\r\nresistance the garrison surrendered on November 13. The fall of St.\r\nJohn's involved the surrender of Montreal, which was defenceless, and\r\nCarleton hastened to the defence of Quebec.\r\n\r\nHis presence was needed there, for on September 13 a detachment of about\r\n1,500 men under the command of Arnold was sent from the army at\r\nCambridge to surprise and capture the city. It was to proceed by land\r\nand water up the Kennebec, and down the Chaudiere to the St. Lawrence.\r\nThe route, though used by trappers and Indians, was dimly traced, and\r\nthe equipment of the expedition was too cumbersome for the rough work\r\nwhich lay before it.[105] Soon after leaving their transports at Fort\r\nWestern, where, fifty-eight miles from its mouth, the Kennebec ceased to\r\nbe navigable except by _bateaux_, the troops began to suffer great\r\nhardships. Their stores were conveyed in _bateaux_, which they were\r\nconstantly forced to haul against currents and carry over land. Many of\r\nthem leaked, some were abandoned, and provisions ran short. The weather\r\nbecame cold and rainy. The whole rear division, with its officers, lost\r\nheart and turned back, taking with them a large share of food and\r\nammunition. The rest toiled on through swamps and mire, half-starved and\r\nbenumbed with cold. Many perished, some lost their way, and the men of\r\none company were reduced to eating their dogs and gnawing the leather of\r\ntheir shoes. It was not until November 9 that Arnold's troops, a ragged\r\nand shivering crowd of about 600 men, with some Indians who had joined\r\nthem, reached Point Levi. Montgomery, who was to have met them, was not\r\nthere; they crossed the St. Lawrence, and Arnold sent an absurd summons\r\nto the garrison of Quebec. He then retreated to Pointe-aux-Trembles to\r\nwait for Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe defences of Quebec were in bad condition, the garrison was small,\r\nand there was much disaffection among the inhabitants. The whole country\r\nwas in the power of the invaders, the people were on their side, and it\r\nseemed as though the hopes of the Americans would be fulfilled. But\r\nwhile Quebec remained untaken, Canada would still be unconquered, and\r\nthe defence was in good hands. The garrison was commanded by Colonel\r\nMaclean of the 84th, or Royal Highland Emigrants, a regiment largely\r\nraised by him from Frazer's Highlanders who had done good service under\r\nWolfe. Carleton soon entered the place, and while Arnold was waiting for\r\nMontgomery, took vigorous measures for securing its safety. Montgomery\r\narrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles on December 1, and on the night of the\r\n31st the rebels attempted to carry Quebec by storm. They were repulsed\r\nwith heavy loss, Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded. They\r\ncontinued the siege, but were too weak either to invest the city\r\ncompletely or make any offensive movement. Carleton waited quietly until\r\nthe breaking up of the ice should allow reinforcements to come up the\r\nriver. Before long the French Canadians began to transfer their\r\nsympathies to the British. Their priests were too well satisfied with\r\nthe Quebec act to desire change. Bishop Briand published a _mandement_,\r\nreminding his people of the benefits they received from English rule and\r\ncalling upon them to defend their province. His exhortation had a\r\npowerful effect, for priests refused to confess men who joined the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PAUCITY OF THE BRITISH ARMY._]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Bunker hill made no change in the position of Gage's\r\narmy, which suffered from the want of wholesome food and from other\r\nprivations. As England had command of the sea the troops could have been\r\nremoved, and the generals wrote to the government suggesting that Boston\r\nshould be evacuated and the royal forces concentrated at New York,\r\nwhich was more open to communication by sea, and in every respect a\r\nbetter base for future operations. The government, however, was\r\nunwilling to give up the town, and things remained as they were, for the\r\ngenerals considered that nothing was to be gained by an attack on the\r\nenemy's lines, because their army was not supplied with the materials\r\nnecessary to move at a distance. Plans were indeed proposed for\r\nembarrassing the enemy by sending out a detachment to make a descent on\r\nRhode Island;[106] but Gage did nothing, and the government, convinced\r\nof his incapacity, recalled him to England. He sailed from Boston in\r\nOctober, and Howe was appointed to the chief command. By sea there was\r\nas little done as by land, for the naval force under Graves was so\r\ninefficient that he was unable even to prevent the whale-boats of the\r\nrebels from intercepting supplies and destroying lighthouses. He was\r\nunjustly blamed for inaction, both by the army in Boston and the\r\ngovernment. His removal was, the king thought, \"as necessary as the mild\r\ngeneral's\".[107] This and every other matter connected with the war was\r\ndirected by the king. His industry and his knowledge of details,\r\nmilitary and naval, were extraordinary, and North, Dartmouth, and\r\nBarrington, whatever their own opinions were, had no choice but to carry\r\nout his orders.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the war the army of Great Britain was on its normal\r\npeace establishment of about 17,000 men, besides the Irish army of\r\n15,235, the garrison of Gibraltar 3,500, and of Minorca 2,500. It was an\r\namazingly small number, considering the accessions made to the empire by\r\nthe late war. George always wished for a larger permanent force; but his\r\nministers shrank from raising a storm by increasing the estimates or\r\nprovoking the popular jealousy of a standing army. Men were wanted at\r\nonce. The first reinforcements were obtained from Ireland, and the Irish\r\nparliament agreed that 4,000 men should be drafted out of the country\r\nbeyond the number allowed by statute. It soon became evident that the\r\nwar required the immediate supply of a far greater number of men than\r\ncould be spared from the present establishment or could be raised\r\nquickly. Parliament was not in session, and the king determined to\r\nobtain the services of foreign troops. As Elector of Hanover he lent\r\n2,355 Hanoverians to garrison Gibraltar and Minorca, and so set a\r\ncorresponding number of the British garrisons free to be employed in the\r\nwar. He sought to hire men from other sovereigns. A proposal made to\r\nCatherine of Russia for the hire of 20,000 men was scornfully declined,\r\nand the States-General refused to sell him their Scots brigade. With the\r\npetty princes of Germany he was more lucky; the Duke of Brunswick, the\r\nLandgrave and the hereditary Prince of Hesse Cassel, and the Prince of\r\nWaldeck were happy to sell their subjects, and agreed to supply 17,742\r\nin return for a liberal payment. These arrangements enraged the\r\nAmericans, who spoke of them as though the king was delivering a loyal\r\npeople to be massacred by foreign mercenaries. As a matter of fact they\r\nwere making war on the king, and he had as good a right to buy troops to\r\nfight in his quarrel as he had to buy cannon. It is on the princes who\r\nsold the blood of their subjects that the disgrace of these transactions\r\nmust rest. Frederick of Prussia expressed his disgust at their\r\ngreediness in bitter terms, and is said to have jeeringly declared that\r\nwhen any of the unfortunate men whose lives they were selling passed\r\nthrough his dominions he would levy toll on them at so much a head as\r\nthough they were cattle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVACUATION OF BOSTON._]\r\n\r\nNothing was gained by the recall of Gage, for Howe was equally\r\nincompetent. Privateers were fitted out in great number in the New\r\nEngland ports, which did mischief to English commerce and intercepted\r\nthe supplies sent out to the army. In order to check this privateering\r\nbusiness two ships-of-war sailed from Boston in October, under a\r\nlieutenant named Mowat, with orders to burn the shipping along the\r\ncoast. Mowat exceeded his orders and destroyed the town of Falmouth.\r\nThis useless act of barbarity, which excited violent indignation among\r\nthe Americans, was reprehended by the British government. In Boston\r\nsickness continued rife among the troops, and in November there was an\r\noutbreak of small-pox. Washington, however, was not in a position to\r\nattack; he had great difficulty in obtaining ammunition and not less in\r\nraising men. The revolutionary spirit was spreading, but there was\r\nlittle military ardour. In December the period of enlistment ended; his\r\narmy was disbanded, and he could not obtain quite 10,000 men to take\r\nits place. Though Howe's army was weakened by sickness, such effective\r\ntroops as he had were well-trained soldiers. Yet he made no attempt to\r\nforce the American lines. By the beginning of March Washington was able\r\nto take the offensive, and on the night of the 4th occupied Dorchester\r\nheights and began to plant cannon there. It is amazing that Howe should\r\nhave neglected this important position. A storm prevented him from\r\nsending a force across the bay to attack the Americans' works before\r\nthey were completed; their batteries rendered Boston untenable and\r\nendangered the ships in the harbour. Howe was forced to abandon the\r\ntown, and on the 17th the British troops, about 7,600 in number,\r\ntogether with nearly 1,000 loyalists, embarked for Halifax, where Howe\r\nwaited for reinforcements which would enable him to strike at New York.\r\n\r\nIf the English had abandoned Boston after the battle of Bunker hill, the\r\nevacuation would have merely been a military movement, adopted for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a more convenient base for future operations. The\r\ngovernment decided that the place should be held, and its enforced\r\nevacuation was a moral defeat and a legitimate cause of triumph to the\r\nAmericans. Their exultation was dashed by the failure of their attempt\r\non Canada. Fresh troops were sent to support the invasion, but the\r\nfeelings of the people, English as well as French, were turning strongly\r\nagainst the Americans. After the evacuation of Boston, congress ordered\r\nWashington to send nearly half his effective force into Canada, and\r\ndespatched Franklin and other commissioners thither to allure the people\r\nwith promises. The Canadians turned a deaf ear to their offers. The\r\nmoment for which Carleton waited so patiently came at last. On May 6,\r\nbefore the river was fully cleared of ice, three British ships made\r\ntheir way to Quebec with reinforcements. He at once sallied out, and the\r\nAmericans fled in confusion, leaving their cannon and baggage behind,\r\nand even their pots boiling, so that the king's troops sat down and ate\r\ntheir dinners from them. Further reinforcements arrived from Halifax and\r\nfrom Ireland, and in June Burgoyne, who had spent the winter at home,\r\nbrought over the Hessian and Brunswick troops, raising Carleton's army\r\nto about 12,000 men. The Americans, under Sullivan, retreated from the\r\nneighbourhood of Quebec to Sorel. A large detachment was routed at\r\nThree Rivers, and Sullivan retreated to St. John's, leisurely pursued by\r\nBurgoyne. There he was joined by Arnold, and the remnants of the army of\r\nCanada, some 5,000 men, suffering severely from sickness and privation,\r\nescaped to Isle-aux-Noix, and thence to Crown Point. Canada was\r\nevacuated in June. Left almost defenceless by England, it was preserved\r\nto her by Carleton's firmness and intrepidity.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1776 the idea of separation from Great Britain was\r\ndaily gaining ground in the revolted colonies. It was strengthened by\r\nthe publication of a pamphlet entitled _Common Sense_ by Thomas Paine.\r\nThis Paine, a staymaker by trade, after he had failed in business in\r\nEngland, and had been dismissed from employment as an exciseman for\r\nneglect of duty, emigrated to America in 1774, and came into notice\r\nthrough introductions given him by Franklin. He was bitterly hostile to\r\nhis own country, a violent advocate of revolutionary ideas, ignorant and\r\nconceited; yet he had much shrewdness, and expressed his rude opinions\r\nwith a force and vivacity which appealed strongly to readers prepared to\r\nassent to them. _Common Sense_ taught thousands of Americans to\r\nrecognise for the first time their own thoughts and wishes, and\r\nencouraged others, who already knew what they wanted, to cease from\r\ndisguising their hopes by empty professions. Separation would, it was\r\nexpected in England, be opposed most vigorously in the southern\r\ncolonies. In them its cause was forwarded by violence. Lord Dunmore, the\r\ngovernor of Virginia, took refuge on board a man-of-war in June, 1775,\r\nmanned a small flotilla, and attempted to reduce his province by making\r\ndescents upon the coast. He enraged the people by offering freedom to\r\nslaves who would enlist under him, and by destroying the town of Norfolk\r\nthrough setting fire to some wharfs from which his men had been shot at\r\nwhile landing for water. He further engaged in a scheme for invading the\r\nsouthern colonies from inland with the help of the Indians. It failed,\r\nand the result of his proceedings was that Virginia was foremost in\r\nurging congress to a declaration of independence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ATTEMPT ON CHARLESTON._]\r\n\r\nThe governors of the two Carolinas assured the king that if a force were\r\nsent to their provinces the loyalists would rise; the Carolinas might be\r\nsecured, Virginia coerced, and all the south recovered for the crown.\r\nBoth George and Dartmouth believed them, and, against the advice of\r\nmilitary men, an expedition was prepared to sail to Cape Fear. The\r\ntroops were conveyed in a squadron under Sir Peter Parker and were under\r\nthe command of Lord Cornwallis. Clinton left Boston in December to take\r\nthe command, but the expedition was long a-preparing: it did not leave\r\nCork until February 12, 1776; the ships met with storms; none arrived at\r\nCape Fear before May 3, some were even later. Meanwhile Martin, the\r\ngovernor of North Carolina, stirred up the loyalist Scots settled in the\r\nprovince to take arms; they marched towards the coast, expecting to meet\r\nthe royal troops, were intercepted, and utterly routed. When at last\r\nClinton's force was gathered together, his time for action was short,\r\nfor he was under orders to meet Howe at New York at an early date. He\r\nand Parker decided to make an attempt on the harbour of Charleston, the\r\nchief town of South Carolina, for the trade carried on there was an\r\nimportant source of the insurgents' funds. It was not until June 4 that\r\nthe British force, about 2,000 troops, with Parker's squadron arrived at\r\nCharleston harbour.\r\n\r\nThe entrance was commanded by Sullivan's island and there the insurgents\r\nunder Moultrie had erected a fort and mounted guns. Clinton landed his\r\ntroops on Long island, intending that at low tide they should wade\r\nacross to Sullivan's island and attack the garrison on their rear, while\r\nthe ships bombarded them in front. The attempt was made on the 28th. The\r\ntide did not run out sufficiently to allow the troops to ford the shoals\r\nand the engagement was simply an artillery duel. The British ships\r\nsuffered severely; one frigate which went aground was set on fire to\r\nprevent the enemy from taking it, Parker's flagship the _Bristol_ and\r\nthe _Experiment_, both of fifty guns, were much knocked about, and some\r\n200 men were killed or wounded. The attack failed, and on July 21\r\nClinton's force sailed for New York under convoy of a single frigate,\r\nthe rest of Parker's ships being forced to refit. The expedition\r\nstrengthened the party of separation and bound the south closely\r\ntogether. Its failure depressed the loyalists, and for three years freed\r\nthe southern colonies from invasion, and enabled them to send help to\r\nother quarters. Less than a week after the unsuccessful attempt on\r\nCharleston, on July 4, the congress at Philadelphia, in which all the\r\nthirteen colonies were represented, put forth a declaration of\r\nindependence; the colonies renounced their allegiance, and declared\r\nthemselves free and independent states, the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the revolt during the summer of 1775 strengthened the\r\nking's determination to subdue it by force. A proclamation was issued in\r\nAugust against traitorous correspondence with the Americans, and in\r\nSeptember Penn, who brought over the petition of congress to the king,\r\nwas informed that no answer would be made to it. George could not have\r\nreceived it without recognising congress, an unauthorised assemblage of\r\nhis subjects engaged in levying war against him. The government was\r\npowerful in parliament, and the great majority of the nation warmly\r\napproved the royal policy, of which the ministers were scarcely more\r\nthan the agents. Little doubt was felt as to the successful issue of the\r\nwar; public spirit was aroused, and the cause of England was generally\r\nheld to be just. The landed gentry and the professions of the Church,\r\nthe army, and the law were strongly on the king's side. Self-interest\r\nlargely decided the attitude of the mercantile class: some of its\r\nmembers were opposed to the war because it injured their trade; others\r\nwere in favour of it; for trade generally was brisk and was increased by\r\nthe demands brought by war. In London and Bristol the opposition had\r\nmany supporters, but in both cities there was a strong party in favour\r\nof the government. Among the labouring classes the war was not popular\r\nand recruiting was difficult, for service in America entailed a long\r\nvoyage full of discomfort, and the prospect of fighting with men of the\r\nsame race and language was repellent. The evangelicals and methodists\r\nsided with the government; the dissenters generally were against the war\r\nand their preachers were active in encouraging their dislike to it.\r\nAddresses approving of the king's policy were numerous and unsolicited;\r\nthey poured in from all quarters, from tory Oxford and whiggish\r\nCambridge, from country towns and great commercial centres like\r\nLiverpool and Manchester. Rockingham observed that violent measures were\r\ncountenanced by a majority of persons \"of all ranks, professions, or\r\noccupations in this country\". Scotland almost to a man was of the same\r\npersuasion. In Ireland the nobles and the gentry generally upheld the\r\ncourt, but with the majority of protestants, and specially with the\r\npresbyterians of the north, the war was highly unpopular.[108]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHANGES IN THE MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the government were not less resolute than the king.\r\nLord Effingham resigned his commission in the army lest he should be\r\ncalled upon to serve against the Americans, and Chatham's eldest son\r\ntook the same course in obedience to the wishes of his parents. Grafton\r\nwrote to North in August, 1775, expressing his desire for conciliation.\r\nOn October 20 North sent him a draft of the king's speech which showed\r\nhim that the government was determined to reduce the rebellion by force\r\nof arms. He resigned the privy seal and went into opposition. The\r\nchanges which followed proved that a vigorous policy would be carried\r\nout. Dartmouth took Grafton's place and was succeeded as secretary of\r\nstate for the colonies by Lord George Germain, previously known as Lord\r\nGeorge Sackville. Germain was at this time one of North's followers, and\r\nwas appointed in order that he might help him in the commons. Violent in\r\nhis feelings against the Americans, he was acceptable to the king and\r\nacquired influence over him. His appointment was unpopular. He had fair\r\nability, but as minister allowed himself to be swayed by personal\r\nmotives, and he pursued a system already adopted by the king of\r\ndirecting military operations in America from London which had\r\ndisastrous consequences. Rochford retired with a pension of L2,500 and\r\nwas succeeded by Weymouth as secretary of the southern department.\r\n\r\nThe king's speech at the opening of parliament on October 26, 1775,\r\nstated that the Americans were in rebellion and were seeking to\r\n\"establish an independent empire\". Eight months had yet to pass before\r\nthe colonies declared their independence, and the effect of events which\r\nhastened their decision, such as the employment of German troops and the\r\nrefusal to answer the petition of congress, was not yet known in\r\nEngland. It will, however, scarcely be denied that between the\r\nproceedings of congress and a formal declaration of independence the\r\ndistance was not great. The strength of the king's position lay in his\r\nrecognition of this fact and of the course which alone might have\r\nquelled the growing spirit of rebellion without humiliation to Great\r\nBritain. The opposition did not see facts as they really were, and\r\ncalled for remedies which were either vague, of various import,\r\ninsufficient, or such as would have placed the crown in a humiliating\r\nposition. In the lords' debate on the address, Rockingham urged a vague\r\nundertaking to adopt measures of conciliation, Grafton the repeal of the\r\nacts relating to America since 1763, and Shelburne that the petition of\r\ncongress proved that the colonies were not \"planning independence\". In\r\nthe commons Burke taunted the ministers with failure; and Fox, who was\r\ncoming to the front, praised the spirit of the Americans, denied that\r\nthey were aiming at independence, and bitterly attacked North, who, said\r\nhe, had lost more in one campaign than Chatham, Frederick of Prussia, or\r\nAlexander the Great had ever gained--he had lost a whole continent. The\r\naddress was carried in the lords by 76 to 33, and in the commons by 176\r\nto 72.\r\n\r\nMotions were made in both houses declaring that the employment of\r\nHanoverian troops within the king's dominions, at Gibraltar and Minorca,\r\nwithout previous consent of parliament was unconstitutional. It was, the\r\nopposition maintained, a violation of the bill of rights, which declared\r\nthat \"the keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace,\r\nunless it be with consent of parliament, is against law\". On the\r\ngovernment side it was pointed out that it was not a time of peace and\r\nthat the clause did not apply to the dependencies of the kingdom. North,\r\nhowever, consented to a bill of indemnity which was thrown out by the\r\nlords, the opposition objecting to it on the ground that it asserted the\r\nlegality of the measure, the government that it was totally unnecessary.\r\nNumerically weak as the opposition was, it maintained the fight with\r\nspirit. Motions more or less directly aimed at the war policy of the\r\ngovernment were made in the lords by Grafton and Richmond, and in the\r\ncommons by Luttrell, Fox, Burke, Oliver, Hartley, Lowther, and\r\nSawbridge. On none of these did the minority vote stronger than 33 in\r\nthe lords and 105 in the commons. Burke, in bringing in a bill on\r\nNovember 16 for composing the troubles in America, urged that the right\r\nway was by concessions to be followed by treaty. He would maintain the\r\ndeclaratory act of 1766 as necessary to the authority of parliament, and\r\ncertain acts passed since 1763 as necessary to British trade; and he\r\ndesired that parliament should enact that no tax should be levied on\r\nthe colonies other than by their voluntary grant, and should repeal\r\ncoercive acts such as that closing Boston harbour. These concessions,\r\nwhile greater than the government would make, would not, it was pointed\r\nout, have satisfied the Americans; they did not go to the root of\r\nAmerican discontent, which lay in the revenue laws, and dated not from\r\nthe year 1766, but reached back to 1672. After a long debate, of which\r\nwe have virtually no record, for strangers were excluded from the house,\r\nthe bill was lost by 210 votes to 105.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE STATE OF THE NAVY._]\r\n\r\nThe government was successful in its proposals for the maintenance of\r\nthe war. Only 15,230 seamen were in pay in 1775; for 1776 the number\r\nvoted was 28,000. In the debate serious charges were brought against the\r\nadministration of the navy. Sandwich was diligent; he constantly\r\ninspected the dockyards, an excellent custom which he instituted when\r\nfirst lord in 1749, and he kept the navy board to its duties.[109] At\r\nhis office early in the morning he got through an amount of work\r\nsurprising in the case of a man who habitually spent the later part of\r\nhis day and his nights in drinking, gambling, and debauchery. The effect\r\nof his diligence was spoilt by corrupt practices. Many abuses prevailed\r\nin the administration of the navy before his time; money voted for\r\nrepairs was applied to other purposes, stores were paid for which were\r\nused for private gain, sea-pay was drawn for men who existed only on\r\npaper. Under Sandwich abuses of all kinds seem to have been carried\r\nfurther than before. The navy in 1776 consisted of 317 ships of various\r\nsizes and 49 sloops.[110] Of these 123 ships were \"of the line of\r\nbattle,\" a term then generally restricted to the first three rates,\r\nships of sixty-four guns and upwards. In spite of the large sums voted\r\nfor repairs, many of the king's ships were utterly unseaworthy, and it\r\nwas alleged with truth that ships, perfectly capable of repair, were\r\nsold as useless, while others, for which much money had been voted, had\r\nnot had a penny spent upon them. On this matter more must be said later.\r\n\r\nA bill enabling the king to embody the militia in times of rebellion met\r\nwith strong opposition on the ground that it would place a dangerous\r\npower in the hands of the crown, and was subversive of the\r\nconstitutional idea of the militia as a purely local force to be used\r\nonly for domestic defence; it was, however, finally carried by large\r\nmajorities. On the other hand, North's proposal to extend the militia to\r\nScotland was defeated by 112 to 95, for the country gentlemen, who\r\nregarded the militia system with extreme jealousy, voted against it. For\r\nthe army a vote was obtained for 55,000 men, of which 25,000 were to be\r\nemployed in America. It was easier to vote the money than to find the\r\nmen. The difficulty of recruiting was alleged by government to be a\r\nresult of the briskness of trade and such like causes. Already the Irish\r\narmy was reduced by drafts to less than the 12,000 men that by statute\r\nwere to be kept in that kingdom, and the government excited the\r\nindignation of an independent section in the Irish parliament and of the\r\nprotestants of Ulster by obtaining leave to withdraw 4,000 men more. The\r\nconduct of the government in this matter and in that of the hiring of\r\nGerman troops was strenuously though ineffectually attacked in the\r\nBritish parliament. The supplies voted for the year 1776 amounted to\r\nL9,097,000. The land tax was raised to four shillings in the pound, and\r\nthat with other ordinary ways and means would, North calculated, bring\r\nin L7,143,000. He proposed to make up the deficiency by borrowing\r\nL2,000,000; the loan was to be funded, and the interest of the new stock\r\nwas provided for by new taxes on carriages and stage coaches, dice and\r\ncards, by an additional stamp duty, and by raising the penny stamp on\r\nnewspapers to three-halfpence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMMISSIONERS FOR PACIFICATION._]\r\n\r\nActing on the ground taken up by the king's speech that the colonies\r\nwere waging a rebellious war, North, on November 20, 1775, brought in a\r\n\"prohibitory\" bill, which forbade all trade and intercourse with the\r\nAmericans, provided that American ships and goods taken at sea should be\r\nforfeited to the captors, being officers and crews of the king's ships,\r\nand repealed certain acts as no longer appropriate in the present state\r\nof war. It also empowered the crown to appoint commissioners to inquire\r\ninto grievances, to grant pardons to individuals, and to receive into\r\nthe king's peace any districts or colonies which would return to\r\nobedience. North declared himself ready to repeal the tea duty and to\r\nsuspend all exercise of the right of taxation if the Americans would\r\nbear their share of the burden of national defence. The bill was carried\r\nafter violent opposition in both houses. Fox described the war as unjust\r\nand impracticable, and said that the bill exhibited the folly of the\r\nministers. It was, the opposition urged, cruel and indiscriminate in its\r\nscope; it excited our seamen to \"promiscuous rapine,\" and provided that\r\nAmerican sailors who were taken prisoners might be compelled to serve in\r\nthe British navy against their own people. Such severity, they said,\r\nwould drive the Americans to a permanent separation and would eventually\r\nland us in a war with European powers. On the other hand it was\r\nreasonably maintained that, as the Americans were already at war with\r\nus, the war must be carried on as if against alien enemies. In April,\r\n1776, the king appointed Admiral Richard Lord Howe, then about to take\r\nthe command in American waters, and his brother, General Howe, as\r\ncommissioners in pursuance of the act. Their appointment testifies to\r\nthe sincerity of the king's desire for peace, for the Howes were\r\nfriendly to the Americans and had already made efforts to bring the\r\nquarrel to a peaceful ending; the admiral, indeed, declared in the lords\r\nthat if he were ordered to take part in the war, it would be painful to\r\nhim as a man, though he should obey as an officer. George, however, was\r\ndetermined not to sacrifice any of the rights of his crown. Submission\r\nwould be rewarded with pardon, obstinacy in rebellion met by war. He\r\nfeared lest Lord Howe should concede too much, and wished that he would\r\ndecline the commission.[111] He did not decline, and sailed for America\r\nwith offers of pardon. The king's speech at the close of the session on\r\nMay 23 expressed the earnest hope that his rebellious subjects would\r\n\"voluntarily return to their duty\". Peace was only to be obtained by\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99] P. O.

There he was\r\njoined by the reinforcements from England, conveyed by Lord Howe, and by\r\nClinton and his troops, so that in August he had with him some 25,000\r\nmen, English and German. Washington's army at New York numbered about\r\n19,000 effectives.[112] Mindful of his commission to restore\r\ntranquillity, Lord Howe wrote to him enclosing a copy of the king's\r\noffers. Washington would not receive the letter because the address did\r\nnot acknowledge his military rank, and observed that the powers of the\r\ncommissioners extended only to granting pardons, and that his people had\r\ndone nothing for which they needed pardon. The pacific mission of the\r\nHowes having so far failed, the general on August 22-25 landed an army\r\non Long Island, which is separated from New York by the East river.\r\nBrooklyn heights on Long Island, opposite New York, were strongly\r\nfortified and held by the Americans. Washington, believing that a larger\r\nBritish force was left in Staten Island than was really the case,\r\nthought it necessary to keep a numerous garrison in New York to meet a\r\ndirect attack on the place, and detached only some 9,000 men under\r\nPutnam to Long Island. They were for the most part posted so as to hold\r\na belt of wooded hills lying between their lines and the royal army.\r\nDuring the night of the 26th Howe outflanked them and brought his main\r\nbody to a position on their rear. The next day an attack was made on\r\ntheir front; they were caught between two divisions of the king's troops\r\nand were defeated. Howe put their loss at 3,300, which is certainly an\r\noverestimate, though he made nearly 1,100 prisoners, among them the\r\ngenerals Sullivan and Lord Stirling, as the Americans called him, an\r\nunsuccessful claimant of that earldom.[113] The British casualties were\r\n377. The Americans retreated within their inner lines. If Howe had\r\nallowed his troops to storm their entrenchments he would probably have\r\ndestroyed or taken the whole force on the island. He considered,\r\nhowever, that the lines could in a few days be taken \"at a very cheap\r\nrate\" by regular approaches, and decided not to risk the loss of any\r\nmore men.[114] He let his opportunity slip, and on the night of the 29th\r\nWashington, helped by a fog, cleverly withdrew his troops across the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NEW YORK TAKEN._]\r\n\r\nLord Howe took advantage of the American defeat to invite congress to\r\nsend some of its members to confer with him unofficially as to possible\r\nterms of peace. Congress, though it refused to sanction any unofficial\r\nnegotiations, sent commissioners from its own body to confer with him.\r\nNothing came of the conference, for the American commissioners would not\r\ntreat except on the basis of independence. On September 15 the British\r\narmy descended on Manhattan Island, on which New York stands, and the\r\nAmerican militia fled in disorder. The British took possession of New\r\nYork and of sixty-six of the enemy's guns. If Howe's movements had been\r\nmore prompt he might have cut off a large number of the enemy; he is\r\nsaid to have wasted time by lingering over luncheon at the house of the\r\nmother of Lindley Murray, the grammar-writer, who detained him by her\r\ncrafty hospitality. Washington drew off his troops to Haarlem heights,\r\nin the northern part of the island. The next day there was some\r\nskirmishing in which the Americans held their ground. The loyalists of\r\nNew York had been shamefully treated by the dominant faction, and the\r\nBritish were received with joy.[115] A few days later a large part of\r\nthe city was destroyed by fires evidently kindled by incendiaries.\r\nWashington and other generals had wished for military reasons to burn\r\nthe place. They were prevented by congress, but the idea was taken up\r\nby some violent revolutionists. The Americans were disheartened by their\r\nill-success; Washington's troops deserted in large numbers, and the\r\ngreatest disorder prevailed in his army. In England the news of Howe's\r\nvictory and his occupation of New York was received with delight, and\r\nthe king rewarded him with the Order of the Bath.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of New York gave the army an excellent base for\r\noperations either in the northern or southern provinces; it was easily\r\naccessible by sea, and lay in the midst of a district where loyalism was\r\nstrong. According to the ministerial plan, Howe should have been joined\r\nby Carleton's army, which was to have taken Crown Point and Ticonderoga,\r\ngained possession of the upper Hudson, and invaded the province of New\r\nYork from the north. After the Americans were chased out of Canada,\r\nCarleton's operations were stopped by the lack of a fleet to wrest the\r\ncommand of Lake Champlain from the rebels. During the summer he devoted\r\nhimself with extraordinary energy to collecting and building vessels.\r\nShips sent out from England were taken to pieces, carried overland to\r\nSt. John's and put together again, little gunboats and transports were\r\nbuilt, and by the beginning of October a larger and better fleet than\r\nthat of the Americans was afloat on the lake. It engaged the enemy's\r\nfleet, under Arnold, off Valcour island, on the 11th and again on the\r\n13th, and utterly destroyed it; only three of their vessels\r\nescaped.[116] Carleton occupied Crown Point, but as the season was so\r\nfar advanced did not attack Ticonderoga, or stay long enough to put\r\nCrown Point in a defensible condition; he placed his army in winter\r\nquarters and returned to Quebec. He might have done more. His decision\r\ndisappointed the king, and was represented to him in an unfavourable\r\nlight, for Germain had a personal grudge against Carleton, and had\r\nalready, in August, sent an order, which failed to reach him, that\r\nbeyond his province the command was to be taken by Burgoyne. George,\r\nconscious of Carleton's signal services, at first declared himself\r\nsatisfied that he had good reason for his decision; but Germain had the\r\nroyal ear, and when the news came that Carleton had actually closed the\r\ncampaign, the king accused him of slackness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WASHINGTON'S RETREAT._]\r\n\r\nAn example of real slackness was being given by Howe at New York. He\r\nshould with the aid of the fleet have made a prompt effort to prevent\r\nWashington from retreating from Manhattan island, and to cut off his\r\ncommunications with Connecticut whence he was drawing supplies. Even\r\nbefore occupying New York he might have conveyed his army by water to a\r\npoint from which White Plains, where the land begins to broaden out\r\nrapidly, might have been reached with ease. He wasted four weeks of\r\nprecious time at New York, and did not embark his troops till October\r\n12. Washington left his narrow position on Haarlem heights, gained White\r\nPlains before him, and fortified his camp. Howe attacked him on the 28th\r\nwith the object of outflanking him. Although part of his army by a\r\nfrontal attack drove the American right from a strong position, this\r\nsuccess was fruitless as well as costly. The insurgents' centre was\r\nweak, and if he had attacked it in force he might have crushed them\r\ncompletely. He made no further attempt in that direction, and Washington\r\nretreated to a good position behind Croton river. Howe returned to New\r\nYork. There, however, he dealt the Americans a serious blow. Fort\r\nWashington, on Manhattan island, and Fort Lee, opposite to it on the\r\nJersey shore, were intended to bar the Hudson and so secure\r\ncommunications with the country to the west of it. Congress, which often\r\ninterfered in military matters, ordered that Fort Washington should be\r\nheld, though in fact the forts did not prevent our ships from passing up\r\nthe river. On November 16 a well-planned attack was made upon the fort;\r\nit was forced to surrender, and 2,858 prisoners, forty-three cannon, and\r\na large quantity of small arms were taken by the British.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Cornwallis took possession of Fort Lee, together with 140\r\ncannon and stores of various kinds. He rapidly overran New Jersey.\r\nWashington had been drawn down thither, and Lee, whom he left at the\r\nCroton, failed to support him. He retreated hastily through New Jersey\r\nwith a force daily diminished by desertion. Cornwallis pressed upon him,\r\nbut was detained by Howe's orders for a week at Brunswick; and\r\nWashington, who left Princeton only an hour before Cornwallis entered\r\nit, had just time to convey his army, then reduced to some 3,300\r\nmen,[117] across the Delaware on December 8 before the British came up.\r\nThey were unable to follow him at once for no boats were left on the\r\neastern bank. Howe, who had joined Cornwallis, decided that no more\r\ncould be done and placed the army in winter quarters. He divided it into\r\nsmall detachments, and for the sake of protecting and encouraging the\r\nloyalists, extended his line of communication for eighty miles. The\r\nfortunes of the insurgents were at low ebb. Not only were the loyalists\r\nstrong in New Jersey, but crowds of the rebel party, many of them men of\r\nhigh standing, took advantage of the amnesty which Howe was empowered to\r\noffer. The Delaware would soon be frozen over, and, if the British\r\ncrossed it, Washington had not a sufficient force to hinder them from\r\nmarching on Philadelphia. The town was panic-stricken, and congress\r\nremoved to Baltimore. Washington's army dwindled. The period for which\r\nhis regular troops were enlisted would end on January 1, and as for the\r\nmilitia, that \"destructive, expensive, and disorderly mob\" as he called\r\nthem, they came and went as they pleased. \"The game,\" he thought, \"was\r\npretty well played out.\"[118] The Americans' distress was heightened by\r\nthe capture of Lee, who was on his way to join Washington. They reckoned\r\nhim their ablest general, though his insubordination and self-seeking\r\nrendered the loss of him an actual gain. About the same time Clinton\r\nsailed to Rhode Island with Sir Peter Parker, and occupied Newport\r\nwithout opposition.\r\n\r\nWashington's only chance lay in immediate action. The foolish\r\ndisposition of the British army gave him an opportunity. Their central\r\ncantonments, nearest to the enemy, were weak. Trenton was held by only\r\n1,200 Hessians; their discipline was relaxed, they were hindered by\r\ndifference of language from gaining intelligence, and they lived in\r\ncareless security. Washington was reinforced by Lee's troops and by\r\nthree regiments from Ticonderoga, which Carleton's inaction had rendered\r\navailable for service in the south. On the night of December 25 he\r\ncrossed the Delaware, and before daybreak took Trenton by surprise. The\r\nstartled garrison could make no resistance; about 200 escaped and 918\r\nwere taken prisoners. Of the Americans only two were killed and six\r\nwounded. Cornwallis, who was on the point of embarking for England,\r\nhastened back to the Jersey army. Washington avoided a general\r\nengagement, defeated two regiments employed in an operation for the\r\ndefence of Princeton, and before the middle of January, 1777, compelled\r\nthe British by a series of well-conducted movements to evacuate West\r\nJersey and withdraw to Brunswick and Amboy, where they went into\r\nquarters. The king's troops, British and German, committed many\r\nexcesses, plundering friends and foes alike; and the inhabitants,\r\nindignant at their conduct, took advantage of Washington's success and\r\nturned against them. Many joined Washington's army. The British were in\r\nthe midst of a hostile population, and though they had communication\r\nwith New York by water, were almost besieged by land, for their supplies\r\nwere constantly intercepted. The Jersey loyalists were left to the\r\nvengeance of their neighbours and were mercilessly plundered. Many of\r\nthem fled to New York where several thousand provincial troops were\r\nembodied. Howe remained inactive at New York until the spring, and\r\nWashington also stayed quietly at his headquarters at Morristown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A PARTIAL SECESSION FROM PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nParliament was opened on October 31, 1776. An amendment to the address\r\nreferring to American affairs was defeated in the lords by 91 to 26 and\r\nin the commons by 242 to 87. The news of the victory at Brooklyn--\"the\r\nterrible news,\" as Fox indecently called it--and of the occupation of\r\nNew York strengthened the ministers; and on a motion to revise the acts\r\nby which the Americans considered themselves aggrieved, the minority in\r\nthe commons sank to 47. Depressed by the exhibition of their weakness,\r\nthe Rockingham section ceased to attend parliament except on the\r\noccasion of private bills in which they were interested. Petulance and a\r\nfalse notion of dignity led them to neglect their duty to their country\r\nand their party. Their conduct was blamed by other whigs, and their\r\nsecession, though it occasioned discord in the opposition, did not\r\nparalyse its efforts. Fox, by that time its most effective orator, went\r\noff to Paris, and the king advised North to proceed with as much\r\nbusiness as possible in his absence.\r\n\r\nThe split in the opposition was specially manifested on the introduction\r\nof a government bill in February, 1777, for a partial suspension of the\r\n_habeas corpus_ act, in order to secure the detention of persons charged\r\nwith high treason in America or on the high seas; Rockingham, Burke, and\r\nothers adhered to their secession, while Dunning and Fox headed the\r\nminority in the commons. Fox warned the house not to be deceived by the\r\namicable professions of the French ministers, who, he said, were holding\r\nconferences with delegates from congress while he was in Paris, and were\r\nonly delaying to take part against England until the French navy was in\r\ngood order. He declared that our losses were far greater and our\r\nsuccesses far smaller than they were represented by government, and\r\ninveighed against the inhumanity with which he asserted the war was\r\nconducted on our side. He attacked the solicitor-general, who in\r\nanswering him pointed out that if, as he asserted, France was secretly\r\nintriguing against us the bill was specially necessary. In a personal\r\nencounter Wedderburn was a dangerous antagonist, and Fox met more than\r\nhis match. Dunning urged an amendment to prevent any abuse of the act;\r\nand North, always averse from violent measures, accepted his proposal.\r\nThe bill was carried by 112 to 33. Public feeling had lately been\r\nexcited on the subject of treason by incendiary fires which did much\r\ndamage in the Portsmouth dockyard and destroyed some buildings on\r\nBristol quay. They were found to have been the work of one James Aitken,\r\ncommonly called John the painter, who had lately returned from America,\r\nand who stated in his confession that he had acted at the instigation of\r\nSilas Deane, one of the emissaries of congress in Paris.[119] He was\r\nhanged at Portsmouth on March 10.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the war were growing. For 1777 parliament voted 45,000\r\nseamen, including 1,000 marines. The difficulty was to get them. A\r\nseaman's service was not continuous; when his ship was paid off he could\r\ngo whither he would. The peace establishment of the navy was\r\nridiculously small, and when a war broke out it was always difficult to\r\nget men in a hurry. Many of the best seamen would have taken service on\r\nboard merchant ships and would, perhaps, be at sea; and life on the\r\nking's ships in time of war was often so rough that it is not surprising\r\nthat men should have avoided it. The usual difficulty of manning the\r\nfleet at the beginning of a war was increased at the present time, for\r\nit was calculated that the revolt of the colonies deprived England of\r\n1,800 seamen. The navy in time of war was recruited by impressment, a\r\nsystem which, though recognised by common law, entailed much hardship.\r\nSeamen were kidnapped, often after a bloody struggle, and if caught\r\ninland were sent to the ports ironed like criminals. Men who had been at\r\nsea for years were liable, as soon as their ships neared home, to be\r\ntaken out of them, put into a press tender and sent to sea again.\r\nMerchant ships were stripped of their best men, and were left to be\r\nbrought into port by the master and a few lads. The press gangs looked\r\nfor trained seamen, though when a war lasted for some years they took\r\nwhat they could get; landsmen were impressed, and the press was\r\nsometimes abused as a means of getting rid of a personal enemy, a rival\r\nin love, or an inconvenient claimant. The system was expensive; it was\r\nstated that from 4,000 to 5,000 seamen were employed on the business,\r\nand that every pressed man who was found to be fit for sea cost the\r\nnation L30. High bounties were offered, but they failed to entice men to\r\nenter a service which the press might make practically continuous, and a\r\nproposal for a limited term of service was rejected by the commons. The\r\nsupplies for the year amounted to L12,592,534. New taxes calculated to\r\nyield L237,000 were laid on male servants, a guinea on each, stamps,\r\nimported glass, auctioneers, and sales by auction; and the deficiency of\r\nL5,500,000 was met by a loan, raised at 4 per cent., with a premium of\r\n1/2 per cent. to meet the state of the stocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARREARS OF THE CIVIL LIST._]\r\n\r\nWhile war was thus increasing the burden of the nation, the king again\r\napplied to parliament for payment of the arrears of the civil list,\r\namounting to L618,000. The ministers exhibited accounts which failed to\r\nsatisfy the opposition. Wilkes pointed out that payments since 1769 of\r\nL171,000 and L114,000 for secret service were each noted in a single\r\nline, and that there was a general charge of L438,000 for pensions. As\r\nin 1769, the arrears must be traced to an expenditure which increased\r\nthe king's influence. Wilkes said this plainly, Burke in less broad\r\nterms, and Fox taunted North with the pledge given when he was in office\r\nin 1769 that no such demand should be made again. Besides money\r\ndeliberately spent in corruption, vast sums were wasted on abuses in the\r\nroyal household, on sinecures, and on other useless places of profit.\r\nOne of the king's turnspits was a member of the house of commons, and\r\npaid L5 a year to a humble deputy, and no fewer than twenty-three\r\nseparate tables were kept up, eleven for the nurses. For such abuses\r\nGeorge was only partially responsible. Though he lived with a frugality\r\nwhich was almost meanness, he was in dire distress for money; the wages\r\nof his menial servants were six quarters in arrear, and he owed his\r\ncoal-merchant L6,000.[120] After much discussion the money was voted,\r\nand the civil list was increased to L900,000 a year. In presenting the\r\nbill to the king the speaker, Sir Fletcher Norton, dwelt on the\r\nmagnificence of the gift, and added that the commons were confident that\r\nhe would apply wisely what they had granted liberally. Though the court\r\nparty in the commons declared that he had not expressed the feeling of\r\nthe house, he received a vote of thanks for his speech. Towards the\r\nclose of the session Chatham was sufficiently recovered from his long\r\nillness again to attend parliament, and moved an address to the crown to\r\nput an end to the war. He pointed out the danger of foreign\r\nintervention, and declared that France was already destroying our\r\ncommerce. The idea of conquering America was absurd; America would not\r\nbe conquered by the loss of ten pitched battles. He was against American\r\nindependence, but this country, he said, was the aggressor, and \"instead\r\nof exacting unconditional submission from the colonies, we should grant\r\nthem unconditional redress\". His motion was negatived by 99 votes to 28.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN._]\r\n\r\nA fresh plan for obtaining the mastery of the line of the Hudson was\r\nalready in course of preparation. Burgoyne, who returned home in\r\nDecember, obtained the command of the northern army, and, on February\r\n28, laid a project of campaign before the government. He proposed to\r\nsecure Ticonderoga and the lakes, and march down the Hudson to Albany,\r\nwhere he was to effect a junction with Howe, previously detaching a\r\nsmall force to create a diversion by advancing from Oswego and down the\r\nMohawk river to Albany. The object of this plan was to open\r\ncommunication between New York and Canada, cut off New England from the\r\nsouthern provinces, and enable Howe to operate in the south with an\r\noverwhelming force. He pointed out the difficulties of the proposed\r\nmarch and suggested alternative schemes; but his first project was\r\nchosen by the king, and he was ordered to carry it out. The projected\r\ncampaign, if successful, would have been disastrous to the Americans.\r\nIts success depended on Howe's co-operation. An invasion by distinct\r\narmies, such as Burgoyne proposed, with bases far apart and acting on\r\nconverging lines, can only be undertaken with safety when\r\nintercommunication is secure and co-operation assured. Otherwise one of\r\nthe invading armies is liable to be crushed before it can receive help\r\nfrom another, specially when, as was the case here, the enemy can act on\r\nlines interior to those on which the invaders move. Burgoyne fell into\r\nthe error, common throughout the war, of trusting too much to loyalist\r\nhelp. Apart from that, however, his project assumed that Howe would be\r\nadvancing up the Hudson in time to get between him and any large force\r\nwhich might advance against him, and it failed miserably, because Howe\r\ndid not co-operate with him. Germain informed Carleton of the plan and\r\nordered him to resign the command of the northern army to Burgoyne; he\r\nwas to command only within his own province, keeping 3,700 men with him,\r\nand was to forward Burgoyne's expedition. Germain reproached him for his\r\nretirement from Ticonderoga, which, he said, gave Washington the means\r\nof breaking the British line at Trenton. Carleton was indignant at this\r\nunworthy treatment, and though he did what he could to help Burgoyne, he\r\nresigned the governor-generalship.[121]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter Howe formed a plan for taking Philadelphia, and on\r\nDecember 20, 1776, expounded it by letter to Germain, observing that the\r\nnorthern army would not reach Albany before September. Germain wrote on\r\nMarch 8 approving of his plan,[122] which might have been executed\r\nwithout preventing the junction contemplated by the minister. After some\r\nunimportant operations Howe took the field in June, and on the 5th\r\nreceived a copy of Carleton's instructions relating to Burgoyne's\r\ncampaign. Washington's difficulties were then somewhat relieved; he\r\nencamped at Middlebrook in a position too strong to be forced; he would\r\nnot be enticed to a general engagement, and Howe could not leave him in\r\nhis rear and push on to Philadelphia. Time was passing, yet Howe was\r\nstill set on prosecuting his design on Philadelphia. Finally he\r\nembarked an army of 14,000 men at Sandy Hook, and instead of remaining\r\nto be in readiness to co-operate with Burgoyne, left Clinton with 8,500\r\nmen to garrison New York and \"act as circumstances may direct,\" and on\r\nJuly 23 sailed for the Delaware, where he considered he would be\r\nsufficiently near to New York to act with Burgoyne, if necessary, and\r\nyet could carry out his own main design. The naval officers were\r\nunwilling to risk disembarkation in the Delaware, and Howe, determined\r\nnot to give up his design, sailed for Chesapeake bay. The fleet met with\r\ncontrary winds, and it was not until August 25 that his army landed at\r\nthe head of Elk river. Washington with about an equal force marched to\r\nthe north of the Brandywine to defend Philadelphia. The two armies met\r\non September 11. Howe, who well knew how to handle an army in the field,\r\nout-manoeuvred him, and after some sharp fighting the American army\r\nwas defeated with a loss of over 1,400 men, killed, wounded, and taken,\r\nand eleven guns. Congress again decamped, and on the 27th Cornwallis\r\ntook possession of Philadelphia amid the acclamations of a large part of\r\nthe inhabitants, while Howe and the main army encamped at Germantown,\r\nfive miles to the north.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HOWE'S OBJECT ATTAINED._]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure communication with New York and to supply the army,\r\nit was all-important that the fleet should be able to pass up the\r\nDelaware, which was strongly defended by forts, a bar, and a fleet of\r\nlittle vessels; and Howe detached troops to act against the forts.\r\nWashington lay a few miles to the north; he was joined by strong\r\nreinforcements, and determined to take advantage of the division of the\r\nBritish troops. He formed a plan for surprising and driving in their\r\nadvanced posts, cutting their force in two, crushing their right wing,\r\nand then doubling the whole army back on the Schuylkill river where it\r\nwould be at his mercy. He attacked at daybreak on October 4 under cover\r\nof a fog. The head of the British position was insufficiently guarded\r\nand the 40th regiment was driven back. At this critical moment its\r\ncommander, Musgrave, and a party of his men stopped the enemy's advance\r\nby seizing a house which stood in their way and holding it against them\r\nuntil the army had time to form. His gallant conduct saved the army. The\r\nAmericans fought well until, misled by the fog, one of their brigades\r\nfired on another. This threw them into disorder, which was increased by\r\nthe drunkenness of some of their officers and men. Cornwallis came up\r\nfrom Philadelphia in hot haste and pressed upon them. They retreated\r\nwith a loss of 673 killed and wounded, and 400 taken; on the British\r\nside the casualties were 551. Both in this action and in the battle on\r\nthe Brandywine the Americans showed that they had learned to fight with\r\nresolution and to retreat in good order. The two engagements proved that\r\nthough they might be defeated in the field, the war would not come to a\r\nspeedy end, and this enlisted foreign sympathy and encouraged France to\r\nintervene on their side.\r\n\r\nFor a month Howe was engaged in opening the passage of the Delaware. He\r\nsent for 4,000 men from New York. This reduction of the garrison was\r\nmost unfortunate, for, as we shall see, it put an end to Clinton's\r\nattempt to co-operate with Burgoyne.[123] At last the defences of the\r\nriver were destroyed, and communication was established between the army\r\nand the fleet. Washington retreated to Valley Forge, about twenty-five\r\nmiles from Philadelphia, and there put his army into quarters. During\r\nthe winter his troops suffered terribly from lack of clothing and\r\nprovisions. By Christmas nearly 3,000 were unfit for duty because they\r\nwere \"barefoot or otherwise naked\". They deserted in parties, a large\r\nnumber came to the British quarters, and scarcely a day passed without\r\nthe resignation of an officer. In February, 1778, there was almost a\r\nfamine in the camp, and Washington feared a general mutiny and\r\ndispersion.[124]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the British were in comfortable quarters in Philadelphia.\r\nHowe's object was attained; but though the capture of their capital\r\ndiscouraged the Americans, the loss of Philadelphia is not to be\r\ncompared with the loss of a capital of an organised state; it did not\r\nparalyse an administrative machinery or lessen the means of resistance.\r\nHowe's anxiety for its capture largely proceeded from his expectation\r\nthat it would be followed by a rising of the loyalists; he placed too\r\nhigh a value on professions of loyalty and on loyalist support. In\r\nitself the place was important; it was the largest of the American\r\ntowns, and it opened communication between the northern and southern\r\nprovinces, though so long as an insurgent army existed in Pennsylvania,\r\nan invader could not safely take advantage of its position. British\r\nofficers marvelled that Howe did not attack Washington while his army\r\nwas in so miserable a state. His inactivity cannot be defended\r\nsatisfactorily. He was looking forward to be relieved of his command; he\r\nwas disgusted by the inadequate response made by the government to his\r\nrepeated demands for large reinforcements; he informed Germain that\r\nwithout 10,000 more troops the war would not be ended in the next\r\ncampaign, and on October 22 wrote resigning his command. He allowed the\r\ndiscipline of his army to become lax. The winter was spent in idleness\r\nand dissipation. A bank at faro was opened, and many officers were\r\nruined by gambling. All ranks were demoralised, and sober townspeople\r\nwho had welcomed the arrival of the troops were disgusted by their\r\ndisorderly behaviour. The only fruit of Howe's victories during the\r\ncampaign of 1777 was the acquisition of good winter quarters at\r\nPhiladelphia, and that he purchased at the price of an appalling\r\ndisaster to a British army.[125]\r\n\r\nBurgoyne took the field in June with 7,251 rank and file of regular\r\ntroops, of which 3,116 were Germans, 148 militia, and 503 Indians, in\r\nall 7,902. Shortly before he left Canada a small force set out under\r\nColonel St. Leger to march from Lake Ontario, take Fort Stanwix, and\r\nform a junction with him by an advance through the Mohawk valley.\r\nBurgoyne's army was in fine order, but the arrangements for the carriage\r\nof supplies and the making of roads were insufficient. His troops were\r\ncarried up Lake Champlain and landed at Crown Point, where he made a\r\nspeech to his Indian allies, commanding them to observe the customs of\r\ncivilised warfare and to behave with humanity. He was to find that such\r\norders could not be enforced. On July 6, almost as soon as he arrived at\r\nTiconderoga, the Americans hastily abandoned it, leaving their guns\r\nbehind them. They were promptly pursued and suffered heavy losses. The\r\nfugitives joined Schuyler, the commander of the army in the north, at\r\nFort Edward; he evacuated the place and retreated southwards in the\r\ndirection of Albany. The news of Burgoyne's success caused much\r\nrejoicing in England. George is said to have rushed into the queen's\r\nroom as soon as he heard of it crying, \"I have beat them! beat all the\r\nAmericans!\" For the moment the Americans were panic-struck. Men said\r\nangrily that their troops would never hold a place until a general had\r\nbeen shot, and Schuyler was superseded by Gates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BURGOYNE IN DIFFICULTIES._]\r\n\r\nOn July 10 Burgoyne set out to march from Skenesborough to Fort Edward,\r\nsending his artillery and stores by water to Fort George. His route,\r\nthough not more than twenty miles, was extremely difficult; it was\r\nobstructed by trees felled by the enemy and lay through swamps and\r\nforests, and at least forty bridges had to be constructed in its course.\r\nHe might have avoided these difficulties by returning to Ticonderoga and\r\nconveying his army by water up Lake George; but he rejected that route\r\nbecause he thought that a retrograde movement would discourage his\r\ntroops and abate the panic of the enemy. His army did not reach the\r\nHudson until the 30th. At Fort Edward his supplies ran short and he had\r\nto wait there, for his means of transport were not sufficient to bring\r\nhis stores from Fort George. Garrisons had to be found for Ticonderoga\r\nand for posts of communication, and this diminished his army. Meanwhile\r\nthe enemy was increasing in force. While at Ticonderoga he published a\r\nfoolish proclamation reminding those who persisted in rebellion that he\r\nhad it in his power to let loose the Indians upon them. Nothing would\r\nhave induced him to commit so hideous a crime, and his proclamation only\r\nserved to enrage the Americans and swell the number of their troops. The\r\nIndians were offended by his efforts to restrain them, and deserted him;\r\nthey were no loss, for they caused more trouble than they were worth,\r\nand some excesses which they committed, and specially the murder of a\r\nMiss McCrae by an Indian who, it is said, was sent by her betrothed to\r\nbring her into the British lines, excited widespread indignation.\r\nBurgoyne was in sore need of supplies and made an attempt to seize the\r\ninsurgents' stores and horses collected at Bennington. He sent only some\r\n500 men on this service, for he was assured that the district was\r\nfriendly. It was far otherwise. The party was surrounded on August 16,\r\nand another detachment formed of German troops which was despatched to\r\nhelp them marched so slowly that it did not come up in time. Both bodies\r\nwere defeated with a loss, perhaps, of about 500 men.\r\n\r\nNews came of the failure of St. Leger's expedition. On his arrival at\r\nOswego he was joined by Sir John Johnson and Butler with their loyalist\r\nregiments, and by a force of Indians whom Johnson, one of their\r\nsuperintendents, and the Mohawk leader, Brant, persuaded to march with\r\nthem. He besieged Fort Stanwix, and, on August 6, defeated a force sent\r\nto relieve it. But his guns were too light for siege operations; the\r\ngarrison held out, and his Indians forced him to raise the siege. During\r\nhis retreat they mutinied; he was barely able to bring off his regular\r\ntroops, and lost his guns and stores. Burgoyne was in a dangerous\r\nposition; the country swarmed with enemies; \"wherever the king's troops\r\npoint,\" he wrote, \"militia to the number of three or four thousand\r\nassemble in a few hours\". He might have retreated to Fort Edward, where\r\nhe would have had communication with Lake George; but he held that he\r\nwas bound by his orders to advance, and on September 15, after\r\ncollecting provisions for about a month, he conveyed his force to the\r\nwestern bank of the Hudson and cut himself off from communication with\r\nthe lakes. Besides artillery, he had then with him only 5,000 men under\r\narms.[126] On the 19th his force was partially engaged by Arnold at\r\nFreeman's Farm. The British held their ground but lost over 500 men, and\r\nGates, the American commander, with 11,000 men, who did not take part in\r\nthe fight, occupied a strong position in front of them. A message came\r\nfrom Clinton that he was about to attack the forts on the Hudson below\r\nAlbany, and Burgoyne sent answer that he hoped to be able to hold his\r\nground until October 20. He fortified his position and waited for\r\nfurther news. None came to him. The insurgent forces grew to at least\r\n16,000 men; Burgoyne's provisions were becoming exhausted and on October\r\n3 he put his little army on half rations. Despite the overwhelming\r\nnumber of the enemy, he moved forward on the 7th to ascertain whether he\r\ncould force a passage through their lines. He was defeated with heavy\r\nloss and fell back on Saratoga.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SURRENDER OF BURGOYNE'S ARMY._]\r\n\r\nA council of war held on the 12th decided on a retreat to Fort Edward.\r\nIt was too late; the Americans held the fords and had a strong force\r\nencamped between Fort George and Fort Edward. Only 3,500 fighting men\r\nwere left with Burgoyne; he was completely surrounded, and on the 14th\r\nhe opened negotiations with Gates. Even then he refused to surrender\r\nunconditionally, and the convention of Saratoga was concluded on the\r\n17th. His troops marched out with the honours of war, and were to be\r\nallowed to return to England on condition of not serving again in the\r\nwar. The whole number which surrendered, including camp-followers,\r\nlabourers, and detachments, was 5,762. Gates's behaviour at the\r\nsurrender was such as became an officer and a gentleman. Congress\r\nshamefully broke the engagement. The captive troops were marched to\r\nBoston, but when the transports called for them, they were not allowed\r\nto embark. The paltry subterfuges by which congress defended its conduct\r\nonly throw a specially odious light on its sacrifice of honour to\r\npolicy. From the beginning of the war both sides made frequent\r\ncomplaints as to the treatment of prisoners, and both apparently with\r\njustice. Burgoyne's men were shamefully treated. He and his staff were\r\nallowed to return home in the spring of 1778; others were exchanged from\r\ntime to time, but the mass of the army never came back. Clinton, who was\r\nthen unaware of Burgoyne's distress, did what he could to render his\r\nposition secure in case he arrived at Albany. As soon as he received\r\nreinforcements from England, he pushed up the Hudson and on October 6\r\ndestroyed the forts which barred the passage of our ships. He could do\r\nno more, for he was forced to send 4,000 men to Howe and could not leave\r\nNew York without a sufficient garrison. A messenger from Burgoyne at\r\nlast reached him. The way being cleared, the ships ascended the river\r\nand burnt the batteries and town at Esopus creek. The news of Clinton's\r\nactivity doubtless secured Burgoyne more favourable terms than Gates was\r\nat first inclined to grant.\r\n\r\nThe chief blame for this disaster must rest on Howe. His assertion that\r\nPhiladelphia was the prime object of his campaign made Germain uneasy,\r\nand he wrote to him on May 18 that whatever he might meditate, he was\r\nnot to neglect to co-operate with the northern army.[127] This despatch\r\ndid not reach Howe until August 16, when he had made co-operation with\r\nBurgoyne impossible. A few days later Germain wrote again; the despatch\r\nwas not ready for his signature at the time at which he wished to go\r\ninto the country, and when he came back it was forgotten. It was a piece\r\nof gross carelessness, but an undue importance has been attached to\r\nit.[128] Howe was well aware of Burgoyne's expedition. On June 5 he had\r\nreceived a copy of a despatch from Germain which told him that Burgoyne\r\nwas ordered to \"force his way to Albany\" and join him with the utmost\r\nspeed.[129] Nevertheless, he persisted in pursuing his own plan. He must\r\nhave hesitated whether to reach Philadelphia by land or water. When in\r\nJune he at last made up his mind to move, he evidently tried to reach\r\nPhiladelphia by land. If he had succeeded and had swept Washington\r\nbefore him, he might have kept in communication with Burgoyne and have\r\nco-operated with him. Failing in this, he decided to go by sea, and when\r\nhe was told that he could not safely land in the Delaware, went on to\r\nChesapeake bay. When he gained his object by taking Philadelphia he did\r\nso by a course which made it impossible for him to co-operate with\r\nBurgoyne, and put Washington's army between them.\r\n\r\nAccording to the government plan the chief object of his campaign should\r\nhave been his junction with Burgoyne. The government, that is Germain,\r\ncertainly erred in not giving him precise orders, while Burgoyne had\r\nvirtually no discretionary power. Yet it was for Howe, as\r\ncommander-in-chief on the spot, to judge of the situation without\r\nexplicit instructions. According to his own statements, his view of the\r\nsituation was that Burgoyne would march through a friendly country and\r\nencounter no enemy except the army of 4,000 men under Schuyler, that\r\nClinton would be able to give him any assistance which he might require,\r\nthat his own expedition to Philadelphia would divert the enemy from\r\nBurgoyne, that he would be able to \"account for\" Washington, and that if\r\nWashington gave him the slip, he would be able to follow him up and\r\nprevent him from annoying Burgoyne.[130] These considerations may be\r\nsupposed to have satisfied him that no direct co-operation with\r\nBurgoyne was required of him. Burgoyne had to encounter foes whom\r\nneither he nor Howe reckoned upon, and it was Howe's duty to be at hand\r\nto prevent their crushing him. Burgoyne made some mistakes in preparing\r\nfor and prosecuting his campaign, but he and his men exhibited splendid\r\ncourage, and he is not to be blamed for trying his fortune to the\r\nutmost. In view of his orders, and of the risk of leaving a co-operating\r\nforce unsupported, he was bound to ascertain whether he could force his\r\nway through the enemy. The irregular character of the American force\r\nrendered success possible, and justified his gallant attempt of October\r\n7. He was a fine soldier, and was regarded with confidence and affection\r\nby his subordinates. Clinton seems to have done all that was in his\r\npower considering the small force left with him in New York.[131]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFECT OF THE SURRENDER._]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Burgoyne's army could not in itself affect the issue of\r\nthe war. Its importance lies in its effect on the policy of foreign\r\nnations and specially of France. So far as the Americans alone were\r\nconcerned, England had good reason to expect ultimate success. They\r\nwould neither enlist in sufficient numbers to keep up a regular army nor\r\nprovide for such troops as they had. The meddlesomeness and incapacity\r\nof congress were destroying its army; generals were intriguing against\r\none another, soldiers were perishing for lack of necessaries, stores\r\nwere wasted. Money was scarce and public credit bad. Early in 1778\r\ncongress had 5,500,000 paper dollars in circulation, and the value of\r\nits paper dollar was from half to a quarter of the silver dollar. Above\r\nall, the Americans had no fleet, and were consequently unable to protect\r\ntheir sea-board. Their alliance with France and subsequently with Spain\r\nbrought them, along with other help, the sea-power without which the\r\nissue of the struggle might well have been adverse to them. France and\r\nSpain hoped to recoup themselves for former losses, France by conquests\r\nin the West Indies, Spain by regaining Gibraltar, Minorca, and Jamaica.\r\nIn 1775 an agent of the French court went over to America with offers of\r\nhelp, and early in 1776 the Count de Vergennes, foreign minister of\r\nLouis XVI., proposed as a system of policy that the Bourbon kings should\r\ngive secret aid to the Americans and strengthen their own forces,\r\ntaking care, however, to persuade England that their intentions were\r\npacific. About the same time congress sent Deane to France as a secret\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the proposal of Vergennes the French and Spanish\r\ncourts provided money for the Americans; and Beaumarchais, the\r\ndramatist, who masqueraded as a firm of merchants in order to conceal\r\nthe participation of his government, spent it in purchasing military\r\nstores for them. The young Marquis de Lafayette and other Frenchmen\r\nentered their army. So too did the Poles, Kosciusko and Pulaski, and the\r\nGermans, Kalb and Steuben. In December Franklin went over to Paris. The\r\nphilosophic movement was then at its height in France. The _philosophes_\r\ndesired freedom of thought in religion, constitutional liberty, and the\r\nabolition of privilege of all kinds. They speculated as to the origins\r\nof political and social institutions and the laws of human progress. The\r\nworks of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu were eagerly studied by the\r\nnobles and fine ladies of the court with whom _philosophisme_ was\r\nfashionable. America they regarded as a land of freedom and primitive\r\nsimplicity; and they hailed the crude assertions of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, issued by a body largely composed of slave-owners, that\r\nall men are created equal and with an inalienable right to liberty, as\r\nbringing their theories within the range of practical politics. Franklin\r\nwas received with ludicrous adulation as an embodiment of republican\r\nvirtue and philosophic thought. He busied himself in stirring up\r\nhostility to England. Another American envoy sought help from Prussia.\r\nFrederick showed his hatred of England by forbidding some German troops\r\nwhich George had hired to pass through his dominions; but his quarrel\r\nwith Austria with reference to the Bavarian succession rendered him\r\nunwilling to provoke Great Britain: he had no sympathy with the\r\nAmericans and would not receive their envoy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INTERVENTION OF FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nBesides the stores sent by Beaumarchais and 1,000 livres in cash, France\r\nhelped the Americans by neglecting to prevent the violation of her\r\nneutrality by their ships. Although the Americans could not dispute with\r\nGreat Britain on the sea, they had a few ships built by congress, more\r\nbelonging to the maritime provinces, and a vast number of privateers.\r\nThese ships did much damage to British trade. Already they hovered\r\nabout the coasts of England and Ireland, and were so dangerous to our\r\nmerchant vessels that merchants embarked their goods on foreign ships to\r\navoid the risk of capture. By the end of 1778 nearly 1,000 merchant\r\nships were taken by American privateers. Some of these privateers were\r\nfitted out in French ports, brought their prizes into them, and sailed\r\nfrom them again on fresh expeditions. Our ambassador, Lord Stormont,\r\ncomplained vigorously of these open breaches of neutrality, and at last\r\nthe French government took some measures to stop them. The opposition in\r\nparliament constantly insisted that, if the war went on, France and\r\nSpain would certainly take part with the Americans. The government could\r\nno longer ignore, though it still strove to discredit, the danger of\r\nforeign intervention. The king's speech at the opening of parliament on\r\nOctober 20, 1777, took note of the naval preparations of the two powers\r\nand recommended an augmentation of the navy. Tidings of Burgoyne's\r\ndisaster reached Europe on December 2. Vergennes at once informed the\r\nAmerican agents that his master would make a treaty with them. The\r\nalliance was concluded on February 6, 1778; it was agreed that, in the\r\nevent of war between France and England, neither of the contracting\r\nparties should make peace without the consent of the other or until the\r\nindependence of the United States should be assured by treaty. France\r\nrenounced all claim to Canada. If taken from England, it was to belong\r\nto the United States, while all conquests in the West Indies were to\r\nbelong to France. Spain at this time declined to join in the alliance.\r\nThat a treaty was signed was soon generally believed in England; it was\r\nofficially declared by France on March 13. War between Great Britain and\r\nFrance began in the summer.\r\n\r\nWith the intervention of France the war enters on a new phase.\r\nThenceforward England had to deal with more powerful enemies than the\r\nAmericans. The war had lasted for three years and the rebellion was not\r\ncrushed. Was it too much for England to expect that she would subdue a\r\npeople of her own stock, as the Americans were then, separated from her\r\nby 3,000 miles of sea, and spread over a vast and difficult country? Had\r\nshe trusted to her navy, as Barrington and others desired, shut the\r\nAmerican ports, and held the towns on the coast and the navigable\r\nrivers, the insurgents might possibly have been driven to submission\r\nwithout any severe struggle. Conquest by land was decided on. Was\r\nChatham right in declaring in May, 1777, that England could not conquer\r\nthe Americans? Six months later a capable French officer serving in\r\ntheir army wrote to the French minister of war that, unless his country\r\ndeclared war against England, the Americans would fail to obtain\r\nindependence; so little enthusiasm for the cause was there among them,\r\nso keenly did they feel the privations of the war.[132] In our war in\r\nSouth Africa of 1899-1902 the Boers showed themselves better soldiers\r\nthan the Americans, and were not less brave; they were akin to us in\r\nrace, and their country was at least as difficult as America. In both\r\nwars our well-drilled troops constantly found their previous training\r\nuseless or worse; in both we received loyal support from numerous\r\ncolonials on the spot. While improved means of transport brought South\r\nAfrica far nearer to us than America was in the eighteenth century, the\r\nBoers were better prepared for war than the Americans, and were a more\r\nmartial people. Yet England conquered them. So far, then, as the\r\nAmericans alone were concerned, Chatham's assertion must be denied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLAND'S CONDUCT OF THE WAR._]\r\n\r\nWhy then had England done so little in those three years? There was much\r\nactive loyalty on our side: thousands of colonials fought for the crown\r\nduring the course of the war; in the central provinces at least half the\r\npopulation was for us. Everything depended on the vigour and judgment\r\nwith which force was applied. In these respects there was failure both\r\nat home and on the spot. In the first place the effort required was\r\nunderestimated. In February, 1774, Gage thought four regiments would\r\nkeep things quiet; in 1775 it was believed that 10,000 men would be\r\nenough; in January, 1776, Howe asked for 20,000, in November his\r\nestimate for the next year was 35,000. Germain promised to raise his\r\narmy to that number, yet instead of 10,000 men he offered him only 7,800\r\nrank and file. On March 26 he confessed that he could only send 2,900,\r\nand on April 19 that he had to subtract 400 of these for Canada.[133]\r\nThe country was strong for coercion, but recruits were hard to raise; it\r\nwilled the end but not the means. The king and Germain interfered too\r\nmuch with the plans of operations. To direct a war from the other side\r\nof the Atlantic in days when letters between the secretary at war and\r\nthe commander-in-chief seem often to have been nearly two months on\r\ntheir way, was to court failure.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the war the enemy was unduly despised both by ministers\r\nat home and soldiers in the field. As the British general in command at\r\nBelmont is said to have rejected a proposal for turning the Boers'\r\nposition, declaring that he would \"put the fear of God into them,\" so\r\nHowe at Bunker hill delivered a frontal attack on the enemy's\r\nentrenchments which cost him over 1,000 men. Then he went to the\r\nopposite extreme of over-caution. It is needless to recapitulate the\r\noccasions on which either from over-caution or supineness he allowed\r\ngreat opportunities to slip, as notably on Long Island. He, indeed, in a\r\ngreater degree than any one else is responsible for the British failure\r\nto bring the war to an end. Every month improved the fighting qualities\r\nof the Americans, under the judicious handling of Washington, and at\r\nlast France and the other enemies of England saw that they might take\r\nthem seriously and might turn the war to their own profit.[134]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] Johnston, _Campaign of 1776_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[113] Mr. Johnston contends that the American casualties were about\r\n1,000 (_op. cit._, pp. 202-6); they were probably about double that\r\nnumber (Fortescue, _History of the British Army_, iii., 185).\r\n\r\n[114] Howe, _Narrative of Conduct_, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\n[115] Johnston, _Campaign of 1776_, Documents, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[116] Carleton to Douglas, Oct. 14, 1776, Add.

The nation at large showed\r\na worthier spirit by seeking to repair its loss. Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nEdinburgh, and Glasgow each raised a regiment; and other regiments and\r\ncompanies were raised in the Highlands and in Wales. In London and\r\nBristol the corporations refused to join the movement, but large sums\r\nwere subscribed by private persons for raising troops. The opposition\r\nabsurdly maintained that these levies were unconstitutional, and Fox\r\naccounted for the zeal displayed by Manchester and Scotland by observing\r\nthat they were \"accustomed to disgrace\". The ministers were bitterly\r\nreproached for employing Germans and Indians. \"If,\" said Chatham, \"I\r\nwere an American, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I\r\nwould never lay down my arms--never--never--never.\" He condemned the\r\nemployment of Indians in the war in words of fiery eloquence. It was\r\ncertainly deplorable that they should have been employed. In that\r\nmatter, however, England had no choice. They would have taken part in\r\nthe war on one side or the other. They had fought in every war between\r\nthe English and French in America, and while Pitt himself was conducting\r\nthe war in 1760 Amherst used them with the authority of government.[135]\r\nIn the present war the Americans were the first to employ them, and in\r\n1776 congress resolved that it was expedient to do so and authorised\r\nWashington to enlist 2,000 of them. They were more ready to fight for\r\nthe king than for the Americans, who had treated them badly; and as they\r\ncaused the insurgents trouble and committed many shocking acts of\r\nbarbarity, the Americans inveighed against us for employing them. If we\r\nhad not done so they would have fought for the Americans, as some of\r\nthem did. Otherwise we should have been better without them, for no\r\ndependence could be placed upon them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE OPPOSITION DISUNITED._]\r\n\r\nEnergetic as the opposition was in attack, it was not united in policy.\r\nChatham, zealous for England's imperial position, declared that he would\r\nnever consent to American independence. There was yet time to make peace\r\nwith the people of our own blood and so be ready to meet our foreign\r\nfoes. He proposed a cessation of hostilities and an immediate offer of\r\nterms. All that the Americans could demand as subjects should be\r\ngranted, and overtures made to them on the basis of political dependence\r\nand the navigation act; that is, their trade should still be regulated\r\nby duties. They would, he was sure, accept these terms. If not, they\r\nmust be compelled to obedience. The Americans would certainly not have\r\ntreated on his basis. Chatham had repeatedly declared that it was\r\nimpossible for us to conquer them; yet he proposed that if his basis\r\nwere rejected we should use coercion after putting ourselves at a\r\ndisadvantage by withdrawing our army. Still, as there were many\r\nAmericans besides the loyalists who would have welcomed conciliation,\r\nand as the proposed French alliance was unpopular, it is just possible\r\nthat had Chatham himself been prime minister some way might have been\r\nfound which, while securing to America virtual independence such as\r\nEngland's self-governing colonies now enjoy, might have prevented the\r\nseverance of the bond. On the other hand, the Rockingham party held that\r\nwe should prevent the alliance between France and America by\r\nacknowledging American independence. This division between the two\r\nsections of the opposition set them in hostile camps.\r\n\r\nWhen people were convinced that the alliance was certain the nation\r\nbecame uneasy, and a strong feeling prevailed, which was shared by some\r\nof Chatham's opponents, that at such a crisis England needed him at the\r\nhead of affairs. In February, 1778, it was believed that he and Bute\r\nwere engaged on some scheme of coalition which might again put him in\r\npower. The report was merely the outcome of the officious meddling of\r\nhis physician, Addington, and one of Bute's friends.[136] No one was\r\nmore anxious than North for a change of ministry. He begged the king in\r\nvain to accept his resignation. On the 17th he brought in two bills for\r\na scheme of conciliation to which George had at last given his sanction.\r\nHe proposed an express repeal of the tea duty, the surrender of all\r\ntaxation except for the regulation of trade, and the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to be sent to America with full powers to put an end to\r\nhostilities, grant pardons, and treat with congress on any terms short\r\nof independence. His proposals did not materially differ from those made\r\nby Burke three years before. He declared that he was not responsible for\r\nAmerican taxation, that it was the work of his predecessors, and that he\r\nhad always desired conciliation. He was heard with general\r\nconsternation: his own party felt that he was turning his back on the\r\npolicy which they had supported under his leadership; the opposition,\r\nthat he was, as it were, stealing their thunder. The bills were carried\r\nand the king appointed the commissioners. They arrived in America in\r\nJune. Congress refused to listen to any offers short of independence;\r\nthe commissioners appealed to the American people, and their manifesto\r\nwas treated with contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S CONDUCT EXAMINED._]\r\n\r\nWhen the Franco-American alliance was announced, North was urging the\r\nking to invite Chatham to take office and to allow him to retire, and\r\nShelburne was sounded as to the terms on which Chatham would come in. He\r\nreplied that he would insist on \"an entire new cabinet\". George, who had\r\nunwillingly agreed to this negotiation, was prepared to accept any men\r\nof talent with a view of strengthening the existing ministry, but not of\r\nforming another in its place, or of changing its measures. He would not\r\ncommission Chatham or any opposition leader to form a new ministry: \"no\r\nadvantage to this country nor personal danger to himself\" would, he\r\nwrote to North, induce him to do so; he would rather \"lose his crown\".\r\n\"No consideration in life,\" he wrote again, \"shall make me stoop to the\r\nopposition;\" he would not give himself up \"to bondage\". His\r\ndetermination has been pronounced equally criminal with the acts which\r\nbrought Charles I. to the scaffold.[137] According to our present ideas\r\nhe should certainly have been guided by the assurance of his first\r\nminister that the government was unequal to the situation, have\r\naccepted his resignation, and allowed his new ministers to act as they\r\nthought best. These duties, however, were not, as we have seen, so\r\nclearly settled in those days. The prime minister of our time was not\r\nthen fully invented, and George's plan of personal government through\r\nministers was not yet rejected by the country. He could still rely on\r\nthe support of parliament. A proposal to request the king to dismiss his\r\nministers was defeated at that very time by 263 to 113 in the commons\r\nand by 100 to 36 in the lords. Chatham's return to office would\r\ndoubtless have been hailed with satisfaction by the nation. Yet, though\r\na change in public sentiment with regard to the American war was\r\nbeginning, and was soon to spread rapidly, the king's policy was still\r\npopular with the larger part of his subjects.[138] When therefore his\r\nconduct in March, 1778, is compared with that of Charles I. it should be\r\nremembered that George had parliament and the mass of the nation at his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe personal light in which he regarded the question is inexcusable. He\r\nhad been disappointed and deeply offended by Chatham's political\r\nconduct, and he had cause to fear that a whig government would rob him\r\nof the power which he loved. As a king he had no right to allow his\r\nprivate feelings to affect his public action. That he did so was the\r\nresult partly of his system of personal rule, partly of serious defects\r\nin his character, his implacability of temper, and his habit of\r\nregarding all things as they affected himself. North struggled in vain\r\nagainst his determination, and gave way before it. It is a mistake,\r\nhowever, to regard the king as solely responsible for the continuance of\r\nthe war. If he is to be blamed because, rather than submit to the loss\r\nof the colonies, which nearly all men believed would be the end of\r\nEngland's greatness and prosperity, he determined to carry on the\r\nstruggle, the blame must be shared by others. Had North been true to his\r\nconvictions George could not have formed another administration willing\r\nto act on the same system. Had the majority of the commons refused to\r\nsupport the king, the constitution afforded the means of over-ruling his\r\nwill.[139]\r\n\r\nQuestions as to Chatham's return to power were soon to be brought to an\r\nend. On April 7 he appeared in the lords after a severe attack of\r\nillness, and, in faltering sentences, though with some remains of his\r\npeculiar fire, protested against the surrender of the sovereignty of\r\nAmerica, \"the dismemberment of this ancient and most glorious monarchy\".\r\nHe urged that England should refuse to bow before the house of Bourbon;\r\n\"if we fall let us fall like men\". Richmond answered him by dwelling on\r\nthe expediency of acknowledging American independence; otherwise, said\r\nhe, \"instead of Great Britain and America against France and Spain, as\r\nin the last war, it will now be France, Spain, and America against Great\r\nBritain\". Chatham rose to reply and fell back in a fit. He died on May\r\n11. Parliament voted him a public funeral, the stately statue which\r\nstands in Westminster Abbey, L20,000 for the payment of his debts, and a\r\nperpetual pension of L4,000 a year annexed to the earldom of Chatham.\r\nThroughout his long career he was invariably courageous and\r\nself-reliant; his genius was bold, his conceptions magnificent, his\r\npolitical purity unsullied. His rhetoric was sublime. He did not excel\r\nin debate or in prepared speeches. His spirit burned like fire, and his\r\nspeeches were the outpourings of his heart in words which, while they\r\nowed something to art, came spontaneously to his lips, and were not less\r\nlofty than his thoughts. As a statesman he had serious defects; he was\r\nhaughty, vain, and overbearing, his opinions were unsettled, his\r\nfar-reaching views often nebulous; his passion was stronger than his\r\njudgment, and he was immoderately given to bombast. In spite of his true\r\ngreatness he lacked simplicity, and he imported the arts of a charlatan\r\ninto political life. Yet Englishmen must ever reverence his memory, for\r\nhe loved England with all the ardour of his soul, and, as Richmond said\r\nas he praised him to his face on the day that he was stricken for death,\r\n\"he raised the glory of the nation to a higher pitch than had been known\r\nat any former period\".\r\n\r\nIn 1778 the losses and expenses of the war and disappointment at its\r\nresults began to work a change in the feeling of the country. In\r\nparliament tories sometimes voted with the opposition. North continued\r\nto strive in vain to be released from office. He made some overtures to\r\nthe opposition. Fox, in spite of the violence of his attacks, was\r\nanxious for a coalition, which would have given him office, though he\r\nheld first that Germain only, and in 1779 that North himself and\r\nSandwich, must be excluded.[140] He was restrained by Rockingham, and\r\nNorth's efforts failed. The death of Chatham, though it united the\r\nopposition, on the whole strengthened the ministry, and in June, 1778,\r\nit gained in ability by the appointment of Thurlow as chancellor and\r\nWedderburn as attorney-general. Burgoyne, who was unfairly treated by\r\nGermain, was defended by Fox, and on his return joined the opposition.\r\nThe struggle in parliament had a constitutional importance not\r\noverlooked by either party. On the issue of the American war, \"the\r\nking's war\" as it was called, depended the question whether George would\r\nbe able to establish his system of government by influence. The\r\nopposition reckoned on failure in America, and hoped that, by exposing\r\nthe errors and corrupt practices of the government, they would so rouse\r\npublic feeling that, when the war ended in national humiliation, the\r\nking would be forced to accept a minister imposed on him by his people.\r\nNo party can reckon on national humiliation as a means of attaining its\r\nends, however praiseworthy they may be, without serious consequences to\r\nits own character. When England was in extreme peril, the opposition,\r\nand Fox above all, magnified her losses, encouraged her enemies by\r\nexposing her weakness, and, not content with insisting on the\r\nmaladministration of the government, cavilled at every measure proposed\r\nfor the defence of her empire. Their conduct irritated their\r\nfellow-countrymen, for the spirit of the nation was roused by the\r\nintervention of France in the war with the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ADMIRALTY ABUSES._]\r\n\r\nAmple grounds existed for dissatisfaction with the government.\r\nUnfortunately, this was specially the case with respect to the navy. Its\r\nexpenses had greatly increased. During the eight years of the late war,\r\n1755 to 1762, the money spent upon it, exclusive of ordnance and votes\r\nfor men, amounted to no more than L3,390,000; during eight years of\r\nSandwich's administration, 1771 to 1778, it was stated in parliament to\r\nhave been L6,472,000.[141] During the latter period there had been voted\r\nfor repairing and building ships L2,900,000, and for extra stores for\r\nthem L600,000, in all L3,500,000, enough, it was said, to build 100\r\nmen-of-war and as many frigates. Nothing is so destructive to efficiency\r\nas corruption. Under Sandwich abuses of all kinds flourished. Many\r\nexisted before his time, and things grew worse under him. When in 1778\r\nthe naval estimates for the year were laid before the commons, it was\r\nstated that though L27,000 had been voted between 1771 and 1775 for the\r\nrepair of the _Dragon_ (74), and L10,273 for her stores, the ship was\r\nlying untouched and rotting at Portsmouth, and so in various degrees\r\nwith other ships. In reply, Welbore Ellis, the treasurer of the navy,\r\nsaid that though estimates were the usual way of raising money, the\r\nmoney once raised was spent at the discretion of the admiralty.\r\nIndignant at this amazing statement, Burke flung the smart book of\r\nestimates at the treasury bench. Ships were built of foreign oak of an\r\ninferior kind and needed constant repair; contracts were jobbed; stores\r\nwere wasted, stolen, and sold. The country paid for many more seamen\r\nthan it got; for example, in September, 1777, the number returned as\r\nvictualled was 51,715, though the seamen actually serving were only\r\n47,407. Greenwich hospital, with a revenue of L70,000, was a hot-bed of\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\nWhat was the result of this corrupt system? How did our navy stand in\r\n1778 in comparison with the navies of France, then at war with us, and\r\nSpain, which was on the eve of joining against us? Choiseul's policy of\r\nnaval reform was steadily pursued, and in 1778 France had eighty ships\r\nof the line in good order and 67,000 seamen. Spain followed the lead of\r\nFrance and, when she entered the war in 1779, had about sixty ships of\r\nthe line. In 1778 we had 119 first, second, and third rates; of this\r\nnumber there were, on Sandwich's showing, in November, 1777, excluding\r\nships on foreign service, only thirty-five manned and ready for sea, and\r\nseven which he said were nearly ready, but some of the thirty-five were\r\nshort of their full complement of men, and there was a great scarcity of\r\nfrigates. By July, 1778, the number ready was stated as forty-five. But\r\nwhen Keppel put to sea in June, it was with difficulty that twenty-one\r\ncould be got ready to sail with him.[142]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OFF USHANT._]\r\n\r\nKeppel, though an opponent of the government, was appointed to command\r\nthe \"grand,\" or, as it was called later, the channel fleet, apparently\r\nat the king's wish. On July 27 he engaged the French fleet from Brest\r\nunder Count d'Orvilliers, westward of Ushant, both having thirty ships\r\nof the line. An indecisive action took place, the two fleets passing\r\neach other on opposite tacks and exchanging broadsides. Sir Hugh\r\nPalliser, the third in command and one of the lords of the admiralty,\r\nwas blamed for the resultless issue of the engagement. A quarrel ensued\r\nbetween him and Keppel, which was made a matter of party politics; the\r\ngovernment upheld Palliser, the opposition Keppel, and violent speeches\r\nwere made in parliament. A court-martial in 1779 honourably acquitted\r\nKeppel of the charges which Palliser brought against him, and he\r\nreceived the thanks of parliament. London was on his side; the mob\r\ngutted Palliser's house and broke the windows of the admiralty and of\r\nsome official residences. Another court-martial acquitted Palliser\r\nthough with a slight censure. Keppel was annoyed by the position taken\r\nup by the admiralty, notified his wish not to serve again under the\r\npresent ministry, and struck his flag. The rot of faction, which was\r\ninfecting political life, laid some hold on the navy. Other naval\r\nofficers declared that they would not serve under Sandwich; the spirit\r\nof insubordination affected the seamen and symptoms of mutiny appeared\r\nin the channel fleet.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of France forced England to contract her operations in\r\nAmerica. The project of isolating the northern provinces was dropped,\r\nand thenceforward her efforts were mainly directed towards the recovery\r\nof the southern colonies, in order to secure their trade, and the\r\nsuppression of privateering expeditions from the New England coast. Howe\r\nwas recalled at his own request, and the chief command was given to\r\nClinton, who was ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and concentrate\r\nupon New York, where a French attack was expected. Philadelphia was\r\nevacuated on June 18, 1778. Of its loyalist citizens 3,000 embarked for\r\nNew York; those who remained behind were harshly treated and two quaker\r\ngentlemen were hanged for adhering to the enemy. As Clinton's army was\r\nmarching through New Jersey, the Americans tried to cut off his\r\nrear-guard near Monmouth, but after an indecisive engagement failed in\r\ntheir attempt. Clinton reached New York without further molestation,\r\nand soon afterwards Washington encamped at White Plains. The Toulon\r\nfleet under Count d'Estaing arrived off Sandy Hook on July 11, and Lord\r\nHowe with a far inferior force prepared to defend the entrance to the\r\nport. While D'Estaing lay outside, the wind rose; he was afraid to risk\r\nhis ships by an attempt to cross the bar, and sailed away southwards,\r\nfor Washington persuaded him to attack Newport in conjunction with an\r\narmy under Sullivan. Lord Howe followed him, and arrived at Point Judith\r\non August 9, the day after the French ships passed the batteries.\r\nD'Estaing stood out to sea to meet him. Howe's fleet, though reinforced,\r\nwas still much the weaker, but \"Black Dick,\" as the sailors called him,\r\nwas master of his profession and out-manoeuvred D'Estaing who was a\r\ncavalry officer turned admiral. A storm dispersed both fleets and\r\nD'Estaing, after collecting his ships, sailed off to Boston to refit.\r\nSullivan retreated and got away from Rhode Island a day before Clinton\r\narrived with 4,000 men. Lord Howe soon afterwards resigned his command,\r\ndeclaring that he would not serve again under the present ministers.\r\nD'Estaing sailed from Boston to the West Indies, leaving the American\r\npopulace furious at his departure from Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nClinton was called upon to send 5,000 men to the West Indies, Washington\r\nwas badly supported by congress, and neither was in a position to act\r\nagainst the other. Successful expeditions were made in the autumn\r\nagainst the privateering haunts of the insurgents, Buzzard's bay,\r\nMartha's Vineyard, and on the New Jersey coast; many ships were taken\r\nand much damage was done. The western frontiers were raided by the tory\r\ntroops of Johnson and Butler and by our Indian allies. Shocking\r\nbarbarities were committed, specially in the Wyoming valley, where the\r\nprisoners were massacred by the Indians, though there the women and\r\nchildren were spared, and at Cherry Valley, where there was a general\r\nmassacre during the attack. In 1779 the Americans retaliated on the\r\nIndians with fearful severity, and cruelly wasted the lands of the\r\nSenecas and Cayugas and the settlements in the Alleghany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MISTAKEN NAVAL POLICY._]\r\n\r\nNeither the operations on the coast nor the border fighting had any\r\nmaterial influence on the progress of the war. By the end of 1778,\r\nhowever, the war entered on a new and, as it proved, decisive phase; it\r\nbecame a struggle for the southern provinces. In November Clinton sent\r\na small force by sea under Colonel Campbell to invade Georgia. Campbell\r\nrouted the Americans and took Savannah; and General Prevost, who joined\r\nhim from Florida, easily obtained possession of the province. Lincoln's\r\nattempt to regain it was defeated at Briar creek on March 3, 1779, and\r\nPrevost penetrated into South Carolina. He finally retired to Georgia,\r\nleaving a garrison at Port Royal, which secured his access to the sea\r\nand gave him a footing in South Carolina, as well as a base for covering\r\nGeorgia. The campaign was a promising opening of operations in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the outbreak of the war reached the West Indies, the French\r\ngovernor of Martinique seized Dominica, while Admiral Barrington, in\r\ncommand of a small squadron at Barbadoes, was waiting for orders. As\r\nsoon as Barrington received the reinforcements sent by Clinton, he\r\nattacked St. Lucia. D'Estaing came over from America with a fleet of\r\ntwice the size, but failed to engage our ships closely, and, after some\r\nfighting on the island, in which the French lost heavily, sailed off to\r\nMartinique. St. Lucia was surrendered on December 29. Nothing further of\r\nimportance took place in those parts until the summer of 1779, when\r\nD'Estaing seized St. Vincent while Byron, who was then in command, was\r\nengaged in guarding a convoy. D'Estaing then sailed with all his fleet\r\nto Grenada and forced the garrison to surrender. Byron, though\r\nencumbered by a number of transports and with a smaller fleet, engaged\r\nhim in the hope of relieving the island. Some of Byron's ships suffered\r\nbadly, and when he found that the garrison had surrendered, he sailed\r\noff. D'Estaing did not press his advantage, for his sole object was to\r\nsecure his conquest, and only one transport ship was taken. England was\r\nno longer supreme by sea. The fault lay not with her admirals, who were\r\nstill skilful, nor with her seamen, who were as bold as ever. Her\r\nweakness was due to her government, which first allowed the navy to fall\r\ninto an inefficient condition and then adopted a wrong system of naval\r\nwarfare. She began the contest unprepared, and instead of preventing the\r\nfleets of the enemy from reaching the ocean, had to fight in distant\r\nparts with inferior forces. As the war went on strenuous efforts brought\r\nher navy to a higher pitch; yet she still neglected her first line of\r\ndefence, did not concentrate her forces off the ports of the enemy, and\r\nstrove to defend the distant parts of her empire with fleets of\r\ninadequate strength.[143]\r\n\r\nAfter much hesitation Spain made alliance with France against England on\r\nApril 12. The treaty, which did not include the Americans, provided that\r\nSpain should recognise their independence and that the two contracting\r\npowers should invade England; and the reconquest of Gibraltar and\r\nMinorca, the acquisition of the coast of Florida, and the expulsion of\r\nthe English from Honduras were mentioned among the objects which Spain\r\ndesired to effect. She did not declare war until June 16, in order that\r\nthe two fleets might have time to prepare for united action. England\r\nreceived the news of the combination with spirit; volunteers enlisted\r\nfor defence and large sums were subscribed for raising troops, equipping\r\nprivateers, and other patriotic purposes. The Spaniards at once\r\nblockaded Gibraltar, then under the command of General Eliott, and began\r\nthat three years' siege which is one of the most honourable incidents in\r\nour military history. Though the home fleet, under the command of Sir\r\nCharles Hardy, lay in the Bay of Biscay on the look out for the allied\r\nfleets, they effected a junction, got between him and Plymouth, and in\r\nAugust sixty French and Spanish ships of the line and a crowd of smaller\r\nvessels paraded before the town. English pride was deeply wounded, and\r\nthe landing of the enemy was daily expected. But the vast fleet\r\naccomplished nothing save the capture of one ship of the line. Its crews\r\nwere wasted by sickness, and when a change of wind enabled Hardy to\r\nenter the Channel, the enemy did not follow him into its narrower waters\r\nand early in September left our shores.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VARIOUS INCIDENTS OF NAVAL WARFARE._]\r\n\r\nThe war was carried on in many parts of the world, and was full of\r\nincidents which, as they had little or no effect on its issue, must only\r\nbe noticed briefly. In October, 1778, Pondicherry was taken by the East\r\nIndia Company's troops, and the French lost all their settlements in\r\nIndia. One of them, Mahe, was claimed by Haidar as tributary to him, and\r\nits capture afforded him a pretext for making war on us. He overran the\r\nKarnatic in 1780, defeated a British force, took Arcot, and reduced\r\nMadras to great straits. In the spring of 1779 the French made a feeble\r\nattack on Jersey, and were repulsed by the 78th regiment and the\r\nmilitia of the island. The British factories at Senegal were seized by\r\nthe French, and Goree by the English. The Spaniards expelled our logwood\r\ncutters from Honduras in August, and about the same time the Spanish\r\ngovernor of Louisiana reduced West Florida, which was thinly inhabited\r\nand almost undefended. The enemies of England hoped to break her power\r\nby destroying her commerce, but it was too large and various to be\r\nruined by casual losses, and too carefully protected to incur a series\r\nof them. While the trade of France with the West Indies was almost\r\nruined, the English Jamaica fleet reached home in safety a few days\r\nafter the enemy left the Channel. Privateers and king's ships did so\r\nmuch damage to the commerce of France and Spain in 1779 that it was held\r\nto counterbalance the loss of St. Vincent and Grenada. American cruisers\r\nwere still troublesome. Paul Jones, a Scottish sailor, who held a\r\ncommission from congress, infested the coasts of Scotland and Ireland,\r\nand in 1779 received a ship from the French government, which he called\r\nthe _Bonhomme Richard_. With her and four smaller vessels he sailed from\r\nBrest, and fell in with the homeward-bound Baltic fleet convoyed by the\r\n_Serapis_, Captain Pearson, and a sloop of war. Pearson engaged the\r\n_Bonhomme Richard_, and after a desperate fight the two English ships\r\nwere forced to strike. His gallant conduct saved the convoy, and the\r\n_Bonhomme Richard_ was so severely mauled that she sank the next day.\r\nThe Americans suffered at least as heavily as the English from this\r\ndesultory warfare, and their privateering ventures were checked by\r\noperations on their coast.\r\n\r\nWhile Washington was encamped in the high lands north of New York,\r\nguarding his position by forts on the Hudson, and specially by the\r\nfortification of West Point, Clinton took two posts which commanded the\r\npassage of the river, and, in conjunction with Admiral Sir George\r\nCollier, distressed the enemy by various expeditions. The New England\r\ncoast was thoroughly scoured by Collier's squadron, some towns on the\r\nChesapeake were invaded, a great quantity of stores seized, and about a\r\nhundred and twenty vessels taken or destroyed. Partly in the vain hope\r\nof drawing Washington down from his position, and partly in order to cut\r\noff one of the main sources of his supply, a force from New York was\r\nlanded in Connecticut, some towns on the coast were destroyed, and\r\nstores and shipping burnt or carried off. Further operations there were\r\nstopped by an expedition from Boston against a British post established\r\nin Penobscot bay, to check the incursions of the enemy into Nova Scotia.\r\nAs soon as Collier appeared in the Penobscot river the Americans burnt\r\nmost of their ships; he captured the rest, and the whole naval force of\r\nMassachusetts was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Lincoln persuaded D'Estaing to bring his fleet from the\r\nWest Indies and join him in driving the British out of Georgia. The\r\nFrench and Americans, about 10,000 strong, laid siege to Savannah, which\r\nwas defended by Prevost with a force of only 2,500 men. An assault was\r\nmade on the place on October 9, and was repulsed with heavy loss. The\r\nsiege was abandoned; D'Estaing with most of his ships sailed for France,\r\nand the American army retreated into South Carolina. D'Estaing's arrival\r\non the coast warned Clinton of the necessity for concentration, and he\r\nordered the evacuation of Rhode Island. When the French fleet had\r\ndeparted he prepared to attack Charleston, and on February 11, 1780,\r\nlanded his army on the coast of South Carolina. The town, which was\r\ndefended by Lincoln, was besieged on April 1, and surrendered on May 12.\r\nMore than 5,000 prisoners were taken, including seven general officers,\r\nbesides about 1,000 French and American seamen, 400 guns, and the whole\r\nnaval force in the harbour. Cornwallis obtained further successes in the\r\nprovince; South Carolina was cleared of the enemy, and the inhabitants\r\ngenerally professed submission. After striking this great blow Clinton\r\nwas forced to return to New York, for a French fleet was bringing over\r\ntroops to act with Washington, and Cornwallis was left with only 4,000\r\nregulars, besides provincials, to carry on the war in the south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FIGHTING IN LINE OF BATTLE._]\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1779 the garrison of Gibraltar was reduced to great\r\nstraits. The West India command had lately been given to Rodney, already\r\na distinguished officer and destined to take a high place among\r\nEngland's sea-captains. Before he proceeded to his station he sailed\r\nwith a large convoy for Gibraltar and Minorca. On his way he captured a\r\nSpanish convoy, sent the sixty-four-gun ship which protected it to\r\nEngland with the merchandise, and carried the provisions destined for\r\nthe besiegers off Gibraltar to the besieged garrison. Off Cape St.\r\nVincent he came on a Spanish squadron of inferior strength under the\r\ncommand of Don Juan de Langara, cut the Spaniards off from Cadiz, took\r\nsix of their ships, and destroyed another. He carried out the relief of\r\nGibraltar and on February 13 sailed for the West Indies, where Count de\r\nGuichen was commanding in place of D'Estaing. Down to this time the\r\nnaval battles of the century had generally been inconclusive, except\r\nwhen one fleet was much stronger than the other. Admirals kept strictly\r\nto the formation known as the line of battle in which one ship followed\r\nanother in regular order. If both the admirals of opposing fleets were\r\nwilling to bring matters to a decided issue, the fleet to windward would\r\nattack, and the ships go at one another at close quarters all along the\r\nline. English admirals, with sufficient force, always hoped to bring\r\nthis about. They were seldom successful, for the French admirals were\r\nunwilling to fight at close quarters, not because they were afraid to\r\nmeet the British, but partly because they generally had some other\r\nobject in view than the destruction of the enemy's fleet, some conquest\r\nto make or some place to protect, and partly because the French having\r\nfewer ships were indisposed to make free use of them in battle.\r\nAccordingly a French admiral preferred the leeward position. This\r\nenabled him to avoid a decisive action, for when a British fleet bore\r\ndown on him, he could cripple our leading ships in their rigging, and\r\nthen break off the action by running before the wind.\r\n\r\nRodney made the destruction of the enemy's fleet his first aim. There\r\nwas only one way of accomplishing it. That was by deserting the old\r\nsystem of fighting in line, van to van, centre to centre, rear to rear.\r\nHe sighted Guichen's fleet on April 16 as it was sailing northwards and\r\nwell to leeward of Dominica. Guichen was convoying merchantmen, and\r\nintended ultimately to attack Barbadoes. The two fleets were nearly of\r\nequal strength. Rodney gained the windward position, and engaged the\r\nnext morning. He planned to bring the whole of his force to bear on the\r\nFrench centre and rear. After much manoeuvring the opportunity came.\r\nUnfortunately his captains, accustomed to the old routine, did not\r\nunderstand his signal. His well-devised plan was defeated and the battle\r\nwas as inconclusive as its predecessors. Rodney was bitterly\r\ndisappointed, for a decisive victory seemed within his grasp.[144] He\r\nconsidered that some of his captains did not behave with sufficient\r\npromptitude and set himself to bring his fleet to a high pitch of\r\nefficiency. Guichen was joined by a Spanish fleet which gave him a great\r\nnumerical superiority. It was no profit to him; the Spanish ships were\r\nhot-beds of disease and he had to convoy them to San Domingo. Then he\r\nsailed off for France with the larger part of his force. By that time\r\nthe hurricane season was at hand and Rodney divided his fleet, leaving\r\nabout half in the West Indies, and sailing with the remainder to New\r\nYork, where he arrived on September 12. England had full command of the\r\nsea in the American waters, and Rodney did little there and,\r\nunfortunately, as we shall see in our next chapter, less than he might\r\nhave done. At New York his squadron escaped the hurricane which swept\r\nover the West Indies on October 10. As Rodney was a tory his\r\ndistinguished services were peculiarly gratifying to the king and the\r\ngovernment. He was created a Knight of the Bath and received a pension\r\nwith remainder to his children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESTRAINTS ON IRISH TRADE._]\r\n\r\nThe war brought Ireland an opportunity for insisting on a redress of\r\ngrievances. By 1773 the prodigality of government raised the national\r\nexpenditure far above the revenue. Lord Harcourt, the viceroy,\r\nrecommended a tax of 10 per cent. on the rents of absentees. The\r\nproposal was popular in Ireland, and North was willing to agree to it.\r\nThe great Irish landlords of the Rockingham party were strongly opposed\r\nto the tax, and Burke argued that it would hinder Irishmen from taking\r\npart in the political life of Great Britain and would imply that England\r\nwas a foreign land. A strong feeling against the tax was excited in\r\nEngland. North gave way and, in obedience to instructions, Harcourt\r\nprocured the rejection of the bill. The grievances of the country\r\nincreased. The American war was unpopular with the presbyterians, the\r\npeace and safety of the land were imperilled by the withdrawal of its\r\ntroops, its finances were burdened by pensions and by grants for the\r\nwar, and the public debt which in 1770 was L669,230, entailing a charge\r\nof L26,631, stood in 1778 at L939,323, with a charge of L82,711. The\r\nrestrictions on Irish trade were rendered specially grievous by the war.\r\nAn embargo laid on the export of provisions from Ireland ruined her\r\ntrade in cattle. Debarred from the woollen manufacture in the interest\r\nof English industry, she had been encouraged to manufacture linen, and\r\nher trade in linen prospered. The war with America deprived her of her\r\nprincipal market. The restraints placed upon her commerce with England\r\nbrought her into close commercial connexion with France, and that source\r\nof profit was also cut off in 1778. Many of her people were driven\r\nabroad by want; and the poor who remained were only kept alive by\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 proposals were made in the English parliament to relax the\r\nrestrictions on Irish trade. North approved of the proposals, and they\r\nwere powerfully supported by Burke. Liverpool, Bristol, and other\r\nEnglish manufacturing towns protested loudly against admitting Ireland\r\nto compete with them. North yielded to pressure, and the supporters of\r\nthe bills were forced to accept a measure which was wholly insufficient\r\nto satisfy the needs of the Irish. The disappointment in Ireland was\r\nbitter. Something, however, was gained; the system of restriction was no\r\nlonger intact. The same year saw the beginning of a relaxation of the\r\npenal code. Common wrongs and common aspirations helped to subdue\r\nreligious animosity. The cause of the catholics was urged in the Irish\r\nParliament by the splendid oratory of Henry Grattan. A bill was passed\r\nenabling them to take leases for 999 years and, except in the case of\r\nconverts, to inherit land as freely as protestants. The law was no\r\nlonger to offer an inducement to a man to abandon his father's faith for\r\nthe sake of gain; it was no longer to put the estate of a catholic\r\nfather under the power of a professedly protestant son.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the attempt to obtain relief from commercial restrictions\r\ntaught the Irish that England would not sacrifice her own interests to\r\nrelieve their distress, and that they must help themselves. Following\r\nthe example of the Americans, they formed associations for\r\nnon-importation. These associations showed the English manufacturers\r\nthat Ireland could retaliate upon them. England was, however, forced to\r\nconcession by another means. The assent of the Irish parliament to\r\nEngland's proposal that drafts should be sent to the war from the 12,000\r\nmen who should have been kept for the defence of the country, reduced\r\nthe number of troops in Ireland to less than 5,000. The coasts were\r\ninfested by privateers and a French invasion was expected. England had\r\nno troops to spare and her fleets were fully engaged. Abandoned by\r\ngovernment, the Irish protestants took up arms to defend their own\r\ncountry. The Duke of Leinster and Lord Charlemont threw themselves\r\neagerly into the movement, which was supported by the majority of the\r\nIrish gentry, catholics as well as protestants; though for some time the\r\ncatholics did not volunteer because they were disqualified from bearing\r\narms. Before long 42,000 volunteers were learning military discipline,\r\narms were purchased and officers chosen. The Irish government regarded\r\nthe movement with uneasiness, but took advantage of it as a protection\r\nagainst invasion, and distributed 16,000 stands of arms among the corps.\r\nThe volunteers, while thoroughly loyal, adopted a distinctly national\r\npolicy. England was in difficulties and could not withstand the demands\r\nof so powerful a body. In the session of 1779-80 parliament, at North's\r\ninstance, abandoned the system of restriction on Ireland's trade; threw\r\nopen to her trade with the colonies and repealed the acts restraining\r\nthe exportation of her woollens and glass. About the same time the\r\ninfluence of the volunteers procured the assent of government to a bill\r\nreleasing Irish dissenters from the sacramental test. Great as these\r\ngains were, Irish aspirations reached further. On April 19, 1780,\r\nGrattan proposed a declaration of legislative independence. For that the\r\nIrish parliament was not ready. Lord Buckinghamshire, the viceroy,\r\nsecured support by lavish promises of recommendations for peerages and\r\nother good things, and parliament deserted the popular cause. In\r\nDecember, Buckinghamshire was succeeded by Lord Carlisle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AGITATION FOR ECONOMICAL REFORM._]\r\n\r\nDuring 1779 North's government lost ground; the ministers were known to\r\nbe divided in opinion, and various parliamentary inquiries into the\r\nconduct of the war revealed much maladministration. Even the king said\r\nthat Germain was \"of no use in his department,\" and Fox's vote of\r\ncensure on the admiralty was supported by a minority of 170. Some\r\nchanges in the ministry failed to strengthen it. In 1778 Jenkinson\r\nsucceeded Barrington as secretary at war; he lived to prove himself a\r\nman of ability, but in his new office he, like his predecessor, had\r\nmerely to carry out the orders of others. Gower, a strong advocate of\r\nAmerican coercion in 1775, changed his opinions, resigned the\r\npresidentship of the council in November, 1779, and made a violent\r\nattack on the government. He was succeeded by Lord Bathurst the\r\nex-chancellor. Suffolk died and was succeeded as southern secretary by\r\nLord Stormont, and Weymouth, the northern secretary, by Hillsborough.\r\nNorth still urged the king to accept his resignation. George, conscious\r\nof the shortcomings of the ministry, gave Thurlow authority to treat\r\nwith Shelburne, as head of the Chatham party, with a view to the\r\nformation of a strong administration, composed of men of different\r\nparties, to be formed without North, and independently of the existing\r\nministry. Grafton persuaded Shelburne not to act apart from the\r\nRockingham whigs. The united opposition would have insisted on a\r\ncomplete change of measures as well as of men, which would have implied\r\nthe surrender of America. To this George would not consent, and North\r\nwas again persuaded to remain in office. On the meeting of parliament in\r\nNovember, 1779, the ministers carried the address by 233 to 134, a\r\nmajority which bore out the assertion of the king's speech that\r\nparliament was with him, and the speech added \"my people at large\".\r\n\r\nYet though the declaration of war by Spain called forth a loyal address,\r\nunanimously voted by the commons, assuring the king of their help\r\nagainst the Americans, many held that it would be well to withdraw the\r\ntroops from America and use the whole strength of the country against\r\nits foreign enemies. The expenses of the war were heavy; additions were\r\nmade to the public debt of L6,000,000 in 1778, of L7,000,000 in 1779,\r\nand of L12,000,000 in 1780, and many new taxes were imposed. At the same\r\ntime large sums were expended on maintaining useless offices, a crowd of\r\npensioners, and other abuses, the means by which the king kept his hold\r\non parliament. The whigs determined to take advantage of the demands\r\nmade on the nation to strike at the root of that corrupt influence by\r\ninsisting on public economy. The attack was begun unsuccessfully in the\r\nlords by Richmond and Shelburne, and in December Burke gave notice that\r\nhe would lay a plan of economical reform before the commons. The whigs\r\nsought to bring pressure to bear on parliament by an appeal to the\r\npeople and met with a ready response. A county meeting at York, presided\r\nover by Sir George Savile, sent a petition to the commons for public\r\neconomy, and formed an association to promote that object and the\r\nrestoration of the independence of parliament. Twenty-five other\r\ncounties and some cities and towns sent similar petitions and most of\r\nthem formed associations. On February 11, 1780, Burke introduced his\r\nplan in a speech of remarkable ability. He proposed a reform of the\r\nking's civil establishment, the abolition of a crowd of court offices, a\r\nreform of certain public departments, the limitation of pensions, the\r\nsale of the crown lands, and the abolition of the jurisdictions of\r\nWales, Cornwall, Chester, and Lancaster. His bills were destroyed\r\npiecemeal in committee, and the only result of his scheme which, if\r\nfully carried out, would, he calculated, have saved the nation over\r\nL1,000,000 a year, was the abolition of the board of trade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a sharp struggle went on in the commons. A proposal for an\r\naccount of patent places was agreed to, but another for submitting a\r\nlist of pensions was lost by two votes. A crowded meeting was held at\r\nWestminster on April 5 and was addressed by Fox who, with vehement\r\neloquence, recommended annual parliaments and an addition of 100 county\r\nmembers as a means of freeing parliament from the influence of the\r\ncrown. Government apprehended an attempt to overawe parliament and\r\nstationed soldiers in the neighbourhood of Westminster Hall. This step\r\nenraged the opposition, and on the 6th Dunning proposed a resolution in\r\nthe commons that \"the influence of the crown has increased, is\r\nincreasing, and ought to be diminished\". This resolution was carried,\r\nwith a trifling addition, by 233 to 215, and another that the house was\r\ncompetent to correct abuses in the civil list was adopted without a\r\ndivision. On the 10th, however, a resolution that certain officers of\r\nthe household should be disqualified from sitting in the house of\r\ncommons was carried by two only. So far did pressure from without\r\ncombined with the near prospect of a general election carry the commons,\r\nbut the majority did not desire reform and would go no further than\r\ngeneral resolutions. An address to the king, praying that he would not\r\ndissolve nor prorogue parliament until measures had been taken to\r\ndiminish the influence of the crown, was rejected by a majority of\r\nfifty-one. The struggle was over, and Fox vented his rage and\r\ndisappointment in a speech of unmeasured invective. Throughout the\r\nsession much heated language was used in parliament, and both Shelburne\r\nand Fox fought duels in consequence of words uttered by them in debate.\r\nOn June 2 Richmond, ultra-democratic as a democratic noble is wont to\r\nbe, specially on questions not affecting his own order, was urging\r\nannual parliaments and manhood suffrage on the lords when he was\r\ninterrupted by an outbreak of mob violence, a bitter answer to his\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE GORDON RIOTS._]\r\n\r\nThe earlier half of the reign saw an increase in religious tolerance.\r\nThough the whig movement for relieving dissenting ministers from\r\nsubscription to the articles was defeated by the lords in 1772 and 1773,\r\na bill supported by both parties granted them relief in 1779, the year\r\nin which the Irish dissenters were relieved from the test act. The\r\nwhigs, as we have seen with reference to the Quebec act, were opposed to\r\nany measure of relief being granted to Roman catholics, who were by law\r\nliable to cruel oppression. The judges, indeed, and specially the great\r\nchief-justice, Mansfield, did all they could to mitigate the rigour of\r\nthe law, yet catholics lived in insecurity, and so late as 1767 a priest\r\nwas condemned to imprisonment for life, and was actually imprisoned for\r\nfour years, for exercising his office. Whig prejudices gave way, and in\r\n1778 Sir George Savile brought in a bill enabling catholics who abjured\r\nthe temporal jurisdiction of the pope to purchase and inherit land, and\r\nfreeing their priests from liability to imprisonment. The bill, which\r\nonly affected England, was passed without a division in either house,\r\nand the government proposed to bring in a like bill for Scotland the\r\nnext year. Violent protestant riots took place in Edinburgh and Glasgow,\r\nand such strong feeling was generally manifested in Scotland against the\r\nproposed measure that it was abandoned. The relief act excited\r\ndiscontent in England, and protestant fanatics, encouraged by the\r\nsuccess of their party in Scotland, agitated for its repeal. A\r\nprotestant association was formed, a crack-brained member of parliament,\r\nLord George Gordon, was made president, and a petition for the repeal of\r\nthe act was signed by nearly 120,000 persons.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1780, some 60,000 persons marched under Gordon's leadership\r\nto Westminster with their monster petition. They violently assaulted\r\nmany peers and compelled members of both houses to cry No popery! and to\r\nput blue cockades in their hats. Gordon addressed them, and named Burke\r\nand other members as specially hostile to their cause. The commons\r\nrefused to give the petition immediate consideration; the lobbies were\r\nthronged by the mob, and North sent for the lifeguards to protect\r\nparliament. On their arrival the mob left palace-yard and partially\r\ndestroyed the chapels of the Sardinian embassy in Duke street, Lincoln's\r\ninn Fields and the Bavarian embassy in Warwick street, Golden square.\r\nThe next day was fairly quiet, but on Sunday, the 4th, finding that no\r\nmeasures were taken to enforce order, they sacked other catholic chapels\r\nand some houses. By Monday the riots assumed a more dangerous character;\r\nthe mob passed out of the leadership of religious fanatics and was bent\r\non plunder and destruction. East of Charing Cross London was almost at\r\nits mercy. There was no efficient police force; military officers and\r\nsoldiers had learnt the risk they would incur by firing on a mob without\r\nthe order of the civil power, and the magistrates were for the most part\r\ntimid and inactive. Wilkes was an honourable exception, and showed\r\ncourage and firmness in dealing with the rioters. Virtually unchecked,\r\nthe mob sacked chapels and houses, plundered shops, and burnt Savile's\r\nfurniture before his door. During the next two days Newgate was partly\r\nburnt and the prison broken open, the other principal prisons either\r\ndestroyed or damaged and the prisoners set at liberty. Some magistrates'\r\nhouses were plundered and burnt. Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury square\r\nwas sacked and his splendid library, pictures, plate, and furniture\r\ndestroyed. By Wednesday night thirty-six fires were blazing in different\r\nparts; volumes of flame were rising from the King's bench and Fleet\r\nprisons, the new Bridewell, and the toll gates on Blackfriars bridge,\r\nand the lower end of Holborn was burning fiercely. A great distillery in\r\nHolborn was wrecked; men and women killed themselves by drinking the\r\nunrectified spirits which were brought into the streets, and others who\r\nwere drunk perished in the flames or were buried in the ruins. Attacks\r\nwere made on the Bank of England and the Pay Office. Both were guarded\r\nby soldiers, and the rioters were repulsed with heavy loss.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S PERSONAL INTERVENTION._]\r\n\r\nBy that time the general paralysis of authority was ended by the king's\r\npersonal intervention. As his ministers seemed afraid of incurring\r\nresponsibility, George summoned a meeting of the council by special\r\ncommand on Wednesday morning. Finding that the council hesitated to\r\nrecommend the employment of troops, he said that if they would not give\r\nhim advice he would act without it, and that he could answer for one\r\nmagistrate who would do his duty. He bade Wedderburn, the\r\nattorney-general, declare the law on the subject. Wedderburn replied\r\nthat the king in council could order soldiers to suppress a riot without\r\nthe authority of a magistrate. George at once ordered the military to\r\nact, and by Thursday morning the riots were quelled. Seventy-two houses\r\nand four gaols had been destroyed. Of the rioters, 285 were reported as\r\nkilled and 173 wounded, but many more lost their lives during the riots.\r\nThe trials of the rioters were conducted with moderation; of the 139 who\r\nwere tried, fifty-nine were capitally convicted, and of these only\r\ntwenty-one were executed. The Surrey prisoners were tried before\r\nWedderburn, who was made chief-justice of the common pleas and created\r\nLord Loughborough. Lord George Gordon was acquitted; he was imprisoned\r\nfor a libel in 1787, and died in Newgate after having become a jew. When\r\nthe lords, who adjourned on the 6th, again assembled, the great jurist\r\nMansfield, who in his seventy-sixth year retained his mastery of\r\nconstitutional law and his facility of expression, authoritatively\r\ndeclared that soldiers equally with civil persons might, and if required\r\nby a magistrate must, assist in suppressing riots and preventing acts of\r\ntreason and felony, and that the red coat of a soldier neither\r\ndisqualified him from performing the duty of a citizen nor would protect\r\nhim if he transgressed it. The riots seem to have improved the position\r\nof the government, for the appeal to popular feeling and the formation\r\nof associations by which the whigs brought pressure on parliament were\r\ndiscredited by them, and for the moment common danger allayed political\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[135] _Parl.

From early times all belligerent nations subjected to capture\r\nthe goods of an enemy in neutral ships. This usage was interrupted only\r\nby treaties. It was specially disliked by the Dutch, as great carriers\r\nby sea, and they made many treaties with different powers, stipulating\r\nthat goods carried in their ships, not being contraband, should be free.\r\nIn 1778 France, in order to injure England, declared its adoption of the\r\nprinciple that neutral ships made neutral goods. The lesser Baltic\r\nnations, which largely exported naval material, were anxious to protect\r\ntheir commerce from England, specially as she was rigorous in her view\r\nwith regard to contraband goods; and they looked to Russia to help them.\r\nFrederick of Prussia, always eager to do England a bad turn, used his\r\ninfluence with the Empress Catherine in the cause of the freedom of\r\ncommerce in neutral ships, and was supported by her minister, Panin.\r\nCatherine, though not unfriendly towards England, yielded to his\r\nrepresentations, and in March, 1780, notified England, France, and Spain\r\nthat, while in other respects she would maintain strict neutrality, she\r\nwould enforce by her fleets four propositions: (1) that neutral ships\r\nmay freely sail from port to port of a belligerent nation; (2) that\r\ngoods carried by them, not being contraband, should be free from\r\nseizure; (3) that only certain specified goods were contraband; and (4)\r\nthat no blockade should be recognised which was not effectual. France,\r\nSpain, and the Americans at once accepted these propositions; Denmark,\r\nSweden, Prussia, and the Emperor joined the league of \"armed neutrality\"\r\nin the course of the year, and the accession of Holland was only\r\nprevented by its becoming a belligerent. England did not accept these\r\nnew rules, which were detrimental to her as a naval power. The alliance\r\nisolated her, threatened to increase the number of her enemies, and\r\nforced her to be cautious in her dealings with neutral ships. War with\r\nthe Baltic powers would have ruined her, for since the American revolt\r\nshe was dependent on these countries for timber and other naval stores.\r\nHappily, Catherine was by no means inclined to quarrel with her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE QUARREL WITH HOLLAND._]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch complained that England violated a treaty made with them in\r\n1674, which provided that either power should hold all goods conveyed in\r\nthe ships of the other, not being contraband, as free from liability of\r\nseizure, and that either should be free to trade with the enemies of the\r\nother. Many Dutch ships were searched and their cargoes seized by\r\nEnglish ships, in some cases lawfully, because they were carrying\r\ncontraband of war, in others merely because they were carrying French\r\ngoods or were trading with our enemies. England contended that the\r\ntreaty of 1674 was superseded by the treaties of 1678 and 1716, which\r\nprovided that, when either power was attacked, the other should come to\r\nits aid; and that, though the aid of the Dutch was not demanded, they\r\nwere at least bound to abstain from helping her enemies. The Dutch,\r\nhowever, supplied the Americans with vast quantities of naval and\r\nmilitary stores, supplied naval stores also to France and Spain, and\r\nallowed American privateers, and notably Paul Jones, to refit and equip\r\ntheir ships and to sell their prizes in Dutch ports. The British\r\nambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, remonstrated strongly against these\r\nunfriendly acts on the part of a nation in close alliance with his\r\nsovereign. He could gain no satisfaction; for though the party of the\r\nstadholder was anxious to keep on friendly terms, the pensionary and the\r\ncity of Amsterdam were violently opposed to England, and the merchants\r\ngenerally were on their side. Late in 1779 a fleet of Dutch merchantmen,\r\nladen with timber and naval stores for France, and sailing under the\r\nconvoy of an admiral, was met by an English squadron. The Dutch fired on\r\nthe boats sent to search their ships; the English returned the fire,\r\ncaptured some of the ships, and brought them into Spithead. Bitter\r\ncomplaints were made on both sides, and the Dutch, encouraged by the\r\ndeclaration of the armed neutrality and the influence of France and\r\nPrussia, showed no inclination to yield to Yorke's remonstrances.\r\n\r\nAt last England had an opportunity of putting an end to this course of\r\nunacknowledged hostility. In October, 1780, a British frigate captured\r\nan American packet which was carrying Laurens, lately president of\r\ncongress, as ambassador to Holland. He threw his papers overboard, but a\r\nBritish seaman promptly went after them and brought them back. Among\r\nthem was a draft of a proposed treaty of commerce and amity between\r\nHolland and the United States of America, signed by the pensionary of\r\nAmsterdam and Lee, an American envoy, in September, 1778, when Holland\r\nwas bound by treaty to a close alliance with Great Britain. England\r\ndemanded a disavowal of the treaty and the punishment of the pensionary.\r\nThe states-general voted to join the armed neutrality and, while\r\ndisavowing the treaty, did not proceed against the pensionary. England\r\ndeclared war on December 20. The opposition maintained that the\r\ngovernment had behaved arrogantly and was actuated by a desire for\r\nplunder, and that it was unjust to found a war on a mere proposal\r\nemanating from the magistracy of a single city and not confirmed by the\r\nstates-general. Yet, if the conduct of Holland is viewed as a whole, it\r\nwill be found to justify the course pursued by the government. England,\r\nthen, in addition to the war with her rebellious colonies, had to meet\r\nthe forces of France, Spain, and Holland. Nevertheless, the new\r\naccession to the number of her foes was of no detriment to her, for the\r\nDutch were no longer powerful: it was better to have them open enemies\r\nthan treacherous friends; England's geographical position enabled her to\r\nprevent their fleet from joining those of her other enemies, and their\r\ncommerce and colonies fell an easy prey to her ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEFENCE OF GIBRALTAR._]\r\n\r\nThe recovery of Gibraltar was the principal object for which Spain\r\nfought. During some negotiations for peace carried on by unaccredited\r\nBritish agents in 1780, the Spanish minister, Florida Blanca, avowed\r\nthat for the sake of Gibraltar his master would \"break the family\r\ncompact and every other engagement with France\". Germain was willing\r\nthat the question should be discussed, but North forbade the British\r\nagents to let the word Gibraltar pass their lips, and Stormont declared\r\nthat the map of Spain's empire contained no equivalent for it, so the\r\nnegotiations were ineffectual.[145] The Spaniards made strenuous\r\nefforts to take the fortress. On the night of June 6 they delivered a\r\nsudden attack on the small squadron in the harbour with fire-ships and a\r\ncrowd of boats. They were foiled by the valour of the British seamen\r\nwho, under a heavy fire, grappled the blazing ships and towed them\r\nashore. Again Eliott found himself in urgent need of supplies; food and\r\nammunition alike ran short, and early in 1781 it became evident that the\r\nplace would have to be surrendered unless it was speedily relieved.\r\nAdmiral Darby, then in command of the channel fleet, took out a convoy\r\nwith supplies. The French were occupied with their own schemes of\r\nconquest, the Spanish fleet did not dare to meet him, and the relief was\r\naccomplished on April 12. The Spaniards then tried to reduce the place\r\nby a continuous bombardment, and between the 10th of that month and the\r\nend of June threw into it 75,000 shot and 25,000 shells. At first Eliott\r\nreplied even more fiercely; but, always careful of his ammunition, he\r\nrelaxed his fire on finding that the Spanish bombardment did him small\r\nharm, for though the town was virtually destroyed, the garrison lost\r\nonly fifty-three killed and 260 wounded, and the fortifications were not\r\nseriously damaged. While Spain was thus foiled in her principal effort,\r\nshe completed the reduction of West Florida, and her ships increased the\r\nrisks which attended the commerce of England. In August, 1780, a fleet\r\nof East and West Indiamen, convoyed by Captain Moutray, was attacked by\r\nthe combined fleets of France and Spain, under Don Luis de Cordova;\r\nfifty-five were taken and brought into Cadiz harbour, at a loss to Great\r\nBritain of about L2,000,000, besides 1,800 soldiers who were on their\r\nway to India.\r\n\r\nNear home the enemies of England accomplished little. In January about\r\n800 French soldiers landed in Jersey and surprised St. Heliers. The\r\nisland was saved by Major Pierson of the 95th, gallantly supported by\r\nsuch troops and militia as he could gather at once. All the invaders\r\nwere either killed or taken prisoners, but Pierson fell at the moment of\r\nvictory. In July the combined fleets of France and Spain convoyed 14,000\r\ntroops on their way to Minorca, where they besieged Fort St. Philip,\r\nwhich held out until the next year. They then sailed, forty-nine ships\r\nof the line, into the mouth of the Channel and cruised about on the\r\nlook-out for convoys. Darby lay in Torbay with thirty ships of the\r\nline, and they did not dare to attack him; many of their ships were\r\nunseaworthy, and in September the fleets for a second time retreated\r\nfrom the Channel without accomplishing anything. Meanwhile the Dutch\r\nwere rendered incapable of acting with them. As Admiral Hyde Parker, in\r\ncommand of a squadron, was convoying the Baltic trade homeward on August\r\n5, he met with a Dutch squadron on the Dogger Bank convoying their trade\r\nto the north. The two squadrons were nominally nearly equal, but several\r\nof the English ships were in bad condition. There was no manoeuvring;\r\nboth sides went at it in the old fashion, fighting ship with ship all\r\nalong the line. Both squadrons were desperately hammered, and at last\r\nparted without definite result. The Dutch loss in men was heavy; one of\r\ntheir best ships was sunk and two others totally ruined. They became\r\nlittle more than spectators of the war, and their possessions in the\r\nEast, Sumatra, Negapatam, and Trincomali, fell into the hands of the\r\nEnglish. Parker was furious with Sandwich for sending him out with an\r\ninsufficient and badly found force. George went down to the Nore and\r\nvisited his ship in the hope of appeasing him, but the old admiral\r\ninsisted on resigning his command, and when pressed to remain, bluntly\r\ntold the king that he wished him \"younger men and newer ships\".\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE NEW PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nThe temporary success of the opposition in the spring of 1780 showed the\r\nking that he could no longer reckon with certainty on the support of the\r\nhouse of commons. On September 1 he suddenly dissolved the parliament\r\nelected in 1774, and writs were issued for a new parliament to meet on\r\nOctober 31. The suddenness of the dissolution and the shortness of the\r\ntime allowed for the new elections were held to operate in favour of the\r\ncourt. Nor did George neglect other means of securing his authority, for\r\nhe told North that the general election cost at least twice as much as\r\nany other since his accession.[146] Rodney headed the poll for\r\nWestminster, but Fox secured the second seat, defeating a ministerial\r\ncandidate. Bristol, doubly offended by Burke's efforts on behalf of\r\nIrish trade and catholic relief, rejected him as its member, and he was\r\nprovided with a seat by Rockingham. Windsor refused to re-elect Keppel,\r\nand it is asserted that George so far forgot his position as to go into\r\nthe shop of a silk-mercer of the borough, and say in his hurried way:\r\n\"The queen wants a gown, wants a gown. No Keppel! No Keppel!\"[147] Among\r\nthe new members were Sheridan, the dramatist, and manager and part-owner\r\nof Drury lane theatre, one of Fox's friends, who became famous as an\r\norator, and William Pitt, the second son of the great Chatham, who was\r\nreturned for Appleby on Sir James Lowther's nomination in January, 1781,\r\nwhen he was in his twenty-second year. From early youth Pitt showed\r\nsigns of a remarkable genius which was carefully cultivated by his\r\nfather. Conscious of his ability, he was reserved in manner, though he\r\nwas warmly attached to his intimate friends and talked freely with them.\r\nHe lived wholly for the service of his country, and took no part in the\r\npleasures or vices of his contemporaries, save that he habitually drank\r\nfar too much port wine. He joined the opposition, and ranged himself\r\nwith his father's old followers who acted under Shelburne's leadership.\r\nOn all questions of importance he spoke with lofty eloquence, and his\r\nspeeches, often splendid as oratory, had the surpassing excellence of\r\nappealing to his hearers by raising them to a higher level of thought\r\nand feeling than that from which they had previously regarded the matter\r\nin debate. His voice was rich, his words well chosen, and he was\r\nsingularly happy in sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThe king's influence was strong in the new parliament. Sir Fletcher\r\nNorton, a bad-tempered and unprincipled man, who had deeply offended him\r\nby his speech with reference to the civil list in 1777, was again\r\nproposed as speaker by the opposition, and was rejected by 203 votes to\r\n134 in favour of Cornwall, the ministerial candidate. The session opened\r\nlanguidly and the attendance of the opposition was scanty. After the\r\nChristmas recess the struggle with the government was carried on with\r\nmore energy. Little ground was gained. Burke's bill for a reform of the\r\ncivil list establishment was rejected by 233 to 190, and a like fate\r\nattended other efforts to destroy the means by which parliament was\r\nsubjected to corrupt influences. Though the Dutch war was popular\r\nspecially with the mercantile class, which expected to benefit by it,\r\nboth the nation and the parliament were thoroughly weary of the\r\nAmerican war, and the opponents of it in the commons were strengthened\r\nby the accession of Pitt who pronounced it \"a most accursed, wicked,\r\nbarbarous, cruel, unnatural, unjust, and diabolical war\".[148] Yet the\r\nnews of successes in the south, of a mutiny of the Pennsylvania troops\r\nin January, 1781, and of the distress and financial difficulties of the\r\nAmericans encouraged the government party. Motions hostile to the war\r\nwere feebly supported, and Fox's jeers at British victories, and his\r\ndeclarations that the money spent on the war was plundered from the\r\nnation, that the cause of the Americans was \"the cause of freedom, of\r\nthe constitution, and of whiggism, and that he had in its origin wished\r\nit success,\" excited justifiable indignation.\r\n\r\nThe most serious attack on the government was caused by North's\r\ndisgraceful manipulation of a loan of L12,000,000. Though more than\r\nthree times the amount was offered, the loan was arranged on terms so\r\nadvantageous to the lenders that the price of the new stock rose at once\r\nfrom 9 per cent. to 11 per cent. above par. The profits were calculated\r\nby Fox to amount to L900,000, and, as in 1763, the loan was distributed\r\namong the supporters of the government, half of it, so it was said,\r\ngoing to members of the house of commons, whether as compensation for\r\nelection expenses or generally as a means of maintaining a corrupt\r\ninfluence. North's conduct was severely reprehended in both chambers,\r\nand in two divisions on the question in the commons the opposition voted\r\n106 to 137 and 163 to 209. The life of the government depended on the\r\nfortunes of the war in America; it was prolonged by gleams of success;\r\nit was soon to be terminated by an overwhelming disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1780 the Americans were, perhaps, more disheartened\r\nthan at any other period of the war. They were, as we shall see, losing\r\nin the south, and their hope of decisive help from France was again\r\ndisappointed. Congress continued to issue paper money until its notes\r\nbecame of so little value that ten paper dollars were exchanged for a\r\ncent; there was no money and no credit, and Washington was forced to\r\nlevy contributions on the surrounding country to supply his army. The\r\npeople generally were sick of the war. France was almost bankrupt; even\r\nVergennes was weary of American demands for help, and suggested putting\r\nan end to the war by a long truce, the English surrendering New York and\r\nkeeping Georgia and South Carolina. The idea was equally displeasing to\r\nthe king and to the Americans. It was not without reason that George\r\nbelieved that \"America was distressed to the greatest degree,\" and that\r\nif his ministers persevered in the war they would wear down its power of\r\nresistance.[149]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MAJOR ANDRE._]\r\n\r\nThe depression of the Americans was deepened by the treachery of Arnold.\r\nConspicuous among their generals for energy and dash, he was a\r\nvulgar-minded, irritable man, ruined in fortune by his own extravagance,\r\nand with many enemies. He had been treated badly by congress, and was\r\nfinally maddened by receiving a public reprimand ordered by a\r\ncourt-martial which was held to examine charges affecting his probity.\r\nWashington felt kindly towards him, and gave him the command of West\r\nPoint, a highland fortress which was the key of the line of the Hudson.\r\nHe had for some time contemplated deserting to the British, and was in\r\ncorrespondence with Clinton, receiving replies through Major Andre, a\r\ngallant and popular young officer, Clinton's adjutant-general, who wrote\r\nunder the name of John Anderson. Determined to avenge himself on\r\ncongress, he offered to betray West Point to the British. An attack was\r\nto be made on September 25, and Arnold was to arrange the American\r\ntroops in such a way as to ensure its success. Had the plot succeeded,\r\nthe Americans would have lost communication between the northern and\r\nsouthern provinces, and would probably have been forced to give up the\r\nstruggle. An interview was necessary, and Andre sailed up the river in\r\nthe _Vulture_ sloop, and met Arnold secretly on the night of the 21st.\r\nAfter the interview Arnold persuaded him to take shelter in a house\r\nwhich, though he was not aware of it, stood within the American lines,\r\nand gave him papers containing arrangements for the attack. The next day\r\nAndre could not find a boatman to take him to the _Vulture_, and was\r\nforced to set out for New York by land. He had a pass from Arnold made\r\nout for John Anderson, he changed his uniform for a civilian dress, and\r\npassed the American lines in safety. On the 23rd he fell into the hands\r\nof some American cattle-stealers; Arnold's papers were found in his\r\nboots, and his captors handed him over to a militia officer. Arnold\r\nreceived tidings of his capture and made his escape on board the\r\n_Vulture_.\r\n\r\nAndre was tried by a court-martial consisting of fourteen general\r\nofficers, and was sentenced to death as a spy. Clinton made every effort\r\nto obtain his pardon; Washington was inexorable, and would not even\r\ngrant Andre's request that he might die a soldier's death. He was hanged\r\non October 2, and met his fate with dignity and courage. Inexpressibly\r\nsad as his end was, he was not treated unjustly; he entered the enemy's\r\nlines while attempting to assist their commander to betray his post, he\r\nwas within their lines in disguise, and he was taken with papers upon\r\nhim arranging the details of the betrayal. Washington would have been\r\nheld to have acted with generosity if he had treated him as a prisoner\r\nof war, or even if he had granted his pathetic request that he might be\r\nspared the ignominy of the gallows. But an officer in command should not\r\nallow any consideration to hinder him from doing what he believes to be\r\nbest for his army, provided it is not contrary to the usages of\r\ncivilised warfare. That Washington was guided by this principle in\r\nsending Andre to the gallows may fairly be inferred from all we know of\r\nhis character, and of the condition of the American army at the time.\r\nHis conduct needs no other defence.[150] The traitor Arnold received\r\nL6,300 from the British government, and, it is painful to remember, a\r\ncommission in the army, which he entered with a brevet of\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RODNEY AT ST. EUSTATIUS._]\r\n\r\nAs soon as war was declared with the Dutch, orders were sent to Rodney,\r\nwho returned from America to the Antilles at the end of 1780, to capture\r\nSt. Eustatius. From a mass of barren rock this Dutch island had suddenly\r\nbecome a place of first-rate commercial importance. In order to supply\r\nour West India planters with food for their slaves, parliament allowed\r\ntrade to be carried on there with the Americans. In St. Eustatius the\r\ngoods of all nations were bought and sold; and British and French\r\nplanters, American dealers and Dutch merchants traded with one another\r\nas in a time of peace. English planters and merchants also used it as a\r\nplace of deposit, believing that their goods would be safer there than\r\nin their own islands, which were open to attacks from the French. The\r\nwealth of the island was prodigious; the rents of the dwellings and\r\nwarehouses hastily constructed on it amounted to a million a year; it\r\nhad, as Burke said, risen from the waters like another Tyre to become\r\nthe mart of the world. Like the British island of Nassau during the\r\nAmerican civil war, it carried on along with legitimate commerce a brisk\r\ncontraband trade, and its merchants supplied the Americans and French,\r\ntheir principal and most favoured customers, with vast quantities of\r\nnaval stores and ammunition. It was practically undefended, and,\r\ntogether with its dependencies, St. Martin and Saba, was surrendered to\r\nRodney without resistance on February 3, 1781. Over 150 vessels were\r\ntaken in the bay, besides a richly laden convoy of Dutch ships which had\r\nlately put to sea. Rodney held that the island was a \"nest of villains,\"\r\nand that its \"infamous and deceitful inhabitants\" owed their wealth to\r\ntheir support of the king's enemies by contraband trading; they\r\n\"deserved scourging,\" and he vowed that they should get it. He\r\nconfiscated all the property on the island, private as well as public,\r\nsave what belonged to the French, who were open enemies. There was much\r\ntruth in his indictment, but his indiscriminate confiscation was\r\nmonstrously unjust.\r\n\r\nThe spoil of the island was estimated at L4,000,000. The king granted\r\nhis rights over the booty to the captors. Rodney was a poor man, and was\r\ngreedy for wealth; he seized more than the king could grant, or he could\r\nlawfully hold, for part of the booty belonged to English merchants. His\r\nconduct was severely and, though with some exaggeration, justly attacked\r\nby Burke in parliament, and in after years he was harassed by suits\r\nbrought against him for unlawful spoliation. The booty sold on the spot\r\nfetched far less than its value, and much that was sent home fell into\r\nthe hands of the French; for while Darby was engaged in the relief of\r\nGibraltar, a French squadron intercepted the convoy which was bringing\r\nit to England, and carried off several ships laden with spoil. The\r\ncapture of the island proved disastrous to England. A French fleet under\r\nCount de Grasse was unfortunately allowed to leave Brest in March, for\r\nEngland was embarrassed by naval conflicts all over the world. Rodney\r\nexpected its coming, and sent Sir Samuel Hood, as fine a seaman as\r\nhimself, and with a more single eye to the king's service, to blockade\r\nFort Royal, in Martinique, in order to prevent four French ships which\r\nlay there from joining Grasse. Hood wished to cruise to windward of the\r\nisland, which would have enabled him to force Grasse either to fight or\r\nto give up his junction with the four ships. Rodney, who remained at St.\r\nEustatius looking after the loot, would not consent to this, because, so\r\nHood asserts, he was afraid that the ships would slip out and attack the\r\nisland.[151] Hood was forced to keep to leeward; Grasse got between him\r\nand the island, was joined by the ships, and so gained the superiority\r\nin force. Some distant and indecisive fighting took place on April 29\r\nand 30, and finally Hood, being the inferior in force, and no longer\r\nhaving any reason to risk his ships, sailed away from the enemy. The\r\nFrench, though failing in an attack on St. Lucia, took Tobago, and, what\r\nwas of graver consequence, Grasse was enabled, apparently through\r\nRodney's anxiety concerning his booty, to maintain a strong fleet in the\r\nWest Indies, which before long helped to bring victory within reach of\r\nthe Americans. Grasse sailed for the American coast in August. Rodney\r\nwas obliged by ill-health to return to England, and left Hood with only\r\nfourteen ships to follow the French fleet, directing him to join Admiral\r\nGraves, then in command in the American waters, in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Chesapeake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CORNWALLIS IN SOUTH CAROLINA._]\r\n\r\nAs the British forces were divided between New York and the southern\r\nprovinces, it is obvious that the issue of the struggle depended on the\r\ncommand of the sea. So long as the British held the ocean way, the\r\nsouthern army would be able to receive reinforcements and supplies, and\r\ncould be aided by diversions, the French alliance would be of little\r\nprofit to the Americans, and the long land journey, expensive and open\r\nto attacks, would cut off the southern provinces from succours from the\r\nnorth. The navy, as both Clinton and Washington saw, \"had the casting\r\nvote in the contest\".[152] In July, 1780, soon after Clinton returned to\r\nNew York from South Carolina, a French squadron brought nearly 6,000\r\nmen, commanded by Count de Rochambeau, to Rhode Island. A few days\r\nafter the arrival of Rochambeau, the British fleet under Arbuthnot\r\nreceived reinforcements which made it stronger than the French. Clinton\r\ntook measures for attacking the French by land and sea, but was called\r\nback to New York by a movement on the part of Washington, and a renewal\r\nof the plan was defeated by a quarrel between him and Arbuthnot. The\r\nseven French ships remained at Newport, blocked up by the British fleet,\r\nand though Washington obtained some help from the land force, the\r\ngreater part stayed to guard the ships. Rodney should have attacked\r\nthese ships as soon as he arrived at New York in September. He probably\r\nthought them of little importance, as they were thoroughly blockaded,\r\nand did not care to risk his ships within reach of the French batteries\r\non the shore. The destruction of the squadron was within his power and\r\nwas well worth some risk. Great as he was on sea, he did not understand\r\nthe wide aspects of operations of war. The presence of the French\r\ncompelled the British to keep a large force in New York and so hindered\r\ntheir operations in the south.\r\n\r\nBefore Clinton left South Carolina, he issued a proclamation which put\r\nan end to all hopes of neutrality; those who would not fulfil the duties\r\nof loyal subjects would be held to be rebels. This step caused many who\r\nwould willingly have remained neutral to join the revolutionists rather\r\nthan fight against them. The country soon became disturbed; the British\r\nwere forced to act with severity, and the Americans, both revolutionists\r\nand loyalists, behaved with great cruelty towards their\r\nfellow-countrymen of the opposite party.[153] Partisan leaders, among\r\nwhom Sumter and Marion were conspicuous, raised bands on their own\r\nresponsibility, and fought against the British, acting sometimes\r\nindependently and sometimes in conjunction with the forces of congress.\r\nCornwallis worked energetically at Charleston, enrolling militia and\r\nproviding for the administration, while Lord Rawdon with the main body\r\nof the army kept the border at Camden. Anxious to press on, Cornwallis\r\ndesired Clinton to send a force to Chesapeake bay, to divert the enemy\r\nwhile he invaded North Carolina; but before he could advance further he\r\nhad to fight for the southern province. Gates was appointed to the\r\nsupreme command in the south and was threatening Camden. Cornwallis\r\nhastened thither with his staff and found Rawdon with 700 sick and less\r\nthan 2,000 fit for duty. The enemy was greatly superior in number,\r\nwithout reckoning 1,000 men under Sumter, who was cutting the British\r\noff from their supplies on the west side of the Wateree river.\r\nCornwallis met them on August 16, and began the engagement with a\r\nvigorous attack on the American left, formed by the Virginia and North\r\nCarolina militia who, as the British advanced, firing and cheering,\r\nthrew down their arms and fled. The British victory was complete; the\r\nAmericans lost about 1,000 killed and wounded, over 1,000 prisoners, and\r\ntheir artillery and stores; the British casualties were 324. Two days\r\nlater Colonel Tarleton smartly surprised Sumter, and dispersed his band,\r\nretaking a convoy which had fallen into his hands shortly before the\r\nbattle of Camden. The defeat of Gates's army drove the Americans almost\r\nto despair.\r\n\r\nCornwallis was encouraged to pursue his grand plan of \"conquest from\r\nsouth to north\". Clinton, though he did not approve of his forward\r\npolicy,[154] sent General Leslie with 3,200 men to Chesapeake bay to\r\nco-operate with him, and Cornwallis entered North Carolina and advanced\r\nas far as Charlotte. In spite of his brilliant victory he was beset by\r\ndifficulties. The loyalists did not give him the help which he expected;\r\nas soon as he left South Carolina it broke into a ferment of\r\ndisaffection, and his troops were not suited for the guerilla warfare\r\nlargely adopted by the enemy, who were, Rawdon wrote, \"mostly mounted\r\nmilitia not to be overtaken by our infantry, nor to be safely pursued in\r\nthis strong country by our cavalry\".[155] In this as in many other\r\nrespects, the experiences of the war were repeated in South Africa in\r\nour own day. Before Cornwallis left South Carolina he detached a force\r\nof 800 militia and 100 regulars under Major Ferguson to scour the border\r\nand keep the country quiet in the rear of the army. They were met by a\r\npartisan army of 3,000 men under different leaders at King's Mountain on\r\nOctober 7; Ferguson was killed and all his men were either slain or\r\ncaptured. So severe a loss, combined with the anxiety of Cornwallis lest\r\nthe important post called Ninety-six should be taken, put a stop to any\r\nfurther advance. Cornwallis fell back on Winnsborough, and bade Leslie\r\nconvey his force to Charleston, which he was able to do as England had\r\ncommand of the sea, and reinforce him. The safety of the border was his\r\nfirst care. No sooner had Tarleton checked the inroads of Marion in the\r\neast than he was summoned westwards to protect Ninety-six from Sumter.\r\nHe engaged Sumter's force at Blackstock on November 20, and claimed to\r\nhave defeated him. Tarleton was a dashing cavalry officer, given to\r\noverrating his own achievements. His troops were few and weary, and at\r\nbest he escaped defeat; but Sumter's band dispersed, for its leader was\r\nwounded and disabled for a while from further action.[156]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF THE COWPENS._]\r\n\r\nIn December Greene, a general of far greater ability than Gates, took\r\nthe chief command in the south. Cornwallis found the enemy on both his\r\nflanks. On the east Marion, then in common with Sumter holding a\r\ncommission from congress, Henry Lee, and Greene himself endangered his\r\ncommunications with the coast, and penetrated as far as Georgetown, and\r\non the west another division under Morgan threatened Ninety-six.\r\nDisaffection was spreading rapidly through the province. Believing that\r\nhis one chance of conquering from south to north lay in pushing forward,\r\nhe determined to march into North Carolina. Leslie joined him in\r\nJanuary, 1781, and Clinton sent Arnold and Phillips with a large force\r\nto take Leslie's place in Virginia. On setting out for North Carolina,\r\nCornwallis detached Tarleton to deal with Morgan. He brought him to bay\r\nat the Cowpens, near King's Mountain, on the 17th. Tarleton's force,\r\nnumbering about 1,100, was slightly superior to that of the enemy, but\r\nhe engaged while his men were weary after a hard night-march. Some of\r\nhis troops behaved badly; he was utterly defeated, and lost nearly 800\r\nmen. This defeat was a severe blow to Cornwallis, for it deprived him of\r\nthe best part of his light troops, which were specially necessary for\r\nhis march through a wooded and thinly populated country where much\r\nforaging had to be done. He determined to advance, hoping to get between\r\nGreene and Virginia, and force him to fight before he received\r\nreinforcements. He burnt his superfluous baggage and crossed the Catawba\r\nriver. The two divisions of the American army retreated hastily through\r\nNorth Carolina, succeeded in forming a junction, and crossed the Dan\r\ninto Virginia before the British could come up with them. Having thus\r\ncleared the province of the revolutionary troops, Cornwallis encamped at\r\nHillsborough, and on February 20 summoned the loyalists to join him.\r\nSome were coming in when, on the 23rd, Greene, who had received\r\nreinforcements, recrossed the Dan. Any further loyalist movement was\r\nstopped by an act of revolting barbarity; 200 loyalists were caught by\r\nLee's horse on their way to the British quarters; they made no\r\nresistance and asked for quarter, but were butchered by their\r\nfellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nCornwallis, finding it difficult to support his troops and being anxious\r\nto encourage the loyalists by showing his superiority in the field,\r\naccepted Greene's offer of battle at Guilford courthouse on March 15.\r\nHis force scarcely numbered 2,000, while the enemy, regulars and\r\nmilitia, were 4,300 strong. The battle was begun by the British left,\r\nconsisting of the 22nd and 23rd regiments, supported by grenadiers and\r\nguards, which charged and routed the first line of the enemy with the\r\nbayonet. The second line, formed by Virginians, stood steady and was not\r\ndriven back without a severe struggle; so too the First Maryland\r\nregiment, in the third line, repulsed the first attack upon it with\r\nheavy loss. The Second Marylanders fell back before a battalion of\r\nguards, who pressed heedlessly after them and were suddenly engaged by\r\nthe American dragoons. The guards fought fiercely, but were broken. For\r\na moment things looked awkward. Then the enemy was checked by the\r\nBritish artillery and the guards were rallied by their brigadier O'Hara,\r\nwho, though severely wounded, was still able to do good service. The\r\nBritish fought magnificently and won a brilliant victory. Yet it was\r\ndearly bought, for the loss of over 500 rank and file, a full third of\r\nhis infantry, left Cornwallis powerless. His little army was in need of\r\nsupplies and he marched to Wilmington, where stores brought by sea were\r\nlaid up for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CORNWALLIS ADVANCES INTO VIRGINIA._]\r\n\r\nBeing too weak to do anything further without reinforcements, he decided\r\nto leave the Carolinas, effect a junction with Arnold in Virginia, and\r\nattempt the conquest of that province, reckoning that success there\r\nwould check disaffection in South Carolina and ultimately tend to the\r\nconquest of North Carolina.[157] He wished Clinton to prosecute the war\r\nin Virginia with all the strength at his command, even at the expense of\r\ngiving up New York. Clinton, however, was throughout opposed to his\r\nforward policy; he would have had him attempt nothing beyond the power\r\nof the force which he left with him, \"the defence of South, and most\r\nprobably the reduction of North, Carolina,\" and he did not intend the\r\ntroops sent to Virginia to engage in \"solid\" operations, which he judged\r\nto be inadvisable until he should himself take the field. The king and\r\nthe cabinet approved Cornwallis's line of action.[158] He advanced into\r\nVirginia on his own responsibility. This step led to unfriendly\r\nrelations between the two commanders, and after the war was the subject\r\nof a bitter controversy between them. Cornwallis effected a junction\r\nwith Arnold's army on May 20, and in command of over 5,000 troops\r\noverran the province, Lafayette, with a far inferior force, retreating\r\nbefore him. Meantime Rawdon struggled gallantly, though unsuccessfully,\r\nagainst Greene in South Carolina. He defeated Greene at Hobskirk hill on\r\nApril 25, but was forced to retire from Camden. The loyalists saw that\r\nthe British could not protect them; the whole province was disaffected,\r\nand post after post was taken by Greene, Lee, Sumter, Marion, and other\r\ngenerals. At last, after Rawdon's return to England on account of\r\nill-health, a hard-fought battle at Eutaw springs on September 8, which\r\nboth sides claimed as a victory, so weakened the British force that it\r\nremained in and about Charleston until it was withdrawn at the end of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nTo return to the spring of the year, Cornwallis's invasion of Virginia\r\nand the destruction of property there seemed likely to bring the war to\r\na successful issue. Washington's army was in grievous want of supplies,\r\nthe American marine was annihilated, their finances were in a ruinous\r\nstate, and their resources generally almost exhausted. Powerful\r\nco-operation with Cornwallis on the part of Clinton was urgently needed.\r\nThe issue of the struggle depended on the power of Great Britain to\r\nprevent a French fleet and army from undertaking a joint enterprise with\r\nthe Americans. At this critical juncture England lost the superiority at\r\nsea. In May, Washington and Rochambeau agreed that, as soon as Grasse\r\nbrought his fleet over, they would join forces, and either attack New\r\nYork or, perhaps, march into Virginia, as circumstances might direct.\r\nClinton discovered their design, would not spare any troops from New\r\nYork, and in June called on Cornwallis to send him part of the force\r\nunder his command, and ordered him to take up a defensive position.\r\nCornwallis retired down the James river to Portsmouth. Clinton withdrew\r\nhis demand for troops and directed him to fortify a station on the\r\nYorktown peninsula as a port for ships. He would there be able to take\r\nup a defensive position secured by access to the sea. Cornwallis\r\nconcentrated all his forces, about 7,000 men, and fortified Yorktown and\r\nGloucester. On July 6 Rochambeau, in expectation of the arrival of\r\nGrasse's fleet, brought his troops from Rhode Island (p. 219) and joined\r\nWashington at White Plains. It was agreed between Grasse and Washington\r\nthat the united army, 4,000 French and 2,000 Americans, should march\r\ninto Virginia and act in co-operation with the French fleet. Clinton,\r\nhowever, deceived by fictitious letters, written by Washington and\r\ndesigned to be intercepted, believed that it would attack New York, and\r\nremained quietly there while it marched half through New Jersey. Not\r\nuntil September 2 did he discover that it was on its way to join in a\r\ncombined attack on Cornwallis. On the 5th it reached the head of\r\nChesapeake bay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAPITULATION OF CORNWALLIS._]\r\n\r\nBy that time the inferiority of the British fleet rendered Cornwallis's\r\nsituation extremely perilous. When Hood with the fourteen ships of the\r\nline left by Rodney (p. 218) arrived off Cape Henry on August 25, Graves\r\nwas not there to meet him; he sailed to Sandy Hook and joined him. The\r\nfleet, nineteen ships of the line, sailed under Graves to Chesapeake\r\nbay, and found that during Hood's absence Grasse had entered the bay\r\nwith twenty-eight ships of the line. Grasse at once stood out to sea,\r\nfor he was anxious to secure a junction with the squadron from Newport,\r\nunder Count de Barras, which Rodney had failed to attack in the previous\r\nSeptember. Graves, who should have caught these ships instead of aiming\r\nat the main fleet, engaged him on September 5, handled his fleet badly,\r\nand got his ships knocked about. While he remained uselessly at sea the\r\nsquadron of Barras slipped into the bay. On the 14th the British fleet\r\nreturned to New York to refit, and Cornwallis was left without succour.\r\nLafayette with a large army of French and Americans was already blocking\r\nthe neck of the peninsula. Clinton attempted a perfectly useless\r\ndiversion in Connecticut under Arnold. Washington's army joined\r\nLafayette on the 18th, and Cornwallis was soon besieged by a force of\r\nover 16,000 men. On October 19 he was forced to capitulate. Of the\r\ngarrison which surrendered at Yorktown and Gloucester, 6,950 men, only\r\n4,017 remained fit for duty. On the day of the surrender, naval\r\nreinforcements having arrived at New York and the fleet at last being\r\nrefitted, Clinton sailed with 7,000 troops to the relief of Cornwallis.\r\nThey found that they were too late and returned to New York.\r\n\r\nWith this disaster the war in America virtually ended. Cornwallis in his\r\nattempt to recover the southern provinces showed a vigour and capacity\r\nwhich might, perhaps, have brought matters to a different issue if he\r\nhad held the chief command. But his means were inadequate to meet the\r\nwastage caused by battle and sickness; he found the loyalists a broken\r\nreed, and his troops not well suited to the kind of warfare in which\r\nthey were engaged. \"Had Lord Cornwallis staid in Carolina, as I had\r\nordered him,\" wrote Clinton, \"and I had even assembled my forces at New\r\nYork, and remained there with my arms across without affront, negative\r\nvictory would have insured American Dependence.\"[159] \"Arms across\"\r\nseems indeed to have been Clinton's favourite attitude.[160]\r\nCornwallis's advance into Virginia was certainly a risky movement, but\r\nit was a choice of evils and did not in itself entail disaster. Clinton\r\nreckoned, not without reason, that the Americans were too exhausted to\r\nprolong the struggle; he was in favour of desultory operations on the\r\nChesapeake, against Baltimore and Philadelphia, with the view of gaining\r\nloyalist support, and of waiting until he had received reinforcements\r\nlarge enough to enable him to undertake a \"solid\" campaign in Virginia,\r\nwithout leaving New York insufficiently defended. Cornwallis believed\r\nthat the best chance of success lay in securing a firm hold on Virginia.\r\nGermain, who still persisted in directing operations in America from\r\nLondon, considered Cornwallis's plan more promising than that of\r\nClinton. He treated Cornwallis as though he had an entirely independent\r\ncommand, with the result that serious misunderstandings arose between\r\nCornwallis and Clinton, the commander-in-chief, which hindered their\r\nco-operation; and while he approved of the plan adopted by Cornwallis he\r\ndid not discountenance Clinton's proposals, with the result that neither\r\ncourse of action was vigorously pursued. It was by Clinton's order that\r\nCornwallis retired to the York peninsula, where his safety depended on\r\nthe continued command of the sea; the choice of Yorktown as his post was\r\nhis own. It was not a good choice; but he had little reason to expect\r\nthat he would have to hold it against an overwhelming force of French\r\nand Americans, with a French fleet in command of the sea. Clinton should\r\nnot have been misled by Washington's simple trick into allowing the\r\ncombined force to advance beyond his reach on its way to crush\r\nCornwallis's army.\r\n\r\nThe true cause of the catastrophe, however, lay in naval mismanagement.\r\nThe mistaken policy of employing the British fleet in various and\r\ndistant enterprises instead of off the ports of the enemy enabled Grasse\r\nto sail from Brest unopposed. Rodney let slip a grand opportunity of\r\nbaulking his plans off Fort Royal, and sent, perhaps was forced to send,\r\nHood after him to America with an insufficient fleet. Partly through\r\naccident and partly through an error of judgment, Graves missed his\r\njunction with Hood. Grasse was consequently allowed quietly to enter\r\nChesapeake bay, and Graves afterwards failed to use his ships to the\r\nbest advantage. The loss of the command at sea was fatal to Cornwallis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MINISTRY LOSES GROUND._]\r\n\r\nTidings of the disaster reached London on November 25, two days before\r\nthe meeting of parliament. On receiving them North's habitual calmness\r\nbroke down; he threw up his arms as though he were shot, and repeatedly\r\nexclaimed, \"O God! it is all over!\" The king's fortitude was unshaken,\r\nand he showed no sign of agitation, save that, in acknowledging\r\nGermain's letter informing him of the surrender, he omitted to note the\r\nexact moment of his writing, as his custom was. The speech from the\r\nthrone at the opening of parliament, while acknowledging disaster,\r\ncontained no hint of giving way. Parliament for a while upheld the\r\nministers, and the address was carried in the lords by 75 to 31, and in\r\nthe commons by 218 to 129. Fox and Burke threatened the ministers with\r\nimpeachment and the scaffold; and Pitt condemned their policy in\r\nspeeches not less effective for being more moderate in tone. North\r\nannounced that the war would no longer be carried on with a design of\r\nconquest, but only for the possession of posts on the coast which would\r\nbe useful in the war with France and Spain. Crowded meetings in London\r\nand Westminster condemned the government. It was evident that there was\r\ndissension in the cabinet; North was anxious for an acknowledgment of\r\nAmerican independence, Germain declared that he would never agree to it.\r\nBy Christmas the government lost many supporters in parliament.\r\n\r\nIts position was further weakened by continued ill-success in war. The\r\nMarquis de Bouille retook St. Eustatius on October 25. Grasse returned\r\nto Martinique, and in January, 1782, the two commanders landed a force\r\non St. Kitts and besieged the garrison. Hood followed Grasse with\r\ntwenty-two ships, out-manoeuvred him brilliantly, beat him off on the\r\n26th, and held his station against a fleet of thirty-three ships of the\r\nline until February 14, when, as he was unable to prevent the fall of\r\nthe island, he sailed away. The capture of St. Kitts and Nevis reduced\r\nthe British possessions in the West Indies to Jamaica, Antigua, and\r\nBarbadoes. A joint attack on Jamaica was planned by France and Spain.\r\nRodney, however, again arrived at the Antilles with twelve ships, was\r\njoined by Hood, and, as we shall see in the next chapter, restored the\r\nBritish flag to its proper place at sea. Nearer home, Kempenfeldt, the\r\nadmiral whose tragic end is famous in Cowper's verse, dealt the enemy a\r\nsevere blow. He was sent, in December, 1781, with only twelve ships to\r\nintercept a French fleet consisting, as the admiralty knew, or ought to\r\nhave known, of seventeen ships with a convoy bound for the West Indies.\r\nKempenfeldt took at least twenty of the convoy with troops and stores,\r\nbut, overmatched as he was, he was forced to let the fleet sail on. It\r\nwas dispersed by a storm shortly afterwards, and many of the ships\r\nreturned home. The loss of this convoy seriously crippled the French in\r\nthe West Indies.[161] In the Mediterranean, the garrison of St. Philips,\r\nin Minorca, which had been besieged since August by a French and Spanish\r\narmy, was forced to surrender on February 5, after being reduced by\r\nsickness and war from 2,692 to 600 men fit for duty, and eighty years\r\nafter its conquest the island was lost to England.\r\n\r\nDuring the recess the ministers, convinced of the folly of prolonging\r\nthe war, arranged to go on without Germain. Carleton succeeded Clinton\r\nat New York, and Germain was succeeded as third secretary of state by\r\nthe insignificant Welbore Ellis, and was created Viscount Sackville,\r\nmuch to the wrath of the whig peers, who tried in vain to obtain a vote\r\nthat the presence of a cashiered officer was derogatory to the dignity\r\nof their house. The opposition gathered strength. A powerful attack by\r\nFox on the administration of the navy failed by twenty-two votes, a\r\nmotion by Conway for putting an end to the American war only by one, and\r\na like motion was carried a few days later by a majority of nineteen.\r\nThe government then introduced a bill to enable the king to make peace,\r\nand North sent envoys to Paris to sound Franklin as to terms. It was\r\nevident that the end was near, and the new government was eagerly\r\ndiscussed. Pitt, though acting with the opposition, took a somewhat\r\nindependent line, and announced in the house that he would not accept a\r\nsubordinate office. This from a young member not then twenty-three\r\nexcited some amazement, but his assumption soon proved to be well\r\nfounded. On March 11 George sent the chancellor, Thurlow, to negotiate\r\nwith Rockingham, but would not accept his terms. Three days later the\r\ngovernment escaped a vote of want of confidence only by nine votes, and\r\non the 20th North announced the resignation of the ministry. George was\r\nin great distress, and talked of retiring to Hanover, for life would be\r\nunendurable to him if he fell into the hands of the Rockingham party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SECOND ROCKINGHAM MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe two parties in the opposition, though acting together against the\r\ngovernment, held widely different views. The Rockinghams aimed at a\r\nhomogeneous ministry; they represented the aristocratic whig faction,\r\nwere the enemies of prerogative, and were strong advocates of American\r\nindependence. Shelburne, like his old chief, Chatham, was opposed to\r\ngovernment by party, held that the king should have an interest in the\r\ngovernment, and so far \"be his own minister,\" and like Chatham had been\r\nhostile to American independence.[162] For political reasons, then,\r\nGeorge was drawn to Shelburne, while personally he despised Rockingham\r\nand hated Fox. He invited Shelburne first, and then Gower, to form a\r\nministry. Both declined. Shelburne could not afford to split with the\r\nRockinghams; he knew that they could not stand without him, and he\r\nadvised the king to send for Rockingham. George would not see Rockingham\r\nhimself, and negotiated with him through Shelburne on the basis of\r\nfreedom as regards men and measures, and as to the acknowledgment of\r\nAmerican independence.[163] Rockingham formed his cabinet on the 24th.\r\nHe took the treasury. Shelburne was secretary for home, Irish, and\r\ncolonial affairs; Fox for foreign affairs, the third secretaryship being\r\nabolished; Keppel, who was created a viscount, first lord of the\r\nadmiralty; Richmond, master-general of the ordnance; Lord John\r\nCavendish, chancellor of the exchequer; Camden, president of the\r\ncouncil; Grafton, privy seal; Conway, commander-in-chief; Dunning, who\r\nwas created Baron Ashburton, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. To\r\nplease the king Thurlow was retained as chancellor. Pitt was offered,\r\nand declined, a subordinate office. Burke was treated by his\r\naristocratic friends as unworthy of cabinet office, and was made\r\npaymaster of the forces.\r\n\r\nThe king was defeated. His system of personal government through\r\nministers supported by his influence in parliament received its\r\ndeath-blow from the ill-success of the American war. Before long he\r\nadopted a better system; he found a prime minister who could command the\r\nconfidence of the nation, and he yielded himself, not always willingly,\r\nto his guidance. Meanwhile the whigs were victorious. How long they were\r\nto remain victors is yet to be seen. George was resolute, skilful in\r\nintrigue, and by that time well versed in politics. He was aided by the\r\njealousies and mistakes of his opponents. Even in their hour of triumph\r\nthey found that he gained an advantage over them. The cabinet was\r\ndivided; its new members belonged half to the Rockingham and half to the\r\nShelburne party, while Thurlow was the king's trusted friend. Rockingham\r\nacted unwisely in accepting office offered to him in a way which showed\r\nthat he was not to have the king's confidence. Though he was prime\r\nminister, George gave his apparent confidence to another member of the\r\ncabinet. Shelburne was not unreasonably believed to be ready to make\r\nhimself useful to the king with an eye to his own advancement. The seeds\r\nof discord and distrust were at once sown among the new ministers. Even\r\nwhile the ministry was in process of formation Fox sharply remarked to\r\nShelburne that he perceived that it \"was to consist of two parts--one\r\nbelonging to the king, the other to the public\".[164]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145] Coxe, _Bourbon Kings of Spain_, iii., 424-37.\r\n\r\n[146] George III. to North, April 18, 1782, _Corresp._, ii., 423.\r\n\r\n[147] _Rockingham Memoirs_, ii., 425.\r\n\r\n[148] _Parl.

They carried bills\r\npreventing contractors from sitting in parliament and depriving revenue\r\nofficers of the franchise. As these officers, who were dependent on the\r\nministers of the crown, numbered according to one computation nearly\r\n40,000, and to another 60,000, out of an electorate of about 300,000,\r\ntheir disfranchisement was an important step towards freedom of\r\nelection. A message to parliament recommending economy was extorted from\r\nthe king as an introduction to a plan of economical reform which was\r\nbrought forward by Burke. It was not so drastic as his earlier plan, for\r\nthe king acting in the cabinet through Shelburne and Thurlow objected to\r\nmany of the proposed retrenchments. Nevertheless, in spite of\r\nmutilations, the bill, which became law, effected a saving of L72,000 a\r\nyear, chiefly by abolishing useless offices. The act also again provided\r\nfor the payment of arrears of the civil list, amounting this time to\r\nL296,000. Burke nobly continued his work by a bill for the reform of his\r\nown office, preventing the paymaster from gaining the enormous profits\r\nappropriated by nearly all his predecessors. Another declaration in\r\nfavour of freedom of election was made by the commons, for they at last\r\naccepted Wilkes's annual motion for expunging from their journals the\r\nresolution of February, 1769, declaring him incapable of re-election.\r\nThe corrupt influence of the crown would, Pitt declared, be checked most\r\neffectually by a reform of parliament. Acting on his own account, he\r\nproposed an inquiry into the state of the representation, without\r\nbringing forward any scheme of reform. He pointed out that some boroughs\r\nwere in the hands of the treasury, that others had no actual existence,\r\nand that many were merely the property of purchasers, the nawab of\r\nArcot, for example, returning seven or eight members. His motion, though\r\nsupported by Fox, was rejected by 161 to 141.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IRISH INDEPENDENCE._]\r\n\r\nMost memorable of the changes effected during the Rockingham\r\nadministration is the establishment of the legislative independence of\r\nIreland. When Carlisle went over as viceroy in December, 1780, he was\r\ninstructed that the government would not oppose the demand for a _habeas\r\ncorpus_ act, but that he was to prevent parliament from declaring for\r\nlegislative independence, or for a limitation of the perpetual mutiny\r\nact which kept the army beyond its control. The Irish parliament for a\r\nwhile steadily supported the government. The small party in opposition\r\nincluded Flood, who, after holding a lucrative office for six years,\r\nfound himself unable to influence the government, adopted a hostile\r\nline, and was dismissed, and, above all, Grattan who had become leader\r\nof the party after Flood took office. But the force which was to enlist\r\nparliament on the national side was outside its walls. The volunteers\r\ngrew in strength, and reviews of large bodies of them were held during\r\nthe summer of 1781. They remained loyal, and when in September the\r\nfleets of France and Spain threatened the coast of Munster, they eagerly\r\nprepared to meet the enemy. At the same time the impending success of\r\nthe American revolution encouraged them to demand independence for their\r\nown country, and as they were nearly 100,000 armed and disciplined men,\r\nwhile less than 5,000 regular troops were left in Ireland, their voice\r\ncould not be disregarded. It soon made itself heard. On the invitation\r\nof Charlemont's regiment a meeting of delegates from the Ulster\r\nvolunteers assembled in the church of Dungannon on February 15, 1782.\r\nThey passed resolutions condemning the claim of the British parliament\r\nto legislate for Ireland, and the control which, in accordance with\r\nPoyning's act, the privy councils of England and Ireland exercised over\r\nIrish legislation, and they demanded the limitation of the mutiny act,\r\nand the independence of the judges.\r\n\r\nBefore the Irish parliament met after the Easter recess the Rockingham\r\nministry came into office; Carlisle was abruptly removed, and the Duke\r\nof Portland was appointed to succeed him. Rockingham, Fox, and Burke\r\nwere anxious to satisfy Ireland, but the ministry seems not to have\r\ndetermined its exact line of policy. An attempt was made to embarrass\r\nthe ministers by Eden, Carlisle's chief secretary, apparently in revenge\r\nfor their discourteous treatment of Carlisle. Without consultation with\r\nthem, he proposed the repeal of the act of 9 George I. which asserted\r\nthe right of the king and parliament of Great Britain to legislate for\r\nIreland. Fox opposed the motion and it was withdrawn. The next day,\r\nApril 9, the ministers brought a royal message to parliament\r\nrecommending to its consideration means of satisfying Irish discontent.\r\nThe spirit manifested in the Dungannon meeting overcame the resistance\r\nof the Irish parliament, and the nation was united in its demands.\r\nRockingham and Fox tried in vain to persuade Grattan to give them time\r\nfor consideration.[165] On the 16th he moved an address to the king in\r\nthe Irish parliament asserting independence, and it was carried\r\nunanimously. The ministers, misled by Portland, believed that the Irish\r\ndemands might be modified, and proposed negotiation. Grattan refused,\r\nand they yielded everything. On May 17 resolutions, afterwards followed\r\nby statutes, were carried without division in both houses, conceding\r\nlegislative independence to Ireland, restoring the appellate\r\njurisdiction of the Irish house of lords, and limiting the mutiny act.\r\nIreland thus became almost an independent state. It remained connected\r\nwith Great Britain by the tie of the crown, it had no executive\r\ndependent on its parliament, and its legislation was subject to a\r\nministerial veto. The revolution of 1782, pressed on by Grattan, set up\r\nrelations between the two kingdoms which were anomalous and fraught with\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE \"BATTLE OF THE SAINTS\"._]\r\n\r\nNegotiations for peace were in progress, but the war still went on, and\r\nits last great events were glorious. The navy was far stronger than in\r\n1778; the dockyards were busy during the war, and the number of ships\r\nwas much larger. Improvements of various kinds were adopted; ships were\r\ncoppered, the rapidity and accuracy of their fire was increased by new\r\ninventions, and carronades--light guns with a large bore mounted on the\r\nupper deck, for use at close quarters--not yet adopted by the French,\r\nwere added to their armament. The discipline and ardour of the\r\n_personnel_ of the navy reached a high pitch. The British sailor was\r\nkeen to fight the Frenchman, and 93,168 seamen and marines are entered\r\nas borne during the present year. We left the French and Spanish fleets\r\nin the West Indies preparing to conquer Jamaica (p. 227). Grasse was at\r\nFort Royal, and was to join the Spaniards on the coast of San Domingo,\r\nand Rodney, whose fleet was raised by his junction with Hood and the\r\narrival of reinforcements to thirty-seven ships of the line, lay on the\r\nwatch at St. Lucia. On April 8 the French stood out to sea, and the next\r\nday Rodney found them off Dominica. An indecisive action took place in\r\nwhich, owing to baffling calms, only the British van was engaged. Grasse\r\nthen beat to windward between Dominica and the Iles des Saintes, but in\r\nconsequence of various accidents made little way. The British followed\r\nhim, and early on the 12th Sir Charles Douglas, the captain of the\r\nfleet, awakened Rodney with the stirring tidings that \"God had given him\r\nthe enemy on the lee-bow\".\r\n\r\nThe English fleet was numerically the stronger, but the French had finer\r\nships and heavier batteries. The action began about 7.30 A.M. At first\r\nit seemed likely to be as indecisive as usual, the two fleets passing\r\neach other on opposite tacks and cannonading, the French being to\r\nwindward. As they sailed slowly with a light breeze, and at a short\r\ndistance from each other, the British guns and especially the carronades\r\nwere highly effective, for the enemy's ships were crowded with soldiers\r\nfor the attack on Jamaica. Before long the battle took a form which\r\nrendered it memorable in the annals of naval warfare, for Rodney,\r\nwithout previous design, practised the manoeuvre known as breaking the\r\nenemy's line, and by that means was enabled to bring the engagement to a\r\ndecisive issue, such as he hoped for in the battle of April 17, 1780.\r\nThis manoeuvre, afterwards deliberately adopted with triumphant\r\nsuccess by Howe, Nelson, and other great captains, though often\r\npractised in the naval battles between the English and the Dutch in the\r\nseventeenth century,[166] had fallen into complete oblivion, so firmly\r\ndid admirals believe in the necessity of keeping their line of battle.\r\nBy cutting through the enemy's line an admiral could concentrate his\r\nattack on any portion of it which could least easily receive help from\r\nthe rest, and could throw the line into confusion; the ships to the rear\r\nof the point of penetration would be stopped, massed up, and might be\r\ncaught together, while those ahead pursued their course. This mode of\r\nattack was worked out by a landsman, Clerk of Eldin, and though his\r\n_Essay_ was not fully printed until 1782, parts of it were privately\r\ncirculated in 1780.\r\n\r\nAs Rodney's flagship, the _Formidable_ (98), which was half way down the\r\nBritish line, was coming up with the _Glorieux_ (74), the fourth from\r\nGrasse's flagship, the _Ville de Paris_ (104), a slight change in the\r\nwind opened a gap between the _Glorieux_ and the ship next astern of\r\nher. Douglas urged Rodney to steer through the gap. He refused, then\r\nyielded; and as the _Formidable_, firing right and left from every gun\r\nat the ships on either side of her, passed round the stern of the\r\n_Glorieux_, and within pistol-shot of her, the French _canonniers_ could\r\nbe seen throwing down their sponges and handspikes and running below to\r\nescape the storm of shot which she poured upon them. This time Rodney's\r\ncaptains were quick to understand what he was at. The next five ships\r\nfollowed the _Formidable_, and like her engaged on the windward side of\r\nthe enemy. Almost at the same time the ship sixth astern of her also cut\r\nthe enemy's line, passing through a gap abreast of her. The French line\r\nwas thus cut into three divisions, and its central portion, consisting\r\nof five ships, was thrown together and exposed to a deadly attack. By\r\nnoon the enemy was scattered in various groups, the English, who had\r\ngained the wind, attacking at will and without any order. Grasse fought\r\nhis ship, the splendid offering of the city of Paris to its king, with\r\nconspicuous gallantry, and the slaughter on board her was awful. At\r\nlast, about 6 P.M., he hauled down the flag of France with his own\r\nhands, and surrendered himself to Hood on the _Barfleur_ (90). Rodney\r\nthen stopped the fight. Four other prizes were taken. Twenty more, Hood\r\ndeclared, might have been taken if Rodney had followed up his victory.\r\nHe certainly lost a fine opportunity, probably because disease and\r\nsuffering had robbed him of some of his former vigour. As it was, the\r\n\"Battle of the Saints\" saved Jamaica from invasion, seriously damaged\r\nthe French fleet, and shed glory on the navy of Britain.[167]\r\n\r\nThe concluding scenes of the siege of Gibraltar were not less glorious.\r\nVast preparations were made to take the fortress, which in September was\r\nbesieged on the land side by nearly 40,000 men, under the Duke de\r\nCrillon. The combined fleets, forty-nine ships of the line, lay at\r\nAlgeciras, and ten floating batteries were constructed which, it was\r\nbelieved, could neither be sunk nor burned. The garrison consisted of\r\n7,000 men fit for duty. Lord Howe, who on the change of ministry was\r\nappointed to command the channel fleet, sailed to its relief on the 11th\r\nwith thirty-four ships of the line and many store-ships and transports.\r\nOn the 8th, when the enemy's works were not completed, Eliott opened\r\nfire upon them and did them much damage by using red-hot balls. During\r\nthe next four days the enemy replied by a terrific bombardment from\r\ntheir heavy ordnance and gunboats. Early on the 13th a general attack\r\nwas made by land-batteries and sea-batteries, and a perpetual fire was\r\npoured upon the fortress from over 300 pieces of the heaviest artillery.\r\nEliott directed his red-hot shot chiefly against the battering ships,\r\nand at last during the night two of them caught fire. In the confusion\r\nwhich ensued Captain Curtis, commanding a small naval brigade, brought\r\nout his gunboats and completed the enemy's discomfiture. Nine of the\r\nbattering-ships blew up, and the tenth was burnt by Curtis's boats. Some\r\n1,500 of the enemy perished, and 400 were saved from death by the\r\nBritish seamen. After the failure of their great attempt, the enemy\r\ncould only hope to reduce the place by blockade. Howe's fleet had a\r\ntroublesome voyage, and did not come in sight until October 11. He\r\neffected the relief of the garrison with admirable skill. As he repassed\r\nthe straits the combined fleet followed him, and on the 20th engaged him\r\nat a distance, but he brought his fleet off with little damage. The\r\nsiege was raised on February 6, 1783, when the war had ceased. Eliott,\r\nto whom the successful issue of the defence, one of the finest feats of\r\nthe British arms, was principally due, was created Baron Heathfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WAR IN INDIA AND INDIAN WATERS._]\r\n\r\nIn India the outbreak of war with France encouraged the Marathas, who\r\ndominated the country from Mysore to the Ganges, in the hope of\r\nexpelling the British, by acting in conjunction with Haidar Ali.\r\nHastings found that a French agent was intriguing with them, and took\r\nprompt measures against them. An expedition from Bombay failed\r\nmiserably, but Colonel Goddard, who was sent by Hastings from Bengal,\r\ncaptured Ahmadabad, and drove Sindhia over the Narbada. His fortress,\r\nGwalior, was stormed by Major Popham in August, 1780. Nevertheless, the\r\nwar strained Hastings's resources. His difficulties were terribly\r\nincreased by the invasion of the Karnatic. Haidar and his son, Tipu,\r\npractically took the English by surprise, overran the country with an\r\narmy of some 75,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, instructed by 400\r\nFrenchmen; defeated the Madras troops, captured Arcot, and threatened\r\nMadras. Sir Eyre Coote, who had come out to conduct the Maratha war, was\r\ndespatched to Madras, and in 1781 negotiations were opened with Sindhia,\r\nand his former possessions were restored to him. Peace was made with the\r\nMaratha confederacy in May, 1782, by the treaty of Salbai, which was\r\nratified seven months later. While Coote was forcing Haidar to raise the\r\nsiege of various British fortresses in January, 1781, a French fleet\r\nappeared at Pondicherry. Haidar called upon it to help him, for his own\r\nfleet had been destroyed by Admiral Hughes; but Coote prevented the\r\nFrench from obtaining supplies, and they sailed away without effecting\r\nanything. He gained a splendid victory over Haidar at Porto Novo on July\r\n1, met him with doubtful success at Pollilur, completely routed him at\r\nSholinghar, and, in January, 1782, though suffering from serious\r\nillness, skilfully relieved Vellore.\r\n\r\nHughes had already taken the Dutch settlements, Negapatam and\r\nTrincomali, when in February a French fleet appeared off Madras to\r\nprotect them. It was commanded by M. de Suffren, an admiral of\r\nremarkable ability. Suffren sailed from France in March, 1781. He fell\r\non an English squadron, on its way to seize the Dutch colony at the\r\nCape, in the neutral water of Porto Praya harbour in the Cape de Verde\r\nislands. The fight was indecisive, but he arrived first at the Cape and\r\nprevented the projected attack. His fleet was superior to that of\r\nHughes, whose principal object was to prevent him from gaining a port as\r\na place of supply and for landing troops. Hughes fought four indecisive\r\nbattles with him, and was unable either to prevent the French from\r\nacting with Haidar, or from taking Cuddalore, which gave them a good\r\nnaval and military station, or from reducing Trincomali. In this long\r\nand famous naval duel Hughes, though a capable and gallant captain,\r\nshowed himself far inferior to Suffren in strategical and tactical\r\nskill. The French admiral, however, was constantly thwarted by the\r\nmisconduct of his subordinates, while the English captains gave Hughes\r\nloyal support.[168] Coote carried on the war with vigour, but his\r\nvictory over Haidar and his French allies at Arni was rendered fruitless\r\nby his lack of cavalry and supplies. Haidar died in December, leaving a\r\nmessage bidding his son make peace with the English, which Tipu did not\r\nobey. Coote died in April, 1783. The peace with the Marathas enabled the\r\nEnglish to invade Tipu's country on the Malabar side, where they met\r\nwith some success and one signal disaster. Meanwhile Coote's successor,\r\nStuart, was attacking the French in Cuddalore. A fifth indecisive battle\r\nwith Suffren on June 20 compelled Hughes to withdraw his fleet to Madras\r\nto refit. Stuart's army, weakened by disease and in sore need of\r\nsupplies, was saved from probable disaster by the news of the treaty of\r\nVersailles. Deprived of his French allies, Tipu was at last, March 11,\r\n1784, persuaded by Lord Macartney, the governor of Madras, to make\r\npeace. By this treaty, which Macartney made against the commands of\r\nHastings, both parties surrendered their conquests. A renewal of war was\r\ncertain, for Tipu's arrogance was unabated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOX AND SHELBURNE QUARREL._]\r\n\r\nAlthough the government carried some highly beneficial measures it was\r\nnot free from the usual whig failings. Led astray by party spirit, the\r\nministers sent Admiral Pigot, a mere nonentity, to supersede Rodney.\r\nScarcely had they done so when the news of Rodney's victory reached\r\nthem. A messenger was at once despatched to stop Pigot, but it was too\r\nlate. Rodney was created a baron, a rank which some thought unequal to\r\nhis deserts. While the ministers virtuously curtailed the expenditure of\r\nthe civil list, they burdened the country with pensions of L4,000 a year\r\nto Dunning and L3,200 to Barre, both members of Shelburne's party. And\r\nthey quarrelled amongst themselves. That was the inevitable result of\r\nthe existence of two parties in the cabinet. Between Shelburne and Fox\r\nthere was much ill-feeling, which came to a head over the negotiations\r\nfor peace. Until the independence of the American colonies was\r\nacknowledged, negotiations with them belonged to Shelburne's\r\ndepartment. The arrangement of a peace with foreign enemies was Fox's\r\nbusiness, and he would also be responsible for negotiations with the\r\nAmericans as soon as the colonies were recognised as forming an\r\nindependent state. In addition to the difficulties naturally arising\r\nfrom this division of responsibility, the two secretaries differed on\r\npolicy. Fox desired an immediate recognition of American independence,\r\nin the hope of detaching the Americans from the French alliance, and so\r\nputting England in a better position for dealing with her other enemies;\r\nShelburne agreed with the king that the acknowledgment should be a\r\ncondition of a joint treaty with France and America, for England would\r\nthen have a claim to receive some return for it.\r\n\r\nShelburne with, it is said,[169] the consent of the cabinet, sent one\r\nOswald to Paris to open informal negotiations with Franklin. Oswald, who\r\nwas wholly unfit for diplomatic work, favourably received Franklin's\r\nmonstrous proposition that England should cede Canada to the Americans,\r\nthough they had been driven out of the country, and the Canadians\r\nthemselves desired to remain attached to England. He gave Shelburne a\r\npaper containing this proposition. Shelburne, who would certainly not\r\nhave assented to it, treated the paper as confidential and did not show\r\nit to his colleagues. The cabinet agreed that Oswald should return to\r\ntreat with Franklin, and that Thomas Grenville, the second son of George\r\nGrenville, who was nominated by Fox, should negotiate with Vergennes.\r\nRodney's victory gave the ministers ground for believing that, if they\r\ncould separate America from France, they would be in a good position to\r\nresist French demands; and they therefore instructed Grenville to\r\npropose to Vergennes that England should acknowledge American\r\nindependence directly, and not through France. This Fox held gave him\r\nthe whole conduct of the negotiations. As, however, Franklin was anxious\r\nnot to lose so pliant a negotiator as Oswald, the cabinet agreed that\r\nOswald should continue to confer with him. On June 4, Grenville\r\ncomplained to Fox that the separate negotiation between Oswald and\r\nFranklin rendered it impossible for him to make any progress, and\r\nfurther told him that he had learned from Oswald that Shelburne had seen\r\nthe paper containing Franklin's proposition with respect to Canada. Fox\r\nwas indignant, for he considered that Shelburne was carrying on a\r\nclandestine negotiation, and that the concealment of the Canada paper\r\nwas a proof of his duplicity. On the 30th he proposed in the cabinet\r\nthat the independence of America should be acknowledged without a\r\ntreaty, which would have given him the entire charge of the\r\nnegotiations. He was outvoted and declared that he would resign office.\r\nIn this matter Shelburne does not appear to have been guilty of\r\nintrigue. The two secretaries mistrusted and were jealous of one\r\nanother, and Fox was too ready to believe that Shelburne was secretly\r\nworking in league with the king to counteract his negotiations, which\r\nwas not the case. In concealing the Canada paper from his colleagues,\r\nShelburne behaved with characteristic lack of openness, but as\r\nFranklin's proposition was informal and required no answer, the matter\r\nwas trivial, and did not warrant the indignation which was expressed by\r\nFox and his friends.[170]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SHELBURNE MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nOn July 1, the day after Fox declared his intention to resign,\r\nRockingham died. His death delivered George from the domination of the\r\nwhigs. He at once bade Shelburne propose a plan for a ministry. The\r\nRockingham party in the cabinet objected, declaring that they had a\r\nright to advise the king as to his choice, and pressed him to send for\r\nPortland, whose position as a whig magnate constituted his chief claim\r\nto office. George refused to yield to their dictation. Fox would not\r\nserve with Shelburne and resigned the seals. He was followed by only one\r\nmember of the cabinet, Lord John Cavendish, by Portland, Burke,\r\nSheridan, and a few more. Richmond, Keppel, and the rest of the party\r\nremained in office. Shelburne took the treasury, Pitt became chancellor\r\nof the exchequer, and Thomas Townshend succeeded Shelburne, and Lord\r\nGrantham Fox, as secretaries of state. Barre was made paymaster of the\r\nforces, and Lord Temple, afterwards Marquis of Buckingham, the eldest\r\nson of George Grenville, lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Fox was\r\ndisappointed to find that so few followed him. Distrusting Shelburne as\r\nhe did, he could not do otherwise than resign rather than serve with\r\nhim. As, however, the new ministry was a whig ministry, as Shelburne\r\nprofessed many of the Rockingham principles, and as Pitt, who virtually\r\nhad the leadership of the lower house, was at that time a whig, he\r\nshould have taken up a neutral position, supporting the government when\r\nhe approved of its measures and opposing it when he disapproved of them.\r\nHe took another course; at once went into opposition, declared the new\r\nministers could not be bound either by promises or honour, and\r\nprophesied--after events make his words worth remembering--that they\r\nwould soon \"be joined by those men whom the house had precipitated from\r\ntheir seats\".[171] Parliament was prorogued on July 11.\r\n\r\nThe chief business before the new ministry was to arrange terms of\r\npeace. England wished to free the Americans from French influence and to\r\nestablish good relations with them by a separate negotiation. Vergennes\r\nhoped to delay the acknowledgment of independence until a general peace,\r\nintending that France should compensate Spain for her disappointment\r\nwith respect to Gibraltar by securing for her the sole navigation of the\r\nMississippi and that the United States should be enclosed by the\r\nAlleghanies. The American commissioners found that France regarded the\r\nsuccess of the revolution, the result of her own work, with jealousy,\r\nand wished to shut them out from the Newfoundland fishery and from\r\nextension on the west and north. On the other hand, England acknowledged\r\nAmerican independence on September 27, and showed herself inclined to\r\nmeet their demands in a friendly spirit. Accordingly, without consulting\r\nthe French ministers, they signed preliminaries of peace on November 30,\r\nthe treaty to be concluded when terms were arranged between England and\r\nFrance. England acknowledged the sovereignty of the United States; the\r\nMississippi was recognised as their boundary on the west, and on the\r\nnorth a line passing through the great lakes; and they secured a right\r\nto fish on the banks of Newfoundland and in the gulf of St. Lawrence.\r\nThe American revolution was accomplished. Englishmen of all parties\r\nbelieved that the day of England's greatness was over. Yet the\r\nseparation, bitter and humiliating as it was, taught her a lesson in\r\ncolonial government which has rendered her empire strong as well as\r\nvast, while in place of discontented colonies with cramped energies, it\r\nlaid the foundation of a mighty power bound to her by bonds which will\r\ngrow in strength so long as the affairs of both Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States are wisely directed. It was a happy beginning of the\r\nrelations between the two powers that it was through England, and not\r\nthrough their foreign allies, that the Americans obtained the\r\ngratification of their legitimate ambitions, and that from the peace\r\nwith the United States England gained some advantage in treating with\r\nher continental foes.\r\n\r\nThe treaty did not protect the loyalists. Shelburne did his best for\r\nthem, but Franklin was bitter against them, and his feelings were those\r\nof the victorious party generally. The American commissioners would only\r\nagree that there should be no further confiscations and prosecutions,\r\nand that congress should recommend the several states to revise their\r\nlaws concerning them. These articles were nugatory. Nothing short of a\r\nrenewal of the war could have induced the Americans to forego their\r\nrevenge, and if the war had gone on longer, the loyalists' fate would\r\nhave been no better. Everywhere, with the exception of South Carolina,\r\nthey were treated with barbarity. Some 60,000 persons left the country\r\nbefore Carleton evacuated New York, taking refuge either in Great\r\nBritain or her colonies. At least 25,000 of both sexes settled in the\r\nBritish maritime provinces of North America, and helped to establish the\r\nprovince of New Brunswick which received representative institutions in\r\n1784; 10,000 others, United Empire Loyalists as they were afterwards\r\ncalled, in the valley of the St. Lawrence. England did what she could\r\nfor her unfortunate friends; liberal grants of land were made to them,\r\nsome had half-pay as military officers, and between 1783 and 1790\r\nL3,112,455 was distributed among them, besides L25,785 granted in\r\npensions.[172] Relief, however, was slow in coming, and many, reduced\r\nfrom wealth to penury, died in the utmost distress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES._]\r\n\r\nPreliminaries of peace with France and Spain were signed on January 20,\r\n1783, and were followed by the definitive treaty of Versailles concluded\r\non September 3. The war brought France into financial difficulties, and\r\nfor that reason England, though forced to cede some of her conquests in\r\nthe last war, obtained as good terms as she had a right to expect. In\r\nthe West Indies she restored St. Lucia to France, ceded Tobago, and\r\nreceived back Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, Nevis, and\r\nMontserrat. In Africa Senegal and Goree went to France, and Gambia and\r\nFort St. James were guaranteed to England. France received back her\r\ncommercial establishments in India; her right to participate in the\r\nNewfoundland fishery was clearly defined; England ceded to her the\r\nislands of Miquelon and St. Pierre in sovereignty, and the old\r\nstipulation for the demolition of the fortifications of Dunkirk was\r\ngiven up. France and Spain pressed the government to agree to some\r\nexchange for Gibraltar. The king, Shelburne, and the majority of the\r\ncabinet would have let it go if a sufficient compensation had been\r\noffered; Richmond and Keppel objected to its cession on any terms. The\r\nsignature of the American preliminaries strengthened the position of\r\nGreat Britain and the question was dropped.[173] Spain retained Minorca\r\nand West Florida, and England ceded East Florida to her. On the other\r\nhand, Spain restored by treaty Providence and the Bahama isles, which\r\nwere surrendered without bloodshed in 1782, and had already been\r\nrecovered not less easily by England; and she guaranteed the right of\r\nthe English to cut logwood in the bay of Honduras. A truce with Holland\r\nled to a treaty providing for a mutual restoration of conquests, with\r\nthe exception of Negapatam which was retained by England.\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met on December 5, it was evident that the terms of\r\npeace would be sharply criticised by both the parties in opposition, the\r\nfollowers of North and of Fox. Shelburne was disliked and distrusted by\r\nhis colleagues, who considered him secretive and inclined to act alone,\r\nand the government soon showed signs of dissolution. Richmond retired\r\nfrom the cabinet in January, 1783, though he kept his office; the next\r\nday Keppel resigned the admiralty because he was dissatisfied with the\r\npreliminaries, and Carlisle, the lord steward, also resigned for the\r\nsame reason. Shelburne was prevented by his colleagues from making\r\novertures to North, and Pitt, who stood by him, tried to persuade Fox to\r\nre-enter the ministry. Fox asked if Shelburne would remain, and Pitt\r\nhaving answered that he would, at once declined. On this Pitt closed the\r\ninterview with, it is said, the words: \"I did not come here to betray\r\nLord Shelburne\". From that time Pitt and Fox were political enemies. The\r\nDuke of Rutland having succeeded Carlisle as lord steward with a seat in\r\nthe cabinet, Grafton declared that Shelburne had no right to make an\r\naddition to the cabinet without consulting its members, and that he was\r\nmaking himself a \"prime minister,\" and he too resigned the privy seal.\r\nAccording to the whigs the cabinet was to dictate to the king whom he\r\nshould direct to form a cabinet, and was then to control its own\r\ncomposition. Their constitutional ideas were warped by their desire to\r\nperpetuate their own power.\r\n\r\nThe government was not in a case to speak with its enemies in the gate.\r\nIn the commons 140 members were known to be supporters of Shelburne, 120\r\nwere followers of North, and 90 of Fox; the intentions of the rest were\r\nunknown or uncertain. With this division of parties and with the\r\ngovernment in a state of dissolution, Fox, if he had exercised a little\r\npatience, might soon have formed a strong and united whig party. He\r\nchose another course, and, on February 14, formed an alliance with North\r\non the basis of \"mutual good-will and confidence\"; they agreed that\r\nenough had been done to reduce the influence of the crown, that though\r\nthe king should be treated with respect, he should have only \"the\r\nappearance of power,\" and that on the question of parliamentary reform\r\neach should act as he chose. This coalition decided the fate of the\r\ngovernment. The preliminaries of peace were discussed in parliament on\r\nthe 17th, and almost every article was adversely criticised. In the\r\nlords the government address was carried by 13; in the commons it was\r\nrejected by 224 to 208. Fox was reproached for his \"unnatural junction\"\r\nwith North, and his answer showed that he was prepared to act with him\r\nfurther than in that night's debate. On the 21st a vote of censure on\r\nthe terms of the peace was carried by 207 to 190. The coalition was\r\navowed. Fox defended it with ability on the ground that the country\r\nneeded a broad and stable administration, and declared himself a\r\ncandidate for office in the future ministry. Pitt, in a speech of great\r\ndignity, taunted \"the self-made minister,\" contended that the objections\r\nto the peace were simply an attack on Shelburne, and in a fine\r\nperoration spoke of himself as caring more for his own honour than for\r\nthe emoluments of office. Shelburne resigned on the 24th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE COALITION MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe coalition was triumphant. It was condemned by the public, and the\r\nverdict has been endorsed by posterity. Though it is true that North\r\ncarried on the war with America only to please the king, that was not\r\nthen known, and his conduct in that, and almost every important matter,\r\nwas utterly opposed to the principles which Fox professed. What ground\r\nwas there for mutual confidence? For eight years Fox had reviled North\r\nwith extraordinary bitterness. If his words were just he had no business\r\nto ally himself with him. \"My friendships,\" he said, with a Latin\r\nquotation, \"are perpetual, my enmities are not so,\" a good reason for\r\nreconciliation with a private enemy; but political quarrels should be\r\nfounded on differences of principle. Fox's words illustrate his\r\nadherence to the whig notion that the politics of the nation might be\r\ntreated by the members of a few great families as their personal\r\nconcerns. Of the two, North was at first more blamed than Fox, for it\r\nseemed pusillanimous in him to forgive Fox's treatment, but neither\r\nescaped censure. The king was furious. He had no love for Shelburne, but\r\nhe hated Fox, and determined if possible to avoid falling into the hands\r\nof the coalition. He offered the treasury to Pitt, who with admirable\r\ndiscernment saw that his time was not yet come, and refused it. He tried\r\nGower; he tried to detach North from the coalition; he even offered\r\nterms to the coalition; then again he pressed Pitt to take the treasury,\r\nand failing in all these attempts, sought help from Chatham's nephew,\r\nThomas Pitt, and failed to obtain it. From February 24 to April 2 the\r\ncountry was without an organised government. George was almost in\r\ndespair, talked of retiring to Hanover, and spoke bitterly of the\r\ningratitude of North, whose past subservience to him had been largely\r\nrewarded. At last he was forced to accept the coalition ministry, to\r\ngive Portland the treasury, and to submit to the exclusion of Thurlow,\r\nwho had been chancellor since 1778 in the ministries of North,\r\nRockingham, and Shelburne.\r\n\r\nThe new cabinet consisted of Portland, who was little more than a\r\nfigure-head; North and Fox, secretaries of state; Stormont, president of\r\nthe council; Carlisle, privy seal; Lord John Cavendish, chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer; and Keppel, first lord of the admiralty. All except\r\nStormont belonged to the party of Fox, the dominant partner in the\r\ncoalition. The great seal was placed in commission. Burke again became\r\npaymaster, and Sheridan was secretary to the treasury. George was\r\ndetermined not to give his confidence to the ministers who had thus\r\nthrust themselves upon him, and to get rid of them as soon as possible.\r\nFox applied himself assiduously to the duties of office, as indeed he\r\ndid during the Rockingham administration, and strove in vain to overcome\r\nthe king's dislike by deferential behaviour. George's hostility was\r\nstrengthened by the friendship between Fox and the Prince of Wales. The\r\nprince's habits were dissolute and extravagant; he was an undutiful son,\r\nand the king a somewhat unforgiving father. He violently espoused the\r\ncause of the coalition, and George is said to have called the government\r\n\"my son's ministry\". It was time to provide him with a separate\r\nestablishment, and Fox promised him that he would ask parliament for\r\nL100,000 a year. The majority of the cabinet thought the sum too large.\r\nThe king was of the same opinion, and did not wish his son to be\r\nindependent of all parental control. He therefore offered him an\r\nallowance of L50,000 from the civil list. Fox was unwilling to\r\ndisappoint the prince, and the dismissal of the ministers seemed\r\ncertain. They were saved by the prince's acceptance of the king's offer,\r\nin addition to the revenues of the duchy of Cornwall which amounted to\r\nL12,000 a year; and parliament had only to vote him L60,000 for his\r\ndebts and present expenses. The question of parliamentary reform was\r\nagain brought forward by Pitt. As before, he urged that reform would\r\nprevent the crown from again exercising corrupt influence in parliament.\r\nHe proposed as resolutions that the number of county and metropolitan\r\nmembers should be increased, suggesting an increase of at least a\r\nhundred, and that for the future any borough which was found by a\r\ncommittee of the house to be grossly corrupt should be disfranchised.\r\nThis, he believed, would gradually reduce the number of members to what\r\nit then was, and would purify elections. North opposed the motion, Fox\r\nspoke in favour of it, though he wished that it had gone further. It was\r\nlost by 293 to 149. The public was no longer so eager for reform as in\r\n1780.[174] Sawbridge's annual motion for shortening the duration of\r\nparliament was lost by 121 to 56.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WARREN HASTINGS IN INDIA._]\r\n\r\nIndian affairs demanded immediate legislation. The company's charter was\r\nrenewed in 1781; a new arrangement was made as to its dividends and its\r\npayments to the state, and its political transactions were placed more\r\ncompletely under ministerial control. Two committees were also appointed\r\nby the house of commons to inquire into its administration. Of one of\r\nthese Burke was the most active member, and Dundas, then holding office\r\nunder North, was chairman of the other. In 1782 Dundas moved resolutions\r\ncondemning the company's administration; the Rockingham ministry took\r\nthe matter up, and the house voted that Warren Hastings, the\r\ngovernor-general, should be recalled. The directors agreed, but on\r\nRockingham's death the proprietors refused their assent. North's\r\nregulating act of 1773 worked badly. From 1774 to 1780 Hastings was\r\nthwarted in council by three of the four councillors sent out by the\r\nministers, and specially by Francis, the reputed author of the Junius\r\nletters, who opposed him with extreme rancour. Hastings fought a duel\r\nwith him in 1779 and wounded him; he returned to England, and Hastings\r\ngained a majority in the council. The Madras council also quarrelled\r\nwith their governor, Lord Pigot; he was arrested by their order and died\r\nin confinement. Other difficulties arose from the independent action of\r\nthe minor governments of Bombay and Madras, and from the indefinite\r\ncharacter of the powers of the supreme court of judicature.\r\nAdministrative abuses existed, and the extreme financial difficulties\r\ncaused by the wars with the Marathas, Haidar Ali, and the French, drove\r\nHastings to adopt some high-handed measures. The Rockingham whigs were\r\nadverse to him, and Burke, whose generous emotions were roused by any\r\ntale of oppression, applied himself to collecting evidence against him,\r\nwhich his fervid imagination magnified and distorted.\r\n\r\nHastings guided the affairs of India through a period of extreme danger;\r\npreserved the empire, brought order out of anarchy in every branch of\r\nthe administration, and won the esteem and confidence of the subject\r\npeople, the army, and the civil service. His task was not merely to\r\ngovern well, but to provide dividends out of revenue, and his work was\r\ncriticised by the company with reference to its pecuniary results as\r\nwell as its political wisdom. In Bengal he abolished Clive's mischievous\r\ndual system, and administered the province through English officials; he\r\nreformed the collection of the revenue, and he effected large economies\r\nby reducing the enormous pension of the nawab, who under his new system\r\nwas spared the expenses of government, and by withholding the tribute to\r\nthe emperor, who was a mere puppet in the hands of the Marathas. While\r\ngovernor of Bengal he allied himself with the Muhammadan states on the\r\nfrontier, and specially with Oudh, which he wished to make a barrier\r\nagainst Maratha invasion. He took Allahabad and Kora from the emperor,\r\nor rather from the Marathas, and made them over to Shuja-ud-Daula, the\r\nwazir of Oudh, and partly to raise money for the company, and partly as\r\na matter of policy he accepted the wazir's offer of forty lakhs of\r\nrupees for the loan of British troops to help him conquer the Rohillas,\r\nan Afghan tribe which had lately settled in those districts and was\r\nintriguing with the Marathas. The conquest was carried out in Eastern\r\nfashion in 1774, and the wazir's cruelties, which were grossly\r\nexaggerated, were laid to Hastings's charge. The overthrow of the\r\nRohillas was advantageous to the British rule; but though the council at\r\nCalcutta thought the bargain highly profitable to the company, the\r\nhiring out of British troops to serve as subsidiaries to an Asiatic\r\npotentate was a deplorable mistake. Another charge brought against\r\nHastings concerned the execution of Nanda-Kumar (Nuncomar), a rascally\r\nBrahman, who, after Hastings was appointed governor-general, helped his\r\nopponents in the council by bringing charges against him. Nanda-Kumar\r\nwas hanged for a private forgery, after a patient trial in the supreme\r\ncourt. His death was highly convenient to Hastings, but there is no\r\nevidence that he had anything to do with the prosecution or\r\nsentence.[175]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOX'S INDIA BILLS._]\r\n\r\nDuring the Maratha war, a tributary chief, Chait Singh, raja of Benares,\r\nneglected to perform the demands made upon him, and showed a dangerously\r\nindependent spirit. In 1781 Hastings imposed an enormous fine upon him;\r\nhe revolted and was defeated, and his estates were confiscated and given\r\nto a kinsman. Though the raja's conduct was contumacious, Hastings seems\r\nto have acted with undue severity. He was pressed for money, and left\r\nthe raja no choice between paying a very large sum and losing his\r\nestates. Difficulties increased, and he called on Asaf-ud-Daula, then\r\nnawab wazir of Oudh, to pay his heavy arrears of debt to the company.\r\nThe begams, the mother and widow of the late nawab, had a vast treasure\r\nwhich should have belonged to the state. Hastings was informed that\r\nthese powerful ladies were helping Chait Singh; it was necessary to get\r\nmoney from the wazir, and he bade him force the ladies to give up their\r\ntreasure. The resident at Lucknow brought up some troops; the begams'\r\npalace at Faizabad was blockaded, and their eunuch-ministers imprisoned\r\nand maltreated until the resident obtained enough to liquidate the\r\nwazir's debt. The wazir threw the odium of this transaction on the\r\nEnglish. Hastings defended his conduct as just and politic. He was not\r\ndirectly responsible for the severe measures adopted by the wazir, but\r\nit was certainly not a matter in which the British governor-general and\r\nhis officers should have taken any part. His conduct in this matter as\r\nwell as towards the Benares raja was misrepresented and used against him\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the proprietors to recall Hastings was highly displeasing\r\nto the commons, and a petition from the company for relief from some\r\nobligations imposed in 1781 gave occasion to parliament again to\r\ninterfere in its affairs. In April, 1783, Dundas, who was then in\r\nopposition to the coalition ministry, proposed a bill for the government\r\nof India. His plan was to render the governor-general more independent\r\nof his council, to subordinate more completely the inferior governments\r\nto the government of Bengal, to change the uncertain tenure of the\r\nzamindars into hereditary possession, to recall Hastings, and to appoint\r\nsome noble, like Cornwallis, as his successor. As the government\r\npromised to bring in an India bill the next session, he allowed his bill\r\nto drop. When parliament reassembled in November, Fox brought in two\r\nbills, which were largely prepared by Burke, one affecting the\r\nconstitution of the company, the other its administration in India. The\r\nfirst vested the management of the territories, revenue, and commerce\r\nof the company in seven commissioners, named in the bill, for four\r\nyears, with power to appoint and remove all officers of the company.\r\nAfter that term Fox suggested that the crown should nominate the\r\ncommissioners, and meanwhile was to appoint to vacancies. Commercial\r\ntransactions were to be managed by a subordinate board chosen by\r\nparliament from among the larger proprietors. The second bill abolished\r\nall monopolies in India, prohibited the acceptance of presents, and gave\r\nnative landlords an hereditary estate. The objections urged against the\r\nfirst bill by the opposition, and chiefly by Pitt, Grenville, and\r\nDundas, were grounded on its violation of the company's charter, and its\r\ntendency to vest the patronage of India in the existing ministry. Fox\r\nably defended the bill, and Burke, in an eloquent speech, depicted, with\r\nmuch exaggeration, the injustice which, he maintained, the millions of\r\nIndia had suffered during Hastings's administration, and argued that the\r\ndelinquencies of the company justified the violation of its charter.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the political side of the bill which chiefly roused\r\nopposition. All seven commissioners belonged to Fox's party. For four\r\nyears it vested in his nominees \"all the patronage of the East\". Pitt\r\ndeclared that it created \"a new and enormous influence\"; Grenville that\r\n\"the treasures of India like a flood would sweep away our liberties\".\r\nFox was accused of making himself \"King of Bengal,\" and a caricature\r\nrepresents him as Carlo Khan entering Leadenhall street on an elephant\r\nwhich has the face of North and is led by Burke. All this was party\r\nexaggeration; the bill was a genuine attempt to benefit the natives of\r\nIndia, and would not probably have had any really serious consequences\r\nin England, though the control of the Indian patronage for four years\r\nwould have strengthened Fox's party, and, if it had afterwards been\r\nvested in the crown, would have given some opportunity for the exercise\r\nof corrupt influence by ministers. The king was waiting for an\r\nopportunity to get rid of the coalition ministry, and Thurlow and Temple\r\neasily excited his jealousy for the prerogative by telling him that the\r\nbill would deprive him of half his power and disable him for the rest of\r\nhis life. His influence in the commons was diminished by recent\r\nlegislation, and there the bill was carried by two to one. Before the\r\nsecond reading in the lords he gave Temple a card authorising him to\r\nsay that, whoever voted for the bill \"would be considered by him as an\r\nenemy\". This soon became known, and, on December 17, the commons voted\r\nby 153 to 80 that it was now necessary to declare that to report the\r\nking's opinion on any question pending in parliament with a view to\r\ninfluence votes is a high crime and misdemeanour. Nevertheless the\r\nking's unconstitutional move was successful; the lords rejected the\r\nbill. The next night George ordered the secretaries of state to send\r\nback their seals, for he would not receive them personally, and the\r\ncoalition ministry was dismissed. Pitt at once accepted the offices of\r\nfirst lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT FORMS A MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nHe was then in his twenty-fifth year. Extraordinary difficulties faced\r\nhim: the opposition of a large majority of the commons, led by Fox, a\r\nmaster of debate, and strong in men of ability and experience, and the\r\ndiscredit attaching to the king's unconstitutional action to which he\r\nowed his position. He found it difficult to form a ministry, for few\r\nwere willing to join him in a struggle in which victory seemed hopeless.\r\nShelburne, his former leader, he would not invite, for he could not\r\nendure his habitually enigmatic conduct. Temple, an instigator and the\r\nagent of the king's action, became secretary of state, but immediately\r\nresigned owing apparently to a personal offence. The new cabinet\r\nconsisted only of Lords Sydney (Thomas Townshend) and Carmarthen,\r\nsecretaries for the home and foreign departments; Gower, president of\r\nthe council; Rutland, privy seal; Thurlow, chancellor; and Howe, first\r\nlord of the admiralty; besides Pitt who alone among them sat in the\r\ncommons. Richmond again became master of the ordnance and a little later\r\nre-entered the cabinet. Dundas was treasurer of the navy. Pitt's\r\nacceptance of office was regarded by the opposition as a \"boyish freak\";\r\nhis ministry was \"a mince-pie administration which would end with the\r\nChristmas holidays\".[176]\r\n\r\nPitt had a majority of the commons against him; but in those days the\r\ncabinet was not so wholly dependent on the commons as it became after\r\n1832.[177] Supported by the king and the lords, Pitt determined to do\r\nbattle with the majority in the hope that he would overcome their\r\nopposition, discredit his enemies, and win the confidence of the country\r\nbefore he appealed to it. Fox should have urged an immediate\r\ndissolution. If Pitt had tried to avoid it, he would have incurred the\r\nodium of hesitating to accept the will of the nation. Fox, however, used\r\nevery effort to prevent a dissolution. The will of the commons had been\r\nthwarted by the king's unconstitutional interference, and he was\r\ndetermined to vindicate the authority of the house. Besides, he had a\r\nsubstantial majority, and though it might have been maintained by a\r\ngeneral election, he knew that his coalition with North was unpopular,\r\nand that his India bill had aroused the hostility of some powerful\r\ncorporations which felt that their privileges were endangered by his\r\nattack upon the company's charter. The affairs of India were at once\r\nmade a pretext for an address to the crown deprecating a dissolution;\r\nthe house was engaged upon them, and a dissolution would frustrate its\r\nendeavours. The king replied that he would not interfere with its work\r\neither by dissolution or prorogation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S VICTORIOUS CONTEST._]\r\n\r\nThe house reassembled after the Christmas recess on January 12. Fox\r\nrelying on the authority of Lord Somers, one of the leading statesmen of\r\nthe revolution, questioned the right of the crown to dissolve parliament\r\nduring the business of a session; James II., he said, had done so and\r\nput an end to his reign. His contention was unsound; the will of a house\r\nof commons is not conclusive: the crown has a right to dissolve in order\r\nto ascertain the will of the nation. Pitt replied that he \"would not\r\ncompromise the royal prerogative or bargain it away in the house of\r\ncommons\". He was in a minority of 193 to 232. On the 14th, he brought in\r\nhis India bill, which proposed to place the political concerns of the\r\ncompany under a board of control in England to be appointed by the\r\ncrown, and to leave to the company its commerce and patronage. Fox\r\nattacked it as incomplete, and it was negatived though only by eight\r\nvotes. A fierce struggle followed, a struggle, Dr. Johnson called it,\r\n\"between George the Third's sceptre and Mr. Fox's tongue\". Fox tried\r\nevery means to force the ministers to resign; he put forth all his\r\nwonderful powers of debate and attacked Pitt with great bitterness;\r\naddresses to the crown and resolutions hostile to the ministers were\r\nadopted, and the supplies and the mutiny act were postponed. Through it\r\nall Pitt exhibited wonderful courage, sagacity, and self-control. A body\r\nof independent members proposed a compromise, and the king reluctantly\r\nassented. Fox declared himself willing to work with Pitt, but,\r\ndetermined to assert the authority of the house, insisted that the\r\nministers should resign before arrangements were discussed. To this Pitt\r\nhaughtily refused to assent. George upheld him: during the late\r\nadministration he would not create any peers; on Pitt's recommendation\r\nhe created four, and almost daily sent his young minister encouraging\r\nlittle notes. The lords too were on his side; they condemned as\r\nunconstitutional a resolution of the commons suspending certain\r\nstatutory powers of the treasury, which was adopted in order to\r\nembarrass the ministry, and sent an address to the king assuring him of\r\ntheir support in the just exercise of the prerogative.\r\n\r\nPitt won general admiration by granting the valuable sinecure office of\r\nclerk of the pells to Barre in exchange for the pension secured to him\r\nby the whigs. His private means were only L300 a year, and, as such\r\nmatters were then regarded, he might have taken the office himself\r\nwithout scandal; but uncertain as his position seemed to be, he\r\npreferred saving the country L3,200 a year to putting it into his own\r\npocket. Feeling outside the house ran strongly in his favour; addresses\r\nwere sent up thanking the king for dismissing the late ministry, and\r\nPitt was presented with the freedom of the city of London. As on his\r\nreturn from the city on February 27 his carriage was being drawn by\r\nworkmen in triumph up St. James's street, it was attacked opposite\r\nBrooks's, the meeting-place of Fox's party; he was assaulted and escaped\r\nwith difficulty into White's club. Members of Brooks's were believed to\r\nbe concerned in the outrage, which increased Pitt's growing popularity.\r\nThe opposition began to waver. On March 1 a fresh address to the king\r\nfor the removal of the ministers was carried by only twelve votes.\r\nGeorge again refused his assent. Fox shrank from attempting the extreme\r\nmeasure of refusing supplies; it would, indeed, have been useless, for\r\nhis suggestion that the house should pass a mutiny bill for a brief\r\nperiod met with no encouragement. He made one more effort; on the 8th he\r\nmoved a representation to the king, drawn up by Burke, which was carried\r\nonly by one vote. The struggle was over; the next day the usual mutiny\r\nbill passed without a division; the supplies were voted, and on the 23rd\r\nPitt saw that the time had come for a dissolution. A difficulty suddenly\r\narose, for the great seal was stolen from Thurlow's house. A new one was\r\npromptly made, and on the 25th parliament was dissolved.\r\n\r\nOf his coalition with North, Fox said that it could be justified only by\r\nsuccess. For a second time he put his political fate to the touch. He\r\nattempted to give absolute authority to one branch of the legislature,\r\nto enable an existing house of commons to restrain the constitutional\r\nexercise of the prerogative, to prolong its own existence, and to hinder\r\nan appeal to the will of the nation. Both moves were disastrous to him.\r\nThe coalition was condemned as unprincipled; whigs were offended at his\r\nalliance with North, whom they held responsible for the American war,\r\ntories by the alliance of North with the opponent of prerogative. His\r\nattempt to hinder the expression of the national will by a general\r\nelection perplexed the whigs, his attack on the prerogative disgusted\r\nthe tories. His India bill alarmed chartered bodies, and was held,\r\nunjustly it is true, but with some show of reason, to be inspired by the\r\nwish to perpetuate the power of the whig oligarchy through corrupt\r\ninfluence. Feelings of personal loyalty and of admiration for the\r\nyouthful minister who dared to fight, and was able to win, the king's\r\nbattle against such tremendous odds, combined to destroy the effect of\r\nGeorge's unconstitutional proceeding and to rouse enthusiasm for Pitt.\r\nThe opposition candidates were defeated in almost all the larger\r\nconstituencies; 160 of them--\"Fox's martyrs\" they were called--lost\r\ntheir seats. The rout was complete; even Yorkshire, so long faithful to\r\nthe great houses, returned Pitt's friend, Wilberforce, the son of a\r\nbanker. One consolation they had. After an exciting struggle Fox was\r\nre-elected for Westminster, though only as second member, and, as we\r\nshall see, even this triumph was disputed. Fox's conduct caused the\r\noverthrow of the whig party, and gave the government into the hands of a\r\nminister whose high principles, not less than his supreme ability,\r\ncommanded and preserved the confidence of the nation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[165] H.

Though the cursory review of them\r\nattempted in this chapter will extend beyond the date which we have\r\nalready reached, it seems time to say something of such matters, and a\r\nlook ahead will make the later narrative more complete and intelligible.\r\nWith the painful exception of a deterioration in the condition of the\r\npoor, these changes were for the better. Manners became more decent,\r\npity was more easily evoked by human suffering, and culture more widely\r\ndiffused. Moral improvement may be traced to a revival of practical\r\nreligion and to a general reaction from the artificial cast of thought\r\nof earlier days, while as forces on the same side may be reckoned the\r\ninfluence of the king and, in a greater degree, that exercised by a\r\nnumber of distinguished men such as Johnson and Burke. Ideas elaborated\r\nand propounded by French philosophers shook the smug satisfaction of the\r\nworld in what was hard, shallow, and insincere, and combined with the\r\nstress of a great war to complete the slow progress of a change in\r\nEnglish taste. After long hesitation literature and art finally turned\r\nfrom unreality and convention, and drew inspiration direct from nature.\r\nAs regards material progress, manufactures and commerce were enormously\r\nincreased by the use of mechanical inventions, and the productive power\r\nof the soil by improvements in agriculture. The conditions of industry\r\nchanged and, as must ever be the case, industrial revolution brought\r\nsuffering on the poor.\r\n\r\nThe highest class still formed a small and close society; there was no\r\ndoubt as to who belonged to it and no chance for an outsider to push his\r\nway into it. The members of it were so thoroughly acquainted with one\r\nanother's doings that invitations to dinner were often given only two\r\ndays beforehand, and with even shorter notice. They had enormous\r\nauthority, both political and social. Entirely independent of public\r\nopinion, those of them who loved vice or frivolity indulged their tastes\r\nwithout shame or measure. Gambling, the fashionable folly, was carried\r\nto an extraordinary height, especially between 1772 and 1776. At\r\nBrooks's the stakes at quinze were not less than L50, and there was\r\noften L10,000 on the table. Gamesters exchanged their rich clothes for\r\nfrieze coats, covered their lace ruffles with leather cuffs, and\r\nshielded their eyes by high-crowned hats with broad brims. Fox\r\nsquandered L140,000, chiefly at play, by the time he was twenty-five,\r\nand his brother Stephen lost L20,000 at a sitting. Among the older\r\ngamesters were Lord Masham, too poor for such folly, the wicked Lowther,\r\nwitty George Selwyn, and his associate, Lord March, afterwards Duke of\r\nQueensberry, Fox's instructor in vice, the \"old Q.\" who in the next\r\ncentury as he sat in his favourite place above the porch of his house in\r\nPiccadilly presented to the passers-by the embodiment of the iniquities\r\nof an older generation. Ladies were not less given to play than men.\r\nDuchesses at Bath, the \"paradise of doctors and gamesters,\" set an\r\nexample which the vice-regal court at Dublin professed to imitate by\r\nspending whole nights at unlimited half-guinea loo.\r\n\r\nThere was no redeeming side to this gambling; it was a sordid struggle\r\nfor money. At Brooks's in 1781 Fox, in partnership with some allies,\r\nkept the bank at faro as a regular business, one partner relieving\r\nanother, and play going on continuously night and day. As the dealer and\r\nthe partners could be seen at work through the open windows of the club,\r\none can scarcely wonder that Fox's faro-bank was a sore point with the\r\nopposition. He won largely, then lost, and finally was L30,000 \"worse\r\nthan nothing\". Idlers in St. James's street were amused by watching the\r\nJews as they packed his clothes and books and carted them off from his\r\nlodgings. The next year the king was forced to make him a secretary of\r\nstate. Though gambling continued common, it became less extravagant and\r\nwas more widely condemned. In 1796, when the war with France was\r\nsobering people, some ladies of rank created a scandal by keeping a\r\nfaro-bank at their houses. Chief-justice Kenyon threatened the pillory,\r\nand Gillray expressed and stimulated public opinion by a caricature\r\nrepresenting two of \"Faro's daughters\" in that position. One of them,\r\nLady Buckinghamshire, and two of her associates, were fined the next\r\nyear for unlawful gaming. Fox and other gamesters of the wild time\r\nsupplemented the faro-bank by betting at Newmarket. It was a notable\r\nperiod in the history of the turf, for many great men, specially of the\r\nwhig party, were eager and judicious breeders. Such were the king's\r\nuncle, Cumberland, the breeder of Eclipse, Grafton, Rockingham,\r\nEgremont, Richmond, and Sir Charles Bunbury, whose horse Diomed won the\r\nfirst Derby race in 1780. The professional bookmaker was not yet, and\r\nracing, though used for betting purposes, was free from some evils which\r\ngrew up later. The sport was popular, and in 1784 as many as 500 plates\r\nwere raced for annually.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXCESSIVE DRINKING._]\r\n\r\nExcessive drinking was common in society. Since the Methuen treaty of\r\n1703 port was the wine most drunk. A genuine port cost about two\r\nshillings a bottle, but the wine was largely adulterated on importation,\r\nand one stingy lord is said to have recommended his guests to drink his\r\nport instead of a more expensive wine by assuring them that he knew that\r\nit was good as he made it himself.[178] Men would constantly drink two\r\nbottles of port apiece at a sitting, and sometimes three and even more,\r\nand would appear in parliament, in the theatre, or in a drawing-room in\r\na state of drunkenness. A treaty with France in 1786 largely increased\r\nthe consumption of French wines, but this change, which favoured\r\nsobriety, was ended by the war. Nevertheless, drunkenness was less\r\ngeneral than earlier in the century, and, except in the Prince of\r\nWales's set, seems to have decreased during the war with France. Duels\r\nwere frequent, and, though towards the end of our period they were\r\nincreasingly condemned by religious people, they were approved of by\r\nsociety at large. For some time men of fashion dressed in velvets and\r\nsilks of various hues, but during the American war Fox, once the most\r\nextravagant of \"macaronis,\" and his friends showed their political\r\nsympathies by carelessness in dress, and their example was largely\r\nfollowed. Men's dress, however, did not decline until about 1793 when\r\nthe whigs imitated the severity affected by the French republicans. Wigs\r\nwere discarded early in the reign, except by professional men, and\r\nhair-powder began to fall out of fashion by the end of the century.\r\nThen, too, ladies' dress became more simple, chiefly because\r\nimprovements in the textile manufactures provided them with materials at\r\nonce simple and pleasing.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary amusements of society, fashionable people\r\nfrequented public assemblies, of which those at Ranelagh were longest in\r\nvogue. The company at Vauxhall was more mixed. People of the\r\nshop-keeping and lower classes enjoyed themselves in the numerous\r\npleasure resorts about London, such as Mary-le-bone gardens, Islington,\r\nand Sadler's Wells. Theatres were well attended and the increase of\r\npublic decency is illustrated by the disappearance from the stage of the\r\ncoarseness of earlier times. It was the golden age of the drama; for it\r\nsaw the acting of Macklin and Garrick, of Mrs. Siddons, \"the tragic\r\nmuse,\" and her brother John Kemble, of Mrs. Abington, Miss Farren, \"the\r\ncomic muse,\" afterwards Countess of Derby, and Mrs. Jordan. As\r\ndramatists Home, Foote, Colman, and Cumberland deserve to be mentioned;\r\nand Goldsmith and Sheridan wrote comedies which, while belonging to\r\nacting drama, adorn English literature. Among less respectable\r\namusements bull-baiting was confined to the lowest class. An attempt to\r\nrender it illegal was defeated in parliament in 1800, chiefly through\r\nthe opposition of Windham. Cock-fighting, though widely condemned, was\r\npractised even by gentlemen, chiefly as a means of betting. Exhibitions\r\nof combats with swords became extinct, and made way for the scarcely\r\nless dangerous prize-fights of bruisers which from about 1788 became\r\nextremely popular.\r\n\r\nForeign travel, which earlier was almost confined to the \"grand tour\"\r\nmade by rich young men as part of their education, increased greatly\r\nbefore the revolutionary war, and travelling in England became more\r\ngeneral as the means of communication were improved. In 1760 English\r\nroads were little better than they were a century before, mere\r\ntrackways, which in parts were sloughs in winter and scored with deep\r\nruts in summer. Travelling over them was slow and often dangerous. The\r\n\"flying-machine,\" or coach, between London and Sheffield was fully three\r\ndays on its journey. During the first fourteen years of the reign 452\r\nacts were passed for repairing roads, but for some time little progress\r\nwas made. Many and bitter are the complaints made by Arthur Young, the\r\neminent agriculturist, of the roads on which he travelled in 1769-70.\r\nOne turnpike road was a bog with a few flints scattered on top, another\r\nfull of holes and deep ruts, while \"of all the cursed roads which ever\r\ndisgraced this kingdom\" that between Tilbury and Billericay was, he\r\nsays, the worst, and so narrow that when he met a waggon, the waggoner\r\nhad to crawl between the wheels to come to help him lift his chaise over\r\na hedge. During the last quarter of the century a vast change was\r\neffected; good roads became general, and coaches with springs and\r\notherwise well appointed ran between London and most considerable towns,\r\nand between one large town and another. From 1784 many of these coaches\r\ncarried the mails, and letters posted in Bath were delivered in London\r\nseventeen hours later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _POETRY._]\r\n\r\nThe wider outlook acquired by travel contributed to an increase of\r\nintellectual activity, and improved means of internal communication\r\nassisted the dissemination of books. People read more; many instructive\r\nbooks met with a large sale, and circulating libraries were established\r\nin the larger towns. In literature the period is marked by an advance in\r\nthe transition from artificiality of thought, and still more of\r\nexpression, to what was natural and spontaneous. Antiquity began to\r\nattract, and romanticism gradually gained ground. Thomson, who led the\r\nflight of poetry from the gilded house of bondage, wrote at an earlier\r\ntime than ours. For us the new feeling is illustrated by the popularity\r\nof _Ossian_, Bishop Percy's _Reliques_, Gray's romantic lyrics, and the\r\npseudo-antique poems of Chatterton, a Bristol lad who killed himself in\r\n1770. Goldsmith's poetry belongs to the old school, for he was a\r\nfollower of Johnson, a strenuous opponent of the new romanticism. The\r\npoetry of Cowper, an ardent lover of nature, whose first volume appeared\r\nin 1781, though usually conventional in expression, is always sincere\r\nand sometimes exquisite. Crabbe, a story-teller and preacher, wrote some\r\ntrue poetry, along with much that is prosaic: rarely moved by an\r\ninspiration drawn from nature to desert the conventional couplet, he\r\nnevertheless had something of the spirit of the new movement. In 1783\r\nthe artist-poet Blake began to write verse which is absolutely\r\nuntrammelled by convention, mystical, strange, and unequal. Three years\r\nlater a volume by Robert Burns, the national poet of Scotland, contained\r\nthe outpouring of a passionate soul in musical verse, and in 1798, two\r\nyears after his death, the victory of the romantic school was secured by\r\nthe publication of the _Lyrical Ballads_ of Wordsworth and Coleridge,\r\nthough its triumph was not confirmed until a few years later.\r\n\r\nBy 1760 Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett had established the English\r\nnovel, though Smollett's master-piece, _Humphrey Clinker_, did not\r\nappear until 1771, the year of his death. Fiction developed in various\r\ndirections. In _The Vicar of Wakefield_ Goldsmith, in spite of his\r\nliterary conservatism, portrayed manners and character with a perfectly\r\nnatural grace, and with a delightful delicacy of touch. Laurence Sterne,\r\nthe humorous and indecent prebendary of York, illustrates the prevalence\r\nof sensibility in contemporary society in his _Tristram Shandy_ and the\r\n_Sentimental Journey_. It is a curious characteristic of the time that\r\ndisplays of emotion by men and women alike were reckoned as proofs of\r\ngenuine fineness of feeling. Sterne's sentiment and discursiveness found\r\nseveral feeble imitators. The taste for antiquity was strong in Horace\r\nWalpole, and his admiration for \"the gothick,\" expressed in the pointed\r\nwindows and sham battlements of his house at Strawberry hill, inspired\r\nhis romance, _The Castle of Otranto_ (1764), which began the romantic\r\nmovement in fiction. To this movement, destined to be adorned by the\r\ngenius of Scott, belong Beckford's _Vathek_, Clara Reeve's _Old English\r\nBaron_, and the once widely popular tales of mystery of Mrs. Radcliffe\r\nand \"Monk\" Lewis, as he was called after his best-known romance (1795).\r\nThe novel of manners was developed by Fanny Burney's (Madame d'Arblay)\r\n_Evelina_ (1778), founded on acute observation, dealing almost wholly\r\nwith every-day life, replete with satire, and written with extraordinary\r\nfreshness and vivacity. _Castle Rackrent_, the first of Maria\r\nEdgeworth's Irish tales, appeared in the last year of the century.\r\nBefore its close, too, Jane Austen was writing novels which as yet could\r\nfind no publisher, though in their faultless execution, their delicate\r\nhumour, and their life-like representation of the society with which\r\ntheir author was familiar they remain unrivalled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SERIOUS PROSE WORKS._]\r\n\r\nOf the writers of serious prose works, Johnson, as critic, moralist and\r\nauthor, enjoyed until his death in 1784 a kind of literary dictatorship.\r\nHis greatest achievement, _The Lives of the English Poets_, belongs to\r\nhis later days. This delightful work pronounces with unfaltering\r\ndogmatism judgments founded on canons of criticism which were accepted\r\nin the then expiring age of Augustan literature. His _Life_ by his\r\nsatellite Boswell holds the first place among biographies as a triumph\r\nof portraiture. The new interest in antiquity was fostered by the rise\r\nof English historical writing. In the earliest years of the reign Hume\r\ncompleted his _History of England_, which, though no longer regarded as\r\nof scientific importance, is a fine example of literary treatment as\r\napplied to history. A little later came Robertson's works, more\r\nscholarly in their design, and written in a philosophic spirit and in\r\nhighly polished language. The work of one historian of the time is great\r\nalike as a monument of learning and of literary faculty. The first\r\ninstalment of Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ appeared\r\nin 1766, the last in 1788. The grandeur of its conception, the orderly\r\nmethod of its construction, the learning it displays, and the unflagging\r\npomp with which the historian presents his narrative, invest this book\r\nwith a pre-eminence in English historical literature which remains\r\nbeyond dispute. Other famous books of the time are Paley's theological\r\nworks, Sir William Blackstone's _Commentaries on the Laws of England_,\r\nand Adam Smith's _Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_ (1776).\r\nSmith, while laying the foundations of political economy as a distinct\r\nscience, treated theories in relation to actual facts; his book was at\r\nonce accepted as a guide by statesmen, and largely inspired Pitt's\r\neconomic policy. As a political writer Burke carried rhetoric to the\r\nsublimest heights in his _Reflections on the French Revolution_ and some\r\nlater works. Lord Chesterfield's _Letters_, many of them belonging to\r\nthe early years of the reign, are admirable for their wit and elegance,\r\nbut lack the special quality of the inimitable _Letters_ of Horace\r\nWalpole, written on a countless number of topics, and treating them in a\r\nmanner which, though somewhat affected, is easy and singularly\r\nappropriate to the writer's cast of mind. Of the Junius _Letters_\r\nenough has been said; they are political articles, not parts of a\r\ncorrespondence. Lastly, it would be unbecoming to omit here a notice,\r\nhowever cursory, of Walpole's valuable though not always trustworthy\r\nhistorical _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical architecture of the time was deplorable. Towards the\r\nend of the century it was affected by the revolt from classicism in\r\nliterature; and a desire was manifested to desert the corrupt following\r\nof classical models for Gothic art, but it was unaccompanied by taste or\r\nknowledge, and the elder Wyatt's sins of destruction at Salisbury and\r\nelsewhere have made his name a by-word. In secular architecture things\r\nwere better; Chambers, the architect of Somerset House, Robert Adam and\r\nhis brothers, architects of the Adelphi buildings, and the younger Wood\r\nat Bath have left us works of considerable merit. In art, however, our\r\nperiod is chiefly memorable as that of the development of the English\r\nschool of painting. Sir Joshua Reynolds, one of the great portrait\r\npainters of the world, was in high repute in 1760, was the first\r\npresident of the Royal Academy, founded in 1768, and independently of\r\nhis work did much to raise the appreciation of art, for he was\r\nuniversally respected. He started the famous literary club of which his\r\nfriends, Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, and other distinguished men, were\r\nmembers. Scarcely inferior to Reynolds as a portrait-painter,\r\nGainsborough invested his subjects with wonderful grace, and Romney,\r\nthough not attaining to the height of these two, may be reckoned with\r\nthem as a master of his art. Before the end of our period Hoppner and\r\nLawrence were working in London and Raeburn in Edinburgh. The heavy debt\r\nwhich English landscape painting owes to Wilson, who lived neglected,\r\nhas been acknowledged since his death. In that line Gainsborough was\r\nunsurpassed; he was wholly free from classical tradition and, as in his\r\nportrait work, interpreted nature as it presented itself to his own\r\nartistic sense. By 1800 Girtin had laid the foundation of genuine\r\npainting in water-colours, and Turner was entering on his earlier style,\r\nworking under the influence of old masters. Humble life and animals were\r\ndepicted by Morland, who was true to nature and a fine colourist. In the\r\ntreatment of historical subjects classical tradition long held an\r\nundisputed sway; and the chief claim of West, once a fashionable artist,\r\non our remembrance is that he broke away from it in his best picture,\r\n\"The Death of Wolfe,\" painted in 1771, which represents his figures in\r\nthe uniforms they wore instead of dressed as Romans, a revolt which\r\ncaused no small stir.\r\n\r\nEngraving on copper flourished, aided by the enterprise of Boydell, and\r\nwood-engraving was brought to perfection by the brothers Bewick. In\r\nsculpture, Flaxman, Nollekens, and Bacon did first-rate work. Music\r\nalone of the arts really interested the king. The public taste was\r\nstimulated by the establishment of Handel commemoration concerts; the\r\nopera was well attended, and church music was enriched by some\r\ndistinguished composers. People of the upper and middle classes cared\r\nfar more for art of all kinds than in the earlier half of the century:\r\nthe rich bought the works of old Italian and French masters; exhibitions\r\nof art were thronged, and articles of _virtu_ found a ready sale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY._]\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years of the reign much interest in natural science\r\nwas aroused, probably through French influence. England soon came to the\r\nfront in scientific investigation. Among the principal contributors to\r\nthis movement were Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen, and Black, of\r\nlatent heat; Cavendish, the investigator of air and water; Sir William\r\nHerschel, the astronomer, who spent most of his life in England; Hutton,\r\nthe father of British geological science; Sir Joseph Banks, the\r\nnaturalist; Hunter, the \"founder of scientific surgery\"; and Jenner, who\r\nin 1798 announced the protective power of vaccination against small-pox.\r\nScience was aided by voyages of discovery, some of them of the highest\r\nfuture importance in the history of the world, and in the extension of\r\nthe British empire. Between 1764 and 1768 come Commodore Byron's\r\nfruitless voyage round the world, and the discovery of a large number of\r\nislands in the South Pacific by Captains Wallis and Carteret. Cook's\r\nthree great voyages were made between 1768 and 1779. In the course of\r\nthem he sailed round New Zealand, explored the east coast of Australia\r\nand the new Hebrides, discovered New Caledonia and the Sandwich islands,\r\nand attempted to find a passage from the North Pacific round the north\r\nof the American continent. In 1780 an expedition under Captain Bligh,\r\nsent to transport bread-fruit trees from Otaheite to the West Indies for\r\nacclimatisation, ended in the famous mutiny on board his ship, the\r\n_Bounty_. To the last years of the century belong the voyages of Bass\r\nand Flinders in Australian waters. Meanwhile Mackenzie descended the\r\nriver which bears his name to the Arctic ocean, and in 1770 Bruce, the\r\nAbyssinian traveller, reached the sources of the Blue Nile.\r\n\r\nBetween 1760 and 1801 the national Church, the proper instrument of\r\nnational reformation, was passing through a period of transition. Its\r\nvitality was somewhat injured by its controversy with the deists, and\r\nstill more by the action of the state. It was a powerful political\r\nengine and as such it was used by statesmen. Convocations remained\r\nsilenced, and Church preferments were made to serve political ends and\r\nwere regarded both by clergy and laity as little more than desirable\r\noffices. Clergymen begged bishoprics and deaneries of Newcastle with\r\nunblushing importunity, sometimes even before the men they aspired to\r\nsucceed had breathed their last. Neither they, nor the ministers who\r\ntreated Church patronage as a means of strengthening their party, were\r\nnecessarily careless about religion. Newcastle and Hardwicke, for\r\nexample, were religious men, and the personal piety of some\r\npreferment-seeking bishops is unquestioned. It was a matter in which the\r\nChurch was neither better nor worse than the age. The ecclesiastical\r\nsystem was disorganised by plurality and non-residence; the dignified\r\nclergy as a whole were worldly minded, and the greater number of the\r\nrest were wretchedly poor. The Church was roused to a sense of its duty\r\nto society by methodism and evangelicalism, two movements for a time\r\nclosely connected, though after 1784 methodism became a force outside\r\nthe church. By 1760 the persecution to which John Wesley and his\r\nfellow-workers had sometimes been exposed was over, and methodism was\r\ngaining ground. It very slightly touched aristocratic society, chiefly\r\nthrough the efforts of the Countess of Huntingdon, who, in spite of her\r\nquarrel with Wesley's party, must be regarded as one of the leaders of\r\nthe movement; its influence on the labouring class, specially in large\r\ntowns and in the mining districts, was strong, and it gained a\r\nconsiderable hold on people of the middle class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE EVANGELICALS._]\r\n\r\nWithin the Church rapid progress was made by the evangelical movement.\r\nMany of the earlier evangelical clergy were methodists, some workers\r\nwith Wesley, others preachers of Lady Huntingdon's \"connexion\" before\r\nher secession in 1781. During the last two decades of the century the\r\nevangelicals became distinct from the methodists and formed an\r\nincreasing body inside the Church. Among its clerical chiefs were\r\nRomaine, Venn, Cecil, and Newton of Olney, the spiritual guide of many\r\nof its leading adherents; it owed much to Lord Dartmouth's patronage,\r\nCowper's poetry presented its doctrine in a pleasing form, Hannah More\r\nfurthered its cause by her writings, and Wilberforce brought it into\r\nconnexion with political life. Only one of the avowed evangelical\r\nclergy, Isaac Milner, Dean of Carlisle, received dignified preferment\r\nbefore 1800, for the king was averse from \"enthusiasm,\" and though\r\nPitt's Church appointments were eminently respectable, he does not seem\r\nto have been guided in making them by any exalted consideration.\r\nWhatever the failings of the evangelical party may have been, it\r\ncertainly exercised a strong and wholesome influence on the national\r\nlife, which was aided by the effects of the war with France. Not only\r\ndid the discipline of war sober the nation, but it also extended the\r\nrevolt against unreality which took place in the domains of literature\r\nand art, to that of religion, and brought people to accept a teaching\r\nwhich appealed more strongly to the heart than that of the older school\r\nof clergy. While most of the work of the evangelicals lies outside our\r\nsubject, the character of its influence on society may be gathered from\r\ntheir efforts for the suppression of the slave trade; from the stricter\r\nobservance of Sunday which became general towards the end of our period;\r\nfrom their plans for bettering the condition, and their care for the\r\neducation of the poor. The institution of Sunday schools was largely due\r\nto Robert Raikes, of Gloucester, who began his work in 1780. Six years\r\nlater some 200,000 children attended these schools, and in many cases\r\ngained in them their only education. The work was encouraged by the king\r\nand queen, and along with other efforts for the education of the poor\r\nwas helped forward by Hannah More, Wilberforce, and other evangelicals.\r\n\r\nApart from any religious movement, many laymen, among whom Burke holds a\r\nhigh place, strove to soften the hardness and cruelty of the age. There\r\nwas need of their efforts. The criminal law was fearfully severe. Early\r\nin the reign as many as 160 crimes were capital felonies, and the number\r\nwas constantly augmented. A theft of more than the value of twelve\r\npence by picking a pocket was punishable by death. This severity led to\r\nan increase of crime. The injured would not prosecute, juries would not\r\nconvict on clear evidence, judges recommended to mercy, and criminals\r\nwere emboldened by the chances of escape. The heavy punishments attached\r\nto light offences tended to multiply serious crimes; for a thief who\r\nknew that he might be hanged was tempted to commit murder rather than be\r\ncaught. Though only about a fifth of the capital sentences were carried\r\nout, executions were terribly numerous, especially between 1781 and\r\n1787. In 1783, at two consecutive executions, twenty persons were hanged\r\ntogether. Ninety-six were hanged at the Old Bailey in ten months in\r\n1785, and at the Lent assizes of that year there were twenty-one capital\r\nsentences at Kingston, twelve at Lincoln and sixteen at Gloucester, and\r\nin each town nine persons were hanged. Executions were popular\r\nspectacles; 80,000 persons are said to have been present at one at\r\nMoorfields in 1767, and over 20,000 assembled at Tyburn in 1773 to see a\r\nwoman burnt--she was previously strangled at the stake--for the murder\r\nof her husband. The ghastly procession to Tyburn was stopped in 1783,\r\nand executions were ordered to be carried out in front of the prison;\r\nand in 1790 the burning of women was abolished. Otherwise, in spite of\r\nBurke's efforts, the criminal law was not materially ameliorated till\r\nthe next century. The punishment of the pillory was one of its worst\r\nabuses. When inflicted for some popular act, such as libelling a\r\nminister, the offender was treated as a hero, but if a man's crime\r\noutraged the moral sense of the mob, he was exposed to horrible\r\nbarbarity. Two men were pelted to death, in 1763 and 1780, on the\r\npillory in London. After the second of these murders Burke brought the\r\nmatter before parliament; he was supported by Sir Charles Bunbury, who\r\nquoted a similar case at Bury, but the punishment was not abolished.\r\nWhipping was constantly inflicted, not merely on men but on women, and\r\nin public as well as privately. The poor were brutalised by cruel and\r\nindecent punishments, and were far too much under the power of\r\nmagistrates, some of them vicious and ignorant men, who had summary\r\njurisdiction in a large number of criminal cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRISONS AND POLICE._]\r\n\r\nThe prisons were horrible dens in which felons and debtors, men and\r\nwomen, old and young, were crowded together. Many of them had no\r\nwater-supply and very little air; some had no sewers, and where sewers\r\nexisted they were generally choked up. Great numbers died of gaol-fever\r\nand small-pox. In about half the county gaols debtors had no allowance\r\nof bread. Everywhere prisoners were exposed to extortion, and were\r\nsometimes detained in gaol after acquittal for non-payment of the\r\ngaolers' fees. Such was the state of things in 1773 when John Howard\r\nbegan to inquire into the condition of the prisons. He roused the\r\nattention of parliament and of the public to these abuses, and by 1779\r\nsome of the more flagrant of them were removed. He spent the remainder\r\nof his life in efforts to reform the prisons, and accomplished much,\r\nthough much still remained to be done. After 1776 convicts could no more\r\nbe transported to America, and male convicts were kept in hulks on the\r\nThames and elsewhere. These hulks soon became overcrowded, and in 1784\r\nthe old system of assigning convicts to employers in different parts of\r\nthe British dominions oversea was again adopted. The evils of this\r\nsystem were recognised, and it was decided to send criminals sentenced\r\nto transportation to New South Wales. A government was established;\r\nCaptain Phillip, of the navy, was appointed governor, and in 1787 took\r\nout the \"first fleet\" with convicts. He established a settlement at Port\r\nJackson, and founded a city which he called Sydney, after the then\r\nsecretary for home affairs. Such was the unworthy beginning of the\r\npresent magnificent colony of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nThe population outgrew the police system. Riots were frequent in times\r\nof scarcity or popular excitement, and often could only be quelled by\r\nsoldiers. Throughout the whole of our period highwaymen infested the\r\nroads; in 1774 Horace Walpole at Twickenham declared that it was\r\nscarcely safe to venture out by day; Lady Hertford had been attacked on\r\nHounslow Heath at three in the afternoon. Some daring robberies, two of\r\nthem of mails, were effected in 1791. In the earlier years of the reign\r\nsmuggling was carried on with amazing audacity, specially on the south\r\nand east coasts. It was calculated that 40,000 persons were engaged in\r\nit by sea and land, and that two-thirds of the tea and half the brandy\r\nconsumed in England paid no duty. Bands of armed smugglers rode up to\r\nLondon with their goods, and attempts to interfere with their trade were\r\nfiercely and often successfully resisted. Smuggling, however, was\r\nchecked, as we shall see, by the wise policy of Pitt. The weakness of\r\nthe police caused an alarming increase of crimes against property;\r\nfootpads stopped carriages even in Grosvenor Square and Piccadilly, and\r\nin 1792 the streets are said on good authority to have been unsafe by\r\nnight. With the exception of a few Bow street officers and some mounted\r\npatrols, the only police in London were parish constables and the\r\nwatchmen, many of them old and decrepit. The magistracy of Middlesex had\r\nlargely fallen into the hands of men described by Burke as \"the scum of\r\nthe earth,\" who used their office as a means of getting gain, and\r\nfrightful abuses were common.[179] In 1792 parliament established\r\nstipendiary magistrates appointed by the crown for the London police\r\ncourts, and a few police officers were attached to each court. This\r\nimportant reform would have been more effective if a larger number of\r\npolice had been placed under the orders of the new magistrates, for\r\nafter that date the police of London and its immediate neighbourhood\r\nconsisted of not more than 2,044 watchmen and patrols and 1,000\r\nconstables and other officers, of whom only 147 received pay and gave\r\ntheir whole time to police work.[180]\r\n\r\nThe general belief that the trade of Great Britain would be ruined by\r\nthe loss of the American colonies was not justified. Between 1783 and\r\n1800 her foreign trade and manufactures were developed at an\r\nextraordinary rate. The official value of English exports in 1760 was\r\nL14,694,970, and of imports L9,832,802; in 1783, of exports L13,896,415,\r\nand of imports L11,651,281; in 1800 the exports of Great Britain were\r\nofficially valued at L34,381,617, and the imports at L28,257,781.[181]\r\nHer foreign trade, which provided her with an extended market, was\r\nmaintained through her naval supremacy. Before 1780 the war with the\r\ncolonies had little effect on her trade; the declaration of the armed\r\nneutrality decreased its profits by increasing risks and raising the\r\nrate of insurance, but does not appear to have inflicted special injury\r\non any particular branch of it. The American shipping was destroyed and\r\nDutch commerce suffered severely. At the end of the war England was far\r\nstronger by sea than she was before it began; her manufactures,\r\nspecially of iron and cotton, began to develop rapidly, and she kept the\r\nAmerican trade. During the revolutionary war the French believed that\r\nthey could reduce England to impotence by ruining her commerce. They\r\nfailed to understand the consequences of her power at sea and the\r\nfirmness of the foundation on which her wealth rested. The ports of\r\nFrance and her allies were blockaded; England may be said to have\r\ncarried the greatest part of the trade of Europe, her manufactures\r\nflourished exceedingly, and foreign nations could not afford to abstain\r\nfrom purchasing them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LAISSEZ-FAIRE._]\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the expansion of manufactures and the industrial\r\nrevolution which accompanied it, a word may be said as to the attitude\r\nof the state towards these changes. For some two centuries it had been\r\nheld that it was the duty of the state to order trade with the object of\r\nincreasing the wealth and power of the nation, and a policy was followed\r\nof interference with trade and its conditions by regulations, bounties,\r\nand restrictions, which is called the mercantile system. To this policy\r\nbelong the navigation acts and the regulation of colonial trade and\r\nmanufactures for the benefit of the mother-country. The American\r\nrevolution dealt it a mortal blow. About the same time Adam Smith's work\r\nled to the idea that national wealth would increase if men were left to\r\nseek their own wealth without interference. While trade outgrew the old\r\nregulations which ordered its conditions, the system of state\r\ninterference became discredited, a new economic policy of\r\nnon-interference, called _laissez-faire_, took its place, and questions\r\nof trade, manufacture, wages, and other conditions of labour were\r\nincreasingly left to settle themselves. This reversed the policy long\r\nand successfully pursued by the whigs, who fostered trade as the basis\r\nof national prosperity. The tories on the other hand held that national\r\nprosperity was based on land, and desired to lighten its burdens by\r\ntaxing personal property, and we shall find Pitt distributing his\r\ntaxation widely and so as to fall mainly on the moneyed class.[182]\r\n_Laissez-faire_ reached its full development in the establishment of\r\nfree trade; it has already been modified in many respects, and may\r\nhereafter be subjected to further modification to suit altered\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of trade during our period was due to improved processes\r\nof manufacture and increased facilities of transport, and in a far\r\nhigher degree to the substitution of machinery moved by the power of\r\nwater or steam for manual labour. The north, hitherto the most backward\r\npart of England, became the chief seat of industrial life and commercial\r\nenterprise. Wealth was increased, industry became more dependent on\r\ncapital, and changes were effected in its conditions which for a time\r\npressed heavily on the poor. In 1760 there was no Black Country.\r\nCharcoal was employed in the manufacture of hardware, and the Sussex\r\niron works produced a small quantity of pig-iron at a great cost. Fuel\r\nwas giving out, and England, rich in iron, imported over 49,000 tons of\r\niron a year from Russia and Sweden. The discovery that coal and coke\r\ncould be used for smelting was made about 1750, and in 1760 a new era in\r\nthe manufacture was ushered in by the foundation of the Carron\r\nironworks, which had blast furnaces for coal. The improvements in\r\nNewcomen's steam engine, effected by Watt between 1765 and 1782,\r\nfacilitated smelting by coal by providing the furnaces with a stronger\r\nblast. In 1783-4 Cort of Gosport invented processes for converting\r\npig-iron into malleable by the use of coal, and for converting malleable\r\niron into bars by rollers, instead of sledge-hammers. Iron became cheap\r\nand was used for purposes never dreamt of a few years before; the first\r\niron bridge crossed the Severn at Coalbrookdale in 1779. By 1796 the use\r\nof charcoal had almost ceased, and the produce of blast furnaces had\r\nrisen from 68,300 tons in 1788 to over 125,000 tons. Vast iron works\r\nwere established in the coal districts, which soon ceased to be\r\nagricultural. Among the many other manufactures expanded by new\r\nprocesses was that of pottery. In 1760 Staffordshire stoneware was rough\r\nand badly glazed, and much ware was imported from France. A few years\r\nlater Wedgwood succeeded in producing a ware at his works at Etruria\r\nwhich was superior to any brought from abroad; it was largely used in\r\nEngland, and five-sixths of the produce of his works was exported.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION._]\r\n\r\nThe increasing call for coal both for manufacture and for fuel and the\r\nneeds consequent on the growth of trade and the expansion of agriculture\r\nwere met by greater facilities of transport. Roads, though they were\r\ngradually improved, could not have answered the demands for the\r\nconveyance of the ever-increasing bulk of heavy goods. A better method\r\nwas found in the introduction of canals by the third Duke of\r\nBridgewater. The canal between Worsley and Manchester, made by him and\r\nhis engineer, Brindley, and opened in 1761, enabled the Manchester\r\npeople to buy the duke's coal at 3-1/2d. instead of 7d. a cwt.; its\r\nextension to Runcorn reduced the cost of carriage by water between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester from 12s. to 6s. a ton, while by road it was\r\n40s.; and the Grand Trunk canal from Runcorn to the Trent brought the\r\npottery of Etruria to Liverpool and carried other goods at a quarter of\r\nthe old cost of transport. The success of these undertakings was so\r\ngreat that people went wild about canal-making, and between 1790 and\r\n1794 eighty-one canal acts were obtained, many of them, of course, for\r\nsuperfluous projects.\r\n\r\nThe principal factor in the industrial revolution which began during the\r\nperiod under review was the substitution of machinery for hand labour in\r\ntextile manufactures. In 1760 spinning and weaving were domestic\r\nindustries, carried on, that is, in the homes of the workers. The women\r\nand children in farm-houses and cottages spent their spare time in\r\nspinning. The implements used in the cotton manufacture remained nearly\r\nas simple as those of the Homeric age, save that weaving had been\r\nfacilitated by the use of the fly-shuttle. Since that invention the\r\nweaver found it difficult to obtain enough yarn for his loom, until,\r\nabout 1767, a weaver named Hargreaves invented the spinning-jenny by\r\nwhich a child could work many spindles at once. Two years later\r\nArkwright, who introduced many inventions into the textile manufacture,\r\nbrought out a spinning machine worked by water-power. His water-frame\r\nspun automatically and produced a yarn strong enough for warp, so that\r\nfor the first time pure cotton goods were manufactured in England, for\r\nuntil then the cotton weft was woven on a warp of linen. This machine\r\nwas improved on by Crompton's mule, a cross between the jenny and the\r\nwater-frame, which spun a finer yarn, and so started the manufacture of\r\nmuslin in England; it was invented in 1775 and came into general use\r\nabout ten years later. The supply of cotton from India, the Bahamas,\r\nand later from the southern states of America, was large, and the effect\r\nof the new machinery on the manufacture can be gauged by the increase in\r\nthe import of cotton-wool from an average of 4,764,589 lbs. between 1771\r\nand 1775 to 56,010,732 lbs. in 1800. The new labour-saving inventions\r\nwere at first regarded with jealousy by the workmen. Hargreaves had his\r\nhouse gutted and his loom destroyed, and in 1799 a violent riot broke\r\nout about Blackburn; Arkwright's works were burnt, and many machines in\r\nthe neighbourhood were broken to pieces. In and around Lancashire, where\r\nthe manufacture was chiefly carried on, the carding and spinning of wool\r\nceased to be domestic industries. Capitalists set up factories where\r\nwater-power was available, in which children were largely employed, and\r\nfactory villages grew up round them. From about 1790 steam-power began\r\ngradually to take the place of water-power; the change was slow, and as\r\nit went on the manufacture became increasingly centred in populous\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nCotton weaving remained a domestic industry, for Cartwright's power-loom\r\ndid not come into general use until after 1800. The output of yarn was\r\nenormous, and for a time the weavers' earnings were very large, but the\r\nmoney which could be earned at the loom and the failure of domestic\r\nspinning caused so many to take to weaving that by 1800 wages had begun\r\nto decline, and gradually a period of distress set in. A machine for\r\ncalico-printing further increased the profits of the capitalist and had\r\na bad effect on labour, for it threw the calico-printer out of\r\nemployment. Wool spinning was far more generally carried on in rural\r\ndistricts than cotton spinning, and more widely spread misery was caused\r\nby changes in the manufacture. It came under the dominion of machinery\r\nsomewhat later. Machines for carding and combing took the place of\r\nmanual labour after 1790, and enabled one man and a few children to do\r\nthe work of many men. Spinning with the wheel lasted longer than in the\r\ncotton manufacture. From 1785 jennies were used, and wool spinning was\r\ngradually transferred to factories and became a separate business,\r\ninstead of a by-employment which helped the small farmer to pay his rent\r\nand eked out the scanty wages of the labourer. The change was\r\naccelerated by the scarcity of wool during the revolutionary war, for\r\nby that time the trade had become largely dependent on importation from\r\nSpain, and it was not until about 1800 that sheep began to be bred for\r\ntheir wool in Australia. As in the cotton trade, the wages of weavers\r\nwere high during the war, but the scarcity of material prevented all but\r\nthe best workmen from finding employment and there was much distress\r\namong the rest. The failure of domestic spinning deeply affected all the\r\nrural districts of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AGRICULTURAL WAGES._]\r\n\r\nIt was specially disastrous because it was accompanied by times of\r\nscarceness and by changes connected with a revolution in agriculture\r\nwhich pressed heavily on many of the poorer classes. A rapid increase in\r\npopulation during the latter part of the century was consequent on the\r\nstimulus given to manufacture; in 1760 the population of England and\r\nWales is estimated at 6,479,700, and of Scotland in 1755 at about\r\n1,265,300; in 1800 the estimate for England and Wales is 9,187,176, and\r\nfor Scotland about 1,599,000. This increase implies a demand for a\r\nlarger supply of food. Early in the reign wages were low except near\r\ngreat towns, and the law of settlement prevented the labourer from\r\nmoving freely from one parish to another in order to better himself.\r\nWhile in 1769-70 labourers in Surrey earned on an average from 8s. to\r\n10s. a week, in Wiltshire they received only 6s. 2d. to 5s. 3d., and in\r\none district in Lancashire as little as 4s. 11d.[183] Wages, however,\r\nwere then eked out by home industries and commonable rights. Yet the\r\nmargin between income and expenditure was so small that a rise in the\r\nprice of bread soon caused distress, and was often followed by riots.\r\nBread made from rye or barley was still eaten in poor districts, but\r\nwheaten bread was more generally used than earlier in the century, which\r\nproves that the condition of the poor was bettered. In 1769 it cost 2d.\r\na pound near London, and at a distance of 150 miles 1-1/2d. Meat was\r\nabout 3d. to 4d. a pound, rent and clothing were cheap, firing and\r\ncandles very dear.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 England was still a corn-exporting country; importation was\r\nrestrained, exportation encouraged by a bounty, and in times of scarcity\r\nthe trade was regulated by temporary enactments. After some bad harvests\r\nan act was made in 1773 with the object of keeping the price steady at\r\nabout 48s. the quarter; virtually free importation was allowed when it\r\nreached that limit, and exportation was forbidden when it reached 44s.\r\nLandowners and farmers were dissatisfied, and a general fear lest the\r\ncountry should become dependent on foreign corn led parliament in 1791\r\nto adopt a policy of encouraging home production; it was enacted that\r\nfor the future a bounty should be paid on exportation when the price was\r\nat 44s., that prohibitive duties should be placed on importation when it\r\nwas below 50s., and virtually free importation only allowed above 54s.\r\nNevertheless from about that date England definitely ceased to be able\r\nto feed her own people, except in good seasons. Her naval superiority\r\nduring the revolutionary war prevented a stoppage in the supply of wheat\r\nfrom abroad; but it became uncertain, prices fluctuated violently with\r\ngood or bad harvests; war acted as a protection to the corn-grower and\r\nbad harvests were followed by famine prices; in 1795 wheat averaged 81s.\r\n6d. in Windsor market, and in 1800 reached 127s. Wages rose with the\r\nexpansion of manufactures, but not in anything like proportion to the\r\nrise in prices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile efforts were made to meet the increased demand for food by\r\nimproved agriculture. In 1760 about half the parishes in England were\r\nstill in open fields; and the primitive two-field and three-field\r\nsystems by which land was refreshed by lying fallow were, with some\r\nmodifications, still in vogue. A new husbandry, however, had begun, and\r\nsoon made rapid progress; it was promoted by many large landowners, such\r\nas Lord Townshend, the Dukes of Bedford and Grafton, and Lord\r\nRockingham, and the king took a lively and practical interest in the\r\nmovement. Its advantages were urged by Arthur Young, who did most\r\nvaluable work as its apostle. Its leading feature was the introduction\r\nof a scientific rotation of crops founded on the use of clover and\r\nrye-grass and the more careful cultivation of turnips, which kept the\r\nland at once employed and in good heart, and afforded a supply of\r\nexcellent fodder. Farmers, too, began to learn the profit to be derived\r\nfrom marling, manuring, and subsoil drainage, and to use better\r\nimplements which did their work more thoroughly and with less labour of\r\nman and beast. The increased demand for meat caused sheep no longer to\r\nbe valued chiefly for their wool, or oxen as beasts of draught.\r\nImprovements in the breeding and rearing of sheep and cattle were\r\nintroduced by Bakewell, a Lincolnshire grazier, and carried on by\r\nothers. The scraggy animals of earlier days disappeared; the average\r\nweight of beeves sold at Smithfield in 1710 was 370 lbs., in 1795 it was\r\n800 lbs., and that of sheep had risen from 28 lbs. to 80 lbs. Capital\r\nwas freely invested in land; open fields were increasingly enclosed, and\r\ncommons and wastes along with them, and land until then beyond the\r\nmargin of cultivation was taken in and ploughed. From 1760 to 1797 as\r\nmany as 1,539 private enclosure acts were passed, and a general act was\r\npassed in 1801.\r\n\r\nThe new agriculture vastly increased the produce of the land. During the\r\nfirst half of our period rents were low, and the farmers who carried out\r\nthe new system as a rule made enormous profits. Arthur Young tells us of\r\none Norfolk farmer who, on a farm of 1,500 acres, made enough in thirty\r\nyears to buy an estate of L1,700 a year. The improved agriculture,\r\nhowever, could not be carried out without enclosure and, unless an award\r\nwas made by agreement, that meant a large initial expense, which was\r\nfollowed by the expense of actually enclosing the land. These expenses\r\nwere often borne by the landlords. The small squires and yeomen who\r\nfarmed their own land had neither the intelligence of the large farmers\r\nnor the money to spend on improvements, and both classes virtually\r\ndisappeared. Nor could the small farmer either keep his place or take\r\nadvantage of the new system. If his holding was unaffected by enclosure,\r\nthe loss of domestic industries rendered him less able to pay his rent:\r\nif it was to be enclosed, he found himself with a diminished income at\r\nthe very time when he most needed money; and if he managed to keep his\r\nland for a while, he was ruined by some violent fluctuation in the price\r\nof corn. Sooner or later he sank into the labouring class. The enormous\r\nprofits of the large farmers did not continue, for about 1780 rents\r\nbegan to rise. Still the cultivation of good arable land remained highly\r\nprofitable, if the farmer had capital enough to meet fluctuations of\r\nprice. But war prices and parliamentary encouragement led farmers to\r\ncultivate inferior land; their profits diminished in proportion to the\r\ncost of cultivation, and though the supply of food was increased, its\r\nprice was kept up. A sudden fall in prices would send the land back to\r\nits original wild state and was likely enough to ruin the farmer.\r\n\r\nAlthough enclosure was encouraged by parliament with the view of\r\nbenefiting the mass of the people by making bread cheaper, it was far\r\nmore often than not injurious to the labourer. In many cases commons\r\nwere enclosed without adequate compensation to the poorer commoners, who\r\nwere deprived of the means of keeping a cow or geese or of the right of\r\ncutting turf for fuel. Some received no allotment because they failed to\r\nprove their claims, and others sold their allotments to wealthy farmers,\r\neither because they were too small to keep a cow or because they could\r\nnot enclose them. Young, who strongly advocated enclosure, says that out\r\nof thirty-seven parishes he found only twelve in which the position of\r\nthe poor had not been injured by the enclosure of commons, and laments\r\nthe disastrous effect of the change on the general condition of the\r\nlabouring class. The change was coincident with the decay not only of\r\ndomestic spinning, but also of other industries practised in villages,\r\nfor the large new-fashioned farmers had their implements, harness, and\r\nhousehold utensils made and mended in towns rather than by rural\r\nworkmen. Deprived of the profits of by-employments, and in many cases of\r\ntheir accustomed rights of common, labourers became solely dependent on\r\nfarm wages at a time when prices were enormously high and a living-wage\r\nwas not to be gained by agricultural work. They either migrated to seek\r\nwork in a factory or came on the rates. In many districts villages\r\npresented a picture of desolation. Wiston and Foston in Leicestershire\r\neach before enclosure contained some thirty-five houses; in Wiston every\r\nhouse disappeared except that of the squire, and Foston was reduced to\r\nthe parsonage and two herdsmen's cottages.[184]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMBINATIONS OF WORKMEN._]\r\n\r\nThe old system of regulating wages by statute was not wholly extinct in\r\n1760. A few years later a statute made in the masters' interests fixed\r\nthe maximum for the wages of the London journeymen tailors at 2s.\r\n7-1/2d. a day, except at a time of general mourning. On the other hand\r\nparliament, in 1773, under the pressure of a riot, passed an act\r\nempowering justices to fix the wages of the Spitalfields silk weavers\r\nand to enforce their ordinance. By 1776, however, Adam Smith declared\r\nthat the custom of fixing wages \"had gone entirely into disuse\". England\r\nwas adopting _laissez-faire_. The change of policy is illustrated by\r\nthe case of the framework knitters of Nottinghamshire. The employment of\r\nchildren and apprentices enabled the masters to oppress them; they were\r\nunable to earn more than 8s. to 9s. a week and their wages were\r\ndiminished by shameful exactions. They formed a combination, petitioned\r\nthe house of commons to regulate their wages in 1778, and were heard\r\nbefore a committee. A bill was brought in the next year to regulate the\r\ntrade and prevent abuses, but was thrown out on the third reading. Wages\r\nwere to be settled between the master and the men. Some rioting followed\r\non the rejection of the bill, and the masters promised redress, but soon\r\nbroke their word. Combinations of workmen to set aside statutory\r\narrangements of wages were of course illegal, but when formed to secure\r\ntheir fulfilment do not seem to have been so regarded.[185] In 1799,\r\nhowever, when parliament was anxious to prevent seditious assemblies, a\r\nstatute, amended in 1800, rendered it unlawful for workmen to combine\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining higher wages. This grossly unjust law made\r\nthe workmen powerless to protect themselves against the oppression of\r\nthe capitalist employer. Parliament was more than once pressed to meet\r\nthe high price of bread and the distress of the agricultural poor by\r\nfixing a minimum for wages. Pitt, a disciple of Adam Smith, would not\r\nconsent to such a measure, and his opposition was fatal to it. He was\r\ndeeply sensible of the distress of the poor, and, in 1795, brought in a\r\nbill for the amendment of the poor law. It contained some startling\r\nprovisions of a socialistic character, was adversely criticised by\r\nBentham and others, and was quietly dropped.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 the law of 1723, empowering overseers of the poor to refuse\r\nrelief to those who would not enter the workhouse, was still in force.\r\nIt seems to have been administered strictly, and it kept down the rates.\r\nAs society became more humane, it revolted against so harsh a method of\r\ndealing with distress. A permissive act of 1783, called after its\r\npromoter, Gilbert's act, contained along with some wholesome provisions\r\nothers that were foolish and harmful; it enabled parishes to form unions\r\nand adopt a system under which able-bodied men were not allowed to enter\r\nthe workhouse; they were to work in the district and have their wages\r\nsupplemented from the rates. The administration of the act was committed\r\nto the magistrates and guardians in place of the overseers. A\r\nconsiderable relaxation of the law of settlement in 1795 was just and\r\nbeneficial. In the same year the pernicious principle of supplementing\r\nwages from the rates was carried to its full extent. By that time the\r\ndecay of domestic spinning and the rise in the price of food were\r\ncausing much distress in Berkshire. At a meeting of justices at\r\nSpeenhamland in that county it was resolved to grant allowances to all\r\npoor men and their families--so much a head according to the price of\r\nthe gallon loaf. This system was generally adopted, and was strengthened\r\nby an act of 1795 abolishing the workhouse test. As a means of tiding\r\nover a merely temporary crisis, as indeed it was intended by its authors\r\nto be, it would have done no harm. Unfortunately, it lasted for many\r\nyears and had disastrous consequences; it rapidly raised the rates, and\r\nhelped to crush the small farmers who, though they employed no labour,\r\nwere forced to pay towards the maintenance of the labourers employed by\r\ntheir richer neighbours; it kept wages from rising, encouraged\r\nthriftless marriages and dissolute living, discouraged industry and\r\nefficient work, destroyed self-respect, and pauperised the poor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FACTORY CHILDREN._]\r\n\r\nWhile then the last sixteen years of the century, of which the political\r\nhistory still lies before us, were, except at certain crises to be noted\r\nhereafter, marked by a rapid expansion of commerce and trade, and an\r\nincrease in the wealth of the richer landowners, manufacturers, and\r\nmerchants, they were, as we have seen, a period of change in the\r\nconditions of labour and, as such, brought much distress on the working\r\nclass, which was aggravated by the high prices consequent on bad seasons\r\nand the risks of war. Of all the sufferings of the poor during this\r\nperiod none are so painful to remember as those of the children employed\r\nin factories, the helpless victims of _laissez-faire_ for whose relief\r\nthe state did nothing until a later date. The greater number of them\r\nwere pauper apprentices bound by parochial authorities to mill-owners,\r\nothers the children of very poor or callous parents. From little more\r\nthan infancy, sometimes under seven years old, children were condemned\r\nto labour for long hours, thirteen or more in a day, at tasks which\r\nrequired unremitting attention, and in rooms badly ventilated and\r\notherwise injurious to health; they were half-starved and cruelly\r\npunished when their wearied little arms failed to keep up with the\r\ndemands of the machinery. The smaller mills were the worst in this\r\nrespect, and as the supply of water-power was not constant, the children\r\nin mills worked by water were often forced to labour far beyond their\r\nstrength to make up for lost time. Such of them as survived the\r\nprolonged misery and torture of their early years often grew up more or\r\nless stunted and deformed men and women, physically unfit for parentage,\r\nmorally debased, ignorant, and brutalised by ill-treatment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Walpole to Mann, April 29, 1784, _Letters_, viii., 473; _Parl.\r\nHist._, xxv., 1434.\r\n\r\n[179] _Parl.

Humiliated by the loss of its\r\ncolonies, irritated by the mismanagement of its affairs, and burdened\r\nwith the expense of an unsuccessful war, which added L114,500,000 to the\r\npublic debt, the nation listened with approval to Fox's denunciations\r\nand got rid of North. It was with unbounded disgust that it saw Fox\r\nenter into an alliance with the statesman whom he had denounced as the\r\nprime cause of its misfortunes. During the late conflict in parliament\r\npublic feeling grew strong against him. The king's dismissal of a\r\nministry which commanded a large majority in the house of commons, and\r\nhis refusal to dismiss its successor at the request of the house needed\r\nno pardon; they were endorsed by the declaration of the national will,\r\nand he gained a hold on the affection of his people such as he had never\r\nhad before. His success must not make us forget the courage and the\r\npolitical insight which he displayed during this critical period. All\r\nthat made the crown worth wearing was at stake, for if Fox's party had\r\nobtained a majority at the general election, George for the rest of his\r\nlife would have become a mere puppet in their hands. He won the game,\r\nbut he did not win all that he hoped for. Pitt, whom he chose as his\r\nchampion, was not a minister after his own heart, content to carry out a\r\nroyal policy. George freed himself from the danger of whig domination,\r\nbut he did so at the cost of resigning his hopes of establishing a\r\nsystem of personal government, and accepted an independent prime\r\nminister. He never liked Pitt, but he knew that Pitt stood between him\r\nand Fox, and so for seventeen years was content that he should retain\r\noffice. Pitt's power was established by, and rested on, the will of the\r\nnation. In 1784 England looked forward with hope to the rule of a young\r\nminister, a son of the great Chatham, of stainless private character and\r\nunimpeachable integrity, who was free from all responsibility for its\r\nmisfortunes, and was the victorious opponent of Fox, whom it regarded\r\nwith aversion. Nor did its hope fail of fulfilment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LASTING CHANGES EFFECTED BY PITT._]\r\n\r\nWhat the government did for England during the nine years of peace which\r\nsucceeded the election of 1784 may be said to have been done by Pitt.\r\nHis colleagues were not men of great capacity, and he received obedience\r\nrather than counsel from them. So it was that the position of prime\r\nminister, a title which North refused to accept, became finally\r\nestablished. This unavowed change in the constitution settled the sphere\r\nof political action open to the crown. Government by the crown through\r\ndepartmental ministers acting independently of each other was no longer\r\npossible. The principle of the homogeneous character of the cabinet and\r\nof the prime minister's position in it were, as we shall see, decisively\r\nsettled in 1791 by the dismissal of the chancellor, who, relying on the\r\nking's favour, wore out Pitt's patience by rebellion against his\r\nauthority. Pitt's strength of character and the king's dependence on him\r\ncaused the gradual extinction of the \"king's friends\" as a party\r\ndistinct from the supporters of the government. The leader of the party\r\nJenkinson, the secretary at war in North's ministry, had great\r\ncommercial knowledge; Pitt made him president of the new board of trade\r\nwhich was constituted in 1785, and as Lord Hawkesbury and as Earl of\r\nLiverpool he gave the prime minister his support. Pitt did not attempt\r\nto reduce the crown to a cypher, and George exercised a strong and\r\nlegitimate influence in politics, as adviser of the cabinet, though Pitt\r\noccasionally acted against his wishes.\r\n\r\nAnother change of lasting importance effected by Pitt was in the\r\ncharacter of the house of lords. In 1760 the whole number of peers,\r\nincluding minors and Roman catholics, who were incapable of sitting in\r\nthe house, was only 174; the house was then the stronghold of the whig\r\noligarchy. During North's administration about thirty peers were created\r\nor promoted. Under Pitt the invasion advanced far more rapidly.\r\nEconomical reform deprived the minister of the power of rewarding his\r\nsupporters with places and pensions, and Pitt used peerages and minor\r\nhonours in their stead. George, who did not approve of a large increase\r\nin the peerage,[186] was forced to yield to his minister's exigencies.\r\nIn five years Pitt was responsible for forty-eight creations and\r\npromotions, and by 1801 the number reached 140.[187] The house of lords\r\nceased to be a small assembly of territorial magnates, mostly of the\r\nwhig party; it became less aristocratic, for peerages were bestowed on\r\nmen simply because they were supporters of the government and were\r\nwealthy; it became mainly tory in politics, and its size made it less\r\nopen to corrupt influence. As a body, however, it was inferior in\r\nability and in devotion to its legislative duties to the small assembly\r\nof earlier days.\r\n\r\nUnder Pitt's leadership, England during the years of peace which\r\nsucceeded the American war regained her place in the politics of Europe.\r\nHis attention, however, was chiefly devoted to domestic affairs. He was\r\neminently skilful in finance; he restored the public credit and freed\r\ntrade from artificial impediments. The corruption of parliament, of\r\nwhich both whigs and tories had been guilty, was brought to an end; many\r\nabuses and sinecures were abolished and public life became purer. Though\r\nat first Pitt sustained some defeats in parliament, due both to mistakes\r\nof his own and to the absence of party consolidation among his usual\r\nsupporters, his power rapidly increased until it became absolute in both\r\nhouses. He showed supreme ability in the management of parliament. With\r\nmuch of his father's haughtiness of manner he combined a tactfulness and\r\nself-control which his father never exhibited. He had nothing of Fox's\r\nwinning power, yet he became extremely popular in the house of commons,\r\nfor he showed himself worthy to lead men and able to lead them\r\nsuccessfully. His temper was sweet, his courage, patience, and\r\nhopefulness unfailing, and his industry unwearied. That he loved power\r\nis surely no reproach to a statesman who used it as he did with\r\nsingle-hearted devotion to his country. For wealth and honours he cared\r\nnothing. He was always poor, and soon became deeply in debt, chiefly\r\nbecause he was too much occupied with public affairs to control his\r\nhousehold expenditure. While he disdainfully distributed titles and\r\nribbons among a clamouring crowd, he refused all such things for\r\nhimself. Some measures of reform which he advocated in early days he\r\ndropped when he found that the country did not care for them, and in\r\nlater days altogether abandoned a liberal policy, for he was called on\r\nto give England that which is infinitely more important than liberal\r\nmeasures, the preservation of its constitutional and social life from\r\nthe danger of revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE WESTMINSTER SCRUTINY._]\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met on May 19, 1784, the ministry carried the address in\r\nthe commons by 282 to 114. Pitt, however, soon found that he could not\r\nreckon on this majority on every question. In the Westminster election\r\nFox had been opposed by Admiral Lord Hood, created an Irish baron after\r\nthe battle of the Saints, and Sir Cecil Wray. The poll was kept open for\r\nforty days and there was much rioting and irregularity of every kind,\r\nfor which both sides appear to have been responsible. Fox's friends, and\r\nabove all the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire and other whig ladies,\r\ncanvassed eagerly for him, and the duchess is said to have bought a\r\nbutcher's vote with a kiss. George watched the contest with anxiety, for\r\nFox's attack on the constitutional rights of the crown had deepened his\r\nanimosity towards him. So strong were his feelings that, on hearing that\r\nFox was gaining votes, he wrote to Pitt that \"the advance could only be\r\nby bad votes, yet similar means must be adopted against him rather than\r\nlet him get returned\". He had heard with delight that 300 Quackers\r\n(_sic_) would vote for Hood and Wray.[188] At the close of the poll Hood\r\nstood first and Fox second. Great was the triumph of the Foxites, and\r\nthe Prince of Wales, Fox's pupil in debauchery, was pleased to exhibit\r\nhis opposition to his father by taking a prominent part in it; he wore\r\nFox's colours, was present at banquets in his honour, where he gave the\r\ntoast of \"True Blue and Mrs. Crewe,\" one of Fox's lady canvassers, and\r\ngot disgustingly drunk. Nevertheless the victory was disputed, for the\r\nhigh-bailiff granted a scrutiny, and instead of returning Hood and Fox\r\nas elected, merely reported the number of the votes. In this he was\r\nclearly wrong, for he made no proper return to the writ. If a scrutiny\r\nwas to be held, it should have been completed before the day fixed for\r\nthe return. It was his duty to make a return on that day; a decision as\r\nto the lawfulness of the election pertained to the house of commons.\r\nHis action deprived Westminster of representation, and would have shut\r\nFox out of the house had he not already been returned for Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nFox petitioned the house to order the high-bailiff to make a proper\r\nreturn. Pitt opposed the petition, and the house ordered that the\r\nscrutiny should proceed, though in two divisions on the question his\r\nmajority fell to 97 and 78. Eight months later, in February, 1785, the\r\nscrutiny was still proceeding and was likely to last two years longer.\r\nAgainst the king's judgment,[189] Pitt persisted in maintaining it; his\r\nmajority sank to 39, then to 9, and on March 4 he was in a minority of\r\n38. The high-bailiff was ordered to make an immediate return, and Hood\r\nand Fox were returned as elected. In this matter Pitt did not display\r\nhis usual tactfulness. Excusably enough in so young a man, he allowed\r\nhimself to be swayed by personal feeling, and his feeling was\r\nungenerous. With the exception of a small knot of friends like Dundas,\r\nhe kept himself aloof from his supporters and was ignorant of the\r\nannoyance with which they regarded this attempt to deal harshly with a\r\ndefeated foe.[190] A bill passed that session ordered that polls were\r\nnot to last more than fifteen days, and that any scrutiny should be\r\nclosed six days before the return to the writ was due. Fox sued the\r\nhigh-bailiff for neglecting to return him and obtained L2,000 damages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S FINANCE._]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this mistake Pitt's position was strengthened by his success\r\nin dealing with finance. National credit was low; the public debt of\r\nGreat Britain had grown from L126,043,057 in 1775 to L240,925,908,[191]\r\nand the 3 per cent. consols were at about 57. Heavy expenses entailed by\r\nthe late war were still to be met, the civil list was in arrear, and the\r\nrevenue was grievously diminished by smuggling. In order to make\r\nsmuggling less profitable, Pitt largely reduced the duties on tea and\r\nforeign spirits, and made up the loss on the tea duties by a\r\n\"commutation tax,\" an increased duty on houses according to the number\r\nof their windows. He also made smuggling more difficult by a \"hovering\r\nact,\" which subjected to seizure vessels hovering off the coast with any\r\nconsiderable quantity of tea or spirits. A deficit of L6,000,000 he\r\nsupplied by a loan, and in raising this loan he abandoned the old evil\r\npractice of allotment among selected subscribers and opened it to public\r\ncompetition. A second point on which he made a new departure was his\r\ndeclaration that all sound finance should be directed towards\r\nextinguishing debt and that consequently \"a fund at a high rate of\r\ninterest was better for the country than those at low rates\". The\r\nunfunded debts were large, those ascertained amounted to L14,000,000,\r\nand as outstanding government bills were at a discount of 15 to 20 per\r\ncent., these debts depressed the funds. Pitt at once funded nearly half\r\nas an instalment. Lastly the required charges exceeded revenue by over\r\nL900,000, an enormous sum for that time, and he proposed to make up the\r\ndeficiency by taxation.\r\n\r\nThe number of the new taxes is a third point specially to be noted in\r\nhis budget. One proposed tax, on coals, he withdrew in deference to\r\ngeneral opinion, and substituted others in its place. The rest met with\r\nlittle opposition. As they finally stood they were laid on candles,\r\nbricks and tiles, hats, pleasure horses and horses entered for races,\r\nBritish linens and cottons, ribbons and gauzes, ale-licences, shooting\r\nlicences, paper, hackney coaches, gold and silver plate, exported lead,\r\npostage, and imported raw and thrown silk. His speech on the budget,\r\nduring which he moved 133 resolutions, at once placed his talents as a\r\nfinance minister beyond dispute; it was admirably lucid and was\r\nconciliatory in tone. He also carried some regulations checking the\r\nabuse of the privilege of franking letters. In those days a letter which\r\nbore on the outside the signature of a member of parliament was carried\r\npost-free, and franks were given away with the utmost profusion. It was\r\ncalculated that the new regulations, without abolishing the privilege,\r\nwould increase the revenue by L20,000. The next year, 1785, Pitt\r\ncompleted the funding of unfunded debt, choosing according to his\r\nprinciple the 5 per cents. which, though entailing an immediate loss,\r\nafforded an easy means of paying off debt. He was able to declare that\r\nthe revenues were in a flourishing state, and to speak of the\r\ninstitution of a fund for the repayment of the national debt as in the\r\nnear future. He was, however, still obliged to raise L400,000 by new\r\ntaxes. Among these were an increased tax on male servants, graduated\r\naccording to the number kept, and two which excited much hostile\r\ncriticism, the one a tax on female servants, also graduated, two\r\nshillings and sixpence on one, five shillings a head on two, and ten\r\nshillings a head on three or more, and the other a tax on shops. Both\r\nthese taxes were unpopular; the shop tax was repealed in 1789 and the\r\ntax on female servants in 1792.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 the East India company was applying to parliament for help, and\r\nas its affairs were under investigation it was unable to declare a\r\ndividend. Pitt carried bills authorising a dividend of 8 per cent., and\r\ngranting the company relief from obligations to the exchequer which the\r\nlate war made specially onerous. He then brought in his new bill for the\r\ngovernment of India. This measure, which was not materially different\r\nfrom his bill of six months before, entirely subordinated the political\r\npower exercised by the directors to a board of control consisting of\r\nunpaid commissioners, a secretary of state, the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer, and other privy councillors, appointed by the crown. The\r\npatronage of India was to be retained by the directors, but the\r\ngovernor-general and the presidents and members of councils were to be\r\nappointed and to be removable by the crown. In all matters of peace and\r\nwar the governor-general and his council were to be supreme over the\r\nminor presidencies. Regulations were made to prevent extortion by the\r\nofficers of the company, and a special court was instituted for the\r\ntrial of those charged with delinquencies. The bill was violently\r\nopposed by Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and Hastings's enemy, Francis, chiefly\r\non the grounds that government and patronage ought not to be divided,\r\nthat the nominal sovereignty of the directors and the extensive power of\r\nthe board of control would lead to confusion, and that the\r\ngovernor-general ought not to have absolute authority in matters at a\r\ndistance. After several divisions, Pitt carried the second reading in\r\nthe commons by a majority of 211; he accepted some amendments in\r\ncommittee, and the bill finally passed both houses without a division.\r\nThus was established that system of double government which lasted until\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nThe session closed with a motion by Dundas for the restoration of the\r\nScottish estates forfeited for the rebellion of 1745. The bill was\r\nunanimously approved by the commons. Thurlow, who for some reason,\r\npossibly merely from jealousy of Pitt, adopted a generally malcontent\r\nattitude, spoke against it in the lords, but it passed there also\r\nwithout a division. Before the end of the year Pitt's success was\r\ndeclared by the accession to his ministry of old Lord Camden as\r\npresident of the council in the place of Lord Gower, who took the office\r\nof privy seal, vacated by the appointment of the Duke of Rutland as\r\nviceroy of Ireland in the previous February. Shelburne, who was deeply\r\noffended by his continued exclusion from office, was created Marquis of\r\nLansdowne with the promise that, if the king made any dukes outside his\r\nown family, he should be one of the number. He was not appeased by this\r\npromotion, and remained hostile to Pitt, who would have been weakened by\r\nhis alliance and lost nothing by his hostility. Temple, who also aspired\r\nto a dukedom, was created Marquis of Buckingham, and was encouraged to\r\nhope that his ambition might in the future be fully satisfied. The\r\nsession closed on August 20. Parliament did not meet again until January\r\n25, 1785, and from that time the custom of beginning the regular session\r\nbefore Christmas has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S PARLIAMENTARY REFORM BILL._]\r\n\r\nAs Pitt had already twice brought forward motions for parliamentary\r\nreform, in 1782 and 1783, the friends of the cause looked to him to\r\npromote it as head of the ministry. The question was not at that time\r\nexciting much public interest. The king was personally opposed to\r\nreform, and it was not until March, 1785, that Pitt obtained his assent\r\nto the introduction of a bill. He promised the king that if it was\r\nrejected he would not resign, unless \"those supposed to be connected\r\nwith government\" voted against it. George took the hint, and while he\r\nexpressed dislike of the bill to Pitt, assured him that he would not use\r\nany influence against it. Pitt did his best to insure the success of his\r\nbill, and even persuaded his friend Wilberforce to return from abroad to\r\nsupport it. He brought forward his motion on April 18. After defending\r\nhimself from the charge of innovation by pointing out that in past ages\r\nchanges had frequently been made in the representation, he laid down\r\nthat the representation of boroughs should depend not on locality but on\r\nthe number of voters. He proposed to disfranchise thirty-six decayed\r\nboroughs, and to add their seventy-two members to the representation of\r\ncounties and of London and Westminster. The boroughs were to be\r\ndisfranchised at their own request, which was to be obtained by the\r\npurchase of their franchise from a fund provided by the state. In the\r\nfuture any other borough which was, or became, so decayed as to fall\r\nbelow a standard fixed by parliament, was to be allowed to surrender its\r\nfranchise for an adequate payment, and its right would be transferred to\r\npopulous towns. He further proposed to extend the franchise to\r\ncopyholders, and in towns to householders.\r\n\r\nAccording to his plan L1,000,000 sterling was to be set aside for\r\ncompensation; 100 members would eventually be chosen by free and open\r\nconstituencies instead of by individuals or close corporations, and some\r\n99,000 persons would receive the franchise. North spoke ably against the\r\nmotion, dwelling on the coldness with which the country regarded the\r\nquestion; only eight petitions for reform were presented, and none came\r\nfrom Birmingham or Manchester. Fox opposed it on the ground that the\r\nfranchise was a trust, not a property, and that to offer to buy it was\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the constitution; and Burke objected to the\r\nalteration which it would make in the representation of interests by\r\nincreasing the influence of the country gentlemen. Pitt allowed that the\r\nscheme of purchase was a \"tender part\"; it was, he said, \"a necessary\r\nevil if any reform was to take place\". Leave to bring in the bill was\r\nrefused by 248 to 174. Pitt had not yet secured an organised majority.\r\nConnexion and influence had not wholly given way to a system of parties\r\nfounded on general agreement on political questions. There is no reason\r\nto suppose that the king broke his promise to Pitt, but his dislike of\r\nreform must have been well known, and probably had much weight. Pitt\r\nmade no more attempts at parliamentary reform, and for the next seven\r\nyears the question was of little importance in English politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REFORM DEMANDED IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nThe chief conflict of the session was fought over Pitt's scheme for\r\nestablishing free-trade with Ireland. An agitation for parliamentary\r\nreform in Ireland brought into prominence a spirit of discontent. The\r\nIrish parliament did not represent even the protestant population; the\r\nhouse of lords was composed of a large number of bishops, generally\r\nsubservient to the crown, and of lay lords, many of them lately ennobled\r\nfor political service; the house of commons of 300 members, scarcely a\r\nthird of them elected by the people. Flood urged reform on a strictly\r\nprotestant basis, and the cause of reform was supported by a convention\r\nof volunteers assembled at Dublin under Lord Charlemont. The Bishop of\r\nDerry, Lord Bristol, a vain and half-crazy prelate, advocated the\r\nadmission of catholics to the franchise, and tried to excite the\r\nvolunteers, who were then no longer exclusively protestant, and were\r\nrecruited from the rabble, to extort reform from parliament by force. He\r\nattended parliament with an escort of volunteers and in regal state, and\r\nappeared in a purple coat and volunteer cap fiercely cocked. His\r\nseditious behaviour, the claim made for the catholics, and the violence\r\nof the democratic party caused a division among the volunteers and among\r\nthe advocates of reform generally. Charlemont and Flood himself checked\r\nthe violent party in the convention, which was dissolved peacefully.\r\nFlood's motions for reform were rejected, and the volunteer movement\r\nlost political importance. Pitt regarded parliamentary reform in Ireland\r\nas certain if it were adopted in England, and was prepared to welcome\r\nit, but was at that time determined to maintain the exclusion of the\r\ncatholics from the franchise. The Irish administration was opposed to a\r\nchange of system, and the Duke of Rutland, the viceroy, a young man of\r\ngreat ability, held that the state of the country would render it\r\ndangerous. The defeat of Flood's last attempt at reform, in 1785, left\r\nthe Irish parliament as before without \"the smallest resemblance to\r\nrepresentation\".[192]\r\n\r\nIn face of the threatened interference in politics of an armed force, of\r\ndiscontent and disloyalty, and foreseeing difficulties in the future\r\nbetween the independent Irish parliament and the imperial government,\r\nRutland prophesied in 1784 that \"without an union Ireland would not be\r\nconnected with Great Britain in twenty years longer\".[193] Pitt hoped to\r\npacify discontent by benefiting Irish trade, and to unite the two\r\ncountries by a community of interest. His plan, to which he attached\r\nmore importance than to Irish reform, though commercial in character,\r\nwas based on a lofty political conception; it was designed to promote\r\n\"the prosperity of the empire at large\".[194] North's concessions to\r\nIreland in 1779 and the subsequent establishment of Irish legislative\r\nindependence left both countries at liberty to regulate each its own\r\ntrade. Ireland admitted English goods free or at low duties; and England\r\nshut out most Irish manufactures, though admitting linen, the\r\nmanufacture of which was encouraged by a bounty, and, for her own\r\nconvenience, woollen yarn free of duty. Ireland, too, though enabled to\r\ntrade directly with the English colonies, could neither send their\r\nproducts to England nor buy them from England. Pitt designed to\r\nestablish perpetual free trade between England and Ireland, and as\r\nIreland would be the gainer by the change, he proposed that in return\r\nshe should contribute a fixed sum to the naval defence of the empire.\r\nRutland, who saw that sending money to England would be violently\r\nopposed, suggested that the contribution should be spent on a portion of\r\nthe navy to be kept on the Irish coasts. In words which it is well to\r\nremember, Pitt pointed out that \"there can be but one navy for the\r\nempire at large, and it must be administered by the executive in this\r\ncountry\".[195] The resolutions he sent over to be presented to the Irish\r\nparliament provided that the contribution should come from the surplus\r\nwhich the grant of free trade would create in the hereditary revenue of\r\nthe crown, for, as that revenue was chiefly made up of customs and\r\nexcise, the payment would be in exact proportion to the benefits\r\nconferred by the change.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S RESOLUTIONS ON IRISH COMMERCE._]\r\n\r\nAs, however, Ireland had a heavy debt, which was largely due to the\r\nextravagance of government, Grattan insisted that the contribution\r\nshould depend on the yearly equalisation of the revenue with the\r\nexpenses. The Irish government yielded to his demand, and with that\r\nchange the resolutions were carried. Pitt brought them before the\r\nEnglish house of commons on February 22 in a speech of remarkable power.\r\nFox, who had long been hoping \"to make his harvest from Ireland,\"[196]\r\nopposed them as injurious to British manufacture. The manufacturers at\r\nonce took the alarm; a petition with 80,000 signatures was sent up from\r\nLancashire against the resolutions, and a \"chamber of manufacturers,\"\r\nwith Wedgwood as president, vigorously protested against them. English\r\nmanufactures, it was asserted, would be undersold and ruined by goods\r\nproduced by cheap labour in Ireland. After evidence had been heard on\r\nthe matter for twelve weeks, Pitt saw that he must modify his scheme. On\r\nMay 12 he brought forward a new set of resolutions less generous to\r\nIreland, and providing that in commercial legislation the Irish\r\nparliament should perpetually be bound by the parliament of Great\r\nBritain. Fox, North, and Sheridan vehemently opposed them, and Fox\r\ndenounced the whole plan as an attempt to lure Ireland to surrender her\r\nliberty. \"I will not,\" said he, \"barter English commerce for Irish\r\nslavery; that is not the price I would pay, nor is this the thing I\r\nwould purchase.\" Nevertheless after long and warm debates, Pitt\r\ntriumphantly carried his resolutions. The speeches of Fox and Sheridan\r\nfound a loud echo in the Irish parliament; Grattan, in an impassioned\r\nspeech, condemned the new resolutions, and they passed the commons only\r\nby 127 to 108. So strong an expression of adverse feeling forced Pitt to\r\nabandon his scheme. Thus was his wise and hopeful attempt to encourage\r\nIrish trade and strengthen the bond between the two countries wrecked by\r\nthe factiousness of the opposition, the selfishness of the manufacturers\r\nin England, and the susceptibility of the Irish liberal party. Fox's\r\nopposition to free trade with Ireland brought him a temporary return of\r\npopularity in the manufacturing districts.\r\n\r\nPitt's command of the house of commons was still uncertain. In February,\r\n1786, he was defeated on a bill for fortifying the dockyards at Plymouth\r\nand Portsmouth. His defeat was largely due to the unpopularity of the\r\nDuke of Richmond, the author of the plan, who had not gained in general\r\nesteem by deserting his former party, and to the old prejudice against\r\nincreasing the military power of the crown. Yet it illustrates Pitt's\r\nposition at the time. It was a \"loose parliament\"; the majority voted\r\nevery man as he had a mind; Pitt had yet to bind his party together, and\r\nhis cold and repellent manners still hindered him from making\r\nfriends.[197] His power was strengthened in this session by the general\r\napproval elicited by his bill for the reduction of the national debt by\r\nmeans of a sinking fund. In forming his plan he received much help from\r\nPrice, a nonconformist minister, distinguished as a writer on financial\r\nquestions. When introducing his bill he was able to show that the public\r\nrevenue would exceed the expenditure by about L900,000, which he\r\nproposed to raise to L1,000,000 by some new taxes not of a burdensome\r\nnature, ample resources existing to meet a temporary excess in naval and\r\nmilitary expenditure caused by the late war. That the revenue would\r\ncontinue to improve seemed assured by the increase in the customs due to\r\nPitt's measures against smuggling. Government might reckon on at least\r\nL1,000,000 surplus, and that sum he proposed to make the foundation of\r\nhis new sinking fund. Unlike the sinking fund established by Sir Robert\r\nWalpole in 1716, which had from time to time been diverted to other\r\npurposes, his fund was to be kept inviolate in war as well as in peace,\r\nand applied solely to the discharge of debt. To secure this, he proposed\r\nthat in every quarter of each succeeding year L250,000 should be paid to\r\nsix commissioners of high position, and should be used by them in the\r\npurchase of stock. The interest of such stock, together with the savings\r\neffected by the expiration of annuities, was to be invested periodically\r\nin the same way. The fund thus created would then accumulate at compound\r\ninterest and become a sinking fund for the extinction of the national\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed both houses without a division. The highest expectations\r\nwere founded upon it, for people generally, in common with Pitt himself\r\nand Price, regarded the new fund as an infallible means of discharging\r\nthe national debt solely by the uninterrupted operation of compound\r\ninterest. That the application of surplus revenue to the payment of debt\r\nis sound finance, and that to treat surpluses designed for that purpose\r\nas a separate fund is a convenient arrangement need no demonstration.\r\nThere is not, however, anything magical or automatic in the operation of\r\ncompound interest, nor can the separation of a sinking fund from general\r\nrevenue have any real efficacy. Reduction of national debt, whatever\r\narrangements may be made for it, can only be effected by taxation.\r\nDuring the years of peace, when the revenue was in excess of\r\nexpenditure, Pitt's sinking fund acted as a convenient mode of reducing\r\nthe debt. In 1792 a second fund of 1 per cent. on all loans was\r\nestablished, and by 1793 the commissioners had reduced the debt by about\r\nL10,000,000. Then came the war with France; the revenue fell short of\r\nthe expenditure, and Pitt met the deficiency by large loans raised at\r\ngreat expense. Yet in order to preserve the benefit which, it was\r\nbelieved, was derived from the uninterrupted operation of compound\r\ninterest, the payments to the sinking fund were regularly continued, so\r\nthat the state was actually borrowing money at a high rate of interest\r\nin order to reduce a debt at a low rate of interest. No member of the\r\nopposition saw the fallacy involved in Pitt's scheme. He is said,\r\nprobably with truth, to have himself discovered it later, but he\r\nmaintained the fund, which was useful as a means of keeping the duty of\r\nreduction of debt before the nation and of helping it to face with\r\nhopefulness the rapid accumulation of debt during the war with France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Pitt laid before parliament a treaty of navigation and commerce\r\nwith France. The treaty of Versailles in 1783 provided that\r\ncommissioners should be appointed to make commercial arrangements\r\nbetween the two countries. The French cabinet invited Shelburne to\r\nproceed in the matter, and he was about to do so when he was driven from\r\noffice. Fox was opposed to a treaty. Pitt appointed a commissioner in\r\nApril, 1784, but nothing further was done. It was a critical matter, for\r\na commercial treaty with France was certain to give some offence at\r\nhome, and Pitt may for that reason alone have been willing to delay\r\naction until his position was more secure. In 1785 the French council of\r\nstate, irritated by the large influx of British manufactures which were\r\nsmuggled into France, issued _arrets_ restraining trade with Great\r\nBritain. Pitt was too wise to retaliate. His opportunity had come, and\r\nhe entrusted the negotiations to Eden, who deserted the opposition and\r\naccepted a seat on the new board of trade. Eden had a thorough knowledge\r\nof commercial affairs, and carried out his mission as envoy to the\r\nFrench court with great success.[198] The treaty, signed on September\r\n26, 1786, reduced the duties on many of the principal articles of\r\ncommerce of both countries, and put others not specified on the\r\nmost-favoured-nation footing. A large and easily accessible market was\r\nopened to British commerce, and, as the exports of France were for the\r\nmost part not produced in England and the French were in want of\r\nBritish products, both countries would, Pitt argued, be gainers by an\r\nincrease in the freedom of their trade one with the other, and political\r\nill-feeling would be diminished by more intimate and mutually profitable\r\nrelations. The navigation clauses showed as liberal a spirit as the\r\ncommercial; an enemy's goods carried in the ships of either country were\r\nto be held free by the other, except contraband of war, which was\r\nlimited to warlike implements and was not to include naval stores.\r\n\r\nThe treaty favoured the interests of the consumer, and was contrary to\r\nthe economic principles of the whigs, who maintained that commerce\r\nshould be regulated so as to promote home industry. Fox strongly\r\nobjected to it in parliament, mainly on the ground that France was \"the\r\nnatural foe of Great Britain,\" and that any close connexion with her was\r\ndangerous. Sheridan and Charles Grey, afterwards the second Earl Grey,\r\nin his maiden speech joined him in condemning the treaty, but it was\r\napproved of by large majorities. Though it caused some temporary\r\ndispleasure among the manufacturers, it was followed by a large increase\r\nof trade with France. Among Pitt's achievements as minister in time of\r\npeace none deserves to be ranked higher than this treaty, whether\r\nregarded in its details, or as a monument of his enlightened commercial\r\npolicy, or as illustrating his statesmanlike view of the relations which\r\nit was desirable to establish between the two countries. His credit was\r\nfurther strengthened in the same session by his bill for the\r\nconsolidation of the customs and excise. The customs duties, fixed from\r\ntime to time, some on one system and some on another, were so complex\r\nthat no one could be sure what he might be required to pay, and\r\nmerchants often depended on the custom-house officers to tell them the\r\namount due on goods. The excise, though in a less confused state, was\r\nalso in urgent need of regulation. Pitt abolished the whole mass of\r\nexisting duties with their percentages and drawbacks, and put a single\r\nduty on each article as nearly as possible of the same amount as before.\r\nThese duties and all other taxes he brought into a consolidated fund on\r\nwhich all public debts were secured. Simple as this change appears, it\r\ninvolved about 3,000 resolutions. While it only slightly increased the\r\nrevenue, it was a great benefit to merchants, it simplified the work in\r\npublic offices, prevented officials from abusing their power, and\r\nenabled Pitt to get rid of a large number of custom-house sinecures,\r\nand so at once to effect an economy and dry up a source of corruption.\r\nThe bill received a warm welcome from Burke, and was passed without a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BILL FOR RELIEF OF DISSENTERS._]\r\n\r\nPitt's position in the commons was not yet one of command. In 1788 his\r\nparty, those who recognised him as their leader, was said to number only\r\n52, while Fox's party, the regular opposition, was estimated at 138; the\r\n\"crown party\" which might be reckoned on to uphold the government for\r\nthe time being \"under any minister not peculiarly unpopular,\" consisted\r\nof 185, and the rest were \"independent\" members, whose votes were\r\nuncertain. Pitt then had to walk warily. His practical temperament was\r\nin his favour. That the country should be well governed, and that it\r\nshould be governed by himself, which was the same thing to him, as it is\r\nprobably to all great ministers, was the object of his life. Compared\r\nwith that, special questions were of small importance. There was nothing\r\ndoctrinaire in his turn of mind; the abstract righteousness of a cause\r\ndid not appeal to him, and could not divert him from the pursuit of his\r\nmain object. In 1787 a bill for the relief of dissenters by the repeal\r\nof the test and corporation acts of the reign of Charles II. was brought\r\nin by Beaufoy, a supporter of the government. In reality the dissenters\r\nsuffered very little from these acts, for they were relieved by annual\r\nacts of indemnity. Yet their grievance was not wholly sentimental, and,\r\neven had it been so, it would still have been a grievance. The\r\nopposition was divided; North opposed the bill, Fox warmly advocated it.\r\nPitt consulted the bishops. All save two were against it. He valued the\r\nsupport of the Church, and declared himself against the bill, which was\r\nrejected by a majority of 78. In 1789 the majority against it sank to\r\n22. Yet Pitt was thoroughly high-principled. As we shall see later in\r\nthe case of Hastings, he would not be false to his convictions, and if\r\nhe judged that a cause was worth maintaining, even at the cost of\r\nweakening his own position, he did not shrink from his duty. This is\r\nproved by his conduct with reference to the slave trade.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties attendant on the trade were forcibly represented by a\r\nsociety for procuring its abolition, founded in 1787, mainly by quakers,\r\nof which Granville Sharp and Clarkson were prominent members.\r\nWilberforce's sympathy was already aroused by reports of the sufferings\r\nof the negroes in the slave-ships. Pitt advised him to undertake the\r\nquestion in parliament, and as a preliminary agreed to the appointment\r\nof a committee to inquire into the methods of the trade. The merchants\r\nof London, Lancashire, and Bristol were indignant at the threatened\r\ninterference, and efforts were made to conceal the truth. Nevertheless\r\nthe abominable cruelties to which the slaves were subjected during the\r\nmiddle passage were clearly proved. Chained to their places, fettered\r\nand fastened together, they were packed so closely on the lower decks\r\nand in stifling holds that they could scarcely turn, they were kept\r\nshort of food and water, and were exercised to keep them alive by being\r\nforced under pain of the lash to jump in their fetters. While\r\nWilberforce was ill in 1788, Pitt gave notice of a motion on the trade,\r\nand supported a bill moved by Sir William Dolben which mitigated the\r\nsufferings of the negroes during the passage. In 1789 Wilberforce in a\r\nlong and eloquent speech moved resolutions for the abolition of the\r\ntrade, and Pitt, Fox, who was always quick to feel for human suffering,\r\nand Burke joined in supporting him. Pitt's conduct on this question\r\ndispleased many of his followers. The interests concerned in the trade\r\nwere powerful, and for a time the question was virtually shelved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AUSTRIA AND THE UNITED PROVINCES._]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Versailles left England isolated. The new government was to\r\nshow that she was able and ready to reassert her right to exercise an\r\ninfluence in Europe. The political situation presented three alliances,\r\nof France and Austria, Austria and Russia, France and Spain, and opposed\r\nto them two isolated powers, England and Prussia. None of these\r\nalliances directly threatened England, yet there were elements of danger\r\nin the two first. After the death of Maria Theresa, in 1780, her son\r\nJoseph II. changed the general direction of Austria's policy. He was\r\nrestless and full of great schemes which he looked to Russia rather than\r\nFrance to support. The growth of Russian power under Catherine had\r\nchanged the political state of Europe. The treaty of Kutchuk Kainardji,\r\nin 1774, at the close of a successful war against the Turks, saw Russia\r\nstrongly established on the Black Sea; the partition of Poland augmented\r\nher preponderance in the north: and in 1780 England found that her\r\nmaritime interests were threatened by a power seated both on the Baltic\r\nand close to the Mediterranean. Catherine welcomed the overtures of\r\nJoseph, for she contemplated further conquests from the Turks, and the\r\ngood-will of Austria was important to her. Of these two allied powers\r\nAustria was the more dangerous to England and Prussia. Russia had\r\nalready gained much, Austria was hoping for gain; Catherine was looking\r\nmainly to extension in eastern, Joseph's ambitions tended to disturb the\r\nbalance of power in western and central Europe. France was impoverished;\r\nshe desired peace and was anxious to restrain the emperor's ambition,\r\nand Spain could do nothing without her. A quadruple alliance, then,\r\nbetween the two imperial courts and France and Spain was impossible. The\r\nlate war had raised the Bourbon influence in Europe. England was unable\r\nto detach Austria from France, and to form an alliance, as Carmarthen\r\nwished, with the two imperial courts; and she was, as we shall see, led\r\nby a conflict in Holland to enter into an agreement with Prussia which\r\nhad important results.\r\n\r\nHer foreign policy between 1784 and 1788 was chiefly concerned with the\r\naffairs of the United Provinces. Anxious to remove the restrictions\r\nimposed by treaties on the Austrian Netherlands, Joseph set aside the\r\nBarrier treaty of 1715, designed to check French aggression; and the\r\nDutch withdrew their garrisons from the border fortresses. He pressed\r\nother claims upon them, relying on their weakness, for they paid dearly\r\nfor provoking a war with England; and he demanded that the Scheldt,\r\nwhich was closed by the treaty of 1648, should be open to navigation.\r\nHis claim concerned England, for though Austria could never become a\r\ngreat naval power even if Antwerp had access to the sea, the ports of\r\nthe Netherlands and, indeed, of the United Provinces might fall under\r\nthe control of some strong maritime state, such as France or Russia.\r\nJoseph's demand was backed by a recommendation from the Russian empress.\r\nHe sent ships to sail up and down the river, and they were forcibly\r\nstopped by the Dutch. War seemed imminent. France, however, was then\r\ngaining great influence in Holland, and though she compelled the Dutch\r\nto assent to some of the emperor's demands, she upheld their refusal\r\nwith regard to the Scheldt, and negotiated a treaty concluded at\r\nFontainebleau in November, 1785, between the emperor and the republic,\r\nby which Joseph renounced his demand for the opening of the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FRENCH INFLUENCE IN HOLLAND._]\r\n\r\nHe was already occupied in renewing a scheme, which had been defeated in\r\n1778, for exchanging his Netherland provinces for Bavaria. This project\r\nwas highly prejudicial to Prussian interests in Germany; and Frederick\r\nof Prussia baulked it by forming a Furstenbund, or alliance of princes,\r\nto maintain the integrity of the Germanic constitution. In February,\r\n1785, he invited King George as Elector of Hanover to join in this\r\nprojected alliance. George willingly assented, for the alliance was\r\nbeneficial to Hanover; and in a letter to his Hanoverian minister he\r\nexpressed the hope that his assent would lead to an understanding\r\nbetween England and Prussia. This was merely an expression of his\r\nprivate feelings; the Furstenbund was not a matter of English politics\r\nand did not, in fact, bring about an Anglo-Prussian alliance.[199] Such\r\nan alliance was highly desirable for England as a means of defeating the\r\nintrigues of France in the United Provinces. The more republican or\r\n\"patriot\" party in Holland, which had led the states to break their\r\nancient friendly relations with England, was completely under French\r\ninfluence, and, relying on the support of France, designed to compel the\r\nstadholder, William V. of Orange, a feeble and irresolute prince, to\r\nresign his office. Their victory would have made the republic virtually\r\na French province, and would have brought France a great accession of\r\nnaval power. Sir James Harris, the British ambassador at the Hague,\r\nlaboured to counteract their designs by encouraging the party in the\r\nrepublic opposed to the policy of Holland. The stadholder's wife, a\r\nprincess of high spirit, was a niece of Frederick the Great, and Harris\r\nwas anxious for an alliance between England and Prussia as a means of\r\noverthrowing the French party. Ewart, the ambassador at Berlin, shared\r\nhis views, but the ambassadors were held back by Carmarthen. The\r\ncabinet, Harris declared, was wholly occupied by domestic matters.[200]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1785, it was evident that Austria was in accord with France, and\r\nthe cabinet inquired what Frederick's intentions were, hoping that his\r\ndesire that England would join in preventing the Bavarian exchange would\r\ninduce him to oppose the ambitious designs of France, and to form a\r\nunion of defence.[201] Frederick spoke freely to Ewart with reference\r\nto the Bavarian exchange, but would promise nothing as regards\r\nHolland.[202] The cabinet then made proposals to Catherine on the basis\r\nof her detaching Austria from France, and the formation of a triple\r\nalliance between England and the two imperial courts for the maintenance\r\nof peace.[203] Catherine replied that she would only agree on condition\r\nthat England would not assent to the Furstenbund, which was a menace to\r\nher Austrian ally. Her demand was peremptory and threatening. George\r\nstood firm. The Furstenbund, he wrote to Pitt, concerned his \"electoral\r\ncapacity,\" it was a matter of Hanoverian, not of English, politics; he\r\nhad already ratified it, and would not retreat.[204] A communication\r\nfrom the Prussian ambassador led the cabinet in September to send Lord\r\nCornwallis to Frederick to ascertain his intentions. Frederick declared\r\nthat the agreement between himself and England to check France would\r\nmean a general war in which England would have to meet the fleets of\r\nFrance, Spain, Holland, and perhaps Russia; and he would have on his\r\nhands the armies of France, Austria, and Russia; and that \"though such a\r\ncontest had been maintained, it was not a game to play often\".[205] He\r\nwas old and ill, and would not interfere. The action of France in\r\nnegotiating the treaty of Fontainebleau strengthened the French party in\r\nHolland; the stadholder was forced to quit the Hague, but was supported\r\nby some of the other provinces. Frederick the Great died on August 17,\r\n1786. The fortunes of the Orange party were at low ebb. France supplied\r\nthe patriots with money; free corps were acting on their side; the\r\nstadholder was suspended from his office, and French agents advocated\r\nits abolition. It seemed as though Holland would become mistress of the\r\nDutch republic and France the ruler of Holland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE._]\r\n\r\nThe new Prussian king, Frederick William II., the brother of the\r\nPrincess of Orange, deserted the purely German policy of Frederick for\r\na more extended European policy. He did not, however, at once interfere\r\nin the affairs of Holland, for there was a strong French party at his\r\ncourt. Harris needed money to support the stadholder's cause, and\r\nCarmarthen proposed a subvention of L1,200 a year. George was anxious\r\nnot to be drawn into another war, and said that as his family was\r\ngrowing expensive the money could not be spared from the civil\r\nlist.[206] In May, 1787, the cabinet decided to put L20,000 at Harris's\r\ndisposal. Matters came to a crisis in June. As the princess was on her\r\nway to the Hague she was arrested and turned back by a free corps.\r\nFrederick William demanded that satisfaction should be made for this\r\ninsult, and as the states of Holland, relying on French support, refused\r\nhis demand, he entered into a secret convention with England to restore\r\nthe stadholder, the two powers agreeing, Prussia to send an army into\r\nHolland and England to prepare forty ships of the line to support it. A\r\nPrussian army under the Duke of Brunswick crossed the frontier and met\r\nwith little resistance. Amsterdam surrendered on October 10, and the\r\nstadholder was restored. Meanwhile Montmorin, the French foreign\r\nminister, declared that his court would support the Dutch. Pitt, who was\r\nthen personally directing foreign affairs, decided, with the full\r\napproval of the king, that if the French court would not agree to the\r\nrestoration war was inevitable.[207] A treaty was made with the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse Cassel for the hire of troops, and the naval and\r\nmilitary forces were augmented. On the 27th France definitely renounced\r\nher design of intervention, and on Pitt's demand the French navy was\r\nreduced to a peace-footing. The designs of France, which were fraught\r\nwith danger to English interests, were defeated, and the party in\r\nHolland favourable to alliance with England was secured in power. Though\r\nthe Furstenbund, a purely German system directed against Austrian\r\nambition, failed to bring about an Anglo-Prussian alliance, the change\r\nin Prussian policy and, as an immediate cause, the insult to the\r\nPrussian king's sister, brought England and Prussia into active\r\nco-operation against the attempt of France to become mistress of the\r\nUnited Provinces, and in 1788 led to the formation of a triple alliance\r\nfor mutual defence and the maintenance of peace between England,\r\nPrussia, and the republic which changed the political situation. England\r\nwas no longer isolated; she was restored to her position of influence in\r\nthe affairs of Europe. Harris was created Baron Malmesbury as a reward\r\nfor his services at the Hague.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[186] George III. to Pitt, March 30, 1790, MS.

Annoyed by\r\nreproofs sent out by the directors, and harassed by opposition in his\r\ncouncil, by the independent attitude of the Madras government, and by\r\ndifficulties arising from the conduct of officials both at Benares and\r\nLucknow, Hastings in 1783 declared his intention of resigning office.\r\nHis hope that the cabinet would request him to remain with extended\r\npowers was crushed by the speech with which Pitt introduced his India\r\nbill, and he left India in February, 1785, esteemed and honoured by the\r\nnatives of all classes in the Bengal government. His wife came to\r\nEngland a year earlier, and though her conduct before her marriage with\r\nHastings would have debarred other ladies from appearing at so strictly\r\nmoral a court, she was received at St. James's, and the queen accepted\r\npresents from her. On the return of Hastings the directors thanked him\r\nfor his eminent services, the king was gracious to him, the chancellor,\r\nThurlow, who was in the royal confidence, was loud in his praise, and\r\nsociety generally smiled upon him. Pitt was cold; there was much in his\r\nconduct which needed defence. Preparations for an attack upon him were\r\nsteadily pursued. Burke found a useful ally in Francis, who gratified\r\nhis spite by giving him information to be used against his former\r\nantagonist. Fox and the opposition as a party adopted Burke's case. It\r\nwas believed that Pitt would stand by Hastings in order to please the\r\nking. If he did so, they could represent him as shielding a criminal; if\r\nhe joined in bringing him to trial, he would incur the risk of offending\r\nthe king and alienating many of the supporters of the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHARGES AGAINST HASTINGS._]\r\n\r\nDuring 1785 Burke went on accumulating facts which were distorted by his\r\nfervent imagination. The delay of the attack encouraged the friends of\r\nHastings, and on the first day of the session of 1786 his parliamentary\r\nagent, Major Scott, an ill-advised person, challenged Burke to fulfil a\r\npledge made the year before that he would bring charges against him. In\r\nFebruary Burke announced that he would propose to impeach Hastings\r\nbefore the lords, and in April exhibited charges against him. Pitt\r\ninsisted that a copy of them should be delivered to Hastings, and that\r\nhe should be heard in his defence before the house voted upon them. Fox\r\nand Burke, who on every check to their proceedings accused the\r\ngovernment of a design to screen Hastings, declared with much heat that\r\nPitt's proposal was intended to quash the accusation. The house,\r\nhowever, determined to hear Hastings, and he read his defence, which\r\noccupied two days and wearied his audience with a number of unfamiliar\r\ndetails. On June 1 Burke moved the first charge, which related to the\r\nRohilla war, and was ably supported by Fox. Pitt took no part in\r\ndiscussing the main subject of the debate. Dundas, the most prominent\r\nmember of the India board, though condemning Hastings's conduct, refused\r\nto consider the war as affording ground for a criminal charge; and said\r\nthat, as an act of parliament had subsequently reappointed Hastings as\r\ngovernor-general, the house had condoned his previous conduct; and he\r\nspoke of Hastings as \"the saviour of India\". The house rejected the\r\ncharge by 119 to 67.\r\n\r\nThe second charge, with reference to the treatment of the raja of\r\nBenares, was moved by Fox with all his wonted ability. A treasury note\r\ninvited the supporters of the government to vote against the motion. To\r\nthe astonishment of all, and to the consternation of his supporters,\r\nPitt announced that he agreed to the charge; he sharply criticised the\r\nmisrepresentation of Hastings's opponents, and conclusively maintained\r\nthat the raja was bound to furnish the troops and money demanded of him,\r\nbut he considered the fine imposed on him \"exorbitant, unjust, and\r\ntyrannical\". Many of the government party voted against him, but about\r\nfifty followed his lead and the charge was accepted by 119 to 79. The\r\nnext day Hastings attended the court on the presentation of a\r\nmagnificent diamond sent by the nizam to the king, whose acceptance of\r\nthe present gave rise to much ill-natured comment. Various motives have\r\nbeen suggested for Pitt's decision. None appear adequate save the most\r\nobvious and honourable one, that he acted in accordance with his\r\nconscience. Though his decision took the house by surprise, he clearly\r\ndefined his attitude four months before: \"he was neither a determined\r\nfriend or foe to Mr. Hastings, and was resolved to support the\r\nprinciples of justice and equity\".[208] He did not read the papers\r\nrelating to Benares until the eve of the debate, and then, Dundas says,\r\nafter reading them along with Hastings's defence, Pitt and he agreed\r\nthat they could not resist the charge. The king in a friendly note gave\r\nPitt credit for acting conscientiously, adding that for his part he did\r\nnot think it possible in India \"to carry on publick business with the\r\nsame moderation that is suitable to an European civilized nation\".[209]\r\nGeorge was an eminently sensible man. There was no split between him and\r\nhis minister.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1787, Sheridan brought forward the third charge, relating\r\nto the treatment of the begams of Oudh in a speech held by all who heard\r\nit to be a marvellous display of oratory. He described Hastings as \"by\r\nturns a Dionysius and a Scapin,\" a tyrant and a trickster, with a mind\r\nin which \"all was shuffling, ambiguous, dark, insidious, and\r\nlittle\".[210] Indeed throughout the proceedings against Hastings his\r\naccusers constantly disregarded moderation and even decency of language.\r\nThe third charge and other articles having been accepted by the commons,\r\nBurke, on May 11, impeached Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanours.\r\nAn attempt was also made to bring an impeachment against Sir Elijah\r\nImpey, lately chief-justice of Bengal, on the ground of the execution of\r\nNanda-Kumar and on other charges, but the commons, having heard his\r\ndefence, refused to agree to the articles. The trial of Warren Hastings\r\nbefore the lords was opened in Westminster hall on February 13, 1788,\r\nwith circumstances of dignity and splendour worthy of so great an\r\noccasion. Burke's speech on the case for the prosecution lasted for four\r\ndays; it remains a magnificent specimen of rhetoric, though its vehement\r\ndenunciations founded on occurrences in which the accused was not\r\ndirectly concerned, and its attempts to create prejudice were not likely\r\nto affect the opinions of men conscious of their responsibility as\r\njudges. The court sat during that session of parliament for thirty-five,\r\nand in 1789 for seventeen days. It became evident that the trial would\r\nlast a long time and public interest in it soon flagged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CORNWALLIS GOVERNOR-GENERAL._]\r\n\r\nCornwallis was chosen by Pitt in 1786 as governor-general of India under\r\nthe new act, and assumed the government in 1788. Unfettered by his\r\ncouncil, he was in a far better position than Hastings, and, in spite of\r\nmany difficulties arising from abuses of long standing, he effected\r\nnumerous reforms both in the civil and military services of the company\r\nduring the first three years of his administration. Meanwhile Tipu,\r\nencouraged by his success in the late war and by the negligence of the\r\nMadras government, was preparing for another attempt to drive the\r\nEnglish out of the Karnatic. He attacked their ally, the raja of\r\nTravancore, in 1789. Cornwallis secured the alliance of the nizam and\r\nthe Marathas in 1790, and General Medows, the new governor of Madras,\r\nsuccessfully invaded Mysore. As, however, no further progress was made,\r\nCornwallis assumed the command; he carried Bangalore by storm in March,\r\n1791, and having obtained the active co-operation of the nizam and the\r\nMarathas, laid siege to Seringapatam in 1792, and compelled Tipu to\r\nsubmit to a peace by which he surrendered half his dominions, engaged to\r\npay a sum equal to L3,600,000, and gave two of his sons as hostages. The\r\nsurrendered territory was divided between the peishwa and the nizam.\r\nTipu's power was effectually broken, and the way was prepared for his\r\nfinal overthrow seven years later. Cornwallis was created a marquis as a\r\nreward for his splendid services, and resigned his office in 1793.\r\n\r\nThough the government escaped the dangers in which the impeachment of\r\nHastings threatened to involve it, a new question relating to India\r\nbrought it into some peril. When, in October, 1787, war seemed likely to\r\narise out of the intervention of England in the affairs of the Dutch\r\nrepublic, the India board sent four regiments to India, a measure of\r\nprecaution which met with the full approval of the directors. The\r\nstorm-clouds dispersed, and then the directors objected to pay the\r\nexpense. Pitt held that the company was bound by the act of 1784 to pay\r\nfor the transport and maintenance of any troops which the board judged\r\nto be necessary for the defence of the British possessions in India, and\r\nbrought in a declaratory bill to that effect in February, 1788. The\r\nopposition was supported by the influence of the company, and made a\r\nvigorous resistance. Fox, whose downfall as minister had followed his\r\nattack on the company, appeared as a champion of its claims. The\r\ndirectors were heard by their counsel, one of whom, Erskine, afterwards\r\nlord chancellor, a strong whig, made a violent attack on Pitt. On the\r\nother side, Scott, also (as Lord Eldon) a future chancellor, contended\r\nas a member of the house that the bill was a true exposition of the act.\r\nThe debate on the committal lasted till 7 A.M. Pitt had drunk heavily\r\nwith Dundas the night before, and was too unwell towards the end of the\r\ndebate to reply to his opponents. His majority of 57 was considered\r\nunsatisfactory, and so many of the regular supporters of government were\r\nadverse or lukewarm that an ultimate defeat was thought probable. With\r\ngreat tact he two days later adopted some amendments which met the chief\r\narguments of the opposition without injuring the principle of the\r\nbill.[211] The danger was over, and the bill finally passed both houses.\r\nA severer conflict and a more signal triumph were at hand.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the aged chief-justice, Lord Mansfield, in the June of\r\nthat year, was followed by some legal appointments, which included those\r\nof Pitt's personal friend, Pepper Arden, as master of the rolls, and\r\nScott as solicitor-general. Thurlow, who was annoyed by Pitt's assent to\r\nthe impeachment of Hastings, strongly objected to Arden's appointment.\r\nThe king tried to make peace between him and Pitt. Thurlow was forced to\r\nyield, and remained sulky and hostile. About the same time Howe, the\r\nfirst lord of the admiralty, who was constantly attacked with reference\r\nto matters which arose out of the reduction of the navy consequent on\r\nthe peace, resigned office, because he considered that Pitt did not\r\nafford him adequate support. He was created an English earl on his\r\nretirement. In his place Pitt put his own elder brother Chatham, a\r\nfavourite with the king, but, as it proved, an indolent and inefficient\r\nminister, and also appointed Hood to a seat on the new admiralty board.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AFFAIRS OF THE PRINCE OF WALES._]\r\n\r\nFor the most part things were going well with the king. He rejoiced in\r\nthe successes of his ministers, and his victory over the coalition\r\nbrought him popularity such as he had not enjoyed since his accession.\r\nHis popularity was heightened by an attempt to stab him made by an\r\ninsane woman named Margaret Nicholson on August 2, 1786. The poor woman\r\nwas sent to Bedlam. George, who behaved with the utmost calmness,\r\nescaped unhurt, and the manifestations of loyalty evoked by the incident\r\ndeeply gratified him. He was, however, much troubled by the ill conduct\r\nof the Prince of Wales. The prince drank, gambled, betted, and was\r\naddicted to debauchery; he showed no sense of honour in his dealings\r\neither with men or women, was thoroughly mean and selfish, and consorted\r\nwith low companions. He was outrageously extravagant, and, in addition\r\nto the large sums lavished on his ordinary expenses, incurred enormous\r\nliabilities in altering and decorating his residence, Carlton house. The\r\narrangement of his affairs in 1783 was not on a scale sufficient to meet\r\nhis expenditure. By August, 1784, he was so deeply in debt that he\r\ninformed his father that he intended to leave England and live abroad.\r\nGeorge insisted that he should give up this scheme, which would have\r\nimplied a public breach, and said that if he expected help he should\r\nsend him a full statement of his debts and some assurance that he would\r\nkeep within his income in the future. The prince was unwilling to send\r\ndetails of his debts, and when Sir James Harris tried to persuade him to\r\nplease his father by ceasing to identify himself with the opposition and\r\nby marrying, declared that he could not give up \"Charles\" [Fox] and his\r\nother friends, and that he would never marry. When at last he sent his\r\nfather the required statement, it showed liabilities amounting to\r\nL269,000, of which L79,700 was for completing the work at Carlton house.\r\nGeorge was very angry, and the prince finding that his father would not\r\nhelp him stopped the work, dismissed his court officers, and sold his\r\nstud. There was an open quarrel between the father and son. \"The king\r\nhates me,\" the prince said, and he did not consider how grievously he\r\nhad provoked his father.[212]\r\n\r\nHis friends wished to obtain the payment of his debts from parliament,\r\nbut were embarrassed by the report that he was secretly married to Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert, a beautiful and virtuous lady, six years older than\r\nhimself, who at twenty-seven was left a widow for the second time. After\r\nrepeated solicitations, unmanly exhibitions of despair, and a pretended\r\nattempt at suicide, he had persuaded her to accept his offer of\r\nmarriage, and they were married privately before witnesses by a\r\nclergyman of the established Church on December 21, 1785. This was a\r\nmost serious matter, for Mrs. Fitzherbert was a Roman catholic, and the\r\nact of settlement provided that marriage with a papist constituted an\r\nincapacity to inherit the crown, while on the other hand the royal\r\nmarriage act of 1772 rendered the prince's marriage invalid. In April,\r\n1787, his friends in the house of commons took steps towards seeking the\r\npayment of his debts from the house. Pitt refused to move in the matter\r\nwithout the king's commands, and, notice of a motion for an address to\r\nthe crown on the subject having been given, declared that he would meet\r\nit with \"an absolute negative\". In the course of debate, Rolle, a member\r\nfor Devonshire, alluded to the reported marriage as a matter of danger\r\nto the Church and state. Fox explicitly denied the truth of the report,\r\nand on being pressed declared that he spoke from \"direct authority\".\r\nThere is no doubt that he did so, and that the prince lied. Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert was cruelly wounded, and in order to satisfy her the prince\r\nasked Grey to say something in the house which would convey the\r\nimpression that Fox had gone too far. Grey peremptorily refused to throw\r\na doubt on Fox's veracity, and the prince had to employ a meaner\r\ninstrument: \"Sheridan must say something\". Accordingly, Sheridan in a\r\nspeech in the house, while not insinuating that Fox had spoken without\r\nthe prince's authority, \"uttered some unintelligible sentimental trash\r\nabout female delicacy\".[213] Fox was indignant at the way in which the\r\nprince had treated him, and is said to have refused to speak to him for\r\nmore than a year; but he evidently did not consider the prince's conduct\r\nsuch as ought to prevent him from again acting with him, and in about a\r\nyear they appear to have been as friendly as before.\r\n\r\nThe denial of the prince's marriage was generally accepted. Pitt saw\r\nthat there was a strong feeling that he ought to be relieved from his\r\ndifficulties, and determined to anticipate a motion to that effect. He\r\nand Dundas arranged terms between the father and son. George agreed that\r\nthe prince should receive an addition to his income of L10,000 a year\r\nfrom the civil list, and that a royal message should be sent to the\r\ncommons requesting the payment of his debts; and he demanded that the\r\nprince should promise not to get into debt again. The promise was given,\r\nand a reference to it was inserted in the king's message. The commons,\r\nwithout a division, voted L161,000 for the payment of the debts and\r\nL20,000 for the completion of Carlton house. The father and son were\r\nreconciled, and appeared together in public. In spite of his\r\nprotestations the prince did not amend his conduct. Early in 1788 he\r\nstill took an active part with the opposition, and set up a gambling\r\nclub, where he lost heavily. His example was followed by his younger\r\nbrother Frederick, Duke of York. The duke, then a lieutenant-general,\r\nafter receiving a military education in Germany, returned home in 1787,\r\nand lived a very fast life with so little regard to decency that \"his\r\ncompany was thought _mauvais ton_\".[214]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE KING'S INSANITY._]\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1788, the king, who for some time had been in bad health,\r\nbecame decidedly insane. At first it was believed that his life was in\r\nimmediate danger, and that, even if he was spared, he would not recover\r\nhis reason. The Prince of Wales stayed at Windsor, and assumed charge of\r\nthe king's person, and it was universally recognised that he must be\r\nregent. Whether the king died or remained insane, Pitt's dismissal\r\nseemed certain, for not only was the prince closely allied with the\r\nopposition, but he was deeply offended at the line Pitt had taken with\r\nreference to his debts. The hopes of the opposition ran high. Fox, who\r\nwas travelling in Italy with his mistress, Mrs. Armistead, was sent for\r\nin hot haste. In his absence Sheridan, whose convivial habits made him\r\nacceptable to the prince, busied himself with the affairs of the party.\r\nIf they came into power Loughborough had an undoubted claim to the\r\nchancellorship. Thurlow, however, was ready to betray his colleagues if\r\nhe were assured that he should retain his office. The prince and\r\nSheridan arranged that he should have his price, and he secretly joined\r\nthem. From the first Pitt decided on his course; the prince must be\r\nappointed regent by act of parliament, with such limitations as would\r\nsecure the king, should he recover, from being hampered in the exercise\r\nof his rights.[215] For himself, embarrassed as his private affairs\r\nwere, he looked forward calmly to the loss of office, and determined to\r\npractise as a barrister. According to the last prorogation, parliament\r\nwas to meet on the 20th. The king's insanity rendered a further\r\nprorogation impossible; parliament met, and Pitt procured an adjournment\r\nuntil December 4, to see how it would go with the king.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fox returned home and unwillingly agreed to the arrangement\r\nwith Thurlow. The chancellor's colleagues were convinced that he\r\nbetrayed their counsels, and one day when the cabinet met at Windsor,\r\nthe fact that he had first had a private interview with the prince was\r\ndisclosed through the loss of his hat; \"I suppose,\" he growled, \"I left\r\nit in the other place,\" the prince's apartment.[216] Pitt wisely took no\r\nnotice of his treachery. On the 3rd the king's physicians were examined\r\nby the privy council; they stated that he was mentally incapable, that\r\nthey believed that his illness was curable, and that they could not say\r\nhow long it might continue. The opposition was anxious to make the worst\r\nof matters, for if the illness was likely to be a long one, it would be\r\ndifficult to refuse the regent full powers. Accordingly, on the 4th, Fox\r\nurged that the physicians should be examined by a committee of the\r\nhouse. Pitt assented readily, for a new physician had been called in who\r\ntook a favourable view of the case. This was Willis, a clergyman, who\r\nhad become a doctor, and was a specialist in insanity; he took chief\r\ncharge of the king, who was removed to Kew, pursued a new line of\r\ntreatment, prohibited irritating restraints, and controlled him by\r\nestablishing influence over him. He told the committee that he had found\r\nthat such cases lasted on an average five months, and at worst about\r\neighteen; the other doctors, though less hopeful, held that ultimate\r\nrecovery was probable. The ministers were ready to proceed, and\r\nreckoned that another month would see the prince appointed regent, and\r\nthat their own dismissal would follow at once.[217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOX ASSERTS THE PRINCE'S RIGHT._]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th Pitt moved for a committee to search for precedents. Fox\r\nobjected; it was not for parliament, he maintained, to consider who\r\nshould be regent; the Prince of Wales had a clear right to the regency,\r\nand parliament was only qualified to decide when he should exercise his\r\nright. When Pitt heard the authority of parliament thus called in\r\nquestion, he is said to have slapped his leg and to have exultantly\r\nexclaimed to the minister sitting beside him, \"I'll unwhig the gentleman\r\nfor the rest of his life!\" He declared that Fox's doctrine was in the\r\nhighest degree unconstitutional, and that no part of the royal authority\r\ncould belong to the prince unless it was conferred on him by parliament;\r\nthe question, he told the house, concerned its right of deliberation.\r\nFox saw his mistake, and two days later stated that the prince put\r\nforward no claim of right; both sides agreed that he must be regent and\r\nthat before he assumed the office he must be invited to do so by\r\nparliament; his right was an abstract question upon which it was no use\r\nto argue. Pitt was too good a tactician to allow him to minimise the\r\npoint at issue; he denied \"that the prince had any right whatever\". The\r\ndifference between an irresistible claim, which Pitt acknowledged, and\r\nan inherent right was not one merely of words; if the prince could claim\r\nthe regency as of right, parliament could not restrict his power without\r\nhis consent. The effect of Fox's false move was heightened by the folly\r\nof Sheridan who raised a storm of indignation by a threat of the danger\r\nof provoking the prince to assert his claim. Once again Fox made Pitt\r\nthe champion of the king and the nation against the pretensions of a\r\nwhig faction. The character of the struggle was understood, and bills\r\nwere posted with the heading: \"Fox for the prince's prerogative,\" and\r\n\"Pitt for the privilege of parliament and the liberties of the nation\".\r\nYet in both houses several supporters of the government ratted, for the\r\nprince seemed the rising sun, and he and the Duke of York openly\r\ncanvassed on Fox's side.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the commons approved Pitt's resolutions to the effect that,\r\nas the personal exercise of the royal authority was interrupted, it was\r\nthe duty of the two houses to supply the defect, and that it was\r\nnecessary to determine on means by which the royal assent might be given\r\nto bills for that purpose. None of the precedents adduced by the\r\ncommittee met the present case. Fox argued that to appoint a regent by a\r\nlaw was to treat the monarchy as elective, and that the two houses had\r\nno legislative power independently of the crown; and assuming that he\r\nwas about to re-enter on office taunted the ministers with a design to\r\nweaken their successors by limiting the powers of the regent. The\r\nministerial majority was 268 to 204. Pitt proposed to provide for the\r\nroyal assent by placing the great seal in a commission with authority to\r\naffix it to the bill. This daring fiction, the only means by which a\r\nregency could be established by enactment, was approved by 251 to 178.\r\nOn this question, and throughout the whole course of the struggle, Burke\r\nspoke with a violence and impropriety which injured his party and\r\nsuggested a disordered mind. He called Pitt the prince's competitor,\r\nreferred to the chancellor as Priapus and as \"a man with a large black\r\nbrow and a big wig,\" and later disgusted the house by speaking of the\r\nking as \"hurled from his throne\" by the Almighty. In the lords the\r\nproceedings followed the same lines as in the commons. Willis's account\r\nof the king convinced Thurlow that he was playing a wrong game, and when\r\nthe question of the prince's right was discussed in the lords' he spoke\r\nstrongly on the government side. Several members of the lower house were\r\npresent to hear him. He referred to the favours he had received from the\r\nking, \"When I forget them,\" he said, \"may God forget me!\" \"Forget you!\"\r\nsaid Wilkes with exquisite wit, \"He will see you damned first.\" \"The\r\nbest thing that can happen to you,\" said Burke. Pitt left the house\r\nexclaiming, \"Oh, the rascal!\" On the 25th Thurlow formally severed his\r\nconnexion with Fox. After a warm debate the ministerial resolutions were\r\naffirmed by the lords by 99 to 66.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESTRICTIONS ON THE REGENT'S POWER._]\r\n\r\nThe restrictions which the cabinet proposed to place on the power of the\r\nregent were laid before the prince. He was to be debarred from\r\nconferring peerages except on the king's issue of full age; from\r\ngranting reversions or any office or pension except during pleasure, and\r\nfrom disposing of the king's property; and the charge of the king's\r\nperson and the management of the household were to be in the queen's\r\nhands. These restrictions were based on the idea that the king would\r\nspeedily recover; if his illness was prolonged they were to be open to\r\nrevision by parliament. The prince promised to accept the regency, and\r\nstated his objections to the restrictions. The existence of the\r\ngovernment seemed drawing to an end. Pitt was extremely popular, and the\r\nLondon merchants, expecting that he would soon be driven from office,\r\noffered him a gift of L100,000, which he declined to accept. Before he\r\ncould bring the restrictions before the commons, the speaker, Cornwall,\r\ndied, and on January 5, 1789, William Wyndham Grenville, joint-paymaster\r\nof the forces, was elected in his place. A fresh examination of the\r\nphysicians was urged by the opposition. Willis told the committee that\r\ngood progress was made; Dr. Warren's account was less favourable. Willis\r\nwas represented by the prince's party as a charlatan, and Warren was\r\npitted against him as the doctor of the opposition. After this delay\r\nPitt laid the restrictions before the house as resolutions. They\r\ncertainly impaired the power of the executive, and would have weakened\r\nany ministry appointed by the regent. No exact date was fixed for their\r\nduration, and it is conceivable that, after the regency had lasted for\r\nsome years, the upper house would have refused to remove the restriction\r\nas to the creation of peers, and would, as in 1719, have attempted to\r\nlimit their number by withholding from the regent a part of the royal\r\nprerogative. And as the management of the household would have placed a\r\npatronage of over L80,000 a year[218] at the disposal of the queen, who\r\nwas hostile to Fox, a court influence might have been established in\r\nfavour of Pitt and adverse to the new ministry. The queen was accused of\r\nintrigue and violently attacked by the opposition press. Fox urged his\r\nobjections to the resolutions with much force, but they were adopted by\r\nboth houses, and on the 31st the prince accepted the offer of the\r\nregency made by the lords and commons on those terms, on the\r\nunderstanding that the restrictions were temporary.\r\n\r\nHis party was in high glee; medals were struck to commemorate his\r\nregency, whig ladies wore regency caps and ribbons, and a list of new\r\nministers was drawn up. The conduct of the prince and the Duke of York\r\ncaused much scandal. Stories of the ill-treatment of the king while in\r\nthe prince's charge may be dismissed as unfounded; it is alleged that\r\nthe prince made sport of his father's ravings, it is certain that his\r\nassociates did so, and that he and his brother behaved with brutal\r\ncallousness and openly indulged in riotous merry-making during the\r\nking's illness.[219] Before the resolutions could be made law it was\r\nthought that a formal opening of parliament was necessary in order to\r\ninvest it with legislative capacity, and this was effected on February 3\r\nby a commission under the great seal. Pitt then brought in the regency\r\nbill, and while it was before the commons, agreed that all restriction\r\nshould terminate in three years if the king remained ill so long. The\r\nbill passed the commons after warm debate, and had reached the committee\r\nstage in the lords when, on the 19th, the king was declared to be\r\nconvalescent. His recovery progressed steadily, and on March 10 he\r\nannounced to parliament, through commissioners, his complete restoration\r\nto health. Both on that night, and on April 23, when he returned thanks\r\nin St. Paul's, there were great rejoicings, for his illness enshrined\r\nhim in the hearts of his people. The skill and temper which Pitt\r\nexhibited throughout the long crisis strengthened his position in\r\nparliament and his place in the esteem of the public, and from that time\r\nmore cordial relations were established between him and the king, who\r\nwarmly acknowledged his obligations to him. Though he was fortunate in\r\nthe king's timely recovery, he owed much also to Fox's bad management.\r\nThe hasty assertion of the prince's rights and the delays interposed in\r\nthe proceedings in the commons put off the settlement of the regency\r\nuntil it was no longer needed, while the attack on the authority of\r\nparliament on behalf of the prince's prerogative and the reckless\r\nattempt of Fox and his party to displace a ministry which had the\r\nconfidence of the nation, in order to obtain office for themselves,\r\nbrought general censure upon them and added to Pitt's popularity.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the parliament met in 1789 when the regency question was\r\nstill before the English parliament. Buckingham, who as Earl Temple was\r\nlord-lieutenant in 1782-83, had succeeded Rutland in 1787. He hoped that\r\nthe Irish would adopt the English plan. He was disappointed by their\r\nextreme jealousy of anything which might look like dependence. The\r\nfunctions of the viceroy rendered the question of restrictions of little\r\nimportance, and, under the guidance of Grattan, an address was voted\r\ninviting the prince to assume the regency of the kingdom without\r\nlimitations. Buckingham refused to forward it on the ground that it\r\npurported to invest the prince with a power not conferred on him by law;\r\nfor the prince could not lawfully take any part of the royal authority\r\nwithout an act of parliament, and no Irish bill could be enacted without\r\nthe royal assent under the great seal. The cabinet approved of his\r\nrefusal. The parliament sent commissioners over with the address; but by\r\nthe time that it was presented the king was virtually recovered, and the\r\nmatter ended ineffectually. No serious consequences probably would in\r\nany case have arisen from the course adopted by the Irish parliament,\r\nbut the difference between the two countries on so important a question\r\nenforced the need of a legislative union. Soon after the conclusion of\r\nthis business Sydney resigned the home office. He differed from Pitt on\r\nthe slave trade question, and Pitt was probably glad to get a colleague\r\nmore thoroughly at one with him. He was succeeded by William Grenville\r\non June 5, and Henry Addington was elected speaker in Grenville's place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE FRENCH REVOLUTION BEGINS._]\r\n\r\nIn the summer news of a revolution arrived from Paris. The reforming\r\nmovement, in which all European states had some share, was promoted in\r\nFrance by ideas of constitutional government borrowed from England, by\r\nthe attacks of Voltaire on medievalism and religious authority, by the\r\nadvance of science, by the teaching of the encyclopaedists, by the\r\nexaltation of individual liberty by political economists, by Rousseau's\r\nromantic theories on the foundations of society, and by sympathy with\r\nthe American revolution. It was supplied with practical aims by the\r\nmisery of the poor, the injustice done to the lower classes, which alone\r\npaid the heaviest of the taxes, the privileges of the nobles and clergy,\r\nthe harshness of the laws, and arbitrary methods of government. England,\r\nas we have seen, shared in the reforming movement. Here, however, it had\r\nno such violent results as in France. No sharp lines divided class from\r\nclass; the laws were the same for all, there was no difference in\r\ntaxation, and no privileged caste, for a peer's younger sons were\r\ncommoners, as was his eldest son so long as his father lived.\r\nParliamentary and other free institutions, imperfect as they were,\r\nsecured the liberties of the people. The life of the agricultural poor\r\nthough hard was not intolerable; landowners lived upon their estates and\r\ndirected local affairs, and the poor were at least kept from starvation.\r\nFrance was almost bankrupt, ruined by the prodigality of her two last\r\nkings and their neglect of their duties to their people. Louis XVI. was\r\nforced to summon the states-general, which met at Versailles on May 4,\r\n1789. Political discontent was rife and was rendered dangerous by the\r\ndistress of the poor; the winter had been hard, prices were rising, and\r\nParis was full of destitute persons, of labourers out of work, and along\r\nwith them a large number of criminals and ruffians.\r\n\r\nThe deputies of the \"third estate,\" who were about equal in number to\r\nthose of the two privileged orders and were supported by a few nobles\r\nand a large minority of the clergy, demanded that the three estates\r\nshould form a single chamber. The king upheld the privileged orders in\r\ntheir refusal. The third estate voted itself a \"national assembly,\" and,\r\nafter a struggle of six weeks, gained its point, and the estates were\r\nconstituted as a single assembly. Paris was in a ferment of excitement.\r\nThe king dismissed Necker, the minister of finance, who was trusted by\r\nthe popular party, and refused to withdraw his troops from the city. A\r\nriot broke out, and on July 14 the Bastille, an ancient fortress and\r\nprison, then little used, which was guarded by a few Swiss and some old\r\nsoldiers or _invalides_, was taken by the mob, and the governor and some\r\nothers were murdered. The king's brother, the Count of Artois, the\r\nPrince of Conde, and several unpopular nobles fled from France. A new\r\nmunicipality was established and Lafayette was chosen to command a new\r\ncivic militia or national guard. Disorder and rioting prevailed in the\r\nprovinces, country-houses were burnt and pillaged, and many murders were\r\ncommitted. Louis was forced to assent to all the demands of the people;\r\nhe recalled Necker, and showed himself at the Hotel de Ville wearing the\r\nnational cockade or tricolour. The assembly voted decrees sweeping away\r\nthe feudal system, abolishing the privileges of classes and\r\ncorporations, and ecclesiastical tithes, and promulgated a flatulent\r\ndeclaration of the rights of man. Bread-riots broke out in Paris on\r\nOctober 5; a mob marched on Versailles and invaded the palace, and on\r\nthe 6th the national guard brought the king and queen to Paris, where\r\nthey remained in virtual captivity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLISH OPINIONS ON EVENTS IN FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nThe first tidings of the movement were received in England with\r\nsatisfaction. It was generally believed that the insurrection would\r\nshortly end in the establishment of constitutional government, that\r\nwhile the troubles lasted France would cease to be formidable, and that\r\nconsequently a continuance of peace and relief from taxation might be\r\nexpected. Before long, however, the acts of violence and the spoliation\r\neffected by the decrees of the assembly roused widespread disgust. As\r\nlate as February, 1790, Pitt, while stigmatising the liberty proclaimed\r\nin France as \"absolute slavery,\" believed that the commotions would end\r\nin order and true liberty. Burke from the first held that the outburst\r\nof \"Parisian ferocity\" proved that it was doubtful whether the French\r\nwere fit for liberty; he maintained that, though the power of France\r\nmight cease to be formidable, its example was to be dreaded, and\r\nexpressed his abhorrence of the destruction of the institutions of the\r\nkingdom. Fox, on the other hand, as he had delighted in the American\r\nrevolution, delighted in the revolution in France. Of the fall of the\r\nBastille, which had made hardly any impression on French public opinion,\r\nhe wrote: \"How much the greatest event it is that has happened in the\r\nworld; and how much the best!\" While he regretted the bloodshed which\r\naccompanied the revolution, he constantly declared his exultation in its\r\nsuccesses. A comparatively small party of democrats, supported by the\r\npolitical dissenters under the leadership of the Unitarian ministers\r\nPrice and Priestley, noisily expressed their sympathy with the French\r\ndemocrats; and some men of high position, such as Lords Stanhope and\r\nLansdowne, professed more or less republican principles. The revolution\r\nsociety under the presidency of Stanhope sent an address to the French\r\nassembly, and clubs were formed in many large towns \"avowedly affiliated\r\nto the democratic clubs in France\".[220]\r\n\r\nThe difference between Burke and Fox on this matter was openly declared\r\nin the debate on the army estimates in February, 1790. Fox in a\r\nmischievous speech referred to the part taken by the French army in\r\nforwarding the revolution, and said that it was a time when he should be\r\nleast jealous of an increase in the army, since the example of France\r\nhad shown that \"a man by becoming a soldier did not cease to be a\r\ncitizen\". Burke declared that France was setting an example of anarchy,\r\nfraud, violence, and atheism, and that the worst part of its example was\r\nthe interference in civil affairs of \"base hireling mutineers\" who\r\ndeserted their officers \"to join a furious licentious populace\". He\r\nprotested against a comparison between the revolution in France and the\r\nrevolution of 1688, between the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion\r\nand the behaviour of some of the French troops. His speech, which was\r\nreceived with general applause, had a strong effect on opinion, and Pitt\r\nand others expressed their agreement with it. Fox answered him in a\r\nconciliatory tone. Sheridan fanned the flame; he taunted Burke with\r\ninconsistency, and pronounced a panegyric on the revolutionary leaders.\r\nBurke replied that thenceforth he and Sheridan were separated in\r\npolitics. A rift in the opposition was started, and an attempt to close\r\nit by a conference two days later was ineffectual. The opinion of\r\nparliament on two other questions during the session was, seemingly,\r\ninfluenced by events in France. Fox renewed the attack on the test acts.\r\nHe was opposed by Pitt; and Burke, whose speech, Fox said, filled him\r\n\"with grief and shame,\" animadverted on the overthrow of the Church in\r\nFrance, and maintained that Price, Priestley, and other dissenters hoped\r\nto overthrow the Church of England. Fox's motion was defeated by 294 to\r\n105. A motion for parliamentary reform by Flood, who then represented an\r\nEnglish constituency, was opposed by Pitt, Windham, and Burke, and was\r\nrejected without a division. The session ended on June 10, and\r\nparliament was dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANISH CLAIM TO NOOTKA SOUND._]\r\n\r\nEngland reaped material benefit from the temporary extinction of France\r\nas a factor in the affairs of Europe, consequent on the proceedings of\r\nthe assembly. Some difficulties with Spain had been removed by a\r\nconvention arranged in 1786, by which Great Britain agreed to withdraw\r\nthe settlers from the Mosquito coast, and the Spanish king allowed them\r\nto occupy a district in Honduras. As this compliance on the part of\r\nEngland checked the smuggling of goods into the Spanish colonies, it was\r\nwell received by Spain. Hostile feelings towards England soon revived.\r\nFlorida Blanca, the Spanish minister, was anxious to increase trade with\r\nthe colonies, and was determined to keep it exclusively for the\r\nmother-country. It was impossible to prevent English ships from\r\ninterfering with it. The colonies of Spanish America were discontented;\r\nsome insurrections had been made with the object of gaining direct trade\r\nwith other nations, and the malcontents hoped for help from\r\nEngland.[221] Florida Blanca believed that England sought first to\r\nestablish direct commercial communication with her Spanish American\r\ncolonies, and, finally, to separate them from the mother-country.[222]\r\nHe was determined to prevent these designs, which had no existence in\r\nEngland, and was upheld in his purpose by the extravagant opinion held\r\nby himself and his nation as to the strength of their country. He found\r\nhis opportunity in 1789. Some English merchants had established a\r\nsettlement at Nootka Sound, off Vancouver's island, for trade in furs\r\nand ginseng with China. In April one of their ships with its cargo was\r\nseized in the Sound by a Spanish frigate, the officers and crew were\r\nmaltreated, and two more ships were seized shortly afterwards.\r\nSatisfaction was demanded by the English government, and was refused by\r\nSpain on the grounds that all lands on the west coast of America as far\r\nas 60 deg. north latitude were under the dominion of Spain, and further that\r\nNootka belonged to Spain, because it had been discovered and occupied by\r\na Spanish captain four years before Cook visited those coasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONVENTION WITH SPAIN._]\r\n\r\nThe English government held that these pretensions were inadmissible,\r\nfor there was no effective occupation by Spain; it refused to discuss\r\nthem, and claimed that the king's subjects had a right to navigate and\r\nfish in those waters and settle on unoccupied lands.[223] Spain prepared\r\nfor war, and Florida Blanca seems to have made overtures to Austria and\r\nRussia in the vain hope that they would enter into an active alliance\r\nwith his court.[224] The affair was kept secret in England until May 3,\r\nwhen the preparations of Spain demanded immediate action. On that day an\r\norder in council was passed for pressing seamen in every port in the\r\nkingdom, and the commons unanimously agreed to a vote of credit of\r\nL1,000,000 for expenses. The matter was laid before the two other\r\nmembers of the triple alliance; the Dutch at once fitted out a squadron\r\nto act with the British fleet, and a favourable answer was received from\r\nthe Prussian king. The French ministers, moved by the news of the naval\r\npreparations of Great Britain, and expecting to be called on to fulfil\r\nthe obligation expressed in the family compact, ordered the armament of\r\nfourteen ships of the line. On this the national assembly voted that it\r\nhad the right to decide on questions of war, and on May 22 declared that\r\nthe French nation renounced wars of conquest. This grandiloquent decree\r\ndestroyed the effect of the armament. Nevertheless, Spain was set on\r\nwar; fleets were gathered at Ferrol and Cadiz, and a loan of L4,000,000\r\nwas arranged. Florida Blanca seems to have relied on help from the\r\nUnited States, and made some efforts to gain their good-will, but they\r\ndid not respond to them.[225] From France he peremptorily demanded the\r\nassistance to which Louis was pledged by the family compact. His demand\r\nwas laid before the national assembly, and on August 25 it was decided\r\nto substitute a new _pacte national_ for the _pacte de famille_, and to\r\ninvite the king to arm forty-five ships for defence, and to revise the\r\ntreaty; and a suggestion was made to Spain that she might confirm the\r\nnew compact by the cession of Louisiana. This was mere folly. The\r\nEnglish ministers notified the French government that any help given to\r\nSpain would be promptly resented,[226] and Florida Blanca seeing that no\r\nreliance was to be placed on France entered into negotiations with\r\nEngland. During their progress a fresh cause of offence was given to\r\nEngland; for in September McDonald, captain of a British West Indiaman,\r\nreported that his ship had been stopped by a Spanish frigate in the Gulf\r\nof Florida, that he had been forced to go aboard the Spaniard, and had\r\nthere been cruelly tortured, being set in the bilboes in the blazing\r\nsun.[227] For this outrage satisfaction was promptly made, and on\r\nOctober 28 a treaty was signed between Great Britain and Spain by which\r\nSpain yielded to the demands of the British court with reference to the\r\nNootka Sound affair and restored the disputed territory. The submission\r\nof Spain marks a complete change in her policy; she sought by compliance\r\ntowards England to gain the security no longer to be looked for from\r\nalliance with France. It was a signal triumph for Pitt, who as usual had\r\ndirected the proceedings of the foreign office, for Carmarthen, who\r\nsucceeded his father as Duke of Leeds in 1789, was a feeble person. Pitt\r\nhad broken up the family compact and could reckon on the compliance of\r\nSpain. France was isolated and had exhibited her weakness before the\r\neyes of Europe. The despicable proceedings of the national assembly\r\nsaved England from a war, and dissolved the alliance which had so long\r\nthreatened her.[228]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[208] _Parl.

The\r\ngeneral election of 1790 proved that Pitt had thoroughly gained the\r\nconfidence of the nation, for it increased his already large majority.\r\nThe election presented one noteworthy incident; Horne Tooke, though in\r\nholy orders, and consequently supposed to be disqualified, presented\r\nhimself for election at Westminster; he retired before the close of the\r\npoll, and the question of the qualification of clergymen to sit in\r\nparliament was not decided until 1801. In consequence of the hostility\r\nof the chancellor, Pitt needed some one to lead his party in the lords,\r\nand chose William Grenville, the secretary of state for home affairs,\r\nwho was created Baron Grenville. The expenses of the armament against\r\nSpain amounted to nearly L3,000,000; the prosperity of the country\r\nwarranted Pitt's decision not to allow any interruption in the progress\r\nof the reduction of debt; he obtained L500,000 from the Bank of England\r\nwithout interest, on the strength of unclaimed dividends, and proposed\r\nto obtain the remainder by taxation. The question was raised whether the\r\ndissolution put an end to the prosecution of Hastings. That an\r\nimpeachment was not \"abated\" by a dissolution had been affirmed by the\r\nlords in the case of Lord Danby in 1679, but this decision was reversed\r\nin 1685. Precedents were obscure, and the great lawyers differed. Pitt,\r\nwho on this question sided with Fox and Burke, argued on broad\r\nconstitutional grounds that an act of the crown should not hinder the\r\ncommons in the exercise of a right, and it was agreed by both houses\r\nthat an impeachment should remain _in statu quo_ from one parliament to\r\nanother. The trial was resumed in 1791. After lasting for seven years it\r\nended in 1795 in the acquittal of the accused on every count. The\r\ndecision was generally approved. If in the midst of extraordinary\r\ndifficulties Hastings did some things hard to justify, he was at the\r\nleast a great ruler, firm, self-reliant, patient, and enlightened, who\r\nserved his country well. He lived until 1818, honoured in his old age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT ON THE SLAVE TRADE._]\r\n\r\nThe relief granted to English Roman catholics in 1778 was extended in\r\n1791. Though they were still precluded from sitting in parliament and\r\nholding public offices, a bill introduced by John Mitford, afterwards\r\nLord Redesdale, gave complete freedom of worship and education,\r\nadmission to the legal profession, and exemption from vexatious\r\nliabilities to all catholics who took an oath of an unobjectionable\r\ncharacter. Pitt approved of the bill, and Fox supported it, though he\r\nwished that it had gone further, and declared his dislike of all tests.\r\nA bill placing Scottish catholics in virtually the same position as\r\ntheir co-religionists in England was passed in 1793. The confiscation of\r\nChurch property in France strengthened the unwillingness of the commons\r\nto weaken the position of the Church at home. A motion to relieve the\r\nScottish presbyterians from the obligation of the test act was lost by a\r\nlarge majority, and a motion for the relief of unitarians, which must be\r\nnoticed later, also failed. Since 1789 Wilberforce had been working on a\r\ncommittee for collecting evidence with respect to the slave trade. In\r\n1791 he made a motion for its abolition which was supported both by Pitt\r\nand Fox, but was defeated by 163 to 88. He repeated his motion in 1792.\r\nThe king had at first favoured the cause, but a shocking massacre of the\r\nwhite population in the French portion of St. Domingo by the negroes,\r\nwho were excited by the preaching of the \"rights of man,\" turned him\r\nagainst it, and he thenceforward regarded abolition as jacobinical.\r\nThurlow, Hawkesbury, and Dundas were strongly opposed to it. Pitt could\r\nnot, therefore, make it a government measure without almost certainly\r\nwrecking his administration. He supported the motion with a speech of\r\nsurpassing eloquence. Public opinion made a direct negative no longer\r\npossible; but the West India merchants and planters and the shipping\r\ninterest were powerful, and the anti-abolitionists were strengthened by\r\nthe king's known dislike to the cause. The motion was met by arguments\r\nfor delay, and an amendment proposed by Dundas for gradual abolition was\r\ncarried. A resolution was finally adopted that the trade should cease in\r\n1796. The lords postponed the question. Year after year Wilberforce,\r\nsupported by James Stephen, Zachary Macaulay, and others, carried on the\r\nstruggle for the abolition of the trade with noble persistency. The\r\nvictory was not attained until 1807.\r\n\r\nAnother measure on which Pitt and Fox were also in full accord was more\r\nsuccessful. Lord Mansfield's pronouncement in the action against Almon,\r\nthe bookseller, in 1770, which reserved the question of the criminality\r\nof a libel for the decision of the court, was, it will be remembered,\r\nwidely condemned as an invasion of the rights of jurors. Of late years\r\nthese rights had successfully been maintained by the famous advocate\r\nErskine. When, for example, in 1789, in consequence of a motion by Fox,\r\na publisher, Stockdale, was prosecuted by the crown for a libel on the\r\npromoters of the trial of Hastings, Erskine contended that the whole\r\npamphlet in question should be considered by the jury, and procured an\r\nacquittal. Fox, who in his early days had jeered at the rights of\r\njurors, introduced a bill in 1791 declaring their right to give a\r\ngeneral verdict in a case of libel. His speech was one of his finest; he\r\nwas ably seconded by Erskine; Pitt gave him his aid, and the bill was\r\npassed unanimously by the commons. Thurlow, who disliked the bill,\r\nprevailed on the lords to postpone it until the next session. When it\r\nwas again sent up by the commons in 1792, he obtained a delay until the\r\njudges should have been consulted. Their opinion, though hesitating, was\r\nunfavourable to the bill. The aged Camden, however, spoke strongly in\r\nits favour, and it was carried in spite of the chancellor's opposition.\r\nThis statute, of which Fox, Erskine, and Pitt share the credit, placed\r\nthe liberty of the press in the hands of jurors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EUROPEAN POLITICS._]\r\n\r\nFrom 1788 Pitt's foreign policy was directed towards the pacification of\r\nEurope and the maintenance of the balance of power by means of the\r\ntriple alliance between Great Britain, Prussia, and Holland. Catherine\r\nof Russia, who was bent on the overthrow of the Turkish empire, and on\r\nstrengthening her hold on Poland, pressed the Turks until they declared\r\nwar in 1787. The next year the emperor Joseph declared war against them.\r\nGustavus III. of Sweden allied himself with the Turks and invaded\r\nFinland. His expedition failed, and Denmark, the ally of Russia, invaded\r\nhis kingdom. Sweden was in imminent danger; its overthrow would have\r\ngiven Russia absolute sway in the Baltic; the commerce of England and\r\nHolland would have been seriously affected, and the coast of Prussia\r\nendangered. The allied powers interfered, and a threat that Prussia\r\nwould invade Holstein, and a British fleet sail for the Sound, compelled\r\nDenmark to cease hostilities, and saved the independence of Sweden.\r\nCatherine was deeply offended, and when the allies offered to mediate a\r\npeace between her and the Turks, returned a decided refusal. She pressed\r\non the war with success, and the capture of Ochakov extended her\r\ndominions to the Dniester.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's war was unsuccessful. He was in great difficulties; for\r\nHungary was restless and his Netherland provinces in revolt. The allies\r\nmight have mediated a peace between him and the Turks on the basis of\r\nthe _status quo_ before the war, had it not been for the desire of\r\nFrederick William to use the difficulties of Austria for his own\r\nadvantage. He designed to compel Austria to a peace by which she should\r\nrestore Galicia to Poland, in order that in return Poland should cede to\r\nhim Dantzig and Thorn; and he would have compensated Austria by allowing\r\nthe emperor to conquer and retain Moldavia and Walachia. He hoped to\r\naccomplish this through his alliance with England and Holland, and in\r\norder further to weaken Austria proposed that the revolted Netherlands\r\nshould be united to Holland as one republic, urging that they might\r\notherwise fall into the hands of France. Pitt desired to arrange a peace\r\non the _status quo_ basis, and to extend the triple alliance by the\r\ninclusion of other powers; and, highly as he valued the Prussian\r\nalliance, he would not consent that, merely to aggrandise Prussia,\r\nEngland should lend herself to a policy which would almost certainly\r\nhave led to a new war. Accordingly, the Duke of Leeds warned Frederick\r\nWilliam that his plans went beyond the treaty of alliance, which was\r\npurely defensive. The death of the emperor Joseph, on February 20, 1790,\r\nchanged the situation, for his successor, Leopold II., was a practical\r\nand wary statesman. Frederick William was bent on war against Russia\r\nand Austria, his minister signed a treaty with the Turks, and he pressed\r\nEngland to acknowledge the independence of the Austrian Netherlands. The\r\nEnglish government took a decided line, made him clearly understand that\r\nin the event of a war he would be isolated, and proposed an immediate\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\nFrederick William at last yielded to the representations of England and\r\nHolland. Through the mediation of the allies an armistice between\r\nAustria and the Turks was arranged on the basis of the _status quo_ at a\r\ncongress at Reichenbach in July, 1790, and a formal peace was concluded\r\nthe next year at Sistova. The English government, anxious to prevent an\r\nalliance between the revolted Netherlands and France, desired the\r\nrestoration of the Austrian power in the provinces, under conditions\r\nwhich would shut out French influence by satisfying the people; and\r\naccordingly the allies guaranteed the liberties of the provinces, and\r\nthey were regained by the emperor. The ministry agreed with Prussia that\r\nsupport must be given to Sweden, which was exhausted by its war with\r\nRussia; a subsidy was promised and a squadron lay in the Downs ready to\r\nsail for the Baltic. As soon as Catherine heard of the issue of the\r\nconference at Reichenbach, she made a peace with Gustavus without the\r\nmediation of the allies, which was concluded at Werela in August. So\r\nfar, then, in spite of serious difficulties arising from the ambition of\r\nthe Prussian king, the triple alliance had enabled the government to\r\ncarry out its policy with success. Its formation secured the Dutch from\r\nthe ascendency of France; it strengthened the position of England in its\r\nquarrel with Spain, saved the independence of Sweden, mediated peace on\r\nthe basis of the _status quo_ between Austria and the Porte, hindered\r\nthe spread of French influence in the Netherlands, and indirectly\r\nrestored peace in the Baltic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE RUSSIAN ARMAMENT._]\r\n\r\nPitt's policy, however, received one decided check. Catherine rejected\r\nthe proposal of England that she should make peace with the Turks on the\r\nbasis of the _status quo_ before the war, and declared that she would\r\nkeep Ochakov and the line of the Dniester. Pitt differed from the views\r\nheld by his father, the whigs generally, and the coalition, with\r\nreference to Russia. They looked on Russia as the natural ally of\r\nEngland, both for commercial reasons and as a counterpoise to the\r\nBourbon alliance, and Catherine owed much to England's good-will in her\r\nwar with the Turks in 1770 and during her conquest of Crimea in 1783.\r\nTimes had changed; and Pitt regarded with displeasure the establishment\r\nof Russia on the Black Sea and the prospect of the conquest of\r\nConstantinople, and held that the Turks were useful as a check on\r\nRussian aggrandisement. The possession of Ochakov was believed to be of\r\nthe first importance in the struggle between the two powers. Frederick\r\nWilliam urged that Catherine should be forced to resign it. In 1790 Pitt\r\nwas opposing his wishes elsewhere; he was unwilling to alienate him\r\naltogether, and agreed to put pressure on Russia. The Turks were\r\nrepeatedly defeated, and in December Suvorov (Suwarrow) took Ismail;\r\n12,000 Russians and 28,000 Turks perishing in the storming and sack of\r\nthe city, which are described in Byron's splendid verse. In the\r\nfollowing March, in spite of some opposition, Pitt persuaded the cabinet\r\nto agree to send a fleet to the Baltic, and a squadron to the Black Sea\r\nto assist the Turks, while Frederick William invaded Livonia, and on the\r\n27th an ultimatum was despatched to St. Petersburg.[229]\r\n\r\nThe next day a royal message to parliament announced the augmentation of\r\nthe navy. Pitt sought to obtain a pledge that parliament would support\r\nthe government in its proposed action. He met with strong opposition.\r\nFox and others in both houses maintained that our true policy was to be\r\non good terms with Russia, and that Russia had an undoubted right to\r\nretain Ochakov. \"The balance of Europe,\" it was urged, could not be\r\noverset by its retention; it was a matter which did not concern England;\r\na war with Russia would be disastrous to English trade and manufactures;\r\nif Russia became a power in the Mediterranean so much the better, as its\r\nfleet would be a check on the fleets of France and Spain. Burke\r\nvehemently protested against England embarking on an \"anti-crusade\" by\r\nassisting \"destructive savages,\" as he called the Turks, against a\r\nChristian power. Four times, in one form or another, the question was\r\ndebated in the commons. The government majorities were large, though\r\nless than normal. In the cabinet Grenville opposed the armament, and\r\nPitt found that the feeling of the country generally, and specially of\r\nthe city of London and the mercantile class, was strong on the same\r\nside. He yielded on April 16; a messenger was sent in hot haste to St.\r\nPetersburg to prevent the presentation of the ultimatum, and the\r\nPrussian king was informed that the fleet would not sail to the Baltic.\r\nCatherine was triumphant; she kept Ochakov and the line of the Dniester,\r\nmade terms with the Turks without the intervention of other powers on\r\nAugust 11, 1791, and concluded a definite peace at Jassy in the\r\nfollowing January. Freed from her wars with Sweden and the Porte, and\r\nfrom the danger of foreign intervention in both cases, she was again\r\nable to pursue her designs on Poland. She complimented Fox on the part\r\nhe had played, and placed his bust in her palace between those of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero. Pitt, who had lately refused the king's offer of\r\nthe garter, sarcastically referred in parliament to the compliments his\r\nopponent received from a foreign sovereign.\r\n\r\nPitt's prestige was for a time seriously injured by this failure and\r\npeople talked of a possible change of government. Leeds considered that\r\nas foreign secretary he was specially compromised, and resigned the\r\nseals. As it was more difficult to find a foreign than a home secretary,\r\nPitt recommended that Grenville should be transferred to the foreign\r\ndepartment, that Cornwallis should take Grenville's place, and that,\r\nuntil Cornwallis returned from India, Dundas should have the seals, and\r\nfurther suggested that Lord Hawkesbury (Jenkinson), then president of\r\nthe board of trade, should be called to the cabinet. George agreed, but\r\nas Cornwallis declined the offer Dundas remained home secretary. Pitt\r\nlearnt that Ochakov was not so important as he at first imagined; indeed\r\nthe possession of it by the Turks would not have rendered Constantinople\r\nsafe from attack nor protected Poland from further partition. His\r\nfailure, however, to carry out his scheme of coercing Russia was a\r\nserious matter; it destroyed his hopes of an extension of the defensive\r\nalliance, and the triple alliance itself, on which his foreign policy\r\nhad been built, virtually came to an end. Frederick William was deeply\r\nannoyed and, in order to strengthen his position with regard to Russia,\r\nmade advances to Austria, which led to an alliance between the two\r\npowers and to their joint invasion of France.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the great majority of the nation with regard to the\r\nrevolution in France was decided by the publication of Burke's\r\n_Reflections on the French Revolution_ in November, 1790. This famous\r\nwork was primarily intended to rebut the assertions of Price and others\r\nthat the revolution in France was a more perfect development of the\r\nideas of the English revolution of 1688, that Englishmen had a right to\r\nchoose their own governors, cashier them for misconduct, and frame a\r\ngovernment for themselves. It describes the constitution as an\r\ninheritance to be handed down to posterity uninjured and, if needs be,\r\nimproved, and exhibits and condemns the measures of the French assembly\r\nas precipitate, unjust, and doomed to failure. Splendid alike as a\r\nliterary achievement and as a store-house of political wisdom, it is\r\nalso remarkable as a proof of Burke's prescience, for though he wrote at\r\nan early stage of the revolution, before those savage excesses which\r\nhave made it a by-word, he foretold its future course, not indeed\r\nwithout errors, but with wonderful sagacity. Superbly national in\r\nsentiment, the book met the propaganda of French ideas by appealing to\r\nthe pride with which Englishmen regarded their own institutions. Its\r\nsuccess was immense. Paine answered it in his _Rights of Man_,\r\nexpressing revolutionary ideas with a crude force which influenced\r\nthousands too ignorant to detect its fallacies; and Mackintosh in his\r\n_Vindiciae Gallicae_ expounded in polished sentences the position of the\r\nwhig sympathisers with the revolution. Neither undid the effect of\r\nBurke's work. Of the well-to-do of all classes there was scarcely one\r\nman in twenty who did not become an ardent anti-jacobin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RUPTURE BETWEEN BURKE AND FOX._]\r\n\r\nStimulated by the success of the _Reflections_, Fox lost no opportunity\r\nof declaring his admiration of the revolution in parliament, and his\r\nfollowers irritated Burke by thwarting his attempts to reply. At last\r\nthe crisis came during a debate on a bill for the government of Canada.\r\nAfter the settlement of the United Empire Loyalists in western Canada,\r\nthe demands of the British colonists for the repeal of the Quebec act of\r\n1774 became urgent. Pitt recognised the value of the French population\r\nas a conservative force, a check on revolt, and in order to do justice\r\nto both peoples, introduced a bill dividing the dominion into two\r\nprovinces, Upper and Lower Canada, each with its own governor, elective\r\nassembly, and legislative council. Burke supported this measure, which\r\nwas passed, and is known as the constitutional act of 1791. Fox objected\r\nto the principle of the bill on the ground that the French and English\r\ninhabitants should coalesce, and to two special provisions in it, one\r\nthat the sovereign might grant hereditary titles with a right to sit in\r\nthe council, the other reserving certain crown lands for the support of\r\nthe protestant clergy. He blamed the proposal to revive titles of honour\r\nin Canada when they had been abolished in France, and jeered at Burke's\r\nlament in the _Reflections_ on the extinction of the spirit of chivalry\r\namong the French. A few days later, on May 6, Burke, after much baiting\r\nby Fox's party, spoke strongly of the danger of French propagandism, and\r\ndeclared that at the risk of the desertion of friends he would exclaim\r\nwith his latest breath, \"Fly from the French constitution!\" \"There is no\r\nloss of friends,\" Fox whispered. \"Yes,\" he said, \"there is a loss of\r\nfriends. I have done my duty at the price of my friend; our friendship\r\nis at an end.\" When Fox rose to reply the tears trickled down his\r\ncheeks. The rupture was permanent. Burke stood alone. His former friends\r\ntreated him as a renegade, and the whig newspapers showered abuse upon\r\nhim. His answer was a powerful vindication of the consistency of his\r\nposition in his _Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs_, which had a\r\ndecided effect on the opinions of many of Fox's party.\r\n\r\nIn June came the French king's flight to Varennes and his enforced\r\nreturn to Paris. His queen Marie Antoinette appealed to her brother the\r\nemperor for help. Leopold would do nothing save in concert with the\r\nother great powers, and learnt that England would take no part in a\r\ncongress.[230] Pitt, always more interested in domestic reforms than in\r\nforeign politics, had no intention of interfering in the internal\r\naffairs of France. War would hinder the commercial progress of the\r\ncountry; he wanted fifteen years of peace to secure the full benefits of\r\nhis economic reforms: his policy was one of strict neutrality. He shared\r\nin the general belief, so soon proved to be mistaken, that the\r\nrevolution would prevent France from engaging in war and would ensure\r\nyears of peace to England; the funds were high and commerce was\r\nflourishing. Leopold could only look to Prussia for co-operation. The\r\nattitude of England decided that of Spain. Gustavus of Sweden was,\r\nindeed, eager for a war of a crusading kind to re-establish the old\r\n_regime_, but this idea was contrary to the policy of both Austria and\r\nPrussia, and Gustavus allied himself with the French emigrant princes\r\nwho commanded an army at Coblentz; themselves selfish and intriguing,\r\ntheir army undisciplined and ill-provided; Leopold rated them at their\r\nproper value and was on his guard against them. Frederick William,\r\nuntrustworthy as he was, seems to have been sincerely anxious to help\r\nthe French king. Leopold hoped to avoid war; he distrusted Prussia, and\r\nthe designs of Catherine on Poland caused both sovereigns to hesitate.\r\nIn August, however, the diet demanded that Leopold should support\r\ncertain princes of the German empire against France. He held a\r\nconference with Frederick William at Pilnitz, and on the 27th the two\r\nmonarchs signed a declaration that they would employ force on behalf of\r\nthe French king, provided that the powers to which they applied would\r\njoin them. Leopold knew that England would refuse, and the declaration\r\nwas nugatory. It enraged the French, and was used by the _emigres_ as\r\nthough it promised the fulfilment of their hopes for an invasion of\r\nFrance by a foreign confederation. Calonne, who acted as their minister,\r\napplied to Pitt for an assurance of neutrality and for a loan. Pitt\r\nrefused his requests and would not recognise him as having any formal\r\nauthority. On September 13 Louis was forced to accept the new French\r\nconstitution, and Leopold declared that his acceptance put an end to all\r\nneed for intervention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA._]\r\n\r\nThe French were not content to leave other peoples alone. To the more\r\nardent revolutionists the revolution was not a mere political event in\r\nthe history of their country; it was a religion which it was the mission\r\nof France to propagate. No part of France was to remain outside it; the\r\nfeudal rights of princes of the empire in Alsace and Lorraine were\r\nabolished, and Avignon and the Venaissin were declared French territory.\r\nNo people wishing to share in its benefits was to be left unenlightened,\r\nand French democrats were already intriguing with the factions in the\r\nNetherlands which were opposed to the Austrian rule. In England the\r\npropaganda had as yet made little way, though the democrats were noisy.\r\nAt Birmingham, where Priestley had his chapel, they arranged to hold a\r\ndinner on July 14 to celebrate the fall of the Bastille, and a seditious\r\naddress was circulated. In the evening of that day a violent riot broke\r\nout. The mob, with shouts of \"Church and king,\" wrecked two dissenting\r\nchapels and seven houses belonging to prominent democrats, one of them\r\nPriestley's house, where they destroyed his library, philosophical\r\napparatus, and papers. The riot lasted for two days and was finally\r\nquelled by dragoons. Three of the rioters were hanged, and over L26,000\r\nwas paid by the neighbouring hundreds as compensation to the sufferers.\r\n\r\nThough both as a king and as a German prince George was indignant at the\r\nproceedings of the French revolutionists, he fully acquiesced in Pitt's\r\ndetermined neutrality. How little at the beginning of the session of\r\n1792 Pitt expected to be driven from his position is shown by the line\r\nwhich he adopted in parliament. The king's speech declared that the\r\nstate of Europe seemed to promise that the country would continue to\r\nenjoy tranquillity. The naval force was reduced to 16,000 men, and the\r\nproposed reductions in the two services amounted to L200,000. For the\r\nlast four years there had been an average yearly surplus of L400,000,\r\nand Pitt proposed to add L200,000 a year to the sinking fund and to\r\nremit taxes to the same amount. He also instituted an additional system\r\nfor the reduction of debt by providing that every new loan should carry\r\na sinking fund of its own. When this scheme was before the lords,\r\nThurlow poured ridicule upon it, and spoke of its author with contempt.\r\nThe king wrote to Pitt, hoping that his old friend would own himself in\r\nthe wrong, and that Pitt would overlook the offence. Pitt, who had borne\r\nlong enough with Thurlow's sullen temper and constant opposition, told\r\nthe king plainly that he must choose between him and the chancellor.\r\nGeorge did not hesitate, and Thurlow, much to his surprise, received an\r\norder to give up the great seal. He retired at the end of the session,\r\non June 15, and the great seal was put in commission. Pitt's ascendency\r\nin the cabinet was placed beyond dispute. The dismissal of Thurlow marks\r\na step in the progress of the development of the cabinet system. It was\r\nno longer possible, as in the earlier years of the reign, for a minister\r\nto remain in office, through the king's favour, against the will of the\r\nprime minister. When a prime minister is dissatisfied with one of his\r\ncolleagues he can insist on his resignation, for if he requests his\r\ndismissal, his request cannot be rejected unless the sovereign is\r\nprepared to take new advisers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A WHIG SCHEME OF COALITION._]\r\n\r\nThe loss of the chancellor was erroneously believed to have weakened\r\nthe government. Some of the whig party, of which the Duke of Portland\r\nwas the recognised head, busied themselves in devising a coalition\r\ngovernment. Apart from the sweets of office, the condition of their\r\nparty rendered the idea specially attractive to them. Burke's appeal to\r\nthe whigs to maintain their old principles, which he urged in person at\r\na meeting of the heads of the party on June 9, 1792, convinced them that\r\nunless Fox moderated \"his tone and temper,\" it might become impossible\r\nfor them to continue to work with him. A junction with the government\r\nmight save them from disruption. It was proposed that Pitt should resign\r\nthe treasury, that he and Fox should be joint secretaries of state and\r\nthat the treasury should be held by the Duke of Leeds, as a neutral, who\r\nwould be little more than a figure-head. This precious scheme, chiefly,\r\nat least, set on foot by Loughborough in the hope of gaining the\r\nchancellorship, was debated among them for weeks. Loughborough, who was\r\nnot a man to be trusted, led them to believe that some of Pitt's\r\nconfidential friends were in favour of it, and had assured him that Pitt\r\nwould readily agree to it. Fox approved of the idea of coalition if he\r\nwas to have an equal share with Pitt of power and patronage. Leeds\r\nmentioned the idea of a coalition to the king, who received it coldly,\r\nfor George hated Fox; he did not intend to alter his government to suit\r\nthe whig leaders, and he knew that they were mistaken as regards Pitt's\r\nattitude. At last Leeds spoke of the scheme to Pitt who drily told him\r\nthat circumstances did not call for any alteration in the government and\r\nthat no new arrangement had ever been in contemplation.[231] If the\r\nPortland whigs were to separate themselves from Fox and his friends and\r\nwere to support the government, they would have to support the\r\ngovernment of Pitt, and that after a while, as we shall see, they\r\nresolved to do.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1792 war between France and Austria and Prussia seemed at hand.\r\nThe French ministers hoped to obtain an alliance with England, or at the\r\nleast an assurance of neutrality in case of an invasion of the\r\nNetherlands, and to arrange a loan. They were prepared to offer Tobago\r\nand even Mauritius to boot. Talleyrand, the ex-Bishop of Autun, came\r\nover in an unofficial capacity to see how matters stood and to intrigue\r\nwith the opposition. At court the king treated him coldly and the queen\r\nturned her back on him. He had interviews with Pitt and Grenville, and\r\ngot nothing out of them; he received much attention from the opposition\r\nand returned to France in March. Meanwhile, on February 7, Leopold,\r\nunable to disregard the call of the diet and uneasy about the\r\nNetherlands, agreed with Frederick William to restore order in France,\r\nboth allies intending to be indemnified. Yet war did not come at once,\r\nand on March 1 Leopold died. His son and successor, Francis II., was\r\nless distrustful of Prussia, and was eager for war. Under the influence\r\nof a party, somewhat later known as the Girondists, the French assembly\r\nwas brought to desire war with Austria. On the accession of this party\r\nto power Dumouriez became minister of foreign affairs. He designed to\r\ndetach Prussia from the Austrian alliance, isolate Austria, invade the\r\nAustrian Netherlands, where the people seemed ready for revolt, and\r\nestablish them as an independent republic, and prosecute further plans\r\nfor the extension of France to its \"natural barriers\". Gustavus was\r\nassassinated, and Sweden adopted a neutral policy; Russia, though\r\nviolently hostile, was engaged in Poland, England decided the policy of\r\nSpain and would be followed by Holland. Would England oppose an invasion\r\nof the Netherlands on the understanding that France would not conquer\r\nthem for herself; could the government be persuaded to an alliance by\r\noffers of Tobago, a mutual guarantee of possessions, and a treaty of\r\ncommerce; and could a loan be arranged? Negotiation on these points was\r\nentrusted to Talleyrand who was to accompany Chauvelin, the accredited\r\nambassador, to England.[232] On April 20 France declared war on the\r\n\"King of Hungary and Bohemia,\" as Francis was entitled before his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SEDITIOUS PUBLICATIONS._]\r\n\r\nWhile England's official relations with France remained friendly,\r\ndislike of the revolution was growing stronger, and the more moderate\r\nwhigs were changing their opinions with regard to it. This change was\r\nlargely due to the active propagation of revolutionary ideas among the\r\nlower classes, which was carried on by various societies. The Friends of\r\nthe People, a respectable association of the more extreme whigs,\r\nexcluding Fox, who would not join it, was formed in the spring of 1792\r\nto promote parliamentary reform; some of its proceedings were\r\ndiscreditable, but it kept clear of connexion with the French\r\nrevolutionists. Not so the Revolution Society, the Society for\r\nConstitutional Information, and the London Correspondence Society, which\r\nwere in correspondence with the jacobins of Paris. The last, the most\r\nformidable of them, was directed by a secret council, and had branches\r\nin various large towns, the Sheffield branch alone numbering 2,400\r\nmembers. Meetings were held in which the most violent revolutionary\r\nsentiments were loudly applauded, and seditious handbills and pamphlets,\r\nchief among them the second part of Paine's _Rights of Man_, were\r\ndistributed by tens of thousands. Though the number of persons who\r\nadopted revolutionary ideas was as yet comparatively small, the\r\npropaganda was carried on noisily, and was certainly gaining ground. The\r\ngovernment saw that it was time to interfere, and, on May 21, issued a\r\nroyal proclamation against seditious writings. The address to the crown\r\nin answer to the proclamation was opposed in the commons by Grey. Fox\r\nsupported him, and declared that the proclamation was merely a move\r\ntaken by the government to divide the \"whig interest,\" which, he said,\r\nnothing could divide. Nevertheless Windham and others of Fox's party\r\nsupported the government, and the address was carried without a\r\ndivision. Proceedings were taken against Paine by the attorney-general;\r\nhe fled to France and became a member of the convention. For a time the\r\npropaganda was checked.\r\n\r\nThe feeling which it excited strengthened the government. Acting in\r\nconnexion with the Society of the Friends of the People, Grey gave\r\nnotice of a motion for a reform of parliament. Pitt said that it was\r\n\"not a time to make hazardous experiments\"; and though Fox, Erskine, and\r\nSheridan spoke on the other side, he was supported by the larger number\r\nof the party. Pitt was delighted at this split, and hoped to obtain a\r\npledge of co-operation against the propaganda from \"the most respectable\r\nmembers of opposition\".[233] Matters were not ripe for this. An attempt\r\nof Fox to procure the relief of the unitarians from penal laws was\r\ndefeated by a large majority, owing to the active part which they were\r\ntaking in spreading principles subversive, so Pitt said, \"of every\r\nestablished religion and every established government\". Chauvelin and\r\nTalleyrand found themselves avoided by society generally. They held\r\nconstant communication with Fox, Sheridan, Lord Lansdowne, and other\r\nenemies of the government; and Chauvelin had the impertinence to send a\r\nremonstrance to Grenville against the proclamation of May 21, for which\r\nhe was duly rebuked. All that they could obtain from Grenville was an\r\nassurance that England desired to remain at peace with France, and hoped\r\nthat France would respect the rights of the king and his allies; if, in\r\nother words, the French wished England to remain neutral, they must keep\r\ntheir hands off Holland. No better success attended the effort to detach\r\nPrussia from the Austrian alliance, and the Prussian king declared\r\nhimself at war with France.\r\n\r\nAn attempt of the French to snatch the Austrian Netherlands ended\r\nmiserably; their soldiers fled before the emperor's army of occupation\r\non April 29, mutinied, and murdered one of their generals. The allied\r\narmies under the Duke of Brunswick were gathering, and Paris was in a\r\nferment. Neither of the two national assemblies, not the first, called\r\nthe constituent, nor its successor, the legislative assembly, could\r\ngovern. The Paris mob, bestial and sanguinary, was supreme, and was\r\nmoved from time to time to violent action by individuals or groups which\r\nplayed upon and pandered to its passions. On June 20 a carefully\r\nengineered insurrection exposed the king and queen to cruel insults and\r\nimminent danger. The long agony of the monarchy was drawing to a close.\r\nAfter protracted delays the allies began to move, and, on July 25,\r\nBrunswick published an ill-judged manifesto which excited the French to\r\nfury. The British ambassador, Lord Gower, wrote that the lives of the\r\nking and queen were threatened, and asked if he might represent the\r\nsentiments of his court. Determined not to give any cause of offence,\r\nthe government refused to allow him to speak officially. On August 10\r\nanother prearranged insurrection was raised in Paris; the king and queen\r\nsought refuge with the assembly, and the king's Swiss guards and\r\nofficers were massacred. He and the queen were imprisoned, and royalty\r\nwas \"suspended\". Gower was at once recalled. This was not a hostile act;\r\nthe king to whom he was accredited no longer reigned, and to have\r\naccredited him to the provisional government, which had deposed the\r\nking, would have been indecent and a just cause of offence to the allied\r\npowers. Before leaving he was instructed to express his master's\r\ndetermination to remain neutral, and his earnest hope that the king and\r\nqueen would be safe from any violence, \"which could not fail to produce\r\none universal sentiment of indignation throughout every country of\r\nEurope\". Talleyrand left England; Chauvelin remained, though the king's\r\ndeposition deprived him of his character as ambassador.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FRENCH CONQUESTS._]\r\n\r\nThe allied armies entered France; Longwy surrendered on the 26th and\r\nVerdun on the 31st. A few days later England was horrified by the news\r\nof the massacres of September; the indignation was general, and Fox\r\nspoke of the massacres with genuine disgust. The success of the allies\r\nwas short-lived; Dumouriez defeated the Prussians at Valmy on September\r\n20, and before the end of October the invaders were forced to evacuate\r\nFrance. A French army seized Savoy and Nice, which were annexed to\r\nFrance, and another overran the principalities on the left bank of the\r\nRhine, receiving the surrenders of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz, crossed the\r\nriver and took Frankfort. Meanwhile Dumouriez entered the Austrian\r\nNetherlands; he defeated the Austrians at Jemappes, and the Netherlands\r\nwere lost to the emperor. Everywhere the French posed as liberators and\r\nset up republican institutions. While France was allured by the\r\nGirondist idea of universal emancipation, it carried on the traditions\r\nof the old monarchy in its aggressions; it was so in the Rhineland and\r\nthe Netherlands, and it was so with regard to the Dutch republic. French\r\nrepublicanism was industriously propagated in the provinces, and the\r\n\"patriot\" party, which was defeated in 1787, was again encouraged to\r\nrevolt. Determined not to be drawn into war, the British government, in\r\nJuly, warned the states-general not to be persuaded to join the allies,\r\nand the Dutch remained neutral. In November, a victorious French army\r\nwas on their border, and a strong party among them was ready to\r\nco-operate with it by overthrowing the stadholder as soon as it entered\r\ntheir territory. England was bound alike by honour and her own interest\r\nto defend the stadholder, and the French knew that, if they desired that\r\nEngland should remain neutral, they must not molest Holland. On the\r\n13th the states-general applied to England for an assurance of help if\r\nneed arose. It was, Pitt felt, \"absolutely impossible to hesitate,\" and\r\nGrenville assured the states-general that England would faithfully\r\nfulfil the stipulations of the treaty of 1788.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FRENCH PROVOCATIONS._]\r\n\r\nHolland was in imminent danger, and in the hope that some combined\r\naction might lead to a general pacification, the English government\r\nsought to open confidential communications with Austria and Prussia. The\r\nreplies of the two powers were delayed; they were arranging for their\r\nrespective indemnifications; for their plans were upset by the failure\r\nof their invasion of France. Catherine had invaded Poland in the spring,\r\nand Frederick William, who had more than once guaranteed the integrity\r\nof the kingdom, betrayed the Poles, and agreed with the empress to make\r\na second partition of Poland between themselves. That was to be his\r\nindemnity; the emperor was to be gratified by being allowed to exchange\r\nthe Netherlands for Bavaria. Great Britain protested, but in vain. The\r\nsecond partition of Poland was carried out in 1793. Scarcely had\r\nGrenville assured the Dutch that England would stand by them, when, on\r\nthe 16th, the French executive declared the Scheldt open, and soon\r\nafterwards sent ships of war by it to Antwerp. This decree violated the\r\nrights of the Dutch, which had been confirmed by the treaty of\r\nFontainebleau in 1785, and which England was bound to defend by the\r\ntreaty of 1788. It showed that France assumed the right of subverting\r\nthe political system of Europe by setting treaties at nought, and it was\r\na direct defiance of England.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only provocation which England received. The downfall\r\nof the French monarchy excited the revolutionary societies to fresh\r\nactivity, and the propaganda was carried on with amazing insolence.\r\nDeputations from these societies appeared before the national convention\r\nwith congratulatory addresses and were received with effusion. The\r\nconstitutional society, for example, hoped that Frenchmen would soon\r\nhave to congratulate an English national convention, and the president\r\nin reply expressed his belief that France would soon hail England as a\r\nsister-republic. Emissaries from the French ministry promoted sedition\r\nboth in England and in Ireland, and their reports led their employers to\r\nbelieve that England, Scotland, and Ireland were ripe for revolt.[234]\r\nIt was an absurd mistake. Yet though the number of revolutionists was\r\nstill comparatively small, the propaganda caused much uneasiness.\r\nThousands of French refugees were landing in England, mostly priests and\r\nmembers of the aristocracy, many of them completely destitute.\r\nSubscriptions were raised for their relief, and Burke and others exerted\r\nthemselves nobly in their behalf. This large immigration made it easy\r\nfor French spies and revolutionary agents to carry on their work\r\nundetected. Its progress was helped forward by discontent among the\r\nlower class. The harvest was bad and the price of wheat rose, trade was\r\ndepressed, and there was much distress, specially in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts. Riots broke out at Carlisle, Leeds, Yarmouth, Shields, Leith,\r\nPerth, and Dundee, and in some cases were connected with revolutionary\r\nsentiments. At Dundee cries were raised of \"No excise, no king,\" and a\r\ntree of liberty was planted. On November 19 the convention openly\r\nasserted its right to overthrow the government of other countries by\r\ndecreeing that France would help, and would instruct her generals to\r\nhelp, all peoples that desired freedom; and an order was given that\r\ntranslations of this decree should be distributed in all countries. The\r\ndecree was an invitation to the subjects of every state in Europe to\r\nrevolt, and the propaganda which it authorised was a gross insult to the\r\nBritish government and nation.\r\n\r\nThe danger of Holland and the activity of revolutionists at home\r\nconvinced the ministry that it was time to take measures of defence. On\r\nDecember 1 a part of the militia was embodied, and parliament was\r\nsummoned for the 13th; the Tower was fortified, naval preparations were\r\nset on foot, a squadron was ordered to the mouth of the Scheldt, and an\r\norder of council prohibited the exportation of grain to France.\r\nGrenville informed the Dutch that England was arming, and called on them\r\nto arm also. Pitt still hoped for peace, and suggested to a French envoy\r\nthat his government should give him assurances through an authorised\r\nagent with respect to the safety of Holland and the decree of November\r\n19. The executive council would only treat through Chauvelin, who was\r\noffensive.[235] On the 27th he demanded whether England was to be\r\nreckoned neutral or an enemy of France; he protested that the decree did\r\nnot apply to England, and that no attack would be made on Holland, but\r\nsaid that France would not give way as to the Scheldt, and threatened\r\nthat if the ministers decided on war, they would find the nation against\r\nthem. Already a decree of the convention passed on the 15th had ordained\r\nthat all states occupied by French armies should virtually be subject to\r\nFrance, and should contribute to the support of the French troops. The\r\nwar of \"liberation\" had become a war of conquest.[236] Grenville replied\r\nto Chauvelin on the 31st to the effect that the protestations of the\r\nexecutive council were belied by its conduct, that England could not\r\nconsent that France should annul treaties at her pleasure, or be\r\nindifferent to her assumption of sovereignty over the Netherlands, and\r\nthat if she desired England's friendship, she should abandon her views\r\nof aggression and cease to insult or disturb other governments.[237]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISRUPTION OF THE WHIG PARTY._]\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of the session Pitt was absent; he had at the\r\nking's earnest wish accepted the valuable sinecure office of warden of\r\nthe Cinque Ports, and was not yet re-elected. In moving an amendment to\r\nthe address on the 14th Fox made a violent attack on the government. At\r\nthat critical time when England's welfare demanded that party enmities\r\nshould yield before the importance of union against sedition at home and\r\naggression abroad, he did not scruple to declare that the government had\r\nwilfully exaggerated domestic disturbances, in order to establish a\r\nsystem of oppression more intolerable than \"the horrors of the\r\ninquisition of Spain,\" and implied that the ministers were hostile to\r\nFrance merely because France was, as he jeeringly said, \"an unanointed\r\nrepublic\". Windham and other whigs voted against him, and his amendment\r\nwas rejected by 290 to 50. He returned to the charge, but spoke more\r\nmoderately, on the next day and again on the next, with a motion for\r\nsending an ambassador to Paris, which was negatived without a division.\r\nThe disruption of the whig party was obvious; Portland, Fitzwilliam,\r\nSpencer, Carlisle, and Loughborough in the lords, and in the commons\r\nWindham, Elliot, and many more voted with the government, and Burke took\r\nhis seat on the treasury bench. Loughborough received the great seal on\r\nJanuary 28, 1793, but the rest as yet gave the ministers independent\r\nsupport. An addition of 9,000 men to the naval force and increased army\r\nestimates were voted unanimously, Fox declaring his approval on the\r\nground that the position of foreign affairs demanded them. An alien bill\r\nwas also carried, subjecting foreign immigrants to police regulations\r\nand empowering the secretary of state to expel them. This bill was\r\nopposed in the lords by Lansdowne, and in the commons by Fox and Grey.\r\nIn the course of an almost frenzied speech in support of it, Burke threw\r\na dagger on the floor of the house, a specimen, he said, of three\r\nthousand which, he was informed on excellent authority, had been ordered\r\nin Birmingham by an English revolutionist.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, whose credentials as \"minister plenipotentiary of the French\r\nrepublic\" were not accepted by the English court protested against the\r\nalien bill and the prohibition of the export of grain, and declared that\r\nFrance considered the treaty of commerce of 1786 broken and annulled.\r\nThe two measures excited the indignation of the convention; the speedy\r\ndownfall of England was triumphantly predicted; 3,000,000 Irishmen were\r\nready to revolt, and India would shake off the British rule as soon as\r\nthe French appeared in Asia. The executive council was pressed to demand\r\nthe repeal of both measures, and a satisfactory explanation of the\r\nEnglish military preparations, and orders were given for the immediate\r\narmament of a fleet. While the French ministers were already preparing\r\nfor a descent on England,[238] and France was reducing the Austrian\r\nNetherlands to a merely municipal status, the contemplated invasion of\r\nHolland was delayed by the condition of the French army; and\r\nnegotiations with England were carried on. Believing that if the English\r\npeople were assured with respect to the Netherlands and the intention of\r\nFrance not to interfere in their domestic concerns, they would declare\r\nagainst the government in case of a war, the French foreign minister\r\nprotested that the occupation of the Netherlands was merely temporary,\r\nthat France looked forward to Belgian independence, and that the decree\r\nof November 19 only applied to a case where the general will of the\r\npeople was expressed. The opening of the Scheldt was defended as\r\nauthorised by the law of nature. This paper, which was a kind of\r\nultimatum, did not withdraw the claim to propagate republicanism in\r\nother states or to annul the treaty rights of England's allies, and put\r\nno definite limit to the occupation of the Austrian Netherlands.\r\nGrenville returned a haughty answer. War was almost certain. The\r\nexecution of the French king on the 21st hastened the end. The tidings\r\nwere received in London with universal grief and indignation; the\r\ntheatres were closed, and not the court alone, but all who could afford\r\nit, wore mourning. As the king drove through the streets, cries were\r\nraised of \"War with France!\" Chauvelin was ordered to quit the kingdom\r\nin eight days, and left at once. On February 1 France declared war on\r\nEngland and Holland. In common with the nation at large, George welcomed\r\nthe declaration of war; the \"insolence\" of France irritated him, and the\r\nexecution of the French king was an insult and a menace to every crowned\r\nhead in Europe; yet the order of the king in council for Chauvelin's\r\ndeparture was of course given on the advice of the ministers.[239]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WAR WITH FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nPitt had striven long and earnestly to avoid war. It was finally forced\r\nupon him. Grossly as the government was provoked by French attempts to\r\nspread republicanism in the king's dominions, that alone would not have\r\nforced him into war; the great mass of the English people was thoroughly\r\nloyal, and the resources of government were sufficient to deal with\r\nsedition. But England was bound in honour to defend the rights of the\r\nDutch, and her own security demanded that she should withstand the\r\nFrench designs of aggrandisement. Burke would have had war declared on\r\nFrance as an enemy of God and mankind, because she trampled on\r\ninstitutions which he regarded as sacred in themselves and essential to\r\nthe well-being of society. The feelings of the nation were excited by\r\nthe excesses of the revolution, until the crowning act of the king's\r\nexecution called forth a demand for war; and as the war went on hatred\r\nof French principles made Englishmen willing to bear the heavy burdens\r\nit entailed. But in the great decision Pitt was unmoved by sentiments\r\nsuch as these. Unlike the rulers of Austria and Prussia, the government\r\nwas not embarking on a war either of principles or ambition, not on a\r\ncrusade against republicanism nor, in its inception, a struggle for\r\nextended dominions; its object was to maintain the honour and the\r\nsecurity of England. The opening of the Scheldt by France was a far more\r\nserious matter for England than if Leopold II. had succeeded in his\r\nattempt to carry out the same measure; for France was a great maritime\r\npower and entertained schemes of boundless ambition. That she\r\ncontemplated the annexation of the Austrian Netherlands and the conquest\r\nof Holland was certain, and if she became mistress of the Netherlands\r\nand Holland, and had Antwerp as a station for her fleet, the security of\r\nEngland would be at an end.\r\n\r\nSecurity could only be attained either by war or by an alliance with the\r\nrepublic, which would have been repugnant to the nation, would have made\r\nEngland partner in unjustifiable aggressions, and would have betrayed\r\nthe interests of Europe to France. While it may be urged that the\r\nhaughty tone adopted by Grenville during the last few weeks of peace\r\nirritated France, and that the dismissal of Chauvelin put an end to\r\nfurther attempts at reconciliation, it will scarcely be denied that the\r\ngovernment was justified in refusing to prolong useless communications,\r\nand that it acted wisely in taking a decided step when the country was\r\nthoroughly prepared to support its decision. Having to choose between\r\nwar and all that an alliance with France would have entailed, England\r\nchose war, and took her stand in the breach which France made in the\r\npolitical system, true to herself and finally the saviour of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe violent opposition of Fox seems to have proceeded from mixed causes.\r\nThat he sincerely loved liberty must be allowed, but he was less\r\nattracted by the constitutional liberty of Burke's devotion, which like\r\nsome stately building grows towards completeness as each successive\r\ngeneration enters into and carries on the labours of its predecessors,\r\nthan by the cause of liberty, whether truly or falsely so called, in\r\nrevolt. Unbridled in his own life, he loved resistance to authority. And\r\nhe was one of those, in England unfortunately there are always such, who\r\nrate the cause they love above their country's cause. It was so with\r\nhim during the American war. When he would describe how much an event\r\npleased him he wrote, \"no public event, not excepting Saratoga and\r\nYorktown, ever gave me so much delight\". It was so during the war with\r\nFrance. His opposition, however, also proceeded from hatred to the\r\ngovernment.[240] Abhorred by the king and rejected by the country, he\r\nresented his exclusion from office by opposing the government at a time\r\nwhen Englishmen should have sunk all party differences in the face of\r\ntheir country's peril. He ascribed the measures taken to repress\r\nsedition and defeat the French propaganda as attempts at tyranny. While\r\nhe acknowledged that the opening of the Scheldt was a _casus belli_, he\r\nspoke of it as a matter which England could well afford to overlook, and\r\nhe represented the action of the government as unfair to France and as\r\nthe result of monarchical prejudice. As the war went on his unpatriotic\r\nfeelings were constantly displayed in a most offensive manner. His\r\nconduct broke up the whig party. England was entering on a period of\r\nfearful conflict; happy at least in that the confidence of the nation\r\nwas given to a statesman whose one absorbing care was for the welfare of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[229] _Political Memoranda of the Duke of Leeds_, pp. 150-52; Lecky,\r\n_Hist._, v., 222-99.\r\n\r\n[230] Sorel, _L'Europe et la Revolution Francaise_, ii., 236.\r\n\r\n[231] _Political Memoranda of the Duke of Leeds_, p. 194.\r\n\r\n[232] Sorel, _u.s._, ii., 417-23.\r\n\r\n[233] _Auckland Corr._, ii., 401-3.\r\n\r\n[234] Sorel, _u.s._, iii., 214-15.\r\n\r\n[235] _Ibid._, 221-22, 225, 229.\r\n\r\n[236] Sorel, _u.s._, iii., 235-37, 259; Sybel, _Geschichte der\r\nRevolutionzeit_, French trans. _Histoire de l'Europe pendant la\r\nRevolution Francaise_, ii., 58-60.\r\n\r\n[237] Correspondence between M.

All progress in these directions was arrested\r\nby the war. The security of England, a matter of higher importance than\r\nthese, was at stake. The war demanded all the energies of the nation.\r\nQuestions which would have divided the country or weakened the\r\ngovernment were shelved, for it was not a time to debate reforms when\r\nthe state itself was in peril. Pitt defeated efforts for parliamentary\r\nreform and grew cold to the cause of the abolition of the slave trade.\r\nBut the war brought worse than an arrest of progress; it brought\r\nrepression of freedom and a tremendous load of debt. The French\r\npropaganda roused general indignation and alarm. Towards the end of 1792\r\nthe ministers were convinced of the existence of a plot for effecting a\r\nrevolution by the aid of France. There was much to justify their alarm;\r\nIreland seemed ripe for revolt, political discontent was strong in\r\nScotland, and evidence, gained later, confirmed them in their belief\r\nthat sedition was reaching a dangerous height in England. They overrated\r\nthe existing danger, though if sedition had remained unchecked it might\r\nsoon have become dangerous; for France was attacking the state by secret\r\nseduction as well as by open arms. Extraordinary precautions were taken\r\nto meet a peril which was specially terrible because its extent was\r\nunknown. Measures of repression were eagerly welcomed by parliament;\r\njudges and magistrates exercised their powers with harshness, and juries\r\nwere often biassed by the feeling of the bench. The nation was alarmed,\r\nand severity was popular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT AS A WAR MINISTER._]\r\n\r\nPitt, who had guided England in peace, was to remain at the helm in\r\nwar. The conduct of the war is therefore closely connected with the\r\nquestion whether, great as he was in peace, he was a great war\r\nminister.[241] The British army, which in 1792 only numbered about\r\n17,300 men and at the outbreak of the war was increased by 9,945, was so\r\nsmall that it could only either act a secondary part in a continental\r\nwar, or engage in isolated expeditions to support insurrections in\r\nFrance. During the first part of the war our successes on land were\r\ntrifling and our failures many. This was partly at least due to the\r\ncustom of regarding noble birth rather than military attainments as a\r\nclaim to command. Though Pitt, as we shall see, insisted on the recall\r\nof the Duke of York, he did not break through this evil custom, and our\r\ngenerals, though brave, were often incompetent. Pitt built great hopes\r\non the co-operation of the French royalists and many expeditions were\r\nsent out to act with them. A belligerent power should place little\r\ndependence on insurrectionary movements in an enemy's country; for\r\ninsurgents, however hostile they may be to their own government, will\r\nseldom act cordially with a foreign invader; their forces are generally\r\nunorganised, and they are apt to expect too much of their foreign ally.\r\nIt is good policy to encourage them by sending them supplies, for their\r\nrevolts embarrass their government and are useful as diversions in war.\r\nBut a belligerent should not squander on diversions strength which might\r\nbe employed in the main conflict. Pitt's expeditions of this kind were\r\ncostly failures; they inflicted no deadly wound and were expensive both\r\nin men and money. On the other hand England was victorious by sea; the\r\nnaval force was raised to 45,000 men in February, 1793, was constantly\r\nincreased, and was commanded by admirals whose right to command was\r\nbased on their skill in seamanship and maritime warfare.\r\n\r\nFor the security of England and the peace of Europe France, it was held,\r\nmust be reduced to powerlessness. England's greatness at sea might\r\nenable her to destroy the enemy's commerce, conquer her colonies, and\r\nblockade her ports; the object of the war could be attained only by\r\nvictories on land. Politically the continental states were rotten; their\r\nrulers were selfish despots, each bent on extending his dominions by\r\nany means, however dishonest; for international morality had broken\r\ndown before the bait offered by the weakness of Poland. What barrier\r\ncould they oppose to the flood of French aggression, the outcome of the\r\nenthusiasm of a great people? When France forced England into war she\r\nprovoked a more dangerous enemy--the will of a nation. Supported by the\r\nnational will, Pitt embarked on the task of combining the powers of\r\nEurope against France, and as some were unwilling and some unable to\r\nfight at their own expense, he paid them with English gold, and England\r\nfound money for them as well as for her own naval and military\r\noperations. Pitt raised enormous loans. The funded debt, which in 1792\r\nwas, roughly, L238,000,000, rose during nine years of war to about\r\nL574,000,000. He began to borrow at once; in 1793 he raised a loan of\r\nL4,500,000, and in 1794 another of L11,000,000, besides imposing new\r\ntaxes amounting to L913,000.\r\n\r\nHe has been blamed for not raising more by taxation during the early\r\nyears of the war instead of burdening posterity so heavily. The\r\nfinancial difficulties of France led him to believe that the war would\r\nbe short. \"It will be a short war,\" he said, \"and certainly ended in one\r\nor two campaigns.\" \"No, sir,\" replied the more prescient Burke, \"it will\r\nbe a long war and a dangerous war; but it must be undertaken.\" In its\r\nearliest years Pitt had good reason for avoiding high taxation. It began\r\nin the midst of a financial crisis. The harvest of 1792 was seriously\r\ndefective, and there was much want. The rapid advance in agriculture,\r\ncommerce, and manufactures had led to the foundation of many country\r\nbanks, which eagerly pushed their own notes into circulation, and credit\r\nwas unduly strained. Currency became redundant, and a violent revulsion\r\nbegan in November, 1792, when the number of bankruptcies in the month\r\namounted to 105, more than double the average number of the ten earlier\r\nmonths of the year. The crisis became more acute in the spring of 1793,\r\nand during the year there were 1,926 failures, of which twenty-six were\r\nfailures of country banks. In order to relieve the distress Pitt, in\r\nApril, obtained the assent of parliament for the issue of exchequer\r\nbills to the extent of L5,000,000 to be applied in advances at fair\r\ninterest and on good security. Fox offered a factious opposition to this\r\nmeasure, alleging that it conferred a dangerous power on the executive.\r\nIt was completely successful, and the panic was checked. As, then, Pitt\r\nbelieved that the war would be short, and as it was not a time for\r\nattempting to raise taxation to an amount sufficient to furnish the\r\nsupplies within the year, he was justified in having an early recourse\r\nto loans.\r\n\r\nIn return for the L336,000,000 of debt created by Pitt in nine years,\r\nthe country only received about L223,000,000 in money; and he has been\r\naccused of extravagance because he raised money mainly in 3 per cent.\r\nstock instead of at a rate more nearly corresponding to its market\r\nvalue. In 1793 every L100 borrowed created L138 stock, and when in 1797\r\nthe 3 per cents. fell to 47, the sacrifice was enormous. Pitt did\r\nattempt to raise a loan at a higher rate in 1793, and found it\r\nimpossible; and it is at least doubtful whether he did not act more\r\nprudently in borrowing in the 3 per cents. than at a high rate.[242] In\r\nhis budget speech of 1793 he announced that he would always maintain the\r\nsinking fund. He kept his promise, and this expensive economy provided a\r\ndeduction of L42,500,000 from the L336,000,000 of debt. Financially, as\r\nwe have seen, this was a mistake; politically it was useful in\r\nencouraging and comforting the country in a time of stress; for the\r\nopposition was as fully persuaded as the ministry of the efficacy of the\r\nfund. If, then, it be allowed that the war was just and necessary,\r\nlittle fault should be found with the way in which money was provided\r\nfor it. That Pitt's subsidies were sometimes unwise may be conceded;\r\nthat his coalitions disappointed him is certain. He had to contend with\r\nselfishness and deceit in the rulers of Europe, and laboured with\r\nability and courage to keep them steadfast to the common cause, again\r\nand again taking up his task, undismayed by failures which are not to be\r\nlaid to his charge. While mistakes in the conduct of the war forbid us\r\nto call him a great war minister in the narrow sense of the term, we\r\nshould scarcely refuse that praise in a wider, truer sense to a minister\r\nso dauntless in adversity, so fertile in resource, so deservedly trusted\r\nby the nation as \"the pilot that weathered the storm\".\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE COALITION FORMED._]\r\n\r\nIn March the government hired troops from Hanover and Hesse Cassel; and\r\nduring the year, Holland being already an ally, made treaties hostile\r\nto France with all the other Christian powers of Europe except Denmark,\r\nSweden, the Swiss, Tuscany Venice, and Genoa, which decided on\r\nneutrality. The emperor and the Prussian king agreed to carry on the war\r\nin concert with England. Catherine of Russia made a treaty of commerce,\r\nand another promising co-operation against the commerce of France. Her\r\narmy was engaged in Poland, and she took no part in the war beyond\r\ncarrying out her engagement by means of her fleet. In May, the\r\nconvention declared war on Spain and the king entered into the\r\ncoalition. The King of Sardinia was already at war, and the British\r\ngovernment granted him a subsidy of L200,000 to enable him to keep up\r\nhis army, and agreed to send a fleet into the Mediterranean. A treaty\r\nfor concerted action in the Mediterranean was made with the king of the\r\nTwo Sicilies, and another treaty with Portugal, our ancient ally, which\r\nbecame of importance after Spain deserted the coalition. The accession\r\nof England to the enemies of France gave them a new weapon against her.\r\nGreat Britain and Russia agreed to prevent neutral ships from supplying\r\nher with provisions, and, on June 8, British officers were ordered to\r\nstop all ships so engaged and send them to England, where their cargoes\r\nwould be sold and their freights paid by the government.\r\n\r\nThe emperor did not relish the idea of a disinterested war; and\r\nGrenville agreed that the allies should indemnify themselves, and should\r\nmake conquests on the Belgian frontier of France, which in Austrian\r\nhands would form a strong barrier against her. This met the emperor's\r\nviews, for an enlargement of the Austrian Netherlands would forward his\r\nplan of exchanging them for Bavaria. The proposed exchange, however, was\r\ncontrary to English policy, for it would have created a weak state on\r\nthe French frontier. As soon as war was declared, Dumouriez invaded\r\nHolland, but was soon called back to Belgium, where the French were\r\nlosing ground. He was defeated at Neerwinden on March 18, and the French\r\nwithdrew from the Netherlands. They were unsuccessful on the Rhine, and\r\nMainz was threatened by the Prussians. Dissatisfied with the proceedings\r\nof his government, Dumouriez intrigued with the enemy and finally fled\r\nto the Austrian camp, but was unable to carry his army with him. On\r\nApril 8 a conference between representatives of the allies was held at\r\nAntwerp. Lord Auckland, the British minister in Holland, appeared for\r\nEngland, accompanied by the king's second son, the Duke of York, who was\r\nto command the British and Hanoverian army. The allies agreed to make\r\nconquests and keep them. Auckland declared that this was the policy of\r\nhis court. Austria was to gain places on the frontier which would shut\r\nFrance out from the Netherlands, England would look to the conquest of\r\nDunkirk and the French colonies.[243]\r\n\r\nOn May 20 the British army with its Hanoverian and Hessian contingents\r\njoined the Prince of Coburg, and took a distinguished part in driving\r\nthe French from their camp at Famars. The smart appearance of the\r\nEnglish troops was much admired, but their officers were careless. The\r\nFrench army of the north was disorderly and discouraged. While the\r\nregular troops generally behaved well, the volunteers, who had a\r\nseparate organisation and elected their own officers, were insubordinate\r\nand lacking in soldierly qualities; the representatives of the people\r\nwho accompanied the army, though they did some good, meddled in military\r\nmatters; the generals were suspected, were constantly displaced, and\r\nwere fortunate if they escaped the scaffold; and the ministry of war was\r\nutterly incompetent. The allies besieged Conde and Valenciennes; Conde\r\nsurrendered on July 13 and Valenciennes on the 28th, and the Austrians\r\ntook possession of both. Coburg's allies were anxious to secure\r\nterritory for themselves, and he had some difficulty in persuading them\r\nto join him in an attack on the French at Caesar's camp, a strong\r\nposition covered by the Scheldt, the Sensee, and the Agache. The French\r\nwere driven out and fell back on Arras. France was in sore straits.\r\nMainz capitulated on July 23, and the army of the Moselle retreated\r\nbehind the Saar. On the Spanish frontier Roussillon was invaded. In the\r\nAlps the republican army was driven back near Saorgio, and its best\r\ntroops were sent off to quell insurrection in the cities of the south;\r\nfor the country was torn by civil discord. The Girondins were overthrown\r\nin June, and the party called the Mountain gained absolute power.\r\nBordeaux was a centre of resistance; Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon were\r\nin revolt, and were supported by the towns of the Jura and Provence. An\r\ninsurrection which began in the Vendean district of Anjou grew to a\r\nformidable height. The army of La Vendee, of 40,000 men, defeated the\r\nrepublican generals, captured Saumur, and threatened Nantes. Between\r\nBasle and the sea the allies were 280,000 strong; an advance on Paris in\r\ntwo directions, from the Belgian border by Soissons and from Mainz by\r\nReims, would almost certainly have ended the war. After the capture of\r\nCaesar's camp the way to Paris lay open to Coburg; there was no French\r\nforce strong enough to arrest the march of the allies.[244]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISCORDANT AIMS OF THE ALLIES._]\r\n\r\nThe coalition was paralysed by discord and by the insistence of its\r\nmembers on the pursuit of different objects. The English ministers made\r\nthe security of the Netherlands as an Austrian province a prime\r\nconsideration, and to satisfy them the emperor promised to give up the\r\nexchange of the Netherlands for Bavaria. He was to be indemnified by the\r\nacquisition of Alsace and Lorraine, which were to be conquered by the\r\nhelp of Prussia.[245] Frederick William, however, would not help to\r\nconquer territory for Austria, nor assist in the dismemberment of\r\nFrance, unless the emperor assented to the treaty for the partition of\r\nPoland secretly arranged between him and Catherine of Russia, and signed\r\non January 23. Baron Thugut, the Austrian minister, who was violently\r\nhostile toward Prussia, would not assent to a treaty which aggrandised\r\nthat power and did not give his master a share in the spoil. While,\r\nthen, France, distressed by invasion, revolt, and scarcity, seemed an\r\neasy prey, Brunswick remained on the Rhine, and refused to co-operate\r\nwith Austria in Alsace, and Coburg was intent on gaining frontier towns.\r\nThe English government was anxious to secure its own share in the\r\nconquests from France, and, on August 10, acting on instructions from\r\nhome, York went off with a force of 37,000 men, his own English and\r\nGerman troops with 11,000 Austrians, to lay siege to Dunkirk. About the\r\nsame time Frederick William ordered 8,000 Prussian troops engaged in\r\nFlanders to withdraw to Luxemburg, and Coburg invested Le Quesnoy.\r\n\r\nOn one side only was full advantage taken of the distress of France. In\r\nconsequence of the late disputes with Spain and Russia the British navy\r\nwas in an efficient state. Of 113 ships of the line nearly ninety were\r\nin good condition. Howe commanded the channel fleet; he kept it at\r\nSpithead, and it did nothing of importance during the year. The\r\nMediterranean fleet under Hood sailed in June and blockaded Toulon. The\r\ninsurrectionary movement at Marseilles was quelled by the convention,\r\nand the royalists at Toulon were threatened by the jacobin forces.\r\nThough the town was well supplied with provisions, the chiefs of the\r\nroyalist party persuaded the people that the only way to escape\r\nstarvation was to treat with the English. The inhabitants declared for\r\nLouis XVII., the son of the late king, and the constitution of 1791, and\r\nsurrendered the town to Hood, together with the ships in the port,\r\nthirty ships of the line, more than a third of the whole French line of\r\nbattle, and other smaller vessels. Hood received the forts and the ships\r\nfor King Louis and promised to restore them at the end of the war. He\r\ninvited the co-operation of the Spanish fleet under Langara and when it\r\nappeared entered the harbour, on August 29. The news was received in\r\nEngland with delight, and Grenville declared his belief that \"the\r\nbusiness at Toulon\" would probably be \"decisive of the war\". England\r\ndesired the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, and it was hoped\r\nthat the occupation of the place would strengthen the movement in that\r\ndirection in the south. The _emigre_ Count of Provence, the next younger\r\nbrother of Louis XVI., who had assumed the title of regent, desired the\r\ngovernment to allow him to enter the town. As the _emigres_ aimed at the\r\nrestoration of absolutism it would have been fatal to the hopes built on\r\nthe movement in the south in favour of a constitutional monarchy to have\r\ngranted his request, and it would have been unfair to the Toulonese who\r\nstipulated for the acceptance of the constitution of 1791. Besides this,\r\nthe _emigres_ were strongly opposed to the policy of conquest adopted at\r\nAntwerp; and, though Toulon was not to be taken from France, England\r\ncould not at that time encourage the count's pretensions. His presence\r\nin the town would have been embarrassing to Hood, and he would certainly\r\nhave interfered with the defence. England did not acknowledge his claim\r\nto the regency, and he was not admitted into Toulon.\r\n\r\nWhile the allies were divided in purpose and action, the danger of\r\nFrance and the violation of her territory roused the party in power to\r\nenergy in her defence. In August the second committee of public safety\r\ndecreed a _levee en masse_, and on the 23rd substituted for it a\r\nuniversal conscription. Men were poured into the army, but they had to\r\nbe turned into soldiers; and efficient generals, and above all a\r\ncompetent military administration, had to be provided. At this crisis\r\nCarnot, who was to earn the title of \"organiser of victories,\" took the\r\ndirection of the war. The new troops were at first worse than useless,\r\nbut after a while they were brought to order by being drafted into the\r\nold battalions; the amalgamation of the volunteers with the regulars was\r\neffected early in 1794, and the army of the revolution became a\r\nwell-ordered fighting machine. While the new levies of August, 1793,\r\nwere still undisciplined Carnot's genius began to raise the fortunes of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HONDSCHOOTE._]\r\n\r\nWhen York marched off to the siege of Dunkirk on August 10 he divided\r\nhis army into two corps, placing one, composed of 14,500 German and\r\nAustrian troops, under Marshal Freytag, to act as an army of\r\nobservation, while he commanded the army of the siege in person. On his\r\nmarch a detachment of his troops surprised and routed a French force at\r\nLinselles while engaged in pillaging the place. He summoned Dunkirk on\r\nthe 23rd. The fleet, which was to have bombarded the town and brought a\r\nsiege-train, had not arrived. He was only able to invest the town on the\r\neast, for the French laid the country between Bergues and Dunkirk under\r\nwater, and the causeway from Bergues was strongly defended. His army\r\noccupied a wretched position, was in want of good water, and was cut off\r\nfrom direct communication with Freytag, who was encamped in front of\r\nBergues.[246] On September 6-8 Freytag's army was attacked by a French\r\narmy under Houchard of nearly four times its strength. Walmoden, who\r\nsucceeded Freytag, might have avoided the battle of Hondschoote on the\r\n8th; he fought in obedience to York's orders and was defeated with heavy\r\nloss. York hastily retreated to Furnes. If Houchard had followed up his\r\nsuccess he might have crushed York's army. He turned aside to attack the\r\nDutch quartered on the Lys and routed them at Menin. Le Quesnoy\r\nsurrendered to the Austrians on the 11th, and Coburg invested Maubeuge.\r\nJourdan, the new commander of the army of the north, and Carnot, who\r\naccompanied him, attacked and defeated the Austrian covering army at\r\nWattignies on October 16, and forced Coburg to raise the siege. This was\r\npractically the end of the campaign, which closed far more favourably\r\nfor France than it had begun.\r\n\r\nOn the German frontier political disunion was fatal to the success of\r\nthe allies. Frederick William believed that the emperor's refusal to\r\naccept the partition treaty encouraged the Poles to resist his demands.\r\nHe left the army of the Rhine, and went off to Posen to establish his\r\nrule in his new dominions, ordering Brunswick not to engage in any\r\noperations which might prevent him from sending him such troops as he\r\nmight call for. Wurmser, the Austrian commander, drove the French from\r\ntheir lines at Weissenburg on October 13, but the limited co-operation\r\nof the Prussian army was not enough to secure any material progress, and\r\nfinally, on December 26, Hoche inflicted a severe defeat on the\r\nAustrians at the Geisberg. Wurmser retreated across the Rhine, and the\r\nPrussians were forced to abandon the greater part of the Palatinate, and\r\nwithdrew to Mainz. No French territory on the north or east remained in\r\nthe hands of the allies except Conde, Valenciennes and Le Quesnoy, while\r\non the Italian frontier forward movements of the Piedmontese had ended\r\nin failure and the King of Sardinia was reduced to a merely defensive\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe republican armies were not less successful against domestic foes\r\nthan against foreign invasion. The loss of Mainz in July set free a\r\nlarge force which was used to lay waste La Vendee. The Vendeans applied\r\nfor help to the emigrant princes and to England. Pitt, though he would\r\nnot encourage the hopes of the princes, was willing to support a\r\nmovement which was weakening the enemy and might forward the\r\nestablishment of a constitutional monarchy. Stores were sent to\r\nNoirmoutier for the insurgents and further help was promised. Some\r\n80,000 Vendeans, of both sexes and all ages, crossed the Loire, marched\r\nthrough Anjou, and made an attempt on Granville, in the hope of gaining\r\na port at which they might receive succour from England. An expedition\r\nwas prepared to help them, and a force of 12,000 men, emigres, British\r\ntroops, and others under the Earl of Moira, the Lord Rawdon of the\r\nAmerican war, arrived off the Norman coast on December 2. They made\r\nsignals but no answer was returned. The Vendeans had failed before\r\nGranville and had retreated a few days before. As they were attempting\r\nto return to their homes they were caught by a republican force; a large\r\nnumber was massacred and the rest dispersed. The English expedition\r\nreturned without accomplishing anything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVACUATION OF TOULON._]\r\n\r\nToulon was threatened by the republicans both on the east and west,\r\nwhile on the north Lyons was closely besieged. Hood despatched Nelson to\r\nNaples for reinforcements which were sent by the king. Even with them\r\nthe garrison, made up of 2,000 British troops, Spaniards, Sardinians,\r\nNeapolitans, and French royalists, many of them untrained, amounted to\r\nonly about 12,000 men fit for duty, a wholly insufficient number, for\r\nthe defences were widely extended. Hood sent off four of the French\r\nships, full of republican prisoners, who were allowed to return to their\r\nhomes because it was inconvenient to keep them. By the middle of\r\nSeptember the republicans were pressing the siege, and on October 1 the\r\ngarrison under Lord Mulgrave smartly drove them from a commanding\r\nposition which they had seized on Mont Faron. The fall of Lyons on the\r\n9th set free a large force to act against the place, and the besieging\r\narmy under Dugommier finally numbered 37,000 men, with artillery\r\norganised and directed by a young Corsican officer, Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nwho since September 16 had taken an active part in the siege. General\r\nO'Hara, then in command in the town, was wounded and taken prisoner\r\nwhile leading a sortie, and on the night of December 16-17 the enemy\r\nforced the line of defence and planted their batteries in commanding\r\npositions. Neither the harbour nor the town was tenable any longer, and\r\norders were given for the embarkation of the troops. Of the twenty-seven\r\nFrench ships of the line in the harbour, nine, together with smaller\r\nvessels, were burnt by British seamen under Sir Sidney Smith, in spite\r\nof a furious bombardment from the heights, and three accompanied the\r\nretreat. The remaining fifteen were left to the enemy, and an attempt to\r\ndestroy the dockyard was only partially successful, for time was short\r\nand the Spaniards, either through treachery or more probably through the\r\nincompetence of their officers, failed to accomplish their share of the\r\nwork. The English and Spanish fleets sailed on the 19th, carrying off\r\nsome 6,000 refugees, and Hood's fleet anchored in Hyeres bay. The\r\nremainder of the population was exposed to the cruel vengeance of the\r\njacobins.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the government did not intend to\r\nviolate the terms of the surrender by keeping Toulon as a British\r\npossession. As an isolated station it could not have been defended and\r\nsupplied without an enormous strain on England's resources. Its value to\r\nGreat Britain was purely temporary; it was of incalculable importance to\r\nthe enemy, and it was expected to serve as a base for the movement in\r\nthe south against the jacobin government. The issue of the insurrection\r\nwas decided by the fall of Lyons. Hopes of a success to be gained\r\nthrough French disaffection were as ill-founded as those based on\r\nAmerican loyalism. The ministers pursued a mistaken policy, and pursued\r\nit weakly; for as they believed that the occupation of Toulon was of\r\nfirst-rate importance, they should have concentrated their efforts upon\r\nits defence instead of squandering their resources by trying to do two\r\nthings at once, to co-operate with the Vendeans and to defend Toulon,\r\nwhile the war on the Flemish frontier was a constant drain on England's\r\nsmall army. Grenville ascribed the disaster to the \"common cause\" to the\r\nfailure of the Austrian government to fulfil its promise of sending a\r\nreinforcement of 5,000 men to the garrison.[247] The loss of the place\r\nwas a bitter disappointment; it was mortifying in itself, and it\r\ndeclared the futility of the high hopes built on the insurrectionary\r\nmovement in the south. Reckoning it with Dunkirk and the Vendean\r\nexpedition, the government had to confess to three failures in the year.\r\nYet England had some grounds for satisfaction. Tobago and the fishery\r\nislands of St. Pierre and Miquelon were taken without difficulty,\r\nPondicherry and the other French factories in India were surrendered,\r\nseveral French ships of war were captured in single-ship and other small\r\ncombats, and a substantial advantage was gained by the destruction of\r\nthe ships at Toulon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSION._]\r\n\r\nThe success of the allies in the spring of 1793 gave Fox an opportunity\r\nfor moving for the re-establishment of peace. If, he argued, the war was\r\nundertaken to preserve Holland and check the aggrandisement of France,\r\nthat object was attained. France had been the aggressor; so much the\r\nmore reason was there to regard the war as purely defensive, and end it\r\nwhen the aggression ended. Pitt said that he would no longer pledge\r\nhimself that England would not interfere in the internal affairs of\r\nFrance. So long as the existing French government was in power, there\r\ncould be no security that the system of aggression and propagandism\r\nwould cease, or that treaties would be observed. Fox's motion was\r\ndefeated by 187 to 47. Earlier in the session the government brought in\r\na bill against traitorous correspondence, to prevent intercourse with\r\nFrance, and specially such acts as the purchase of French stocks, which\r\ntended to support the enemy. Some of its provisions were unusually\r\nrestrictive, and the penalty of treason was attached to the breach of\r\nany of them. The bill was passed without material alteration. In spite\r\nof the strong feeling against societies believed to advocate\r\nrevolutionary principles, Grey, in accordance with his notice of the\r\nlast session, moved that the petition of the Friends of the People for\r\nparliamentary reform should be considered. His motion, which was\r\nsupported by Fox, was defeated by 282 to 41.\r\n\r\nViolent efforts were made by the government to crush the effects of the\r\nFrench propaganda, by prosecutions for uttering, printing, or publishing\r\nsedition. The attack was indiscriminate; spies were employed, and idle\r\nwords of obscure persons were made grounds of indictment. Both in the\r\nsuperior courts and at quarter sessions severe penalties were inflicted.\r\nOne Frost, a broken-down attorney, and a pestilent rascal enough, though\r\nconvicted merely of saying in a coffee-house that he was \"for equality\r\nand no king,\" was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, to stand in the\r\npillory, and be struck off the roll. A dissenting preacher, found guilty\r\nof using seditious language in the pulpit, was sentenced to fines of\r\nL200 and four years' imprisonment; and Ridgway, a bookseller in\r\nPiccadilly, was awarded the same penalty for selling the _Rights of Man_\r\nand two other pamphlets of a kindred tendency. In Scotland, where the\r\ngovernment business was managed by Dundas, the parliamentary\r\nrepresentation was extremely unsatisfactory; the reformers were violent,\r\nand belonged to revolutionary societies. The sedition cases were mostly\r\nheard before the lord-justice clerk Braxfield, who behaved with\r\nscandalous harshness and severity. One Muir, who had been expelled from\r\nthe society of advocates, though no offence of any magnitude was proved\r\nagainst him at his trial, was condemned to fourteen years'\r\ntransportation. Three others received like sentences, and a dissenting\r\npreacher named Palmer was transported for five years. Adam, an eminent\r\nScottish lawyer, contended in parliament that the sentences on Muir and\r\nPalmer were illegal. His opinion was traversed by Dundas and Pitt, and\r\nhis motion on their behalf was negatived by 171 to 32.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the proceedings of the corresponding and\r\nconstitutional societies were such as no settled government could leave\r\nunpunished. Some few arms and a mass of compromising documents were\r\nseized in Edinburgh, and twelve of the leading members of these\r\nsocieties were arrested in May, 1794. A secret committee of the commons\r\npresented reports on seditious practices, which show that some persons\r\nhad conspired to raise an armed insurrection, and that a so-called\r\nnational convention at Edinburgh was concerned in treasonable\r\nconspiracy. Later in the year one Watt was hanged for engaging in a wild\r\nplot to seize Edinburgh castle and commit other acts of treason. On the\r\npresentation of the first report of the committee the government brought\r\nin a bill to suspend the _habeas corpus_ act. Pitt declared the matter\r\nurgent, and the bill, which was introduced in the commons on Friday the\r\n16th, was passed in a special sitting the next day, though not without a\r\nstruggle, Fox accusing the ministers of a design to terrorise the people\r\nin order to shield themselves from the condemnation which they deserved\r\nfor wickedly involving the country in a disastrous war. The opposition\r\nin the commons did not rise in any division above 39, and the lords\r\npassed the bill by 92 to 7. The ordinary law had hitherto proved\r\nsufficient for the occasion, and a review of the evidence before\r\nparliament does not appear to show adequate cause for arming the\r\nexecutive with an authority so dangerous to liberty. Parliament was\r\nalarmed, and the government shared its alarm and yielded to its desires.\r\nA revulsion of feeling ensued. When the prisoners arrested in May were\r\ntried for treason, the evidence was found to be weak. The first, Hardy,\r\na shoemaker, was brilliantly defended by Erskine, and was acquitted.\r\nHorne Tooke, the only one of the lot in a superior social position,\r\njeered at the court, and called Pitt, the Duke of Richmond, and other\r\ngreat persons to give evidence as to their former connexion with\r\nsocieties for parliamentary reform. He and Thelwall, a lecturer, were\r\nacquitted, and the rest were set at liberty. The general alarm was\r\npacified, and people rejoiced that the high character of the English\r\ncourts of justice should have been vindicated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION._]\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met on January 21, 1794, the opposition was able to\r\ntaunt the government with the feebleness and failure of the military\r\noperations of the past year. An amendment to the address recommending\r\nproposals of peace was moved in both houses. In the lords it was\r\nsupported only by 12 against 97 votes, the Duke of Bedford and Lords\r\nLansdowne, Stanhope, and Lauderdale as usual being conspicuous in\r\nopposition to the ministry. In the commons, Fox urged that the cruel\r\nacts of the jacobin government should not prevent England from\r\nnegotiating with it, to which Pitt replied that no dependence could be\r\nplaced on the existing French government, and that \"any alternative was\r\npreferable to making peace with France upon the system of its present\r\nrulers\". The address was carried by 277 to 59. Votes were passed for\r\n60,000 regular troops and a naval force of 85,000 men. Weak as the\r\nopposition was, it lost no opportunity. Some Hessian troops sent to join\r\na British force arrived off the Isle of Wight before the expedition was\r\nready, and were landed for a short time to prevent them from suffering\r\nfrom sickness. The opposition maintained that this was a violation of\r\nthe bill of rights and the act of settlement. It was easily shown that\r\nthe law had not been violated and that the course pursued was not\r\nirregular, and both lords and commons declined to allow that the matter\r\ncalled for an act of indemnity. Compared with the trifling nature of the\r\noccurrence, the fuss made over it by the opposition can only be\r\nexplained by a desire to impede the government in the performance of its\r\nduty at a time of national danger. An invasion was threatened. The\r\ndefence of England, Grenville said, would best be secured by her\r\n\"water-guard\". It was further provided for by raising volunteers. Dundas\r\nwrote to the lord-lieutenants of counties, recommending subscriptions\r\ntowards the expenses of the movement. Fox and Sheridan declared that\r\nthis recommendation was illegal. Their contention that it was a demand\r\nfor \"benevolences\" was absurd. Yet a request by the government for\r\nmoney, not addressed to the house of commons, seems contrary to the\r\nspirit of the constitution. Nor did the safety of the state, which would\r\noutweigh all such considerations, require the step. But the matter was\r\nof no practical importance and the action of the government was approved\r\nby parliament.\r\n\r\nAs Frederick William was evidently withdrawing from the war, Malmesbury\r\nwas sent to Berlin, late in 1793, to persuade him to continue it. He\r\nwould not do so at his own expense, and it was proposed that the allies\r\nshould pay him to keep 100,000 men in the field. Thugut objected;\r\nAustria could not pay her share and it would be better for Europe and\r\nfor Austria that the king should stay in Prussia than lead so large an\r\narmy to the Rhine.[248] This upset the arrangement. England wanted a\r\nstrong force on the frontier of the Austrian Netherlands, and at last,\r\non April 19, a treaty was signed by which Frederick William agreed to\r\nfurnish 62,400 men to act with the armies of Great Britain and Holland\r\n\"wherever it shall be judged most suitable to the interests of the two\r\nmaritime powers,\" all conquests being at their disposal, on\r\nconsideration of L50,000 a month, and L300,000 at the beginning, and\r\nL100,000 at the end of the campaign, with bread and forage money. Of\r\nthese sums L400,000 was to be paid by Holland and the rest by England.\r\nMack, the Austrian quartermaster-general, came to London and laid a plan\r\nof campaign before the ministers. It was decided that the Austrian and\r\nBritish armies should widen the breach made in the line of French\r\nfortresses, should march on Cambrai and then perhaps on Paris, supported\r\nby an advance of the Prussians from the Moselle, under Mollendorf, who\r\nhad succeeded Brunswick in command. Prompted by Mack, who was then\r\ngenerally believed to be a strategist of supreme skill, the ministers\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction with Coburg, and as difficulties arose with\r\nrespect to the command,[249] the emperor took the ostensible command\r\nhimself and came to Brussels on April 2.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLAND'S ALLIES._]\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened well. The allies invested Landrecies, and an attempt\r\nto turn the British position at Cateau was repulsed by a brilliant\r\ncharge of the 15th light dragoons; a more serious effort to raise the\r\nsiege failed, and Landrecies capitulated on the 30th. The Austrians\r\nunder Clairfait, however, were defeated at Mouscron. York marched to\r\nTournai and the allies attempted by a series of combined movements to\r\ncut off the French in West Flanders from their communications with\r\nLille. Their plan was wrecked by their utter defeat at Tourcoing on May\r\n16, where the British suffered heavily. The French attacked the camp\r\nnear Tournai on the 23rd with the object of forcing the line of the\r\nScheldt, but were foiled, and the British infantry highly distinguished\r\nthemselves by their gallant recapture of the post at Pont-a-chin.\r\nPrussian help was urgently needed for the protection of the Netherlands,\r\nand, though paid for by English gold, was not forthcoming. A formidable\r\ninsurrection broke out in Poland, and Frederick William marched to quell\r\nit, ordering Mollendorf to confine himself to the defence of the empire.\r\nMalmesbury and Cornwallis went to Mainz and urged Mollendorf to proceed\r\nto Flanders; nothing would move him. The emperor was more anxious about\r\nhis interests in Poland than the defence of the Netherlands, and\r\nreturned to Vienna. On June 26, Coburg was defeated by Jourdan at\r\nFleurus and rapidly retired on Waterloo. On July 11, the French entered\r\nBrussels. The Austrians retreated to the Meuse, and York's corps to\r\nMalines where it was joined by 7,000 men under Lord Moira, who had\r\nlanded at Ostend on June 26. Disgusted at the supineness of the\r\nAustrians, who were leaving the British and Dutch to their fate, the\r\nEnglish government insisted that Coburg should be superseded.[250] They\r\nurged the emperor to make an effort to reconquer the Netherlands. Thugut\r\nreplied that Austria had no money, that the Netherlands were more\r\nimportant to England and Holland than to the emperor, who did not get\r\nL200 a year from them, and that the Prussian subsidy ought to be\r\ntransferred to Austria, or a large loan guaranteed.[251] Austria was set\r\non her interests in Poland, and it is scarcely too much to say that she\r\nvirtually betrayed the common cause.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations were brought to an end by the success of the French\r\narms in Germany. The Austrians retreated across the Rhine in October,\r\nand England was not going to pay for the defence of the empire. The\r\nuseless subsidy to Prussia was stopped on the 17th, and Mollendorf\r\nwithdrew his army across the Rhine. Meanwhile York's army had fallen\r\nback on the line of Dutch fortresses; it was driven across the Meuse,\r\nwas forced to retreat from Nimeguen, and encamped behind the Waal.\r\nDissatisfied with his generalship, Pitt, as early as October 11,\r\nrepresented to the king that the division of command between him and the\r\nPrince of Orange was mischievous, and suggested that some experienced\r\ngeneral should be sent out. George, who was deeply attached to his son,\r\nseems to have put the suggestion aside, for on November 23, Pitt wrote\r\nagain insisting on the duke's recall. The king, though \"very much hurt\"\r\nwas forced to yield and the command-in-chief devolved on General\r\nWalmoden.[252] York had shown himself a gallant soldier and had already\r\nproved his capacity as a military administrator, but he was not equal to\r\nthe command of an army in the field.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of the French on the line of the Waal was smartly\r\nrepulsed by Sir David Dundas on January 4, 1795, but they crossed in\r\nlarge force a week later, and the British fell back. The line of the Lek\r\nwas abandoned and the province of Utrecht evacuated. As the French\r\nadvanced, their party among the Dutch gathered strength; the stadholder\r\nfled to England, the Dutch troops separated from the British, Amsterdam\r\nreceived the invaders, and on the 30th the Dutch fleet, which lay frozen\r\nup in the Texel, was captured by French cavalry. Meanwhile the British\r\nsuffered terribly from the severe cold; and their sick and wounded were\r\noften exposed to ill-treatment by the people. The government decided to\r\nwithdraw the army and bring it back by Bremen. It retreated across the\r\nYssel and by the end of February evacuated the United Provinces and\r\nentered Westphalia by way of Enschede. Westphalia was held by\r\nMollendorf's army, and the British troops, worn out by sickness and\r\nprivations, were embarked at Bremen on April 12.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEFECTIONS FROM THE COALITION._]\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1794 the French were everywhere victorious on land. They\r\nwere masters of the Netherlands and were over-running Holland; they held\r\nall the country to the left of the Rhine except Mainz and Luxemburg; a\r\nvictorious French army wintered in Catalonia; the passes of the maritime\r\nAlps were opened, and the Piedmontese were driven back from Mont Cenis\r\nand the Little St. Bernard. The states-general proclaimed the\r\nestablishment of the Batavian republic, and a treaty with France signed\r\non May 16 placed the Dutch in a position of virtual dependence.\r\nFrederick William, anxious to forward his interests in Poland, had\r\nabandoned the war, and was turning towards peace with France. The\r\nspoliation of Poland, which exercised so deadly an effect on the\r\nfortunes of the coalition, was completed in January, 1795, when Russia\r\ndivided the remainder of the country between herself, Austria, and\r\nPrussia by an arrangement confirmed by treaties later in the year. The\r\ncoalition suffered from further defections. The Grand-duke of Tuscany,\r\nwho was compelled by Hood's fleet to break off intercourse with the\r\nrepublic in the summer of 1793, was restored to his former state of\r\nneutrality by a treaty with France. Spain also was deserting the\r\ncoalition. Godoy, the lover of the queen of Charles IV., who controlled\r\nthe policy of the court, opened negotiations with France before the end\r\nof 1794. Among the questions which retarded their progress was the fate\r\nof the Spanish king's young kinsman, the dauphin, or Louis XVII. Death\r\nreleased the poor boy from his misery in June. The French entered\r\nVittoria and were preparing for the siege of Pampeluna. Their successes\r\nhastened matters; the treaty with France was concluded on July 22, 1795,\r\nand the minion Godoy was saluted as \"Prince of the Peace\". Pitt's\r\ncoalition was well-nigh ruined.\r\n\r\nWhile the year 1794 saw the hopes of England frustrated on the\r\ncontinent, she was victorious at sea. Acting on overtures from Paoli,\r\nHood attacked the French in Corsica, and sent Nelson to blockade Bastia,\r\nwhich was surrendered on May 22. Calvi was besieged by a military force\r\nunder General Stuart and by Nelson, who lost his right eye there. Its\r\ncapitulation, on August 10, completed the conquest of the island. In the\r\nWest Indies a squadron under Sir John Jervis and troops commanded by Sir\r\nCharles, afterwards the first Earl Grey, compelled the surrender of\r\nMartinique, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe with Mariegalante. Port-au-Prince\r\nand harbours important to the Jamaica trade were also taken in the\r\nFrench part of San Domingo. But the British force was insufficient for\r\nall that it had to do in the West Indies. French troops landed in\r\nGuadaloupe during the absence of Jervis and Grey, were welcomed by a\r\nlarge part of the creole population, and after a long struggle forced\r\nthe British to evacuate the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE GLORIOUS FIRST OF JUNE._]\r\n\r\nEngland's maritime strength, combined with a bad harvest, war, and\r\ninsurrection, caused a scarcity of food in France which threatened to\r\namount to a famine. A fleet of merchant ships laden with provisions was\r\nanxiously expected from America, and a convoying squadron was sent to\r\nbring it over. The channel fleet, thirty-four ships of the line and\r\nfifteen frigates, under Howe, sailed on May 2 with 148 merchantmen bound\r\nfor different parts. Howe despatched the merchantmen and their convoys\r\nunder Admiral Montagu, with orders that after Montagu had convoyed the\r\nmerchantmen a certain distance, he was to cruise about with six ships of\r\nthe line and look out for the provision ships. Their safe arrival was\r\nvital to France, and Rear-admiral Villaret-Joyeuse sailed with the Brest\r\nfleet to bring them in. As soon as Howe found that the French fleet had\r\nsailed, he determined to strike at the main force of the enemy. He\r\nsighted the French to windward on the 28th, about 400 miles west of\r\nUshant. Their fleet consisted of twenty-six ships of the line, the same\r\nnumber as his own. He at once sent four of his fastest ships to get to\r\nwindward of them, and attack their rear. A partial action took place in\r\nwhich the _Revolutionnaire_ (110) was utterly disabled, and her last\r\nassailant, the _Audacious_ (74), was so crippled that she went home. On\r\nthe 29th Howe planned to obtain the weather-gage and to deliver a\r\nconcentrated attack on the rear of the enemy. He took his flagship, the\r\n_Queen Charlotte_ (100), through the French line, and was followed by\r\ntwo others. Villaret manoeuvred skilfully, but three of his ships were\r\nbadly damaged. The result of Howe's admirable tactics during these two\r\ndays was that four French ships were forced to leave the fleet, and\r\nanother had to be towed by a consort, and that he won the windward\r\nposition and so was enabled to force an action. On the 30th there was a\r\nthick fog, and during the day the French received a reinforcement of\r\nfour ships, giving them the advantage of one over the British. The fog\r\ncleared at noon on the 31st; the British fleet came up with the enemy,\r\nthen to leeward, and \"near sunset\" formed the line of battle.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, June 1, a fresh breeze blowing south by west, the two\r\nfleets lay in parallel lines, the leading British ship being opposite to\r\nthe seventh of the French fleet. The British having formed on the\r\nlarboard line of bearing, Howe brought them down slantwise on the enemy,\r\napparently intending that each ship should pass across the stern of her\r\nopponent, rake her, and engage to leeward. Unlike Rodney in the battle\r\nof the Saints, he deliberately adopted the manoeuvre of breaking the\r\nline, and planned that his ships should fight to leeward instead of to\r\nwindward, and so bar the crippled ships of the enemy from getting away.\r\nAs the _Queen Charlotte_ bore down, he bade the master, Bowen, lay her\r\nas close as he could to Villaret's flagship, the _Montagne_ (120). Bowen\r\nbrought her so close round the Frenchman's stern that the tricolour\r\nensign flapped against her shrouds, and as she passed she raked her\r\ngigantic enemy from stern to stem with her larboard broadside to such\r\neffect that the _Montagne_ lost 300 killed and wounded before she could\r\nmake reply. Six British ships broke through the line and engaged to\r\nleeward; the others remained to windward, the captains perhaps not fully\r\nunderstanding Howe's plan.\r\n\r\nAs the _Brunswick_ (74) tried to force her way through the French line,\r\nher anchors caught in the rigging of the _Vengeur du Peuple_ (74), and\r\nthe two ships drifted side by side in deadly embrace for three hours.\r\nWhen at last they parted the _Brunswick_ had received much damage and\r\nlost 158 men, including her captain, who was mortally wounded. The\r\n_Vengeur_ was a wreck. A broadside from the _Ramillies_ (74) finished\r\nher. She \"hauled her colours down and displayed a Union Jack over her\r\nquarter, and hailed for quarter having struck, her masts going soon\r\nafter, and a-sinking\".[253] The _Alfred_ (74) sent an officer aboard\r\nher, and the boats of three English ships saved about 333 of her crew.\r\nThe \"rest went down with her\". The flatulent account of her end, given\r\nby Barrere in the convention, is largely imaginary. The crew of the\r\n_Vengeur_ did not choose death rather than the surrender of their ship.\r\nSome of those whom the efforts of the British seamen failed to save,\r\nwent down with a cry of _Vive la republique_! They had surrendered after\r\na hard-fought fight, and they died as gallant seamen die. The battle of\r\n\"the glorious first of June\" ended in the complete victory of the\r\nBritish fleet. Six French ships were taken besides the _Vengeur_; five\r\ndismasted and several crippled ships were brought away by Villaret. Howe\r\nmight easily have secured more prizes, but he was an old man, and was\r\ncompletely worn out by the fatigue and anxiety of the last five days.\r\nHis tactics were splendid, though the detaching of part of his fleet\r\nunder Montagu was a strategic mistake. The provision ships got safely\r\ninto Brest, but the French purchased their food at the cost of their\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nIn July the whigs who supported Pitt coalesced with the government. A\r\nthird secretaryship of state was again instituted. Grenville remained\r\nforeign secretary; the Duke of Portland, the nominal head of the\r\nseceding whigs, took the home department, with the colonies, and Dundas\r\nretained the conduct of the war as secretary of state for war. Earl\r\nFitzwilliam became president of the council, and was promised the\r\nvice-royalty of Ireland as soon as a suitable place was found for the\r\npresent lord lieutenant, the Earl of Westmorland. The Marquis of\r\nStafford resigned the privy seal, which was given to Earl Spencer, and\r\nWindham entered the cabinet as secretary-at-war, though his office was\r\nnot then considered as one of cabinet rank. Burke retired from\r\nparliament at the close of the trial of Hastings, and, as he was in\r\nstraitened circumstances, accepted two pensions of L1,200 and L2,500.\r\nThe death of his only son clouded the last years of his noble life. Two\r\nlater changes in office were salutary. Pitt had the unpleasant duty of\r\nurging the king to remove his brother Chatham from the admiralty;[254]\r\nhe resigned on December 20, was succeeded as first lord by Earl Spencer,\r\nan excellent appointment, and succeeded Spencer as privy seal, an office\r\nmore suited to his temperament and talents. The Duke of Richmond was\r\nheld to be inefficient as master of the ordnance; the new ministers\r\ninsisted on his removal, and he was succeeded on February 13, 1795, by\r\nCornwallis. At the same time the king appointed his son York\r\nfield-marshal on the staff; he became commander-in-chief in 1798, but at\r\nno time had a seat in the cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE IRISH CATHOLIC QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nThese accessions and changes strengthened the ministry. For a time,\r\nhowever, the new ministers recruited from the whigs were inclined to act\r\nas a party on questions concerning office. This caused some trouble in\r\nthe cabinet, specially in connexion with Ireland. Although the trade of\r\nIreland was increased by the removal of restrictions, its agriculture\r\nstimulated by bounties on exported corn, and its manufactures and other\r\nresources enlarged by parliamentary grants and wise legislation, its\r\npolitical condition was unsatisfactory. It needed a reform of\r\nparliament, the admission of catholics to political power, the overthrow\r\nof the system by which the castle secured power by the distribution of\r\npensions and offices, and a change in the tithe law. The Earl of\r\nWestmorland had succeeded Buckingham as lord-lieutenant in 1790. Round\r\nhim stood a group of ministers, bishops, and great lords opposed to any\r\nchanges. Revolutionary principles gained ground among the people. The\r\nsociety of United Irishmen, founded by Wolfe Tone, a lawyer, in 1791,\r\naimed at uniting protestants and catholics for the purpose of\r\noverthrowing the English ascendency and effecting a reform of parliament\r\nof a democratic kind. While religious animosity was dying out among the\r\nupper classes, it was rife among the peasantry, and catholic \"defenders\"\r\nand protestant \"peep of day boys\" were at constant war. The catholics\r\nstill suffered from many disabilities. Their hopes of relief were\r\nencouraged by the English relief act of 1791, and by the advocacy of\r\nBurke, who in his _Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe_ (1792), argued\r\nagainst the monopoly of power by the protestants, and allowed his son to\r\nact as the professional adviser of the catholic committee. The English\r\nministers favoured the catholics, and dreaded an alliance between them\r\nand the democratic party among the protestants, which would bring them\r\nover to join in the demand for parliamentary reform.\r\n\r\nDundas urged the Irish government to assent to the enfranchisement of\r\nthe catholics on grounds both of justice and expediency. Westmorland and\r\nhis advisers objected. Pitt recommended them to give way, and wrote that\r\nin any case they must not deprive the catholics of hope. In a letter to\r\nWestmorland he pointed out that no danger could possibly arise from\r\nenfranchisement if Ireland were united to England, a plan which, he\r\nsaid, had long been in his mind.[255] The Irish government yielded, and\r\na bill granting the catholics the suffrage and other relief became law\r\nin April, 1793. They were still shut out from parliament and from high\r\noffices of state. The measure was ill-conceived, for while it conferred\r\npolitical power upon the poor and ignorant catholics, it left the\r\ncatholic gentry, a loyal and conservative body, debarred from exercising\r\nthe influence to which their position entitled them. On the outbreak of\r\nthe war Grattan supported the government; and parliament voted liberal\r\nsupplies for the army and navy, and passed a bill establishing an Irish\r\nmilitia of the same kind as that of England. The country was disturbed\r\nby troubles over the compulsory enlistment for the militia and by the\r\nlawlessness of the defenders. A period of comparative quiet, however,\r\nfollowed the relief act, and the rejection of a moderate reform bill in\r\n1794 created no disturbance. Nevertheless secret disloyalty increased,\r\nand Tone and some of his allies held seditious correspondence with\r\nFrance.[256] The United Irishmen grew in numbers, for while the leaders,\r\nTone, Emmet, and Rowan were protestants, they were joined by many\r\ncatholics. On the other hand, Grattan and his party, supported by most\r\nof the protestant and many of the catholic gentry, though anxious for\r\nreforms and specially for the complete repeal of the catholic\r\ndisabilities, were strongly opposed to the democratic movement and were\r\nloyal to the constitution of 1782.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FITZWILLIAM AS VICEROY._]\r\n\r\nTheir hopes were raised by the prospect of the speedy appointment of\r\nFitzwilliam as lord-lieutenant, which seemed to promise a change of\r\nsystem favourable to the hopes of the Irish whigs. On taking office as\r\npresident of the council in July, Fitzwilliam, in common with Portland,\r\nto whose department Ireland belonged, thought that he was to succeed\r\nWestmorland without delay; he appointed his chief secretary and openly\r\nentered into communications with Grattan and Ponsonby which implied\r\nextensive changes both of men and measures.[257] The Irish were\r\ndelighted. Pitt, however, did not mean to give Ireland over to Portland\r\nand Fitzwilliam. Unfortunately he let matters slide; though he did not\r\nrecall Westmorland, he abstained from checking Fitzwilliam's somewhat\r\npremature proceedings. In October, Portland pressed for Fitzwilliam's\r\nimmediate appointment. Pitt then said that he would not consent to a\r\nchange of system, and specially not to the dismissal of the chancellor,\r\nFitzgibbon, and would not recall Westmorland until he had a suitable\r\nplace to offer him. A serious quarrel ensued between him and the new\r\nministers of Portland's party. At last a compromise was effected. A\r\ncourt office was found for Westmorland. Fitzwilliam in an interview with\r\nPitt and other ministers disavowed all idea of a general change of\r\nsystem, agreed to some arrangements with regard to appointments, and was\r\ninstructed to prevent, if possible, the agitation of the catholic\r\nquestion during the coming session, though if he could not evade it he\r\nwas to be at liberty to give the measure his full support.[258] Pitt was\r\nfavourable to catholic emancipation, but wished to have no changes\r\nduring the war. Fitzwilliam received his appointment and was succeeded\r\nas president of the council by the Earl of Mansfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FITZWILLIAM RECALLED._]\r\n\r\nHe landed in Ireland on January 4, 1795. His appointment had inspired\r\nthe catholic committee with fresh vigour, and he found that the\r\ncatholics were united on the question of a complete removal of\r\ndisabilities and that the mass of the protestant gentry favoured their\r\ndemand. Defenderism was active and the country was in a disturbed state.\r\nHe informed the cabinet that the catholic question was urgent.\r\nParliament met and in a loyal humour voted large supplies for the war.\r\nGrattan undertook the catholic business, and Fitzwilliam promised his\r\nsupport, and pressed for the approval of the cabinet on the ground that\r\na complete repeal of all disqualifying laws was necessary in order to\r\nsecure the pacification and loyalty of the country. No answer was sent\r\nto his appeals. Meanwhile Fitzwilliam dismissed some administrative\r\nofficers and among them Beresford, a powerful member of the party which\r\nhad so long been preponderant at the castle. Beresford carried his\r\ncomplaint to London, and Pitt remonstrated with Fitzwilliam on his\r\ndismissal. Portland, too, at last wrote, warning him not to commit\r\nhimself on the catholic question. It was too late. Portland wrote again\r\nand declared himself hostile to emancipation. Fitzwilliam expostulated\r\nin vain, and finally, on February 23, the cabinet agreed to recall him.\r\nHe left Ireland on March 25. It was a day of general gloom; the Dublin\r\ntradesmen put up their shutters, no business was transacted, and many\r\npersons wore mourning. The hopes of Ireland were bitterly disappointed\r\nand the door seemed shut against reforms by constitutional means. Lord\r\nCamden was appointed lord-lieutenant, the catholic bill was rejected,\r\nFitzgibbon was made Earl of Clare, and the party in favour of the\r\nprotestant ascendency was re-established in power. Whether the presence\r\nof catholics in the parliament would have led to such a thorough removal\r\nof the causes of Irish discontent as would have pacified the country and\r\nsaved it from the rebellion of 1798 seems extremely doubtful, but it is\r\ncertain that the recall of Fitzwilliam was fatal to any chance of so\r\nhappy a settlement.\r\n\r\nAlthough he acted hastily and unadvisedly as regards the dismissals, he\r\nwas right in saying that it was impossible for him to stave off the\r\ncatholic claims, and that no measures would secure the loyalty of the\r\ncatholics or the peace of Ireland unless they were satisfied. As Pitt\r\ndesired to defer emancipation to an uncertain date, the end of the war,\r\nhe should not have excited the expectation of the Irish by an\r\nappointment which they naturally interpreted as a sign of immediate\r\nacquiescence. Fitzwilliam, before his actual appointment, was allowed to\r\ncommit himself to a line of conduct to which Pitt afterwards objected;\r\nhis instructions were somewhat vague, and he did not receive timely\r\nnotice that the cabinet would not assent to the policy he was\r\nadopting.[259] Deeply immersed in the conduct of the war, Pitt seems to\r\nhave neglected the affairs of Ireland at this time, and to have failed\r\nto appreciate the gravity of the crisis. Fitzwilliam's recall was due\r\npartly to Pitt's unwillingness to offend Beresford's powerful friends in\r\nboth countries and the whole party which had given him valuable\r\nsupport,[260] partly to his determination to avoid any change of system\r\nduring the war, and partly to the dislike of some other members of the\r\ncabinet, plainly expressed by Portland, to the proposed overthrow of the\r\nprotestant ascendency. Yet another influence was brought to bear on the\r\ndecision of the cabinet. On February 6 the king sent Pitt a statement of\r\nhis strong objection to emancipation, both as a matter of policy and on\r\nreligious grounds, ending with the remark that it would be better to\r\nchange the new Irish administration than to submit to it.[261] His\r\nfeelings were strengthened by hearing, perhaps from Westmorland, that\r\nFitzgibbon was of opinion that he could not give the royal assent to\r\ncatholic emancipation without a breach of his coronation oath and of the\r\nact of succession,[262] a mistaken idea which ruled his later conduct\r\nwith lamentable results. He consulted some great lawyers on the point;\r\nLord Kenyon and Scott, the attorney-general, assured him that he could\r\nassent to a change in the test act without breach of his oath, but the\r\nchancellor, Loughborough, gave him an undecided answer which tended to\r\nstrengthen his opinion. His feelings on the question doubtless confirmed\r\nthe ministers in their decision, but must not be supposed to have\r\ndictated it.[263]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241] This question is admirably dealt with by Lord Rosebery in his\r\n_Pitt_, pp. 148-60.\r\n\r\n[242] Newmarch, _On the Loans Raised by Mr. Pitt_, pp. 25-27; W.

The fall of\r\nRobespierre and the end of the Terror on July 28 (10th Thermidor) were\r\nfollowed by a reaction; the revolutionary committees lost their\r\ndictatorial power, the convention regained its supremacy, and the\r\njacobin club was closed. This reaction, combined with the success of the\r\nFrench arms in the Netherlands and Holland, the decay of the coalition,\r\nthe burdens entailed by the war, and the conviction that the republican\r\ngovernment would gain in stability by foreign opposition, led some of\r\nPitt's followers to desire an attempt at negotiation. The king's speech\r\nurged a vigorous prosecution of the war, and was ably seconded in the\r\ncommons by a young member, George Canning, one of Pitt's devoted\r\nadherents. Pitt's friend, Wilberforce, moved an amendment for opening\r\nnegotiations, and the minority against the government was 73. Soon\r\nafterwards in two divisions, arising out of a resolution moved by Grey\r\nin January, 1795, the minority rose to 86 and 90. As in these divisions\r\nthe minority included some of Pitt's regular supporters, they are highly\r\nsignificant. As regards domestic affairs the opposition remained in its\r\nnormal condition. A motion for the repeal of the _habeas corpus_\r\nsuspension act, which led to a debate on the late trials for treason,\r\nwas defeated by 239 to 41, and attacks on the government with reference\r\nto the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam were easily foiled by the assertion of\r\nthe right of the crown to dismiss its confidential servants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE PRINCE OF WALES._]\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the Prince of Wales again demanded the attention of\r\nparliament. He had not mended his ways since 1787; his creditors pressed\r\nhim and put executions in his house. He could no longer reckon on the\r\nsupport of the opposition in any application to parliament, for he had\r\nvoted against them on the seditious publications bill in 1792. In order\r\nto escape from his difficulties he promised the king to marry Caroline,\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Brunswick. She was brought over to England by\r\nLord Malmesbury, and though at his first interview with her the prince\r\ndid not conceal his disgust, the marriage took place on April 8. Pitt\r\nbrought a royal message to the commons requesting in humble terms that\r\nthey would enable the prince to pay his debts and would make a provision\r\nfor him and the princess. He stated the prince's debts at about\r\nL630,000, and proposed that the princess should have a jointure of\r\nL50,000 a year, that the prince's income should be increased by L65,000,\r\nmaking it L125,000 a year, exclusive of the duchy of Cornwall, and that\r\nL25,000 a year should be deducted for the interest on his debts, and the\r\nrevenues of the duchy appropriated for the gradual payment of them. Grey\r\nmoved that the increase should only be L40,000. Fox reminded the house\r\nthat in 1787 the prince promised that he would not again apply to\r\nparliament for payment of his debts, and suggested that the augmentation\r\nof L65,000 and the income of the duchy should be used for the purpose.\r\nPitt's proposals were carried. The princess, a coarse-minded and giddy\r\nyoung woman, was shamefully treated by her husband, and after the birth\r\nof their daughter, the Princess Charlotte, in January, 1796, they\r\nfinally separated.\r\n\r\nFor the prosecution of the war parliament voted 100,000 seamen,\r\nincluding marines, and L14,500,000 for army expenses; the total supplies\r\nwere about L27,500,000. Ten new taxes were imposed, one of them on\r\nhair-powder at twenty-one shillings a head, which was calculated at\r\nL210,000; and a loan of L18,000,000 was effected. With this year began a\r\nperiod of difficulty in raising money and the loan was only obtained at\r\nthe total rate of L4 16s. 2d. per cent. In February Pitt hoped to\r\nprevent Prussia from making peace with France, and to induce the king to\r\nrenew the war by the grant of another subsidy. Grenville, who was\r\nconvinced that no reliance could be placed on Prussia, objected and\r\nthreatened to resign if Pitt persisted in his plan. He desired a close\r\nalliance with Austria, and believed that the grant of a subsidy to\r\nPrussia would alienate the courts of Vienna and St. Petersburg. Pitt\r\nwould not give way, and Grenville promised to keep his intended\r\nresignation a secret until the end of the session. He privately\r\nannounced his resignation to the king, who, though he had at first been\r\nopposed to a Prussian subsidy, was then on Pitt's side, for he was\r\ndiscouraged by the ill-success of Austria. Pitt's project came to\r\nnaught; for on April 5 Frederick William made a treaty with France at\r\nBasle, by which he surrendered the Prussian territories on the left bank\r\nof the Rhine. Secret articles provided that if France kept those\r\nterritories he should be indemnified elsewhere. Grenville continued in\r\noffice; Pitt had cause to rejoice that he was saved from a serious\r\nmistake, and the threatened disruption of the cabinet remained a\r\nsecret.[264]\r\n\r\nGeorge himself had advised Grenville in December, 1794, to persuade\r\nAustria to renew the war by granting her a subsidy or a loan. His advice\r\nwas in accordance with Grenville's own wishes. An arrangement with\r\nCatherine of Russia determined the Austrian emperor to carry on the war,\r\nwith the intention of indemnifying himself at the expense of Bavaria and\r\nVenice, if he was unable to recover the Netherlands and conquer Lorraine\r\nand Alsace, and England had to find him money. By a convention signed on\r\nMay 4 the government guaranteed a loan of L4,600,000 to be raised in\r\nLondon, to enable him to employ an army of 200,000 men. Defensive\r\ntreaties were also concluded with Russia and Austria, and a triple\r\nalliance was formed in virtue of which Russia sent subsidies to Austria;\r\nfor Catherine would take no part in the war by land. The imperial loan,\r\nwhich in 1798 became a charge on the consolidated fund, was raised at\r\nthe rate of 7-1/2 per cent. It was unsuccessfully opposed by Fox, who\r\nargued against the general policy of making grants to foreign powers,\r\nwhether by way of loans or subsidies, and pointed out that the only real\r\ndifference between a loan and a subsidy was that, in the case of a loan\r\nEngland would not be able to get rid of the payment, whereas a monthly\r\nsubsidy could be stopped if the contract was broken.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the war was not marked by any great event. France was much\r\ndistressed by domestic troubles. Public credit failed; and Pitt,\r\nspeaking on Grey's motion for peace, argued that France was near the end\r\nof her resources. Food was scarce and half Paris was only kept alive by\r\ndistributions of bread and meat at low prices. The jacobins of Paris\r\nwere crushed by the thermidoriens, and in the south-east a sanguinary\r\nmovement of the enemies of the republic, the \"white terror,\" pursued its\r\ncourse unchecked. In August a new constitution was adopted of a far less\r\ndemocratic character than that of 1793; the executive was vested in a\r\ndirectory of five and the legislative in two assemblies. An insurrection\r\nin Paris on October 5 was quelled mainly by the fire of a few cannon\r\nunder the command of Bonaparte, and the revolution assumed an organised\r\nand settled form. Three years of war had brought Austria also to a state\r\nof exhaustion. Active operations, therefore, did not begin until late.\r\nLuxemburg surrendered after a blockade; and in the autumn Jourdan and\r\nPichegru led two armies across the Rhine at different points. Jourdan\r\ndrove the Austrians back and invested Mainz; Pichegru occupied Mannheim.\r\nClairfait, however, forced Jourdan to abandon the siege of Mainz and cut\r\nthe two French generals off from one another. Mannheim was retaken and\r\nboth the French armies were pushed back across the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A LOST OPPORTUNITY._]\r\n\r\nIn the war on the Italian frontier the British fleet in the\r\nMediterranean bore some part. In Hood's absence it was commanded by\r\nAdmiral Hotham, a distinguished officer, though lacking in dash and\r\nresolution. The French threatened Corsica with their Toulon fleet.\r\nHotham engaged them on March 13 and 14, and cut off their two rearmost\r\nships, but in Nelson's opinion lost an opportunity of destroying the\r\nwhole fleet. The attempt on Corsica, however, was abandoned. Both fleets\r\nwere reinforced; for the watch on Brest was slackly kept and six ships\r\nwere allowed to leave the port and sail to Toulon. Another engagement in\r\nHyeres bay on July 13 only resulted in the destruction of one French\r\nship, and was another lost opportunity. The command of the sea, which\r\nwould have carried with it the control of the Italian states, was not\r\nsecured. Meanwhile an Austrian army, acting with the Sardinians and\r\nrelying on the co-operation of the British fleet, forced the French to\r\nevacuate Vado. The two armies faced one another, the Austrians waiting\r\nuntil the French should be compelled to retire by want of provisions;\r\nfor as they were cut off from Genoa they depended on supplies by sea.\r\nHotham detached Nelson with a small squadron to intercept their\r\nsupplies and co-operate with the Austrians. He performed his duty with\r\ncharacteristic energy, but the ships which Hotham allowed him were too\r\nfew for the work he had to do. The French army was strongly reinforced\r\nand was supplied by coasting vessels. The allies were totally defeated\r\nin the battle of Loano on November 23. The Austrians retreated beyond\r\nthe Apennines, and the French had no further difficulty in obtaining\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _QUIBERON._]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1794 Pitt was persuaded by the Count de Puisaye, a\r\nleader of the Breton Chouans, to send an expedition to support them. The\r\nexpeditionary force was to consist of French emigrants headed by the\r\nCount of Artois, the youngest brother of Louis XVI. Emigrants were\r\nenlisted in England and from the force lately serving on the Rhine, and\r\nthe government supplied arms and money. It was hoped that an unexpected\r\ndescent on the coast would enable the royalists in the west to gain an\r\nimmediate success, which was to be followed up by an invasion of a\r\nBritish force under Lord Moira. The plan became known, and in June it\r\nwas necessary to act at once. The first body of emigrants, about 3,500\r\nmen, under Puisaye and Hervilly, with large supplies of all kinds and\r\nspecially of arms for future recruits, sailed on the 16th in a squadron\r\ncommanded by Sir John Warren. The Brest fleet was on the watch for them,\r\nand Warren sent for help to Lord Bridport, then in command of the\r\nchannel fleet. Bridport caught the French, who were inferior in\r\nstrength, off the Ile de Groix and captured three of their line of\r\nbattle, but allowed the rest to escape into L'Orient. On the 27th the\r\nemigrants were landed on the peninsula of Quiberon and, with some help\r\nfrom the squadron, took the fortress of Penthievre which commanded it. A\r\nlarge number of Chouans joined them and arms were distributed among the\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\nPuisaye and Hervilly quarrelled. Time was wasted, and Hoche, who was in\r\ncommand in Brittany, drove in the Chouans from their advanced posts and\r\nshut the whole force up in the peninsula. They made an attempt to break\r\nout on July 16; Hervilly was wounded and his troops retreated under\r\ncover of the fire from British gunboats. A second party landed under\r\nSombreuil. More quarrelling ensued and then treachery, for Hervilly had\r\nenlisted some who were republicans at heart. These men betrayed their\r\ncompanions, and with their help Hoche stormed the fort of Penthievre,\r\nand fell on the royalists in the peninsula. Many were slaughtered;\r\nothers fled. It blew hard, and for a time the British ships could do\r\nlittle for the fugitives. At last they were able to take off Puisaye and\r\nsome 3,500 others. Sombreuil and about a thousand under him were cut\r\noff, and laid down their arms. Sombreuil was tried and executed at\r\nVannes, and over 700 were shot in batches on successive days in a field\r\nnear Auray. The fugitives were landed on the islands of Houat and Haedik\r\nwhich were covered by the squadron. Then the Count of Artois with a\r\nthird division of the expedition and a body of British troops appeared,\r\ntook possession of the Ile d'Yeu, and seemed about to cross over to the\r\nmainland to co-operate with the Vendeans. However nothing further was\r\ndone of any importance, and in October the troops were embarked for\r\nEngland. The Vendeans, who had hoped in vain to receive help, and to be\r\nheaded by Artois, were again crushed, and the only result of this\r\nill-planned and deplorable expedition was the ruin of the royalist cause\r\nin the west.\r\n\r\nNor were events cheering in the West Indies during 1795. The reconquest\r\nof Guadaloupe, due to the insufficiency of the British force sent out in\r\n1794, led to disastrous consequences. The French firmly established\r\nthemselves in the island and made it a centre for operations, St. Lucia\r\nwas taken, and insurrections of French inhabitants, negroes, and native\r\nraces were fomented and supported in St. Vincent's, Grenada, and\r\nDominica. An insurrection of the Maroons caused much trouble in Jamaica,\r\nand the government of the island imported bloodhounds from Cuba to track\r\nthe fugitive insurgents. Great indignation was expressed in parliament\r\nat this measure, and it was asserted that the dogs tore the natives in\r\npieces. Dundas explained that the home government was not responsible\r\nfor the importation of the dogs, and promised that if they were used for\r\nsuch a horrid purpose the practice should be stopped. In 1796 a large\r\nforce was sent to the West Indies under Sir Ralph Abercromby and Admiral\r\nChristian. St. Lucia was retaken and the British power re-established in\r\nthe Antilles. The French, however, retained Guadaloupe, and privateers\r\nboth from that island and Cuba did much damage to the West India trade.\r\nEngland gained largely by the alliance between Holland and France, for\r\nit threw the Dutch colonies open to attack. Their rich settlements in\r\nCeylon, Malacca, and on the Malabar coast; the Cape (September, 1795);\r\nDemarara, Essequibo, and the Moluccas (1796) were taken without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nEngland's naval power was already forwarding the increase of her trade,\r\nand the total loss of commerce with France, Holland, and the Belgian\r\nNetherlands was more than counterbalanced by its increase with Germany,\r\nRussia, and the United States. With the United States some serious\r\ndifficulties with respect to neutral rights were happily settled in 1794\r\nby a treaty which was negotiated on their part by Jay, and finally\r\nratified in 1796. Yet the year 1795 was one of great distress among the\r\npoor. Two bad harvests in succession raised the average price of wheat,\r\nwhich in 1792 had been 43s., to 75s. 2d. Bread riots broke out in\r\nSussex, in Birmingham, Nottingham, Coventry, and other places. Bills\r\nwere passed with the object of husbanding the supply of wheat; liberal\r\nbounties were granted on importation, and the members of parliament\r\nentered into an agreement to curtail the use of wheaten flour in their\r\nown households. A bill for the regulation of wages, introduced by\r\nWhitbread, the brewer, and advocated by Fox, was opposed by Pitt and was\r\nrejected. Starving men are quick to believe assertions that their\r\nsufferings are caused by ill-government, and the corresponding society,\r\nencouraged by the failure of the prosecutions in 1794, was active in\r\nspreading political discontent. At a large meeting held in St. George's\r\nFields on July 29, an address to the king was voted and resolutions were\r\npassed demanding annual parliaments, universal suffrage, and above all\r\npeace, as remedies for the high price of food. Parliament was summoned\r\nfor October 29. On the 26th, a meeting in Copenhagen Fields,\r\nMary-le-bone, at which 150,000 persons are said to have been present,\r\nadopted a strongly worded \"remonstrance\" to the king, praying for\r\nparliamentary reform, the dismissal of the ministers, and a speedy\r\npeace. When the king went to open parliament a large crowd greeted him\r\nwith hisses and cries of \"Bread! Peace! No Pitt!\" His carriage was\r\npelted, and a missile, probably from an air-gun, broke the glass. On his\r\nreturn the same cries were raised; there was more pelting, and the king\r\nwas only rescued from the crowd by the arrival of some horse-guards.\r\nGeorge, than whom no braver man lived in his dominions, remained\r\nperfectly calm throughout these scenes, read the royal speech without a\r\nsign of excitement, and the next night went with the queen and the\r\nprincesses to Covent Garden theatre, where he was received with\r\nenthusiasm. The soldiers also acted admirably and abstained from hurting\r\nany one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSIVE ACTS._]\r\n\r\nThe insult to the king and the proceedings of the corresponding society\r\nwere met by repressive measures. Proclamations relating to the outrage\r\nand to seditious assemblies were followed by two bills, one introduced\r\nin the lords by Grenville, the other in the commons by Pitt. The first,\r\nthe treasonable practices bill, extended the crime of treason to spoken\r\nand written words not followed by any overt act, and created a new crime\r\nby subjecting to heavy penalties any one convicted of inciting others to\r\nhatred of the sovereign or the established government. The second, the\r\nseditious meetings bill, forbade all political meetings of which notice\r\nhad not previously been given by resident householders, and empowered\r\nany two justices to dissolve a legally constituted meeting at their\r\ndiscretion by using the riot act. Both these measures were grievous\r\nencroachments on liberty. Apart from its extension of the law of\r\ntreason, the first might be used to prevent all discussion of political\r\nreforms; the second checked the public expression of opinion on public\r\naffairs. The ministry, however, was acting in accordance with the will\r\nof parliament and of the vast majority of the respectable part of the\r\nnation, who were alarmed and indignant at the success of seditious\r\nagitators in exciting political discontent among the uneducated classes.\r\nEngland was engaged in a struggle for existence, and could not afford to\r\ntolerate sedition. Looking back on issues then incalculable, we may\r\nthink that repression was carried farther than was necessary; but\r\nanything was better than the least sign of weakness in dealing with\r\nseditious practices. Excited meetings, over one of which Fox presided,\r\nwere held to condemn the bills. Numerous petitions, mostly got up by the\r\ncorresponding society, were presented against them; and many were\r\npresented in their favour. They were violently opposed by the minority\r\nin parliament, and Fox declared that if they became law, obedience would\r\nno longer be a question of duty but of prudence, a direct incitement to\r\nrebellion only to be excused as uttered in the heat of debate, an excuse\r\nwhich is also needed for some foolish and intemperate language on the\r\nother side. The sedition bill, which was limited to three years, was\r\namended by giving up the clause empowering magistrates to dissolve\r\nmeetings at their discretion as dangerous to the public peace. The two\r\nbills were passed in both houses by overwhelming majorities. The treason\r\nact was only to last during the king's life, and both acts proved quite\r\nharmless, for neither was ever called into operation.\r\n\r\nPitt's budget for 1796 included another loan of L18,000,000 and several\r\nnew taxes, one of them on salt. He proposed duties on legacies and on\r\ncollateral successions to real estate. The first was easily carried, but\r\nFox, in spite of his democratic professions, seized on the proposal to\r\nmake landed estates equally liable with other property to taxation, as\r\nan opportunity for thwarting the government by exciting the selfishness\r\nof the landed gentry, and Pitt found that so many of his supporters were\r\nhostile to the tax that he withdrew his proposal. Nor was the inequality\r\nredressed until 1853, when Gladstone, following Pitt's lead, made all\r\nsuccessions alike liable to duty. As at the end of the session in May\r\nparliament was near the term of its natural life, a new parliament was\r\nelected. The returns showed that the government had lost no ground in\r\nthe confidence of the country: as a rule, the large constituencies\r\nelected supporters of Pitt; indeed, twenty-three of Fox's small\r\nfollowing were returned for nomination boroughs.\r\n\r\nThe policy of England in 1796 was closely connected with the course of\r\nthe war between her Austrian ally and the French. In March Bonaparte\r\ntook the command of the army of Italy. He defeated the Austrians at\r\nMontenotte, and compelled the Sardinian king to abandon the coalition.\r\nHe crossed the Po, forced the passage of the Adda at Lodi, and occupied\r\nMilan on May 14. The Austrians fell back behind the Mincio, and\r\ngarrisoned the strong fortress of Mantua. Bonaparte levied contributions\r\non the Dukes of Parma and Modena, forced the papal states to submission,\r\noccupied Leghorn, which was thus closed against our ships, and reduced\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany to obedience. In June Ferdinand of Naples and\r\nthe pope made armistices with France. The Austrian power in Italy\r\ndepended on the possession of Mantua. Wurmser forced Bonaparte to raise\r\nthe siege, and the Austrians though defeated at Lonato and Castiglione,\r\nregarrisoned the place. A second attempt by Wurmser to relieve it was\r\ndefeated in August, and he was shut into Mantua. If Hotham had destroyed\r\nthe French fleet in the Mediterranean, Bonaparte would not have carried\r\neverything before him in the Italian states south of the Po. As it was,\r\nhis success had an unfortunate effect on England's naval war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FLEET LEAVES THE MEDITERRANEAN._]\r\n\r\nAfter 1795 the French made no more attempts to cope with an English\r\nfleet. They employed their navy only in military expeditions and in the\r\ndestruction of British commerce.[265] The watch upon their ports was\r\nslackly kept and ships constantly left them. Much damage was done to\r\nEngland's trade, specially by privateers; her navy was largely employed\r\nin convoy duty, and actions between small squadrons and single ships\r\nwere frequent. In this year a French squadron cruelly ravaged the coast\r\nof Newfoundland, another captured part of a West India convoy, and a\r\nthird made some prizes in the Levant. Warfare of this kind, though\r\ntroublesome to England, could not affect her maritime supremacy. That\r\nwas impaired by the results of Bonaparte's campaign in Italy. In\r\nDecember, 1795, the command in the Mediterranean was taken by Sir John\r\nJervis, a fine seaman and a strict disciplinarian, who soon brought the\r\nfleet to a high state of efficiency. He kept a strict watch on Toulon,\r\nand employed Nelson in intercepting the French communications by sea. By\r\nthe end of June the ports of Tuscany, Naples, and the papal dominions\r\nwere shut against his ships; Corsica was restless, and the fleet was in\r\ndanger of being left without a base. In July Nelson, who was then\r\nblockading Leghorn, occupied Elba in order to gain a harbour and\r\nestablish a place of stores at Porto Ferrajo. A new danger, however,\r\nthreatened the fleet, for Spain, influenced by Bonaparte's successes,\r\nmade an offensive and defensive alliance with France by a treaty signed\r\non August 19; and as the Spaniards had over fifty ships of the line, the\r\nposition of the British fleet became critical. And there was work for it\r\nelsewhere, for Portugal was in need of help. The Austrian cause in Italy\r\nseemed almost hopeless, and Jervis received orders to evacuate the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThen better news came to England; the Austrians had achieved a signal\r\nsuccess in Germany. Two French armies under Jourdan and Moreau crossed\r\nthe Rhine in the summer and acted independently of each other. After a\r\ncampaign of about two months Jourdan was defeated by the Archduke\r\nCharles at Amberg, and again near Wurzburg on September 3, and was\r\nforced to recross the Rhine. Moreau advanced as far as Munich, for\r\nBonaparte intended, after the fall of Mantua, which he believed would\r\nnot be delayed, to effect a junction with him in Bavaria. Jourdan's\r\noverthrow left Moreau in a critical position, and he only saved his army\r\nby a masterly retreat through the Black Forest. Bonaparte's hope that he\r\nwould soon bring the war to an end by marching into Bavaria, and on\r\nVienna, was disappointed. His army was kept on the Mincio, for Mantua\r\nremained untaken, and another army under Alvinzi was preparing to march\r\nto its relief. Italy was not conquered yet, and on October 19 the\r\ncabinet decided that the fleet should remain in the Mediterranean.[266]\r\nIt was then too late. Corsica and Elba were abandoned; Ferdinand of\r\nNaples made peace with France, and Jervis sailed for Lisbon. After three\r\nyears in the Mediterranean the fleet retired from its waters; its\r\ndeparture left that sea closed to British commerce, assured Bonaparte's\r\ncommunications, and strengthened his hold over Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE._]\r\n\r\nPitt, driven into war against his will, was sincerely anxious for peace.\r\nHe had entered on the war for political reasons, and would not be\r\ndeterred from negotiation by dislike of the French republican\r\ngovernment. His views were not shared by all his colleagues; Windham and\r\nPitt's whig supporters generally were averse from peace because they\r\ndesired the overthrow of the revolutionary system. The king fully\r\nsympathised with them, and their sentiments were stimulated and\r\nexpressed by Burke, whose first _Letter on a Regicide Peace_ appeared in\r\nthe autumn. Pitt believed that the new French government would be\r\nwilling to treat, and that it would remain in power, so that a stable\r\npeace might be hoped for. The king's speech at the opening of parliament\r\nin October, 1795, stated that the government would be willing to treat,\r\nand this was emphatically declared in a royal message to parliament on\r\nDecember 8. Sorely against the king's will, an attempt at negotiation\r\nwas made in the early spring through Wickham, the British ambassador at\r\nBerne. His overtures were scornfully rejected, the directors replying\r\nthat no proposition for the surrender of any of the countries declared\r\nby France to be \"re-united\" to herself would be entertained. This was\r\nfinal; for England was bound by treaty to maintain the integrity of the\r\nAustrian dominions, and could treat only on the basis of the surrender\r\nof the Austrian Netherlands by France.\r\n\r\nIn July the cabinet determined to make another attempt. A strong party\r\nin France desired peace, and the friends and agents of the British\r\ngovernment abroad represented that the directors would be unable to\r\nresist its demands. The expenses of the war were enormous, for Austria\r\nclamoured for financial support; and it seemed possible that the\r\nemperor, pressed by the double French invasion of Germany and by\r\nBonaparte's victories in Italy, might make a separate peace.[267]\r\nEngland's naval successes had given her much that Pitt could offer. And\r\nhe would offer much, for he was in earnest in his attempt. If it did not\r\nsucceed he would at least show the nation that he desired peace, and the\r\nrejection of his offers would wound its pride, rouse its spirit, and\r\nencourage it to bear the burden of the war. George believed that the\r\nattempt would fail, and consented to it because he reckoned that its\r\nfailure would have this effect on the nation. In September the cabinet\r\nrequested the Danish ambassador in Paris to ask for a passport for an\r\nEnglish minister. The directors rejected his mediation, but the strength\r\nof the peace party prevented them from declining all negotiation, and\r\nthey offered to receive a minister if the British government made an\r\nofficial request. Great Britain was, in fact, to sue for peace. The\r\ngovernment acquiesced, and Malmesbury was sent over to Paris. England\r\noffered all that she had conquered from France for a peace which should\r\ninclude her allies, if France would surrender the Austrian Netherlands\r\neither to the emperor or in exchange for some equivalent which he would\r\naccept, and restore the Milanese. The surrender of the Netherlands was\r\nrefused, and on December 19 Malmesbury was ordered to leave Paris in\r\ntwenty-four hours. This abrupt termination was connected with the death\r\nof Catherine of Russia on November 17, soon after she had agreed to\r\nsupport Austria with an army of 60,000 men to be paid by England. Her\r\nhalf-crazy son and successor, Paul, declared himself neutral. On the\r\npart of the directory, however, the negotiations were illusory,\r\nundertaken merely to appease domestic discontent. The French declared\r\nthat England's offers were insincere. Fox and his party adopted the same\r\nline, and their attacks on the government left them with thirty-seven\r\nsupporters in the commons and eight in the lords.\r\n\r\nThis ineffectual negotiation roughly coincides with the beginning of an\r\nawful period of stress and depression. The directory designed to isolate\r\nEngland, reduce her to bankruptcy by destroying her commerce, and\r\ncomplete her ruin by invasion. Already Austria, her one efficient ally,\r\nwas nearly exhausted; her commerce was shut out from the Mediterranean,\r\nand, though vigorously pushed in other quarters, was constantly\r\nharassed, and a plan of invasion was ripe for prosecution. Pitt met the\r\nprospect of invasion by proposals for increasing the army and navy by\r\nparochial levies, and for the formation of militia reserves and\r\nirregular cavalry. Fox asserted that the French did not contemplate an\r\ninvasion, and that the immediate duty of parliament was to guard the\r\nfreedom of the people against its domestic enemies, the ministers. This\r\ndisgraceful speech roused the indignation of the peace-loving\r\nWilberforce, who declared that Fox and his friends seemed to wish that\r\njust so much evil should befall their country as would bring them into\r\noffice. Though the government easily carried its proposals for defence,\r\nit was embarrassed by financial difficulties. Pitt had granted an\r\nadvance of L1,200,000 to the emperor without the consent of parliament.\r\nHe was justly blamed for this unconstitutional act, and eighty-one\r\nmembers voted against the government. In his budget of December 7 he\r\nproposed another loan of L18,000,000. The public debt already exceeded\r\nL400,000,000; the 3 per cents. had fallen with its growth, and in\r\nSeptember were at 53. In the dangerous position of the country,\r\nfinanciers would have declined the loan, and Pitt offered it to the\r\npublic at 5 per cent. and L112 10s. stock for L100 money. Liberal as\r\nthese terms may seem, they were exiguous at that critical time, and the\r\nstock was at 4 per cent. discount before the deposit was paid. Pitt,\r\nhowever, appealed to the loyalty of the country. Patriotic enthusiasm\r\nwas aroused, and the \"loyalty loan\" was promptly subscribed. Twenty-nine\r\nnew items of taxation were imposed during the session; one of them\r\nraised the stamp duty on newspapers, which Pitt described as a luxury,\r\nfrom 2d. to 3-1/2d., and was calculated to produce L114,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RELIGIOUS FEUD IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nThe threats of invasion were not vain; a descent on Ireland was\r\nattempted. The government, though withholding emancipation, had made an\r\neffort to conciliate the catholics. While the penal code was in force\r\nIrish priests were educated abroad. Burke held that they required a\r\nspecial education, and that seminaries should be established for them in\r\nIreland as a means of keeping them from disloyalty. The destruction of\r\nthe French seminaries by the republicans left no choice between a\r\npriesthood educated at home and one without education, and therefore\r\nlikely to be dangerous to civil order. Camden met the difficulty by\r\nfavouring the foundation of the college of Maynooth. Religious animosity\r\nhad broken out afresh since the recall of Fitzwilliam, and many outrages\r\nwere committed on both sides. On September 1, 1795, the defenders and\r\npeep-of-day boys fought near a village called Diamond, in Armagh, and\r\nthe defenders were worsted with some slaughter. Immediately afterwards\r\nthe Orange society was founded to maintain the protestant cause. In 1796\r\nprotestant mobs assuming the name of Orangemen, persecuted the catholics\r\nin Armagh, and drove them from their homes, bidding them go \"to hell or\r\nConnaught\". The magistrates gave the catholics little help, and the\r\ngovernment minimised the outrages of the protestants.\r\n\r\nReligious hatred changed the position of parties. The United Irishmen no\r\nlonger attempted to unite men of the two religions; they encouraged the\r\ncatholics to believe that the protestants were determined to destroy\r\nthem and conquer the land for themselves. There was much anarchy.\r\nCatholic disloyalty was increased by the feeling that the government\r\nfavoured the Orangemen, and attacks were made on royal troops in\r\nConnaught. A stringent insurrection act was passed, which gave the\r\nmagistrates power to send on board the fleet those attending unlawful\r\nassemblies or otherwise acting disloyally, and in the autumn the _habeas\r\ncorpus_ act was suspended. Corps of yeomanry and infantry were formed by\r\nthe gentry for their own protection, and were accepted by the crown. The\r\ndefenders coalesced with the United Irishmen, and the society adopted a\r\nmilitary organisation. On different pretexts, such as a potato-digging,\r\nfunerals, or football matches, large bodies of men assembled in military\r\narray; guns were collected, and pike-heads forged. Leading members of\r\nthe United Irishmen pressed the directory to send an expedition to\r\nIreland, representing that the catholic peasantry and the dissenters of\r\nUlster were alike ripe for revolt. Among the most active of these agents\r\nwere Wolfe Tone, Arthur O'Connor, and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, a son of\r\nthe Duke of Leinster, a young man of romantic disposition and no special\r\nabilities, who had married a lady of great beauty, well known in French\r\nsociety, Pamela, supposed to be a daughter of Madame de Genlis by the\r\nDuke of Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe directors appointed Hoche to command an invading force, and a fleet\r\nof seventeen ships of the line, thirteen frigates, and other vessels\r\nsailed from Brest on December 15 with 15,000 troops and a supply of arms\r\nfor distribution. Though an invasion was expected, the fleet met with no\r\nenemy, and evaded a squadron which was on the look-out off Ushant. Some\r\nof the ships, however, were separated from the others, and one of\r\nseventy-four guns was wrecked through the incapacity of the French naval\r\nofficers. On the 21st thirty-five ships of the fleet arrived at the\r\nmouth of Bantry bay, \"in most delicious weather,\" wrote Tone, who\r\naccompanied the expedition. Then the wind changed and blew hard. Only\r\nfifteen ships managed to enter the bay, and five of them were forced by\r\nthe gale to put out to sea again. The ship on which Hoche sailed did not\r\narrive. No landing was effected, and, on January 17, the battered fleet\r\nreturned to Brest, less five ships lost, six captured by some British\r\nships lying at Cork, and one of seventy-four guns, which was attacked on\r\nits way home by two English frigates off Ushant, driven ashore, and\r\nwrecked.\r\n\r\nIf the wind had remained light and favourable, or if the French had been\r\nbetter seamen, and their force had landed, Ireland would probably have\r\nbeen conquered for a time, for the country was drained of regular\r\ntroops. Between Bantry and Cork were only 4,000 men hastily collected at\r\nBandon, and stores and artillery were virtually non-existent. That a\r\nFrench fleet should have been able to leave Brest, remain five days on\r\nthe Irish coast, and return without being attacked by the channel fleet\r\ncaused great alarm in England, and was due to Bridport's slackness. The\r\nIrish of all classes behaved with exemplary loyalty; the country people\r\nafforded every assistance in their power to the troops at Bandon, and no\r\nsymptom of disaffection appeared in Dublin. It was evident that many who\r\nhad joined the disloyal societies had been driven to do so by fear, and\r\nthat the catholics as a body were not as yet ready to revolt.[268]\r\nEither merely to harass England, or to prove the feasibility of a more\r\nserious invasion, two frigates and two other vessels were despatched\r\nfrom Brest in February with about 1,200 men, half of them convicts.\r\nAfter destroying some merchantmen in the Bristol channel, they anchored\r\nin Fishguard bay. The troops landed on the 23rd, and were, it is said,\r\nmuch alarmed through mistaking a body of Welshwomen in their red cloaks\r\nand beaver hats for soldiers. The next day Lord Cawdor, captain of the\r\nPembrokeshire yeomanry, appeared with a force of local troops and\r\ncountry folk, and they at once surrendered. The two frigates which\r\nbrought them were captured on their way back to Brest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUSPENSION OF CASH PAYMENTS._]\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the war, loans and subsidies to foreign princes, and\r\nbills drawn by British agents abroad caused a continual drain of specie\r\nfrom the bank of England. By 1795 the exchange became unfavourable, and\r\nsince then the drain had been enormous. Pitt anticipated taxes and\r\nborrowed heavily. Believing that an invasion was imminent, many small\r\ntradesmen and others were eager to turn their property into cash; a run\r\non country banks set in, and some failed. The bank of England was\r\npressed for gold. On Saturday, February 25, the floating debt owed to it\r\nby government was about L7,500,000, and its stock of coin and bullion,\r\nwhich in 1794 was over L8,500,000, was reduced to L1,272,000; and a\r\nsharp run was expected on Monday. The bank itself, and the private banks\r\nwhich depended on it, were threatened with immediate stoppage, and the\r\nconsequences to the country would have been disastrous. The directors\r\napplied to Pitt. He called the king to London; a privy council was held\r\non Sunday, and an order was issued suspending cash payments at the bank\r\nuntil the will of parliament was expressed. The leading merchants and\r\nbankers at once declared that they would accept bank of England notes.\r\n\r\nCommittees of both houses of parliament reported that the bank was in a\r\nthoroughly stable condition, and, after much debating, during which Fox\r\nasserted that Pitt deserved impeachment for defrauding the public\r\ncreditor, a bill was passed on May 3 prohibiting the bank from issuing\r\ncash, except in sums below L1, until six months after the end of the\r\nwar. Cash payments were not resumed until 1819. A fair, though\r\nconstantly decreasing amount of gold remained in circulation for some\r\nyears, and was supplemented by the issue of one pound notes. The bank\r\nwas moderate in its issues, and, except in 1800, there was no\r\nappreciable difference between the value of its paper and gold until\r\n1808. The government was undoubtedly justified in saving the bank from\r\nthe effects of panic. Whether the suspension should have been continued\r\nafter the restoration of public confidence is another matter. It was\r\ncontinued chiefly because it enabled the bank to make large advances to\r\ngovernment without incurring a drain of bullion. Currency was at once\r\nexpanded, and Pitt obtained a new loan of L14,500,000; it was raised\r\nmainly in the 3 per cents., and created a debt of L175 for each L100\r\ncash. Pitt therefore paid, including the provision for long annuity, at\r\nthe rate of L6 7s. per cent. The imperial loan of L1,620,000 was raised\r\non even more onerous terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF CAPE ST. VINCENT._]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of anxiety and financial depression England was cheered by\r\na great naval victory. France called on Spain to form a junction of\r\nfleets. It was the old idea of 1779 when the two Bourbon powers were to\r\ndestroy the channel fleet and lay England open to invasion. The Spanish\r\nfleet, twenty-seven ships of the line, under Admiral de Cordova, sailed\r\nfrom Carthagena for Cadiz on February 1. Jervis was then cruising off\r\nCape St. Vincent, and before dawn on the 14th he received tidings that\r\nthe Spaniards were near. He had only fifteen ships of the line, but his\r\nsquadron was in splendid order, and among its commanders were Commodore\r\nNelson and Captains Collingwood, Troubridge, and Saumarez. The Spaniards\r\nwere eager to get to port, and ten of their ships were far ahead of the\r\nrest on the leeward side. He made for the gap and attacked the main body\r\nof seventeen ships, keeping the nine lee ships (one had got away) in\r\ncheck meanwhile. After some cannonading and manoeuvring the Spaniards\r\nattempted to join their lee division. They were stopped by Nelson who,\r\non his own responsibility, wore his ship, the _Captain_ (74), took her\r\nout of the line, crossed the bows of five Spaniards, and promptly\r\nsupported by Troubridge in the _Culloden_ (74), engaged the gigantic\r\nSpanish flagship, the _Santisima Trinidad_ (130), and two others. His\r\ndaring manoeuvre threw the enemy into confusion and enabled the\r\nBritish to come to close quarters.\r\n\r\nDuring the fight the _Captain_ was crippled, \"her wheel and foretopmast\r\ngone and not a sail or rope left\". She was engaged by several of the\r\nenemy, particularly by the _San Nicolas_ (80) and the _San Josef_ (112),\r\nwhose mizzen-mast she had shot away. Collingwood pushed his ship, the\r\n_Excellent_ (74), between her and the _San Nicolas_, gave the Spaniard a\r\nbroadside within pistol shot, and passed on. The _San Nicolas_ \"luffing\r\nand the _San Josef's_ mizzen-mast being gone, they fell on board of each\r\nother\". Nelson boarded the _San Nicolas_ and captured her. From her he\r\nand his men boarded the _San Josef_, which also surrendered, and on her\r\ndeck he received the swords of the Spanish officers. Four of the enemy's\r\nships were taken and the _Santisima Trinidad_ surrendered but was not\r\nsecured.[269] The fight lasted until evening, and though the Spaniards\r\nhad ten ships which had not been closely engaged and eight more\r\nuncrippled, they drew off in the night. They showed an utter lack of\r\nseamanship in the action. The number of their fleet, the size and\r\nquality of their ships, and the weight of metal they carried place this\r\nbattle of St. Valentine's Day, or Cape St. Vincent, among the splendid\r\nvictories of the British navy. Its moral effect was excellent; it helped\r\nthe nation to pass through the banking crisis with calmness, and raised\r\nits spirits. The long-standing belief that Spain was a first-rate\r\nmaritime power was destroyed at last. Jervis was created Earl of St.\r\nVincent and received a pension of L3,000 a year, and Nelson, already\r\ngazetted rear-admiral, a pension of L1,000 and the order of the Bath.\r\nAbout the same time Admiral Harvey, commanding in the Leeward islands,\r\nand Sir Ralph Abercromby captured Trinidad from the Spaniards, but\r\nfailed in an attack on Puerto-rico.\r\n\r\nIt was well that England should be encouraged, for darker days were at\r\nhand. The Austrian attempt in Italy in the autumn of 1796 ended in\r\ndisaster. Although Alvinzi beat the French at Caldiero on November 12,\r\nhe was no match for Bonaparte in generalship, and the Austrians were\r\ndefeated in a three days' battle at Arcola on the 15th-17th. A last\r\nattempt to save Mantua was foiled by Bonaparte's victory at Rivoli on\r\nJanuary 14, and on February 2 the great fortress was surrendered by\r\nWurmser. Bonaparte led his victorious army into Carinthia, overcame the\r\nAustrian resistance with the help of Massena and Joubert, and advanced\r\nto Leoben about 100 miles from Vienna. The death of Catherine had\r\ndeprived the emperor of his hopes of help from Russia, and on April 18\r\npreliminaries of peace were signed at Leoben. Francis renounced his\r\nrights over the Netherlands and agreed to a congress for the conclusion\r\nof a peace with the empire. By secret articles he promised to surrender\r\nhis territories west of the Oglio and to accept in exchange the _terra\r\nfirma_ of Venice from the Oglio eastward, with Venetian Dalmatia and\r\nIstria. Lombardy and the rest of the Venetian _terra firma_ were to be\r\nconstituted an independent republic by France, and Venice was to be\r\nindemnified by the Legations, Romagna, Ferrara, and Bologna. The emperor\r\nnegotiated apart from Great Britain and without sending any notice of\r\nhis intentions to London,[270] and England suddenly found herself\r\ndeprived of her one efficient ally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISCONTENT IN THE NAVY._]\r\n\r\nHer enemies were preparing to close in upon her. Three fleets threatened\r\nher with invasion. A French fleet lay at Brest, inadequately watched by\r\nBridport; a Spanish fleet at Cadiz was closely blockaded by Jervis; and\r\nDuncan with the North sea fleet kept watch for a fleet which the Dutch\r\nat the bidding of France were fitting out in the Texel. The safety of\r\nthe realm depended on the navy, and the navy mutinied. Both soldiers and\r\nsailors had just grievances, specially as regards their pay. Seditious\r\npamphlets were distributed among the soldiers by the democratic\r\nsocieties, and, it was believed, among the sailors also.[271] The\r\ndiscontent in the army, which for a time appeared likely to have serious\r\nconsequences, was allayed through the influence of the Duke of York. The\r\npay of privates of the line was raised from 8-1/4d. to 1s. a day,\r\nthough a deduction on account of the existing high price of provisions\r\nreduced the actual increase to 2d.; and other advantages were\r\ngranted.[272]\r\n\r\nThe sailors had no royal duke to speak for them. Mutinies had broken out\r\nsporadically in the navy during the American war and temporary\r\nconcessions had been made, but there was no general removal of\r\ngrievances. The pay remained as it was fixed in the reign of Charles II.\r\nat 22s. 6d. a month (of twenty-eight days) for able seamen and 19s. for\r\nordinary seamen, though the cost of living had risen, the men said, 30\r\nper cent., so that they could not provide for their families. The system\r\non which they were paid was unfair to them; a deduction of two ounces in\r\nthe pound was made in their rations by the admiralty to balance waste of\r\nstores; the medical service was disgracefully bad, and they complained\r\nbitterly of the shameful practice of not providing them with fresh\r\nvegetables as a protection from scurvy when in English ports.\r\nPunishments were sometimes frightfully severe and a tyrannical captain\r\ncould make a ship a floating hell. A mutiny, only remotely connected\r\nwith the general movement, was provoked on the _Hermione_ (32) on the\r\nJamaica station by the insane cruelty of Pigot, the captain; the crew\r\nmurdered him and the other officers, and delivered the ship to the\r\nSpaniards from whom it was afterwards retaken. Owing to the large demand\r\nfor men in war time many crews contained a large number of bad\r\ncharacters, criminals whose sentences were remitted on condition of\r\nentering the navy, and such like, and on some ships there were many\r\nIrishmen who had imbibed disaffection on shore. Such men would naturally\r\nbe inclined to mutiny. A ship's crew, however, took its tone from the\r\nable seamen, the A.B.'s, from whom the petty officers were chosen. At\r\nthat time they were often not more than a fourth of the crew, and\r\nunfortunately they had special grievances. They were skilled men, and\r\nmight have been mates with good pay on a merchant ship. They were forced\r\nto serve in the navy by impressment, and when in port were refused leave\r\nto visit their families for fear they should desert. In the winter of\r\n1796-97 the able seamen in the channel fleet seem to have combined to\r\nobtain a redress of grievances. Anonymous petitions were sent to Lord\r\nHowe, who forwarded them to the admiralty where they were disregarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MUTINY IN THE NAVY._]\r\n\r\nOn April 15 the fleet, which was then at Spithead, was ordered to put to\r\nsea. The crews instead of weighing anchor manned the yards, cheered, and\r\nhoisted the red flag, the usual signal for battle. They were joined by\r\nthe marines. No personal disrespect was shown to the officers, but the\r\nships were taken out of their command. The admiralty board went down to\r\nPortsmouth and held an interview with the delegates from the ships, who\r\npresented a list of their demands. The commissioners haggled; the men\r\nstood firm, and further demanded that officers accused of tyranny should\r\nbe dismissed their ships. On the 25th the commissioners gave way on all\r\npoints; the pay of able seamen was to be the same as that of privates in\r\nthe army, though without deductions, 1s. a day, or a rise of 5s. 6d. a\r\nmonth; ordinary seamen were to receive a rise of 4s. 6d.; their other\r\ngrievances were to be redressed; and a promise was given that the fleet\r\nshould not be sent to sea until the increase of pay had been voted by\r\nthe house of commons, and the king's pardon had been proclaimed. Various\r\nhindrances, which might perhaps have been overcome if the government had\r\nappreciated the need of promptitude, delayed the application to\r\nparliament. Days passed by; the sailors heard nothing of a bill for the\r\nrise in their wages or of a proclamation of pardon, and an ill-judged\r\norder sent by the admiralty to the captains with reference to stores and\r\nto mutinous conduct roused their suspicions. They believed that they had\r\nbeen cajoled. Hitherto their conduct had been as blameless as the nature\r\nof the case allowed. It was so no longer. Two of the ships remained at\r\nSpithead; the rest had gone to St. Helen's. On May 7 all the crews again\r\nmutinied and most of the officers were sent ashore. A struggle took\r\nplace on board the _London_; a mutineer was shot dead, and a midshipman\r\nand a marine officer were wounded. Pitt proposed a grant for the\r\nincrease of pay on the 8th, and, as discussion might be mischievous,\r\nasked for a silent vote. To their shame, Fox and his friends used this\r\ncrisis as an opportunity for a violent party attack on the\r\ngovernment.[273] The money was voted, and on the 10th Howe, the sailors'\r\nfavourite \"Black Dick,\" went down to the fleet with the vote and the\r\nking's proclamation. The men were pacified; more than 100 officers to\r\nwhom they objected were removed from the ships; discipline was restored,\r\nand the fleet put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe admiralty commissioners, after contesting the just demands of the\r\nmen, had yielded to a dangerous point by removing officers at the\r\ndictation of mutineers. Their vacillation encouraged the idea that\r\nmutiny paid, and mutiny accordingly spread. On the 12th it broke out in\r\nthe ships lying at the Little Nore with reinforcements for the North sea\r\nfleet. These ships contained a large number of London roughs and some\r\ndisaffected Irishmen. Unlike the mutiny at Spithead, it was a violent\r\nand criminal movement. It was directed by Richard Parker, a seaman of\r\nsome education on board the _Sandwich_ (90), who is said to have entered\r\nthe navy as a midshipman, to have been dismissed his ship for\r\nimmorality, and as mate to have been broken for insubordination; he had\r\nbeen imprisoned for debt at Perth, and had volunteered for the navy in\r\norder to obtain his release. Delegates were chosen; the red flag was\r\nhoisted, and the officers were deprived of command. From the first an\r\nelement of weakness existed in the movement, for the men were not\r\nunanimous; two loyal frigates were forced to join the mutiny, and there\r\nwas a loyal minority on the others. The squadron moved out to the Great\r\nNore, and the mutineers paraded Sheerness with a red flag. Lord Spencer\r\nand his colleagues went down to Sheerness and had an interview with the\r\ndelegates; they failed to persuade them to return to their duty, and\r\nParker treated them with insolence. Besides the demands made by the\r\nchannel fleet, which were already granted, the mutineers required that\r\nno officer that had been removed from his ship should again be employed\r\nin her without the consent of the ship's company, and that the articles\r\nof war should be revised. Demands of that kind, of course, could not be\r\ndiscussed. The first sign of weakness in the movement appeared on the\r\n29th; the two loyal frigates left the squadron and, though fired on by\r\nthe rest, made good their escape. The mutineers, however, soon received\r\nan accession of strength which encouraged them to proceed to further\r\nacts of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny spread to Duncan's fleet then in Yarmouth Roads. The men knew\r\nthat the Dutch fleet was preparing for an invasion of the kingdom, and\r\nthey left the way open. All the ships, save Duncan's flagship and one\r\nother, deserted him and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Nevertheless,\r\nthe stouthearted admiral sailed with his two ships to his station off\r\nthe Texel, determined if the Dutch came out to fight them. While there\r\nhe concealed his weakness from the enemy by making signals as though his\r\nfleet lay in the offing. England was in imminent danger, and Count\r\nVorontsov (Woronzow), the tsar's ambassador, directed the Russian\r\nsquadron, then at Yarmouth and under orders for home, to delay its\r\ndeparture and join Duncan until he could be reinforced from Spithead,\r\nthe greatest service, wrote Grenville, that England has ever received\r\nfrom any nation.[274] Happily, the Dutch fleet was not ready to put to\r\nsea. The mutinous crews attempted to intimidate the government by\r\nblockading the Thames, and trading vessels were stopped at the entrance\r\nof the river. Some officers were ill-treated. Farmhouses on the coast\r\nwere sacked. The country was greatly alarmed, and the 3 per cents. fell\r\nto a trifle over 48. The government acted with vigour; the garrison at\r\nSheerness was strongly reinforced; furnaces for heating shot were made\r\nready in the forts on the Thames; gunboats were fitted out, and the\r\nbuoys at the mouth of the river were taken up to prevent the escape of\r\nthe mutineers. In response to a royal message, parliament passed bills\r\non June 3 and 6 providing that incitement to mutiny should be punishable\r\nwith the highest penalties of misdemeanour, and that intercourse with\r\nthe mutinous ships should be a capital felony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NAVAL DISCIPLINE RESTORED._]\r\n\r\nThe mutineers \"ordered\" captain Lord Northesk, who was virtually\r\nimprisoned on his ship, to go to London and lay their demands before the\r\nking. An official answer was returned requiring unconditional surrender.\r\nThey grew uneasy, and their doubts of success were increased by\r\naddresses sent from the seamen of the channel fleet, severely\r\nreprobating their conduct. Cut off from communication with the shore and\r\nwithout hope of support from the channel fleet, they soon lost heart\r\naltogether. Parker became unpopular. Ship after ship either left the\r\nsquadron or signalled a return to obedience, and finally, on the 14th,\r\nthe crew of the _Sandwich_ brought her under the battery at Sheerness,\r\nand surrendered Parker. He was tried by a court-martial, and hanged at\r\nthe yard-arm of his ship. About forty were condemned to death, and some\r\nothers were flogged. The government was inclined to mercy, for the bulk\r\nof the men had been deluded by Parker and other scoundrels; only\r\nfourteen seamen and four marines were executed; the other condemned men\r\nwere pardoned by the king after the next great naval victory.\r\n\r\nA mutinous spirit appeared in other divisions of the navy. The squadron\r\nat the Cape was brought to order by Lord Macartney, the governor, who\r\nthreatened to sink the ship most forward in the movement by bombarding\r\nher from the shore. One of the ships off Cadiz began a mutiny; St.\r\nVincent, a rigid disciplinarian, though, as the men knew, careful for\r\ntheir welfare, was equal to the occasion; the ringleader was sentenced\r\nby a court-martial, and St. Vincent surrounded the ship with gunboats,\r\nand forced the crew to hang him themselves, and that on a Sunday\r\nmorning, which, being against all precedent, deeply impressed the\r\nsailors. Convinced that the idleness attending a long blockade was bad\r\nfor discipline, he kept his ships employed as much as possible, and, in\r\nJuly, detached a squadron under Nelson to attack Santa Cruz. The attack\r\nwas unsuccessful, and cost Nelson his right arm. England never passed\r\nthrough darker days than those of the mutinies.[275] The lessons they\r\nteach are that a country which neglects the legitimate grievances of its\r\ndefenders pursues a course not less perilous than shabby; and that\r\nmutinous conduct of every kind should at once be met with exemplary\r\nseverity. Neither impressment nor flogging was included in the seamen's\r\ngrievances, but they complained of unjust treatment by officers. Since\r\n1797 their condition steadily though slowly improved, and they were\r\ntreated both by their officers and the admiralty with more of the\r\nconsideration to which their splendid services entitled them. To Nelson\r\nthe health and contentment of his seamen were always matters of care and\r\npride.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NEGOTIATIONS AT LILLE._]\r\n\r\nPitt, seeing England destitute of efficient allies, threatened with\r\ninvasion, short of money, burdened with debt and taxation, with public\r\ncredit at a low ebb, and with her fleets in mutiny, was set on peace, if\r\nit could be had on reasonable terms. He was encouraged by the state of\r\nparties in France, for in May the moderates or royalists who desired to\r\nput an end to the war gained a majority in the legislative councils. On\r\nJune 1 the government proposed a negotiation for preliminaries of a\r\npeace which should be definitely arranged at a future congress. The\r\nproposal was rejected by the directors, who would not allow any concert\r\nbetween Great Britain and Austria, or any discussion of the general\r\ninterests of Europe, and insisted that England should negotiate for a\r\ndefinite and separate peace. Grenville considered that this would be\r\nhumiliating to England, and would have resigned rather than consent to\r\nit if he had not felt it his duty not to embarrass the government. The\r\nking heartily agreed with him, and so did Lord Liverpool (Hawkesbury)\r\nand Windham.[276] Pitt was too strong for them, and Malmesbury was sent\r\nto meet the French commissioners at Lille. He had scarcely arrived there\r\nwhen Burke, who by voice and pen had so long warned England to have no\r\npeace with France, died on July 9. Here, wrote Canning, \"there is but\r\none event, but that is an event for the world--Burke is dead\". One of\r\nthe five French directors was a constitutional royalist, another,\r\nCarnot, was inclined to that side, the other three were jacobins. A\r\nstruggle was impending between this jacobin triumvirate and the majority\r\nin the councils. The success of Malmesbury's mission depended on its\r\nissue. England's need of peace may be gauged by Pitt's offers of the\r\nrecognition of the French sovereignty over Belgium, Luxemburg, Savoy,\r\nand Nice, of the cession of all her conquests from France, Spain, and\r\nHolland, except Trinidad and the Cape, and of an exchange for Ceylon. In\r\nthe discussions of the cabinet Grenville opposed Pitt's pacific policy,\r\nand as he found that the contents of Malmesbury's despatches became\r\nknown out of doors, and that Pitt was enabled to support his opinions by\r\nthe opinions of others, he arranged that Malmesbury's specially secret\r\ncommunications should be withheld from his colleagues generally, and\r\nthey were only seen by himself, Pitt, and Canning,[277] the\r\nunder-secretary for foreign affairs. Difficulties were raised by the\r\nFrench as to the royal style \"King of Great Britain and France,\" the\r\nrestitution of, or an equivalent for, the ships taken or destroyed at\r\nToulon, and the retention of any conquests from the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were prolonged, for Malmesbury hoped that the majority\r\nin the councils would prove stronger than the triumvirate, and the\r\ntriumvirs would not break them off before they had secured their\r\nposition. During their progress Portugal, England's sole remaining ally,\r\nmade a separate peace. A _coup d'etat_ was effected by the army on\r\nSeptember 4 (18th Fructidor); the royalist and moderate deputies were\r\ncondemned to transportation, two new directors were chosen, and the\r\njacobin, or war party, was established in power. New commissioners were\r\nsent to Lille, and on the 14th Malmesbury was asked if he would agree to\r\nthe restitution of every conquest made from France and her allies. He\r\nreplied that that was beyond his powers, and was ordered to depart in\r\ntwenty-four hours. After this abrupt termination of Malmesbury's mission\r\nthe former friendly and confidential relations between Pitt and\r\nGrenville were fully restored. The _coup d'etat_ baffled Pitt's efforts.\r\nIt was followed by the conclusion of a definite peace between France and\r\nthe emperor, which destroyed all hope of a concert between Great Britain\r\nand Austria. After the preliminaries of Leoben, Bonaparte declared war\r\non Venice, procured the overthrow of its ancient constitution, and\r\nestablished a new municipality. By the treaty of Campo Formio, concluded\r\nOctober 17, he betrayed the Venetians by handing over their city to\r\nAustria, along with Istria, Dalmatia, and the Venetian _terra firma_ as\r\nfar west as the Adige, while France took the Ionian islands for herself.\r\nThe emperor resigned the Belgic provinces, and by a secret article\r\npromised to use his influence in the empire to secure to France the left\r\nbank of the Rhine. The directors looked forward to an invasion of\r\nEngland. While her navy was engaged with the fleets of Spain and\r\nHolland, a French force was to cross the channel and march on London;\r\nIreland would revolt; England would accept a democracy, and Tipu would\r\ndestroy her power in India.[278]\r\n\r\nThe futility of their arrogant hopes was already exhibited. Another\r\ninvasion of Ireland was planned in the spring. A Dutch fleet was to\r\ncarry over a land force, and was to be followed by Hoche and the Brest\r\nfleet. The United Irishmen eagerly expected a French invasion. Though\r\nthe Dutch fleet was not ready until the crisis of the mutinies was over,\r\nDuncan's force was still small. Week after week the wind prevented the\r\nDutch from leaving the Texel. Provisions ran short, and Duncan's fleet\r\nwas again in force. The great opportunity had passed by. Fresh plans\r\nwere made for descents on Ireland and Scotland in concert with a French\r\nexpedition; but the hopes of the United Irishmen received a further blow\r\nin the death of Hoche. At last, on October 6, the Dutch fleet left the\r\nTexel.\r\n\r\nDuncan received the news at Yarmouth on the 9th, and on the 11th came up\r\nwith the enemy off Camperdown. In number of ships the fleets were about\r\nequal, but the British were the stronger. Duncan attacked in two\r\ndivisions, broke through the Dutch line in two places and engaged to\r\nleeward, cutting them off from their coast. He signalled for each ship\r\nto engage its opponent, as in Howe's action of the First of June.\r\nMistakes led to a concentration of force on the Dutch rear, which had\r\ngood results.[279] The Dutch fought with splendid courage, and the\r\ncarnage on both sides was terrible. Nine Dutch ships, including the\r\n_Vrijheid_ (74), the flagship of their admiral, De Winter, were taken.\r\nThe shattered remainder of their fleet put back into the Texel. The\r\nBritish admiral was created Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, and received\r\na pension of L3,000 a year. The victory was of incalculable importance.\r\nThree fleets threatened the kingdom, and Camperdown, as Grenville said,\r\nbroke the right wing of the invasion.[280] It raised the spirits of the\r\nnation. Won by the fleet so lately in mutiny, it proved that England\r\ncould again, as of old, rely on the loyalty of her navy. It reasserted\r\nher supremacy at sea, which, in spite of the victories of Howe and\r\nJervis, seemed weakened by the evacuation of the Mediterranean and the\r\nmutinies. Supreme at sea, she carried the trade of the world. Since the\r\ngreat drop of 1793 her commerce had increased year by year until it\r\nagain declined in 1797. From that year, fostered by the demands of war\r\nand fed by the activity of British manufactures, it increased with\r\nextraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SECESSION FROM PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nIn parliament the opposition gained no ground. On May 26, Grey again\r\nbrought forward the question of reform, and this time propounded a\r\nscheme. He proposed that the counties should return 113 instead of 92\r\nmembers, that they should be divided into districts each with one\r\nmember, and that the franchise should be extended to leaseholders and\r\ncopyholders, that in boroughs householders only should have votes, that\r\npolls should be held simultaneously, and that, if possible, no one\r\nshould record more than one vote; that all landowners, traders, and\r\n\"professors of science\" should be qualified for a seat, and that\r\nparliaments should be triennial. Pitt declared that the country did not\r\ndesire reform, and the motion was lost by 252 to 91. When parliament met\r\nin November, Fox and some of his chief supporters in both houses\r\nseceded, attending only on special occasions. Their conduct was\r\nunconstitutional and ill-advised. It is the duty of a member of\r\nparliament to attend its proceedings, and in the commons his attendance\r\ncan be enforced. Secession is a betrayal of a public trust and a\r\ndeclaration against the constitution. In this case it was partial, and\r\ntherefore specially futile. It caused a division among the little band\r\nof the opposition, and injured the seceders in the opinion of the\r\ncountry; their conduct was considered unpatriotic, and Fox's absence\r\nfrom parliament when the thanks of the house were voted to Duncan was\r\nparticularly blamed. The secession of their leaders gave some whigs of\r\nless standing an opportunity of coming to the front. In Fox's absence\r\nthe remnant of the opposition was led by Tierney, a clever financier and\r\na brilliant speaker with a bitter tongue. From the beginning of the war\r\nconstant motions had been made for peace with France. They were\r\ndiscontinued after 1797; for it was generally recognised that Pitt would\r\ngladly welcome peace. Wit came to the support of the government; Gillray\r\nbitterly caricatured Fox and the opposition, and in November the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_ began its brilliant mockery of democratic principles and\r\npolitics. Its most telling verses were the work of Canning, who entered\r\nthe ministry as under-secretary for foreign affairs in January, 1796.\r\nThe threats of invasion roused the spirit of the country. Danger was no\r\nlonger to be apprehended from English disloyalty; the nation was justly\r\nproud of the achievements of its navy and was full of loyalty and\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nPitt took advantage of this spirit. Parliament met on November 3, and he\r\nbrought in his budget on the 24th. All hope of a speedy termination of\r\nthe war ended with the rupture of the negotiations at Lille. He\r\ntherefore declared that though it was impossible to raise the whole of\r\nthe supplies in the year, it was the duty of the nation to contribute\r\nits full share towards the expenses of the war in order that posterity\r\nmight not be burdened with an unfair accumulation of debt. The service\r\nof the year amounted to L25,500,000, and a deficiency of L19,000,000 had\r\nto be supplied. He proposed to borrow L12,000,000 and to raise\r\nL7,000,000 by taxation, chiefly by a measure generally known as trebling\r\nthe assessed taxes, by which the amounts already charged in respect of\r\nthese taxes were augmented on a scale graduated according to income.\r\nPraiseworthy as his effort was to keep down debt, his plan was open to\r\nserious objection. Assessed taxes are essentially an optional expense,\r\nin that they can be avoided by those who do not choose to incur them.\r\nPitt's plan made the payments of the preceding year an arbitrary\r\nstandard of taxation, increasing them by one quarter to treble and\r\nprogressively to quadruple their amounts. This was really an income tax\r\nin disguise, with the special drawback that it forced those who reduced\r\ntheir style of living to pay on the basis of their former expenditure.\r\nFox returned to parliament to oppose the bill, and in one division the\r\nminority numbered 75. Some feeling was excited against Pitt out of\r\ndoors. When, on December 19, the king and queen went in state to St.\r\nPaul's to return thanks for the three great naval victories won by Howe\r\nover the French, St. Vincent over the Spaniards, and Duncan over the\r\nDutch, Pitt was hooted by the London mob, and as he returned home was\r\nguarded by a party of horse. This outbreak of ill-temper was of no\r\nimportant significance. The nation was fully determined to support the\r\ngovernment in its efforts to maintain the safety and honour of England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[264] _Dropmore Papers_, iii., 25-30, 50.\r\n\r\n[265] _Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution_, i., 178, 201.\r\n\r\n[266] _Dropmore Papers_, iii., 261.\r\n\r\n[267] Perregaux to Lord \"Courton\" [Auckland], July 16, 1796, Rose to\r\nAuckland, July 29, _Auckland Corr._, iii., 350-52; Pitt to Grenville,\r\nJune 23, _Dropmore Papers_, iii., 214.\r\n\r\n[268] Pelham to Duke of York, Sept. 22 and Dec. 26, 1796, and Jan. 4,\r\n1797, Add.

All their vague designs for the extension of French\r\nsupremacy led up to the ruin of the power which they recognised as their\r\nmost formidable enemy. From the Adriatic to the North sea a vast\r\nrepublic was to furnish the armies of France with recruits. Europe was\r\nto be united in a coalition against England. The Mediterranean was to be\r\na French lake. Every port was to be shut against England's ships;\r\nEngland's commerce was to be destroyed and her pride humbled. A quicker\r\nmeans of bringing her into subjection seemed possible. On a foggy night\r\nan army might be carried across the Channel unobserved by her fleet.\r\nWhat a Norman duke had done might be done by a mighty republic, and the\r\nEnglish crown might be lost in a second battle of Hastings. The victors\r\nwould march on London, and be received as deliverers by a people\r\ngroaning under the oppression of \"that monster Pitt\". They failed to\r\nunderstand that Pitt had the nation at his back, and that even the most\r\nviolent whigs would resist to the death an invasion of their country.\r\nThey formed an \"army of England,\" and appointed Bonaparte to command it.\r\nOn his return to Paris in December, 1797, he set himself to prepare for\r\nthe invasion. Transports for over 24,000 men were soon ready at\r\nBoulogne, Ambleteuse, Calais, and Dunkirk, and boat-builders were hard\r\nat work. In February he made a tour of the coast from Etaples to Ostend\r\nand heard what sailors said about the scheme. On the 23rd he told the\r\ndirectors that France could not gain supremacy by sea for some years,\r\nand that without that no operation could be more hazardous than an\r\ninvasion of England, that a surprise was possible only in the long\r\nwinter nights, and that their naval preparations were too backward for\r\nsuch an attempt to be made that year.[281] He turned to other projects\r\nof conquest which might lead to the destruction of England's commerce in\r\nthe east and of her power in India. For some while longer he ostensibly\r\ndevoted himself to preparations for invasion. The \"army of England,\"\r\nwhich in April numbered 56,000 men, was quartered in the towns of the\r\nnorth, and every port from Havre to the Texel was crowded with\r\ntransports. But by that time the army had lost its commander and the\r\ngreat scheme was definitely abandoned. Nevertheless, the directors\r\ndetermined to be ready if an opportunity for invasion should occur, and\r\nmaritime preparations were continued. In May a flotilla from Havre\r\nattacked the islands of St. Marcouf, which had been seized by Sir Sidney\r\nSmith in 1795, and was beaten back by the little garrison. Equally\r\nfeeble efforts were made by England to check the preparations for\r\ninvasion. On tidings that the transports built at Flushing were to be\r\nconveyed to Ostend by canal in order to avoid the British fleet, a force\r\nof 1,200 men was sent to destroy the sluices of the Bruges canal. They\r\nlanded near Ostend and blew up the great sluice. A storm prevented them\r\nfrom re-embarking and, after a smart engagement, they were all taken\r\nprisoners. If the thing was worth doing, a sufficient force should have\r\nbeen sent to do it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INVASION THREATENED._]\r\n\r\nThe threatened invasion rallied the nation to the support of the\r\ngovernment. Though Fox and the other seceders had ceased to attend\r\nparliament, they kept up an agitation against the ministry. Fox's\r\nbirthday, January 24, was celebrated by a public dinner. The Duke of\r\nNorfolk in proposing his health said that Washington began the war of\r\nindependence with only 2,000 men, yet America was free; he saw that\r\nnumber before him, let them apply his words. He afterwards called on the\r\ncompany to drink \"our sovereign's health, the majesty of the people\".\r\nConsidered in connexion with the circumstances of the time his words\r\nwere in the highest degree seditious. The government, strong in the\r\nsupport of the nation, took up the silly and insolent challenge, and the\r\nduke was deprived of his lord-lieutenancy and the command of his militia\r\nregiment. In May, Fox repeated the toast at a meeting of the whig club.\r\nThe ministers discussed what notice should be taken of his offence. It\r\nis not pleasant to find Pitt considering whether he might be led on to\r\nutter similar words in parliament and be sent to the Tower for the rest\r\nof the session. With all his greatness Pitt lacked the generosity which\r\nwas a redeeming trait in Fox's character. The anxieties of the past\r\nyear, combined with his unfortunate failing, had shaken his health and\r\nhis temper had suffered. It was finally decided that Fox should be\r\nremoved from the privy council, and the king struck his name out of the\r\ncouncil book with his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe belief that the country was in danger evoked patriotic enthusiasm,\r\nand L2,300,000 was subscribed to augment the produce of the triple\r\nassessment. Pitt's supplementary budget announced a further loan of\r\nL3,000,000 and imposed fresh taxes. Chiefly as a means of supporting\r\ncredit he brought forward a scheme for the commutation of the land tax.\r\nFor many years the tax had been granted at four shillings in the pound;\r\nhe proposed to make it perpetual at that rate, to enable landowners to\r\nredeem it, and to apply their payments to the reduction of debt. The\r\nbill, though opposed in both houses on the plea that it was unfair to\r\nthe landed interest, was carried by large majorities. The alien act and\r\nthe suspension of _habeas corpus_ were revived, for with the enemy\r\nthreatening the country disloyalty was intolerable. With a view to the\r\norganisation of defence the government was empowered to ascertain the\r\nnumber of men who were prepared to take up arms in case of invasion, to\r\ninstruct each as to what he should do, and to arrange for the removal of\r\nhelpless persons, cattle, and other property from the coast.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of overwhelming anxiety to the ministers, for, in addition\r\nto the expected invasion, they had to meet rebellion in Ireland. With so\r\ngreat a strain upon him, Pitt was unable to bear with patience the\r\nattempts of Tierney, the leader of the non-seceding section of the\r\nopposition, to thwart his measures. On May 25 he brought in a bill to\r\nabrogate certain exemptions from naval service, and asked the house to\r\npass it through all its stages in one day. Tierney objected, and Pitt\r\naccused him of desiring to obstruct the defence of the country. The\r\nspeaker ruled that the imputation was unparliamentary. Pitt repeated his\r\nwords, haughtily declaring that he would \"neither retract from nor\r\nexplain them\". The next day Tierney sent him a challenge. They met on\r\nSunday afternoon, the 27th, on Putney heath, Pitt accompanied by his\r\nfriend Dudley Ryder, afterwards Lord Harrowby, the paymaster of the\r\nforces, and Tierney by Colonel Walpole. Two shots were exchanged on each\r\nside without effect, Pitt firing his second shot into the air. Honour\r\nwas then declared to be satisfied. Wilberforce, in common with many\r\nother religious people, was much shocked, and gave notice of a motion\r\nagainst duelling by members of the house, but was persuaded to withdraw\r\nit, for Pitt threatened to resign if it was carried. The king expressed\r\nhis disapproval, telling Pitt with characteristic good sense that a\r\npublic man should remember his duty to his country before what was due\r\nto himself. Not until that generation had well-nigh passed away was\r\nduelling virtually extinguished by the condemnation of society. In\r\ncontrast to the lack of moral perception on that point stands the\r\nquickening of the public conscience with reference to the slave trade.\r\nWilberforce again brought in his annual motion for its abolition. It was\r\nseconded by Pitt and vigorously supported by Fox, who pertinently asked\r\nwhy the minister did not use his majority to accomplish the end he\r\nprofessed to desire. It was lost only by four votes. The rest of the\r\nsession was largely taken up by the affairs of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere, as we have already seen, religious animosity strengthened the\r\nparty of rebellion. Its leaders also took advantage of agrarian and\r\nother grievances to allure the peasantry. The catholic peasants were\r\nlittle moved by the questions which weighed with their more educated\r\nneighbours and with the dwellers in towns. They were not enamoured of\r\nthe republican sentiments which appealed to the Ulster presbyterians,\r\nand did not care a straw about parliamentary reform for its own sake,\r\nnor for catholic emancipation. Their motives were more personal. They\r\nwere poor and oppressed. The national parliament, though it refused to\r\ngrant political reforms, had done much to improve the condition of the\r\ncountry by subsidies for promoting manufactures, fisheries, and canals,\r\nand by bounties on exported corn. The financial position of Ireland was\r\nbettered, but the lot of the peasantry grew worse. Corn bounties and the\r\nhigh prices of war time caused a rise in the value of land. Holdings\r\nwere subdivided, and, as the agricultural population was large, were\r\neagerly taken at high rents. The tenants could not make a living,\r\nespecially as they were ignorant and generally thriftless. The chief\r\ncause of their discontent was the system of tithe which pressed heavily\r\non the small cultivators. They believed that a reformed parliament would\r\nrid them of that intolerable burden. Finding that reform was withheld,\r\nthey readily listened to men who bade them look for relief to France,\r\nwhere tithe had been abolished. High rents, exacted by the agents of\r\nabsentee landlords or by middle-men, who rented large tracts of land and\r\nsublet them in small holdings, were another though lesser grievance from\r\nwhich they hoped to be delivered by revolution. Sentiment urged them in\r\nthe same direction. Proud and sensitive they resented the dominance of\r\nan alien race; they held the wrongs of their forefathers in remembrance,\r\nand looked back with mournful longing to the age, invested by their\r\npoetic imagination with glory and happiness, when Ireland was yet\r\nunconquered. The United Irishmen told them that a fresh conquest would\r\nbe attempted, that the Orangemen, encouraged by government, designed to\r\nrob them of their land and destroy them. They looked to France for\r\nprotection and were ready to take up arms against the crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REBELLION FOILED IN ULSTER._]\r\n\r\nThe government was determined to nip rebellion in the bud, and struck\r\nfirst at conspiracy in Ulster, where it was mainly engineered by\r\nprotestant leaders. In the spring of 1797 the province was almost in\r\nopen revolt. Martial law was proclaimed, and on May 18 soldiers were\r\nempowered to act without authority from a civil magistrate. An active\r\nsearch was made for arms. It was carried out mainly by yeomanry and\r\nmilitia, for the regular troops were few and mostly stationed in towns.\r\nThe catholic districts were ruthlessly harried. A fierce resistance was\r\nmade. Many outrages were committed by the soldiers, specially by a Welsh\r\nregiment of mounted fencibles, the Ancient Britons. Houses were burned\r\nand peasants were slaughtered. Crowds were imprisoned without process of\r\nlaw and many were sent off to serve in the fleet. These severities which\r\nlasted for several months crushed the life out of the conspiracy in\r\nUlster. The government was justified in using force to suppress\r\nrebellion, but it was lamentable that the work should have been\r\nentrusted to troops which were little better than banditti. An earnest\r\nattempt was made to restrain them by Sir Ralph Abercromby, who succeeded\r\nLord Carhampton as commander-in-chief in November. He issued an order\r\ndeclaring that the army was in a state of \"licentiousness,\" and\r\nforbidding soldiers to act without the civil authority. This order was\r\ncontrary to the proclamation of May 18, and gave great offence to the\r\nparty of repression in the Irish government headed by Lord Clare, and to\r\nthe British ministry. A proclamation of March 30, 1798, re-established\r\nmartial law; Abercromby resigned his command, and was succeeded by\r\nGeneral Lake.\r\n\r\nThe British government upheld the Irish ministers. Early in 1797 the\r\nPrince of Wales wished the king and Pitt to send him to Ireland as\r\nlord-lieutenant to carry out a policy of concession. If he had been\r\nwholly different from what he was, such a step, though it would not\r\nperhaps have averted the coming rebellion, would have probably rendered\r\nit less formidable by detaching some of the leaders of the conspiracy.\r\nThe prince was not a man to be trusted, and his offer was refused. The\r\ninternal affairs of Ireland were not under English direction; the\r\nministers knew nothing of them except through reports from the castle\r\nand left them to the Irish government. Addresses in favour of\r\nconciliation were moved in the lords by the prince's friend, Lord Moira,\r\nan Ulster magnate, and in the commons by Fox. They were resisted as\r\nattacks on the government and were rejected. Moira laid the excesses of\r\nthe soldiers before the lords in November and again in February, 1798.\r\nThe government refused to credit his accounts, or to interfere with the\r\nmeasures taken by the Irish ministers to suppress rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the conspiracy was reported by informers, of whom there\r\nwas no lack. Great preparations were, as we have seen, made in France\r\nfor a possible invasion of England; the United Irishmen expected that\r\nthe French would land in Ireland in the spring, and an organised army\r\nwas ready to co-operate with them, under the command of Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald. The conspiracy was directed by a committee in Dublin. One of\r\nits leaders, Arthur O'Connor, a priest named O'Coighly, and three more\r\nwere arrested at Margate while on their way to France to make further\r\narrangements. O'Coighly was hanged for treason. Fox, Sheridan, and other\r\nmembers of the opposition bore witness to O'Connor's character, and he\r\nand the rest were acquitted. He was arrested on another charge and was\r\nsent to Dublin. After the rebellion he, in common with the other\r\npolitical prisoners, gave evidence as to the conspiracy, and they were\r\neventually released. No government is worthy of the name that sits still\r\nand allows conspiracy to ripen unchecked. The Irish government did not\r\ndo so. It adopted measures of repression which wrecked the plans of the\r\nconspirators and caused secret conspiracy to break prematurely into open\r\nrebellion. It was thus enabled to put an end to a prolonged state of\r\ndanger before it could be augmented by the anticipated foreign invasion.\r\nIt struck swiftly at the heads of the conspiracy. In pursuance of\r\ninformation from an officer of the rebel army named Reynolds, fifteen of\r\nthem were arrested together in Dublin on March 12. Fitzgerald escaped\r\nfor the time. A reward of L1,000 was offered for his detection, and in\r\nMay his hiding-place was betrayed. He made a desperate resistance,\r\nmortally wounded one of the officers sent to take him, and was himself\r\nwounded in the arm. He was conveyed to prison, where he died on June 4.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSIVE SEVERITIES._]\r\n\r\nThe government having crushed the head of rebellion in Ulster, proceeded\r\nto combat it in the midland and southern counties, where it was\r\ndistinctly a catholic movement. Officers were ordered to enforce\r\ndisarmament by summary methods; martial law was established, and they\r\nwere enjoined to distribute their troops at free quarters where arms\r\nwere supposed to be concealed. Scenes of cruelty sickening to\r\ncontemplate followed. As soon as a district was proclaimed, troops took\r\nup free quarters in it, burned every house where a weapon was\r\ndiscovered, shot men without trial of any kind, put many to cruel\r\ntorture either on suspicion of concealing arms or to extort evidence,\r\nand excited the bitterest feelings of revenge by outrages on women,\r\ncutting the petticoats from the backs of girls who showed any sign of\r\nsympathy with rebellion, such as wearing, it might be accidentally, a\r\ngreen ribbon. Men were commonly tortured by floggings of fearful\r\nseverity, or by half-hanging. In imitation of the French republicans,\r\nthe rebel party cut their hair short, and it was a pastime with the\r\nsoldiers to torture \"croppies\" by fixing a covering lined with hot\r\npitch, a \"pitch-cap,\" on their heads, which could not be removed without\r\ntearing the scalp. More than one man died under the lash, and one from\r\nfear of the torture. No name is more closely associated with these\r\nhorrors than that of Thomas Judkin Fitzgerald, high-sheriff of\r\nTipperary. Resolute, courageous, and energetic, he united with some fine\r\nqualities a violent temper and an insensibility to human suffering.\r\nConspiracy was rife in Tipperary, and he was determined to stamp it out.\r\nOne instance of his cruelties will suffice. A teacher of French named\r\nWright was suspected of treason, and a note of a harmless kind, written\r\nin French, was found on him. Fitzgerald, who could not read it, brutally\r\nassaulted him, declared that he would have him first flogged and then\r\nshot; and failing to obtain a confession from him, caused him to receive\r\n150 severe lashes and had him put in prison, where he lay for some days\r\nwith his wounds uncared for. After the rebellion Wright sued him, and\r\nobtained L500 damages. Fitzgerald's severity and the courage with which\r\nhe acted were effectual; Tipperary remained quiet. The government paid\r\nWright's damages, and Fitzgerald's services were rewarded with a\r\nbaronetcy.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators intended to wait for a French invasion. Their\r\norganisation was deranged by the arrests of March 12. A plan was made\r\nfor seizing the castle and occupying Dublin. The city was proclaimed and\r\nviolent measures of repression were adopted. A new rebel executive was\r\nbroken up by the arrest of two brothers named Sheares, who were\r\neventually hanged as traitors. An outbreak of rebellion was certain; it\r\nwas forced on prematurely by drastic measures of repression. Though\r\nnothing can excuse the barbarities perpetrated under the shield of\r\nso-called martial law, severe repression was certainly necessary.\r\nWithout it the conspiracy would have continued to grow, and a rebellion\r\ncoincident with a foreign invasion would have been in the highest degree\r\ndangerous. The rebels lost their leaders; their movements were paralysed\r\nin some districts and crippled in others; they saw no hope except in an\r\nimmediate outbreak, and were driven to it by intolerable severities. So\r\nfar the system pursued by the government was successful. Yet in some\r\ndistricts the terror and rage it excited stimulated rebellion, and when\r\nrebellion broke out led to horrible reprisals. The rising began on an\r\nappointed day, May 23. Attacks were made on the garrisons at Naas,\r\nClane, and other places in Kildare. Nearly everywhere they were repulsed\r\nwith heavy loss, the catholics among the militia and yeomanry behaving\r\nwith perfect loyalty. It was a sanguinary struggle. The rebels\r\nsurprised a detachment of the North Cork militia by night, and\r\nslaughtered them, killing many of them in their beds. The troops gave\r\nlittle quarter; rebels taken in arms were commonly flogged, shot, or\r\nhanged without trial. The citizens of Dublin, where the rebels had been\r\nthoroughly cowed by floggings and hangings, were zealous in preparing to\r\ndefend their city. On the south-west small bodies of troops routed the\r\nrebels with heavy loss at Carlow and Hacketstown. The communications of\r\nDublin were secured on the north by a loyalist victory at Tara, where,\r\non the 26th, about 400 yeomanry and fencibles defeated ten times their\r\nnumber of rebels, and on the west by another victory. By the 31st the\r\nrebels in Meath, Kildare, and Carlow had lost all heart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WEXFORD REBELLION._]\r\n\r\nBy that time rebellion had broken out in the county of Wexford. There it\r\nsoon took the form of a religious war, though the catholic troops\r\nremained faithful to their colours. There were only 600 regular troops\r\nand militia in the county, the loyalist force being composed chiefly of\r\nyeomanry, who were generally protestants. With and without the approval\r\nof the magistrates, they had begun to practise the usual methods of\r\nenforcing disarmament, burning houses and flogging and half-hanging\r\nsuspected persons, and though these severities had not as yet been\r\npractised so widely as in some other districts, they excited violent\r\nterror and resentment. Led by a priest, Father John Murphy, whose house\r\nor chapel had been burnt, the rebels defeated a small number of militia\r\nat Oulart, and attacked Enniscorthy with a force of about 7,000 men.\r\nThere and elsewhere they drove horses and cattle in front of them to\r\ndisorder the ranks of their opponents. After a stout defence the\r\nsurvivors of the little garrison fled to Wexford, whither the loyal\r\ninhabitants of the neighbourhood were flocking for protection. The rebel\r\narmy, swelled to the number of 15,000, advanced on the town. An attempt\r\nto relieve it having failed, the garrison made terms and evacuated the\r\nplace, which was occupied by the enemy on the 30th. The rebels chose\r\nBagenal Harvey, a protestant gentleman and one of the United Irishmen,\r\nas commander-in-chief, and leaving a garrison in Wexford, established a\r\ncamp on Vinegar hill. Hoping to penetrate into Carlow and join the\r\nrebels there and in Wicklow and Kildare, they detached 5,000 men to take\r\nNewtownbarry. Colonel L'Estrange, who commanded there, retreated with\r\nthe garrison, and the rebels rushed into the place. He was soon\r\npersuaded to return, surprised them as they were pillaging, and routed\r\nthem with the loss of only two men.\r\n\r\nIn the camp on Vinegar hill priests were dominant; mass was said every\r\nmorning, and the fury of the people was excited by violent sermons.\r\nProtestants were brought in from the surrounding country, and all who\r\ndid not receive \"protections\" from the priests were butchered, sometimes\r\nwith ghastly cruelty. Though the priests often interfered to save the\r\ncaptives, it is probable that at least 400 were slain in the camp.[282]\r\nThe prime object of the rebel leaders was to establish communication\r\nwith other counties. Their plans were ruined by lack of discipline and\r\norganisation, as well as by the extraordinary gallantry of the loyalist\r\ntroops. After some fighting a detachment of rebels took Gorey in the\r\nnorth of the county. Instead of pressing on into Wicklow, they remained\r\nthere feasting and plundering the neighbourhood. At the same time a\r\nlarge body under Harvey marched on New Ross, with the object of opening\r\ncommunication with Kilkenny and Waterford, where they believed that\r\nthousands were ready to rise in arms.[283] The town was attacked at\r\ndaybreak on June 5, and was defended by General Johnston and about 1,600\r\nmen against thousands of rebels. Again and again the garrison, beaten\r\nback for a time by sheer weight of numbers, rallied and steadily faced\r\nthe enemy. Lord Mountjoy was killed as he led a charge of militia. The\r\nrebels fought desperately, but as a mere mob. After a fierce struggle of\r\nten hours they turned and fled through the burning town. No quarter was\r\ngiven. At least 2,000 of them were slain. The loss on the loyalist side\r\nwas 230. During the battle some rebels fled to Scullabogue House, where\r\ntheir army had left 224 prisoners, nearly all protestants, under a\r\nstrong guard. They declared that the day was lost, that the garrison\r\nwere slaughtering the catholics, and that Harvey had ordered that the\r\nprisoners should be killed. Thirty-seven were massacred at the hall\r\ndoor, and 184, including some women and children, were shut into a barn\r\nand burned to death. Out of the whole number only three escaped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF ARKLOW._]\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat at New Ross, Harvey, who tried in vain to check the\r\nsavagery of his followers, was deposed from his command, and was\r\nsucceeded by a priest named Philip Roche. The rebels at Gorey had been\r\nwasting their time. They were largely reinforced, and on the 9th some\r\n10,000 men attacked Arklow. Its capture would have thrown open the road\r\nto Dublin. The garrison under General Needham numbered about 1,500, and\r\nhad some cannon. Mainly owing to the splendid courage of the Durham\r\nfencibles they defeated the rebels, who were much discouraged by the\r\nfall of one of their priests, for they believed that he and some of\r\ntheir other priestly leaders could not be harmed by shot or sword. Their\r\ndefeat decided the issue of the rebellion. It was almost confined to\r\nLeinster. Connaught remained quiet, and it scarcely touched Munster. In\r\nUlster, the chief seat of the conspiracy, there were only two outbreaks,\r\nin Antrim and Down, which were easily suppressed. Severity had nipped\r\nrebellion in the bud. Nor was this the only reason for the comparative\r\ninaction of the province. The presbyterians, whose republican sympathies\r\nhad led them to look to France and seek the support of the catholics\r\nagainst England, found France fail them again and again; and they were\r\nbitterly incensed against the catholics on hearing how in Wexford they\r\nmade the rebellion a religious war and were torturing and massacring the\r\nprotestants. Nor were French politics any longer such as to allure\r\nrepublicans, for France was rapidly tending towards military rule, and\r\nwas bringing the republics she had founded into subjection to herself.\r\nBefore long Ulster became, as it has since remained, thoroughly loyal to\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion was defeated by the gallantry of the Irish loyalists and\r\nthe few English troops which supported them. No help had as yet been\r\nsent from England. Decisive as the battle of Arklow proved to be, the\r\nIrish ministers believed that the rebellion was still likely to grow,\r\nand wrote urgently for reinforcements. Five regiments were despatched,\r\nand several militia regiments volunteered for service in Ireland. The\r\ncrown could not accept their offer without the consent of parliament.\r\nThe opposition in the commons raised objections, and were defeated by a\r\nlarge majority. On the 21st Lake, at the head of an army of over 13,000\r\nmen, attacked the rebels on Vinegar hill. After a short resistance they\r\nfled in confusion. Enniscorthy was taken, and the royal army marched on\r\nWexford. When the rebels occupied Wexford on May 30, they behaved with\r\ncomparative moderation. There was some pillaging, but few acts of\r\nviolence were committed. Many protestants were imprisoned, and the rest\r\nwere confined to their houses and lived in mortal terror, for the lower\r\nclass of catholics showed a savage spirit which was only kept in check\r\nby their leaders. It broke out on June 20, when nearly all the armed\r\nrebels had marched out against the royal forces. Infuriated by the news\r\nof disasters, the mob, under the leadership of a ruffian named Dixon and\r\nhis equally savage wife, slaughtered ninety-seven of the prisoners. The\r\nnext day the rebels offered to surrender the town on terms. They\r\nbelieved that their offer was accepted, and surrendered before they\r\nheard that Lake refused it. The rebel leaders and all found guilty of\r\nmurder were executed. Philip Roche and, in spite of his humane\r\nexertions, Harvey were among the number. The remains of the rebellion\r\nwere stamped out with fearful severity. Many excesses were committed.\r\nEvery execution was hailed with exultation by the victorious party.\r\nCornwallis, who had succeeded Camden as lord-lieutenant in June, was\r\ndisgusted with their bloodthirsty and vengeful spirit. Seconded by the\r\nchancellor, he obtained from parliament an act of general indemnity with\r\nspecial exceptions, and did all in his power to restrain the ferocity of\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion left Ireland burdened with debt. Throughout wide districts\r\nthe land lay waste, houses were in ashes, the peasants homeless and\r\nstarving. Old racial and religious hatreds were revived and were\r\nstrengthened a thousandfold by the barbarities perpetrated by both\r\nparties. If Ireland was ever to be at peace, if Celts and Saxons,\r\ncatholics and protestants, were ever to dwell together as one people, it\r\ncould only be by her acceptance of the control of a single imperial\r\nparliament. A legislative union had long been contemplated by Pitt and\r\nby other English statesmen. That Pitt deliberately planned and fostered\r\nthe rebellion, as Irishmen have actually asserted, in order to carry out\r\na union is a charge so monstrous as scarcely to demand serious\r\nrefutation. It is enough to say that he would certainly not have chosen\r\nto have Ireland in rebellion at a time so critical for England as the\r\nspring of 1798. That the policy of the government both in England and\r\nIreland, which certainly conduced to the rebellion, was to some extent\r\nswayed by the desire for union is probable.[284] That is quite another\r\nmatter. The rebellion made union absolutely necessary, and while the\r\nrebels were still in arms, Pitt began to prepare for it. The history of\r\nthe union must be deferred to our next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HUMBERT'S INVASION._]\r\n\r\nThe rebels' hopes of help from France were bitterly disappointed. A\r\nserious invasion was impossible without command of the sea; only small\r\nexpeditions could be sent out by stealth. On June 16 certain Irish\r\nconspirators represented that if a small expedition landed on the\r\nnorth-west coast the independence of Ireland might be secured. The\r\ndirectors determined to send one immediately.[285] It was long delayed,\r\nfor the navy was in disorder. At last, on August 6, when the rebellion\r\nwas over, and Ireland was full of troops, General Humbert sailed from\r\nRochelle with eighty-two officers and 1,017 men, together with supplies\r\nand arms for the natives, in three frigates under the command of Captain\r\nSavary. The ships took a long route to avoid the British fleet, and did\r\nnot arrive in Killala bay until the 20th. Killala, which had a garrison\r\nof only 200 men, was occupied, and Ballina was taken. The French were\r\njoined by a large number of Irish, delighted at receiving arms, clothes,\r\nand food. Many of these recruits deserted, carrying away their guns, and\r\nthose who remained were of little use. General Hutchinson, who commanded\r\nin Connaught, advanced against the invaders. He was joined by Lake, and\r\ntheir forces amounted to over 5,000 men. Lake posted a detachment to\r\nguard Castlebar. Humbert avoided it by crossing the mountains, and on\r\nthe 27th, after a march of fifteen hours engaged the British, though\r\nvastly inferior to them in number. The militia were seized with panic,\r\nand though the artillery behaved well, the army was utterly routed and\r\nfled in disorder leaving nine guns in the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\nAfter this shameful rout, called \"the race of Castlebar,\" Cornwallis\r\ntook the command in person at the head of a large army, and reached the\r\nneighbourhood of Castlebar on September 4. Early on that day Humbert\r\nleft Castlebar to march on Sligo, for he heard that there were few\r\ntroops in the counties of Sligo and Leitrim. He probably intended to\r\nmaintain himself near the sea in order to meet reinforcements from\r\nFrance, and is said to have hoped to reach Dublin by a circuit to the\r\nnorth-east. Wild as this hope seems, it was encouraged by the news of\r\ninsurrectionary movements. On reaching Colooney he was met by Colonel\r\nVereker with a small force from Sligo, which he defeated after a smart\r\nengagement. He abruptly changed his course and marched to the\r\nsouth-east, either because he believed that Vereker's force was the\r\nvanguard of an army, or because he hoped to take advantage of a\r\nrebellion which had broken out in Granard, and of disaffection in\r\nLongford and Westmeath, and to reach Dublin through those counties.[286]\r\nOn the 9th Lake attacked him with an overwhelming force at Ballinamuck,\r\nnear Granard; Cornwallis was marching on his rear, and after a short\r\nresistance the French surrendered themselves prisoners. They then\r\nnumbered ninety-six officers and 748 men. No terms were granted to their\r\nIrish allies of whom 500 are said to have been slain. The adventure,\r\ngallantry, and achievements of Humbert's little band form a notable\r\nepisode in the military history of France. Their conduct was worthy of\r\ntheir country, for they committed no excesses. Killala was retaken from\r\nthe rebels with great slaughter and the rebellion in Connaught was soon\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under General Hardy, which was to have sailed to support\r\nHumbert, was prevented from leaving Brest by the British fleet. From\r\nDunkirk a brig got away on September 4, carrying Napper Tandy and some\r\nother United Irishmen, a few soldiers, and stores. Tandy persuaded the\r\nFrench that he was a man of importance in Ireland, and that if he\r\nappeared there the people would rise in arms; so the French made him a\r\ngeneral, and gave him command of this little expedition. He reached the\r\nisland of Aran, in Donegal, on the 16th, and heard of Humbert's failure.\r\nNo one paid any heed to him. He read the letters in the post office,\r\nhoisted a green flag, got very drunk, and was carried back to the brig\r\neight hours after landing. The brig sailed to the coast of Norway to\r\navoid capture. Finally Tandy and some of his friends took refuge in\r\nHamburg. The city delivered them up to the English and thereby incurred\r\nthe wrath of Bonaparte. They were sentenced to death but were not\r\nexecuted, and Tandy was allowed to go to France, where he ended his\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS ON IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nAt last, on September 16th, Hardy succeeded in sailing out from the Raz\r\nwith 4,000 troops for the relief of Humbert. They were carried in the\r\n_Hoche_ (80) and nine smaller ships, under Admiral Bompard. The French\r\ntook a wide course and arrived off Lough Swilly on October 10. They were\r\nmet the next day by Sir John Warren with three ships of the line and\r\nfive frigates. The French, who fought well, were overpowered. The\r\n_Hoche_ and three of their frigates surrendered, and three more of their\r\nvessels were caught during the next few days. Only two frigates and a\r\nsloop returned to Brest. On the _Hoche_ was Wolfe Tone, who had embarked\r\nas a French officer. He was tried by court-martial in Dublin and\r\nsentenced to be hanged. His request that he might die a soldier's death\r\nwas refused; he cut his throat and died in prison. Of all the promoters\r\nof the rebellion he was, perhaps, the most talented, and was excelled by\r\nnone either in courage or in whole-hearted devotion to the cause of\r\nIrish independence. One more attempt at invasion was made by Savary, who\r\nafter landing Humbert's force had returned to France. Ignorant of the\r\nfate of Humbert's expedition, he sailed from Rochelle on October 12 with\r\nthree frigates and a corvette, carrying 1,090 troops, and appeared off\r\nKillala on the 27th. There he heard of the failure of both Humbert and\r\nBompard. He set sail again and was so hotly chased by some British ships\r\nthat he threw guns, stores, and ammunition overboard.[287] His ships got\r\naway, though with some damage, and returned to Rochelle. So ended the\r\nFrench attempts on Ireland. If in the height of the rebellion a small\r\nexpedition had succeeded, as Humbert did, in evading the British fleet\r\nand had landed in Ireland, it might have prolonged the struggle, but\r\ncould not have changed its issue. Disorganisation and unreadiness\r\nprevented France from seizing the opportunity of doing even so much as\r\nthat. In the face of England's superiority at sea the despatch of any\r\nlarge force would have ended in signal disaster. Independently of the\r\nrisk of capture at sea, the little secret expeditions to which France\r\nwas reduced were a mere waste of money.\r\n\r\nBonaparte sailed from Toulon on May 19, intending to take Malta, conquer\r\nEgypt, despoil England of her power and commerce in the east, and gain\r\nfor France exclusive possession of the Red sea. He had with him 35,000\r\ntroops, and a fleet, which finally amounted to thirteen ships of the\r\nline, fourteen frigates, and a vast number of smaller vessels, under the\r\nsubordinate command of Admiral Brueys. Malta was surrendered by the\r\nknights of St. John. Bonaparte took Alexandria on July 2, and defeated\r\nthe Mamelukes in the battle of the Pyramids on the 21st. Lower Egypt was\r\nconquered. As the port of Alexandria was unsuitable for his fleet,\r\nBrueys stationed it in Abukir bay, near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile,\r\nin order to guard the rear of the army. So far Bonaparte's schemes were\r\nsuccessful. But they had been formed without taking the British navy\r\ninto account. Nelson again entered the Mediterranean. Acting on orders\r\nfrom the admiralty, St. Vincent sent him thither, and by June 7 he was\r\nin command of thirteen ships of seventy-four, and the _Leander_ of fifty\r\nguns. He at once began a long search for the French fleet, in which he\r\nwas hindered through lack of frigates to do scouting work. He anchored\r\noff Naples on the 17th, and believing that the enemy would attack\r\nSicily, passed through the straits of Messina, and sailed along the east\r\nof the island. He was off Alexandria on the 28th, two days before the\r\nFrench arrived there, then he searched the Levant, and returned to\r\nSicily for supplies on July 19. On the 25th he put to sea again, sailed\r\nalong the coast of the Morea, and finally on August 1 discovered the\r\nenemy in Abukir bay. The French fleet was anchored in line on the\r\nwestern side of the bay, with wide shoals between it and the shore. It\r\nwas sheltered by Abukir (now Nelson's) island and its rocks, and its\r\nleading ship was pretty close to the shoal off the island. It was\r\ncomposed of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates, and was much\r\nsuperior to Nelson's in the size of the ships and weight of metal. Some\r\nof the ships, however, were worn out, and many of their crews were not\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF THE NILE._]\r\n\r\nThough Troubridge's ship, the _Culloden_, and two others were not with\r\nthe main body, Nelson would not delay his attack, and at 5.30 P.M.\r\nformed his line of battle, the wind being N.N.W. and blowing down the\r\nFrench line. Very skilfully the British ships were taken round the\r\nisland and the shoals. They then swept round, and steering to the\r\nsouth-west headed for the French van about 6.30, led by the _Goliath_\r\nunder Captain Foley. Near as the leading French ship, the _Guerrier_\r\n(74), was to the shoal, Foley passed across her bows, and engaged the\r\nnext ship, the _Conquerant_ (74), on the inshore side. Hood followed\r\nwith the _Zealous_, and anchored by the _Guerrier_, and three more\r\nengaged on the enemy's port side, Nelson's ship, the _Vanguard_, and the\r\ntwo next attacking on the outside. Eight British ships set on the five\r\nof the French van, the two others engaged two Frenchmen of much larger\r\nsize in the centre, and one of them, the _Bellerophon_, was dismasted\r\nand drifted off. Later two of the missing ships of Nelson's squadron and\r\nthe _Leander_ came into action; the _Culloden_ having struck on a rock\r\noff the island, remained aground. By that time the French van was\r\ncrushed, and the battle raged round the centre. Brueys fell, and soon\r\nafterwards his ship, the _Orient_ (120), caught fire. Her assailants\r\npoured so fierce a storm of shot upon her that her crew could not get\r\nthe fire under. The summer night was lightened by the sheet of flame\r\nwhich wrapped her from the water-line to the mast-heads. The fire\r\nreached her magazine, and the great ship blew up with a terrific\r\nexplosion. During the fight Nelson was badly wounded in the forehead. He\r\nwas soon on deck again, and sent boats to pick up the survivors of the\r\ncrew of the _Orient_. The British victory was completed in the morning,\r\nand never was victory so complete. Of seventeen French ships two were\r\nburnt besides the _Orient_, one sank, nine were taken, and only two\r\nships of the line and two frigates escaped.[288] Great was the rejoicing\r\nin England at the news of the battle of the Nile. Nelson was raised to\r\nthe peerage as Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe; other\r\nhonours were conferred on him both at home and by foreign sovereigns,\r\nand parliament voted him a pension of L2,000 a year for two lives.\r\n\r\nThe king's speech on November 20 described the victory as foiling an\r\nenterprise against the most valuable interests of the British empire,\r\nand as likely to lead other powers to combine for the general\r\ndeliverance of Europe. Let us trace its effects under these two\r\nheadings. Bonaparte's conquest of Egypt was designed to be a step\r\ntowards the overthrow of British power and commerce in the east. He\r\nfound himself shut up in his conquest. Great ideas presented themselves\r\nto him. He would take Constantinople, and conquer Europe by a flank\r\nattack. He would be a second Alexander, and after another Issos would\r\ndrive the English from India. Already French envoys were inciting Tipu\r\nSultan to war. From the shores of the Red sea Bonaparte wrote to bid him\r\nexpect his army. The letter was seized by a British ship. Nelson's\r\nvictory encouraged the sultan, Selim III., the nominal lord of Egypt, to\r\ndeclare war. A Turkish army and fleet were assembled at Rhodes, and\r\nanother army in Syria. Bonaparte did not wait to be attacked in Egypt.\r\nThe conquest of Syria would deprive the British fleet of its source of\r\nsupplies in the Levant, and would open the way to a conquest either of\r\nConstantinople or Delhi.[289] On February 15, 1799, he captured El\r\nArish, and on March 6 took Jaffa by storm. Then with an army weakened by\r\ndisease and fighting, he marched on Acre. There he again had to meet a\r\nBritish sea-captain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEFENCE OF ACRE._]\r\n\r\nAfter his distinguished service at Toulon, and some later employment,\r\nSir Sidney Smith, in 1795, was appointed to the command of some small\r\nvessels with which he did much damage to the enemy off the Norman coast.\r\nHe was taken prisoner in 1796 and kept in France for eighteen months. He\r\nescaped in 1798 with the help of a royalist officer of engineers,\r\nColonel Phelypeaux, was sent to Constantinople as joint-plenipotentiary\r\nwith his brother, and, Nelson being at Naples, became senior naval\r\nofficer in the Levant. Acre, as the best harbour on the Syrian coast,\r\nwas specially important to British maritime supremacy in those waters.\r\nSo long as it remained uncaptured, Bonaparte could not advance, for the\r\ndoor would be left open to an attack on his rear. If he took the place,\r\nhe believed that Syria would rise against Djezzar, its Turkish ruler.\r\nThe fortifications were weak, but Nelson's victory deprived him of the\r\npower of investing it by sea. Smith sent his friend, Phelypeaux, in the\r\n_Theseus_ (74) to teach the Turks how to strengthen the place, and\r\nfollowed himself in the _Tigre_ (74). On March 18 he intercepted a\r\nFrench flotilla with the artillery, ammunition, and stores on which\r\nBonaparte depended for the siege. They were brought into Acre; the\r\nFrench were left only with field-pieces, and it was not until April 25\r\nthat they could bring up heavy guns from Jaffa. Much fierce fighting\r\ntook place between the Turks and the French; and the British ships kept\r\nup a constant fire on the French in their lines and whenever they\r\nadvanced to attack. Smith, who was given to vapouring, was offended by\r\nsome communication from Bonaparte, and sent him a challenge to which\r\nBonaparte replied that he would fight when the English sent a\r\nMarlborough to meet him.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's victory over the Turks at Mount Tabor seemed a great step\r\ntowards conquest. All depended on the fate of Acre. At last on May 7 the\r\nTurkish fleet from Rhodes hove in sight. It was becalmed, and the French\r\nmade a desperate attempt to storm the place before the reinforcements\r\ncould arrive. They effected a lodgment, but Smith landed his seamen who\r\nhelped to drive them out with their pikes, and they fell back with heavy\r\nloss. On the 20th Bonaparte raised the siege which had cost him nearly\r\n5,000 men by war and sickness. Smith received the thanks of parliament\r\nand a pension of L1,000 a year. Though vainglorious and arrogant, he\r\nconducted the defence of Acre with sound judgment as well as with energy\r\nand courage. By weary marches through the desert, Bonaparte led his army\r\nback to Egypt, where he defeated an invasion of Turks. Smith sent him a\r\nbundle of newspapers, and from them he received tidings which determined\r\nhim to leave his army and return to France. Before we enter on the\r\nEuropean events which chiefly led to his return, let us see how the ruin\r\nof his plan of eastern conquest, the fruit of Nelson's victory, affected\r\nthe British rule in India.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the resources of Tipu in 1792 Cornwallis believed that he\r\nwas establishing a balance of power in India which would enable the\r\nEnglish to adopt a policy of nonintervention. This policy was pursued\r\nboth by him and his successor, Sir John Shore, afterwards Lord\r\nTeignmouth. It was defeated through the revival of French influence. The\r\nnizam put his army under French officers who held a large part of his\r\nterritories and paid their troops out of their revenues. Daulat Rao\r\nSindhia, the strongest of the Maratha lords, also employed French\r\nofficers and was inclined to help Tipu rather than the English. From\r\nneither of these powers, which were in alliance with the company in\r\nCornwallis's war with Tipu, could any help be expected in a fresh\r\nstruggle with him; and as in 1797 Tipu proposed an alliance with France\r\nagainst the English, a struggle could not be far off. In October of that\r\nyear Pitt's friend, Lord Mornington, was appointed governor-general. On\r\nthe day that he reached Madras, in April, 1798, Tipu received a French\r\nforce from Mauritius. Mornington at once persuaded the nizam to enter\r\ninto a subsidiary treaty by which he agreed to dismiss his French\r\nofficers and to form a close alliance with the company. The Frenchmen\r\nwere made prisoners and his army was placed under British officers.\r\nBonaparte's expedition to Egypt encouraged Tipu in his hostility, for he\r\nexpected that a French army would shortly appear in India. This hope was\r\nfrustrated by Nelson's victory. Nevertheless, he believed that the time\r\nwould come when he would be able to co-operate with a French invasion;\r\nhe tried to play a waiting game, and evaded the British attempts at\r\npacification. Mornington determined to put an end to his subterfuges,\r\nand, in February, 1799, ordered an invasion of Mysore under General\r\nHarris, the governor of Madras. Harris's army was joined by the army of\r\nthe nizam, and, on March 27, routed Tipu at Malvalli, the left wing of\r\nthe British, which consisted mainly of the nizam's contingent, being\r\nunder the command of Mornington's brother, Sir Arthur Wellesley,\r\nafterwards Duke of Wellington. Seringapatam was taken by storm and Tipu\r\nwas slain. Mornington, who was created Marquis Wellesley, partitioned\r\nMysore, set up a youthful raja, and placed him under British protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A NEW COALITION PROPOSED._]\r\n\r\nWhile Nelson's victory enabled Englishmen to uphold the power and\r\ninterests of their country in the east, it led also to a second\r\ncoalition against France. Already mistress of the Batavian, Cisalpine,\r\nand Ligurian republics, France occupied Rome in February, 1798, drove\r\nout Pius VI., and founded a Roman republic. In August, the Helvetic\r\nrepublic, established partly by intrigue and partly by force, in place\r\nof the Swiss confederation, became her dependent ally. The German empire\r\nwas hopelessly divided, Piedmont was in process of annexation, Naples\r\nwas threatened. Yet the power of France was not so great as it seemed.\r\nAmong the peoples of the new republics many resented the destruction of\r\ntheir old independent governments. Pitt poured money from the secret\r\nservice funds into the hands of agents, who in every country of Europe\r\nrecruited for the interest of England. He seems generally to have\r\nreceived a good return, except in Holland, where the democratic party\r\nremained strong. In other lands the rising feeling against France was of\r\nno small importance in the coming struggle.\r\n\r\nPaul, the Russian tsar, was deeply offended by the capture of Malta, for\r\nhe had a romantic predilection for the order of St. John, of which he\r\nconstituted himself the protector. The eastward advance of the French\r\nseemed to threaten the spread of republicanism to his dominions and the\r\nrevival of trouble in Poland. Encouraged by Nelson's victory, he incited\r\nthe Porte to declare war on France, sent ships to act with the British\r\nand Portuguese squadrons in the Mediterranean, and formed a defensive\r\nalliance with the Turks to which England acceded.[290] He tried in vain\r\nto induce the courts of Berlin and Vienna to combine against France, and\r\nappears to have made a secret treaty with Austria concerning the passage\r\nof troops, for some 60,000 Russians were soon marching towards the\r\nDanube.[291] Pitt eagerly took advantage of the tsar's disposition.\r\nGrenville promised a subsidy if the tsar would enter on the war as a\r\nprincipal,[292] and on November 16 bade Sir Charles Whitworth, the\r\nBritish ambassador at St. Petersburg, propose a coalition between\r\nEngland, Russia, Austria, and Prussia to support Naples, re-establish\r\nAustria in Italy, drive the French from Holland, the Belgian\r\nNetherlands, Switzerland, and Savoy, and join the Netherlands to Holland\r\nto form a strong barrier state.[293] Frederick William III., who\r\nsucceeded his father in 1797, would not be moved from his neutrality.\r\nRussia was only waiting for the arrangement of a subsidy. With Austria\r\nthere were difficulties. The emperor, disgusted with the greediness of\r\nFrance, was fully determined on war, but wanted a loan of L2,000,000. As\r\nEngland had lost by former transactions with Austria, Pitt would make no\r\nfurther promise until existing obligations had been fulfilled.[294]\r\nBesides, the imperial minister Thugut was anxious for delay; he hoped\r\nthat the directory would be crushed by its own difficulties, and in any\r\ncase was unwilling to move without the co-operation of Prussia, or\r\nbefore Russia could enter on the campaign. He had formed a defensive\r\nalliance between Austria and the Two Sicilies, or Naples, on May 19, but\r\ndeclared that Austria would only support Naples if France was the\r\naggressor, and would give no help if Naples began the war.[295]\r\n\r\nHis plans were disconcerted by the action of Ferdinand IV. of Naples.\r\nAfter the battle of the Nile the British fleet in the Mediterranean was\r\nbroken up and employed in different directions. Nelson himself sailed to\r\nNaples, was received as its deliverer, and was ensnared by the charms of\r\nEmma, the wife of Sir William Hamilton, the British minister. She was a\r\nwoman of low birth, and in her youth had entered on an immoral life.\r\nThough grown stout she was still beautiful, and her considerable natural\r\ntalents had been improved by Charles Greville, under whose protection\r\nshe had lived. He passed her over to Hamilton, who married her in 1791.\r\nQueen Maria Caroline made a favourite of her, and used her for political\r\nends, for the queen was anxious for British help against the French and\r\nthe Neapolitan republicans. Under court and female influences, Nelson,\r\nwho had been ordered to protect Naples, came to consider its fortunes as\r\nof the first importance. The queen, far bolder and more energetic than\r\nher husband, was bent on war. Mack, the Austrian strategist, took\r\ncommand of the army, and by Nelson's advice Ferdinand declared war on\r\nFrance. Nelson assisted the operations by carrying troops to Leghorn.\r\nFerdinand entered Rome in triumph on November 29. His triumph was\r\nshort-lived; the Neapolitans were routed by the French, and Naples was\r\nthreatened. On December 23 the king and queen and their court took\r\nrefuge on board Nelson's ship, the _Vanguard_, and her companions, and\r\nNelson conveyed them to Palermo and remained with them there. The French\r\noccupied Naples and the Parthenopean republic was established on the\r\nmainland of the Two Sicilies. Among other operations in the\r\nMediterranean a small British force took Minorca from the Spaniards in\r\nNovember without the loss of a man, and British and Portuguese ships\r\nblockaded Valetta and compelled the surrender of Gozo. In order to avoid\r\noffending the tsar, or exciting the jealousy of the Austrian or\r\nNeapolitan courts, England renounced all desire for conquest either as\r\nregards Malta, where she proposed that the knights should be\r\nre-established, or the Adriatic, where Turkish and Russian ships were\r\nattacking the French in the former possessions of Venice.[296]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SECOND COALITION._]\r\n\r\nThe ill-advised action of Ferdinand of Naples, for which Nelson was\r\nlargely responsible, caused some embarrassment to the English\r\ngovernment, and Grenville anxiously assured Thugut that England was not\r\nresponsible for it.[297] At the same time it hastened the formation of\r\nthe second coalition. A treaty of close alliance with Naples was signed\r\nby Russia on November 29, and another by the Porte on December 23, to\r\nwhich Great Britain acceded on January 2.[298] England further made a\r\ntreaty with Russia on December 29 by which the tsar agreed to furnish\r\n45,000 men to act against France in co-operation with Prussia, and\r\nEngland promised a subsidy of L225,000 for initial expenses and L75,000\r\na month afterwards. Thomas Grenville was sent to Berlin to act with\r\nCount Panin in persuading Frederick William to join the coalition. The\r\nking refused; the treaty with Russia was modified by a mutual agreement\r\nthat the Russian troops should be employed as seemed most advantageous\r\nto both powers, and the English government suggested that they should\r\nact with the Austrians in Switzerland.[299] Austria was soon forced to\r\nabandon her temporising policy. A corps of 25,000 Russians was encamped\r\non the Danube. France demanded their expulsion from Austrian territory,\r\nand that, as Thugut said, meant war.[300] On February 28 Jourdan crossed\r\nthe Rhine with 40,000 men. The second coalition of which England was the\r\nsoul was a direct result of the battle of the Nile.\r\n\r\nEngland was successful alike in arms and diplomacy. She had crushed a\r\nlong-threatened rebellion and had been unharmed by attempts at invasion.\r\nHer fleet had vindicated her naval supremacy in the Mediterranean;\r\nBonaparte's great design against her commerce and power in the east had\r\nutterly failed, and she had succeeded for the second time in forming a\r\ncoalition against the common enemy. Though she was burdened with\r\ntaxation and debt, and suffering from the evils of a prolonged war, her\r\ncommerce was increasing and sedition was virtually extinct. In one\r\nquarter only is an almost insignificant failure to be recorded. The\r\nattempt to conquer San Domingo with insufficient forces, in which the\r\ngovernment had persevered since 1793, was abandoned. Animated by\r\nrepublican sentiments, the negroes raised a large army under a former\r\nslave, Toussaint l'Ouverture. The small British force at Port-au-Prince\r\ncould make no head against them, and was withdrawn in 1798. France\r\nshortly afterwards withdrew her forces, and Toussaint remained virtually\r\nmaster of the island. England's failure entailed no real loss. She\r\nacknowledged the neutrality of San Domingo, and Toussaint opened its\r\nports to her commerce and prevented France from using them for\r\nprivateering purposes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[281] Desbriere, _Projets de Debarquement_, i., 387-90.\r\n\r\n[282] Gordon, _Hist. of the Rebellion_, pp. 166-67, 378-80; Lecky,\r\n_Hist._, viii., 103.\r\n\r\n[283] Gordon, _u.s._, p. 140.\r\n\r\n[284] Lecky, _Hist._, viii., 286.\r\n\r\n[285] Desbriere, _Projets de Debarquement_, ii., 40-42.\r\n\r\n[286] Desbriere, _Projets de Debarquement_, ii., 120-21.\r\n\r\n[287] Desbriere, _Projets de Debarquement_, ii., 182.\r\n\r\n[288] Mahan, _Influence of Sea Power on the French Revolution_, i.,\r\n257-71.\r\n\r\n[289] Rose, _Life of Napoleon_, i., 201.\r\n\r\n[290] Grenville to Whitworth, Oct. 3 and 5, 1798, MS.

In Germany Jourdan was defeated by\r\nthe Archduke Charles in the country between the Lake of Constance and\r\nthe Danube, and the French withdrew across the Rhine. In Italy they were\r\nrepulsed by the Austrians, retreated across the Mincio and, on April 12,\r\nfell back behind the Adda. Then a Russian army joined the Austrians, and\r\nSuvorov, the captor of Ismail, took command of the allied forces. He\r\nconquered Lombardy at the battle of Cassano on the 27th-29th. Moreau\r\nretreated behind the Ticino, and called on Macdonald to bring his army\r\nfrom Naples to help him. Suvorov's blows fell in quick succession; he\r\nadvanced into Piedmont, cut Moreau off from communication with Massena,\r\nwho was operating in Switzerland, and invited Charles Emanuel, who had\r\nbeen forced to abdicate his continental possessions, to return to Turin.\r\nEverywhere the Italian people rose against the French. Suvorov designed\r\nto crush Moreau and Macdonald separately, to cross the Alps, and restore\r\nthe French monarchy. He was thwarted by the Austrian court. Thugut\r\ndisapproved of the proposed restoration of the King of Sardinia, for he\r\nwas set on the aggrandisement of Austria at the expense of Piedmont. The\r\ntsar aimed at the re-establishment of the old order in Europe, the\r\nemperor at the increase of his own dominions. Suvorov, though indignant\r\nat Austrian opposition, turned to the work immediately before him, and\r\ninflicted a crushing defeat on Macdonald at the Trebbia on June 19.\r\nMacdonald made a rapid retreat, and finally led his shattered army to\r\nGenoa. A new French army was defeated by Suvorov at Novi on August 15,\r\nits commander, Joubert, falling early in the battle.\r\n\r\nThe English government approved of the emperor's designs on Piedmont,\r\nfor under a strong power the country would be a barrier to French\r\naggression,[301] and as the difference of policy between Austria and\r\nRussia hindered the progress of the war, devised a plan for bringing\r\nthem into accord as regards operations. Suvorov, after completing the\r\nconquest of Italy, was to enter Switzerland and prosecute his intended\r\ninvasion of France; the Austrians were to remain in occupation of\r\nPiedmont and enter France by Savoy, while the archduke was to act on the\r\nRhine where his presence would forward a scheme for an invasion of\r\nHolland by England and Russia. During the spring and summer the archduke\r\nhad been struggling with Massena in Switzerland without making much\r\nprogress, though in August the French evacuated the Grisons country.\r\nShortly before he left for the upper Rhine he was joined by a new\r\nRussian army under Korsakov. After his departure Massena utterly\r\ndefeated Korsakov and his Austrian allies near Zurich on September 26.\r\nWhen, then, Suvorov had, in spite of great hardships, led his army over\r\nthe St. Gothard, he found his whole plan of campaign overset and his\r\nposition seriously endangered by Korsakov's defeat. He abandoned the\r\ncampaign, and at the head of only 25,000 men of the 70,000 sent by the\r\ntsar to the war, retired into Germany. In the Mediterranean, Corfu, the\r\nother Venetian islands, and several important posts were captured by the\r\ncombined Russian and Turkish squadrons. Valetta was closely besieged\r\nunder Nelson's direction; Italy was virtually lost to the French, though\r\nthey still held Genoa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NELSON AT NAPLES._]\r\n\r\nEngland bore a part in the war both by sea and land. On April 25 a\r\npowerful French fleet slipped out from Brest. All the southern coast of\r\nEngland was disturbed by the fear of invasion. The French, however,\r\nsailed into the Mediterranean. The fleet under St. Vincent was scattered\r\non different services and each division was far weaker than the French,\r\nwho were expected at Naples, at Malta, and at Alexandria. A crisis was\r\nimpending at Naples. The upper and middle classes were largely\r\nrepublican, the poor throughout the kingdom were attached to the\r\nmonarchy. In February, Cardinal Ruffo, as the king's vicar-general, set\r\non foot a counter-revolution. At the head of a horde of peasants he\r\nquickly regained Calabria for the king, while a Neapolitan diplomatist,\r\nMicheroux, with the help of some Russian and Turkish ships, won back\r\nApulia. On April 3 Troubridge captured Procida and Ischia from the\r\nrepublicans, but on the arrival of the French fleet in the\r\nMediterranean, was summoned by Nelson to join him at Maritimo, and left\r\nonly one British ship off Naples under Captain Foote. On June 13, after\r\nMacdonald had withdrawn his army, the bands of Ruffo and Micheroux\r\nentered Naples and took cruel vengeance on the republicans. The castle\r\nof St. Elmo, held by a French garrison, and the castles Dell' Uovo and\r\nNuovo by Neapolitan republicans, were besieged by the royalists, by\r\nFoote, and by the Russian and Turkish allies. Both sides expected the\r\narrival of the French fleet, and Ruffo was anxious to gain speedy\r\npossession of the forts. An armistice was arranged, and on the 19th a\r\ncapitulation of the forts Dell' Uovo and Nuovo was agreed upon, was\r\nsigned by Ruffo, Foote, and the Russian and Turkish commanders, and was\r\nratified by the French commandant of St. Elmo.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation provided that the rebels should surrender the two forts\r\nand evacuate them unharmed as soon as transports should be ready to\r\nconvey to Toulon such of them as desired to depart. On the 21st Nelson,\r\nafter an interview with the king, sailed from Palermo for Naples. As\r\nsoon as he arrived, on the 24th, he signalled to annul the armistice,\r\nand sent word to Ruffo that he disallowed the capitulation. The next day\r\nhe sent Ruffo a declaration that he should not allow the rebels to\r\nembark; they must surrender to the king's mercy, and he bade Ruffo\r\ninform them of his decision. Ruffo refused, and remonstrated in person\r\nwith Nelson, who gave him a written \"opinion\" that the capitulation\r\ncould not be carried out without the king's approbation. The cardinal\r\nthen sent the rebels Nelson's declaration. On the 26th Nelson promised\r\nhim that he would not break the armistice and, further, sent him word\r\nthat he would not oppose the embarkation of the rebels. Did not Ruffo,\r\nanxious for British help in case the French and the rebels should renew\r\nhostilities, yield to Nelson's opinion that the question of the\r\ncapitulation should be reserved for the king? We have no absolute proof\r\nthat this was so, but Sir John Acton, Ferdinand's minister, in a letter\r\nof August 1, says that the king pardoned Ruffo because he yielded to\r\nNelson's wise declarations.[302] After receiving a communication from\r\nRuffo, Micheroux informed the rebels, no doubt in good faith, that\r\nNelson had consented to the capitulation. The evacuation was arranged,\r\nand the rebels embarked that evening in the belief that they would be\r\nallowed to proceed to Toulon. Nelson prevented the transports from\r\nleaving the harbour. The king disallowed the capitulation, and put to\r\ndeath a large number of the rebels.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main outlines of this extremely complicated affair. It is\r\ncertain that Ruffo exceeded his authority in arranging the capitulation,\r\nand that Nelson knew and carried out the king's wishes. He evidently\r\nacted with full authority; he neither changed his opinion as regards the\r\ncapitulation nor did he deceive either Ruffo or the rebels. That the\r\nrebels were deceived is certain, but for that Ruffo was responsible,\r\nthough he may only have been guilty of gross carelessness in not making\r\nMicheroux understand the position of affairs. But Nelson's conduct was\r\nnot creditable. The capitulation was not less valid because Ruffo acted\r\ndisobediently in arranging it, and it was signed by a British captain.\r\nNelson was justified in suspending its execution until King Ferdinand's\r\nwill was declared; but, as the rebels could not then be restored to the\r\nposition they held before it was made, he was bound to use every effort\r\nto induce the king not to break it, and to allow the rebels to proceed\r\nto Toulon. Unfortunately he had imbibed the vengeful spirit of the\r\nNeapolitan court. Blinded by the blandishments of his mistress and the\r\nflattery of the court, he forgot the conduct which became a British\r\nadmiral and the representative of his own sovereign, and pandered to the\r\ncruel desires of the Bourbon king and queen for vengeance on those who\r\nhad revolted against their detestable government.[303]\r\n\r\nWith the fate of one Neapolitan rebel Nelson was immediately concerned.\r\nFrancesco Caracciolo, formerly commander of the royal fleet, had joined\r\nthe republicans, taken command of their vessels, and fired on his king's\r\nfrigate, the _Minerva_. He escaped from Naples on June 17, and so was\r\nnot included in the capitulation; he was arrested, and on Nelson's\r\nrepeated request was handed over to him by Ruffo on the 29th. Nelson\r\nimmediately ordered the captain of the _Minerva_ and other royal\r\nofficers to try him by court-martial on board his own flagship, the\r\n_Foudroyant_. Caracciolo was found guilty of treason, and sentenced to\r\ndeath with ignominy. Nelson ordered that he should be hanged that same\r\nevening from the yard-arm of the _Minerva_, which was accordingly done.\r\nHe was forty-seven at the time of his death. His treason was patent, and\r\nits penalty inevitable. Although Nelson does not appear to have received\r\nany written commission from Ferdinand, he evidently had a right to order\r\nthe court-martial and to enforce its sentence,[304] but the eagerness\r\nwith which he acted and the indecent haste of the execution are\r\nlamentable illustrations of his animosity. The garrison of St. Elmo\r\nsurrendered on terms, and the royal power was re-established in Naples.\r\nThe French fleet was still in the Mediterranean. Large as it was, it did\r\nnothing of importance, save effecting a junction with the fleet of\r\nSpain. The combined fleets reached Brest in September, outstripping the\r\npursuit of the British under Lord Keith, who succeeded St. Vincent as\r\ncommander-in-chief. In April, 1800, St. Vincent took command of the\r\nchannel fleet and instituted a strict blockade of Brest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXPEDITION TO THE HELDER._]\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1799, Pitt made a convention with Russia for a joint\r\ninvasion of Holland. On the part of England the principal object was the\r\ncapture of the Dutch fleet in the Texel and the destruction of the naval\r\ndepot, which would deprive France of maritime aid from Holland, while\r\nboth the allied powers hoped to follow up the Austrian successes by\r\nthreatening the French frontier. It was expected that the Orange party\r\nwould be strong enough to give the invaders effectual help and that the\r\nDutch would rise against the French. The tsar promised 17,500 men, and\r\nEngland agreed to send 13,000, to pay the tsar L88,000 for first\r\nexpenses, and a subsidy of L44,000 a month, and to provide transports\r\nand horses. On August 27 a British force of 10,000 men under Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby landed at the Helder, a point by no means suited for an\r\ninvasion, which was chosen on account of its proximity to the Dutch\r\nfleet. Abercromby repulsed an attack of the Dutch and threw open the\r\nTexel to the British ships, under Admiral Mitchell. The Dutch seamen,\r\nwho were attached to the house of Orange, forced their officers to hoist\r\nthe prince's flag, and the fleet, consisting of thirteen ships carrying\r\nfrom sixty-four to forty-four guns and other smaller vessels,\r\nsurrendered, and was carried to Yarmouth. The arrival of the Russians\r\nwas delayed, and the republicans had time to make preparations for\r\ndefence. Brune, a French general, took command of the combined French\r\nand Dutch forces, and failing in an attempt on the British position,\r\nestablished his quarters before Alkmaar.\r\n\r\nOn September 12 the first division of the Russians arrived, and\r\nreinforcements from England brought up the number of the combined army\r\nto about 30,000 men. The Duke of York was ostensibly in command, but the\r\ncabinet ordered that all operations should be directed by a standing\r\ncouncil of war. A general advance was attempted on the 18th-19th. It was\r\nnot well planned, and failed owing chiefly to the undisciplined\r\nimpetuosity of the Russians on the right wing. The British lost over\r\n1,000 killed and wounded, the Russians about 2,500, but the allies took\r\nsome 3,000 prisoners, mostly Dutch. Heavy rains set in; the republicans\r\nbroke up the roads and laid the country in front of the allies under\r\nwater. The invaders, cooped up in a sandy corner of land, were in a\r\nsorry plight. A fresh advance was attempted on October 2; there was some\r\nheavy fighting in which General, afterwards Sir John, Moore and his\r\nbrigade highly distinguished themselves, and Moore was twice wounded. It\r\nwas a drawn battle; and Brune fell back on the formidable line of\r\nBeverwyk. The duke attacked him on the 6th, and failed to drive him from\r\nhis position. It became evident that the allies would not succeed in\r\nforcing their way out of the small district they occupied, and that the\r\nhopes entertained in England of assistance from the Dutch were\r\nfallacious, for the people showed no sign of deserting the French\r\nalliance. Accordingly, on the 18th, the duke capitulated; it was agreed\r\nthat the allies should re-embark unmolested and that England should\r\nrestore 8,000 French and Dutch prisoners. The British troops returned\r\nhome and the Russians were assigned winter-quarters in the Channel\r\nislands. Dearly as this ill-planned expedition cost England, both in men\r\nand money, the country was consoled for its failure by the acquisition\r\nof the Dutch fleet, which passed into the king's service in virtue of a\r\nconvention with the Prince of Orange. About the same time came news of\r\nthe surrender of the rich Dutch colony of Surinam to Admiral Lord Hugh\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PAUL DESERTS THE COALITION._]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the coalition was broken up by the defection of\r\nRussia. Paul was angered by the policy of Austria which, under Thugut's\r\ndirection, was dictated by anxiety for the acquisition of Piedmont; he\r\nwas irritated by the support Thugut received from the English government\r\nwhich, so far as the continental war was concerned, based its hopes on\r\nAustrian success, and he was disgusted by the failure of his arms. He\r\nconsidered that his troops were sacrificed in Switzerland to Austrian\r\nselfishness, that they were not well treated in the expedition to the\r\nHelder, and, which seems to some extent true, that they were shabbily\r\nprovided for in the Channel islands.[305] He recalled his troops and\r\nwithdrew from the coalition. His political attitude exhibited \"daily\r\ntergiversation,\" the result of palace intrigues.[306] The hope of\r\ngaining Malta for himself and the knights still allured him, and on\r\nDecember 31, he assumed the grandmastership of the order. He kept his\r\nfleet in the Mediterranean to assist in the blockade of Valetta, in the\r\nhope of making other acquisitions, and to support the King of Naples.\r\nYet his unsettled mind sometimes veered towards France; the \"virtues of\r\nBonaparte\" would suddenly become his chief topic of conversation and\r\n\"everything would be in suspense\" as regards his policy.[307] Bonaparte\r\nhad returned to France, and his return was to decide the issue of the\r\nwar on the continent, though that result could not be foreseen\r\nimmediately. From the newspapers sent him by Sidney Smith he learnt in\r\nEgypt the news of the early successes of the Austrians and the\r\ndistracted state of France. The government was unpopular, the taxes\r\nwere heavy, the revenues fell short of the expenditure, commerce was\r\ndestroyed, the royalists were in arms in the north-west, and brigandage\r\nwas rife. He left his army in the charge of Kleber, embarked on August\r\n23, evaded the British cruisers, and landed at Frejus on October 9. He\r\njoined a party which was plotting against the directory. On November 9\r\nand 10 (18th and 19th Brumaire) he overthrew not only the directory,\r\nwhich was ready to fall, but the legislature also. A provisional\r\ngovernment was set up, and on December 13 a new constitution was\r\npublished. Bonaparte was declared first consul for ten years with powers\r\nwhich, under a thin disguise, made him virtually master of France.\r\n\r\nKleber found his resources failing, no help came to him, for England was\r\nsupreme in the Mediterranean, and the Turks threatened to attack him.\r\nWith the assistance of Sidney Smith, who acted on his own\r\nresponsibility, he arranged a capitulation with the grand-vizier. The\r\nconvention of El Arish, signed on January 24, 1800, provided that the\r\nFrench should evacuate Egypt and return home unmolested, and it\r\ncontained no stipulation that they should not serve again during the\r\nwar. The English ministers, aware that Kleber was in straits, had\r\nalready ordered Keith not to agree to any terms short of the surrender\r\nof the French troops as prisoners of war. Keith informed Smith of this\r\norder, but his letter did not reach him until after the convention was\r\nsigned. On receiving it, Smith sent word to Kleber that his government\r\nrefused to sanction the convention. When the ministers heard that Smith\r\nhad assented to it, they generously resolved not to disavow the act of a\r\nBritish officer, and ordered that the convention should be recognised.\r\nBy that time, however, the French had defeated the Turks at Heliopolis\r\nand were determined to make further efforts to hold the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BONAPARTE'S LETTER._]\r\n\r\nBonaparte lost no time in setting about the pacification of civil strife\r\nin France. In December, 1799, Pitt, untaught by experience, was planning\r\nan expedition to co-operate with the royalists in La Vendee and\r\nBrittany, with the object of reducing Brest, compelling the surrender of\r\nthe French fleet, which was to be held in the name of Louis XVIII. (the\r\nCount of Provence), and taking the Spanish fleet as prize. Bonaparte's\r\nskilful policy pacified the disturbed districts, and foiled the hopes of\r\nthe royalist conspirators. Pitt was forced to postpone his scheme and\r\nafter a time abandoned it. While he was engaged on it, Bonaparte sent a\r\nletter addressed to the king personally, in which he declared his desire\r\nfor peace. In later days he said that his object was merely to increase\r\nhis popularity; for the French were weary of war. In this case he\r\nprobably spoke the truth. Be this as it may, he certainly would not have\r\nagreed to such terms as would have given to England and to Europe the\r\nsecurity for which England was fighting. His letter was answered by\r\nGrenville, who said that the king could not enter into negotiations\r\nunless he had a satisfactory assurance that France would abandon the\r\nsystem of aggression, that while he did not prescribe the form of\r\ngovernment she should adopt, no assurance would be so satisfactory as\r\nthe restoration of the monarchy, and that her present government\r\nafforded no evidence either of a change of system or of stability.\r\nGeorge thought this letter \"much too strong,\" but suggested no\r\nalteration. Talleyrand, then French minister of foreign affairs, wrote\r\nin favour of a negotiation between the two powers, and was told by\r\nGrenville that if the king could see the security of his own dominions\r\nand of Europe assured, he would gladly negotiate \"in concert with his\r\nallies\". The position taken by the ministers was sound and honourable,\r\nbut the tone of their answer to Bonaparte was unwise, for it played his\r\ngame by uniting the French in a determination to resist foreign\r\ndictation with respect to their domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nAn address to the crown on the French overtures was moved in the lords\r\nby Grenville, and was carried by 92 votes to 6. In the commons it was\r\nsupported by George Canning, already one of the ablest speakers on the\r\ngovernment side, and by Pitt who, in one of his finest speeches,\r\nreviewed the relations of France with other states from 1792 onwards, as\r\nproving that the proposed negotiations would have been illusory; he\r\nurged that the exhausted state of France held out hope of a permanent\r\npeace, and declared that as a lover of peace he would not sacrifice it\r\nby grasping at a shadow. The address was opposed by Fox, who returned to\r\nparliament for the occasion. He effectively ridiculed Pitt's\r\noft-repeated assurances that France was exhausted; but his main\r\ncontention, that if France as a republic had been aggressive, so she had\r\nbeen when under Louis XIV., that she had not acted worse than the allies\r\nof Great Britain, and that there was therefore no reason to refuse to\r\nnegotiate with her, seems academic and feeble. The opposition mustered\r\nin full strength, but was defeated by 265 to 64. The divisions prove\r\nthat the position of the government was unimpaired in parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the country generally the patriotic spirit aroused by the military\r\naggressions of France and the achievements of the British navy was\r\nstrong, and revolutionary principles were seldom publicly professed.\r\nSome abortive projects of Irish conspirators in 1798 for co-operating\r\nwith the corresponding society led to the appointment of a committee of\r\nthe commons, which reported on the revolutionary societies in March,\r\n1799. Bills were passed for suppressing these societies and restricting\r\ndebating societies, and for compelling printers to obtain certificates\r\nand to affix their names to all matter that they printed. In evident\r\nconnexion with these measures was the law against combinations of\r\nworkmen enacted in this, and amended in the next session, to which\r\nreference has already been made (p. 277); though probably political in\r\nintention, it had an oppressive effect on the condition of the working\r\nclasses. Only three trials for sedition took place during the year, one\r\nof them of the printer and publisher, and another of the author of the\r\nsame libel, a pamphlet by Gilbert Wakefield in answer to one on the\r\ngovernment side. Wakefield, who had taken deacon's orders and afterwards\r\nleft the Church, was a distinguished scholar and a friend of Fox. He was\r\nprosecuted by Scott, the attorney-general, and sentenced to two years'\r\nimprisonment, and to find sureties for his future behaviour. The\r\nseverity of the sentence excited the indignation of the opposition, and\r\nL5,000 was subscribed for him. In July Scott was appointed chief-justice\r\nof the common pleas, and received a peerage as Lord Eldon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INCOME TAX._]\r\n\r\nThe burdens of the country were increasing. In December, 1798, Pitt\r\nannounced that the supplies exceeded the ordinary revenue by\r\nL23,000,000. He repeated the principle which he enunciated when\r\nproposing the triple assessment, that loans should not exceed such\r\namount as could be defrayed within a limited time by temporary taxation.\r\nThe triple assessment had failed, though the deficiency had been\r\nsupplied by voluntary contributions. He proposed to substitute an income\r\ntax of 2s. in the pound on all incomes of and above L200, and of\r\ngraduated amounts between L60 and L200. The produce, he calculated,\r\nwould be at least L10,000,000 a year. The opposition, led by Tierney,\r\nobjected to the tax as inquisitorial, as a grievous confiscation, and as\r\nunjust, in that it would fall equally on precarious and on settled\r\nincomes, on the produce of industry and on the wealth of the idle. It\r\nwas carried in the lords without a division, and in the commons by a\r\nlarge majority, and came into operation on April 5, 1799. During the\r\nyear 1799 Pitt raised L15,000,000 by loan, including L3,000,000 for\r\nIreland, charging the income tax with the interest and redemption of\r\nL11,000,000. The loan was raised in the 3 per cents; it created L175\r\ndebt for each L100 money, and the rate was therefore 5-1/4 per cent. In\r\nhis next budget, for 1800, Pitt reported the supplies for the year at\r\nL39,500,000. The produce of the income tax for the first year was\r\ndisappointing, and for the coming year he reckoned it only at\r\nL7,000,000. In return for a renewal of its charter the bank of England\r\ngranted a loan of L3,000,000, without interest, for six years, and Pitt\r\nfurther borrowed L20,500,000, including L2,000,000 for Ireland. The\r\nincome tax was charged with L13,500,000 of the British loan, and\r\nadditions were made to the taxes on tea and spirits. Public credit was\r\ngood and commerce and manufactures rapidly increasing, and Pitt obtained\r\nthe loan at an average rate of not quite 4-3/4 per cent.\r\n\r\nBut while commerce was flourishing the poor were suffering terribly from\r\nscarcity. The spring and summer of 1799 were cold and wet, and the\r\nharvest was wretched. During the twelve months which succeeded September\r\n1, 1799, the average price of wheat rose to 106s. a quarter. Parliament\r\nheld several debates on the scarcity. Whitbread for the second time\r\nbrought in a bill for the regulation of the wages of agricultural\r\nlabourers; Pitt opposed it on sound economic grounds and it was again\r\nrejected. During the spring of 1800 parliament made some proposals for\r\nthe husbanding of wheat and for bounties on importation, but, as we\r\nshall see later, the scarcity grew more grievous. The distress of the\r\npoor and the burden of taxation strengthened the desire for peace, and a\r\nlarge meeting of London citizens petitioned parliament for negotiations\r\nwith France. In May the king was shot at in Drury Lane theatre. The\r\nincident had no political significance; his assailant, Hadfield, a\r\ndischarged soldier, was insane and was sent to Bedlam.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1800 Pitt's hopes were mainly founded on his scheme\r\nof co-operation with the French royalists, which was rendered abortive\r\nby Bonaparte's measures of pacification, and on the arms of Austria.\r\nThugut knew that from Bonaparte the emperor could not expect to gain\r\nbetter terms than those of the treaty of Campo Formio, and held that the\r\nbest chance of forwarding Austrian interests lay in prosecuting the war\r\nin alliance with England. Austria, however, could not move without\r\nEnglish money. The English government promised a loan of L2,000,000 and\r\nmade subsidiary treaties with the Elector of Bavaria, the Duke of\r\nWurtemberg, and the Elector of Mainz for contingents to serve with the\r\nAustrian armies. In April the Austrians under Melas defeated the French\r\nin the mountain passes to the west of Genoa, shut up the left wing of\r\ntheir army within the lines of Genoa, and forced the right wing under\r\nSuchet across the Var. Their advance was stayed by Massena's defence of\r\nGenoa. His troops suffered terribly from famine; they were shut in on\r\nland by the Austrians and bombarded from the sea by British ships.\r\nMeanwhile Bonaparte was preparing to attack the Austrians in northern\r\nItaly as soon as their chief army in the Black Forest country under Kray\r\nwas effectually held in check by the French army of the Rhine, so as to\r\nenable the French to use the Swiss passes. If Massena could detain the\r\nAustrians before Genoa until Bonaparte descended into Italy, they might\r\nthen be taken in the rear. A promise had been made that a British force\r\nwould co-operate with the Austrians and excite the royalists of southern\r\nFrance to insurrection. If such a force had landed on the rear of the\r\nFrench, Suchet's corps must have been destroyed, Genoa would probably\r\nhave fallen, and the campaign might have had a different event. But the\r\nministers failed to see the supreme importance of supporting the\r\nAustrians. They hesitated, and withdrew troops which should have been\r\nsent to Minorca to form an army to co-operate with Melas, in order to\r\nemploy them in Portugal. There, however, they were not wanted, for\r\nPortugal was not attacked. The great opportunity was lost. Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby with 5,000 men sailed from Minorca for Genoa on June 22, but\r\nthen it was too late.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BATTLE OF MARENGO._]\r\n\r\nIn April Moreau defeated Kray in a series of engagements and forced him\r\nto retire to Ulm. Bonaparte, who had formed \"an army of reserve\" at\r\nDijon, crossed the Great St. Bernard in May with 41,000 men, reached\r\nAosta on the 22nd, and entered Milan on June 2. On the 4th Massena\r\ncapitulated, and led his half-starved force out of Genoa with the\r\nhonours of war. It had done its work by keeping the Austrians before the\r\ncity. The successes of Moreau secured Switzerland and enabled Bonaparte\r\nto summon other French divisions, partly composed of detachments from\r\nMoreau's army, to enter Italy by the passes of the Simplon and the St.\r\nGothard. Their appearance upset the plans which Melas was making for\r\ndefence. He met Bonaparte at Marengo on the 14th, and after a\r\nhard-fought battle was totally defeated. On the 16th he signed a\r\nconvention at Alessandria, which left the French masters of the country\r\nas far as the Oglio. Hostilities in Germany were suspended on July 9.\r\nBonaparte returned to Paris in triumph after an absence of less than two\r\nmonths. On June 20, before the news of Marengo reached Vienna, Minto\r\nsigned a convention with Austria which guaranteed the loan to the\r\nemperor, and stipulated that neither power should make peace without the\r\nconsent of the other. Pitt's hopes were defeated; for the time Austria\r\nwas completely paralysed. The opposition reproached the government with\r\nthe failure of its plans. The country, it was urged, desired peace;\r\nanother defeat would reduce Austria to impotence, and France, disengaged\r\nfrom all continental war, would direct her whole strength against\r\nEngland. Parliament remained steadfast in its support of the government.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, anxious to detach Austria from her alliance with England,\r\noffered peace to the emperor, who sent an envoy to Paris to find out\r\nwhat terms he proposed. It was a dangerous move, for the English\r\nministers might have interpreted the mission as a negotiation for a\r\nseparate peace, contrary to the convention of June 20; and Thugut feared\r\nthat England might take offence and leave Austria to Bonaparte's mercy.\r\nThe emperor's envoy was in fact persuaded by Talleyrand to sign articles\r\nof peace, generally on the basis of the treaty of Campo Formio. The\r\nemperor disavowed his unauthorised action. Austria's interests would be\r\nbest served by a general peace, arranged at a European congress, at\r\nwhich Great Britain should be represented. This was in accordance with\r\nthe views of the British government, and on August 9 Minto informed the\r\nemperor that his court desired to take part in negotiations for a\r\ngeneral peace. The emperor proposed a congress at Luneville in which\r\nEngland should be invited to take part. Bonaparte's design of disuniting\r\nAustria from England and treating separately with the emperor was\r\nfoiled; he could not reject the emperor's proposal, for France was eager\r\nfor peace. Pitt and Grenville believed that negotiations were certain,\r\nand Thomas Grenville was chosen to attend the congress.\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte's diplomatic resources were not exhausted. He declared\r\nthat if the continental armistice with Austria was to be prolonged, it\r\nmust be supplemented by a naval armistice with Great Britain, and in\r\nSeptember he employed an agent named Otto to negotiate this armistice\r\nand to propose a separate peace between France and England. Bonaparte's\r\nproject would have enabled France to revictual Malta and to send\r\nsupplies and reinforcements to her army in Egypt, and would thus have\r\nrobbed England of the most powerful means of enforcing her demands in\r\nthe proposed congress. The king was for rejecting the project\r\nabsolutely. The cabinet was divided: Dundas and some others were for\r\nmaking a separate peace; Pitt and Grenville were determined to maintain\r\nthe alliance with Austria, to insist that all negotiations should be for\r\na general peace, and to refuse to throw away the advantages which\r\nEngland derived from her naval supremacy, but, as a speedy termination\r\nof the armistice would have been fatal to Austria, they hoped to modify\r\nBonaparte's demands. Pitt, of course, had his way, and the government,\r\nafter sending Bonaparte a counter-project which he refused, finally\r\nrejected his proposal. Bonaparte was enraged and stormed against\r\nEngland's usurpation of the lordship of the sea. Determined to isolate\r\nher, he pressed the emperor's ministers to negotiate separately. They\r\nforesaw that they might be forced to yield, but so long as they were not\r\nassured of advantageous terms, decided to remain united to England; for\r\nthey were unwilling to stand alone, to lose the money of England, or to\r\nrisk a possible alliance between England and Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AUSTRIAN POWER CRUSHED._]\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed naval armistice was still in debate, the blockade of\r\nValetta came to an end. England's supremacy in the Mediterranean\r\nprevented France from relieving the garrison. The only two ships which\r\nremained to France of the fleet defeated in Abukir bay were captured,\r\none of them by Nelson himself. The blockade was kept up until September\r\n15, when the place was surrendered after a siege of two years, and Malta\r\npassed into the possession of Great Britain. About the same time the\r\nDutch island of Curacao put itself under the king's protection. Earlier\r\nin the year Goree was surrendered to a British squadron. Elsewhere\r\nBritish ships were less profitably employed. Some attacks on the Breton\r\ncoast did little damage to the enemy, and brought no material advantage\r\nto England. The government employed the troops which should have been\r\nsent in the spring to the support of the Austrians in desultory\r\nexpeditions. In August a considerable force under Sir James Pulteney was\r\nsent against Ferrol. After landing his men Pulteney found that the place\r\nwas too strong to be taken by a _coup-de-main_, and abandoned the\r\nenterprise. An equally abortive attempt was made on Cadiz in October by\r\na force of 22,000 men under Abercromby, then commanding at Minorca, and\r\nby the Mediterranean fleet under Keith. The plague was raging in the\r\ntown, and Keith could not guarantee that, if the troops were landed, the\r\nweather might not cut them off from communication with the fleet, and\r\npossibly hinder re-embarkation. Abercromby therefore refused to land his\r\ntroops, and decided to sail off to Gibraltar. He received orders to\r\nattack the French in Egypt in co-operation with the grand-vizier. The\r\ntroops landed in Abukir bay on February 8 and 9, 1801, with results\r\nwhich must be deferred to our next volume.\r\n\r\nThe armistice in Germany ended on November 28. A strong Austrian army\r\nunder the archduke John, a general of no experience, held the line of\r\nthe Inn. The archduke adopted the offensive, crossed the river, attacked\r\nthe French under Moreau at Hohenlinden on December 3, and was totally\r\ndefeated, losing ninety-seven guns and 15,000 men, or more, killed,\r\nwounded, or prisoners. The Austrians were utterly crushed; the French\r\ncrossed the Inn and the Salzach without meeting serious opposition. The\r\narchduke Charles again took command of the defeated army, and on the\r\n25th signed an armistice at Steyer. Meanwhile Cobenzl, the imperial\r\nambassador, was haggling over terms of peace with Joseph Bonaparte at\r\nLuneville; he refused to negotiate officially without the participation\r\nof England, and at last proposed that if a treaty was made, it should\r\nnot be announced until after March 10 when the Anglo-Austrian alliance\r\nwould lapse. The battle of Hohenlinden brought the alliance to a\r\npremature end. The emperor informed the British court that he was no\r\nlonger able to maintain the alliance, and gave Cobenzl authority to sign\r\npreliminaries independently of Great Britain. The splendid achievement\r\nof Macdonald, who led the \"second army of reserve\" from the Grisons\r\nacross the Splugen, and the subsequent success of the French under\r\nBrune, who forced the passage of the Mincio and crossed the Adige,\r\nenabled Bonaparte to dictate his own terms to Austria. By the treaty of\r\nLuneville, signed on February 9, 1801, Belgium and the left bank of the\r\nRhine were ceded to France, and the line of the Adige was made the\r\nAustrian boundary in Italy; the grand-duchy of Tuscany was to be\r\ntransferred to the house of Parma, and Modena annexed to the Cisalpine\r\nrepublic, and the independence of the Batavian, Helvetian, Cisalpine,\r\nand Ligurian republics was acknowledged by Austria; they remained\r\npractically under French domination.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the loss of her ally, new dangers threatened England in\r\nthe later part of the year. They arose from the animosity of the tsar.\r\nHe was angered by England's alliance with Austria, and by the certainty\r\nthat his hostile attitude would prevent her from handing over Malta to\r\nhim; for though the government would have ceded the island to him as\r\ngrand-master of the knights, if he had continued to co-operate with\r\nEngland, it was not bound to do so by treaty, and would not cede it to a\r\nsovereign who was fast becoming an open enemy. Paul was greatly enraged,\r\nand on February 1, 1800, wrote to Vorontsov, his minister in England,\r\ndesiring that Whitworth (created Lord Whitworth in March) should be\r\nrecalled, as he did not want \"liars as ministers at his court\".[308] He\r\nrefused a passport to Whitworth's messenger in March, and behaved,\r\nWhitworth wrote, in the way which showed that he was \"literally not in\r\nhis senses\".[309] At last, apparently on April 1, he demanded\r\nWhitworth's recall.[310] After long delay Whitworth obtained a passport\r\nand returned to England, leaving the embassy to a _charge d'affaires_,\r\nwho was peremptorily dismissed by Paul, and left Russia with the embassy\r\nin June. Bonaparte was quick to take advantage of Paul's anger against\r\nEngland. After some overtures to him, begun as early as March,[311] he\r\nproposed in July to restore to him 6,000, and, later, a larger number of\r\nRussian prisoners taken in Holland and Switzerland, and suggested ceding\r\nto him Malta, which was then hard pressed by the British fleet. Paul was\r\ndelighted, and made arrangements for garrisoning Valetta; but the place\r\nwas surrendered to Great Britain, and the British government would not\r\npart with it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ARMED NEUTRALITY._]\r\n\r\nPaul had already laid his hand on the weapon forged by his mother\r\nCatherine in 1780, an armed neutrality of the Baltic powers. The war put\r\nmany difficulties in the way of neutral commerce. England's maritime\r\nsupremacy gave the trade of Europe into her hands. For her own purposes\r\nshe encouraged neutral trade with herself to the great profit of those\r\nwho engaged in it, but she placed rigorous restrictions on the trade of\r\nneutrals with her enemy. France, in a more lawless fashion, had\r\nattempted to destroy neutral trade with England, but had only succeeded\r\nin driving the ships of neutral states from her own ports.[312] England\r\ncould enforce her system in every sea. She refused to allow that an\r\nenemy's goods were covered by a neutral flag, and insisted that naval\r\nstores were contraband of war, and that no trade should be carried on\r\nwith a port of which she declared a blockade. In 1798 Sweden and Denmark\r\nadopted the plan of sending their merchant ships under convoy to exempt\r\nthem from search. Paul saw his opportunity in the annoyance which the\r\nBritish system caused to neutral states, and in May and June, 1800,\r\ninvited Sweden and Denmark to resist it. In July a Danish frigate, the\r\n_Freya_, with a convoy was stopped by British ships in the Channel; her\r\ncaptain refused to allow the ships under his convoy to be searched, and\r\nafter a short resistance the _Freya_ was captured and taken into the\r\nDowns. The government despatched Whitworth to Copenhagen to remonstrate\r\non this act of war on the part of Denmark, and enforced his\r\nrepresentations by sending a squadron into the Sound.\r\n\r\nChristian VII. gave way, and promised to send no more convoys until the\r\nquestion was decided by treaty. He complained to Russia, and Paul in\r\nNovember laid an embargo on all British ships, imprisoned the crews of\r\nthose in his ports, and seized British merchandise. He further invited\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Prussia to form an alliance for the protection of\r\ntheir flags on the basis of insisting that the neutral flag should cover\r\nan enemy's goods, not being contraband of war, that contraband should\r\nnot include naval stores, and that if a declaration of blockade was to\r\nbe respected, the blockade must be effectual, and that ships convoyed by\r\na man-of-war belonging to their sovereign should be exempt from search\r\nby a belligerent on a declaration by the captain of the convoying ship\r\nthat they were not carrying contraband goods. This move was highly\r\ngratifying to Bonaparte, for it struck at England's naval and commercial\r\nascendency, and a treaty which he concluded with the United States in\r\nSeptember contained provisions of a like kind. Frederick William III. of\r\nPrussia, seeing that Austria was at its last gasp, was anxious to please\r\nhim, for he hoped to gain some advantage from him in Germany, and\r\nspecially coveted the possession of Hanover. He complained that a\r\nPrussian ship, laden with timber and bound for Amsterdam, had been\r\nseized by a British cruiser and taken into Cuxhaven, a port belonging to\r\nthe state of Hamburg, and he ordered his troops to occupy Cuxhaven, a\r\nmeasure which threatened George's electoral dominions. That would not in\r\nitself have concerned England, but Cuxhaven was at the mouth of the\r\nElbe, the principal route by which British commerce was carried on with\r\ncentral Europe. In the existing state of affairs it was not advisable to\r\ngive the Prussian king a cause of grievance. The government, therefore,\r\ndirected the restoration of the ship in the hope of pacifying him, but\r\nhe nevertheless persisted in the occupation of the port. On December 16\r\nthe maritime confederacy was signed by Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, and\r\non the 18th by Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLAND TO BE HUMBLED._]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1801, Paul sent an ambassador to Paris to arrange a treaty\r\nof alliance. Bonaparte's hopes seemed likely to be more than fulfilled.\r\nAn attempt made on his life on December 24, which many Frenchmen\r\nabsurdly believed to have been abetted by the English government, gave\r\nhim the opportunity of crushing his domestic foes. England, the object\r\nof his passionate hatred, was bereft of her Austrian ally; he was\r\npressing Spain to invade Portugal unless she would close her ports\r\nagainst English ships; the northern powers were striking at England's\r\nmaritime lordship; her navy would be deprived of stores, and her people\r\nof foreign wheat. An alliance with Russia would enable France to become\r\ndominant in central Europe, to overthrow the British supremacy in the\r\nMediterranean, and to preserve her hold on Egypt. Soon every state would\r\nshut its ports against British ships, and England's sea-power would be\r\noverthrown by the power of France on land. Paul held out yet greater\r\nhopes; he would undertake a joint invasion of India and drive the\r\nBritish from the east. Though his wild schemes did not meet with\r\nBonaparte's approval, Paul set an army in motion for the conquest of\r\nIndia. Yet neither the government nor the people of England was dismayed\r\nby the isolation of their country nor the number of their foes. Nor had\r\nthey cause. Bonaparte, great general as he was, could not understand the\r\nnature of England's strength, and was indeed profoundly ignorant of all\r\nthat concerned maritime power and commerce. The British navy was in\r\nadmirable condition, both as regards material and men; it was blockading\r\nthe Dutch in the Texel, and the ships of France and Spain in every port\r\nin which they lay from Toulon to Flushing, and the thunder of its guns\r\nwas soon to be heard in the north. In India Lord Wellesley had not only\r\ncrushed resistance and added a vast territory to the company's\r\npossessions, but was establishing the British rule on a firm basis, and\r\nthere, too, British ships would have to be reckoned with. On January 14\r\nthe government placed an embargo on the ships of Russia, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark. Orders were sent for the capture of the Danish colonies in the\r\nWest Indies, and a fleet was prepared to sail for the Baltic under Sir\r\nHyde Parker, and with Nelson as second in command.\r\n\r\nYet, though undismayed by her foes, England was sorely dismayed by the\r\nsufferings of her poor. Peace was very needful for her. Wealth indeed\r\nwas rapidly increasing; her foreign trade which in 1792 was L44,500,000\r\nin value had risen to over L73,750,000. But the poor lacked bread. The\r\nincrease in the manufacturing population caused an increased demand for\r\nfood, and England depended on supplies of cereals from abroad. The war\r\nrestricted the importation of corn and sent up its price. The hopes\r\nfixed on the harvest of 1800 were disappointed; the stock of the\r\nprevious year was exhausted, and wheat rose to the famine price of\r\n120s. a quarter. Bread riots were raised in various places, and were in\r\nsome cases due to a belief, existing even among persons of education,\r\nthat the high price of corn was largely caused by the dealers. Some\r\ndealers were prosecuted under the old statutes against \"forestalling and\r\nregrating,\" and when one named Rusby, charged with buying oats at 41s. a\r\nquarter and selling them again in the same market at 44s., was found\r\nguilty, Lord Kenyon congratulated the jury on the benefit which their\r\nverdict conferred on the country. On appeal his law was questioned and\r\nthe proceedings dropped. The future looked even darker than the present,\r\nfor the Russian embargo cut off a main source of supply. The desire for\r\npeace was general. Pitt, whose health was giving way, was full of\r\nanxiety, for the scarcity seemed likely to embarrass the government in\r\nits efforts to maintain the honour of England, and might even compel the\r\ncountry to assent to a peace alike disadvantageous and fallacious. \"The\r\nquestion of peace or war,\" he wrote in October, \"is not in itself so\r\nformidable as that of the scarcity with which it is combined\".\r\n\r\nHe determined on an early meeting of parliament, believing that some\r\nrelief might be afforded by legislation, and that, at the least, it\r\nwould quiet the public mind and check the rise of disaffection. Besides\r\nmeasures for the encouragement of home agriculture, which would\r\nnecessarily operate slowly, he planned others to meet the immediate\r\ncrisis, for though as a disciple of Adam Smith he disliked interference\r\nwith the regular course of trade, he considered that the situation of\r\nthe country rendered some regulation necessary. Grenville differed from\r\nhim. He held closely to the maxims of political economy, and though he\r\ndid not oppose him in the cabinet, he urged on Pitt in private that all\r\ninterference with the process by which supply and demand counteracted\r\neach other must be harmful. Pitt held to his own opinion. Parliament met\r\non November 11. The king's speech invited it to consider means by which\r\nagriculture might be extended, and, for the present, the best means of\r\nstimulating the importation of grain and promoting frugality in using\r\nit, and checked the foolish and mischievous outcry against the dealers\r\nby pointing out that the ordinary practices of buying and selling were\r\nnecessary in the existing state of society. Acting on the reports of\r\ncommittees, parliament granted bounties on the importation of corn and\r\nrice, and prohibited the use of corn in distillery and the manufacture\r\nof starch, the exportation of provisions, the making of bread solely\r\nfrom fine flour, and the sale of bread within twenty-four hours of its\r\nbaking. The opposition reproached the government, and especially Pitt,\r\nwith having caused the scarcity by the rejection of Bonaparte's\r\nproposals for peace; but motions for an inquiry into the state of the\r\nnation, for immediate negotiations with France, and for the dismissal of\r\nthe ministers received scarcely any support. It was not from parliament\r\nthat Pitt's ministry was to receive its death-blow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IRISH UNION DESIRABLE._]\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the Irish rebellion was quelled, the project of a\r\nlegislative union with Great Britain was publicly discussed. Such a\r\nunion existed from 1654 to the restoration in 1660. At the time of the\r\nunion with Scotland, in 1703 and 1707, the Irish parliament proposed a\r\nunion, and its wish was disregarded. Since then various writers on\r\npolitics had recommended it, chiefly as a means of giving Ireland\r\nfreedom of trade. The improvement in the material condition of the\r\ncountry which began in the fourth decade of the century strengthened the\r\nspirit of nationality, the Irish interest became dominant in politics,\r\nreligious animosity decreased, and during the American war Ireland,\r\ninstead of looking to a union as a means of attaining prosperity, found\r\nherself in a position to demand the concessions she desired. The\r\nabolition of restrictions on her trade in 1779-80 removed the chief\r\nmotive which had impelled Scotland towards union; the grant of\r\nlegislative independence fostered the national pride. The constitution\r\nof 1782 left Ireland connected with Great Britain only by the unity of\r\nthe executive in both countries. The Irish parliament might have\r\nexpressed disapproval of a war or alliance entered on by Great Britain\r\nand might have refused supplies; it might have imposed excessive duties\r\non English goods, might have refused a commercial compact with Great\r\nBritain, and did so in 1785; it might have taken a different course from\r\nthe British parliament on a constitutional question, and did so on the\r\nregency question in 1789. The empire was weakened by lack of union.\r\nEnglish statesmen, and above all Pitt, saw that the tie, precarious in\r\nquiet times, might break under some stress, and desired to strengthen it\r\nby an incorporate union, and the king heartily agreed with them.\r\n\r\nFor Ireland a union afforded the only chance of tranquillity, for\r\ncatholic emancipation could not safely be granted without it. Since the\r\nextension of the suffrage to Roman catholics in 1793, emancipation\r\nunaccompanied by union would have placed the government of the country\r\nin the hands of a popish democracy; for the catholics outnumbered the\r\nprotestants by three to one, and the act of 1793 established little\r\nshort of manhood suffrage. A catholic parliament would have made Ireland\r\nno place for protestants, and would have provoked a civil war, in which,\r\nunlike the late rebellion, England would probably have had almost the\r\nwhole catholic population arrayed against her. With a united parliament\r\nthe catholics might enjoy equal privileges with their protestant\r\nneighbours, and would be powerless to oppress them. The war with France\r\nrevealed the dangers of the existing system; the rebellion left the two\r\nreligious parties at deadly feud; the protestants feared catholic\r\nvengeance, the catholics held the protestant ascendency in deeper hatred\r\nsince the rise of Orangeism and the barbarities of '98. The time seemed\r\nripe for the fulfilment of Pitt's long-cherished hope of union. He\r\ndesired to do the catholics justice and intended that the union should\r\nprovide for emancipation, a provision for their priesthood, to be\r\naccompanied by an increase of the _regium donum_, the endowment granted\r\nby William III. for the support of the Irish presbyterian ministers, and\r\nthe commutation of tithe; and this comprehensive scheme was warmly\r\napproved by Cornwallis. But the principal men of the government party in\r\nIreland were strongly opposed to the admission of catholics into the\r\nunited parliament, and in October, 1798, Clare convinced Pitt that the\r\nproposal would wreck the chances of union. Pitt therefore dissociated\r\nemancipation from union, adopted a scheme of union on a protestant\r\nbasis, and left the settlement of the just claims of the catholics,\r\nwhich was necessary to the successful working of a union, to be effected\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATHOLIC SUPPORT._]\r\n\r\nThe intended union was announced and advocated in a pamphlet by Cooke,\r\nthe Irish under-secretary. The protestants generally were hostile to the\r\nscheme, some from feelings of national pride, others from dislike to the\r\nthreatened overthrow of the political ascendency of their party.\r\nCatholic support might be gained if there was reason to expect that\r\nunion would be followed by emancipation, a provision for the clergy,\r\nwhich would entail a royal power of veto over episcopal appointments,\r\nand the commutation of tithe. Dublin was strongly against a measure\r\nwhich would injure its position as a capital; and the lawyers, who would\r\nalso lose by it, were formidable opponents. In preparation for the\r\ncoming struggle the government informed the catholic bishops that,\r\nthough emancipation could not be included in the measure, they were\r\nanxious to make provision for their clergy; a few anti-unionist\r\nofficials resigned or were dismissed, and the demands of some of the\r\ngovernment party, who, as usual, clamoured to be rewarded beforehand,\r\nappeared to have been satisfied. The king's speech at the opening of the\r\nIrish parliament on January 22, 1799, though not mentioning union,\r\nrecommended some effectual means of strengthening the connexion. The\r\naddress was carried in the lords by 52 votes to 17. In the commons it\r\nwas moved by Lord Castlereagh, the chief secretary, and was strongly\r\nopposed by Plunket, Ponsonby, and others. After a debate which lasted\r\nfrom 4 P.M. to 1 P.M. the next day, the government had a majority of\r\nonly one, and in a subsequent division was in a minority of 5. On the\r\n31st Pitt, in an eloquent speech, moved resolutions for a union in the\r\nBritish house of commons. Sheridan, Grey, and Burke's friend, Laurence,\r\nfought hard against them, but were in a minority which varied from 45 to\r\n15. In the lords they were agreed to without a division, and in April\r\nboth houses adopted an address in favour of union.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the government in the Irish parliament was hailed with\r\ndelight and rioting in Dublin. The prospects of the union soon began to\r\nbrighten. The cabinet made it clear that the measure would not be\r\nabandoned. As it seemed likely that the protestants would offer the\r\ncatholics emancipation in order to induce them to combine against union,\r\nCornwallis was authorised to declare that the government would resist to\r\nthe utmost any concession to the catholics so long as a separate\r\nparliament existed. No definite promise was made to the catholics, but\r\ntheir hopes were excited. In the autumn, Castlereagh, who came over for\r\nthe purpose, represented to the cabinet the importance of gaining their\r\nsupport; he was told to inform Cornwallis that the cabinet was\r\nfavourable to emancipation, and that without giving the catholics \"any\r\ndirect assurance,\" he might safely solicit their support. This he did\r\nwith general success; and the catholic bishops and many of their\r\nclergy, allured by the prospect of a provision from government, were\r\nactive on the unionist side. The unionist party was further strengthened\r\nby the state of the country. Many districts were infested by bands of\r\nmen, survivals of the rebel armies, who murdered, robbed, and\r\nintimidated their neighbours, and mutilated cattle. A fresh outbreak of\r\nrebellion seemed likely in the spring; the large British force already\r\nin Ireland was augmented, and an act was passed giving the\r\nlord-lieutenant power to authorise the capital or other punishment of\r\nthose convicted by court-martial of rebellion or attacks on the king's\r\nsubjects. The opinion that Ireland needed a new system of government\r\ngained ground. Yet the feeling against union remained overwhelmingly\r\ngeneral, specially among the protestants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A MAJORITY SECURED._]\r\n\r\nA majority in parliament had to be gained by the ministers. The county\r\nmembers, who were independent, for the most part were, and remained,\r\nanti-unionists. The preponderance of power lay with the 236 members for\r\nthe 118 boroughs, of which only eight were free from all patronage.\r\nNearly all the remainder belonged to borough-owners and were regarded as\r\ntheir personal property. A large number of them would be disfranchised\r\nby a union. Not to compensate the owners would have been contrary to the\r\ngeneral moral standard of the age when uninfluenced by party feelings,\r\nand would have made union impossible. As Pitt in his reform bill of 1785\r\nproposed to buy up the patronage of the English close boroughs, so the\r\ngovernment determined to compensate those Irish borough-owners whose\r\nboroughs were to lose both members. The price of each borough was\r\neventually fixed at L15,000, the market value, and as eighty-four were\r\ndisfranchised, the sum paid for them was L1,260,000. This was not\r\nbribery; it was an open transaction, and the money was paid alike to\r\nopponents and supporters of the union. The services of great men were\r\nsecured by peerages and other dignities. During and at the end of the\r\nstruggle twenty new Irish peerages were created, sixteen peers were\r\npromoted, and five received English peerages. Most of these grants were\r\nmere bribes, and so too were the many places and pensions which helped\r\nto swell the unionist party in parliament. Some money, though the amount\r\nmust have been small, was probably also spent in bribery. The government\r\nwould not risk a general election; the union was to be carried by the\r\nexisting parliament. Gradually sixty-three vacancies were created in the\r\ncommons, some by death, some by acceptance of office, most of them\r\ndoubtless by the resignation of members who would not follow their\r\npatrons by becoming unionists, and others, probably, through the\r\npurchase of seats by the government from sitting members. The vacancies\r\nwere eventually filled by supporters of the union. While, then, the\r\nextent of the corruption practised by the government has been\r\nexaggerated, the union was undoubtedly carried by corrupt means.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pitt did not corrupt the Irish parliament; it was corrupt\r\nalready: he merely continued the immemorial methods of dealing with it\r\non a larger scale than before. Nobles and gentry chose to sell\r\nthemselves, and, in order to rid Ireland of a source of trouble and\r\ndanger, and Great Britain of a cause of weakness, he paid them their\r\nprice. Cornwallis murmured at having to negotiate and job with \"the most\r\ncorrupt people under heaven\"; but he did his share of the work.\r\nCastlereagh, personally not less honourable, who had much of it to do,\r\ndid it without compunction, for it was, he said, \"to buy out and secure\r\nto the crown for ever the fee-simple of Irish corruption, which has so\r\nlong enfeebled the powers of the government and endangered the\r\nconnection\". It was essential to the welfare both of Great Britain and\r\nIreland that the union should be effected, and that it should be\r\neffected without delay; and it could not have been effected by any other\r\nmeans than those which Pitt adopted. It was better by giving these\r\ngreedy politicians their price to put an end to a system maintained by\r\nperpetual corruption, worked in the interests of an ascendant minority,\r\ndistrusted by the mass of the people, incapable of affording the country\r\nthe blessings of domestic peace, and dangerous to the security of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe Irish parliament began its last session on January 15, 1800, and the\r\naddress was hotly debated. Grattan, who had not appeared there since\r\n1797, spoke with extraordinary eloquence in support of an amendment on\r\nthe side of legislative independence. Though the vacant seats were not\r\nnearly all filled up, the amendment was rejected by 138 votes to 96. The\r\nanti-unionists were furious; they raised a fund of L100,000, paid or\r\npromised, for the purpose of out-buying the ministers, bought some\r\nseats, and paid and offered bribes. The catholics, the yeomanry, and\r\nthe Orangemen were urged to combine to withstand the union. Some rioting\r\ntook place in Dublin, but there was no serious outbreak; for the Orange\r\ngrand lodge kept the society quiet, and the mass of the people, except\r\nwhen excited by agitation, regarded the question with indifference. A\r\nfierce struggle ensued in parliament, and it was not until March 28 that\r\nthe articles of union were carried and sent to England. They were\r\ndebated at some length in both houses of the English parliament, but\r\nwere carried by large majorities. They were next presented in the Irish\r\nparliament in the form of a bill. It was vehemently opposed. In the\r\ndebate on the commitment, on May 26, Grattan delivered an oration\r\nagainst it, splendid in diction and inflammatory in tone, and was\r\nanswered by Castlereagh who spoke, as indeed he spoke throughout these\r\ndebates, with conspicuous dignity and moderation. The majority for\r\ncommitting the bill was 118 to 73. It was then passed by the English\r\nparliament and received the royal assent on August 1. A new great seal\r\nand a new royal standard were made for the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, and on January 1, 1801, the king's new title was\r\nproclaimed, from which the words \"King of France,\" retained since the\r\ntime of Edward III., were omitted.\r\n\r\nBy the act of union Ireland was to be represented in the united\r\nparliament, in the upper house by four spiritual lords sitting in\r\nrotation and twenty-eight temporal lords elected for life by the Irish\r\npeerage, and in the lower by 100 members.[313] The right of the crown to\r\ncreate fresh Irish peerages was restricted. The established Church of\r\nIreland was declared one with the Church of England, and the\r\npreservation of the united Church of England and Ireland was to be \"an\r\nessential and fundamental part of the union\". Commercial interests were\r\nmainly settled in accordance with the proposals of 1785, and some Irish\r\nmanufactures were temporarily protected from suffering by British\r\ncompetition. The debts of the two countries were to be kept separate for\r\ntwenty years, or until they should be to each other in the same\r\nproportion as the respective contributions of the two countries; and\r\nuntil their amalgamation the annual contribution of Great Britain\r\ntowards the expenditure of the United Kingdom was fixed at fifteen parts\r\nand of Ireland at two parts. The first session of the united parliament\r\nwas opened on January 22, 1801, the members for Great Britain being the\r\nsame as those of the previous parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CATHOLIC QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nThe Irish catholics could have prevented the union. They made it\r\npossible, some by giving active help, others by maintaining neutrality;\r\nand though no definite promise had been made to them, they were led to\r\nexpect that union would be followed by emancipation, a provision for\r\ntheir clergy, and the commutation of tithe. Pitt recognised this, and\r\nfurther held that his work would be incomplete without these healing\r\nmeasures, which would give \"full effect to the great object of the\r\nunion--that of tranquillising Ireland and attaching it to this country\".\r\nAccordingly, in September, 1800, as soon as the union was effected, he\r\ncalled a meeting of the cabinet to consider these questions. He said\r\nnothing to the king on the subject, thinking, doubtless, that it would\r\nbe less difficult to gain his consent if a complete plan was presented\r\nto him as the policy adopted by the cabinet. The risk was great, for in\r\n1795 George, as we have seen, held that to consent to emancipation would\r\nbe a breach of his coronation oath, and so lately as the autumn of 1799\r\nhe told Dundas that he hoped the government was \"not pledged to anything\r\nin favour of the Roman catholics\". Loughborough, the chancellor, saw an\r\nopportunity for ingratiating himself by betraying the prime minister.\r\nWhen he received Pitt's letter summoning him to the cabinet meeting on\r\nthe catholic question, he was with the king at Weymouth, where George\r\noften resided in the summer since his recovery in 1789. He showed the\r\nking Pitt's letter, excited him against emancipation, and furnished him\r\nwith arguments. Lord Auckland, the postmaster-general, who was allied\r\nwith the chief Irish anti-catholics, was his cousin, and, probably at\r\nAuckland's suggestion, the Archbishops of Canterbury and Armagh wrote to\r\nthe king to strengthen him against emancipation. When the cabinet met,\r\nLoughborough agreed to the commutation of tithe, but objected to any\r\nfurther concession, and the matter was adjourned.\r\n\r\nPitt again brought it before the cabinet in January, 1801. The king's\r\nfeelings were then generally known, and the Duke of Portland and Lords\r\nWestmorland and Liverpool more or less decidedly joined Loughborough in\r\nopposing emancipation. On the 28th George attacked Dundas on the subject\r\nat a levee: \"I shall,\" he said, \"reckon any man my personal enemy who\r\nproposes such a measure\". He requested Addington, the speaker, to\r\nremonstrate with Pitt. On the 31st Pitt wrote him a long letter setting\r\nforth the general grounds of his desire for emancipation, by the\r\nsubstitution of a political oath for the sacramental test, and for a\r\nprovision for the catholic clergy, adding that if the king refused his\r\nconsent, he must resign office. George, after taking counsel with\r\nAddington, replied that he was bound by his coronation oath to refuse\r\nhis consent, and proposed that both he and Pitt should say no more on\r\nthe subject. In answer Pitt wrote on February 3 that he must resign\r\noffice as soon as a new ministry could be formed. George, who was\r\nincapable of appreciating his splendid services, and showed later that\r\nhe must often have chafed under his control, invited Addington, a dull\r\nman after his own heart, to form a ministry. He consented, and on the\r\n5th the king accepted Pitt's resignation. Dundas, Grenville, Spencer,\r\nand Windham decided to go out with Pitt, so did Canning and others who\r\nheld minor offices, and Cornwallis and Castlereagh also retired. Pitt\r\npromised his help to Addington, whose father had physicked the Pitt\r\nfamily, and persuaded some of his followers to join the new ministry. As\r\nit was to be an anti-catholic ministry, his conduct has been held to\r\nprove that he was paving his way to a return to office, and that the\r\nchange, so far as he was concerned, was, to use Fox's expression, \"a\r\njuggle\". It should be remembered that the country was engaged in a\r\ndeadly conflict, and that its safety was always Pitt's first\r\nconsideration. Emancipation was hopeless. He had felt bound in honour to\r\nbreak up a strong ministry because he could not carry it, and it was his\r\nduty to do what he could to strengthen the new ministry so long as it\r\ndid not prove incapable of guiding the country in critical times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT'S IMPENDING RESIGNATION._]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in every part of these transactions, his conduct was\r\nhonourable and straightforward. He would not continue in office when\r\nthwarted by the king on a question of great importance, nor would he\r\nconsent to disappoint hopes which he had encouraged and by which he had\r\nbenefited. That he was influenced by any other motive, such as that his\r\ncontinuance in office would hinder peace, is a vain imagining. He has\r\nbeen blamed by an eminent historian for not having persevered in his\r\nattempt to overcome the king's determination, which on other occasions\r\nhad yielded to pressure.[314] On none of these occasions had George's\r\nreligious convictions been concerned. Some experience of the power\r\nexercised by religious prejudice in strengthening the resistance which a\r\nnaturally obstinate person can make to reason, persuasion, and the force\r\nof circumstances, leads me to believe that Pitt was right in accepting\r\nthe king's decision as final and in not engaging in a struggle which\r\nmight, especially at that time, have had disastrous consequences. Short\r\nof such a struggle he did insist on his policy in the only way open to\r\nhim; he resigned. Where he was to blame, and he acknowledged it, was in\r\nkeeping his intentions secret from the king. Whether if he had\r\ncommunicated them to the king at an early date, he would have gradually\r\nwon George over to his policy, it is impossible to say; he certainly\r\nwent the wrong way to work in disregarding the right of the crown to be\r\nconsulted on the policy which the prime minister hopes to carry out.\r\n\r\nThe impending resignations were announced in parliament, and Sir John\r\nMitford, the attorney-general, was chosen speaker in place of Addington,\r\nbut the completion of the ministerial arrangements was delayed, and Pitt\r\nremained _de facto_ prime minister. To prevent public inconvenience he\r\nbrought forward his budget on the 18th. He announced a loan of\r\nL25,500,000 for Great Britain and L1,500,000 for Ireland, afterwards\r\nincreased by another L1,000,000, which the commercial prosperity of the\r\ncountry, though then in the ninth year of the war, had enabled him to\r\nnegotiate, at the rate of about 5-1/4 per cent., and he proposed\r\nfourteen new taxes to defray the interest. The budget was well received.\r\nThe delay in the change of ministry was prolonged by the king's illness.\r\nHe had been much excited and distressed by the late events, and on the\r\n20th again became insane. The Prince of Wales approached Pitt on the\r\nsubject of a regency, and Pitt told him that, if the necessity should\r\narise, he should propose the restrictions of 1789. By March 6 the\r\nking's condition was materially improved and the question became of no\r\nfurther importance. George bade Willis, his doctor, tell Pitt that he\r\nwas quite well, adding, \"but what has he not to answer for who is the\r\ncause of my having been ill at all?\" Pitt was much distressed. Would an\r\nassurance, he asked Willis, that he would not again trouble the king on\r\nthe catholic question \"be material to his health?\" \"Certainly,\" Willis\r\nreplied, \"and to his life also.\"[315] Pitt bade him give the king the\r\nassurance. George was much comforted. Pitt's surrender has been blamed\r\nin strong terms.[316] It cannot be defended completely. The question was\r\nof deep importance to Ireland, and he treated it as a personal matter.\r\nIt is, however, unfair to represent his conduct as an attempt to resume\r\noffice. His followers constantly urged him to invite Addington to\r\nretire, for they justly regarded him as incompetent, and when they heard\r\nof Pitt's message to the king, they expected that their wish would be\r\nfulfilled. But Addington had received his appointment, and was not\r\nlikely to resign it willingly, and Pitt, as Canning complained, would\r\nnot make any \"forward movement towards the king\". Nothing was to be got\r\nfrom him except that, if the king and Addington earnestly wished him to\r\ncontinue, he was ready to discuss matters. On the strength of this,\r\nDundas and others went to Addington, who rejected their proposal that he\r\nshould offer to make way for Pitt, and Pitt himself told them that their\r\naction was improper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PITT RESIGNS OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nPitt would willingly have continued in office. He loved power, and he\r\nknew that England needed him and the strong ministry of which he was the\r\nhead and soul, but he was not a man to barter principle for office. His\r\nmessage to the king is intelligible, as a prime minister of our own time\r\nhas pointed out, without so mean an interpretation.[317] He recognised\r\nthat while the king lived catholic emancipation could not be gained save\r\nat too high a price. George was sixty-two, and his life was thought to\r\nbe precarious; no one could foresee that he would outlive Pitt, who was\r\ntwenty years younger. An attempt to force the question on him would\r\nhave again brought on insanity, and would perhaps have killed him. Pitt\r\nwas deeply moved by the king's words, and yielded to feelings of pity\r\nand personal affection for the sovereign he had served for seventeen\r\nyears. On March 14 he gave back the seal of the exchequer into the\r\nking's hands. Once again then, and not for the last time, did George\r\ndefeat the policy of his ministers and drive them from office. In this\r\ncase the blame chiefly rests on the traitor Loughborough, who, for his\r\nown purposes, happily to be foiled, interfered between the king and Pitt\r\nand excited the king's religious prejudices. But George's conduct at\r\nthis crisis cannot be viewed wholly apart from his earlier attempts at\r\npersonal rule, for it proves that he was unable to understand that his\r\nministers were responsible for his political acts. His refusal to assent\r\nto emancipation deprived Ireland of the happy results which Pitt\r\nexpected, and brought much trouble on the country. As regards its effect\r\non the empire at large, it is enough to say that it took the helm of\r\nstate out of the hands of Pitt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[301] Grenville to Whitworth, Nov. 1, 1799, MS.

The editions\r\nquoted here are those which have been used.\r\n\r\n(1) General histories of England for the period 1760-1801:--LECKY,\r\n_History of England in the 18th Century_, 8 vols., 1879-90, from which\r\nmuch help has been obtained. It is a work to which every historian of\r\nthe period must be deeply indebted, and though faults may be found with\r\nits plan, it holds a high place among our histories for learning,\r\nmoderation, and philosophical treatment. The history of England is\r\ncarried down to the outbreak of the war in 1793, that of Ireland to the\r\nUnion. ADOLPHUS, _History of England from the Accession of George III._,\r\n8 vols., 1840-45, a laborious and impartial record of events, viewed\r\nfrom a conservative standpoint. MASSEY, _History of England_, 4 vols.,\r\n1855-63, ends 1803, chiefly treating of home affairs; neither animated\r\nnor philosophic, written from a liberal point of view, unduly severe to\r\nthe king, but deriving some value from the author's legal and\r\nparliamentary experience. Lord STANHOPE, _History_, 7 vols., edit. 1853,\r\nvols. iv.-vii., ends 1783, trustworthy, dull, and whiggish. To these\r\nmust be added Sir T. E. MAY (Lord Farnborough), _Constitutional History\r\nof England from 1760 to 1860_, 3 vols., 5th edit., 1875.\r\n\r\n(2) The chief manuscript sources consulted:--The great collection of the\r\n_Duke of Newcastle's Papers_ in Add. MSS., British Museum, extremely\r\nimportant down to 1767, specially with reference to ministerial\r\nintrigues, the old whig methods of government, the negotiations with\r\nFrance in 1761-62, and the growth of the cabinet system. The _Pitt\r\nPapers_, a mass of letters addressed to Pitt (Earl of Chatham) and\r\nWilliam Pitt, and some to Lady Chatham, together with various political\r\nmemoranda. These papers have been sorted into different bundles, to\r\nwhich the numbers given in my footnotes refer, and a manuscript index of\r\nthem has been made by Mrs. Lomas of the Record Office, where they are at\r\npresent deposited by their owner. They have been used in the preparation\r\nof the _Chatham Correspondence_, and by Lord Stanhope, but the field is\r\nlarge and may be gleaned with profit. _Foreign Office Correspondence_\r\n(despatches of ambassadors, etc.). With respect to these, the kind and\r\nefficient help given me by Mr. Hubert Hall, of the Record Office, is\r\ngratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\n(3) Akin to these sources are various publications of the Historical\r\nManuscripts Commission. Among these special reference should be made to\r\nthe Reports on Mr. Fortescue's _Dropmore MSS._, 3 vols., containing the\r\npapers of Lord Grenville, of the highest interest and importance,\r\nspecially from 1793; the Duke of Rutland's _Belvoir MSS._, 3 vols., with\r\n_inter alia_ the fourth Duke of Rutland's correspondence while\r\nlord-lieutenant of Ireland, 1784-87; the _Charlemont MSS._, also\r\nessential for Irish history; _Lord Dartmouth's MSS._, vol. 2, American\r\nPapers to 1776, and Mrs. _Stopford-Sackville's MSS._, and Sir _E.\r\nStrachey's MSS._, both throwing much light on the conduct of the war\r\nwith America.\r\n\r\n(4) Of pre-eminent importance is the _Parliamentary History_, xv.-xxxv.,\r\nand its complement, Sir HENRY CAVENDISH's _Debates of the House of\r\nCommons_ during the parliament of 1768, 2 vols., edit. by Wright, 1841,\r\nbegins May, 1768, and ends March, 1771. It is much to be wished that the\r\nremainder of these valuable reports should be published from the\r\nmanuscript in the British Museum. Dodsley's _Annual Register_ has\r\nhistorical chapters written by Burke, perhaps to 1778, and chapters in\r\nmany later volumes probably written under his supervision; they are of\r\ncourse generally excellent. The volumes for the later years of our\r\nperiod contain many useful state papers. Burke's speeches, pamphlets,\r\nand letters, of which the edition used here is his _Works and\r\nCorrespondence_, 8 vols., 1852. For his life see PRIOR, _Life of Burke_,\r\n2 vols., 5th edit. (Bohn's Lib.), 1854, Mr. J. MORLEY, _Burke_, a\r\nhistorical study, 1867, and _Burke_ (Engl. Men of Letters Series), 1879.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MEMOIRS AND CORRESPONDENCE._]\r\n\r\n(5) Political and other memoirs and printed correspondence:--H. WALPOLE\r\n(Lord Orford), _Letters_, edited by Cunningham, 9 vols., 1880, the\r\nletters in vols. i. and ii. are of earlier dates than 1760. A more\r\ncomplete edition, in 16 vols., by Mrs. P. TOYNBEE, is in course of\r\npublication by the Clarendon Press. WALPOLE'S _Memoirs of the Reign of\r\nGeorge III._, 1760-72, edited by Mr. Russell Barker, 4 vols., 1894, and\r\nhis _Journals of the Reign_, 1771-83, edited by Doran, 2 vols., 1859.\r\nThese works are of considerable historical value, but Walpole was not a\r\npolitician; he was a whig for personal reasons rather than from\r\nconviction, and his sentiments were largely determined by filial\r\nprejudice and the interests of his friends; his views are generally\r\nsuperficial, and his judgments of persons biassed, sometimes\r\ncontradictory, and often unjust. DODINGTON (Lord Melcombe), _Diary_,\r\nedited by Wyndham, 1785, ending with 1761. HARRIS, _Life of Lord\r\nHardwicke_, 3 vols., 1847, useful to 1764, and with an account of the\r\ncircumstances preceding C. Yorke's death in 1770, written by his\r\nbrother. BISSET, _Memoirs of Sir Andrew Mitchell_, 2 vols., 1850.\r\nMitchell was ambassador at Berlin in 1760 and later. The Memoirs are\r\nbased on his correspondence (Add. MSS. British Museum and elsewhere),\r\nand throw light on the causes of Frederick's angry feelings towards the\r\nBritish government, and the negotiations for peace in 1762. _The\r\nGrenville Papers_, edited by W. J. Smith, 4 vols., 1852, consisting\r\nprincipally of the correspondence of Richard, Earl Temple, and his\r\nbrother George, first lord of the treasury, 1763-65, together with\r\nGeorge Grenville's diary of \"memorable transactions\" during his\r\nadministration, which gives a full account of the relations between the\r\nking and his first minister. The Papers are of primary importance for\r\nthe first eleven years of the reign. [ALMON,] _History of the Late\r\nMinority_, 1765, a clever account of the politics of the parliamentary\r\nopposition from 1761, attributed to Lord Temple, and written in his\r\ninterest. _Correspondence of John, fourth Duke of Bedford_, 3 vols.,\r\n1846, well edited by Lord John (Earl) Russell, the last part of vol. ii.\r\nand vol. iii. cover from 1760 to 1770. The correspondence and extracts\r\nfrom the duke's diary afford a striking picture of the whig system of\r\ngovernment by \"connexion\"; they have much on the negotiations for the\r\nPeace of Paris, the ministerial crises of 1763 and 1765, and the discord\r\nbetween the whigs which was fatal to their chance of effectually\r\nresisting the king's policy. The work is a necessary complement to the\r\nGrenville papers. _A Narrative of the Changes of Ministry, 1765-1767,\r\ntold by the Duke of Newcastle_, edited by Miss M. Bateson for the Royal\r\nHist. Soc. (Camden Series), 1898, from the Newcastle Papers (see sec.\r\n2), giving an interesting account of the king's efforts to supply the\r\nplace of the Grenville ministry, the difficulties both on the king's\r\nside and that of Pitt which kept Pitt out of office, the duke's\r\ndiscomfiture when the king put Pitt in power in July, 1766, and his\r\nattempt in 1767 to arrange a coalition between Grafton and the\r\nRockingham party.\r\n\r\nThe lack of any sufficient biography of Chatham renders _The Chatham\r\nCorrespondence_, 4 vols., 1840 (see sec. 2, _Pitt Papers_), well edited\r\nby Taylor and Captain Pringle, of peculiar importance; vols. ii.-iv.\r\ncontain letters both from and to Chatham, which illustrate the whole of\r\nhis career during our period. Pitt's political position and conduct,\r\n1761-65, and specially his relations with Bute, are the subject of an\r\ninteresting study, _William Pitt und Graf Bute_, by Dr. A. VON RUVILLE,\r\nBerlin, 1895. _William Pitt, Earl of Chatham_ (Heroes of the Nation\r\nSeries), by Mr. W. D. GREEN, M.P., 1901, is good from 1760, so far as\r\nits limits allow. Earl of ALBEMARLE, _Memoirs of the Marquis of\r\nRockingham_, 2 vols., 1852, an ill-arranged book, has letters of value,\r\nexhibits the policy of the Rockingham whigs, their differences with Pitt\r\n(Chatham), and their efforts for reform. _Autobiography and Political\r\nCorrespondence of the Duke of Grafton_, 1898, edited by Sir WILLIAM\r\nANSON, with an excellent introduction and useful footnotes, gives\r\nvaluable notices of the first Rockingham ministry, the weakness of the\r\nadministration formed under Chatham, the collapse of all ministerial\r\nvigour during his illness and when Grafton was nominally at the head of\r\naffairs, and the views of the whigs with regard to the constitution.\r\n_The Correspondence of George III. with Lord North_, 1768-83, 2 vols.,\r\n1867, edited by W. B. Donne, with copious notes and comments, shows the\r\nking's system of personal rule through his ministers in full working,\r\nthe position held by North under it, and his unavailing attempts to\r\nresign office when forced to carry out a policy he disapproved, together\r\nwith much that concerns the conduct of the war. Lord EDMOND FITZMAURICE,\r\n_Life of the Earl of Shelburne_ (Marquis of Lansdowne), 3 vols.,\r\n1875-76, based on papers at Lansdowne House and elsewhere, represents\r\nShelburne's political conduct in as favourable a light as possible; the\r\nparts relating to the quarrel between Shelburne and H. Fox in vol. i.,\r\nthe negotiations in Paris in 1782 and 1783, and the quarrel with C. J.\r\nFox, are perhaps specially useful, but the whole work down to 1784 is\r\nnecessary and authoritative.\r\n\r\nLord STANHOPE, _Life of Pitt_, 4 vols., 2nd edit., 1862, founded on\r\nunpublished papers (see sec. 2, _Pitt Papers_); a good biography and a\r\nstandard and indispensable work. With this should be read Lord ROSEBERY,\r\n_Pitt_ (Twelve English Statesmen Series), 1891, an admirable\r\nappreciation of Pitt's work and character. Lord JOHN (Earl) RUSSELL,\r\n_Memorials and Correspondence of C. J. Fox_, 4 vols., 1853, has many\r\nletters of importance, but is otiosely edited, and _Life of C. J. Fox_,\r\n3 vols., 1859-67, more concerned with politics, which it treats from a\r\nstrongly whig standpoint, than with biography. Sir G. O. TREVELYAN,\r\n_Early History of C. J. Fox_, 1880, written on the whig side, ends with\r\n1774. _Court and Cabinets of George III._, edited by the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, 4 vols., 1853-55 (vol. i. begins at 1782, and 1801 is\r\nreached early in vol. iii.), contains the correspondence of the brothers\r\nLord Temple (later Marquis of Buckingham), Thomas, and W. W. Grenville\r\n(later Lord Grenville); the letters of the last named are of much value;\r\nthey are supplemented by the _Dropmore MSS._ (see sec. 2). _Diaries and\r\nCorrespondence of the First Earl of Malmesbury_, 4 vols., 1844, edited\r\nby the third earl, chiefly concerned with the foreign relations of Great\r\nBritain; his despatches, letters, and journal while minister at St.\r\nPetersburg, 1770-80, at the Hague, 1784-88, at Berlin, 1793, and during\r\nhis mission to Paris in 1796, and to Lille in 1797, are of first-rate\r\nimportance. In vol. ii. are reports of two conferences with the Prince\r\nof Wales on the subject of his debts in 1785. Malmesbury (Sir James\r\nHarris) was one of the Portland whigs, joined in their secession, and\r\nwas much trusted by Pitt. _Correspondence of Marquis Cornwallis_, 3\r\nvols., 1859, well edited by C. Ross, has several letters relating to the\r\nwar with America, an account of his interview with Frederick of Prussia\r\nin 1785, many despatches and letters written by him as governor-general\r\nof India, 1786-92, and a large mass of correspondence during his\r\nvice-royalty of Ireland, 1798-1801. _Journal and Correspondence of Lord\r\nAuckland_, 4 vols., 1861-62, edited feebly by Lord Auckland, Bishop of\r\nBath and Wells. Auckland (Eden) was a personal friend of Pitt until\r\n1801. His letters while ambassador at Paris, 1785-87; correspondence\r\nrelating to the regency question, 1788; his letters from the Hague,\r\n1792-93; some on the course of the war, and those referring to the\r\nrecall of Fitzwilliam and to the catholic question in 1801, are to be\r\nnoted. He was chief secretary for Ireland in 1780, and was closely\r\nallied with Beresford and the protestant ascendency party. _Political\r\nMemoranda of the Duke of Leeds_, edited by Mr. O. Browning for the\r\nCamden Soc., 1884, specially valuable for its account of the whig scheme\r\nfor a coalition in 1792. Also edited by Mr. Browning, _Despatches of\r\nEarl Gower_, 1885. Gower was ambassador at Paris, 1790-92. Lady MINTO,\r\n_Life of Sir Gilbert Elliot, afterwards Lord Minto, to 1806_, 3 vols.,\r\n1874; vol. i. contains information as to the illness of the king and the\r\nregency question; vol. ii. as to the secession of the Portland whigs;\r\nElliot, whose sister married Lord Auckland, and whose wife was a sister\r\nof Lady Malmesbury, was one of the party. His letters, while he was\r\nemployed on a diplomatic mission at Toulon during the siege, as viceroy\r\nof Corsica, at Naples, and as minister at Vienna, 1799-1801, are worthy\r\nof attention. Sir N. W. WRAXALL, _Historical and Posthumous Memoirs_,\r\n1772-84, 5 vols., 1884, carefully edited by Mr. H. B. Wheatley, diffuse\r\nand amusing. Wraxall's inaccuracies, or worse, have been exaggerated,\r\nand his work, which goes to 1789, together with some later\r\n\"reminiscences,\" is of value, specially as regards its portraiture of\r\npublic men of a secondary rank. Wraxall was a follower of North until\r\n1783, and afterwards, until he resigned his seat in 1794, generally\r\nsupported Pitt. _Diaries and Correspondence of George Rose_, 2 vols.,\r\n1860, edited by L. V. Harcourt. Rose was secretary to the treasury\r\nduring the whole of Pitt's first administration, and was intimate with\r\nhim. Vol. i. contains, among other matters, an account of Pitt's\r\nresignation; vol. ii. has some reminiscences which the king communicated\r\nto Rose in 1804. _The Diary and Correspondence of Abbot, Lord\r\nColchester_, edited by his son, 3 vols., 1861, vol. i. and PELLEW, _Life\r\nof Lord Sidmouth_ (Addington), 3 vols., 1847, vol. i. should be\r\nconsulted for the circumstances of Pitt's retirement. Lord HOLLAND,\r\n_Memoirs of the Whig Party_, 2 vols., 1852, edited by his son, Lord\r\nHolland. As the writer was the nephew of Fox, who was much attached to\r\nhim, and by 1800 was himself a prominent member of the party, these\r\npapers have great authority; many of them refer to events and persons\r\nbelonging to our period. Along with much else which does not concern\r\npolitical history, the _Life of William Wilberforce_, by his sons, 5\r\nvols., 1838, contains some interesting notices of public affairs before\r\n1801, along with a record of Wilberforce's efforts in and out of\r\nparliament for the abolition of the slave trade. See also _Private\r\nPapers of W. Wilberforce_, 1897, with a character of Pitt by\r\nWilberforce.\r\n\r\n(6) Miscellaneous books, pamphlets, etc. On public finance, see\r\nHAMILTON, _Inquiry concerning ... the National Debt_, 1813; NEWMARCH,\r\n_On the Loans Raised by Mr. Pitt_, 1793-1801, a highly valuable and\r\ninteresting treatise; _Parliamentary Report, Accounts_, xxxiii., 1858,\r\non the national debt, and S. DOWELL, _History of Taxation in England_, 4\r\nvols., 1884. On the commercial treaty with France of 1786, see Count DE\r\nBUTENVAL, _Precis du Traite de Commerce_, 1786, Paris, 1869, and\r\nAuckland Corr. as above. Some of the articles by Sir G. C. LEWIS,\r\n_Administrations of Great Britain_, 1783-1830, edited by Sir E. Head,\r\n1864, are founded on Memoirs, etc., noted in sec. 5, and are excellent\r\ncommentaries on them. The private life of the king is written by JESSE,\r\n_Memoirs of the Life and Reign of George III._, 3 vols., 2nd edit.,\r\n1867, in itself scarcely to be reckoned as of historical value, but\r\ngiving copious references to authorities. Life at the court is vividly\r\ndescribed in Madame D'ARBLAY'S (Miss Burney's) _Diary_, 7 vols., 1854; a\r\nnew edition by Mr. Austin Dobson is in course of publication. The Diary\r\nshould be read with an allowance for the writer's dislike of her work at\r\ncourt, which Macaulay does not perhaps sufficiently consider in his\r\nessay. His other essays relating to this period should be read, but the\r\nviews of history which they present must not be accepted in all cases.\r\nBishop DOUGLAS, _Seasonable Hints from an Honest Man_, 1761; _Case of\r\nthe Troops Serving in Germany_, 1781; MAUDUIT, _Occasional Thoughts on\r\nthe Present German War_, 1761, and other pamphlets. Many of the\r\nCaricatures of _Gillray_, _Rowlandson_, and others are valuable as\r\nhistorical documents. In default of the originals, see WRIGHT, _England\r\nunder the House of Hanover_, 2 vols., 3rd edit., 1852, republished in\r\none vol. as _Caricature History of the Georges_ [1867?].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ON THE AMERICAN REBELLION._]\r\n\r\n(7) Of books on the American revolutionary war the best general history\r\nof a popular kind is by Mr. FISKE, _American Revolution_, 2 vols., 1891;\r\nit is written with moderation and a desire for impartiality. GORDON,\r\n_History of the Rise of the Independence of the United States_, 4 vols.,\r\n1788, with many documents. G. BANCROFT, _History of the United States_,\r\ncentenary edition, 1879, vols. iii.-vi. containing the history of the\r\nrevolution, display wonderful industry, but are disfigured by violent\r\npartisanship. _Narrative and Critical History of America_, edited by J.\r\nWinsor, vol. vi., 1888, has some good papers by various writers.\r\n_Cambridge Modern History_, vol. vii., _The United States_, 1903. TYLER,\r\n_Literary History of the American Revolution_, 2 vols., 1879,\r\nillustrates the course of American sentiment during the period. Sir G.\r\nO. TREVELYAN, _The American Revolution_, pts. i. and ii., 3 vols., in\r\nprogress, written on the whig side: the views taken in the present book\r\nas to the causes and character of the dispute, and as to some other\r\npoints are different from those advanced by this distinguished author.\r\nFor the loyalists, L. SABINE, _American Loyalists_, Boston, 1847,\r\nrevised edit., _Biographies, etc._, 2 vols., 1864, and Mr. FLICK,\r\n_Loyalism in New York_ (Columbia University Studies, xiv.). The best\r\npurely military history of the war is by STEDMAN, _History of the\r\nAmerican War_, 2 vols., 4to, 1794; he served under Howe, Clinton, and\r\nCornwallis, and his book is a standard authority. TARLETON, _Campaigns\r\nof 1780, 1781 in the Southern Provinces, 1787._ Other books consulted\r\nare _Washington's Writings and Life,_ by SPARKS, 12 vols., Boston,\r\n1833-39; FRANKLIN, _Works_, edit. Bigelow, 10 vols., N.Y., 1887-88;\r\nTUDOR, _Life of Otis_, Boston, 1823; _Diary and Letters of Thomas\r\nHutchinson_, edited by P. Hutchinson, 2 vols., 1883, 1886; FROTHINGHAM,\r\n_Siege of Boston,_ 1849, a careful piece of work, though written in a\r\nremarkably vainglorious tone; Mr. CODMAN, _Arnold's Expedition to\r\nQuebec_, New York, 1902, an excellent and interesting monograph;\r\nKINGSFORD, _History of Canada_, vol. v., 1892, also deals with the\r\nexpedition. JOHNSTON, _Campaign of_ 1776 (Long Island Hist. Soc.), 1878,\r\na good narrative well furnished with documentary proofs, and by the\r\nsame, _The Yorktown Campaign_, New York, 1881. Judge JONES, _History of\r\nNew York during the War_, 2 vols., New York, 1879-80, edited by Mr. De\r\nLancy, a book of special interest, for Jones was a loyalist; it is\r\nwritten with vigour, and censures the misdeeds on both sides alike. For\r\nBurgoyne's expedition--Sir J. BURGOYNE, _State of the Expedition from\r\nCanada_, 1779, with his defence before the house of commons; FONBLANQUE,\r\n_Episodes from the Life of Burgoyne_, 1876, and Lieut. HADDEN, _Journal\r\nand Orderly-books_, 1886. For Howe's conduct of the war--_Examination of\r\nJoseph Galloway before the House of Commons_, 1779; [Galloway,] _Letters\r\nto a Nobleman_, 1779, Galloway, a Philadelphian lawyer of large\r\nproperty, joined the British in 1776; Sir W. HOWE, _Narrative_ before a\r\ncommittee of the house of commons, April 29, 1779, with _Observations on\r\nLetters to a Nobleman_, 1780; _Detail and Conduct of the War_, including\r\nthe celebrated _Fugitive Pieces_, 1780. Mr. M'CRADY in his _History of\r\nSouth Carolina_: i. _Under Royal Government_, New York, 1899, an able\r\nbook, shows how the desire for independence gained ground in the\r\nprovinces; vols. ii. and iii. _In the Revolution_, 1902, contain a\r\ncareful but tedious narrative, which seems to err in exalting the\r\npartisan commanders, Marion and Sumter, at the expense of Greene. _The\r\nClinton-Cornwallis Controversy_, 2 vols., 1888, edited with minute care\r\nby the late Mr. B. F. STEVENS, and containing all the official letters,\r\norders, and the like of the campaigns in the Carolinas; this elaborate\r\nwork is essential for forming a judgment on the controversy between the\r\ntwo generals. Other authorities more or less bearing on the quarrel with\r\nthe colonies and the subsequent war are noted in other sections.\r\n\r\n(8) On military matters generally:--Colonel the Hon. Sir EDWARD CUST,\r\n_Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century_, iii.-v., 3rd edit.,\r\n1862; the Hon. J. W. FORTESCUE, _A History of the British Army_, 3\r\nvols., 1899-1902, in progress, an important work to which this volume is\r\nindebted, though the view with regard to Clinton and Cornwallis taken by\r\nMr. Fortescue is widely different from that adopted here; M. CHUQUET,\r\n_La jeunesse de Napoleon, Toulon_, 1897, and _Guerres de la Revolution_,\r\n11 vols., in progress, an important work, vol. x. _Valenciennes_, vol.\r\nxi. _Hondschoote_; Sir H. BUNBURY, _Narratives of the Great War with\r\nFrance_, 1854, begins with the campaign in Holland of 1799; DRINKWATER,\r\n_History of the Siege of Gibraltar_, Dublin, 1793; C. J. FOX, _Napoleon\r\nBonaparte and the Siege of Toulon_, Washington, U.S.A., 1902; Dr.\r\nHOLLAND ROSE, _Life of Napoleon I._, 2 vols., 1902, and some other\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ON NAVAL HISTORY._]\r\n\r\n(9) For naval history:--Captain MAHAN, _Influence of Sea Power upon\r\nHistory_, 1889, _Influence of Sea Power on the French Revolution_, 2\r\nvols., 4th edit., 1892, and _Life of Nelson_, 2 vols., 1897, books to\r\nwhich all students of the history of the eighteenth century are deeply\r\nindebted. JAMES, _Naval History of Great Britain_, 6 vols., edit. 1837;\r\nvols. i.-iii. include from 1793 to 1801, a famous work which is still of\r\nhigh authority on naval engagements and tactics, the size and classes of\r\nships, the number and character of their guns, etc., but it neither\r\nexplains nor criticises strategy. BRENTON, _Naval History of Great\r\nBritain, 1783-1822_, 5 vols., 1823, uncritical and inaccurate, though as\r\nthe work of a naval officer in active service, who had a part in some of\r\nthe events it describes, it has a certain importance. Sir W. L. CLOWES,\r\n_The Royal Navy_, vol. iv., 1899. T. KEPPEL, _Life of Viscount Keppel_,\r\n2 vols., 1842. MUNDY, _Life of Rodney_, 2 vols., 1830. Mr. D. HANNAY,\r\n_Rodney_ (English Men of Action Series), 1891, an admirable little book,\r\nand his edition of the _Letters of Sir S. (Viscount) Hood_ (Navy Records\r\nSoc.), 1895, exhibiting the determining effect of naval failure on the\r\npart of England on the last phase of the war with America. BARROW, _Life\r\nof Earl Howe_, 1838. Mr. J. K. LAUGHTON, _Nelson_ (English Men of Action\r\nSeries), 1895, by an acknowledged master of English naval history, and\r\nhis articles in the _Dict. of National Biography_ on the sea-captains of\r\nthe period. _Logs of the Great Sea Fights, 1794-1805_ (Navy Records\r\nSoc.), vol. i., 1899, in progress, well edited by Rear-Admiral T.\r\nSturges Jackson, a delightful book of first-rate value. References to\r\nthe latest contributions to the subject of Nelson at Naples are given in\r\nthe text. CHEVALIER, _Histoire de la Marine Francaise pendant la Guerre\r\nde l'Independence Americaine_, 1877, _Histoire, etc., sous la premiere\r\nRepublique_, 1886, most valuable works; a third vol., _Hist., etc., sous\r\nle Consulat_. M. le Capitaine DESBRIERE, _Projets de Debarquement_, 2\r\nvols., 1901, a phase of the great war told with all the care and\r\nlucidity which distinguish the best French historical work.\r\n\r\n(10) For European politics during the French revolution the best books\r\nare by HEINRICH VON SYBEL, used here in the French translation,\r\n_Histoire de l'Europe pendant la Revolution Francaise_, 6 vols.,\r\n1869-88, and by M. ALBERT SOREL, _L'Europe et la Revolution Francaise_,\r\n6 vols., 1903, in progress; vol. vi. covers 1800-5, a work distinguished\r\nalike by learning, insight, and literary quality; the great collection\r\nof G. F. VON MARTENS, _Recueil des Traites depuis 1761_, vols. i.-vi.,\r\n1817-29; Comte DE GARDEN, _Histoire des Traites_, vols. iv.-vi.,\r\n1848-87, and F. DE MARTENS, _Recueil des Traites conclus par la Russie_,\r\nvols. ix., x. (_Angleterre_), 1892.\r\n\r\n(11) In Irish history LECKY has generally been followed, supplemented by\r\nPLOWDEN, _History of Ireland to the Union_, 2 vols., 1809; H. GRATTAN,\r\n_Life of Grattan_, 5 vols., 1839; _Correspondence between Pitt and the\r\nDuke of Rutland_, 1781-87, edit. 1890. Earl FITZWILLIAM, _First_ and\r\n_Second Letters to the Earl of Carlisle_, 1795; TONE, _Life of T. W.\r\nTone_, 2 vols., 1826; MADDEN, _United Irishmen_, 2 vols., 2nd edit.,\r\n1858; GORDON, _History of the Rebellion_, 2nd edit., 1803, a trustworthy\r\nand graphic narrative by a protestant clergyman of co. Wexford; _Memoirs\r\nand Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh_ (Lord Londonderry), 12\r\nvols., 1848-85, vols. ii.-iv.; INGRAM, _History of the Irish Union_,\r\n1887, though failing in its hopeless attempt to prove that the union was\r\nnot effected by corrupt means, a book well worth reading; _Cornwallis\r\nCorrespondence_ and some other books already noted.\r\n\r\n(12) For Indian matters:--MILL and WILSON, _History of British India_,\r\n10 vols., 1858, vols. iii.-vi., a standard work; Sir J. F. STEPHEN,\r\n_Story of Nuncomar_, 2 vols., 1885; Mr. G. FORREST, _Selections from\r\nState Papers, India_, 1772-85, 3 vols., 1890, documents of first-rate\r\nimportance, well edited, with good introduction, which, perhaps,\r\nattempts too complete a defence of Hastings; Sir A. LYALL, _Warren\r\nHastings_ (English Men of Action Series), 1902, a thoroughly sound and\r\nwell-considered biography; Mr. S. J. OWEN, _Selections from the\r\nDespatches of Marquess Wellesley_, 1877, with the _Cornwallis\r\nCorrespondence_ already noted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ON ECONOMIC PROGRESS._]\r\n\r\n(13) For the social and economic history in chap, xiii., a general\r\naccount will be found in LECKY, _History_, vol. v., an admirable and\r\ndelightful piece of work; _Social England_, vol. v., 1896, edited by\r\nTRAILL, papers of various merit by various authors; a new edition with\r\nwell-chosen illustrations is now (1904) published; and chapters at the\r\nend of vols. vii. and ix. of the _Pictorial History of England_, edited\r\nby CRAIK and MACFARLANE, 1841, 1843. Manners and customs are described\r\nby Mr. SYDNEY, _England and the English in the Eighteenth Century_, 2\r\nvols., 1891, and by Mr. ASHTON, whose _Old Times_, 1885, is almost\r\nwholly composed of newspaper cuttings and caricatures, and is,\r\ntherefore, so far as it goes, a contemporary authority. Notices of the\r\ngambling and frivolity of a portion of the upper class, some not before\r\nprinted, are given in Sir G. TREVELYAN'S _Early Life of C. J. Fox_ (see\r\nabove). An independent study should include the chronicle in the _Annual\r\nRegister, Walpole's Letters_, JESSE, _George Selwyn and his\r\nContemporaries_, 4 vols., 1843, and _Selwyn's Letters_, edited by Mr.\r\nRoscoe and Miss Clergue, 1899; SMOLLETT, _Humphrey Clinker_, written in\r\n1770; ANSTEY, _New Bath Guide_, \"poetical epistles describing life at\r\nBath\" in 1766; Miss BURNEY, _Evelina_, in 1778, and many other books. A\r\ngood introduction to the literary history of the period is given by Mr.\r\nG. SAINTSBURY, _Short History of English Literature_, 1898. Though the\r\nlate Sir LESLIE STEPHEN in his _English Thought in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury_, 2 vols., 2nd edit., 1881, deals chiefly with the earlier part\r\nof the century, he has much of the highest value, specially in chaps. x.\r\nand xi., on writers of this period; see also his articles on them in the\r\n_Dict. of National Biography_. Church history is carefully treated by\r\nABBEY and OVERTON, _The English Church in the Eighteenth Century_, ed.\r\n1887. For the administration of the criminal law--Major GRIFFITH,\r\n_Chronicles of Newgate_, 2 vols., 1884. For prisons--JOHN HOWARD, _The\r\nState of the Prisons_, 4th edit., 1792. For the police arrangements of\r\nLondon--COLQUHOUN, _Treatise on the Police_, 1795.\r\n\r\nOn economic and industrial history the latest and best authority is Dr.\r\nCUNNINGHAM, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce, Modern Times_,\r\npts. i. and ii., 2 vols., 1903. Other books used are CRAIK, in\r\n_Pictorial History_ as above, republished in his _History of British\r\nCommerce_, 1844; MACPHERSON, _Annals of Commerce_, 4 vols., 1805;\r\nMCCULLOCH, edition of ADAM SMITH, _Wealth of Nations_, 1863; ROGERS,\r\n_Six Centuries of Work and Wages_, 2 vols., 1884, and his _Industrial\r\nand Commercial History of England_, lectures, 2 vols., 1898, and WARNER,\r\n_Landmarks in English Industrial History_, 1899, a useful and\r\nwell-arranged little book. For the cotton manufacture--Sir E. BAINES,\r\n_History of the Cotton Manufacture_, 1836. With reference to agriculture\r\nand the poor--A. YOUNG, _Six Weeks' Tour in the Southern Counties_,\r\n1769, and _Tour through the North_, 4 vols., 1770, present the condition\r\nof agriculture at the time, with lists of wages and the expenses of the\r\nlabouring class; Rev. J. HOWLETT, pamphlets on the _Influence of\r\nEnclosures_, 1786, and the _Causes of the Increase of the Poor_, 1786;\r\nMr. R. E. PROTHERO, _Pioneers and Progress of English Farming_, 1888, an\r\nexcellent account; Sir G. A. NICHOLLS, _History of the English Poor\r\nLaw_, 2 vols., 1898, and Mr. and Mrs. S. WEBB, _History of Trades\r\nUnionism_, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Asterism]: Dr. A. von Ruville's important and masterly work, _William\r\nPitt, Graf von Chatham_, 3 vols., Stuttgart and Berlin, 1905, appeared\r\nwhile this book was in the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n            ADMINISTRATIONS OF GREAT BRITAIN, 1760-1801.[318]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   1.
