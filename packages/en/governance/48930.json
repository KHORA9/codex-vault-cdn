BRANCH’S ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n                          STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n       In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n             States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Horsewell was a poor boy, and had duck legs. My brother William\r\nwas taller and older than John, and had a new suit of clothes, with\r\nwhich I clad John from head to foot. Bill’s hat and boots were too\r\nlarge for John, and his coat on John nearly grazed the ground. I put\r\non my Sunday suit, and off we went to Boston, forty miles distant. We\r\nquarrelled on the road, in a deep wood, and I demanded John to take\r\noff Bill’s clothes, at which he called me hard names, and I left him,\r\nand directed my steps towards Providence, leaving him reclining on\r\nthe embankment of the forest road. I wandered half a mile at a quick\r\nand revengeful pace; but as twilight was approaching, and I heard the\r\nbark of a dog, with lungs of thunder, I became alarmed, and hurried\r\nback to John, and craved his pardon, and we lingered until the stage\r\narrived, when we took passage for Boston, reaching the Marlboro’ Hotel\r\nat midnight. Mr. Barker was the host, and, on our inquiry for lamps\r\nto retire, he exclaimed: “Who are you, and whence came you?” John was\r\ndisconcerted, but I was cool, and replied: “Our names are Branch and\r\nHorsewell, and we are from Providence.” “Did you visit Boston with the\r\npermission of your father and mother?” “No, sir.” “You ran away, then?”\r\n“No, sir; we walked away.” “What can you do in Boston in your clouts?”\r\n“Learn a trade, sir.” “Have you any money?” “Forty cents, sir.” “Bob:\r\nTake these brats to your room, and make a bunk on the floor, and lock\r\nthe door, and watch their movements closely until morning, when I will\r\nput them in the poor house or county jail.” And off we tramped to bed,\r\nup four flights of stairs, and were locked in until Bob came to bed,\r\nwhen we snored terribly, pretending to be in a doze so profound, that\r\na cannon could not arouse us. John cried all night, and at daylight\r\nwe crawled softly from our hard nests, while Bob was asleep, and\r\nsoftly turned the key, and descended the stairs in our stockings, and\r\nfled for our lives. We went to the market, and got a cheap breakfast,\r\nand then sought the theatre, where we saw Mac Cready announced as\r\n“Hamlet.” We ardently desired to go, but had not sufficient money;\r\nand away we trudge to Brattle street, and exchange our new clothes\r\nfor worthless rags, with five dollars besides. We then return to the\r\ntheatre, and linger on its steps until the performance begins, when we\r\npurchase tickets, and rush, with about forty negroes, up stairs into\r\nthe gallery, like a gang of maniacs, (so wild was our common joy,)\r\nwhere we witness a vast plain of woolly heads that resemble the Black\r\nSea. The heat was intense, and we perspired like cotton slaves, and\r\nthe stench was as intolerable as cholera malaria. During the day, we\r\nengaged lodgings with a little colored barber, opposite the theatre,\r\nfor nine-pence each a night. At the close of the performance we thumped\r\na long period before he let us in, and then we found him partially\r\nintoxicated. In the morning, we strolled on the Common, and John became\r\nhomesick, and besought me to return to Providence; and he cried and\r\nimplored so hard, that I yielded; and while engaging our passage, a\r\nyoung man named James Baker recognised us, and desired me to remain in\r\nBoston under his protection, to which I assented, but John departed\r\nfor Providence. I went to board with Jim Baker in Theatre Alley, with\r\nMrs. Charnock, a superannuated actress, and afterwards at the Sun\r\nTavern and other places, for which we did not pay our board, and walked\r\nto Salem, where I wrote to father for money, which he sent me, and I\r\nreturned to Providence. He received me with intense affection, and I\r\nwept with commingled joy and sorrow at my return, and his anguish at my\r\ndishonorable absence. At about ten years old, John Horsewell and myself\r\nstole some pigeons from Dexter Spencer’s barn, and we were caught with\r\nthem in our hats. Father took my hand, and led me to the wharf, where\r\nships could float, and suspended me over the water, until I had a\r\nslight fit, when he carried me home. It was baking day, and aunt Lucy\r\nwas very angry because he did not drown me, and in her wrath, while\r\nhe was absent, she took out the pies and brown bread, and put me in\r\nthe oven head foremost, and nearly baked me. A few seconds more in the\r\noven, and I would have smothered. I told father when he came to dinner,\r\nand he boxed Aunt Lucy’s ears severely, and demanded her to instantly\r\nsurrender the dress and bonnet he gave her the day previous. But she\r\ncried so hard, and wrung her hands so piteously, that he soon restored\r\nthem, lest she would have cramps in the stomach, with which she was\r\noften dangerously afflicted, through her excessive fondness for cheese\r\nand hard-shell clams, of which she often ate until she could scarcely\r\nbreathe. A month later, I stole some peaches and currents from Captain\r\nProuds’ garden, and old junk and iron from the ship yards. Father was\r\na Justice of the Peace, and took me to jail, and put me in a cell;\r\nbut I screamed so fearfully, that he restored me to liberty in about\r\nfive minutes; and when I emerged from the dungeon, I sprang upon his\r\nbosom, and kissed him as tenderly as a cow laps her calf, and I also\r\nkissed the turnkey, whose keys terribly scared me. I soon went to a\r\ncountry boarding school, and terrified the farmers for miles around,\r\nwho petitioned father to come after me, who visited the unsophisticated\r\ncountrymen, and strove to tranquilise their nerves with the assurance\r\nthat I would not contaminate their children, nor desolate their fields\r\nand orchards, and that it was the crows and not me that pilfered their\r\nearly crops of fruits and vegetation. But they shook their heads, and\r\nbesought him to restore the wonted quiet and confidence of the parish,\r\nby my immediate departure for some distant region. Father succumbed,\r\nand we left for Providence, where I became the very youthful clerk\r\nof Norman White, who is now an extensive type and paper merchant in\r\nBeekman street, with whom I remained until I left for New York with Jim\r\nBaker in the steamer Washington, Captain Bunker, concealing ourselves\r\nin the water closets until the boat passed Newport, when we appeared\r\non deck, and strutted as boldly and proudly as Robert Macaire and his\r\ncompanion. But the Captain soon discovered us to be impostors, and made\r\nus pass pine wood to the firemen for our passage. Jim was older and\r\nstronger than me, and the Captain and first mate made him work like a\r\nslave; but I was seasick, and vomited dreadfully all over the deck, and\r\nthe firemen, and passengers; and as the Captain slowly passed me, I\r\nbelched a copious volley of the most bitter bile plumply in his face,\r\nfor which he severely shook me, and made me express my sorrow for the\r\ndire calamity and apparent insult, and drove me down below, where I\r\nimplored the Cook to throw me overboard, and relieve me from my deathly\r\nsickness. The nigger Cook laughed uproariously over my misfortunes, and\r\ndeclined my request, and brought me a stew composed of pork, molasses,\r\nand onions, for my dinner; and, as I smelt, and inhaled, and gazed\r\nupon the nauseous dish, I let fly a torrent of bile into the darkey’s\r\nface, who run for his life, and molested me no more during the voyage,\r\nand I never saw Sambo again. We arrived in New York, at Fulton market,\r\nand went to Holts’ Eating House, and ate heartily, and Jim Baker went\r\nin pursuit of work as a segar maker, and I tagged on behind. He got\r\nemployment, and we boarded in Fulton street, near Broadway. I soon\r\ngot a situation as bar keeper, with Mr. Saunders, in Laurens street,\r\nnext to the theatre, and soon afterwards went a few doors above, in\r\nthe basement, as bartender for Mr. Gilman. I then became a waiter in a\r\nNew York and Albany steamboat, and afterwards in a Hartford steamer.\r\nI then went to an Intelligence office (whoso proprietor strove to\r\ncheat me), and for 50 cents got a situation with Wm. Chapman, No. 60\r\nPine street, at $2 a week, and boarded in Water street, near Beekman.\r\nWm. H. Stansbury was Mr. Chapman’s book-keeper, who left soon after\r\nI came, and went with James Brooks, of the “_New York Express_,” as\r\nbook-keeper, where he is now. This was in 1826. My duties consisted\r\nin helping William Chapman softly draw his coat over his rheumatic\r\nshoulders, and going to the Post Office, and copying letters. I told\r\nMr. Chapman that I had to pay two dollars a week for board, and that\r\nhe must increase my salary, or I could not remain. He said that he\r\ncould get a boy for less than two dollars a week, and I left him, and\r\ngot a place with two brothers, named Morton, in Front street, for two\r\ndollars and twenty-five cents a week. While passing the sailor hat\r\nstore of Mr. Leary, Mr. Leary’s mother called me into the store, and\r\nsaid: “Little boy, if you will take this bottle, and go to the grocery\r\nand get me some gin, I will give you some pennies.” When I returned\r\nwith the gin, she asked me if I would like to be a clerk for Mr. Leary.\r\nI said that I would come for my board and clothes. She told me to call\r\nin the evening and arrange the compensation with Mr. Leary, who would\r\nthen be in the store. I did so, and on the following day I told the\r\nMessrs. Morton that I must leave them, as two dollars and twenty-five\r\ncents a week could not buy my food and clothes, and pay for washing my\r\ntwo shirts and two pairs of stockings. Mr. Leary, his wife, mother,\r\nchildren, and myself, were packed like pork in two small rooms in the\r\nrear of the store, which were used as kitchens, bed-rooms, parlors,\r\nwash-rooms and everything else, which rendered the atmosphere slightly\r\ndense and foggy, and perhaps impure, and in the night we often had\r\nskull collisions, and tumbled over each other, which strongly resembled\r\na rough and tumble cabin scene in a terrific storm. I might have\r\nendured all this, but to make fires, open store, sell hats to drunken\r\nsailors, run errands, and take care of squalling children, so taxed\r\nmy patience, and wasted my pale and naturally delicate form, that I\r\nresolved to leave instanter, and, with the Pilgrim’s heavy burden, away\r\nI flew in pursuit of employment. Mr. Leary now keeps a hat store in the\r\nAstor House, whose boys are wealthy merchants in Exchange Place, whom\r\nI often remind of the days when I bore them in my arms, and spanked\r\nthem when they squalled. From Leary’s I went to the Harpers in Cliff\r\nstreet, and was placed in the pressing and folding room, in the upper\r\nstory. I boarded with Fletcher (the youngest of the Harpers) in Batavia\r\nstreet, between James and Roosevelt. The firm then consisted of John,\r\nJames, and Wesley Harper. Fletcher was the foreman of the composing\r\nroom, (where I was ultimately placed), who corrected my earliest errors\r\nin the printer’s stick—and a precious job he had of it—consuming more\r\nof his valuable time than my composition was worth. Fletcher was a\r\nfireman, and recently married, and rather wild, and had two children,\r\none of whom was the partner of Raymond, Wesley and Jones, of the\r\n“_New York Daily Times_,” at the origin of that Journal, whom I often\r\nfondled in my arms in his infancy, who was a very pretty child, though\r\nrather lively for one so extremely young, whose extraordinary vivacity\r\nI attributed to worms. Wesley Harper was incomparably modest and\r\nsusceptible in those days, and visited and married a lady residing with\r\nFletcher, who was connected with his wife. While they were courting up\r\nstairs, the servant girl, myself, and other apprentices often annoyed\r\nthem with our funny tricks; but Wesley and Fletcher did not dare\r\ncomplain of us to John and James Harper, as the courtship of Wesley was\r\nwithout the knowledge of the elder Harpers. The servant of Fletcher\r\nimparted to us this precious secret, and we long teased the timid\r\nlovers with impunity, in which the mischievous servant participated\r\nwith great hilarity.\r\n\r\n (To be continued to the mournful eve of our last gasp)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTEN!—On Saturday last we arose with the glorious sun, and went\r\nto our printing office, and found the printer’s devil asleep in his\r\ndingy bunk. We applied a bodkin, and he sprang at us like a tiger.\r\nWe grappled, and discovering that he had an Editorial Alligator by\r\nthe throat, he released his grasp. We then banged the gong, and the\r\nprinters appeared, like the imps in Robert the Devil, from the infernal\r\nregions. We then placed our leviathan form on the press, and lit\r\nthe faggots, and puff, puff, went the machinery, like the drums and\r\ntrumpets in Musard’s Express Train Gallop. We filled our carpet bag\r\nwith Alligators, and flew like a whirlwind to the wholesale newspaper\r\nmerchants in Beekman, Nassau, and Ann streets, where we found a plumed\r\nbattalion awaiting the advent of the Alligator. The wholesalers, and\r\nretailers, and newsboys approached us in platoons, and clasped our\r\nfervent hands until they squeezed them into icicles, and we cried for\r\nquarter, and returned to our printing office, for another carpet bag of\r\nAlligators, which we sold on our way to Ann street, and returned again,\r\nand again, and yet again, for Alligators, until the weary sun retired\r\nto his downy bed in the bleak peach and potato fields of the Jerseys.\r\nOur printing office was besieged throughout the day, for Alligators,\r\nand on our return from Ann street the second time, we found our office\r\nstairs so thronged with applicants for Alligators, that we had to\r\nmeander a dark alley, and ascend a ladder, and enter our office through\r\na window. During the day, several bloody collisions transpired on the\r\nstairs, between the newsboys, in their struggles for the Alligators, as\r\nthey emanated from our electric presses; and in one of the desperate\r\nconflicts, the Police were summoned to preserve the public peace.\r\nAnd, altogether it was a most laborious and exciting day for us, and\r\nat early twilight we were weary and worn, and retired soon after\r\nthe curfew strains expired on the evening air. But we had an awful\r\nnightmare, in which we soliloquised in tones so stentorian, (about\r\nnewsboys and Alligators,) as to arouse and terrify a venerable nervous\r\ngentleman in the next apartment, who thought we were either fighting or\r\ndying, and he rapped against the wall with his poker until he awoke us.\r\nWhile on the eve of our emergence from the nightmare, we dreamed that\r\na colossus spider was devouring our proboscis, at which we levelled a\r\nHyer blow,\r\n\r\n  When pure blood oozed from our nose,\r\n  Like water from Sikesy’s hose,\r\n\r\nwhich aroused us, and we darted into the bath room, and applied the\r\nhealing Croton without effect, and had to dam our nostrils with\r\nputty, which checked the copious effusion of blood, but which made us\r\ntalk in nosy and twangy accents. In about an hour, the putty became\r\nthoroughly saturated and drippy, and we had to make fresh applications,\r\nand ultimately the putty dam was victorious. But our eyes are rather\r\ncrimson, and we have fearful rumbling sounds in our ears, resembling\r\ndistant thunder, and the bugle in the mountains, and we fear our\r\nnostrils are in a state of inundation, and that our blood will effect\r\na passage through our eyes or ears, and rush wildly into the open air.\r\nBut we checked the blood, and leaped into our couch, and off we went,\r\nlike a patriotic rocket, into a slumber like that of the pure and sweet\r\nAmena, in the chamber of Rudolpho, and was no farther molested with\r\nhorrible dreams of the newsboys and Alligators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFra Diavolo and his Italian Brigands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree hundred and sixteen thousand dollars have been drawn from the\r\nMunicipal Treasury, for printing the worthless Records of the County\r\nClerk’s office, and nearly as much for the Register’s Records. Who\r\ngot the $550,000 for which there is nothing valuable to show? Can the\r\nsmooth, and glossy, and sweetly-scented Connolly, or Wetmore, (or\r\nBusteed and his kinsman, Doane,) or Nathan, or Nelson tell us? Of\r\ncourse they can, as they were the corrupt disbursers of this prodigious\r\nplunder. Speak, then, ye infernal robbers of the toiling millions,\r\nwhom ye bamboozle, and starve, and disease, and jam, and ram, and\r\nsmother in cellars and attics and tenement houses, and whose devoted\r\nwives and virgin daughters you drive unto prostitution for food and\r\nrent and medicine and apparel. You consummate these pernicious wrongs\r\nand oppressions through your Janus and Judas professions of democracy,\r\nwhich no more resemble Jefferson’s, Madison’s, Calhoun’s and Jackson’s\r\npolitical creed, than your sleek hair, and fancy apparel, and thievish\r\npropensities resemble the simple garb and integrity of those democratic\r\nlegions, whose votes you literally steal through your honied political\r\nheresies, and the lavish expenditure of the very money you steal from\r\nthe people, through such jobs as the Record printing. With fast horses,\r\nwines, and costly gluttony, and daubed all over with pomatum, you revel\r\nhigh in your dazzling Persian Pavilions, whose construction and gilded\r\nfurniture, and luscious viands, are stolen directly from the honorable\r\nand deluded millions. These are truths, and we will proclaim them from\r\nthe steeples of the metropolis, and strive to arouse a people who\r\nslumber on the confines of volcanoes, while thieves, and rapes, and\r\nincendiaries, and midnight assassins are softly crawling towards their\r\nthroats. Your perjured alienage we might extenuate, but your robbery\r\nof the honest and laborious masses we will expose and combat, if we\r\nrot in the dungeons of Blackwell’s or Sing Sing. The purest editors of\r\nthis thievish age are too pliable, and politic, and mercenary for the\r\npublic welfare; but we will dissect your robbery, if we are crucified\r\nwith spikes, and our limbs are chopped and hacked with a butcher’s\r\naxe, and our flesh, blood, bones and marrow burned to cinders, and our\r\nashes cast upon the whirlwind for annihilation. The axe and faggot we\r\ndefy. God only do we fear. So, come on, ye teeming caverns of infernal\r\nthieves, and seize, and incarcerate, and butcher, and strive to\r\nannihilate our mortal scabbard, but you shall not have the soul, which\r\nwill elude your wicked and revengeful grasp, and have eternal succor\r\nin the realms of purity and bliss, if, in its mortal pilgrimage, it be\r\ntrue to God and his pilfered, oppressed, and misanthropic children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the genial, affable, and generous Joseph Gales, of the National\r\nIntelligencer, James Watson Webb is the senior editor of our country,\r\nand James Gordon Bennett is close at his heels, whose venerable and\r\nmajestic forms will soon descend the dismal steps of the tomb, and\r\ntheir extraordinary souls appear in the awful presence of a Judge,\r\nfrom whom there is no appeal. Solemn thought! and almost paralysing\r\nin its contemplation. Webb was born in America, and Bennett on the\r\nmountains of Scotland, where one of his parents survives, to enjoy the\r\nsuccess and protection of her faithful son. With James Watson Webb we\r\nnever exchanged a word, which we can scarcely realise in view of our\r\nintimate relations, for twenty years, with other metropolitan editors.\r\nBut with James Gordon Bennett we have had the closest relations, and we\r\nproclaim, with no ordinary emotions of pleasure, that he has treated\r\nus more like a brother than a stranger. In our memorable mnemotechnic\r\ncontroversy with Professor Francis Fauvel Gouraud, in 1843, when almost\r\nevery editor in America was arrayed against us, and eternal ruin seemed\r\ninevitable, James Gordon Bennett came to our rescue, and, with George\r\nW. Kendall, of the New Orleans Picayune, George D. Prentice, of the\r\nLouisville Journal, and Mrs. Walters, of the Boston Transcript, we were\r\nsublimely victorious in that scholastic disputation. In consideration\r\nof his magnanimous conduct, we wrote to the _Herald_ about one hundred\r\ncolumns from Panama and California, when the civilized world was\r\nrocked, to its profoundest basis, with the dazzling gold discoveries,\r\nand on our return, he gave us money, and ever cheered us in our\r\nillness and penury. When we wrote the inflammatory Report of the noble\r\nAlfred Carson, against the Common Council of 1850, we gave it to Mr.\r\nBennett, to the exclusion of the other editors, because he had been\r\ntrue in our adversity, when the hands of all mankind seemed uplifted\r\nto annihilate our pale and feeble frame. We had boarded with Horace\r\nGreeley, for seven years, at the Graham House, in Barclay street,\r\nand all our relations had been of the most friendly character; and\r\nyet we deemed it our sacred duty to send our Pilgrim letters to Mr.\r\nBennett, and also give him Carson’s famous Report, to the exclusion\r\nof Greeley, because Bennett’s fidelity was next to our Father’s.\r\nGreeley was a formidable candidate for the Mayoralty, when Carson’s\r\nReport appeared, and if we had given it to him instead of Bennett, he\r\nwould have been the successor of Mayor Woodhull. But in giving it to\r\nBennett for publication one day in advance of Greeley, so exasperated\r\nthe latter against Carson and ourself, that he attacked the Report\r\nlike a ferocious bull dog, and slew himself, whose name was hardly\r\nwhispered in the Mayoralty Convention that soon followed. Alderman\r\nMorgan Morgans, (President of the Board of Aldermen,) Alderman Robert\r\nH. Hawes, Alderman George H. Franklin, and Mayor Woodhull himself were\r\nalso candidates. But as they were all severely denounced in Carson’s\r\nReport, for discharging culprits without examination or trial, and\r\nfor other offences common to Aldermen in those days, they were all\r\nrejected by the Convention, when the oily Ambrose C. Kingsland entered\r\nthe arena, and was nominated and easily elected, which proved to be\r\nthe saddest municipal calamity of that period, as he was in collusion\r\nthroughout his term with official scoundrels, and made more money than\r\nany Mayor who preceded him, as one of our Aldermanic pupils often\r\nassured us; and if Kingsland will publicly deny our accusations, we\r\nwill adduce our informant’s name, and paralyse him. And to be briefly\r\nexplicit, our informant was connected with Kingsland and Draper’s\r\noperations to rob the city of the Gansevoort property. Kingsland’s\r\nappointment of Matsell as Chief of Police partially corroborates the\r\nassertion of the Alderman who imparted his precious information.\r\nKingsland’s appointment of Matsell was effected thus: According to his\r\ncustom, with Mayors elect, Matsell invited Kingsland to a ride into\r\nthe Metropolitan suburbs, on the morning after his election, and in\r\npassing a gaudy edifice, the Brandon Chieftain halted and exclaimed:\r\n“Kingsland, my boy, is not that a fascinating mansion?” Kingsland\r\ncrimsoned, and gazed rapiers and scabbards, and in baffled accents,\r\nmildly ejaculated in the expressive language of Jemmy Twitcher: “Vell,\r\nvot of it?” “O, nothing,—only I thought I would inquire how you\r\nenjoyed yourself in its rainbow halls on Friday evening last. And,\r\nby the way, how about the appointment of Chief of Police? Have you\r\nresolved whom to appoint?” “Certainly I have. You well know my ancient\r\nlove for you, and that you are my choice for Chief, beyond any being\r\nliving or dead. I was elected to eject you, but I shan’t do it, my boy.\r\n‘Thou art the man!’ Ha, ha, ha! Give us your hand, old boy. Ha, ha, ha!\r\nA very fine day, ain’t it Matsell?” “Kingsland, you have really got a\r\nmagnificent Palace in the Fifth Avenue, but I think your front parlor\r\nrequires a five thousand dollar clock, to render it thoroughly gorgeous\r\nand enchanting.” “Chief, what in the name of mud are you driving at?”\r\n“I am driving for my life to Burnham’s, for his choicest brandy and Ice\r\nCream.”\r\n\r\nMore delicious Ice Cream next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Country’s Ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seed of wide-spread corruption is culminating here, at Albany, and\r\nWashington, with the velocity of light, (which is about two hundred\r\nthousand miles per second,) which may rend the Union to fragments\r\nduring the present generation. And the present leaders of parties\r\nwill be the immediate cause of our country’s downfall, through their\r\nsly winks and blinks at the robbers of their respective parties, to\r\nseize the public booty to elect their municipal, State, and national\r\nofficers. Horace Greeley, with all his professions of purity, justice\r\nand humanity, will shield an anti-slavery thief at every peril of\r\nhis conscience, and scourge the thieves of all other parties like\r\nTacitus, or Diogenes, and so will the leaders of the American and\r\nDemocratic parties. It is not the struggle for the boundaries of\r\nslavery and freedom that will rend this Union to atoms, but the\r\nmiserable, thievish, aspiring, and traffic politicians who use the\r\nNegro and Satan, to seize the public treasure and official honors. It\r\nis the ungodly grab of lazy men for gilded booty, to enable them to\r\nrevel in indolence, and control the elections and magic wires of all\r\nthe parties, that will consummate our dissolution and eternal ruin.\r\nAnd Greeley and Bryant know this, and so does that puritannical,\r\nmercenary, penurious, white handkerchief’d, and stiff-necked old\r\nPresbyterian, Gerard Hallock, of the Journal of Commerce, and those\r\nthieves of thieves, and Catalinian conspirators, and overshadowing\r\nplunderers, Simeon Draper and Thurlow Weed, whom God, or man, or fiend\r\nshould drive to the wilderness, or smite from the face of the earth,\r\nand, if possible, from its profoundest bowels. For their stabs at the\r\nheart of our free institutions, and their pernicious example to the\r\nyouth of this generation, they should be hurled from the summit of the\r\nRocky mountains. There is no honor or patriotism in these demons. If\r\nthere were, they would rally like our Fathers for the preservation of\r\nour glorious Union, and the Municipal, State and National Treasuries,\r\nwhose plunder they counsel and shield in the infamous persons of their\r\npolitical confederates, and share their spoils in darkness, with only\r\nthe Devil present, but the Great Invisible in the awful distance, whose\r\nretribution will be terrible when it comes, beyond the grave; and worms\r\nmay partially devour their vile carcases, before they die, as with\r\nBiddle and Nero, and Caliglula. All leaders of parties are plunderers,\r\nand thus directly advocate the subversion of our liberties and the\r\npublic dishonor. God, alone, from the Revolution to the present hour,\r\nhas shielded the Americans from foreign and domestic adversaries,\r\nwith his beneficent arms expanded over our fertile vales, and fields,\r\nand plains, and forests, and noble mountains, and has rescued us from\r\nthe Burrs and Arnolds, and Goths and Vandals, who strive to paralise\r\nour progress in a pure and sacred civilization. But our disunion and\r\nsubversion are as inevitable as the advent of the morning sun, unless\r\nsome Washington, or Cincinnatus, or Brutus the First come forth, and\r\nstab the incarnate devils down, and trample their worthless bodies in\r\nthe dust. Thieves, rapes, incendiaries, assassins, and traitors teem\r\nlike the Egyptian locusts throughout our borders, and the odious vices,\r\nand bloody strife, and crumbling ruins, and all the horrors and havoc\r\nand universal chaos of the Roman Empire, and other ancient States,\r\nwill be our awful doom, unless the wisdom, and virtue, and firmness of\r\nour country rally in the Forum, and impart the principles of integrity\r\nand patriotism to the people, and immolate the leading scoundrels and\r\ntraitors of the age. Thus only can we avert the overshadowing evils\r\nthat flit like midnight spectres through every street and habitation,\r\nand will soon spread through every meritorious fireside. And thus only\r\ncan we avert the execrations of our posterity, for being recreant to\r\nthe Roman Fathers of the Revolution, and for not resisting with our\r\nlives, the barbarians of the present generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICE AND MODEST.—The son and son-in-law of Peter Cooper as Mayor and\r\nStreet Commissioner of the largest city of the Western Hemisphere,\r\nworth half a million per annum.\r\n\r\n  Aminidab Sleek,\r\n  (Without a shriek\r\n  For freedom,\r\n  Or bleed ’em,\r\n  Or Sodom,\r\n  Or Gotham,)\r\n  Could make that sum at least,\r\n  And for life have a feast.\r\n  The office-holding Coopers\r\n  Are worse than the Hoopers,\r\n  So fat grow they,\r\n  On pap all day,\r\n  Throughout the year,\r\n  Which seems so queer,\r\n  For Reformers,\r\n  Or Performers,\r\n  Which was always so,\r\n  In this vale of dough:\r\n  Our eyes are wo!\r\n  O! O!! O!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDev’l-in a Bakery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawes, the New York baker, says: “Branch, do you know Charley Devlin?”\r\n“Yes.” “Well, Branch, I was a baker apprentice with him, and also a\r\njourneyman. He was burned and floated out of his bakery in the Fourth\r\nWard some years since, and he desired to bake for his customers in my\r\noven until his own was repaired. I, of course, consented. Subsequently,\r\nhe became a primary politician, and for several years past has besought\r\nme to sell my bakery, and become a contractor. I hesitated for a long\r\nperiod, but last year, (finding that he had acquired wealth very fast,)\r\nI resolved to dispose of my bakery, and join him as a contractor.\r\nA neighbor learned my purpose, who assured me that, to his sorrow,\r\nin early life he was a politician, and that if I joined Devlin as a\r\ncontractor, I would be compelled to take at least three false oaths a\r\nday throughout the year, (for which people are sent to States Prison\r\nten years, and forever lose their suffrage,) which so alarmed me,\r\nthat I abandoned my intention and narrowly escaped the portals of a\r\ndungeon, and the loss of my patronage as a baker, and my reputation\r\nas an honorable man, for which I devoutly thank the Great Disposer of\r\nEvents.” We congratulated our honest friend Hawes, and warned him to\r\nbeware of the Dev’l-in a bakery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAPPY FAMILY.—How cunning for Peter Cooper and Mayor Tiemann to\r\nsend Hopeful to the Democratic General Committee, and beat Elijah F.\r\nPurdy by one vote for Chairman; and then for Daniel and Edward (the\r\nsons of Peter) to turn up Mayor and Street Commissioner. It is the more\r\ncunning, as Peter Cooper and Daniel F. Tiemann have held Municipal\r\noffices since 1828, and now, with Hopeful, have two of the most\r\nlucrative and honorable offices in America. In view of all this, Peter\r\ncan well afford to give two or three upper stories of a Bowery edifice\r\nto the city for educational purposes, without feeling it very keenly.\r\nBesides, the immortality of the gift is of some moment. Verily, the\r\nTiemanns and Coopers should be a very Happy Family; and if Death do not\r\nconfuse and thwart their successful and extraordinary tactics, as with\r\npoor Joseph S. Taylor, (who, with all his faults, had a heart as big\r\nas a mountain,) they will doubtless acquire sufficient from the public\r\nteats, which they have sucked so long, to render them comfortable in\r\ntheir superannuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Pale Students, and Romantic Virgins.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1780, Washington defrayed the educational expenses of a youth, who\r\nwas an immediate descendent of Pocahontas, and procured his passage\r\nto Scotland, where he became a student in its noble highlands. In his\r\nclass were two youths, whom he loved with enthusiastic fondness. One\r\nwas from Damascus, and the other from the Oriental Empire, who was\r\nborn beneath the native village skies of Confucius, to whom he traced\r\nhis blood. On the eve of graduation, and just prior to their departure\r\nfor the remotest portions of the globe, they fondly rambled in the\r\nwoods and groves, where they oft had wandered, and ascended majestic\r\nmountains, on whose celestial peaks, (with the pale moon in her zenith\r\nroaming,) they sung these pensive lines, in their favorite Alpine\r\nbowers:\r\n\r\n  When shall we three meet again?\r\n  When shall we three meet again?\r\n  Oft shall glowing hope expire;\r\n  Oft shall wearied love retire;\r\n  Oft shall death and sorrow reign,\r\n  Ere we three do meet again.\r\n\r\n  Though in distant lands we sigh,\r\n  Parched beneath a hostile sky;\r\n  Though the deep between us rolls,\r\n  Friendship shall unite our souls;\r\n  Long may this loved bower remain;\r\n  Here may we three meet again.\r\n\r\n  When the dreams of life have fled;\r\n  When its wasted lamp is dead;\r\n  When in cold oblivion’s shade,\r\n  Beauty, wealth and power are laid;\r\n  Where immortal spirits reign,\r\n  There may we three meet again.\r\n\r\nThey soon departed for their respective countries, and never met again!\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\n  “The human heart, like the muffled drum,\r\n  Is ever beating funeral marches to the grave!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED—Temperate, energetic, and impulsive young men to canvass the\r\ncity for the Alligator, who can be carriers on those routes where they\r\nobtain subscribers. There are thousands of masters and misses, and\r\nfathers and mothers, and grandfathers and grandmothers who will take\r\nthe Alligator. So, young men, off with your coats, and fly through the\r\ncity like a tornado, for subscribers to the Alligator. And first visit\r\nthe Astor, Saint Nicholas, Metropolitan, Lafarge, Everett, and other\r\nsplendid Restaurants and Oyster Saloons, not one of whose proprietors\r\nwill refuse the Alligator. But if they should, just let us know, and\r\nwe may, in our wrath, blight their custom with our fatal jaw. And\r\nvisit the Reverend Doctors Potts and Taylor, and see Brown, the fancy\r\nSexton, and ask the loan of his magic whistle, which will guide you to\r\nvictory like a wand of enchantment. If Potts and Taylor salute you like\r\nDiogenes, and Brown declines his festive and mausoleum whistle, we may\r\nhaunt them with a peep through their private windows on the first dark\r\nand boisterous midnight. So, boys, look aloft, and arouse yourselves,\r\nand select your own routes without our consultation, until you desire\r\nour Alligators to serve your ecstatic patrons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following was written, in 1854, by Stephen H. Branch, for Ald.\r\nOrison Blunt, then Alderman of the Third Ward, but is now Supervisor\r\nfrom the Fifteenth Ward:\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert Creighton: Sir: I am authorized by the Corporation of\r\nthe City of New York to extend to you the Freedom of the City, together\r\nwith a gold box, as a testimonial of their regard for you. I might\r\nlinger on the thrilling incidents connected with your fidelity to\r\nsuffering humanity, from the moment you discovered the San Francisco,\r\nuntil you rescued from a watery grave, more than 200 distracted beings.\r\nI might touchingly allude to your tears from day to day, as witnessed\r\nby your sailors, because you could not sooner relieve the unfortunate.\r\nI might speak of the fearful responsibility you assumed in violating\r\nthe insurance of your ship and valuable cargo, by deviating from your\r\nspecific course; of your fearful perils amid the howling tempest; of\r\nthe four inch stream of water pouring in upon you, which caused both\r\npumps to be constantly wrought before you discovered the wreck; of\r\nthe disadvantages of four hundred tons of iron, and large quantities\r\nof merchandise, in a ship of only seven hundred tons burthen; of\r\nthe loss of every sail before you saw the wreck, save your foresail\r\nand mainsail. I might dwell on these historical truths, and on your\r\naffectionate regard for the rescued, but I forbear. All this, and even\r\nmore, is on every tongue, and uttered around every fireside, and cannot\r\nbe glorified by me. The contemplation of the good you have effected\r\nwill ever be a delightful solace to you, and your humanity will be a\r\nprecious inheritance to your consanguinity. The wives and children of\r\nthose whose lives you have preserved will ever love you, and transmit\r\nyour name to their farthest posterity. The mariners of every ocean\r\nwill strive to imitate your meritorious example. The noble youth of\r\nour country will read of your heroic deeds, and resolve to emulate\r\nyour manly virtues. Little children already lisp your name in terms\r\nof praise. Tears of gratitude are freely shed for you by either sex,\r\nand fervent prayers go up to Heaven from the habitations of all this\r\nland, that your valuable life may be long preserved, and that health,\r\nhappiness, and prosperity may ever be your lot. And your name will be\r\nrevered by coming generations, when every being who beholds the sun of\r\nthis day, shall be a tenant of the tomb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvent Record—One dollar a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Matsell was born in Brandon, England, and weighed 15 pounds\r\nat birth, and won the first premium at the Brandon Baby Show. Robert\r\nDale Owen visited Brandon on the day after his birth, and gave him some\r\nsugar plums and a silver porringer.\r\n\r\nRichard B. Connolly was born in Bandon, Ireland, (R., for Rogue, being\r\nthe only difference between Matsell and Connolly’s birthplace), 20\r\nmiles west of Cork, and will leave with his parents for Independence\r\nHall, Philadelphia, where he will be naturalized. Richard is a handsome\r\nand promising child, and opened his expressive eyes and sweetly\r\nsmiled, and said Mum and Pap when two days old, when his astounded Mum\r\ndropped him into the lap of Bridget, and screamed and swooned and fell\r\nand rose with dishevelled hair and projected tongue and frothy mouth\r\nand distended nostrils and run into the neighbors, with Pap after her\r\nwith gigantic strides. Three days after birth, little Dick said\r\n\r\n  Slippery-\r\n  Dicery,\r\n  Hickory-\r\n  Trickery,\r\n\r\nwhen his confounded Mum scampered to the Fortune Teller, and Pap to the\r\nPhysician for worm seed, and to the Nurse of the Infant Lunatic Asylum,\r\nfor a strait-jacket for the little scamp, when the medicine and jacket\r\nsoothed him into a gentle slumber, with Mum and Pap slowly expiring on\r\nhis precocious lips.\r\n\r\n  And as he lay,\r\n  All the lone day,\r\n  In a cradle,\r\n  Like a stable,\r\n\r\nin his starts and stitches and solliloquies, he often roared to Pap\r\nand Mum the words “County Clerk,” “Contractor,” “Silent Alms House\r\nGovernor,” “Ex-officio Record Commissioner,” “Comptroller,” and\r\ninquired for Simeon Draper,\r\n\r\n  Whose clerk he would like to be,\r\n  In the land beyond the sea,\r\n  Called the Free America,\r\n  Where there’s “lots of trickery.”\r\n\r\nDickey may be a model Comptroller, unless he prematurely dies with\r\nproboscis paralysis.\r\n\r\nRichard Busteed was born near Tipperary, Ireland. His eyes reflected a\r\nthrilling flippancy on the fourth day. Will soon leave Tipperary with\r\nhis Daddy and Mummy for New York. Will probably excel in the sophistry\r\nand metaphysics of law. Has prodigious conscientious developments,\r\nprojecting like cliffs and promontories all over his skull. Will always\r\ndesire to pay his debts before they are due. As he matures, he will\r\nbe susceptible and impulsive to the 90th degree, and have marvellous\r\ncompunction. Will never be rude nor impolite, nor snatch candy from\r\nother boys, although his bump of snatchitiveness may grow in wild Irish\r\nluxuriance, or through Catalinian pomatum, which may cause him to\r\nsnatch pap from his Mummy’s breast, (while she is serenely snoozing, to\r\nrecruit from his unreasonable demand for pap,) which may nourish and\r\nincrease his hillock of diminutive snatchitiveness, and cause him to\r\nsnatch like Bobby Morris, and thunder and lightning, when he grows to\r\nthe size of a tailor, in America, where he will be naturalized through\r\nhis father’s residence (?) And, altogether, little Dickey Busteed is a\r\ncute infant, and will soon be a rouser of a brat, and may rise from a\r\npetty-foggy lawyer, to a keen and pious Corporation Counsel, and might\r\nmake a very shrewd Record Commissioner, but will always be poor, from\r\nhis too moderate and compunctive legal fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncrease Record—One dollar a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecrease Record—One dollar a line.\r\n\r\nPaupers Gratis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarine Intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Clipper_ Stephen H.
