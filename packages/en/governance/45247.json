R. Das, I readily acceded to their request, both\r\nfrom personal and public considerations.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have known Mr. Chitta Ranjan Das from the days of his\r\nyouth. His father, the late Babu Bhuban Mohan Das was a friend of\r\nmine. Bhuban Mohan was a well-known Attorney of the Calcutta High\r\nCourt. For some time he was connected also with Bengalee journalism. As\r\neditor, first, of the _Brahmo Public Opinion_, and subsequently of the\r\n_Bengal Public Opinion_, he made a very high position for himself among\r\nBengalee journalists. His style was very simple, and he spoke with a\r\ndirectness that was rather rare in our more successful English weeklies\r\nof those days. Babu Bhuban Mohan was a sincere patriot, and though\r\nlike good many English educated Bengalees of his generation, he threw\r\nhimself heart and soul into the Brahmo Samaj Movement, in his personal\r\nlife and more particularly in his dealings with his Hindu relatives, he\r\nbelonged to the old Hindu type, and spent whatever he earned,--and he\r\nearned a lot--for the support of his poorer relatives. Indeed he spent\r\nupon them more than his finances allowed and consequently got involved\r\nin heavy liabilities that forced him, during the closing years of his\r\nprofessional life, to take refuge in the Insolvency Court.\r\n\r\nChitta Ranjan was educated, I think, in the London Missionary College,\r\nBhowanipore; and subsequently in the Presidency College, Calcutta\r\nwhence he took his B.A. degree and went to England to qualify\r\nhimself for the Indian Civil Service. I do not remember if he actually\r\ncompeted for the I.C.S. He joined the Inns of Court and was called to\r\nthe Bar in the early Nineties.\r\n\r\nChitta Ranjan gave considerable promise of exceptional literary and\r\noratorical gifts even when he was a student in the Presidency College,\r\nCalcutta. While in England he made some political speeches, in\r\nconnection I think, with the Electioneering Campaign of Mr. Dadabhai\r\nNaoroji, and some of those speeches were very favourably noticed by the\r\nEnglish and the Indian Press.\r\n\r\nUpon his return home, and within a short time of his joining the\r\nCalcutta Bar, he took upon himself the responsibility of all his\r\nfather's debts; an act that forced him at the very commencement of his\r\nprofessional career, to join his father in seeking the protection of\r\nthe Insolvency Court. It was not only a filial duty, but a point of\r\nhonour, with Chitta. Ranjan to share this indignity with his father.\r\nHe was very seriously handicapped, both in his professional and in his\r\npublic life, by this insolvency. But for it, Chitta Ranjan would have\r\nlong ago publicly thrown himself into all our political and patriotic\r\nmovements and won the position of leadership to which he was entitled\r\nby his capacity and his devoted love for his country.\r\n\r\nThough his exceptional abilities were universally recognised, from\r\nthe very beginning of his career as a member of our High Court Bar,\r\nhe could not secure adequate scope for them for a good many years;\r\npecuniary struggles forced him to abandon the chances of a successful\r\npractice in the High Court for the mufassal practice which is more\r\nprofitable to a junior Barrister.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Conspiracy Case against Srijut Aravinda Ghosh, in which\r\nhe appeared as Aravinda's Counsel pushed Chitta Ranjan into the fore\r\nfront of the Calcutta Bar. Great was the sacrifice that he made in\r\nundertaking this defence. For more than six months he was engaged in\r\nthis case, and the fee that he received was not sufficient to meet even\r\nall his household expenses during these months; and he had to incur a\r\nlarge debt for this purpose. The acquittal of Aravinda at once raised\r\nthe reputation of his Counsel, and from the very day that Chitta Ranjan\r\ncame back to take up the broken threads of his High Court practice, he\r\nfound himself on the high road to both fame and wealth. This reminds\r\nme of the saying of Sree Bhagavan in the Geeta--that the doer of good\r\nnever comes to any grief.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he found his position in this profession secure, Chitta\r\nRanjan's first thought was to remove the stain of insolvency from his\r\nfather's name and his own and he started to pay off every pie of those\r\nold debts. This is the first time, as Mr. Justice Fletcher declared,\r\nthat a discharged insolvent publicly accepted his old liabilities and\r\napplied for a formal discharge of his insolvency. This act of unusual\r\nfidelity to his financial obligations, at once raised Chitta Ranjan Das\r\nto the position of a great moral hero.\r\n\r\nHaving secured his discharge from his insolvency, Chitta Ranjan found\r\nhimself free to freely and openly join all our public activities; and\r\nas the new National Life in Bengal, denied free scope and outlet in\r\npolitics by the restrictive legislations of Lord Minto, had commenced\r\nto seek and find expression in a variety of literary organisations.\r\nChitta Ranjan threw himself into this Nationalist Movement, and soon\r\nfound himself among its great leaders. In 1915 he started a new\r\nBengalee Monthly, the _Narayana_, which secured for its contributors\r\nsome of the highest literateurs of Bengal, including Maha-Mahopadhyaya\r\nHara Prasad Sastri who has an European reputation, and Babu Bepin\r\nChandra Pal. Chitta Ranjan's entry into Bengalee literature dates from\r\n1894 or 1895 when he published a volume of Bengalee lyrics, called\r\n_Malancha_ which introduced a new element of freedom and realism\r\ninto our modern lyrical literature. During the last two years, two\r\nmore volumes of Lyrics have been published by him. The last annual\r\nLiterary Conference of Bengal, in recognition of his literary services,\r\nnominated Chitta Ranjan as the President of its Literary Section while\r\nthe political leaders of the Province offered him an equal recognition\r\nby asking him to preside over our last Provincial Conference.\r\n\r\nThe speeches collected and published in this volume are the latest\r\npronouncements of Mr. C. R. Das upon some of the pressing political\r\nproblems before us. They have already attracted considerable notice\r\nfrom the Anglo-Indian press, and the virulance of these criticisms\r\nare themselves a _prima facie_ proof of their worth and importance. I\r\nwill not try any criticism of these here. The reader will be able to\r\njudge of their value himself. Students of current political literature\r\nin this country will find in these a freshness of ideas and a freedom\r\nof treatment which are so much needed just now for the formation of a\r\nsound and healthy public opinion among us.\r\n\r\nMr. C. R. Das, though yet young, is already an esteemed and prominent\r\nleader of Bengal. His patriotism is genuine; his abilities are\r\nunquestioned. Self-seeking is not in his line. He tries to serve his\r\nmotherland according to his light, not for his own aggrandisement but\r\nfor her welfare alone. He is above official frowns or favours--his\r\nindependence is fearless. He is not a pushing man yet his talent has\r\npushed him forward to a foremost place both in his profession and the\r\npolitical field. He earns a good deal of money but perhaps spends more.\r\nHis charities are many though the general public know very little of\r\nthem. He has a fine heart, which is ever ready to help a fellow in\r\ndistress, even at a considerable personal sacrifice. If he does not\r\nconvert himself into a mere money-making machine like many worthy\r\nmembers of his profession, he is bound to prove a tower of strength to\r\nthe national cause. He is a Home Ruler and a democrat of democrats,\r\nevery inch of him. To me he is specially dear, as he is a devotee\r\nof Sri Krishna and Sri Gauranga. As his father's friend, I have the\r\nprivilege of passing benediction on him. May God grant him a long and\r\nhealthy life and enable him to devote it unselfishly to the service of\r\nman and his maker.\r\n\r\n  AMRITA BAZAR               }\r\n  PATRIKA OFFICE, CALCUTTA,  } MOTI LAL GHOSH.\r\n  _12th November, 1917_.     }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA FOR INDIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDU MAHOMEDAN MASS MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the 7th October 1917, an enthusiastic Mass Meeting was held at\r\nCalcutta, when Mr. C. R. Das as Chairman of the meeting spoke as\r\nfollows_:--\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--When this morning Mr. Akran Khan called upon me to request\r\nme to preside over this meeting, I felt it was a call of duty to which\r\nI must respond. My heart is filled with gladness to find that on this\r\nplatform and at this meeting Hindus and Mahomedans of Calcutta have\r\nmet together to fight their common battle. Indeed in the days of the\r\nSwadeshi movement in 1905, I knew--and my friend Mr. Bipin Chandra\r\nPal will bear me out--we knew that the day was not far distant when\r\nthe Hindus and the Mahomedans will fight shoulder to shoulder in the\r\ncause of their country. I did not then know that the time was so near.\r\nWhile I must give expression to this feeling I feel at the same time, a\r\nsense of deep loss. I refer to the death of my friend Mr. Rasul. How I\r\nwish he had been here to-day to fight this battle with us shoulder to\r\nshoulder, how I wish his presence had animated us to-day. Gentlemen,\r\non the morning of the day that he died, I felt this loss but I feel it\r\noverwhelmingly to-day in this vast assembly. There is no man in Bengal,\r\nHindu or Mahomedan who was more respected by the whole Bengalee race.\r\nThere is no man in Bengal who fought so much, who exerted himself to\r\nsuch an extent to bring about the union between Hindus and Mussalmans\r\nof this country and if I may be permitted to say so, he was almost\r\nthe pioneer amongst Mahomedans, the first who felt that the interest\r\nof the Hindus and the interest of the Mahomedans is the same in spite\r\nof religious differences. Gentlemen, we have met to-day to protest\r\nagainst the policy of internment and to ask for the release of the\r\ngentlemen who have been interned. Who are the persons who are specially\r\nmentioned in your notice? I am sure you will agree with me that these\r\nare names which are respected by Mahomedans and Hindus alike. The name\r\nof Mahomed Ali is a household word in India. I had the honour of his\r\nfriendship. We met together often when he was in Calcutta and I can\r\ntell you that there is no more sincere and ardent patriot in the whole\r\nof this country than Mr. Mahomed Ali. Mr. Shaukat Ali, I do not know\r\npersonally but I have heard accounts of him from many of my friends\r\nwhich show that this gentleman is an unselfish patriot. This gentleman\r\nhad been engaged in the work of union between Hindus and Mahomedans all\r\nover India and certainly such a man is worthy of esteem and honour.\r\nThe last name is that of Sham Sunder Chakravarty. I have had personal\r\nacquaintance with him. I have been bound with him by ties of friendship\r\nand I can assure you, gentlemen, that Sham Sunder Chakravarty is\r\nincapable of having done anything which deserved his internment. I have\r\ngiven you the honoured names which are mentioned in this notice. But\r\nover and above these few names I can tell you there is hardly a home\r\nin East Bengal from which one or more persons have not been interned.\r\nEvery home in East Bengal is filled with sadness to-day, because these\r\npeople have been snatched away from their homes and imprisoned without\r\ntrial or without proof. I protest on your behalf against this policy\r\nof internment. I say this policy is un-British, is opposed to all the\r\ntime honoured traditions upon which the British Empire is based. It\r\nis opposed to all rules of common sense and prudence and uprightness\r\nand the sooner this policy is abrogated the better for the peace and\r\nprosperity of the empire.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, at a time when the British Government in its wisdom has\r\ndeclared its policy that Home Rule in some shape or other must be\r\ngranted to this country that some sort of responsible Government is\r\nnecessary for the foundation and preservation of the empire; at a\r\ntime when His Excellency the Viceroy has advised us to preserve an\r\natmosphere of calmness; I ask, is it wise to detain these men against\r\npopular opinion, against the universal desire of the Indian people.\r\nAnd why should they be detained? May we not tell those who are\r\nresponsible? You detain them under an Act which has been characterised\r\nby the highest authorities in England and in this country to be illegal\r\nand ultra vires. You have detained these men and other persons on\r\npolitical considerations which are outside the purview of the Defence\r\nof India act under which you claim to detain them. Gentlemen, I wish to\r\nread to you a passage from the judgment of one of the greatest judges\r\nin England--I may say that the Act in England is similar to the Act\r\nunder which these gentlemen have been snatched away from society and\r\nkept imprisoned. This learned Judge, Lord Shaw than whom a nobler judge\r\nthere is not in the whole of England says--You remember, gentlemen,\r\nin England persons of German origin have been sought to be detained\r\nin this way and His Lordship says:--\"But does the principle, or does\r\nit not, embrace a power not over liberty alone but also over life?\"\r\nHis Lordship says that if by the stroke of a pen you can take away the\r\nliberty of a man, does it not also follow that by the stroke of a pen\r\nyou can take away his life also? His Lordship goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n\"If the public safety and defence warrant the Government under the Act\r\nto incarcerate a citizen without trial, do they stop at that, or do\r\nthey warrant his execution without trial? If there is a power to lock\r\nup a person of hostile origin and associations because the Government\r\njudges that course to be for public safety and defence, why, on the\r\nsame principle and in exercise of the same power, may he not be shot\r\nout of hand? I put the point to the learned Attorney-General, and\r\nobtained from him no further answer than that the graver result seemed\r\nto be perfectly logical. I think it is. The cases are by no means hard\r\nto figure in which a Government in a time of unrest, and moved by a\r\nsense of duty, existed, it may be, by a gust of popular fury\"\r\n\r\nin this case the Anglo Indian fury\r\n\r\n\"might issue a regulation applying, as here, to persons of hostile\r\norigin or association, saying, 'Let such danger really be ended and\r\ndone with; let such suspects be shot.' The defence would be, I humbly\r\nthink, exactly that principle, and no other, on which the Judgments of\r\nthe Courts below are founded--namely, that during the war this power to\r\nissue regulations is so vast that it covers all acts which, though they\r\nsubvert the ordinary fundamental and constitutional rights, are in the\r\nGovernment's view directed towards the general aim of public safety or\r\ndefence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under this the Government becomes a Committee of Public Safety. But\r\nits powers as such are far more arbitrary than those as of the most\r\nfamous Committee of Public Safety known to history.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what one of the greatest of English Judges has said. Now,\r\ngentlemen, we next come to these particular cases. Mr. Mahomed Ali,\r\nas you all know--and if I have said more of him, you will pardon me,\r\nbecause he was a friend of mine,--he was asked to give an undertaking.\r\nHe gave it but he said: \"Subject to the injunctions of my religion.\"\r\nThey are all the facts which have appeared in the letter of his mother\r\nwhom judging from her letter, we all hold in deep veneration? Judging\r\nfrom that letter it seems to me that Mr. Mahomed Ali was not released\r\nbecause he would not give an unconditional undertaking, because he did\r\nnot say, \"What ever the injunctions of my religion may be I give an\r\nundertaking, the undertaking which you want.\" Well, gentlemen, I pause\r\nfor one moment and I ask you to consider according to what right or\r\nwhat principle does the Government of this country or any government in\r\nthe world, ask a man to give up his opinion and his religion? Ought he\r\nto submit to it? Is it not his duty to say at once, \"I do not care what\r\nyou do but it is my religion, I stand on it and here in this sphere I\r\nam a free man, You may hold my body imprisoned but my soul is in the\r\nhands of God.\" Now gentlemen, exactly, that illustration was given by\r\nthis great judge in his judgment. His Lordship goes on to say:--\r\n\r\nNo far-fetched illustrations are needed; for, My Lords, there is\r\nsomething which may and does move the actions of men often far more\r\nthan origin or association, and that is religion. Under its influence\r\nmen may cherish belief which are very disconcerting to the Government\r\nof the day, and hold opinion which the Government may consider\r\ndangerous to the safety of the realm. And so, if the principle of this\r\nconstruction of the statute be sound, to what a strange pass have we\r\ncome! A regulation may issue against Roman Catholics--all, or, say,\r\nin the South of Ireland, or against Jews--all, or, say in the East of\r\nLondon,--they may lose their liberty without a trial. During the war\r\nthat entire chapter of the removal of Catholic and Jewish disabilities\r\nwhich has made the toleration of British famous through the world may\r\nbe removed not because her Parliament has expressly said so, but by\r\nthe stroke of the pen of a Secretary of State. Vested with this power\r\nof proscription, and permitted to enter the sphere of opinion and\r\nbelief, they, who alone can judge as to public safety and defence,\r\nmay reckon a political creed their special care, and if that creed be\r\nsocialism, pacifism, republicanism, the persons holding such creeds\r\nmay be regulated out of the way although never deed was done or word\r\nuttered by them that could be charged as a crime. The inmost citadel of\r\nour liberties would be thus attacked. For, as Sir Erskine May observes,\r\nthis is \"the greatest of all our liberties--liberty of opinion.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, is life worth living if we have not that liberty of opinion?\r\nYou may differ from me, I may differ from you--you must be allowed to\r\nhold your own opinion, I must be allowed to hold mine. Members of the\r\nCivil Service may hold one opinion, I may hold another opinion. His\r\nExcellency the Viceroy may hold another opinion. His Majesty the King\r\nEmperor personally may hold one opinion and I may hold the contrary\r\nopinion--but is opinion a crime? Has it ever been a crime in the\r\nhistory of civilization? We hoped that the dark ages have gone but it\r\nseems that it still lingers. Now, apart from the opinion of this great\r\njudge, I rely,--I venture to think I have got the right to rely--upon\r\nthe gracious Proclamation of 1858. Let me quote to you, gentlemen, the\r\npassage which has been often quoted and which we regard as our Magna\r\nCharta. It says this;--\r\n\r\n\"Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity and\r\nacknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike\r\nthe right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our\r\nsubjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be\r\nin anywise favoured, none molested or disquieted, by reason of their\r\nreligious faith or observances, but that all shall alike enjoy the\r\nequal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge\r\nand enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain\r\nfrom all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of\r\nour subjects on pain of our highest displeasure.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I venture to think, that the Government, His Excellency\r\nthe Viceroy or the Members of Council whoever may be responsible for\r\nit, has absolutely no right to demand an undertaking which in any\r\nway goes against the dictates of his religion. I hold in my hands\r\nthe Magna Charta, I hold in my hands the very words used by Queen\r\nVictoria Empress of India, viz., \"all those we charge and strictly\r\nenjoin, who may be in authority\" and in this case the Council here\r\nis in authority,--\"that they abstain from all interference with the\r\nreligious belief or worship of any of our subjects on pain of our\r\nhighest displeasure.\" His Excellency should know and the Council should\r\nknow that by this act they are going against the Proclamation of 1858,\r\naccording to which they would incur the displeasure of His Majesty\r\nthe King. It is not we who are against the King, it is not we who are\r\ngoing against the principles upon which this Empire is based. It is\r\nthose who Snatch away our liberty without just cause, without trial.\r\nNow, gentlemen, all these considerations might have been placed before\r\nthe Government--I am sure the Government would have listened and done\r\njustice--but there is a difficulty in our way.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is the European Association. We are used to the\r\ntricks of the European Association. In the days of the Ilbert Bill\r\nAgitation, we saw what the Anglo Indians can do. But then, public\r\nopinion had hardly been born in this country. To-day, again when the\r\nBritish Government has recognised the policy of self-Government we\r\nhear the same uproar. These people who come here to make money, who\r\ncome here penniless and when they retire, take away thousands and\r\nthousands--these people pretend to talk in the name of India when\r\nthey say that these gentlemen, these honoured gentlemen should not\r\nbe released because they knew that if they are released, they will\r\nstrengthen the party which seeks Self-Government, because they know\r\nthat when Mr. Mahomed Ali comes out, when Babu Sham Sunder Chakravarty\r\ncomes out, they will fight shoulder to shoulder for the cause of\r\nSelf-Government in this country. And if Self-Government is granted\r\nwhat about the policy of these merchants? If Self-Government is\r\ngranted the authority of Magistrates and Collectors in every district\r\nwill be lessened--and then what would happen to these gentlemen who\r\nwrite letters to Collectors saying,--my dear so and so, will you see\r\nthis done and will you see that done? It is a notorious fact in this\r\ncountry--and I have heard complaints from many Indian Merchants engaged\r\nin the coal trade--that they cannot get waggons at a time when English\r\nmerchants are fully supplied with waggons. These are the advantages\r\nwhich they get by this country being ruled not by the people of this\r\ncountry but by a bureaucracy. That really is the reason of this\r\nAnglo-Indian agitation.\r\n\r\nI must refer to the speeches made by these knights of Anglo-India\r\nagainst the interests of this country and against the policy of\r\nSelf-Government. I will first of all refer to the foolish speech of\r\nArden Wood. This gentleman is reported to have said: \"If racial feeling\r\nis to be dominant in Indian politics the time will come, when we,\r\nthe British will either have to leave India or reconquer it.\" Now,\r\ngentlemen, it is difficult to take this speech seriously. They may\r\nleave India if they find it unprofitable to stay in India. They may\r\nstay in India if they find it profitable to do so but the tall talk of\r\nreconquering India is a comical statement. It reminds me of the bravery\r\nof the valiant Pistol and Corporal Nymph. If this gentleman does not\r\nknow, he ought to know that India was never conquered. India was won by\r\nlove and won by promise of good government. India was never conquered\r\nand God willing, it will never be conquered for all time to come. India\r\nwill impress her ideal, her civilization, and her culture upon the\r\nwhole world. The work has commenced to-day. It will go on increasing\r\ntill the world will listen to the message of India.\r\n\r\nSome of the other speakers made very angry speeches. One gentleman\r\nis reported to have said that if there is a government by the people\r\nand for the people then there will be no security for life and\r\n\"prosperity.\" Mark the word prosperity. I do not know whether the\r\nprinter's devil is responsible for this but if he is, this devil has\r\ngot a perfect knowledge of the internal affairs. The apprehension\r\nof this speaker is that if there is Self-government, there will be\r\nno security or prosperity. Whose prosperity may we ask? Is it the\r\nprosperity of India, is it the prosperity of the teeming millions\r\nof our country or is it the prosperity of Sir Archy Birkmyre? Whose\r\nprosperity? If the granting of Home Rule to this country means the\r\npoverty of Sir Archy Birkmyre, let it be so, but still Self-government\r\nmust be granted. India does not live for Sir Archy Birkmyre or the\r\npetty traders who come here and rob us of our money. India lives for\r\nherself--she has lived for herself for centuries and she will live\r\nin herself and for herself for all time to come. There is another\r\nstatement made by this angry speaker, which takes my breath away. He\r\nsays that this agitation of the European Association is to assert the\r\nrights of the British in India. The rights of the British in India!\r\nThe little-minded traders who at a time when the Government enjoins a\r\ncalm atmosphere, hold a meeting and proceed straight away to denounce\r\nthe whole country; and abuse the people and all the ideals for which\r\nthey fight and in which they live and move and have their being--these\r\nmen claim the right to represent the British. The British indeed! When\r\nHis Majesty's ministers say that there should be Home Rule, there\r\nshould be Self-Government, that the people of this country should be\r\ngranted equal partnership with the people of England in the Empire, who\r\nare these traders who claim to represent British interest in India?\r\nGentlemen, I will not take you through the many comical statements\r\nmade by this entertaining band of players, Jones-Birkmyre Company.\r\nThey are used to many tricks. I will refer to some of the 'Statesman'\r\nnewspaper, which used to pose as the Friend of India at one time. I\r\nthink it has given up all that pretence now. This \"Statesman\" came\r\nout one day with a furious article on the Extremists of Bengal and\r\npraised the Moderates and the next day it said that there did not seem\r\nto be any difference between the Extremists and the Moderates. Well,\r\nthe reason for that is quite clear. There is in fact, no difference.\r\nThis distinction was invented by the \"Statesman\" newspaper some years\r\nago. We can frankly tell the Anglo-Indian community that there are no\r\nExtremists among us, no Moderates. The Hindus and Mahomedans of Bengal\r\nare all Nationalists--they are neither Extremists nor Moderates. I may\r\ntell you who are the Extremists. It is those Anglo-Indian Agitators\r\nwho are the worst Extremists. You talk of a calm atmosphere! Who broke\r\nthat calm? It is you Anglo-Indian Agitators. It is Sir Hugh Bray,\r\nit is the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, it is the speakers who\r\nspoke at the meeting of the European Association. These people broke\r\nthe calm. I ask them to consider the position and beware. The days of\r\nthe Ilbert Bill agitation have gone by. These are the days of rising\r\nDemocracy in this country. We will no longer tolerate that sort of\r\nvapourings, that kind of abuse. If, in spite of that, they persist\r\nin their wicked agitation, we shall soon know how to deal with them.\r\nWe are fighting in the best interests of the Empire, we are fighting\r\nfor the ideal expressed by the King's ministers, we are fighting for\r\ncarrying out that very policy which has been declared in England by His\r\nMajesty's ministers, and by His Excellency the Viceroy in this country.\r\nIf you dare stand against that, we will know how to deal with you. Be\r\nassured, we Indians do not deny your legitimate share whatever may be\r\nthe extent of that share in the Government of this country. We know\r\nwhat you mean when you say that Self-government is no good, because\r\nSelf-government would be against the interests of the teeming millions\r\nof India. We know the hollowness of that hyrocricy. But we can tell\r\nthese gentlemen, so far as I am concerned, at any rate, I am perfectly\r\nclear,--that we shall accept no Self-government, no Home Rule unless it\r\nrecognises and includes within it the teeming millions of India. When\r\nI ask for Home Rule, for Self-Government, I am not asking for another\r\nbureaucracy, another oligarchy in the place of the bureaucracy that\r\nthere is at present. In my opinion, bureaucracy is bureaucracy, be that\r\nbureaucracy of Englishman or of Anglo-Indians or of Indians. We want no\r\nbureaucracy, we want Home Rule, we want Self-government by the people\r\nand for the people. We want Self-government in which every individual\r\nof this country, be he the poorest ryot or the richest zemindar--will\r\nhave his legitimate share. Every individual must have some voice. We\r\nwant Home Rule, broad based on the will of the people of India. Now,\r\ngentlemen, this is our objective. Do they still say or can they, in\r\nreason, say, that we are not asking Home Rule on behalf and in the\r\ninterest of the teeming millions of India? If they say we have got no\r\nright to ask for it in their interest, my answer is we have a thousand\r\ntimes greater right to ask for them than you who never know them or\r\ncare for them. India has always been tolerant towards those people,\r\nwhatever their religious creed or faith may be, who have made India\r\ntheir Home--every one of them is my brother and I embrace him with\r\nopen arms. The history of India has made it abundantly clear. We have\r\nthe Parsis in India. They adopted India as their home and to-day we\r\nembrace them as our brothers. We have had hosts of Mahomedan invaders\r\nwho came to this country as conquerors but they made this country their\r\nhome and to-day we embrace them with open arms. If these Anglo-Indians\r\nwant to make India their home, let them do so and we will work hand in\r\nhand with them in the interest of the Indian Empire. But, if they come\r\nhere to make money and all their interest is how best to make it, I say\r\nthey are no friends of India, they have got no right to call themselves\r\nIndians, they have got no legitimate right to oppose the granting of\r\nself-good to the people of India. I say to them. \"Come here if you\r\nwant. Make money if you can. Go away in peace if you want to do so.\"\r\n\r\nI said that our difficulty is, the mischievous working of the European\r\nassociation. Let us be united, gentlemen. Let us assist the Government\r\nagainst this selfish and unreal agitation. I feel sure the victory is\r\nours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC MEETING--MYMENSINGH\r\n\r\n\r\n_A large meeting of the people of Mymensingh was held in October 1917,\r\nat the Surjakanta Hall, under the presidency of Babu Anathbandhu Guha\r\nto formulate a scheme of responsible Government for India, when Mr. C.\r\nR. Das addressed as follows_:--\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, and gentlemen--I thank you heartily for calling upon me\r\nto address you to-night. This is my first visit to Mymensingh. Before I\r\narrived here, I really did not know that I had so many friends amongst\r\nyou. My friend Mr. Guha has referred to my unselfish activities. I am\r\nsure I do not deserve that praise. But this I will claim for myself\r\nthat whenever the interest of the country required my services, I\r\nhave never lagged behind. I might not have always adopted the right\r\ncourse--I might have been wrong, every one of us is often wrong but I\r\nhave always honestly tried to place the interest of the country above\r\nall considerations. With me work for my country is not imitation of\r\nEuropean politics. It is part of my religion. It is part and parcel of\r\nall the idealism of my life. I find in the conception of my country the\r\nexpression also of divinity. With me nationality is no mere political\r\nconception borrowed from the philosophy of the west. With me a nation\r\nhas to grow because a nation must grow. God's universe teems with\r\nvarieties of life. Every nation is one unit of such life. Every nation\r\nmust grow, to the evolution of life. The nation to which I belong must\r\nalso grow, only we must help in its growth. I value this principle of\r\nnationality as I value the principle of morality and religion. The\r\nservice of country and nationality is service of humanity. Service of\r\nhumanity is worship of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENGAL HAS A MESSAGE TO DELIVER\r\n\r\nTo-night I wish to say a few words to you about the present political\r\nsituation in our country. Do not imagine gentlemen, that your political\r\nsituation is detached from other matters which belong to our country.\r\nPolitical activity is part and parcel of your culture; it is the\r\npractice of your patriotism; it is the expression of your religion. I\r\nnever believe in watertight compartments of human culture. There are\r\npeople of this country, who try to divide the whole field of human\r\nlife into so many compartments or divisions. With them politics is\r\none thing, religion, education--these things have nothing to do with\r\npolitics. With them religion is a different branch altogether. Neither\r\npolitics nor education has anything to do with it. They forget that\r\nhuman soul is one, they forget that the individuality of human beings\r\nis one complex whole covering many activities. As the individual soul\r\nis one, so the national soul is one. I do not desire to deal with the\r\npolitical situation of to-day in any narrow spirit or in a spirit which\r\nis borrowed from the politics of Europe,--much as I venerate European\r\nculture, much as I love and much as I acknowledge my indebtedness to\r\nthe education which I had in Europe, I cannot forget that Bengal stands\r\nfor something higher than that. I cannot forget that our nationality\r\nmust not rest content with borrowing things from European politics--and\r\nI repeat what I said elsewhere, that Bengal has a message to give to\r\nthe world. When you will find that infant nationality has grown and we\r\nhave developed according to our light our country will deliver that\r\nmessage and the world will listen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREDOMINANT NOTE IN THE POLITICAL SITUATION\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, what is the predominant note in the political situation\r\nof to-day. I refer the many attempts which are being made to introduce\r\nin this country some kind of Self-government. Some people call it\r\nSelf-government, others call it Home Rule, others again Swaraj--but\r\nwe need not quarrel with words, they all mean the same thing. I would\r\nmuch rather you should give your attention to the thing itself than the\r\nname with which you want to call that thing. Now, what is it which is\r\nnecessary in the interest of our race--not only in the interest of our\r\nrace (but in the interest of the world at large)--for no race can have\r\nits self-interest fulfilled in the highest degree without at the same\r\ntime contributing to the interest of the empire and of the human race.\r\nSo I ask you to consider what is necessary for you to have by way of\r\nSelf-government. It is abundantly clear that the highest authorities\r\nin England have come to the conclusion--our politicians and many other\r\npersons who have devoted their time and energy to the cause of the\r\ncountry have also come to the conclusion--that we must have some form\r\nof Government which may be described as Government by the people and\r\nfor the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT OUR POLITICS CONSISTS IN\r\n\r\nNow gentlemen, I desire to point out one thing clearly here. It has\r\nbeen said by Anglo-Indian newspapers and Anglo-Indian agitators that\r\nour politics consist in abusing the Government. Well I deny that\r\ncharge in toto. Our politics consists in this that we want some\r\nkind of Government which may be described as responsible Government\r\naccording to the principles of constitutional law. We want some sort\r\nof Government in which the Government officials will be responsible to\r\nthe people whom they govern. We have no quarrel with individuals. If\r\na civilian official does some wrong in some place we feel we have to\r\ncriticise his actions. But my objection will not be met by replacing\r\nthe whole of the Civil Service by Bengalees. My quarrel is not with\r\nindividuals, my quarrel is with the system--it is an evil system. It\r\nmight have been necessary at one time. It has done its work and is no\r\nlonger necessary. It hampers our growth at the present moment--anything\r\nwhich stands against our growing nationality, I have no hesitation in\r\ndescribing that as an evil. The time has come when this system should\r\nbe cast away as a 'creed outworn.'\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT KIND OF GOVERNMENT WE WANT\r\n\r\nGentlemen, if you have once made up your mind that you want some kind\r\nof Government which will be responsible to the people, the next point\r\nto consider will be, what kind of Government is it that you want. We\r\ncannot forget that we live in the midst of an empire, the largest and\r\nthe most glorious empire in the history of the human race. We cannot\r\nforget that our interests are bound up intimately with the interest of\r\nEngland. We cannot forget that our interests are also bound up with\r\nthe interests of Australia and South Africa. All of us live and grow\r\nunder the sway of the same Empire. If you consider the geographical\r\nmagnitude of this Empire, the different races, the different creeds,\r\nthe different cultures, the different religions which this empire\r\nrepresents, you will find that here is a glorious opportunity for\r\nfederating so many human races, with so many distinct interests,\r\ndistinct nationalities, different cultures, different religions and\r\nin that way for contributing to the ultimate federation of the whole\r\nhuman race. That is the philosophy of nationalism to-day. Therefore\r\nfirst of all, we must get a government which will be autonomous in so\r\nfar as it will be government by the people and for the people. The\r\ndifferent provincial governments are to be connected together by some\r\nsort of central government and then again that central government is to\r\nbe connected up with the different parts of this vast empire. That is\r\nthe sort of Government for which the time has come for which to make a\r\ndefinite scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RENUNCIATION OF POLICY\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of 1858, impliedly promised some such free autonomous\r\nrepresentative government. Years rolled by, we passed through many\r\nchanges, we had many different promises on different occasions, but\r\nthese promises had never been redeemed. The other day, His Majesty the\r\nKing-Emperor came to this country and from his lips, we had the message\r\nof hope. Though we have been disappointed over and over again, the time\r\nhas come when these promises must be redeemed. In connection with the\r\npolitical situation of the present moment, I ask you to consider first\r\nthe statement of the Secretary of State for India, which was published\r\non the 20th August last (1917). I invite your particular attention to\r\nthe words of that statement. I will read out to you certain portions\r\nwhich are significant of what is to come.\r\n\r\n \"The policy of His Majesty's Government etc., etc., is that\r\n of increasing the association of Indians in every branch of\r\n administration and the gradual development of self-governing\r\n institutions with a view to the progressive realization of responsible\r\n government in India, as an integral part of the British Empire etc.,\r\n etc.\"\r\n\r\nI draw your particular attention to the words \"Progressive realization\r\nof responsible government in India, as an integral part of the\r\nBritish Empire.\" That is the ideal which the Secretary of State has\r\nsketched out. What is the deduction from this? What is it that we\r\nhave got to hope for from this statement? It is this: that there will\r\nbe several representative institutions and that these institutions\r\nwill be responsible institutions and that these institutions will\r\nform the Government of India, which will be an integral part of the\r\nBritish Empire. Now, what does that mean? It means that there should\r\nbe autonomous governments in every province that these provincial\r\ngovernments are to be responsible and autonomous, that is to say,\r\nresponsible not to the Government of India, not to anything which\r\nis above them, but to the people, the electors who would elect the\r\nrepresentatives to these autonomous legislative bodies. That is the\r\ndoctrine of responsible self-government as it is understood in politics\r\nand in constitutional law. Now, therefore, you get these provincial\r\ngovernments which are responsible to the people, i.e. the members\r\nbeing elected by the people and you get these autonomous governments\r\nconnected with the Government of India and again the Government of\r\nIndia connected with the Empire. How that connection will be served\r\nhas been described by certain political thinkers in England but I do\r\nnot desire to deal with it because before it is declared as the policy\r\nof Government, we have no right to take those utterances as part of\r\nany statement by the Government. Having sketched out this ideal, the\r\nSecretary of State goes on to say; \"They have decided that substantial\r\nsteps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, gentlemen, you get two things perfectly distinct in this\r\nstatement and I appeal to you that you should not lose sight of\r\nthese two, viz. the ideal of responsible government which will be\r\nrepresentative in the highest sense of the word and which will be\r\nconnected with the empire and secondly, some steps should be taken\r\nimmediately in that direction. That is the declaration of policy made\r\nby His Majesty's Government. We have, therefore, a right to expect that\r\nsome definite steps will be taken soon towards the practical attainment\r\nof that ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VICEROY ON SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe next thing to which I wish to refer is the speech of His Excellency\r\nthe Viceroy, delivered on the 5th of September. I will only refer to\r\nthat part of it which deals with this ideal of self-government. His\r\nExcellency says:--\r\n\r\n \"I now turn to the third task, viz., constitutional reforms. At\r\n the very first Executive Council, which I held as Viceroy and\r\n Governor-General, I propounded two questions to my Council: (1) What\r\n is the goal of British Rule in India? (2) What are the steps on the\r\n road to that goal? We came to the conclusion which, I trust most Hon.\r\n Members will agree, was inevitable, that the endowment of British\r\n India, as an integral part of the British Empire, with self-government\r\n was the goal of British Rule, and His Majesty's Government have not\r\n put forward in precise terms their policy, which we may say that\r\n we as the Government of India regard in substance as practically\r\n indistinguishable from that which we put forward, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said what the goal is, His Excellency proceeds to say that the\r\nfirst road to that goal is in the domain of local self-government,\r\nvillage, rural, town or municipal.\r\n\r\nThe second road is in the domain of more responsible employment of\r\nIndians under the Government. Referring to the third, His Excellency\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n \"We come now to our third road, which lay in the domain of Legislative\r\n Councils. As Hon. Members will readily appreciate, there is no\r\n subject on which so much difference of opinion exists, and with\r\n regard to which greater need is required for careful investigation\r\n and sober decision. I may say frankly that we, as the Government of\r\n India, recognise fully that an advance must be made on this road\r\n simultaneously with the advances on the other two, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nI draw your attention to this. We, therefore, have got the right to\r\nhope that not only will this work of local self-government commence\r\nbut simultaneously, along with that, work in the other two domains must\r\nalso commence, His Excellency says:--\r\n\r\n \"And His Majesty's Government, in connection with the goal which they\r\n have outlined in their announcement have decided that substantial\r\n steps in the direction of the goal they define should be taken as soon\r\n as possible.\"\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, gentlemen, that we have got a right to expect that in\r\nthe near future some substantial steps should be taken for granting to\r\nthe people of this country that government which is responsible, which\r\nis representative and which is an integral part of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DIFFICULTIES BEGAN\r\n\r\nAfter these declarations were made, difficulties began. On the one\r\nhand, it filled us with hope that many of us, I must confess, did not\r\nexamine this statement minutely and critically and had only a vague\r\nimpression as to what was going to be done and were unduly suspicious,\r\nbut on the whole, it has made us hope for the realization of that which\r\nwe have been fighting for, for the last 50 years. On the other hand,\r\nit gave rise to despair in other people. I would ask you to mark the\r\ndates. The statement of the Secretary of State was made on the 20th\r\nof August. On the 13th of September the memorable pronouncement was\r\nmade by His Excellency the Viceroy. On the 20th September, Sir Hugh\r\nBray and Mr. Hogg spoke in the Indian Legislative Council; and they\r\nat once made it clear that it was nonsense to think of any kind of\r\nSelf-government so far as India is concerned. I ask you to note that\r\nfact because I shall ask you to consider what followed, in the light\r\nof that interesting event which took place on the 20th September. I\r\nam referring to the speeches made by Sir Hugh Bray and Mr. Hogg. Now,\r\nSir Hugh Bray, apart from criticising the political activities of the\r\npeople of this country--I will not retaliate by abuse for abuse--made\r\nit perfectly clear by saying this: \"It is not we who wanted a change\r\nin the method of Government.\" So, Sir Hugh Bray does not want a change\r\nin the method of Government. The European Association, 6 days after,\r\ndeclared that they did not want a change in the method of Government in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT A WILD INFERENCE?\r\n\r\nIs it a wild inference to draw from these two significant events\r\nthat these people did not want a change in the method of Government\r\nin this country, because they know the present system of Government\r\nis the most profitable to them? If any one draws that inference, is\r\nhe to be characterised as a violent speaker? I say the dates and the\r\nspeeches speak for themselves. It is idle to say afterwards we were\r\nnot against changes, we wanted our interest to be safeguarded. The\r\nfact is they did not want a change and why should they? If I had been\r\nan Anglo-Indian merchant, I should not have wanted a change. They say\r\nthat they have sunk capital in this country. I do not know the exact\r\nextent of that capital. My impression is--I speak from my impression\r\nand I am subject to correction, but I think I am right--that for\r\nwhatever capital they invested, they have taken out a great deal more\r\nin the shape of profits. But granting that they have sunk capital in\r\nthis country, what right does it give them to dictate to the people of\r\nthis country that the method of this particular Government is not to\r\nbe changed. British capital has been invested in America, France and\r\nGermany. Does any British Merchant ever dream that they have got the\r\nright to dictate to the American, French, or German Government about\r\nthe method of their particular Government? Why is it that the sinking\r\nof capital should have such a different effect on the soil of this\r\ncountry? The reason is perfectly clear. In America, they would not\r\nstand such nonsense, in France they will be asked to keep quiet. But it\r\nis only in this country that these merchants who have sunk capital--I\r\nam assuming that they have and that it still remains unrealised--can\r\nput forward the claim that the Government of this country should be\r\nrun in their interest and not in the interest of the people of India.\r\nThey see the absurdity of their position and because they see the utter\r\nabsurdity of this illogical and extravagant claim which they make in\r\nfurtherance of their self-interest they have to say that they are the\r\nreal representatives of India. They say: \"We are speaking not only on\r\nour behalf but on behalf of the teeming millions of this country. You\r\nare professional agitators,\" I do not understand what they mean by\r\n\"professional agitators\"--nobody pays me or Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea\r\nor any of my friends for making speeches. However, what they mean is\r\nthis: that the speakers belong to a particular profession (?) I happen\r\nto belong to law. Many of my friends who have to make speeches belong\r\nto the medical profession or some other profession. But these speakers\r\nof the European Association also belong to some profession or trade.\r\nSir Archy Birkmyre has also his trade to ply, the other merchants I\r\nsuppose make their profits, Mr. Jones of the \"Statesman\" gets his\r\nwages--and even the fire-eater of the Lamartinaire College must draw\r\nhis pay. Mr. Pugh I do not think forgets to send in his bills of costs.\r\nThat is not what they mean. They have got to find out some ground of\r\nabuse. Therefore they say \"Oh those professional agitators, these\r\nwicked agitators, do not listen to them for one single moment. The\r\nteeming millions of this country do not want them.\" No, gentlemen, our\r\ncountrymen do not want us. They want Mr. Jones of the \"Statesman\" and\r\nthe other celebrities who exhibited their eloquence at that meeting!\r\nThese worthies next proceed to demonstrate the utter absurdity of any\r\nidea of self-government for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGE OF ILLITERACY\r\n\r\nMr. Jones in his speech says that out of a total of 315 millions of\r\npeople in this country only a very few know how to read and write.\r\nI take it that he asks us to infer from that people who do not know\r\nhow to read and write are worthless--they have got no conscience of\r\ntheir own they do not know what is good and what is bad--they cannot\r\nchoose between Mr. Jones and Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea. Well, I deny\r\nthat proposition. I do not know what it is in Europe but so far as the\r\nteeming millions of our country are concerned, I have very often come\r\nacross men who are called illiterate, but I can assure you that great\r\nmany of them are shrewd men of business. They are certainly competent\r\nto judge as to who could look after their interest better whether it is\r\nSir Archy Birkmyre or any one of us. They are certainly in a position\r\nto judge that. But if they are illiterate, may we ask why have they\r\nremained so? What has the Government done, if at the close of a hundred\r\nand fifty years, so many in this country have remained illiterate, and\r\nin such a state that they cannot choose their own representatives?\r\nThat itself is the surest condemnation of the present method cf\r\nGovernment. It has got to be changed and I can assure you if some kind\r\nof self-government is granted to us in the near future within the\r\nnext twenty years there will not be one single illiterate man in this\r\ncountry. I throw out this challenge: let them put us in that position,\r\ngive us power to work out our own good and I am sure that before many\r\nyears are over the people in this country will be better than people of\r\nmost countries. The illiteracy of our people is one of the strongest\r\ngrounds upon which we put our claim for Home Rule. We say that we are\r\nnot being allowed to develop. We say that our infant nationality is\r\nbeing choked. We are the inheritors of a great culture. We are the\r\nstewards of a spirituality which must be presented to the world. We\r\nmust rekindle that fire. That which is dormant must be brought to life\r\nand light. Self-government alone can do that. Gentlemen, be he European\r\nor Indian, who stands for self-government in this country stands\r\nfor Humanity and God. Our Anglo-Indian friends have this glorious\r\nopportunity. The other day in Calcutta I criticised their speeches.\r\nTo-day I wish to refer to some of the statements made by Mr. Jones of\r\n\"Statesman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY ANTICS OF THE \"FRIEND OF INDIA.\"\r\n\r\nYou remember, gentlemen, we had some differences in the Reception\r\nCommittee. We have made them up. I do not wish in the least degree\r\nto refer to any of these disputes, but these are disputes which must\r\noccur in every healthy community, in every political organization,\r\nwhich is not absolutely lifeless. As soon as these disputes occurred,\r\nthe \"Statesman\" was in high glee. What did it say? \"Oh the extremists,\r\nyou have been found out; oh, the good moderates, do not mix with the\r\nextremists, we will embrace you. Don't you make that mistake.\" Articles\r\nwere written, crying down the extremists and heaping abuse upon them.\r\nIf any Indian speaker had used half those expressions, he would at\r\nonce have been denounced by the \"Statesman\" as a wild agitator. But\r\nthe \"Statesman\" is not wild, it is very tame and in that tame way,\r\nit tried to accentuate the differences between the two parties. Our\r\ndisputes were settled as they must be settled. If they had not been,\r\nboth parties would have accepted the decision of the All-India Congress\r\nCommittee. Directly the disputes were settled, the \"Statesman\" thought\r\nof the stories of Alphonso and it tried to be jocular. In one of the\r\nstories, the \"Statesman\" said, it is said that kids do not eat up\r\nwolves but it is the wolves who eat up kids; and the wolves of the\r\nextremists have eaten up the kids of the moderates. However, the\r\nrevelation came upon Mr. Jones not after many years but in the course\r\nof a few days that there were no Moderates in India. I entirely agree\r\nwith him; only I wish to add a rider that there are no Extremists\r\neither. We are all Nationalists.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days the question of the internment of Mr. Mahomed Ali\r\narose and I had the honour of presiding over a meeting in Calcutta of\r\nboth Hindus and Mahomedans to protest against the internments. The\r\nnext day, the \"Statesman\" published long accounts of Bakr-Id riots and\r\nsaid that Hindus and Mahomedans in this country could never unite. That\r\nis the policy of the \"Statesman.\" Do you believe that the \"Statesman\"\r\nnewspaper ever thought that there was any possible distinction between\r\nthe people whom it characterised as Extremists and those whom it\r\ncharacterised as Moderates? Does the \"Statesman\" not know that the\r\ninterests of Mahomedans and the interests of Hindus are identical? of\r\ncourse, it knows but it chooses not to say so because it has got its\r\nown interests to serve. I wish to call some gems from Mr. Jone's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEMS FROM MR. JONES' SPEECH\r\n\r\nHe says: \"Because I am satisfied that in this country the struggle\r\nwill be very hard, possibly fruitless\"--oh, the pathos!--it breaks my\r\nheart--\"and that our real course of action lies in bringing the cant\r\nhome to the people of England and impostures with which they have been\r\nstuffed.\" Cant and imposture with which the British people have been\r\nstuffed--that is the general proposition I quote from Mr. Jones:\r\n\r\n\"The next imposture, the next abuse of political terms is connected\r\nwith these words Legislative Councils. There are Legislative Councils\r\nin the Colonies which are really and truly Legislative Assemblies\r\ncorresponding to our Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nNobody has any doubt about that!\r\n\r\n\"Now, a Legislative Council in India is a very different thing.\"\r\n\r\nExactly so! That is our grievance, we complain that our Legislative\r\nCouncils are shams. They are without power, without responsibility. But\r\nlet us see how he makes that out to be an imposture;\r\n\r\n\"But the trick played is to confuse the two and to make out to the\r\nBritish people that a Legislative Council in India is just such a\r\nrepresentative body as one of these Colonial Parliaments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JONES' LOGIC\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard anything like that? Yet this is said by Mr. Jones.\r\nHe says that we Indians have said in England that our Legislative\r\nCouncils are exactly like those in the Colonies. Is not it too\r\nridiculous for words? We say that our Legislative Councils are shams\r\nbecause they are not representative. We ask for such a grant of Home\r\nRule that our Legislative Councils may be like those in Australia.\r\nBut Mr. Jones says that we have deceived the English people by saying\r\nthat our Legislative Councils are truly representative bodies. Does\r\nhe think that he was doing some conjuring trick? Well, that is the\r\nsort of imposture with which he fed his audience. I will give you one\r\nother sample and finish with Mr. Jones. You have read those speeches\r\nand noticed that when the name of the Secretary of State was mentioned\r\nby one of the speakers the audience hissed aloud. If any speech could\r\nbring the Government into discredit and contempt, it was the speech\r\nof Mr. Jones. The people who become violently immoderate in speech and\r\nsentiment when their selfish interests are attacked are the people who\r\nlecture us to be moderate in our expressions. I ask you to say if I am\r\nnot right in calling these agitators as extremists. I said elsewhere\r\nthere are no moderates or extremists among us, but the real extremists\r\nare those people who by their actions and by their words have betrayed\r\nthe Government of this country and also the people of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR ATTITUDE LOYAL THROUGHOUT.\r\n\r\nOur whole attitude on the question of self-government is to hold to\r\nthe banner of the moirs. Our attitude has been loyal throughout and\r\nas I read out to you the statements of the Secretary of State and the\r\nViceroy you have found that our demands are based on the words and the\r\nspirit of those statements. We are for the empire, they are for selfish\r\ninterests of their own. We are for a great ideal, they are for their\r\nmoney. That is the difference between the Anglo-Indian agitators and\r\nourselves. Well, gentlemen, do not be troubled by these agitators. Let\r\nthem go on in their way. They ought to realise that the days of the\r\nIlbert Bill agitation are dead and gone and buried for ever. They have\r\nno right to dictate anything to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD TO ANGLO-INDIAN EXTREMISTS\r\n\r\nThe Government of the country has openly declared its policy and the\r\npeople of this country are in sympathy with that policy; they will try\r\nto assist the Government in carrying out that scheme. And if these\r\nAnglo-Indian Extremists should come in the way, they should be told\r\nonce for all that India is not their home, India is our home--our\r\nfathers have lived here for thousands of years. The dust of this\r\ncountry is sacred to us. Every incident of its history is part of our\r\nScripture. Who are you who have come here to make profits, who are you\r\nto stand between us and the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE BANNER OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nI say again the message of hope which His Majesty the King-Emperor gave\r\nus is about to be redeemed. The banner of the empire is uplifted. Let\r\nus close our ranks; let us be united. Let us put forward a definite,\r\nand reasonable and sufficient scheme. Let us not be timid. Let us not\r\nbe foolhardy. Let us fight this battle for the honour of this country\r\nand for the glory of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT MEETING AT DACCA\r\n\r\n\r\n_A meeting of the citizens of Dacca was held in the spacious room of\r\nthe Bar Library on the 11th October 1917, Babu Ananda Chandra Ray,\r\nDacca, presided, when Mr. C. R. Das spoke as follows_:--\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen,--I thank you very much for calling upon\r\nme to address you to-night on the question, which of all questions\r\nis agitating the mind of all of our countrymen to-day. Whatever the\r\nAnglo-Indians may say, I believe, I am speaking the truth when I say\r\nthat there is hardly an educated man in the country who is not to-day\r\nthinking of self-Government. And I say further that every educated\r\nman in this country has a right to think of Self-Government. If you\r\nconsider the history of the public events for the last five years,\r\nyou cannot but come to the conclusion that the time has come when the\r\neducated community of this country, taking such assistance from their\r\nuneducated brethren as they can, must think out clearly and rationally\r\nas to what form of Self-Government they might expect and they insist\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS MAJESTY'S MESSAGE OF HOPE\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I begin with the King-Emperor's Message of Hope which His\r\nMajesty personally delivered to this country before he left the shores\r\nof India and his voice still rings in our ears. We did not know then\r\nwhat that message was but this we know that the great question which\r\nhad been agitating the mind of our countrymen for many years had also\r\nleft some impression on the minds of our rulers. Gentlemen, after that,\r\nmany proposals have been put forward for the introduction of some kind\r\nof Home Rule or Self-Government in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MONTAGU'S STATEMENT\r\n\r\nBut it was only the other day, I believe on the 20th of August, that\r\nthe statement of the Secretary of State was published. I do not know,\r\ngentlemen, whether you have read that message clearly and carefully.\r\nYou will find in that statement an indication that the message of Hope\r\nwhich was delivered by His Majesty personally is about to be fulfilled.\r\nYou will remember what the Secretary of State says in that statement\r\nthat some kind of responsible government is to be granted to this\r\ncountry. Gentlemen, I will not deal with that in detail, as I had dealt\r\nwith it yesterday at Mymensingh.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VICEROY'S SPEECH\r\n\r\nBut I cannot help repeating one thing before you _viz._, that precisely\r\nthe same message, the same indication is to be found in the speech of\r\nHis Excellency the Viceroy which was delivered in early September.\r\nThere, His Excellency clearly lays down that there are three ways in\r\nwhich the work of Self-Government in this country must be commenced.\r\nThe first method is the institution of Local Self-Government. Now when\r\nany question of local self-government is discussed, and we are apt to\r\nignore its importance; it does not catch our imagination; we do not\r\nattach that interest to it which the question deserves. And whatever\r\nthe kind of self-government you succeed in obtaining--and I am sure we\r\nwill obtain some substantial measure of self-government--be sure that\r\nour national work for the next 20 years to come will be in the field\r\nOf local self-government more than any other. The second road, His\r\nExcellency said, must be the filling up of the public offices in this\r\ncountry with more Indians and the third road was by the introduction\r\nof some kind of responsible Legislative Councils--and gentlemen, to\r\nallay your suspicions--I must confess, we are somewhat suspicious at\r\ntimes--His Excellency said clearly that all this work is to be carried\r\non simultaneously. So, gentlemen, according to His Excellency, you\r\nwill not be relegated merely to Local Self-Government for many years\r\nto come but along with the development of local self-Government you\r\nmay expect, according to the message of His Excellency, a Legislative\r\nCouncil which is at once representative and responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"RESPONSIBILITY IN POLITICS\"\r\n\r\nDo not forget, gentlemen, that the word, \"responsibility\" has got\r\na technical meaning in politics. It does not imply merely moral\r\nresponsibility. It means that the Government must be responsible to\r\nthe people of the country, to the electors, i.e., the Legislative\r\nCouncils will be elected by the people of the country--whatever the\r\nextent of the franchise may be, that is a matter of detail which has\r\ngot to be discussed and no doubt considered carefully. But whatever be\r\nthe electorate, it is that electorate which will elect members of the\r\nLegislative Councils and the Executive Councils will be either elected\r\nor taken from the Legislative Councils and the Executive Councils will\r\nbe responsible not to any outside authority but to the Legislative\r\nCouncils from which they will be taken and thus ultimately to the\r\npeople. These are the indications that I find in the statement of the\r\nSecretary of State as also in the message of the Viceroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-GOVERNMENT FROM MANY VIEW-POINTS\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, that the people of this country has got the right\r\nnow, to expect some kind of responsible self-government in this country\r\nand the time has come when we must shake off our apathy and devote\r\nour entire energies to the consideration of the question as to the\r\nprecise form of self-government that we want in this country. The\r\nquestion is a very difficult one and has got to be discussed from a\r\ngreat many points. We have got to consider it from the point of view\r\nof our nationality, I mean provincial nationality. We have got to\r\nconsider this question from a wider outlook. We cannot forget that we\r\nlive and have been living for many years in the midst of an empire.\r\nWe cannot forget that the different provinces in India are gradually\r\ncoming closer to one another and a new nationality which expresses not\r\nonly the different provinces but the whole of India is growing up in\r\nour midst and we cannot forget that our interests, even our selfish\r\ninterests, our hopes, our ambitions are indissolubly connected with the\r\ninterest of the empire. These are all the considerations before us.\r\nWhen we sit down to frame a scheme we cannot lose sight of any one of\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL AUTONOMY\r\n\r\nIf you consider what is the kind of self-government which is exactly\r\nnecessary for us, what is the first point which suggests itself to\r\nyou! I will tell you what suggests itself to me. The first thing is\r\nprovincial autonomy. I desire to explain that expression clearly as\r\nfar as I understand it, because that expression has been used by many\r\nGovernment officials and by great thinkers in Europe. But I desire\r\nyou to approach this question not at all from the European point of\r\nview, so far as conception is concerned, but from our own national\r\nstandpoint. What is the exact meaning of provincial autonomy? I say\r\nthat the meaning of that expression is that people who have for\r\nhundreds and hundreds of years been living in Bengal have come under\r\nthe sway of a particular culture, have been animated by a particular\r\ngenius and the provincial government which will be established in\r\nBengal must give the fullest expression to that ideal. I mean that the\r\nHindus have, for several centuries been living in Bengal and amongst\r\nthem there have grown up a very great culture which has made itself\r\nfelt in the domain of science, philosophy, religion, literature and\r\nart. It has got a cast of its own; it has got a spirit of its own; it\r\nhas got a distinct individuality.\r\n\r\nWhen I am speaking of the Hindus of Bengal, I am at once reminded\r\nof the Mahomedans of Bengal. They have also lived in Bengal; they\r\nhave lived with us, by our side and have been surrounded by the same\r\nenvironments and whatever our religious differences may be, there can\r\nhardly be any question that their interests and our interests, in point\r\nof education, in point of culture, and in point of nationality are the\r\nsame. When I am speaking of provincial autonomy, I am not forgetting\r\nany community or the members of any particular religion. I want to\r\ninclude the whole of them and I say, taking the whole of them, there is\r\na distinct individuality of Bengal. It is on that individual nature\r\nthat we must take our stand.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, provincial government must be so formed that it will\r\nnot lose the particular interest which that individuality requires.\r\nThe people of Bengal must realise that the whole of their political\r\nenfranchisement must be based upon their ancient ideals and traditions,\r\nenlarged no doubt, developed no doubt, modernised no doubt, but still\r\nbased on those ancient ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORROWING IDEALS FROM EUROPE\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who will borrow all our ideals from Europe. All\r\nmy life, I have protested against it, I protest against it again and I\r\nshall protest against it so long as I live. I am not unmindful of the\r\ngreat culture of Europe. I am not slow in recognising my indebtedness\r\nto it but I cannot forget my own individuality. I cannot forget the\r\nspirit of Bengal which pervades every thought that I entertain, every\r\nhope that I cherish, every fear that I have, and so long as I live,\r\nI promise before you to-day that I will devote my life to work out\r\nthe salvation of the ideal of Bengal. The soul of Bengal had been\r\nsleeping for years but directly Self-government is given to us, that\r\nsoul, while living in an atmosphere of freedom, will make its enormous\r\nclaim to give the fullest expression to its ideal. I feel sure that\r\nthe Government cannot but grant us that opportunity--as I hope, the\r\nGovernment will. Gentlemen, I believe that Bengal has a message to\r\ngive. I feel sure that the day is not distant when the message of\r\nBengal will be delivered and the world will listen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL TO BE WORKED OUT\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, this is the ideal of provincial autonomy and how has\r\nthis ideal to be worked out in practice? We must not rest content with\r\nexpressing our ideal. We must at once sit down to work to execute that\r\nideal. How do you propose to do it? Different schemes have been put\r\nforward. There is the scheme of the 19 members, there is the scheme of\r\nthe Congress and the Moslem League. There is the scheme of the late Mr.\r\nGokhale. I do not desire to criticise those schemes because it is the\r\nuniversal desire of all our leaders that every district ought to form\r\nits own committee to frame its scheme and there should be a conference\r\nin Calcutta, where the representatives from all these districts will\r\nmeet to discuss and deliberate on those schemes, and finally the scheme\r\nwhich is to be presented to the Congress and the League and to the\r\nSecretary of State, should be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROCHIAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nI do not propose to discuss that in detail at all, but I desire to\r\nimpress upon you that whatever the scheme you may be pleased to frame,\r\nyou must not lose sight of what is called parochial politics. From\r\ntime immemorial the village has been the unit of our national life.\r\nYou must consider the reconstruction of our village life, you must\r\nconsider the education of our villagers. You must consider the question\r\nas to how they may be represented in the district association, which\r\nwill be formed with representatives sent by them and you must so frame\r\nyour scheme--I am merely telling you as to what my individual opinion\r\nis--you must so frame it that the interest of what is called parochial\r\ngovernment may not in any way suffer from what may be called the\r\ninterest of the provincial government. Let the village be so connected\r\nwith the province that it may not be felt as an obstruction but as\r\na real and integral part of the province. Then in considering the\r\nrepresentation to the Legislative Council, you will try to so frame\r\nyour scheme that the interest of the poorest villager as well as that\r\nof the richest zemindar may be equally represented; and the interest of\r\nthe minority may not be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGE OF ILLITERACY\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it has been said, and often said by Anglo-Indians that the\r\ngreat majority of our people are so ignorant, are so illiterate that\r\nthey cannot be trusted with votes. I do not know, gentlemen, what\r\nconclusion you will arrive at, but so far as my own view is concerned,\r\nI do not at all agree with that. I do not think that illiteracy and\r\nwant of education are exactly the same thing. As I know my villagers, I\r\nknow this that they may be trusted, with the duty of electing persons\r\nto represent them in the Legislative Councils. You are more in touch\r\nwith the villagers than I am--I have seen some of it, but I feel sure\r\nthat you have got a far more intimate knowledge. I ask you to say\r\nwhether this is correct that our villager is so ignorant, though he\r\nmay not be able to read or write, that he does not know between a bad\r\nman and a good man, between a man who will be able to represent his\r\ninterests properly and a man who will not. I do not think so. And in\r\nany scheme which you may draw up, you must make that perfectly clear. I\r\nam speaking to this because there is a danger. I do not desire that the\r\nmistakes of English history should be repeated in this country. There\r\nis no necessity for it. There is no necessity for starting with a very\r\nlimited franchise and then extending it or having to extend it by civil\r\nwar afterwards. The history of the Reform Bill in England ought not to\r\nbe repeated in this country. So, your scheme should be so framed that\r\nit must carry within itself the possibility of improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThat is, roughly speaking, my idea of the provincial government. I said\r\nthat the first thing which should strike us is provincial autonomy.\r\nBut do not forget that there is a wider interest to consider. These\r\nprovincial governments must be bound together by a Central Government.\r\nI believe it was John Bright who said that the future of India was the\r\nUnited States of India. So far as idea is concerned, it is a grand idea\r\nand the idea of provincial autonomy to which I have referred is part\r\nof that ideal. But John Bright went further; he said that the several\r\nprovincial governments should be connected with the British Parliament.\r\nTo that view I do not assent because the result of that would be that\r\nthe wider interest of Indian nationality would be overlooked. So we\r\nwant a central government. What the character of that government is\r\nto be, must also be considered i.e. how they could have most fully\r\nrepresented all the provincial governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPERIAL FEDERATED GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the third need which you must not forget is the need of\r\nanother Imperial Federated Government to which all the governments of\r\nthe empire should belong--a Government to which the English Government\r\nshould belong as one unit, the Indian Government should belong as\r\nanother, the Government of Africa, Australia and Canada should belong\r\nas other units. It will be a sort of federated Parliament. I ask you\r\nto consider the grand ideal which is contained in that proposal. I do\r\nnot think in the history of the world there ever was another instance\r\nof an empire so vast of an empire, in which so many different races and\r\nnationalities and creeds were represented. When you consider all this,\r\nyou will find what a grand opportunity there is within the British\r\nEmpire of fulfilling that yet still grander ideal of the federation\r\nof the human race. If the federation of the human race is not always\r\nto remain the poet's dream, if it is ever to be fulfilled, I feel sure\r\nthat fulfilment will come through the federation of this vast empire,\r\nto which we have the honour to belong.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD OF ADVICE\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, that is the ideal I put before you and I ask you to\r\nconsider all this in the scheme which you will frame. But there is one\r\nthing to which I desire to draw your attention and it is this; that\r\nin framing this scheme you must not be swayed by a feeling that the\r\nGovernment will not grant this, the Government will not grant that.\r\nWhat the Government will grant and what the Government will not grant,\r\nthat is the business of the Government. We have got only to consider\r\nwhat is necessary for our national well-being. We have no doubt got\r\nto consider the question of our capacity, but we have got to consider\r\nwhat is necessary for our national well being and if you find that\r\ncertain steps are absolutely necessary for our national development, do\r\nnot fail, gentlemen, to put that down in your scheme out of timidity.\r\nI ask you not to be timid. Do not be foolhardy, but there is no\r\nnecessity of being afraid of putting forward the whole of your scheme\r\nbefore the Government. People who are afraid to ask do not deserve.\r\nWhy should we be afraid to tell the Government that a certain scheme\r\nof self-government is necessary for our well-being. The Government\r\ninvites your opinion. The British Government has declared its policy;\r\nthe Viceroy has asked you to consider the scheme and do not, for God's\r\nsake, spoil that by timidity. Say, there are five items, all of which\r\nwe want; but let us not ask 2 or 3 of these because the Government\r\nwill not grant all. I say it is no business of ours and I do not think\r\nthat at the present moment when the Government is full of that truly\r\nimperial idea, when the King's ministers have declared the policy\r\nof the Government to grant to this country some kind of responsible\r\nself-government, I do not think any scheme which is reasonable, any\r\nscheme which is necessary will be refused.\r\n\r\nWhat, if it is refused? Have we not to carry on this fight from year to\r\nyear, supposing the whole of it is not granted to-day. Have we not to\r\nplace that scheme before the public--have we not to fight for it year\r\nto year, giving the whole of our attention, devoting the whole of our\r\nenergy to that, and go on fighting till victory is ours? I have seen\r\na great many schemes fail because of our timidity. I ask you to be on\r\nyour guard because the present is the most opportune moment, because\r\nthe Government has invited your opinion and in giving your opinion\r\ndo not think that we ought not to put this or that down because the\r\nGovernment will not accept this.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE WHOLE OF THE IDEAL\r\n\r\nLet us fight for the whole of our ideal. Let us start with this that\r\nevery cultivator here in this country has got the capacity to judge as\r\nto who his representative is going to be. Let us start with this that\r\nwe can if we only try, if we will only shake off our apathy, do the\r\nwork of local self-government without the intervention of Government\r\nofficials. Let us think of this that we are in a position to so form\r\nour Legislative Councils, by sending Proper representatives there, that\r\nthey will carry out our mandate, that they will carry out our ideal and\r\nthey would elect such an executive that they will do the work which the\r\ncountry requires. Indicate in our scheme how the Provincial Governments\r\nwill have to be connected with a Central Government. But so far as\r\nprovincial autonomy is concerned, so far as the different departments\r\nof the Executive Government in Bengal are concerned, I should not\r\nhesitate to ask for the whole of those powers being transferred to the\r\npeople of Bengal. Naturally, the Indian Government will retain some\r\npowers and I admit it is right that they should retain some powers\r\nnow at this stage for the task of uniting the different provinces in\r\nimperial matters for the purpose of directing the foreign policy and\r\nmilitary affairs of the country. But I insist upon you, I implore you,\r\nthat whatever scheme you may frame, you will not lose sight of the idea\r\nthat we are capable of governing Bengal, we are capable of carrying on\r\nthe work which the Executive Council in Bengal does.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEM TO BLAME\r\n\r\nGentlemen, our requirements will not be met by the introduction of a\r\nfew more of our countrymen into the Civil Service. My quarrel as I said\r\nelsewhere, is not with individuals. There are Civil Servants who are\r\nhonourable men, good men, true men; there may be again those who are\r\nnot so good--but that would happen in every community. My quarrel is\r\nnot with the individual at all. My quarrel is with the system. It is\r\nthe system which is responsible for the bad government of this country.\r\nWhy is the system bad? It is for this--that there is no responsibility.\r\nAn English friend of mine has pointed out that. What are the Civil\r\nServants to do? They are not responsible to the people. They have to\r\ntake their orders from the Executive Council of Bengal. To whom are\r\nthe members of the Executive Council responsible? Not to the people.\r\nThey have got to take their orders from the Government of India. To\r\nwhom is the Government of India responsible? Not to the people. They\r\nhave got to take their orders from the British Parliament. Has the\r\nBritish Parliament got any time to devote to India? Or to make that\r\nresponsibility real? No. My English friend says: they have not. They\r\nhave neglected India not out of apathy but because their own interest\r\nrequired it--they are to discuss so many questions which are of far\r\ngreater importance to England than the question of India. So you get a\r\nstate of things in this country, where the Civil Service, the Executive\r\nCouncil, the Government of Bengal and the Government of India are not\r\nresponsible to anybody. And under such circumstances, good government\r\nis impossible. That is why the Bureaucracy has failed and that is\r\nwhy the Bureaucracy has got to be removed by the introduction of\r\nsome sort of responsible government--that is why the British Cabinet\r\nhas suggested the introduction of responsible government. There is\r\nno further any question of the failure of the Bureaucracy--that is\r\naccepted as a fact, accepted as a fact by people who have the right\r\nto know, by people--not ourselves--but people who have the capacity\r\nto judge, by people who have political insight and wisdom to come to\r\na correct conclusion. We ought not to waste our energy any more in\r\ndiscussing the question whether this Bureaucracy has succeeded or\r\nwhether it has failed. It is an accepted fact that it has failed.\r\n\r\nThe question now is what is the Government that we ought to have. What\r\nis the exact character of the representation which we ought to obtain\r\nand, gentlemen, I also ask you to consider another thing carefully. In\r\nframing the scheme, do not be carried away by mere clamour. It does\r\nnot matter at all whether your Legislative consists of 100 members or\r\nwhether it consists of 300 members. It does not matter at all whether\r\nthe Executive Council will contain two more Indians. What is necessary\r\nto consider is how to make the Legislative Council responsible to\r\nthe people, how to make the Executive Council responsible to the\r\nLegislative Council and how to make this responsible government express\r\nthe true ideal of the people of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME RULE MEETING AT BARISAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_A largely attended meeting, presided over by Babu Nibaran Chandra Das\r\nGupta, was held at the Raja Bahadur's Haveli, Barisal, on 14th October\r\n1917, when Mr. C. R. Das spoke as follows:--_\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen,--I thank you very much for the kind words\r\nthat have been said of me this afternoon. I wish I could say that I\r\nfully deserve all the kind things which have been said about me by\r\nyour worthy Chairman. But I will not waste your time by expressing\r\nmy modesty. I accept this welcome in all humility. I feel in a way\r\nto-night which I never felt before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORY OF BARISAL CONFERENCE RECALLED\r\n\r\nWhen I stand here before you, I feel I am standing on a sacred soil.\r\nTo every Nationalist of Bengal, Barisal is a place of pilgrimage. Here\r\nit was that our friend and guru Babu Aswini Kumar Dutt (cheers) has\r\npassed the best years of his life in the service of the people of this\r\ncountry and in awakening within them the spirit of nationality in\r\nthe true light of spirituality. Here it was, gentlemen, that we met\r\nat one of the most memorable conferences that took place in Bengal, I\r\nmean the Provincial Conference in which we came into conflict with the\r\nExecutive. I cannot efface from my mind the memory of that meeting. The\r\nsong of Bande Mataram had been sung before in Bengal but never in that\r\nsignificant way as it was done on that memorable occasion. I remember\r\nthe conference vividly, the march from this very place to the hall\r\nof the conference, the illegal orders that were passed, the illegal\r\narrests that were made, and the voice of the people triumphing over all\r\nthose illegal attempts on the part of the Executive. Gentlemen, that\r\nsurely was a landmark in the history of Nationalism and if I have come\r\nbefore you to-night to speak of the most momentous question which is\r\nagitating the whole country, it is only meet that you should remember\r\nthe struggles, the glorious fight, the unselfish work and activities of\r\nour leaders which have brought us to this state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-GOVERNMENT AND HOME RULE MEAN THE SAME THING\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, the question of all questions which we desire to\r\ndiscuss and consider is the question of Self-Government or Home\r\nRule or Swaraj. Both these are mere names. Bombay may call it\r\nSwaraj; Madras may call it Home Rule and again Bengal may call it\r\nSelf-Government--but all these expressions mean the same thing, the\r\nsame ideal. Once we understand the ideal clearly there will be no\r\nfurther differences as to what it means and what it implies.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE GROWTH OF NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN BENGAL\r\n\r\nBut before we try to understand the ideal of Self-Government it is as\r\nwell to take a bird's eye view of the modern history of Bengal which\r\nbears upon that momentous question. I shall not weary you by a detailed\r\nanalysis of that history. But I shall place before you as briefly as I\r\ncan the landmarks, as it were of that history within which Nationalism\r\nwas in the making, within which our self-consciousness was growing and\r\nwhich has led us to the present day when the whole country is demanding\r\nin one voice, as it were, some sort of responsible self-government.\r\nIf you do not understand the trend of events and incidents which have\r\nled up to this consciousness of nationalism, I am afraid you will\r\nmiss much that is important to know. Gentlemen, when we talk of the\r\nmodern history of Bengal, we have to begin with Rajah Ram Mohan Roy\r\n(cheers). He was from that point of view, the founder of modern Bengal\r\nalthough I admit that the life work of this great man has got to be\r\nre-estimated, revalued, re-understood and reinterpreted. There is no\r\ndoubt that he was the first who held before us the ideal of freedom.\r\nHe was the first to sound the note of freedom in every department of\r\nlife and in all different cultures that have met to-day in India. It\r\nmay be, we have to modify that, it may be we have to analyse that more\r\ncarefully and more in details for the purpose of scientific study\r\nbut it is enough for our purpose to say that he inaugurated many\r\nreforms--you might call that reforming activity. He inaugurated the\r\nreforms which again, in turn, gave rise to reaction which, again, gave\r\nrise to further reforms which made the nation turn on itself till at\r\nlast, it began to be self-conscious. I do not admit that in the days\r\nof the Rajah the nation was self-conscious, but he put before us just\r\nthe sort of thing which would have helped the immediate awakening of\r\nthe national consciousness. We cannot but pay homage to that great\r\ngenius, who, first of all, sounded the note of freedom in politics as\r\nwell as in other spheres of life. After the death of Rajah Ram Mohan\r\nRoy, the work of reform was naturally taken up by the Brahmo Samaj\r\nand although a section of our educated people followed the movement,\r\nit was principally led by the Brahmo Samaj. That movement was nothing\r\nbut sounding the same note of freedom, though the ideal of freedom and\r\nculture was borrowed from European culture and civilization. With Ram\r\nMohan Roy it was the extension and the Europeanisation of our cultural\r\nsystems. The same ideal was applied by the Brahmo Samaj to different\r\nparts, different provinces of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKIM DISCOVERS THE SOUL OF BENGAL\r\n\r\nSide by side and almost in parallel lines with that, was another\r\nactivity which is to be found in the literature of Bengal and\r\nprincipally I refer to the writings of Bankim. You will find that\r\nwhereas our activity in the domain of reforms followed the European\r\nideals and was a great deal more and more European in its tendencies,\r\nthe writings of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee shows a different tendency\r\naltogether: (A voice: of Bhudeb?)--and, as I am reminded, also in the\r\nwritings of Bhudeb--in their writings an attempt was made, though it\r\nwas not perfect by any means, still an attempt, an honest and sincere\r\nattempt was made to discover the soul of Bengal. In that period of\r\nour literary history you will find the glorification of Bengal.\r\nBengal was held up as mother and with him. Durga was nothing but the\r\npersonification, as it were, of Bengal; and in other writings of\r\nhis you will find an attempt is made to depict though in a somewhat\r\nsuperficial way our national life, to dive deep into the history of\r\nour people, into the instincts and culture of our people and find\r\nout that which is truly Bengalee and not that which is imported from\r\nEurope. All this was in the literature, brewing as it were, and growing\r\nin the literature of Bengal but the activities, political and social,\r\nwere of a different character. I do not know whether it is the result\r\nof that literature but gradually it gave rise to an agitation which\r\nit is difficult to describe--I mean the reactionary agitation of\r\nSashadhar and his friends. That was a blind movement, an irrational\r\nmovement it may be, but none the less it was a landmark in the history\r\nof the progress of Nationalism. There also you will find the nation\r\nbegan to turn on itself, the nation began to criticise the wealth of\r\nculture which was brought from Europe.--Look at it carefully, keenly\r\nand try to judge its real value to the people of this country. It was\r\nnot a rational movement--it started with a hatred of things European,\r\nirrational hatred of everything European--but none the less it was a\r\ngenuine and sincere movement. I desire to be very brief because I am\r\nafraid I am tiring you out (Cries of No. No.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MESSAGE OF THE GREAT SWAMI\r\n\r\nThat movement again in its turn gave rise to the movement of the late\r\nSwami Vivekananda. All that was narrow in the movement of Shashadhar\r\nwas widened, a more liberal note was sounded. The national spirit\r\nof which the first note was heard in the movement of Sashadhar, was\r\ndeveloped by Swami Vivekananda and in his hands it became a trumpet,\r\nI am not saying that the message of the Swami was the final word in\r\nour nationalism. It was somewhat abstract in so far as it was more\r\nIndian than Bengalee. But it was tremendous--something with an undying\r\nglory all its own. If you read his books, if you read his lectures,\r\nyou are struck at once with his patriotism, love of country, not that\r\nabstract patriotism which came to us from Europe but of a different\r\nnature altogether a more living thing, something which we feel within\r\nourselves when we read his writings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWADESHI MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nI now pass on to another phase of this national history, that is, the\r\ngreat Swadeshi movement. It really began in 1902. It was intensified in\r\n1905; it went on and I believe, it is still going on. That movement was\r\ninaugurated by the same spirit of nationalism made broader, perhaps a\r\nlittle selfish--all national claims begin in national selfishness but\r\nmade more real. Bengal, for the first time, in those days, realised the\r\ngreat soul within her. At that time we became fully conscious so far\r\nas Bengal is concerned. We turned to the country, the whole of Bengal\r\nbecame to us the symbol of the soul of Bengal. Many of you, gentlemen,\r\nmust have lived through that period, must have taken part in the many\r\nactivities of that period and I ask you to say if you ever felt the\r\npulse of the people of Bengal beat so clearly as you did in those days.\r\n(Hear, hear) I say before that movement all other movements were more\r\nor less borrowed because before that the soul of Bengal was hidden from\r\nus. For the first time in the history of our national life that soul\r\nbegan to reveal herself and we were struck with the glory and majesty\r\nof it. This period of our national life is remarkable for the writings\r\nof Rabindra Nath Tagore (Cheers) and of Bepin Chandra Pal, of D. L. Roy\r\n(Cheers) and many others. But at that time our idea of nationalism was\r\ncentred in Bengal. We never looked beyond Bengal, we were looking at\r\nBengal, we were drinking of Bengal, as it were; and of course, we were\r\nenraptured, as all lovers are.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, the nationalism of to-day is wider than that. We have\r\nlived to grow and we discover that although the soul of Bengal must\r\ndirect all our activities that although the soul of Bengal must find\r\nits fullest expression in every work in which we engage yet there is a\r\nwider outlook which cannot be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MAHOMEDANS\r\n\r\nBefore I come to deal with that I should draw your attention to\r\nanother significant fact and that is, the gradual awakening of\r\nthe consciousness of the Mahomedan community of Bengal (cheers).\r\nAt the time of the Swadeshi agitation we were held apart. The\r\nself-consciousness which grew within us--the soul of Bengal which\r\nrevealed herself to us, did not reveal herself to the Mahomedans and we\r\nfound that they were banded together against this national activity;\r\nbut, gentlemen, do not be disappointed. You have to view the awakening\r\nof the political consciousness of the Mahomedans in Bengal in its true\r\nhistorical perspective, otherwise you will lose sight of much that is\r\nimportant. If you will allow me, I will tell you very briefly something\r\nabout that history. The literature which would show the wonderful\r\nactivities of the Mahomedans of Bengal has not yet been unearthed but\r\nI have not the least doubt that one day you will find that literature\r\nin which both Hindus and Mahomedans joined. Hindus writing in Urdu\r\nand Bengalee Mahomedans writing in Sanskrit--I have seen one or two\r\nsuch manuscripts and I am sure there are many such--and when all that\r\nliterature is unearthed, you will find a wonderful history of Bengalee\r\ncivilization. In the days of Ram Mohan Roy when English education was\r\nintroduced in this country, the Mahomedans did not accept it. I am\r\nnot sorry for that. The Mahomedans did not accept it and they were\r\nwaiting for a ruder shock. They had forgotten what their forefathers\r\nhad done in the way of national development. They did not accept\r\nEnglish education and at the same time they were divorced from the\r\nculture which their fathers had advanced. The result was that whereas\r\nthe Hindus got on in life, got into government employment, got many\r\nthings which people value in life, the Mahomedans were left without\r\nit and gradually there came to be a sort of estrangement between the\r\ntwo nationalities at the time of the Swadeshi movement. They kept\r\naway from that movement and even fought with their might and main\r\nagainst it. Now, gentlemen, I told you I am not sorry for that. I do\r\nnot remember how I felt it then but now I see that the very attitude\r\nwhich the Mahomedans had taken, that very opposition was the result of\r\ntheir national awakening. We used to deprecate the work of the late\r\nNabob Salimulla in those days because he had organised the Mahomedan\r\nopposition to the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. I do not do that now\r\nbecause whatever the form of that activity might have been, Nabob\r\nSalimulla succeeded in organising the Mahomedans (cheers). The spirit\r\nof nationality spoke amongst the Mahomedans at that time. Once the name\r\nis roused I do not care how it is roused. Let it be roused once and\r\nthen all its narrowness will pass away. All that is true forms part of\r\nthe national consciousness. What is the result to-day? I went to Dacca\r\nand the Mahomedans invited me to an informal conference. When I went\r\nthere what did I find? Not that estrangement but an intense anxiety\r\non their part to side with the Hindus to combine with the Hindus,\r\n(cheers) to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Hindus for working out\r\nthe real salvation of Bengal (Loud applause). If the Swadeshi Movement\r\nwas the first step in our national self-consciousness so far as Hindus\r\nare concerned, I say it was equally the first step of Mahomedan\r\nself-consciousness. Its appearance was against the nation, but its\r\nreality was in our favour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MESSAGE OF NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the message of nationality, as I said before has a wider\r\noutlook to-day. We cannot forget that we are living within an empire,\r\nperhaps the vastest, the largest and the most glorious empire in the\r\nhistory of mankind. We cannot forget that however truly national we may\r\nbe--and we ought to be national--under no circumstances should we be\r\ndivested of our own individuality and I say the Hindus and Mahomedans\r\nof Bengal, living together side by side for so many generations,\r\nimbibing each other's culture, surrounded by the same atmosphere,\r\nthe same climate, influenced by the same culture, the two together\r\nform the real Bengalee nation. Although we should not lose our own\r\nindividuality, the spirit of isolation is not the best thing in\r\nnational life and philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE MUST REACH OUT TO THE WORLD\r\n\r\nWe ought to stand on our own individuality in all the glory which that\r\nindividuality implies but at the same time we must emerge from that\r\nand with the fullest consciousness of ourselves we should reach out to\r\nthe world. That is the true philosophy of our nationality, and if we\r\nare living in an empire to-day, we ought to see that we do not live\r\nself-centred, in the splendid isolation of our own individuality. We\r\nought to give the fullest expression to our individuality but we ought\r\nto do something more than that. We ought to reach out to the world\r\nand how do we reach out to the world? It is by taking our legitimate\r\npart in the empire. We should hold fast to this that our individuality\r\nshould be kept absolutely distinct, I should not give that up for the\r\nwhole world for if we give that up, we cease to be ourselves, (hear,\r\nhear.) But stand on that as we must, we must stretch out our hands\r\nacross to the world. That we can only do by taking our legitimate part\r\nin the activities of this great empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL AUTONOMY--THE FIRST STEP\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the first step in the region of ideal is perfect provincial\r\nautonomy. Let us take Bengal. Any form of self-government that we can\r\ndemand from this point of view must be a government which will secure\r\nthe autonomy of the Bengalee nation. Then you must not forget that\r\napart from the individuality of Bengal, India as a whole has got a\r\nspecial individuality of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN NATIONALITY--THE SECOND STEP\r\n\r\nWe cannot forget that the different nationalities of India, although\r\nthere are differences between them, although they differ from each\r\nother in many respects, yet spiritually and historically they are\r\nbound up as so many links in the chain of one living national\r\nindividuality. We ought not to forget that Bengal, Madras, Bombay\r\nand the Punjab are all dominated by one great central culture. The\r\nepics of Ramayana and Mahabharata are epics of not only the Punjab,\r\nof Bombay, of Madras but also of Bengal and the rest of India. The\r\ngreat religious institutions are common--I am speaking of the Hindus\r\nonly--to all the provinces, Each province has got a speciality of its\r\nown, I admit, but over and above that all these different provinces are\r\nbound together in one common culture. If we are to hold fast to our\r\nprovincial individuality, we must also see that the great individuality\r\nof India is not lost. At one time the idea was to develop the different\r\nprovinces, making the provinces autonomous and to connect these\r\ndifferent autonomous provinces with the British Parliament. That will\r\nnot work out our ideal--that ideal will not allow the great Indian\r\nnationality to develop and much as I love Bengal and much as I love\r\nmy own individuality, my own provincial individuality, I should be\r\nsorry indeed if any kind of Self-Government is sought to be introduced\r\ninto this country which will greatly injure that great ideal of Indian\r\nNationality. If the whole of the Hindu races are bound up in that way,\r\nyou must also realise that the whole of the Mahomedan races all over\r\nIndia is also similarly bound up together and you must not forget that\r\nthe two great cultures must meet together, and the result will be a\r\ngreat culture which is not purely Hindu, not purely Mahomedan but\r\nsomething which is made up of the contact of these two great races.\r\nAnd that is the ideal of Indian Nationality which must be preserved\r\nand developed to the fullest extent. If you ask me if I get provincial\r\nSelf-Government in Bengal, why I should trouble myself about this\r\nIndian Nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA MOVING TOWARDS UNITY\r\n\r\nIn answer I say if I have understood the lesson of Indian history\r\ncorrectly, I consider that from ages past there was a movement of\r\nunifying the whole of India and I think through the many vicissitudes\r\nof Indian history, in the time of the Hindus, in the time of Mahomedan\r\nrule and now English rule, throughout the many vicissitudes that\r\none idea stands out prominently viz., with each success, with every\r\nfailure, India was growing more and more and becoming herself. I do not\r\nbelieve that in the old times in the ancient history of our country,\r\nthere ever was one united India--India was never one whole under the\r\nHindus at any time. I hold in great reverence and veneration all the\r\nactivities of ancient India. India was great, but the great Indian\r\nnationality was in the making. We have profited by what was done in the\r\nancient days, we have inherited all their culture but it is for us to\r\nwiden that culture for the evolution of the great Indian nation. That\r\nday, gentlemen, is fast approaching. I ask you to consider critically\r\nthe history of India.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS INDIA EVER ONE WHOLE\r\n\r\nCan you point your finger to any period of Indian history in which\r\nthere was an united India? I have failed to discover it. Take the\r\nMagadh Empire--that great empire which was built up and which perished\r\nin course of time. That empire did not bring out Indian unity to the\r\nfullest extent. Take the Mahomedan Empire--it did not--it strove for\r\nthat and I fully appreciate that, that is the tendency of the Indian\r\nhistory from the earliest time to the present day. (A voice: in the\r\ntime of Asoke?) Even in the time of Asoke there was not one whole\r\nunited India; it was the domination of one country over the rest of\r\nIndia. The great Indian nationality of which I am speaking was not born\r\nthen. I am not for belittling the glory of the culture of India under\r\nthose empires--I have the deepest veneration for them and I say the\r\npurpose of Indian history is that throughout the ages, through every\r\nsuccess, through every failure, through every battle which was won,\r\nthrough every battle which was lost, the history of India was working\r\nout her destiny and turning out the great Indian nation. To-day we\r\nsee the vision of that glory (cheers). That which could not come to\r\npass under the Hindu kings, that which was not brought about under the\r\nMahomedan gentlemen, it is for us to consider now were we who represent\r\nmodern India, whether it will be our glorious task to accomplish that\r\nif we fail--what of that?--others will come after us who will achieve\r\nthis. But achieved it must be (Hear, Hear). The message of India must\r\nbe given to the world.\r\n\r\nThe history of India is working out--is bringing out gradually the soul\r\nof India and the time will come--we may not live then, our children\r\nmay not live then,--but I say the day will come when India will stand\r\nbefore the whole world in all her glory of spirituality. The unity\r\nof the Hindus and the Mahomedans and of all sects and creeds will be\r\nbound together in one great cultural ideal and will influence the\r\ncivilization of the world (Prolonged cheers). Well, gentlemen, as I am\r\ndealing with Self-Government, the point of practical importance which\r\narises is this; that is a scheme of self-government not only should\r\nthere be perfectly autonomous provincial government but along that such\r\na scheme should be made that all these provincial governments may be\r\nunited in one central Indian Government because in this our desire for\r\nprovincial autonomy, we are apt to forget the spirit of the history of\r\nIndia. That is the spirit of nationalism to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE EMPIRE THE THIRD STEP\r\n\r\nBut what of the nationalism of to-morrow?--You have to think of the\r\nwhole human race, and gradually, some sort of a federal government\r\nmust be established. It may not be in a few years. It may be a long\r\ntime yet but some sort of Government must be established, which may\r\nbe called the Federal government of the whole empire, a government\r\nto which the British Parliament will send their representatives, a\r\ngovernment to which the Indian Government, after it is federated and\r\nafter it is nationalised and after it is made responsible, will also\r\nsend her representatives,--a government to which Australia will send\r\nher representatives--a government to which Africa will also send her\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERATION OF ALL NATIONS THE GOAL\r\n\r\nThat is the future federal government of the British Empire and I say\r\nthat as an ideal, we should cling to that and cling to that because\r\nwe must not forget that the ultimate goal of human activity in every\r\ncountry is what the poet has described, a Parliament of nations, the\r\nfederation of the world. That is an ideal which has got to be worked\r\nout. The time is coming when a definite scheme should be framed to work\r\nout as far as possible this great ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLARATION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, many of you may have read the declaration of Policy issued\r\nby the Secretary of State the other day and may also have read the\r\nspeech of His Excellency the Viceroy made with reference to that.\r\nReading these two statements together, it is clear that the time has\r\ncome when every educated man in this country should set about earnestly\r\nto frame a scheme for the introduction of self-government keeping in\r\nmind the ideal which we have before us and keeping in mind also the\r\nstandard of practical politics. Now, gentlemen, if you have to frame\r\na scheme like that, you will of course take into consideration the\r\nfirst point, _viz._, of provincial autonomy _i.e._, of each province.\r\nLet us think of Bengal at the present moment, Bengal must have a\r\ngovernment which is representative that is to say, the people of Bengal\r\nwill be the electors and they will elect their representative to this\r\nGovernment and the legislative Council is to regulate and control the\r\nexecutive. The Government officials that there are at the present\r\nmoment, will be under the control of that Executive Department or in\r\nother words, every office and the government itself will be responsible\r\nto the people of this country. That is the first point you will have\r\nto consider. You will have to consider how you can bring about these\r\nthings, the particular method according to which this must be worked\r\nout. Now, gentlemen, the second thing that you have to consider is\r\nhow to federate these different provinces and connect them with the\r\nCentral Government. These are the two important points which you have\r\ngot to think about at the present moment and I invite your attention\r\nto a scheme which you must formulate amongst yourself. I have given\r\nyou what my views are but you are not bound by these; you must form a\r\ncommittee of competent men to frame such a scheme and I think all the\r\nrepresentatives of the districts should meet in Calcutta some time in\r\nNovember to discuss the scheme of self-government. We shall then adopt\r\none scheme for Bengal in which the interests of the Hindus and the\r\ninterests of Mahomedans will all be considered and we, the Hindus and\r\nMahomedans of Bengal will present this scheme to the Secretary of State\r\nwhen he arrives here in November or in December.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES AHEAD\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have told you what the ideal is according to my view, and\r\nI ask you to set about working it out. But you must not be negligent\r\nof the difficulties that lie in your way. And the first and foremost\r\nof these difficulties is the agitation of the Anglo-Indians who have\r\nformed themselves into the European Association for the purpose of\r\ntrying their best to defeat the noble object of the Government of India\r\n(Shame, shame). Gentlemen, so far as the Government is concerned,\r\nit has declared its policy openly and clearly and if the European\r\nAssociation sets itself against this noble desire of the Government\r\nof this country it would be our clear duty to stand against the\r\nmischievous activity of the Association. (Hear, hear.) Gentlemen, I\r\nhave dealt with their speeches and the absurdly exaggerated claims\r\nwhich they have made, at other places. I do not desire to repeat them\r\nagain but you will find that these speeches are all couched in violent\r\nlanguage and sobriety and judgment is conspicuous by its absence in\r\nalmost all the utterances made at that meeting in Calcutta.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL RANCOUR\r\n\r\nThey have started this agitation by vilifying our leaders and attacking\r\nboth the ideal and the method of the Home Rule movement of this country\r\nand I charge that the result of that is racial rancour which I say,\r\nit ought to be the endeavour of every honest citizen, be he Indian or\r\nbe he European, or be he Anglo-Indian, to avoid. Gentlemen, I desire\r\nto give you just one or two specimens of that. This is how Sir Archy\r\nBirkmyre speaks of the activities of the people. I quote from his\r\nspeech:--\r\n\r\n \"We should have been content to treat this agitation (i.e., our\r\n agitation) with the contempt it deserves, but we are confronted with\r\n the alarming fact that the Government is hauling down its colours\r\n before these lawless agitators.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this statement professes contempt not only for the\r\nactivities of the people, the unselfish and honest activities of the\r\nleaders of the people of this country but it also professes contempt\r\nfor their own Government, (Cries of shame) as it refers to the actions\r\nof the Government, the noble actions of the Government in these words;\r\n\r\n \"But we are confronted with the alarming fact that the Government is\r\n hauling down its colours before these lawless agitators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARE WE LAWLESS AGITATORS?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, our agitation is described as the agitation of lawless\r\npeople. I read through these speeches very carefully and I challenge\r\nany one of the speakers to find out a single utterance in Mrs.\r\nBeasant's speeches on the question of Home Rule, in her many pamphlets\r\non this subject which may be characterised as violent. I challenge\r\nthem to find out a single sentiment in any one of these utterances of\r\nMrs. Besant which stands for lawlessness. I have read them carefully;\r\nthese Anglo-Indian agitators have not. I have read them carefully and\r\nI say that Mrs. Besant has laid down clearly and emphatically that the\r\nagitation for Home Rule must be carried on lawfully and by the use of\r\nargument not by the use of methods which are against law. She has laid\r\nthat down so often in her speeches that anybody who refers to that\r\nagitation as lawless has no excuse for such ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO ARE VIOLENT--WE OR YOU?\r\n\r\nI will now give you another bit from the same speaker:--\r\n\r\n\"Most of you are aware of the quality or the language used by the\r\nIndian agitator when he wishes to libel British rule.\"\r\n\r\nThe quality of language used by the Indian agitator indeed! Well,\r\ngentlemen, you have read the speeches of these Anglo-Indian agitators\r\nand you have read the speeches of Indians who have addressed the\r\ncountry from time to time on the question of Home Rule. I ask you\r\nto compare the tone of these speeches and I ask you to say who are\r\nviolent--they or we? I will give you one choice bit from Mr. Wigett. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Can any one here say that in releasing Mrs. Besant the Government\r\nof India has exercised that power in a matter that we have a right\r\nto expect.... It is a direct invitation to further noisy and blatant\r\nupheavals of violent passion.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that is the language of moderation. I shall pass by that without\r\na comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SPLENETIC BITTERNESS OF A POLITICAL SECT\"\r\n\r\nI will give you another from this gentleman's speech. Referring to the\r\nwritings of Indians on the question of Home Rule and in support of our\r\nclaim for Home Rule, this gentleman says:--\r\n\r\n\"Such writings do not represent the feelings of the people of Calcutta,\r\nor anything indeed but the splenetic bitterness of a political sect.\"\r\n\r\nThat is very choice language, gentlemen, \"splenetic bitterness of a\r\npolitical sect.\" That is very moderate language indeed! I shall pass by\r\nthis also without any comment. I come now to Mr. F. W. Carter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR \"UNSCRUPULOUS\" METHODS\r\n\r\nReferring to our activity, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Unscrupulous methods and audacious claims of a few noisy agitators.\"\r\n\r\nMark the words--\"unscrupulous methods and audacious claims.\" Our\r\nclaims are audacious because we want to govern ourselves because we\r\nsay that for the last 150 years there has been a bureaucratic form\r\nof government--bureaucracy has been tried and found wanting. This\r\nis an admitted fact now, admitted by politicians in England and by\r\npoliticians in India--admitted by implication in the statement of\r\nthe Secretary of State and the speech of His Excellency the Viceroy.\r\nThat the Bureaucracy will no longer do and because we saw that the\r\nbureaucracy must be replaced by some sort of government which is\r\nself-government and which is responsible to the people of this country.\r\nWe are told of the unscrupulous methods and the audacious claims\r\nof a few noisy agitators. That again is language of moderation and\r\ncalculated to create (A voice: and preserve)--yes and preserve a \"calm\r\natmosphere.\" The idea of these Anglo-Indian agitators is this: that\r\nwhen they speak of us they can use the most violent language, they can\r\nincite racial bitterness, they can say whatever they like with the most\r\nperfect impunity but if any agitators, if any Indian patriot refers in\r\nthe slightest degree to the evils of bureaucratic government in this\r\ncountry, they are at once a noisy lot who must be punished by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDING INSULT TO INJURY\r\n\r\nI give you another passage from Sir Archy Birkmyre again:--\r\n\r\n\"Of the loyalty and devotion of the fighting races of the Punjab,\r\nSir Michael Odwyer has spoken in terms which everyone of us in this\r\nroom will cordially endorse. But the spirit of the Punjab has not\r\nbeen manifested in other provinces.\" Gentlemen, so far as Bengal is\r\nconcerned--and this speaker was speaking amidst Bengalees, so far as\r\nBengal is concerned, I say, for anybody to charge that Bengal has not\r\ncontributed to the war by money or by manpower is a libel on the whole\r\nBengalee race. I say it is adding insult to injury. When did you allow\r\nthe Bengalees to wear arms? When was it for the first time that you\r\ncalled upon them to wear arms and to go and fight our enemy? It was\r\nonly the other day. Do you expect, does any reasonable man who wants\r\nto put forward reasonable argument expect that a whole people who have\r\nsuddenly been called upon to take arms and march against an enemy,\r\nthat they will at once, as if by a magic, turn out a very large army?\r\nWhose is the fault? Is it the fault of Bengal that to-day you do not\r\nfind thousands and thousands, lacs and lacs of Bengalees fighting for\r\nthe empire? Whose is the fault? You deprive them of their arms, you\r\ntell them that they are enemies (shame, shame), you declare to the\r\nworld that they were never fit for military service and when suddenly\r\nyou call upon them to take arms and fight, can anybody say that Bengal\r\nhas not responded to the call sincerely, earnestly and if I may say,\r\nvaliantly? I say a speech of this description is adding insult to\r\ninjury. That is what these speakers say of the people of Bengal. Let me\r\nnow place before you one or two passages which show their attitude to\r\nthe government of this country when the government has resolved upon\r\ndoing justice to the people of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MEDDLING MUDDLERS\"\r\n\r\nI quote from the speech of the Hon. Mr. Ironside. It is rather a long\r\nquotation but I am afraid that I must place this before you to bring\r\nout the quality of Anglo-Indian agitation. I hope you will bear with\r\nme. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, we don't want any from the House of Commons, and I would\r\ncommend this remark to Mr. Montagu, for we distrust them root and\r\nbranch. At this distance we watch the unhealthy game which proceeds at\r\nWestminster and to honest men it is enough to make one weep for one's\r\ncountry; and I think, you will agree with me, gentlemen, that we have\r\nnone of it here. This is no time for meddling, least of all from a\r\nrepresentative of a Ministry who one and all by their words and deeds\r\nbrought the old country to the verge of internal ruin, vilified honest\r\nmen and patriots slithered into unprepared, and having made a mess of\r\neverything have hung on to their self-elected posts like limpets until\r\na second time the destruction of the empire was nearly effected. We are\r\nnot taking the same risk here. Mr. Montagu, I believe, started in a\r\ndepartment created for the definite purpose of helping to win the war.\r\nHad it been of any use, I presume, he would have stayed there but being\r\none of a party of meddling muddlers, he has found his way back to the\r\nIndian Office.\"\r\n\r\nThis is language of moderation applied to the Secretary of State for\r\nIndia who is entrusted by the British Parliament with the government of\r\nthis country. I can assure you gentlemen if anything half as violent\r\nas that had been said by any one of us, this gentleman would have been\r\nfurious and would have exhibited his fury ten times more; and the\r\n\"Statesman\" newspaper would have said that speakers who make use of\r\nsuch language should be punished by the State so that their speeches\r\nmay not create disaffection. But when you call the Secretary of State a\r\nmeddling muddler, I suppose that is allowable. When you heap contempt\r\nupon the whole of the British Parliament, I suppose it is allowable. If\r\nonly an Indian says that the bureaucratic Government has been found to\r\nbe wanting, it has failed in its duties, it has failed in its charge of\r\nthe administration of this country, it is such violent language that\r\nthe State must put down.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLO-INDIANS TEACH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nThen the same speaker goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"You must remember that we have to teach the House of Commons before we\r\ncan gain their ear and support.\"\r\n\r\nI hope the House of Commons will be enlightened by the lessons which it\r\ngets from speakers of this description. (Loud laughter).\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO BRINGS GOVERNMENT TO CONTEMPT\r\n\r\nTo turn again to Mr. Wigget--he says:--\r\n\r\n\"What an extraordinary spectacle!\" referring to the release of Mrs.\r\nBesant and the regret expressed by Sir Michael O'Dwyer,\r\n\r\n'Of a sentimental weak-kneed Government'\r\n\r\nIf this is not showing contempt for the Government I do not know what\r\ncontempt is. This is not all: there is an alarming fact expressed in\r\nsome of these speeches. Some of the speakers have stated that the civil\r\nservants and the military officers are entirely in sympathy with them\r\nin their resistance to any kind of self-government being granted to\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THE MEMBERS OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY SERVICES WITH ANGLO-INDIANS?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I shall place before you one passage from the speech of Mr.\r\nCarter and another from the speech of Sir A. W. Binning.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter says:--\r\n\r\n\"I appeal, therefore, to the Government on behalf of all Europeans\r\nwhether engaged in trade and commerce or serving in Government\r\nemployment.... I assure the Government that they are here in spirit.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the Civil Servants were present in spirit at this meeting\r\naccording to the statement of Mr. Carter! (Laughter).\r\n\r\nAnd the other speaker says this:--\r\n\r\n\"Our claims, as put forward at present, will have the silent, but none\r\nthe less effective, support of the Indian Civil Service and Military\r\nofficers whose lot is cast in this country and who equally with us,\r\nview with grave apprehension the measures which we fear, on effort will\r\nbe made to force on us.\"\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen that is absolutely startling. For myself, I refuse to\r\nbelieve this. I refuse to believe that the members of the civil service\r\nand the military officers who are servants of the King should so far\r\nforget themselves that they should express their sympathy with these\r\nAnglo-Indian agitators, express their views to them against the policy\r\nwhich has been declared by His Majesty's Government. I say, I refuse to\r\nbelieve this because if it were true, it discloses an alarming state\r\nof things. It shows this: that whatever the policy of the British\r\nGovernment may be, whatever the policy and the declaration of His\r\nMajesty's Government may be, His Majesty's servants in India may so\r\ncombine and may so actively oppose people who stand up for that policy\r\nas perhaps to render that policy nugatory. I say, if it is true, it\r\ndiscloses an alarming state of things and I hope the Government will\r\ntake note of the speeches and make an enquiry into this and if there is\r\nany truth in this statement, I ask the Government why should they allow\r\ntheir own servants to so conduct themselves as to represent unnecessary\r\nopposition to the declared policy of the Government, (Hear hear).\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS ANGLO-INDIANS CLAIM\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, I have referred to the speeches to show to you how\r\nunreasonable in spirit, how violent in language those speeches were.\r\nBut what is their claim? Why is it that just after the declaration\r\nof this policy by the Secretary of State in August and the speech of\r\nthe Viceroy in September that they should assemble in a meeting and\r\noppose that policy tooth and nail. The declaration contained only this:\r\nthat some sort of responsible government is to be introduced in this\r\ncountry--nothing beyond that. Why is it that all the Anglo-Indians\r\ngathered together and began to denounce that policy before the details\r\nare published or worked out? What is the claim which they make? I shall\r\nread to you from the speech of Sir Archy Birkmyre which puts forward\r\nwhat that claim is. This worthy gentleman says:\r\n\r\n\"The greater part of the commerce of India the basis of her prosperity\r\nis controlled and financed by Britishers.\"\r\n\r\nMark the word gentlemen, \"Britishers\" not the Anglo-Indian community\r\nalone but the Britishers. He goes on:\r\n\r\n\"All the progress that India has made in recent generations is due\r\nalmost entirely to British direction, British capital and British\r\nenterprise. The men who are responsible for the vast interests created\r\nby the British in India cannot sit down voiceless and idle when the\r\ndanger confronts us that these interests will be sacrificed to appease\r\nthe political appetites of mob orators and Home Rulers.\"\r\n\r\nDoes it stand to this that the introduction of any kind of\r\nself-government in this country, however safeguarded the different\r\ninterests may be, means such a disregard of the interests of these\r\nAnglo-Indian Agitators that the Government must be forced to give\r\nup its honest desire of introducing such a government? I ask in all\r\nseriousness does the claim go so far as this?--The Anglo-Indian claim\r\nwhich is put forward at this meeting does it go so far to insist\r\nthat no kind of self-government, however limited it may be, however\r\nsafeguarded the different interests in the country may be, that no\r\nkind of self-government is to be introduced at all into this country\r\nbecause these Anglo-Indians brought money in the shape of capital to\r\nthis country--a statement which requires examination--because they\r\nbrought capital to this country that India must forever be destitute,\r\nmust forever be deprived of any measure of self-government? If this is\r\ntheir claim, it is so preposterously unreasonable that it requires no\r\nrefutation at all. But gentlemen, the claim is curiously worded.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO ANGLO-INDIANS REPRESENT THE BRITISH NATION?\r\n\r\nIt is not a claim put forward on behalf of Anglo-Indians alone but it\r\nis a claim put forward on behalf of the Britishers, it is a claim by\r\nthe people of England. I deny these Anglo-Indian agitators' right to\r\nrepresent the people of England. I deny that they have got any right\r\nto say anything on behalf of the people of England. If any plebiscite\r\nis taken to-day in England, I feel sure that there would be a vast\r\nmajority in favour of the introduction of Self-Government to this\r\ncountry (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMUST WE BE DENIED HOME RULE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BROUGHT CAPITAL?\r\n\r\nIf this claim is based on the mere fact of their introducing capital\r\nin this country, you have to consider whether they have not been\r\nsufficiently profited by the introduction of such capital. Does it mean\r\nthis then that because people bring capital to this country, because\r\nthey find it profitable to do so, they would have the right to say\r\nto the Government: you shall not introduce Self-Government in this\r\ncountry? Have they the right to tell the people: look here, we have\r\nbrought capital to this country, therefore, you shall not have any\r\ndesire to quarrel with these Anglo-Indian agitators. We do not regard\r\npolitics from that utterly selfish point of view from which they regard\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR ONLY CLAIM IS ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nI am free to admit in any scheme of Self-Government which is framed and\r\nwhich is accepted by the people and the Government of this country,\r\nthese Anglo-Indian merchants ought to be allowed to be represented,\r\nthat is to say, I do not desire that any scheme should be framed\r\nwhich would disregard the interests of any class of people, whether\r\nHindu, Mahomedan or Anglo-Indian, whatever the basis of the franchise\r\nmay be. But I say that these people have got no right to dictate to\r\nthe Government of India and to the people alike that they shall not\r\nhave Self-Government. I ask my Anglo-Indian friends to consider this\r\nquestion from a little higher point of view. They must see that India\r\ncannot ever remain without Self-Government. They must see that at some\r\ntime or other the voice of the people is bound to be heard and if they\r\ndo their duty by this country, by which they have been profited to a\r\nvery large extent, they ought to help in this work of Self-Government\r\nrather than oppose it. I call upon them again to stand on a higher\r\nplatform and consider the question of Self-Government not in this way\r\nbut more seriously and with more consideration for the interest of the\r\npeople of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIRRING UP CONFLICTING INTERESTS\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, there is another difficulty to which I must also\r\nrefer. When there are so many conflicting interests in this country it\r\nmay be that particular classes of people will be instigated to stand\r\nup against Home Rule. I blame no one in particular but I am placing\r\nbefore you a possible difficulty. Interested people may stir up the\r\nNamasudras and tell them \"Look here, you are hated and oppressed by\r\nthe people, the Hindus of Bengal, why should you assist them and help\r\nthem to bring in Self-Government because if Self-Government is granted,\r\nthe Hindus are bound to oppress you all the more?\" Advisers may be\r\nfound who will go to my Mahomedan brethren and tell them: \"you are as\r\nyet backward in education, if Self-Government is granted to Hindus why\r\nthey will be more powerful than you and they will look down upon you\r\nand oppress you.\" Endeavours of that description unfortunately are not\r\nuncommon in this country and at such a momentous period of our history\r\nthe same attempts might be repeated. Gentlemen, it is your duty, under\r\nthese circumstances, you who are educated to go to your less educated\r\nbrethren, Hindus or Mahomedans and to expose before them the fallacy of\r\nany such argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE WILL BE NO ROOM FOR OPPRESSION IN OUR SCHEME OF SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nYou ought to tell them that self-government does not mean the\r\nSelf-Government of the Hindus; Self-Government does not mean the\r\nSelf-Government of the Mahomedans; Self-Government does not mean the\r\nSelf-Government of the Zemindars; Self-Government means Government by\r\nall the people of Bengal in which all interests are to be represented\r\nand if there are any classes who are depressed or oppressed, they\r\nought to be told that the sooner self-government is introduced into\r\nthis country the better for them (Hear hear): they ought to be told\r\nthat we have no desire to restrict the franchise in any manner at all\r\nto the disregard of any such interest and if any kind of responsible\r\ngovernment is introduced into this country, which is made responsible\r\nto the people, they will have the power in their hands to oppose any\r\noppression or injustice in every possible way. They will have the power\r\nto return their friends to the Legislative Councils they will have the\r\npower to tell the people who oppose them: if you want to oppress us,\r\nif you go on in that way, it would be against the work of national\r\ndevelopment and you shall not have the power to do that. We are asking\r\nfor putting the power into the hands of the people and are we to be\r\ntold that these people for whom we are fighting in whose interest we\r\nare fighting for the last 30 years, that we are likely to disregard the\r\ninterest of these people?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEEMING MILLIONS ARE OF US\r\n\r\nIf we are not fighting for the teeming millions of India, can anybody\r\ntell me whom we are fighting for? Am I fighting for myself? If I am\r\nselfish, why should I bother about self-government? Why can I not\r\nattend to my profession, make money and go home and sleep? Why should\r\nI go all over the country and demand Home Rule which is the only means\r\nof uplifting the teeming millions of our country if I have not their\r\ninterest at heart? If anybody says that the Nationalists who are\r\nfighting for Home Rule are doing so in their own interest I fling the\r\nlie to the slanderers teeth. I say we are engaged in a noble task and\r\nwe shall not rest content unless such a kind of self-government is\r\ngranted to this country which will keep alive the interest of every\r\ncommunity, which will regard and safeguard the interest of every class\r\nof people in Bengal. We belong to the same race. They are of us. God\r\ngive us strength to fight their battle! (Prolonged Cheers.)\r\n\r\n  (_Amrita Bazar Patrika._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST AGAINST INTERNMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Under the Presidency of Mr. Chakravarty, there was an enthusiastic\r\nmeeting of the citizens of Calcutta, in the Town Hall, on 5th March,\r\n1918 when Mr. C. R. Das spoke as follows:--_\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I feel thankful to you for giving\r\nme this opportunity to raise my voice in protest against this arbitrary\r\nand unjust piece of legislation. Indeed I feel at this moment that no\r\nargument is necessary to convince you of the injustice of this measure.\r\nMr. Chakravarty has dealt with it so fully and elaborately and has\r\nput before you all the considerations with reference to this matter\r\nwith such force and lucidity that it seems unnecessary to continue\r\nthis argument. I will therefore take up the resolution which has been\r\nentrusted to me and place it before you with a few observations which I\r\nhave to make. The resolution consists of 5 clauses. (Mr. Das then read\r\nthe resolution.)\r\n\r\nI will deal with the third clause first, because it admits in my\r\nopinion of no discussion at all. Take all the arguments which had\r\nbeen advanced by His Excellency's government; accept them all. And\r\neven then there can be no justification for the present policy of\r\nthe Government. (Hear, hear.) Either there is evidence against these\r\ninterned persons or there is no evidence. If there is no evidence\r\nagainst them there is an end of the matter at once. And if there is\r\nevidence against them, what justification can there be in not bringing\r\nthem to trial? It only makes people suspicious that there is not\r\nsufficient evidence against them. If there is sufficient evidence what\r\njustification can there be, I repeat, in not placing them instantly\r\nbefore a court of justice for trial? The argument that the present\r\nmachinery of justice is insufficient is an argument which no body\r\nbelieves. I say it will be a dangerous thing if the idea goes abroad\r\nthat people are kept in jail, in police custody without being brought\r\nto trial, while the Government has evidence against them. I say it will\r\nbe a dangerous thing if this idea goes abroad, because people will at\r\nonce come to the conclusion that probably there is no such evidence\r\nwhich can secure conviction in a court of justice. I cannot conceive of\r\na more dangerous consequence.\r\n\r\nLet me now deal with the other clauses of the resolution. I am one of\r\nthose who never believe in tinkering in the matter of legislation.\r\nEither this measure is just or unjust. If it is unjust, there can be\r\nno ground for keeping it on the statute book. The Chairman has put\r\nthis case very clearly before you. He describes this Act as \"lawless\r\nlaw.\" (Hear, hear). I want you to fully realise the meaning of that\r\nobservation made by the distinguished chairman. I say that, behind\r\nthat observation lies the fundamental objection which we have got\r\nagainst the Act. What is \"lawless law\"? Any law which is not based\r\nupon justice, of which the object is not to serve and secure that\r\njustice upon which the stability of society depends, must necessarily\r\nbe \"lawless law.\" It is something which is put forward under cover of\r\nlaw, which is not law, which offends again every principle of justice,\r\nwhich is a negation of justice and therefore negation of law (cheers,).\r\nWe protest against this Act because it offends the fundamental rights\r\nof man. (Hear, hear). To be taken and kept in custody for an indefinite\r\nperiod of time without being told what evidence there is and without\r\nbeing brought to justice according to the law of the land ('shame,\r\nshame') is a denial of the primary rights of humanity. (Hear, hear.)\r\nThis is \"lawless law\" (prolonged cheers.)\r\n\r\nYou must realise what this Act is. I desire to read some portions of it\r\nto you, because many of you are not lawyers and probably do not know\r\nwhat grim injustice lies behind the apparently innocent expressions\r\nwhich you find in this Act. It is called the Defence of India Act--an\r\nAct for the public safety and yet public safety is nowhere defined. It\r\nis a vague generality (Hear, hear.) The public denounce it (hear, hear)\r\npeople do not want it (hear, hear.) Is it to be forced down the throat\r\nof the public--this Act which is based upon grievous and intolerable\r\ninjustice? (Cries of 'no' 'no'--loud cheers).\r\n\r\nLet us follow the text of the law still further. This Act gives power\r\nto certain officials \"civil or military,\"--when in the opinion of such\r\nauthority there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person\r\nhas acted, is acting or is about to act in a manner prejudicial to\r\nthe public safety to direct that such persons shall not enter, reside\r\nor remain in any area specified in writing by such authority or that\r\nsuch person shall reside and remain in any area so specified or that\r\nhe shall conduct himself in such manner or abstain from such act,\r\netc., etc. How beautifully vague! (Hear, hear.) These are admittedly\r\ninnocent words; and when the Act was passed was there any one amongst\r\nus present here to-day who had the slightest idea of the use to which\r\nthis Act might be put? Who at that time ever dreamt that this Act would\r\nbe used for taking away young lads from their homes, keeping them in\r\nprison for days and months, keeping them in solitary cells and for\r\nputting them to indignity after indignity? Was this the intention of\r\nthe legislature when it was passed? One can understand a war measure,\r\none can understand that drastic legislation is necessary at the time of\r\nwar when the enemy is at the gate. But is it just to take away young\r\nlads from their homes, from their mothers' arms, as it were (shame,\r\nshame) and keep them imprisoned ('shame,' 'shame') without telling\r\nthem why, without bringing them to justice ('shame,' 'shame'--loud\r\ncheers)? Is any argument necessary to demonstrate that such an act\r\nis oppressive and must be abrogated? (Hear, hear--loud cheers). The\r\nanswer is necessity, which Lord Morley has characterised as the old\r\nfamiliar plea of tyrants, (shame, shame, hear, hear--loud cheers). Law\r\nis necessary for the preservation of society (Hear, hear,) but not this\r\nthing which you call law (Cheers). Could any law be more arbitrary,\r\nmore unjust than this Act? (Cries of 'no.') I ask you to consider this\r\nplea of necessity again. Surely it is not for defending India against\r\nthe enemy, not for defending Bengal which has suffered most under this\r\noppressive legislation (Cries of 'shame,' 'no,' 'no'). People who\r\nsuffer and groan under this repressive legislation may easily misread\r\nand misunderstand your real object and think that it was intended to\r\ncrush that hunger for liberty, which no bureaucratic government can\r\ntolerate for one single moment (loud cheers).\r\n\r\nThis policy as the Chairman has reminded you began in 1905 with those\r\nillegal circulars which you may remember. Those circulars then, as\r\nyou all know, led to a good deal of misunderstanding. There were\r\ncirculars against the shouting of 'Bandemataram' and various circulars\r\ndirected against students. Some people thought that the object of these\r\ncirculars was also to prevent our self-development and to suppress\r\nour growing hunger for liberty (loud applause). I ask the Government,\r\ncan you blame the people who suffer from such injustice, if they\r\nmisunderstand your object and misconstrue your action? (loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nWe feel it is our bounden duty to raise our voice of protest against\r\nthis Act. The object ascribed is wrong. What is the real object? They\r\nsay \"there is a vast conspiracy in the country.\" My answer is I admit\r\nit I know and believe and I am sure of it as sure as I am standing here\r\nto-night, that there is a revolutionary party in Bengal. But what then?\r\nDo you think that you will be able to suppress that revolutionary party\r\nin that way? Has revolution ever been checked by unjust legislation?\r\nGive me one instance from history where the Government has succeeded\r\nin putting down revolutionary movements by oppressive legislation.\r\nI admit that the thing is an evil. I admit that the activity of\r\nthe revolutionary party is an evil in this country which has to be\r\neradicated. But what is the duty of the Government? Is it not their\r\nduty to take such step as will effectually eradicate it? (Hear, hear.)\r\nDoes the Government really believe that the revolutionary party\r\nwants any other foreign power in this country? (Cries of 'no''no').\r\nI venture to think that they do not. If not, what do they want?\r\nHas the Government ever enquired into the causes which led to that\r\nrevolutionary movement? From 1905 we have been hearing of it, up to now\r\nrepressive measure after repressive measure has been passed (cries of\r\nshame, shame), but has any attempt of any kind whatsoever been made to\r\ndiscover the real causes of this revolutionary movement? (Cries of 'no'\r\n'no'). I may tell you as I have told many of those in authority that I\r\nknow more about these people than probably anybody else in this hall.\r\nI have defended so many of the cases, and I know the psychology of\r\ntheir mind, I know the cause of this revolutionary movement is nothing\r\nbut hunger for freedom. (Hear, hear.) Within the last 150 years what\r\nhave you done to make the people of this country free or even really\r\nfit for freedom? Do we not constantly hear that we are not fit for\r\nself-government ('shame' 'shame') that we are illiterate, that we are\r\nnot sufficiently educated? (shame, shame.) May I retort by asking \"you\r\nhave been here for the last 150 years, with best of motives, with the\r\nobject of making us fit for self-government? Why is it then that you\r\nhave done nothing to this end?\" (loud cheers).\r\n\r\nThis is the psychology of the revolutionary movement. Our educated\r\nyoung men see that nations all over the world are free. They compare\r\ntheir position with the position of other nations, and they say to\r\nthemselves \"why should we remain so? We also want liberty.\" (Cheers).\r\nIs there anything wrong in that desire? Is it so difficult to\r\nunderstand their point of view? Do we not all know this hunger for\r\nliberty? These young men burning with the enthusiasm of youth feel that\r\nthey have not been given any opportunity of taking their legitimate\r\npart in the government of their country, in shaping the course of their\r\nnational development. Give them that right to-day, you will hear no\r\nmore of the revolutionary movement (loud cheers). \"Give them that\r\nright to-day, tell the people of this country here it is, we mean to\r\nchange the system of Government, the government will be yours (loud\r\ncheers) government of the people and by the people, work for the good\r\nof our country, build up your nationality, shape the course of your\r\nhistory\" (loud and prolonged cheers), and I guarantee that from the\r\nnext day the revolutionary party will cease to exist (Hear, hear,\r\nloud and prolonged cheers). I have said this. Our leaders have said\r\nthis over and over again to those in authority, but we have not been\r\nlistened to.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary we are told that the only remedy is the Defence of\r\nIndia Act. ('shame,' 'shame'). We have been told that political crimes\r\nhave decreased, since the passing of this Act. I say it is not so.\r\nOvertacts are not the only measure of political crimes. How could\r\npolitical crimes have decreased when disaffection has increased? (Hear,\r\nhear). Members of the revolutionary party may remain grim and silent,\r\nbut I am sure every case of internment under this Act increases the\r\nvolume of discontent and disaffection in this country. Does not that\r\nstrengthen their hands? This is the real danger (Hear, hear). It is\r\nacting like poison and eating into the vitals of our nationality\r\n(Hear, hear). I protest against this Act as it is a menace to our\r\nliberty (Hear, hear), I protest against this Act as it is a menace to\r\nour loyalty to the empire to which we belong. (Hear, hear, loud and\r\nprolonged cheers).\r\n\r\nThere are people in this country who will tell you that the Government\r\nwill never repeal this Act. So my countrymen I say, \"Do not be\r\ndisheartened.\" (Hear, hear). I believe in my heart of hearts that once\r\nthe people of this country unite and raise their voice, the voice of\r\na united nation, there is no power on the face of the earth which\r\ncan resist it, (loud and prolonged cheers). Let us all say, \"Repeal\r\nthis Act, we will not have it.\" (Hear, hear). Let this cry reach the\r\ncountry, every village, every town; let this meeting be followed up\r\nby hundreds and thousands, let us all be united in our demand for the\r\nrepeal of this Act and I say this Act shall be repealed, (loud and\r\nprolonged cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN DEPUTATION TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n(Under the Presidency of Babu Motilal Ghose, a public meeting of the\r\nCitizens of Calcutta was held on the 18th March, 1918, at Professor\r\nRamamurti's Pavilion, Bow Bazar Street, to support the Indian\r\nDeputation to England, when, Mr. C. R. Das in moving the resolution\r\n\"That this public meeting accords its hearty support to and records\r\nits full approval of the deputation, consisting of among others of\r\nLokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the Hon'ble Mr. G. S. Khaparade, Babu\r\nBebin Chandra Pal, the Hon'ble Mr. B. V. Narasimha Iyer, Mr. Manjeri\r\nRamier, Mr. Syed Hussain, Mr. G. Joseph, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Mr. N.\r\nC Kelkar, Mr. R. P. Karandikar, Babu Jitendralal Banerjee and Pandit\r\nIqbal Narayan Gurtu,\" spoke as follows):--\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--There are two points which are involved in this resolution.\r\nThe first is about the fitness of the gentlemen whom we have selected.\r\nI need hardly say that these gentlemen are in the highest sense the\r\nrepresentatives of this country and I have not the least doubt that if\r\nthe votes of our countrymen were taken--the votes of the uneducated and\r\nthe educated, of all classes and communities in this country,--there\r\ncannot be the least doubt that every one of these gentlemen would have\r\nbeen elected.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question why are we sending these gentlemen to England\r\nat a time when the journey is not safe. The answer to that question\r\nis not very difficult. We are passing through a very critical period\r\nin our history. We feel, every one amongst us who thinks of his\r\ncountry feels, that self-government cannot be delayed any longer.\r\nIf self-government is denied to us it is certain that the growth of\r\nour nationality, and the development of Indian manhood will all be\r\nstopped. It is a matter of absolute necessity that within a short\r\ntime, I say within one year or two, we must have self-government\r\n(cheers)--government responsible to the people--or we cannot exist\r\nas a nation. Now, what are the impediments? We have found out in the\r\ncourse of the last 30 years that the Bureaucracy in this country will\r\nnot grant us anything which is at all substantial. Gentlemen, on one\r\noccasion I had the hardihood to say this before a high official and\r\nI was asked why did I say it. I will tell you what my answer was. I\r\nsaid and I repeat that within the last 30 years there never has been\r\na reform proposed which had not been opposed and defeated by the\r\nBureaucracy (hear, hear). If you consider for one moment the history\r\nof the last 30 years what do you find? You find that the noble policy\r\nof Lord Ripon was opposed by the Bureaucracy, you find that local\r\nself-government for which Lord Ripon fought, although nominally\r\ngranted to us, was in reality denied to us. If you consider again such\r\na simple reform as the separation of the Executive and the Judiciary\r\nwhat do you find? You find that Viceroy after Viceroy recommended it.\r\nYou find statesman after statesman in England recommended it; yet,\r\nwhat is it which has prevented such a useful reform being put through?\r\nMy answer is, it is the Bureaucracy in this country. (Shame, shame).\r\nThink again of Lord Morley's reforms which is called the Minto-Morley\r\nreforms. I said to this high official that this scheme was something\r\nwhen it left the shores of England, but it became absolutely ridiculous\r\nwhen it got into the hands of the Indian Bureaucracy (Shame, shame.). I\r\nwas then asked why did I say so? My answer was and my answer is because\r\nI have not got a vote under that scheme and I pointed out that Sir S.\r\nP. Sinha, who was considered worthy enough to be appointed a member of\r\nthe Executive Council was not a qualified voter either (shame, shame.)\r\nUnder these circumstances are we not justified in saying that that\r\nscheme was rendered absolutely ridiculous when it got into the hands of\r\nthe Indian Bureaucracy? (cheers.)\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that you may agitate as long as you like; you\r\nmay demand your right as you have a right to demand, but you will\r\nnot get the Bureaucracy in this country to support you. You must,\r\ntherefore, go to their masters. Our demands must be carried across the\r\nseas to the great British Democracy (cheers). We want to be told why\r\nis it that we are not fit for self-government? I have said on other\r\noccasions that I do not ask for any particular kind of right which\r\nrequires any elaborate consideration. I want the right which every\r\nnation on the face of the earth has--the right to build up our own\r\nconstitution (cheers). I do not care about the details of the scheme\r\njust now. You can discuss them fully when the time comes. The question\r\nat present is a very simple one. I want our representatives to go to\r\nEngland, and tell the British Democracy that, we want nothing more,\r\nnothing less, than, the right to build up our own constitution,--a\r\nconstitution which alone will enable us to secure the development of\r\nour nationality, a constitution which is absolutely necessary for the\r\ndevelopment of our manhood. Our representatives must go to England and\r\ntell the British people that the men on the spot are no longer to be\r\ntrusted (hear, hear)--they must plead our case and they must insist on\r\nour rights (cheers).\r\n\r\nIf we find that we are not to get self-government, we have at least\r\nthe right to get an honest answer. Let the British Democracy say if it\r\nlikes, that this war is a war of liberation of humanity, but liberation\r\nof humanity does not include the liberation of India. If that is the\r\nview of the British Democracy let them tell us so. We won't be content\r\nwith excuses and pretences. Gentlemen, when I consider the objections\r\nput forward to the grant of self-government, I can hardly keep my\r\npatience. What is it that they say? They say we are not educated\r\nenough to get self-government. My answer is: whose fault is it? For the\r\nlast 150 years you have been governing this country, and yet you have\r\nnot succeeded in educating the people of this country to such an extent\r\nthat they may be fit for governing themselves. Do we not know that\r\nJapan was made only in 50 years? You have had 150 years. Why is it that\r\nat the end of that period we are told that we are not fit to govern\r\nourselves? The very statement fills us with apprehension. As days go\r\nby, we will be rendered more and more unfit. No gentlemen, nobody\r\nreally believes that the time has not come. It is a matter of immediate\r\nnecessity and we must have it (cheers).\r\n\r\nThen we are told, we are divided between many sects. We follow\r\ndifferent religions, we have got different interests to serve and so\r\non. Arguments are piled upon arguments in this way--it is always easy\r\nto argue and we at any rate who belong to the profession of law, know\r\nthat it is always possible to argue. (Laughter). We all know that\r\nthough vanquished, one can argue still (laughter). But do we not know,\r\nfrom the history of civilization, that directly you make people of\r\ndifferent classes, of different religions, and of different interests,\r\nwork together, work for a common good, do we not find that unity is\r\nbrought about more successfully from the very fact of having to work\r\ntogether than by any other means? Therefore if you say that we are not\r\nfit for Self-Government, because we are divided in our interests, and\r\nin our religions, my answer is that self-government and self-government\r\nalone is the remedy of that. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nThen we are told that there is a revolutionary party amongst us and\r\ntherefore we cannot be trusted with self-government. I have said\r\nelsewhere and I say again that I am not one of those who deny that\r\nthere is a revolutionary party. But if you consider that question\r\nfor the moment, you find that the only remedy which is possible,\r\nthe only remedy which will effectually eradicate the revolutionary\r\nmovement, is, the grant of self-government (loud cheers). I say this\r\nto the Government--you have been troubled over this revolutionary\r\nmovement for so many years now--you suspected it in 1905. Have you\r\never made any effort to understand the psychology of that movement?\r\nHave you ever appointed any commission to enquire into the causes of\r\nthis revolutionary movement? No. And yet, we have to take it that you\r\nwant to eradicate it by repressive legislation (shame). My answer is\r\nthat repressive legislation can never put an end to a revolutionary\r\nmovement--it is only by satisfying their legitimate desire, it is only\r\nby satisfying their hunger, as I said the other day, for liberty that\r\nyou can put an end to it. If you understand that problem you will find\r\nthat the sooner self-government is introduced into this country it\r\nis better. I say it is better not only from the point of view of us\r\nIndians, it is better from the point of view of the British Democracy\r\nalso, and that is what I desire that our representatives should tell\r\nthem. It is the interest of India, it is the interest of England--it is\r\nreally the true interest of both countries which will be served by the\r\ngrant of self-government (loud applause).\r\n\r\nIf under ordinary circumstances, this deputation is necessary, I say\r\nit is rendered more necessary now, that the Anglo-Indian agitation has\r\nsucceeded in starting a new association in England under the name of\r\nthe Indo-British association. Gentlemen, I must at once tell you that\r\nthe name is a misnomer. There is nothing 'Indo' in that association,\r\nexcept this, that there are members belonging to that association who\r\nhave been benefited largely by India (hear, hear), that is the only\r\nIndo about this association. There are no Indians but there are members\r\nwho have lived here amongst us--I do not desire to use any harsh\r\nlanguage--who have been profited greatly (laughter). We are told, we\r\nshould be everlastingly grateful to these people for coming over here\r\nall the way and putting lots of money into their pockets and leaving us\r\nto our fate. Well, gentlemen, these are men who represent the 'Indo'\r\npart of that association (laughter).\r\n\r\nI tell you gentlemen, there is nothing British about them either\r\n(laughter). I cannot understand any association which has anything\r\nBritish in it which stands up against the legitimate aspirations\r\nof the people of a country (hear, hear). I refuse to believe that\r\nEngland has sunk so low to-day that her sons will form themselves\r\ninto an association for the express purpose of crushing the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the people of India (hear, hear). Therefore,\r\ngentlemen, there is nothing \"Indo\" and nothing really \"British\" in\r\nthis association which was started expressly, as I say, to oppose all\r\nreforms, to put down a whole people, so that their aspirations--their\r\njust aspirations, may be crushed for ever. So, gentlemen, if this\r\ndeputation was necessary under normal circumstances, it has become\r\nabsolutely necessary for our representatives to go to England to\r\nexpose the vagaries of this association. If they have fed the British\r\npublic with falsehood after falsehood, surely it is necessary for\r\nour representatives to meet them and expose the falsity of their\r\nutterances. Our representatives will be able to convince the British\r\npublic that the grant of Home Rule is no longer a matter of gift (hear,\r\nhear). It is no longer a matter of beneficence but it is a matter of\r\nnecessity which must be accomplished immediately (cheers).\r\n\r\nThey talk of progressive stages now. I say if you had started teaching\r\nthe people the art of governing themselves 30 years ago, if you granted\r\nhalf a boon or even quarter of a boon at that time and went on granting\r\nmore and more why, by to-day we would have had complete self-government\r\nin this country (hear, hear.) You have not done that. We have waited\r\nand waited and our patience is exhausted (hear, hear). Our faith in the\r\nman on the spot is gone (hear, hear) and nothing that you can do now,\r\nno honied words of beneficence, no eloquent speech of England's duty,\r\nno promise, no assurance will ever give us back that faith which you\r\nhave crushed; (cheers)--that hope which you have killed (loud cheers).\r\n\r\nWhat is our duty? Our duty is clear. We must depend on ourselves\r\n(hear, hear.) We must tell our own people to get ready for this great\r\nconstitutional fight. It has been going on for the last 30 years but\r\nthe time has come when its vigour must be doubled. We must put more\r\nenergy into it, we must go on, fighting here in this country till\r\nwe get what we demand. And in the meantime our representatives must\r\ngo to England and acquaint the people there with the true state of\r\naffairs.--We want no favour. We have ceased to rely on beneficence or\r\ngenerosity. What we want is our legitimate rights. And who in this\r\nworld has got the power of denying that which is ours, to claim, and to\r\ndeprive us of that which is undoubtedly our right? (Loud cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMIERS APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Under the Presidency of Mr. Chakravarty a largely attended meeting of\r\nthe citizens of Calcutta was held in April 1918, when Mr. C. R. Das\r\nspoke:--_\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen,--the resolution which has been entrusted\r\nto me is in these words (Mr. Das read the resolution). It is hardly\r\nnecessary to commend this resolution to your acceptance by any lengthy\r\nspeech. The resolution speaks for itself. It is only because I have\r\nheard of objections in some quarters that I have to say a few words in\r\nsupport of the resolution. There are people amongst us who think that\r\nit is not gracious at this time, in the face of the great danger which\r\nbesets us, to trouble the Government by asking for political rights\r\nand privileges. Gentlemen, it is for the very success of the measure\r\nthat I am asking the Government to consider the resolution. My answer\r\nto those critics is this: Do you think that a country where the people\r\nhave been fighting for political rights for so many years and where\r\nevery time their petitions and prayers have been rejected with scorn,\r\ndo you think that in such a country you will get a very large army in\r\nBengal to come forward unless you can create among them an enthusiasm,\r\nunless you can make them feel that they are fighting their own battle\r\n(hear, hear). Is it reasonable to ask the people of this country to\r\njoin the army when you have made it impossible for them to feel that\r\nthis is their country, when you have made it impossible for them to\r\nfeel that empire you speak of is their empire? Have they any share\r\nin that empire? Is it possible for the people of this country under\r\nthese circumstances to respond to the call which you have made to-day?\r\nAfter all, what are we asking for--is it an unreasonable request to\r\nmake to the Government--here are these young men, members of many\r\nfamilies of Bengal, whom you have interned, kept under imprisonment\r\nand in custody--is it so much unreasonable to ask Government now, in\r\nthe face of a great danger, which threatens you and which threatens\r\nus, also, to release them and make them feel that after all it is\r\ntheir country, that there is a Government which feel for them (hear,\r\nhear)--that they have a Government also which care for their rights\r\nand privileges--is it an unreasonable request at this juncture to ask\r\nthe Government to consider this resolution? Call to arms has been\r\nsounded--it is our duty--it is the duty of every one of us to respond\r\nto that call; and I do say this, because I feel it my duty to tell\r\nthe Government, at this juncture that in order that that response may\r\nbe real--in order that that response may be fruitful that you ought\r\nto consider the position of these prisoners who are detained in jail\r\nand kept in custody without trial. I am not raising the question as to\r\nwhether they are innocent or guilty,--let that question wait till the\r\ndanger is over, I am asking the Government to release them, so that\r\nthey may respond to this call to arms. With these people interned, do\r\nyou think you can get thousands and tens of thousands in the army in\r\nthis country? Release them. What army do you want, which Bengal cannot\r\nfurnish? I take upon myself to give up my profession for six months\r\n(loud cheers) and go over the whole of this country asking the people\r\nto join the army in their thousands (cheers). I ask the Government to\r\nmake it possible for us to raise this army. Gentlemen, when I think of\r\nour present position, while the danger is before us, and the attitude\r\nand the relation, if I may call it, between the Government, I mean\r\nthe Bureaucracy, on the one hand, and the people on the other, I must\r\nconfess, I look upon this as a tragedy. The Bureaucracy suspects the\r\npeople.--Often and often have we told them, we have cried ourselves\r\nhoarse--and I repeat this again--I know these people--I have defended\r\ntheir cases--there is not one among the revolutionaries who wants to\r\nbring a foreign power in this country--be that foreign power Germany\r\nor Japan. I am prepared to prove it, if there is an enquiry--a proper\r\nenquiry by impartial men. But all those requests have fallen on deaf\r\nears. Why? Because the Government distrusts the people. The result is\r\nthey misunderstand us and misinterpret our statements and utterances.\r\nIn the same way, we, the people mistrust them because they mistrust us.\r\n(hear, hear). I am free to confess that we very often misunderstand\r\ntheir declarations and mistrust them unjustly but the fact that we\r\nmisunderstand each other is there, and I say it is a tragedy. I can\r\nassure the Government that I can prove it to demonstration, to whatever\r\npolitical party an individual in this country may belong, there is not\r\none man in Bengal, who really desires that the English people should\r\nlose all connection with India and that some other foreign power should\r\nbe brought here (loud cheers and hear, hear.) You do not believe that.\r\nWe want to justify ourselves and want to become ourselves. We want\r\nto feel that this country really belongs to us--we want to feel that\r\nwe are a nation--that we have got our specialities. We want to give\r\nexpression to our ideals and we want to stand side by side with the\r\ndifferent nations of the world and we do believe that with the English\r\nconnection, it would be easier for us to do so than if we tried to\r\nmake the English connection cease. That is the real attitude of the\r\npeople. But the pity is, they will not believe us, with the result\r\nthat whatever they say on many occasions, we do not believe. That is\r\nwhy I think it is a tragedy. I appeal to the Government again to come\r\nforward. The Prime Minister has sounded the call to arms. It is not\r\nonly a call to arms but it is a call to duty (hear, hear). We are\r\nhere prepared to discharge our duty. Do you do your duty, in the same\r\nspirit--come forward and forget your racial prejudices, forget your\r\nsense of prestige.--Stand side by side with us.--Hold us by your hands\r\nand you will find between the two of us we will raise such an army\r\nin Bengal which will beat back all foreign aggression (loud cheers.)\r\nIf the thing were possible, I say to the Government again, if you\r\nreally think you can raise a large army in this country, if you can\r\nshow us that it is probable, though I am a Nationalist, I say, that\r\nI am prepared to postpone our struggle for political privileges till\r\nthe war is over. If it were possible, do it by any means. Call for\r\nany sacrifice and the people of Bengal will not be slow to respond to\r\nthat. If in the face of this great danger, I ask you to release the\r\npolitical prisoners, it is because I feel that if you do that, that\r\nwhich you want will be secured. If you think you can secure what you\r\nwant without releasing the political prisoners, do so. You will not\r\nfind me slow to do my part of the duty (cheers.) I am prepared to wait\r\nif I see that the Government with our help can raise a large army in\r\nBengal to-day to face a great danger--if I see that and if I find that\r\nsuch a course is likely to succeed, I am prepared to wait till the war\r\nis over for the fulfilment of those broken pledges. I will be prepared\r\nto wait and dream of to-morrow, of the future, when our ambitions will\r\nbe satisfied--and satisfied they must be--I will forget the history of\r\nbroken pledges, of dead hopes and crushed aspirations. I will wait in\r\nsilence and in patience. Do make it possible. Call for any sacrifice\r\nand here we are at your service. We will wait till the war is over.--We\r\nwill look forward to a later date for the fulfilment of broken pledges\r\nand the resurrection of our dead hopes and our crushed aspirations,\r\n(loud cheers.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. C. R. Das spoke--On the third day's session of the Congress held\r\nin Calcutta in 1917._\r\n\r\nMadam President, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have the honour to support\r\nthe resolution which has been placed before you. Brother delegates, at\r\nthe very outset I desire to refer to the song to which you have just\r\nlistened; it is a song of the glory and victory of India. We stand here\r\nto-day on this platform for the glory and victory of India, (Cheers)\r\nand I urge you that amidst the many discussions which have taken place\r\non the form of the resolution, you should not forget the essential idea\r\nwhich runs through it and which stands behind it. It is a resolution\r\nwhich has for its object the growth and the development of the great\r\nIndian nation. We are all agreed about that. The question is how to\r\nbring that about. Gentlemen, the Bengal ideal has been presented to\r\nyou to-day by my friend, Babu Bipin Chandra Pal. I accept that ideal\r\nand if I thought that there was anything in this resolution which was\r\ninconsistent with that ideal, I should not have supported it. I do\r\nnot think there is anything in this resolution which goes against\r\nthe ideal which Bengal has unanimously declared by its resolution at\r\nthe Bengal Provincial Conference. What is that ideal? That ideal is\r\nfirstly, Provincial Autonomy _viz._, that the Government of India must\r\nhave its sphere demarcated, its functions defined; all other functions\r\nshould belong to the Provincial governments of the particular province.\r\nGentlemen, is that an ideal which is foreign to that resolution? I ask\r\nyou to look into it carefully. I find within it a careful demarcation\r\nof the sphere of the Government of India and those of the Provincial\r\ngovernments. Therefore, so far as that ideal is concerned I do not\r\nthink that this is at all inconsistent with the resolution which I\r\nhave the honour to support. Now gentlemen, what is the next point in\r\nthe ideal of Bengal? And that is: that the functions of the Executive\r\nGovernment must be made subordinate to the Legislative Council which\r\nwould represent the wishes of the people of the particular province.\r\nNow is there anything in this resolution which goes against that? It\r\nmay be that Bengal has provided for that in one particular way and\r\nin this resolution you have provided for that in another way, but\r\nso far as the ideal is concerned, I say that there is absolutely no\r\ndifference between that of Bengal and that which is shadowed in this\r\nresolution (Hear, hear.) You say in this resolution that the power of\r\nthe purse should be in the hands of the Legislature. Now, gentlemen,\r\njust pause for one moment to think what that means. Let us take it\r\nthat your scheme is accepted by the Government. What does that mean?\r\nThat means that the Executive must be obedient to the Legislature. If\r\nthey do not obey the commands of the Legislature, the Legislature will\r\nsay we stop the supplies. It may be said that the British Parliament\r\nwill never grant you that; but are we considering that at present?\r\nWhen they make a definite pronouncement as to what they are willing to\r\ngive us, it will be time then to meet again and formulate a definite\r\nscheme as to the way in which that ideal may be given effect to. But\r\nthe time has not come to discuss about it, because I am afraid in the\r\ndiscussion of it, the main ideal may get lost and I am most anxious to\r\nkeep up that ideal before you. But whatever happens to the drafting\r\nof this resolution, the matter of drafting may be corrected,--I hope,\r\ngentlemen, that whatever happens, you will stick to this; that the time\r\nhas come when the British Parliament must make up its mind to transfer\r\nthe powers from the hands of the Bureaucracy to the people of this\r\ncountry. (Loud Cheers). We have had enough of the Bureaucracy in this\r\ncountry. We have suffered and groaned under the misrule of 150 years\r\nand not one day is to be lost in declaring our will and to see that our\r\nwishes are given effect to--that the powers which are in the hands of\r\nthe Bureaucracy to-day are transferred to the people of the country.\r\n(Cheers). Now, gentlemen, having regard to that ideal, I must say that\r\nI do not see any inconsistency between what we want in Bengal and that\r\nwhich is put forward in the resolution. But my revered friend, Mr.\r\nTilak said that this scheme is very much better than the Bengal scheme\r\nor any other scheme. I am speaking of Provincial Governments--of the\r\nscheme which relates to the ideal of the Provincial Governments and I\r\ndo not see any difference there. Mr. Tilak thinks it is not wise to\r\nask too much. I ask him to read the resolution again and he will find\r\nin it that it does not claim one item less than the Bengal scheme--not\r\none item less. It claims the whole thing--it claims perfect responsible\r\ngovernment for India. I do not understand the power over the purse\r\nto mean anything less than that. Without saying perfect responsible\r\ngovernment for the provinces as well as for the central government,\r\nyou may convey the same idea by saying: \"I do not care what you do but\r\ngive me the power over the purse. But if you give me the power over the\r\npurse I can have my own way. You, the executive, you say you will not\r\nobey my command but I will stop your supplies. Where are you then? You\r\nwill have to obey my command.\" And if they obey your command what is\r\nthe good of saying that we have not asked for Responsible Government?\r\nYou have asked in an indirect manner, but as effectively as we have\r\ndone in Bengal. You have asked not only for full responsible government\r\nfor the provinces but also for the central government. Now it may be,\r\nthat this ought to be put in another shape, the words may have to be\r\nchanged, for this scheme does not pretend to be a perfect or an exact\r\none.\r\n\r\nI agree with my friend Mr. Jinnah who said: let the Government come out\r\nwith a definite pronouncement--the government declaration is vague--let\r\nthe government come out with its declaration--a definite pronouncement\r\nas to what they are willing to give. It will be time then to sit over\r\nthis resolution again, to consider what words are to be used and what\r\nwords to reject or what new words are to be put in. I think we have\r\nbeen fighting unnecessarily. We are all agreed as to the great ideal.\r\nLet us gather strength to fight for it--let us fight for it with all\r\nour might and let us not rest content till the whole thing is granted\r\nto us (Hear, hear), viz., Responsible Government in the Provinces,\r\nresponsible Government in Imperial matters--till the whole of the\r\nGovernment is put into the hands of the people. I rely on no dictum of\r\npoliticians--I rely upon my natural right (Cheers). I do not care what\r\nthe constitution of England or the constitution of Switzerland or that\r\nof Australia is (Cheers). I want to build my own constitution. I want\r\nthe power to build my own constitution in a way which is suited to this\r\ncountry and which afterwards will be referred to as the great Indian\r\nconstitution (Loud cheers). That is what we want and that is what we\r\nmust have. Do not engage in endless discussion in the meantime. Gather\r\nall your strength and say with one voice all over India, in every\r\nvillage, in every town, in provincial gatherings and in this Congress\r\nthat nothing less than the transference of the Governmental powers into\r\nthe hands of the people will satisfy us. It is our natural right, it is\r\nthe birthright of every individual to live and to grow (Hear, hear). It\r\nis the natural right of every nation to live and to grow according to\r\nits nature. (Loud cheers). We demand that right--that right has been\r\nunjustly withheld from us--by excuses and pretences--by subterfuges--we\r\nhave discovered that. We were sleeping, but by God's grace, we are\r\nawake and we claim our natural right. (Prolonged cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A meeting held at Chittagong under the auspices of the local Home Rule\r\nLeague on the 12th June 1918, under the presidency of Babu Jatra Mohan\r\nSen, when Mr. C. R. Das delivered the following speech:--_\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen,--I thank you heartily for the many kind\r\nwords with which your distinguished Chairman has introduced me to you\r\nthis evening and for the kindness with which you have received me. When\r\nI set out for Chittagong I made up my mind to place before the people\r\nof Chittagong my views and the views of our friends in Calcutta on many\r\nof the important topics of the day. I am afraid I shall not be able\r\nto do so as fully as I had intended after a long day's work in Court.\r\nBut I shall try to place before you in short the thoughts which are\r\nagitating the minds of our friends in Calcutta. I mean those who have\r\nworked with us the whole of last year and for many years before that in\r\nsupport of the cause of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE HOUR\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I need hardly tell you that the most important question of\r\nthe hour is the question of self-government. Upon the solution of this\r\nquestion depends the solution of many other questions, upon which again\r\ndepend the full development of our nationality and if for the whole of\r\nlast year we have been putting forth our best energies and our earnest\r\nefforts in the cause of Home Rule or self-government it is because we\r\nfeel--I feel and many of my friends feel--that unless and until we have\r\nthe government of this country in our own hands it is impossible to\r\ncarry on the work of nation building. (Hear, Hear). Gentlemen, we could\r\nafford to be idle in the past when we hoped that the Government would\r\ndo everything for us. But now after 150 years of British rule, where do\r\nwe find ourselves? If you consider our position, the actual realities\r\nof our position to-day after 150 years of British rule, you will at\r\nonce see that we are in a hopeless condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DO WE STAND?\r\n\r\nWhat have we got which we can call our own? If the enemy knocks at\r\nour door have we got strength to fight him? Have we got the weapons\r\nof warfare? Have we got even a lathi with which we can defend our\r\nhearths and homes?--No. (Cheers) Have we got money?--No. (Cheers) Are\r\nthe people, the vast majority of the people of Bengal educated?--No.\r\nOne hundred and fifty years of British rule have passed by without\r\nconferring real education on the people of this country. You need not\r\nenquire into the causes. I am only trying to give you a picture of\r\nthe helplessness of our position to-day. We have not got anything--we\r\nhave not got money, we have not got arms, we have not got education.\r\nWell, an analysis of our position to-day will tell you more eloquently\r\nthan any speaker can that the only solution of this question is\r\nself-government. The very objections which are urged against the\r\ngranting of self-government are to my mind good reasons for granting\r\nhome rule to this country (Cheers). It is said that we do not deserve\r\nSelf-Government because the people of this country are not educated. My\r\nanswer to that is why have they remained uneducated so long? In other\r\ncountries education has been introduced and carried far within a period\r\nof 20 years or 25 years--in some countries in less than that. But why\r\nis it or how is it that within the last 150 years of British rule--the\r\nbureaucratic government in the country has not succeeded in educating\r\nthe people of this country? Why is it so? It is not necessary for them.\r\nIt is not necessary for the bureaucracy to do that, but it is necessary\r\nfor the people of this country. It is necessary for the development of\r\nour race. It is necessary for the very existence of our nationality.\r\nNow, if you say that we are not fit for self-government because we are\r\nuneducated, I say that is the very reason why you ought to give us\r\nHome Rule, because if you do so we will succeed in educating the vast\r\nmajority of our countrymen in 20 year's time (Cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\nDO WE WANT AN OLIGARCHY?\r\n\r\nNow, they say, well, it is only a few of you educated people who will\r\nexercise the franchise, How can you represent the country? You will be\r\nonly an oligarchy. The Government, instead of being in the hands of the\r\nbureaucracy, will be transferred into the hands of an oligarchy--of\r\nanother bureaucracy. My answer to that is that we do not want that.\r\nI ask you particularly to consider that question, gentlemen, and to\r\nrealise its importance. My answer to them is that we do not want it.\r\nWe want the franchise to be extended far and wide--we want our ryots\r\nand our cultivators to enjoy that franchise. We want them to exercise\r\ntheir franchise. It is against our self-interest but we want that it\r\nshould be done because after all the difference between those who are\r\nagainst the granting of Home Rule to this country and ourselves is\r\nthis: bureaucracy is against it because the granting of Home Rule means\r\ndeath to the bureaucracy. The Europeans, the Anglo-Indian merchants in\r\nCalcutta are against it because it is against their interest, because\r\nthey thrive well under the protecting shelter of this bureaucracy.\r\nOur personal interest also lies in not getting the franchise extended\r\nall over the country--but rather in keeping it confined within the\r\neducated community, an insignificant portion of the Mahomedan community\r\nand an equally insignificant portion of the Hindu community, a few\r\nBrahmins, Baidyas and Kayesthas. If you grant franchise to all the\r\npeople of this country where shall we be? In saying this I remember a\r\nconversation I had with an old friend of mine who shall be nameless.\r\nThis gentleman said to me, well, if you get Home Rule, what does it\r\nmean? It means that the common people of this country will have a\r\nvoice--it means they will have power and we, Brahmins, Baidyas and\r\nKayesthas, where shall we go? I said to him in answer that they will go\r\nto a very hot place where they deserve to go. Gentlemen, I want you to\r\nrealise this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we are not fighting for our narrow sordid self-interest--we\r\nare not fighting for the interest of to-day--we are not fighting for\r\nthe betterment of myself or yourselves--of the present generation or\r\nof the educated community. If there are any selfish ideals pursued by\r\nany portion of our community, I stand dissociated from them and I say I\r\ntake my stand on this and nothing more--it does not matter what happens\r\nto me--it does not matter what happens to the present generation--it\r\ndoes not matter what happens to the educated community of to-day, but\r\nwhat matters with me is the development of the nation (Cheers.) I look\r\nforward to the time when the Bengalee nation will rise and stand in\r\nall its glory. I do not care whether I am alive or dead at that moment\r\n(Loud Cheers)--whether my children will be living then or not--but\r\nthe time will come when by God's grace, Bengalees as a nation will\r\nmake themselves felt and will stand in all their strength and face the\r\nworld. That is the ideal which appeals to me every moment of my life. I\r\nfeel within myself that that is my appointed task. I shall devote all\r\nthat I hold dear to the service of that cause and--if I die in that\r\nattempt--what then? \"Fail we alone\"?--if I die in this work, I believe\r\nI shall be born in this country again and again, live for it, hope for\r\nit, work for it with all the energy of my life and with all the love of\r\nmy nature, till I see the fulfilment of my hope and the realisation of\r\nthis ideal (Loud Cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALL WE FOLLOW A LEADER OF YESTERDAY EVEN WHEN HE IS WRONG\r\n\r\nGentlemen, when we started this agitation--basing it on the ideal to\r\nwhich I have just referred--ever since then we have been living under a\r\ncross fire. The bureaucracy has been against us, as it is natural they\r\nwould be against us, as it is natural they should be against us. But I\r\nam sorry to say that along with these there is a party of Bengalees in\r\nCalcutta who also have set themselves against the fulfilment of this\r\nnoble ideal. When I read the criticisms which appear in the _Statesman_\r\nor the _Englishman_ I feel glad because I know that we have succeeded\r\nin exposing the illogical position which they take. But when I read\r\nsimilar things in the _Bengalee_, I assure you, I feel a great pain\r\nin my heart. I cannot understand it. Is this ideal to be pursued from\r\nthe consideration of purely personal question? We have been told that\r\nthe leaders of yesterday are the only people who can lead us. I do not\r\ndeny their claim to lead. But I am not one of those who would follow a\r\nleader simply because he was a leader yesterday. I want him to lead.\r\nAnybody who leads the real politics of the country at the present time\r\nis a man whom I honour and I am prepared to bow down and take the dust\r\nof his feet. But if a man comes to me and says: look here you will\r\nhave to do this--it does not matter what the people of Bengal want--I\r\nam the leader of Bengal--this has been done by me--it has got to be\r\nsupported--well, my answer to him is: \"thou imposter!\" No one has got\r\nthat right. We stand or fall as we pursue or desist from the popular\r\ncause. I am nothing. No leader is anything. The strength belongs to the\r\nnation whose representative I am, whose representative every one of us\r\nmay become. It is not my own strength. It is the peoples' strength.\r\nTake your stand on that and we will worship you as a leader, as a\r\nmartyr, as anything which you can claim but fall short of that ideal\r\nonce by a hair's breadth, your claim is no longer to be recognised. If\r\nI have expressed myself strongly, believe me, gentlemen, it is because\r\nI have felt deeply--I feel, I have been stabbed to the heart by this\r\nattitude--this contempt of public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS THERE AN UNDERTAKING?\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, you all know that we are expecting a scheme of\r\nself-government from the British Parliament. What that scheme is I do\r\nnot know. No one has got the right to know but we are expecting some\r\nscheme. We heard that Mr. Montagu had shown or talked about the outline\r\nof that scheme to some Indian leaders--Mr. Surendranath Banerjea of\r\nBengal, Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya of the U. P. and Mr. Shastri of\r\nMadras and certain other gentlemen. I do not know if it is true but I\r\nsuspect it is. We are also told--it is not admitted--we are told that\r\nsome of these gentlemen had given a promise to the Secretary of State\r\nthat they would get the people of this country to accept that scheme. I\r\nam not saying that this is admitted but that is what I have heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFIDENTIAL LETTER.\r\n\r\nNow what do we find after that? A few days after Mr. Montagu's\r\ndeparture, a confidential letter over the signature of Babu Satyananda\r\nBose was circulated and anybody who reads that letter will see that\r\nthe attempt is to give up what was decided in the Bengal Provincial\r\nConference for all Bengal,--to give it up, and to take whatever is\r\noffered to us by the Secretary of State! Why was that circular issued?\r\nWas it only Mr. Satyananda Bose who circulated this or was there a\r\nparty behind it? We know Mr. Satyananda Bose is a follower of Mr.\r\nSurendranath Banerjea. Was it the attempt of only Mr. Satyananda\r\nBose or was it a subtle attempt made in the dark to throw out to the\r\npeople the suggestion that they ought to be satisfied with anything\r\nwhich it may please Mr. Montagu to give, to prepare the ground for the\r\nacceptance of Mr. Montagu's scheme? After that we heard that a special\r\nsession of the Congress would be held in Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESS COMMITTEE'S CIRCULAR\r\n\r\nIt is after that that the secretaries of the Provincial Congress\r\nCommittee wrote this letter:\r\n\r\n \"Dear Sir,--It appears that the Secretary of State for India will\r\n very soon make his announcement about the proposed Reforms. It is\r\n in contemplation to hold a special session of the Congress and of\r\n the Provincial Conference after the announcement. We have a duty\r\n to perform. The future of our country for at least a generation\r\n will depend upon the nature of the Reforms. You will therefore keep\r\n yourselves ready to hold public meetings, to attend the Congress\r\n (wherever held) and the Conference in very large numbers and to\r\n fearlessly criticise the proposals if they fall short of our ideal.\r\n We must make a united stand and see that they meet our legitimate\r\n aspirators.\r\n\r\n Yours faithfully,--_I. B. Sen, Bejoy Krishna Bose, Secys.\"_\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, you have heard the whole of this letter. Do you think\r\nthere is anything objectionable in this letter? What does the letter\r\nsay? It says merely that Mr. Montagu is going to make his pronouncement\r\nand that we have to watch, if it falls short of our ideal and our\r\nlegitimate aspirations and if so we ought to fight against it, we\r\nought to attend in large numbers, the special session of the Congress\r\nand conference to show a united front, and to criticise the scheme\r\nfearlessly. Now, is there anything in this to which any Nationalist,\r\nany person who has the good of his country at heart can take the\r\nslightest objection?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 'BENGALEE'S PATHOS\r\n\r\nI will read out to you what the _Bengalee_ says. Unfortunately we\r\ncannot dissociate the Editor of the _Bengalee_ from the paper.\r\nOtherwise I would have cast it into the waste-paper basket and would\r\nnot have thought about it. This is what the _Bengalee_ writes in its\r\neditorial of June 6th;--\r\n\r\n \"We confess that we have read the above with pain and regret, though\r\n not with surprise, for in a recent article, we pretty clearly\r\n indicated the constitution and the policy of the present Bengal\r\n Provincial Congress Committee. The old leaders are the men of\r\n yesterday and they of course should have no voice in the deliberation\r\n of the _New India_ which they have helped to build up. For we are\r\n always wiser than our fathers, and to acknowledge our indebtedness\r\n to them is to belittle our own importance which must always be a\r\n prime consideration. There is only one little risk which their policy\r\n involves and they may as well be reminded of it thus early, _viz_.,\r\n that they may be paid back in their own coins and with compound\r\n interest by those who come after them.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is there in this innocent letter to call for this personal and\r\nvehement attack? Are we to be condemned because we are asking the\r\npeople of this country to watch the pronouncement of the Secretary of\r\nState? We are asking the people of this country to examine it and if it\r\nfalls short of popular demands to criticise it, fearlessly and to hold\r\nmeetings and to attend those meetings in large numbers. \"Large numbers\"\r\nis italicised by the _Bengalee_. It is a crime, a new crime to hold\r\nmeetings where \"large numbers\" attend. It used not to be so in the past\r\nbut it has become a crime now! I will go on reading another passage\r\nfrom this article:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REALLY GREAT DANGER\r\n\r\n \"Let us now pass on to the consideration of the circular. The tone\r\n is pessimistic. It is even worse: it is that of the alarmist who\r\n raises the signal note of warning, as if we were on the eve of a great\r\n danger.\"\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, if I am to tell you the truth, I admit that I suspect\r\nwe are on the eve of a great danger and that grave danger is the\r\nacceptance of a system of self-government which will not give us the\r\nreality, which will give us self-government in name but not in fact. It\r\nis the duty of every Nationalist to raise that alarm. It does no harm\r\nto watch, even suspiciously watch what it is and if it does not satisfy\r\nthe people of this country, to reject it, to say that we do not want\r\nit,--Take it back.\r\n\r\n \"Our countrymen are asked to be ready to fearlessly criticise the\r\n proposals, if they fall short of our ideal.\"\r\n\r\nVery wrong indeed! Now mark what follows:--\r\n\r\n \"Brave words indeed coming with special aptness from some of those who\r\n ran away as fast as their legs could carry them when the Police broke\r\n up the Barisal Conference.\"\r\n\r\nThat is worthy of the leader of the Bengalee nation! To circulate--this\r\nfalsehood! It may be within the recollection of many of you (Jatra\r\nMohan Babu nods his head)--it is within the recollection of our\r\ndistinguished Chairman--this falsehood originated in Colootolla in\r\nthe year 1906 or 1907. The falsity of this was demonstrated then, and\r\nnow in the year of grace, 1918, we find the truthful Editor of the\r\n_Bengalee_ newspaper referring to that lie and putting forward that lie\r\nas an argument against the popular party.\r\n\r\n \"We are told that we must fearlessly criticise the proposals, if they\r\n fall short of our ideal. But if they do not, what then?\"\r\n\r\nWell then, we accept it (Laughter). What is there to say about it? Then\r\nit goes on to say:\r\n\r\n \"The circular assumes that Mr. Montagu's proposals are bound to be\r\n unsatisfactory and that they will mean little or nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWhere does the Circular assume that? The Circular merely asserts that\r\nif it is, it is our bounden duty to protest against that. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nI need not read the rest of it. There is another passage which however\r\nI must read to you:\r\n\r\n \"Why then sound the tocsin of alarm and seek to create a prejudice\r\n for which so far as there is no warrant and against which there is a\r\n strong body of presumptive evidence. Why talk of fearless criticism\r\n and united front\"?\r\n\r\nThis comes from Mr. Surendranath Banerjea! Surely we are fallen on evil\r\ntimes!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD \"LEADER'S ADVICE TO THE PEOPLE.\"\r\n\r\nThen our editor goes on to say:\r\n\r\n \"If they are satisfactory they should be welcomed; if they are partly\r\n satisfactory they should be welcomed to that extent.\"\r\n\r\n(Never)\r\n\r\nAnd why?\r\n\r\n \"For the British public would then feel inclined to drop them\r\n altogether.\"\r\n\r\nTo drop them altogether! Now, gentlemen, you have seen what that\r\narticle is. The letter which was written by the Secretaries of the\r\nProvincial Congress Committee is merely put forward as an excuse.\r\nWhat is put forward before the people of Bengal is this; if it is\r\nsatisfactory, of course, we should accept it. If not? In the article\r\nwhich appeared the next day, he made his position clearer. He said\r\nthe difficulty is this: The Europeans are clamouring against it--the\r\nIndo-European Association in England is fighting against it--and if\r\nyou, the people of Bengal say that you do not want it, why the British\r\npeople will say 'then drop it altogether.' My answer to that is: let it\r\nbe dropped if it is not satisfactory. Mr. Surendranath Banerjea admits\r\nit in this writing--let me quote his exact words:\r\n\r\n \"We quite admit that there have been many paper announcements in the\r\n past: and it is only too true that the pages of Anglo-Indian history\r\n are strewn broadcast with the fragments of broken pledges.\"\r\n\r\nLet it be another fragment of broken pledge; but let not the people of\r\nBengal consent to that! If their position is this: we will give you\r\nthis and no further, let them give what they choose; but is it for us\r\nto say what little of self-government you choose to give us is amply\r\nsufficient for us at the present day? I venture to think that you will\r\nnot accept such a proposition as that (No, no). We want self-government\r\nfor a purpose. We do not want that self-government which some people\r\nbrought up in European politics want--we do not want simply a weapon\r\nto fight against the bureaucracy--we have got tired of that and we\r\nsay for God's sake, let us have peace in Bengal. (cheers) Let us have\r\nsome sort of self-government which will enable us to look after the\r\nagricultural, industrial interests of the country, and to take up the\r\nwork of education and sanitation which will enable us to work for the\r\nreal good of the country without being obstructed at every step. That\r\nis why we want a change in the system of Government (cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BENGALEE'S\" WRITINGS BEFORE MR. BANERJEA WENT TO DELHI.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, supposing Mr. Montagu says you can't get all that,\r\ntake a little, just a little, a pinch. My position is this: I do not\r\nknow what others will say. I hope the people of this country will have\r\nthe courage to say: we want none of it, take it back: if we are to be\r\nslaves of the bureaucracy, if all our activities in every direction\r\nare to be controlled, and it may be, stifled at the sweet will and\r\npleasure of the bureaucracy, we want none of it. Take it back to\r\nEngland (cheers). We do not want it here. We want courage to say that,\r\nI admit. But what right have you to ask for Home Rule if you cannot\r\nhave the courage to say that--if you cannot have the courage to say to\r\nthe Government that we don't want it: it will not serve our purpose.\r\nWhat is the good of giving something to the people which they do not\r\nwant. Now, gentlemen, that I am right in taking this position I shall\r\ntry to show to you, if you will bear with me--(go on) from one or two\r\nextracts from the \"Bengalee\" newspaper, before a change came over the\r\nspirit of its dreams. I will read to you just two or three extracts\r\nfrom the \"Bengalee\"--not after March when the editor went to Delhi but\r\nbefore that in November and December, 1917. I quote from the \"Bengalee\"\r\nof November 2nd 1917:--\r\n\r\n \"Mr. Montagu will not be deceived by these tactics (of the\r\n anti-Congress-League party). He will know how to appraise them at\r\n their proper value. The British Cabinet consisting of politicians of\r\n the type of Lord Curzon and Lord Milner have decided that India is to\r\n have responsible government and that a substantial advance is to be\r\n made in that direction as soon as possible. There is no going back\r\n upon this announcement. It must be accepted as a settled policy, from\r\n which there can be no departure. Mr. Montagu is coming out to discuss\r\n the details and how best this policy can be carried out. It is no use\r\n saying \"we don't want responsible government; we are not fit for it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Surendranath Banerjea on November 2nd 1917. He says:--\r\n\r\n \"Those who breathe a word against it in this crisis of our national\r\n evolution are traitors to their country and their God.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Surendranath Banerjea on November 2nd, 1917. On 3rd\r\nNovember, 1917, the mood still continues:\r\n\r\n \"We want responsible government in full measure in connection with\r\n the Provincial Branches of administration, leaving untouched the\r\n Departments under the control of the Government of India in regard to\r\n which the Congress scheme should apply.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore what he wanted is responsible government in full measure in\r\nconnection with the provincial branches. On the 11th November, the\r\n\"Bengalee\" writes:\r\n\r\n \"In Bengal the feeling is--and we think that Bengal reflects the\r\n feeling of all India in this matter--that a full measure of provincial\r\n autonomy should be at once given with the reform of the Imperial\r\n Legislative Council of the India office as recommended by the Congress\r\n and the Muslim League. Nothing short of this will satisfy educated\r\n India.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Surendranath Banerjea on November 11th. If he is a leader\r\nof yesterday, let him remain true to that leadership (Hear, hear). As\r\nfor myself, standing on this platform to-day, I make a solemn promise\r\nto follow this leader if he remains true to what he was yesterday\r\n(cheers). I shall follow what Mr. Surendranath Banerjea said on\r\nNovember 11th, 1917 _viz._, that nothing short of this will satisfy\r\neducated India (loud cheers). Then on the 21st, November, he repeats\r\nthe same ideal:\r\n\r\n \"Courage is the first and last quality of real statesmanship. It was\r\n the crowning quality of Akbar, the greatest ruler that ever adorned a\r\n throne. Let our rulers take courage in both hands and great will be\r\n their reward.\"\r\n\r\nCourage is the first and last quality of real statesmanship! How have\r\nthe mighty fallen!\r\n\r\n\r\nNO SHAMS, NO DELUSIONS SAID MR. BANERJEA OF 1917.\r\n\r\nHe follows that up by saying on November 22nd:\r\n\r\n \"There must be no shams or shows or delusions. We have had too much of\r\n this commodity in the past.\"\r\n\r\nNo shams, no delusions. I follow the noble words of Mr. Surendranath\r\nBanerjea. I love them so much that I am prepared to follow his\r\nteachings. But if the Surendranath Banerjea of to-day does not follow\r\nthe S. N. Banerjea of yesterday is it my fault that I cannot follow\r\nhim? (laughter) I adore the Surendranath Banerjea of yesterday, but if\r\nhe cannot remain true to his trust I cannot be false to my faith. Hear\r\nthe leader of yesterday again:\r\n\r\n \"The Minto-Morley scheme, if it was not a dead failure, did not\r\n satisfy popular aspirations and was behind the growing requirements\r\n of the times. We hope the mistakes will not be repeated in the coming\r\n constitutional changes. Provincial autonomy must be the basis of\r\n the reforms, not an emasculated, half-hearted, system of Provincial\r\n self-government.\"\r\n\r\nNoble words again and I repeat them and I follow them.\r\n\r\n \"but in full measure with a full share of responsibility. The time for\r\n half-measures is past and gone.\"\r\n\r\nThen in the same article he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n \"The counsels of caution are often the counsels of timidity.\"\r\n\r\nMark these words, gentlemen. Then he says:\r\n\r\n \"If the Government will not make over the whole of the provincial\r\n administration to a popular Ministry responsible to a popular\r\n Assembly, let them at least, entrust to them such departments, as\r\n Education, Sanitation, Local Self-government, Police, etc.\"\r\n\r\nMark these words again. He includes the Police but I was told the other\r\nday that we ought not to take the Police; it is a difficult department\r\nto administer, (laughter).\r\n\r\nThen on the 27th of November, the \"Bengalee\" writes:\r\n\r\n \"The country is rushing at a giddy pace and Lord Morley's reforms have\r\n failed to meet the exigencies of the times which cannot be satisfied\r\n by anything short of a full measure of responsible government.\"\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n \"Any scheme that does not fully provide for this and secure full\r\n autonomous power for the provinces and falls short of the irreducible\r\n minimum put forth in the Congress-League scheme stands self-condemned\r\n and will totally fail to meet the wishes and requirements of the\r\n people and win their support.\"\r\n\r\nBut now he is urging the people of this country to support a scheme\r\nwhich may fall short of his ideal and he says even if it is not\r\nsatisfactory we should accept it. Even on the 29th of November he says:\r\n\r\n \"Any tinkering reform of a patch-work kind will not avail to meet the\r\n necessities of the situation but will rather intensify the present\r\n difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will not weary you with any more extracts but I will quote\r\njust two passages, for which I hope you will pardon me (go on, go on).\r\n\r\n\r\nSURENDRANATH OF DECEMBER, 1917.\r\n\r\nOn December 1st, Mr. Surendranath Banerjea says:\r\n\r\n \"Nothing less will satisfy the people of India or redeem the honour of\r\n England.... Real power must be given to us. No shams or delusions will\r\n satisfy us. We have had enough of them.... None of that taking away\r\n with the one hand what is given with the other.\"\r\n\r\nThen on the 2nd of December, he says:\r\n\r\n \"Let it be clearly understood that the Congress-League scheme\r\n represents the irreducible minimum which admits of no curtailment\r\n here or excision there and then which no more moderate demand can be\r\n conceived under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, gentlemen, that a scheme more moderate than the\r\nCongress League scheme can be conceived and Mr. Surendranath Banerjea\r\nof to-day has conceived that (laughter). Then on December 12th, he says:\r\n\r\n \"Too long have we been given the shadows of things--empty forms--which\r\n may please the infantile mind, but which the adolescent nation spurns\r\n away as a child's plaything.... Not only should justice be done, but\r\n that the people should be convinced of it, ... not only should the\r\n Government be satisfied, but that the people should be convinced that\r\n a substantial measure of responsible government has been granted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you will find similar expressions of his opinion in January\r\nand one or two in February. In March, Mr. Surendranath Banerjea went\r\nto Delhi and from that moment--well I am reminded of the \"Rake's\r\nprogress\"--I shudder to think of the last step--I think, we the\r\npeople of Bengal--we are entitled to ask for an explanation of this\r\nphenomenon. We are entitled to ask Sir Surendranath--I beg your pardon,\r\ngentlemen, I beg his pardon too--coming events cast their shadow before\r\nand I was caught in that shadow just for a moment--I think, gentlemen,\r\nwe are entitled to ask Mr. Surendranath why is it that yesterday he\r\nwas determined not to have any measure of self-government which was\r\nnot satisfactory, which was not responsible, which was not wide in\r\nits scope and why is it that to-day in the month of June, 1918, he is\r\nof opinion that whatever scheme the Secretary of State puts forward\r\nshould be accepted by the people--if it is satisfactory it should be\r\naccepted, if it is not satisfactory, even then it should be accepted\r\nbecause if we did not accept it, the British people might not grant\r\nanything at all. We want an explanation of this. He is the leader of\r\nBengal--he claims that. I am free to acknowledge that claim, but we the\r\npeople of Bengal who have loved him, followed him and honoured him, we\r\nwho had \"learnt his great language\" and \"caught his clear accents,\" we\r\nwho had followed him with all the devotion of our hearts, we who had\r\nlived \"in his mild and magnificent eye\" for the last 30 years, are we\r\nnot entitled to ask him to explain to us the inner significance the\r\ndeeper meaning of this change? (Hear hear,) It cannot be for \"a handful\r\nsilver,\" we are told, it is not for \"a riband to stick in his coat.\"\r\nWhat is it then?\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS IT TOUCH OF HAND OR TURN OF HEAD?\r\n\r\nWas there anything in the atmosphere of Delhi which brought about this\r\nchange--was it something said, something done?--was it touch of hand\r\nor turn of head? What was it? Was it the growing wisdom of old age?\r\nSurely some explanation is due from him to the people of Bengal and as\r\nfor his reasons, I have told you and I repeat: as long as I shall live\r\nI shall repeat that whether the people of England are willing or not\r\nwilling to grant us any reform, that will not induce me to accept it\r\nunless it recognises my natural right--a real scheme of reform means\r\nthe recognition of the natural rights of the people of this country\r\n(Loud cheers) I claim no favour. I stand on my right.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE STAND ON OUR RIGHTS\r\n\r\nWhat rights can the British people give me if I have not the claim\r\nwithin myself? Can man create rights? They can only recognise the\r\nrights which I have within me, the rights which belong to me, the\r\nrights which are given to me by God and rights which no man can take\r\naway. Unless you can satisfy that, unless you can make good that\r\nposition, neither the British Parliament, nor all the Parliaments of\r\nthe world will be able to confer on you things which do not belong to\r\nyou. Strive for the thing which belongs to you. Say to them manfully,\r\n\"this is my right\" and prove that assertion by the voice of the people,\r\nthe united voice of the nation (cheers). Prove that assertion and when\r\nyou have done that, is there any power in this world which can say,\r\nyou will not have that which belongs to you (cheers). They can only\r\nkeep it from you as long as you do not realise that it is yours. That\r\nwhich you realise as your own cannot be taken away from you. The moment\r\nyou realise this is your own, that moment that right will have to be\r\nrecognised and not a moment sooner. No half-measures will create that,\r\nno tinkering scheme of reforms has ever made a nation in the past and\r\nwill never make a nation in the future. Is it not Mr. Surendranath\r\nBanerjea who has repeated times without number that nations are by\r\nthemselves made (Loud Cheers)?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISDOM OF THE LEADER OF YESTERDAY\r\n\r\nWe have to make ourselves. Is this the way? This way which Mr.\r\nSurendranath Banerjea is now recommending, is this the way to make a\r\nnation? It is a critical period in our political history: there was\r\nno crisis in the history of India from the earliest times down to the\r\npresent which was more critical than this and at this critical time\r\nfor a leader of our people to say 'give us what little you think wise,\r\nwe, the people of this country will accept it.'--Is it politics? Is it\r\nwisdom? Or is it madness? Surely an explanation is due to the people.\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, take this to your heart to-day and make a solemn vow\r\nthat if you are fit for self-government, you have got to demonstrate\r\nthat. No words ever produced or created rights. Enactments are\r\nnothing. They simply recognise rights which exist. The rights belong\r\nto you if you only realise the position--they are not yours, if you\r\nhesitate (cheers). If you hesitate, you are lost. If you are afraid to\r\nrealise that you have rights you are not fit for self-government. The\r\nrights of nationality were never granted to a nation of cowards (hear,\r\nhear).\r\n\r\nI thank you again, gentlemen, for listening to me patiently. I had many\r\nthings more to say and if I find another opportunity I shall again\r\naddress you (cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT DENIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_At Chittagong on the 17th June 1918, under the auspices of the local\r\nHome Rule League, a meeting was held under the presidency of Babu Jatra\r\nMohan Sen, when Mr. C. R. Das delivered the following speech_:--\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen, I wish you had not insisted on my speaking\r\nto-night as I am anxious not to spoil the effect of the brilliant\r\naddress (of the Hon. Mr. Fazlul Huq) to which you have just listened\r\n(go on, go on). If I rise to respond to the call from the Chairman,\r\nI confess it is not without some hesitation. Gentlemen, Mr. Huq has\r\ndealt with the question of Home Rule from many points of view, with\r\nconsiderable force and with great eloquence. I desire to say that I\r\nam in complete agreement with everything that has fallen from him.\r\n(Cheers).\r\n\r\nYou will, however, permit me to-night to tell you a story--the story of\r\nthe great denial. The other day our distinguished Chairman said that\r\nwe are in the midst of a great crisis. I also said that the present\r\ncrisis of India is greater and more serious than any in her history.\r\nBut to-day I will tell you the story of the great denial. As a preface\r\nto my story I shall ask you to recall to your mind the principal\r\nincidents of our national history under British Rule. More than a\r\ncentury and a half have passed by and at the end of it we find that\r\nthe people of Bengal, the vast majority of them at any rate, are not\r\neducated and this want of education is put forward by the authorities\r\nas an argument against Home Rule. I have given this answer before and I\r\nrepeat it again--if they are not educated, whose fault is it? What have\r\nthe authorities been doing here for the last 150 years if they have\r\nnot succeeded in educating the people of this country? What excuse is\r\nthere for this failure? Is there a national government anywhere in the\r\nhistory of civilization, which after it took up the work of education,\r\ndid not finish and complete it within, say, 30 years? (Hear, hear).\r\nDo you doubt for a moment that if we get self-government now, we will\r\nbe able to educate the people of this country in another 20 years?\r\nBut why has not this been done by the Government? Let the Bureaucracy\r\nanswer--This is a chapter in the story of the great denial (Hear, hear).\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, take the question of agriculture in this country.\r\nThe Indian village-life was the envy of the world at one time. What\r\nare our villages now? How does our agriculture stand to-day? Has the\r\nGovernment done anything on that behalf during the last 150 years,\r\nwhich is at all worthy of a great nation and a great Government?\r\n(Cries of 'no,' 'no'). Yes, the answer must be 'no'. Why not? Because\r\nagriculture does not directly concern the bureaucracy of this country.\r\nIt may be necessary to start a department and call it department of\r\nagriculture in the interest of the bureaucracy. That has been done--one\r\nor two colleges which are not suited to our requirements have been\r\nestablished. But has agriculture improved? I do not know whether in\r\nthe interest of the Bureaucracy it is necessary that it should. But it\r\nis necessary for us. It is a matter of vital importance to the nation\r\nthat the cultivators of Bengal should prosper and live better lives\r\n(hear, hear). It is a matter of supreme importance to those who want\r\nself-government or swaraj in this country (hear, hear). We must look\r\nforward to the whole Bengalee nation. We must work persistently, we\r\nmust look forward to the day when the Bengalees as a nation, Hindus\r\nand Mahomedans, all together, will stand before the world in all the\r\nglory of nationality (cheers). I say therefore the question is of vital\r\nimportance from the point of view of the nation. Who are the people\r\nof Bengal? Not we, who conduct cases in court, not those who sit as\r\nmagistrates and judges. But who are they? It is those who cultivate\r\nthe land--they are the real nation (cheers) and if ever this country\r\nrises--by God's grace, rise it must--and takes its place amongst\r\nthe nations of the world (Loud cheers)--well, long before that, the\r\nagriculture of this country must be improved. That is one of the\r\nreasons why we want Home rule. This is another chapter in the story of\r\nthe great denial (hear, hear).\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, what is the story of our commerce and industry? I do\r\nnot desire to begin from the beginning. I will not recall to mind or\r\nhelp you to recall to your mind the history of the destruction of our\r\ntrade and the annihilation of our industries. Let the dead past bury\r\nits dead. But what about the living? What has the Government done to\r\nencourage Commerce and Industry in recent years? It is the crying\r\nneed of the hour--the peculiar circumstances of this country demand a\r\nsolution of this problem. Has the bureaucracy done anything in this\r\nmatter? It is the duty of every civilized government to lend a helping\r\nhand and thus encourage the growth of Commerce and Industry. Can the\r\nBureaucracy lay its hand on its breast and say that it has fulfilled\r\nits trust? The answer must be 'no'. That is another reason why we want\r\nHome Rule, and gentlemen, that is another chapter in the story of the\r\ngreat denial (hear, hear).\r\n\r\nDo you want proof? For agriculture, the Government spends only 24 lacs\r\nof rupees out of Bengal's share of land-revenue which is 1-1/2 crores.\r\nWhat do the Government do with that money? The Bureaucracy says we\r\nwho want Home Rule are not fit to represent the people! What has the\r\nGovernment done for them? They spend only 24 lacs of rupees or rather\r\nmisspend it. Have any improvements been effected? That is the test. It\r\nis possible to have highly paid European agricultural officers without\r\nagricultural improvements.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly what has happened!\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE MILLION SOULS LOST IN FIVE YEARS\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, what about sanitation? Shall I tell you the story of\r\nhow the people are dying in this country for want of sanitation for the\r\nlast few years? Listen to these figures.\r\n\r\n  In 1911-12--9 lacs of people died of malaria alone\r\n  In 1912-13--9·59         \"         \"         \"\r\n  In 1913-14--9·65         \"         \"         \"\r\n  In 1914-15--10·61        \"         \"         \"\r\n  In 1915-16--10·64        \"         \"         \"\r\n\r\nSo in five years we have had five million victims (Cries of Oh!) for\r\nwant of sanitation in this country. Five million men in five years!\r\nMore than the combined army of Great Britain and Ireland to-day! (Cries\r\nof Oh!) We have had representations and opinions of experts and a few\r\nexperiments but what has really been done up to now? Are we to believe\r\nthat this fell disease could not have been eradicated if the Government\r\nhad taken active steps in that direction? Do you believe, gentlemen\r\nthat if the government is nationalised--effectively nationalised--we\r\ncannot get rid of this disease? It is a matter of supreme importance\r\nto us, to the growing nationality of Bengal. It means that every\r\nyear there is an increase in the number of deaths, it means want of\r\nstrength, it means decrease of national vitality, it means that at\r\nnot a very distant day we will be reduced to such a condition that it\r\nwill be impossible to regenerate us. (hear, hear). I have given you\r\nonly the number of people who die every year. But do we not see all\r\nover the whole country malaria-stricken people living by chance as\r\nit were--carrying on by some means or other, their miserable load of\r\nexistence? The whole of Bengal is full of these people and yet what has\r\nthe Government done? ('Nothing') Yes, practically nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n_Three Annas per Head per Year._\r\n\r\nLet me give you the figures regarding education which is very\r\ninteresting. The average amount spent by the Government is 85 lacs of\r\nrupees for education. The population of Bengal is 450 lacs, _i.e._,\r\n5 persons per rupee per year. It means three annas per head per year\r\nspent for the noble cause of education! (laughter) It means again\r\none pice per head per month! (Shame). And we are told that England's\r\nduty in India is to spread education so that the degraded people of\r\nthe country may be elevated! (laughter) And three annas per head per\r\nyear is spent for this noble cause! But don't you think these are\r\npurely educational expenses. It also includes the cost of building\r\n(Laughter). It includes the cost of inspection which exceeds the pay of\r\nthe teachers (Shame). You can well imagine what is left for education\r\nproper. Talk of education gentlemen? Who cares for education? Not the\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ENCOURAGEMENT OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY--MR. SWAN'S\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\nWith regard to expenditure on commerce and industry, well, you may say\r\nvery little, practically nothing is spent. I will simply quote to you\r\nthe observations of a member of the Indian Civil Service, Mr. J. Swan,\r\nwho has written a report on the industrial condition of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\"While the industrial development of the province must depend on\r\nprivate enterprise I think the encouragement of Government might take a\r\nmore active form than it has hitherto done.\"\r\n\r\nEncouragement of the Government might take a more active form! Well,\r\nyou cannot expect a member of the Civil Service to write more than\r\nthat. Then again:--\r\n\r\n\"Adequate capital is particularly necessary in case of industries run\r\nby Indian capital and under Indian management owing to the reluctance\r\nof banks and of firms to give them credit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. Swan writes. You may gather therefore that very little\r\nis done for industry and commerce. Now that is the position. This\r\nstate of things went on for years. We were sleeping. At the end of\r\nevery year we used to hold a meeting of the Congress and beyond that\r\nwe had no kind of activity. But from the year 1905, there was a great\r\nactivity in this country which we called the Swadeshi movement. And we\r\nfind from that time the Government indulged in a series of repressive\r\nmeasures and I believe those repressive measures in their turn gave\r\nrise to a party in Bengal, who are described by the Government\r\nas anarchists but who are, I venture to think, not anarchists at\r\nall--they are revolutionaries. I do not for a moment suggest that\r\nthe methods which they employ are good or ought to be encouraged but\r\nthey are not anarchists. It is not that they want to do away with all\r\nGovernment--what they want to do is to change the system of government\r\n(hear, hear). So far as I have been able to judge the object of these\r\nso called anarchists is not different from the object of the Congress\r\nor the Moslem League. The only difference lies in the method which\r\nthey pursue. They pursue methods which are subversive of law and\r\norder whereas the Congress-League adopts methods which are legal.\r\nThis is the only difference. The methods they pursue are deserving\r\nof severe condemnation but I think it is a great injustice to call\r\nthem anarchists. Be that as it may--I say that after these repressive\r\nmeasures, one after another, in rapid succession--we have in our midst\r\na revolutionary party in Bengal.\r\n\r\nNow, it has been often said that we are not fit for self-government\r\nbecause of the existence of this revolutionary party. My answer is:\r\nI do not deny that there is a revolutionary party. I admit it and I\r\nsay that no government which is not a national government will ever\r\nbe able to put a stop to this revolutionary movement. What do these\r\npeople want? They want freedom. They want to change the system of\r\ngovernment. I told you just now that their object is the same as that\r\nof the Congress and the Moslem League. I go further and I say that\r\ntheir object--not their methods--is now recognised as legitimate\r\nby the British Cabinet. In August last year, the British Cabinet\r\ndeclared that some kind of responsible government should be introduced\r\ninto this country. What does that mean? It means that the system of\r\ngovernment which obtains now, which is bureaucratic, should be changed\r\nor otherwise it is an admission on the part of our masters--after all\r\nit is the British Cabinet who are our masters and not the Bureaucracy\r\nhere--it is an admission on the part of our masters that a change of\r\ngovernment, of the bureaucratic system of government is necessary for\r\nthe welfare of India. I say the object of the so-called anarchists is\r\nnot only the same as that of the Congress and the League but it is an\r\nobject which is recognised and sanctioned by the highest authority in\r\nEngland. Therefore, gentlemen, I say, as I have said elsewhere, that\r\nthe only way you can put a stop to this revolutionary movement is by\r\nrecognising that simple fact that the people of this country--they\r\nare hungry for Freedom--should be given what they want and I say the\r\nmoment you give freedom to the people, there will be an end of this\r\nrevolutionary movement (hear, hear). It has been pointed out over\r\nand over again, but the Bureaucracy will not listen. Gentlemen, that\r\nis the position of affairs to-day. Our agriculture neglected, our\r\neducation neglected, sanitation neglected, industry and commerce not\r\nseriously considered and along with that we have got a revolutionary\r\nmovement in this country. This is the present situation and it is upon\r\nthat that a memorable declaration was made by the British Cabinet\r\nin August last year. Now, gentlemen, what have we to say to that? I\r\ndesire to place before you clearly what I mean: Your declaration goes\r\none way and your action goes another way. That is the real grievance\r\nof the people of this country. Tell us, if you want, 'you are not fit\r\nfor self-government, we will not give you self-government.' I can\r\nunderstand that position. I respect plain speaking. I am fond of plain\r\nspeaking. Let the bureaucracy say in clear terms 'we cannot afford to\r\ngive you responsible government. We want to have this government as\r\nbureaucratic as ever.' 'You can get a little change here and there,\r\npolitical lolipops with which you can amuse yourselves. But we will\r\nnot give you responsible government'--let them so declare, if they\r\nlike, and we will then drop this political agitation. Our difficulty\r\nis this: We believe in the words of the Declaration and in that belief\r\nwe have been devising schemes, holding meetings to consider schemes\r\nof self-government and to consider what would be the best form of\r\nself-government, in this country and to help the Government with our\r\nsuggestions so that the British Parliament may consider this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW GOVERNMENT HAS TREATED HOME RULERS' PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, when things were going on in that way we had another\r\ndeclaration, a more memorable message from the Prime Minister, in\r\nwhich the Prime Minister asked our help at the time of a great crisis,\r\nasked us to avert a great danger which threatened England and which\r\nthreatened India. Now what did we do under the circumstance? We held\r\nmeetings again and we told the Government that at this juncture 'you\r\nmust have one united India, you must create an enthusiasm in this\r\ncountry, real enthusiasm which will lead people to make every sacrifice\r\nfor the country and for the empire' and we asked the Government to do\r\naway with the repressive measures, to release the political suspects\r\nand the political prisoners (loud cheers). The whole country regards\r\nthat as an oppression. We said to the Government. Do away with that\r\noppression: Make a definite proposal about self-government and you\r\nwill have the whole country with you. You will have hundreds and\r\nthousands of soldiers fighting for you, fighting for India, fighting\r\nfor the Empire--you will have the gold of the rich and the copper of\r\nthe poor--every sacrifice that may be required of the people will be\r\nwillingly, ungrudgingly, cheerfully made for the service of the country\r\nand for upholding the glory of the empire (cheers). How was that\r\naccepted by the bureaucracy? I must confess to a sense of hopelessness\r\nthat Government paid not the slightest attention to it. Shortly after\r\nthat there was the Conference at Delhi. Let me quote to you the words\r\nof His Excellency the Viceroy, words in which he pictures the great\r\ndanger which threatens us:\r\n\r\n\"Germany has already thrown out into Central Asia her pioneers of\r\nintrigue, her agents of disintegration. The lesson she has learnt from\r\nthe Russian Revolution that a stronger weapon than all the armaments\r\nthat money can buy or science devise is the disruption of an enemy by\r\nhis own internal forces.\"\r\n\r\nThen later on,\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken of the cause. I have told you of the death-grip on the\r\nwestern front and have unfolded to you the story of German machinations\r\nin the East.\"\r\n\r\nWe were ready to help the Government when we were told that a great\r\ndanger threatened the whole of the British Empire and India. That\r\ndanger is admitted by His Excellency the Viceroy, it was suggested\r\nby the message of the Prime Minister. It was admitted and if I may\r\nhave the impertinence of saying, clearly and eloquently described by\r\nHis Excellency the Viceroy. But what about our suggestions? Is it not\r\na fact that whenever we are anxious to give the bureaucracy in this\r\ncountry good advice, sane advice, advice which is necessary for the\r\nwelfare not only of this country but of England also, the welfare of\r\nthe whole empire, that advice is received with scorn and contempt? What\r\ndoes the Viceroy say? After describing the difficulty which threatens\r\nus, His Excellency says:\r\n\r\n\"We can, I believe, best do so (help the Amir to keep his ship\r\nstraight) by showing our enemies first that India is solid as a rock.\"\r\n\r\nI pause here for a moment. That must be done. It is admitted by His\r\nExcellency the Viceroy that, at this juncture we must do something by\r\nwhich we can present to the enemy a united India, an India which is\r\nsolid as a rock. How does he propose to do that? How can India be solid\r\nas a rock unless she is strong in her rights, how can anybody expect\r\nIndia to stand solid as a rock unless she has got the elementary rights\r\nof citizenship, unless she can say 'I am one in this world'? (Cheers).\r\nThe Viceroy says:--\r\n\r\n\"We can, I believe, best do so by showing our enemies first that\r\nIndia is solid as a rock, and that the lambent flame of anarchical\r\nintrigue will find nothing inflammable in this country, nay, rather\r\nwill be smothered and extinguished forthwith should it approach, by the\r\ndeadweight of our unity of purpose.\"\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, so far, there is nothing in the speech of His\r\nExcellency the Viceroy from which we have any reason to differ. But in\r\nthe same speech His Excellency disposes of our suggestions in this way:\r\n\r\n\"But in these days of stress and strain it is idle to ask men to come\r\ntogether who disagree on first principles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDO WE DISAGREE ON FIRST PRINCIPLES?\r\n\r\nI pause for a moment. Do we disagree--we the nationalists of India, do\r\nwe disagree from the Viceroy on any question of first principles? I\r\nventure to think, not. What have we done? We have believed the Message\r\nof Hope left to us by His Majesty the King personally--we have believed\r\nthat that message will be fulfilled--we have had the declaration of\r\nthe British Cabinet in that behalf and we believed that Responsible\r\nGovernment would be introduced. We have had the message from the Prime\r\nMinister asking for our help and sympathy, asking for help in men and\r\nmoney. We have told the Government that in order to do this, the\r\nrepressive measures must be withdrawn, political prisoners must be set\r\nfree and a definite scheme of self-government must be put forward.\r\nWhat were we trying to do? Were we not trying to give effect to the\r\nmessage of the British Cabinet? Were we not giving a real response to\r\nthe message of the Prime Minister? (Cheers). Why should it be said\r\nthat we differ from the Viceroy on questions of first principles. What\r\nare the questions of first principles? It is statements like these\r\nwhich fill us with suspicion and alarm. Do they want that the King's\r\nMessage will for ever remain unfulfilled and unredeemed?--That the\r\nDeclaration of the British Parliament will remain a declaration and\r\nnothing but a Declaration to the end of the chapter?--Does it come\r\nto this: that whatever declaration is made the bureaucracy has made\r\nup its mind not to let responsible government be introduced in this\r\ncountry? What difference in first principles can there be, I ask, when\r\nall our endeavours have been to give effect to the Message of the Prime\r\nMinister?\r\n\r\nThen His Excellency goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"While they are wrangling over those, while the house is burning, there\r\nare those who would exploit England's difficulty. I believe that these\r\npeople gravely misinterpret India's attitude. I am sure that there are\r\nnone here who will countenance such a policy. There are those, again,\r\nwho would wish to bargain. Again I decline to believe that anyone has\r\ncome to this Conference in a huckstering spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIS WHAT GOVERNMENT DOING NOT BARGAINING?\r\n\r\nThere are those who would wish to bargain, that is to say, when we are\r\nsuggesting to the Government in all seriousness that certain measures\r\nare necessary for carrying out the Prime Minister's Message we are told\r\nthat it is bargaining, that we want to exploit England's difficulty!\r\nWhat is England doing now? This is a simple fact and I do not wish to\r\nconceal it. What is our interest in the war? Our only interest is our\r\ncountry. What is England doing now? England asks us to help her in\r\nthis war. And why should we help her? If we are to help her, we must\r\nfirst of all feel that this country is our own country (Cheers)--that\r\nIndia has in fact and not in name, her rightful place in the British\r\nEmpire (Loud Cheers). That is what we say. That is what great statesmen\r\nin England have said again and again. If this is your real intention,\r\ntell the people so--tell them \"it is your own country, manage your own\r\naffairs and defend your own country\" and you will then see what we\r\ncan do (Hear, Hear). The only thing that we want is to feel that this\r\nis our country. If it is not our country, what does it matter to us?\r\n(Cheers). If it is our country it affects us; it affects our personal\r\ninterests, it affects our selfish interests, it affects our future--and\r\nwe are ready for any sacrifice. You say that we want to exploit\r\nEngland's difficulty. And if we say that England is exploiting at this\r\ntime our helplessness, that would at once be condemned as unwise and\r\nunworthy. Those who wish to realise themselves, those who wish to make\r\nthe people of this country realise that India is their own country,\r\nthat India is a part, an integral part--not shadowy or imaginary but\r\na real part of the British Empire--well, they are to be condemned as\r\npersons who would exploit England's difficulty (Shame). That is how the\r\nConference was held at Delhi.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF BENGAL'S ADVICE.\r\n\r\nFrom Delhi we come to Bengal. There again we have the speech of\r\nHis Excellency the Governor. His Excellency advised us--he did not\r\ncommand--His Excellency advised us that we should stop all political\r\nagitation at the present moment and he gave two reasons for it. One\r\nreason is this:\r\n\r\n\"Now let me give you my first reason. We have always been slow as a\r\npeople, as in Great Britain and India to realise how closely the enemy\r\nkeeps his eye upon us how quick he is to note our actions, indeed our\r\nvery words, and what a difference it makes to his own morals whether\r\nhe sees arrayed against him the serried ranks of a united people or\r\nwhether he detects or thinks he detects in this part of the Empire or\r\nin that some note of dissension, some indication of lack of unity of\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, do not show that you are wanting in a unity of purpose. I\r\nwas thinking what His Excellency really meant because it seems to\r\nme that we are in complete agreement with what His Excellency said.\r\nThat is the very reason for which we made the suggestions. Let not the\r\nenemy think that England is not united in its purpose and that India is\r\nnot prepared to take its place in the fight. That is the very reason\r\nfor which we suggested that all causes which led to resentment of the\r\npeople of this country and drew them away from this united purpose\r\nshould be removed--that the people of this country should be allowed to\r\nfeel that India is their own country, that it is their birthright to\r\ndefend their own country, that it is their right, not right alone but\r\nit is their proud privilege to fight the common enemy. His Excellency\r\nsaid we should do nothing so that the enemy could think that we are not\r\nunited. My answer is: Make us united. It can be done with a stroke of\r\nthe pen to-morrow if you really want to do it (Hear, Hear). If you do\r\nthat, the enemy will detect no lack of unity of purpose. It is possible\r\nto make it appear that there is no lack of unity of purpose.--Is it\r\nnot a hundred times more desirable that there should be real unity of\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\n\r\nIF THE KAISER CAME TO CALCUTTA?\r\n\r\n\"If the Kaiser came to Calcutta what would all the talk of freedom of\r\nindividual, of the liberty of the subject, of the right of this people\r\nor that people to self-determination, of this constitutional reform or\r\nthat constitutional reforms--what would be the value of all such talk\r\nif the Kaiser came to Calcutta?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, I say, we are in complete agreement with His Excellency, the\r\nGovernor of Bengal. I believe, if the Kaiser came to this country\r\nto-morrow there would be no talk of liberty of the subject, of the\r\nright of freedom of the individual and of constitutional rights and\r\nthat is the very reason why I am personally interested in not letting\r\nthe Kaiser come to Calcutta (Laughter) and that is the very reason why\r\nwe have been asking the Government again and again, why our leaders\r\nhave asked the Government repeatedly, to do away with these repressive\r\nmeasures to call forth loyalty, not lip-loyalty but real and genuine\r\nloyalty--not loyalty to the Bureaucracy but to the Empire. You cannot\r\ncall that up by sweet words alone, we want deeds--and as I say, this\r\ncan be done by a stroke of the pen to-morrow if you really want to do\r\nit. (Hear, Hear and Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMUST WE FEEL TO ORDER?\r\n\r\nHis Excellency advanced another reason. It is this:--\r\n\r\n\"The British people have a temper of their own. Some people call\r\nthem a stubborn and a stiff-necked race. They are, I believe, a fair\r\nand a just people. You can without difficulty reason with them, you\r\ncan without difficulty excite their interest, excite their sympathy\r\nand above all, you can excite their gratitude. But they are people,\r\nbelieve me, who resent, perhaps more deeply than any other people on\r\nthis earth any suspicion that anybody is bent upon making an attempt to\r\ntake advantage of them when their backs are against the wall.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, gentlemen, what does it come to? We must consider that\r\nwicked capacity of the German people who are for ever on their watch\r\nto find out a flaw in the constitution of this country. You must also\r\nregard the temperament of the British nation, who will be angry if you\r\nwant your rights at this juncture, but the only people whose interests\r\nand whose sentiments are to be set at naught are the Indian people\r\n(Shame). We are not men! We are not a race! Our feeling need not be\r\nconsidered--our sentiments are nothing! Our feelings must be those of\r\nour masters. We must feel to order and suppress our real feelings!\r\n(Shame).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT OBEDIENCE TO THE BUREAUCRACY BUT LOYALTY TO THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, I must say that I have read this part of His\r\nExcellency's speech with considerable pain. It is the duty of the\r\nGovernment, here, to consult and to consider the sentiments of the\r\npeople. The people of this country are loyal to the Empire. They may\r\nnot like the bureaucracy and they do not. And the British Cabinet\r\nhas declared that the people are not wrong when they say that the\r\nBureaucracy has mismanaged matters. They do not like the Bureaucracy,\r\nand for sufficient reasons; but they are loyal to the Empire. Again,\r\nmy earnest appeal to the Government is: \"Take care, do not disregard\r\nthe people's sentiments. Do not wish to substitute obedience to the\r\nBureaucracy in place of the people's loyalty to the Empire. The people\r\nof this country are impatient and they will not bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake let this be the last chapter in the story of the great\r\ndenial.\" (Loud Cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_There was a huge meeting of students of Bangabashi and Ripon colleges\r\non the 14th January 1921, at Mirzapur Park, when Mr. Das said_:\r\n\r\nSrijut Chittaranjan Das, who, on rising to speak, was given a very\r\nhearty ovation said \"I am unable to deliver any speech to-day. My heart\r\nis full, and my voice is choked and I have not power and strength\r\nenough to express the feelings that are surging in my mind to-day. God\r\nhas not given me power to express in language the happiness that you\r\nhave given me by coming out of your Colleges. I feel it in my heart of\r\nhearts that, those of you who have come out, are greater than any of us\r\nhere, and I humbly bow to you--to the manifestation of strength that\r\nyou have displayed to-day. I want you to realise that,--to realise the\r\nstrength in you. It is not yours--it is not human, it is the will--the\r\ndivine will of the country and the God of our being. It is the will\r\nof _Deshamabrika_ that has been manifested through you. What, she is,\r\nI do not know, but she is the Goddess of our Nation. I now can say\r\nwith head erect--blessed be thy waters, Mother Bengal, blessed be thy\r\ntrees--blessed be thy sons.\r\n\r\nI know people will call you mad. People call me mad too. But who are\r\nmad really? Are not the merchants and traders who are running after\r\nwealth and rolling in luxury--the lawyers and their clients who\r\nspend their all and are ruined by litigation--is it not they who are\r\nreally mad? Whatever people may call you--you have got to realise the\r\ntruth that is in you. Do stand upon that and stick to it, whatever\r\ndifficulties may come or whatever sufferings may await you in the path.\r\nDark and difficult are the ways, but Divine Light will guide you. Give\r\nup all weakness of the heart. Man can do everything. Remember we are\r\nmen determined to emancipate our Motherland from bondage. Should we not\r\nbe able to deliver her from the shackles that bind her?\r\n\r\nWe shall rather go ignorant than be educated in those schools and\r\ncolleges. We want to be educated according to our own standard of\r\nliving, keeping harmony with our past culture and tradition. I do not\r\nknow what Bolshevism is. We want to realise what is truth--what is\r\neternal--what is in our blood--for the salvation of our country. I want\r\nthat. I do not want Bolshevism--I do not want industrialism. In short,\r\nI do not want Europeanism. I want to be a free man, and be myself\r\nagain. If that is truth, depending upon that truth, fear not.\r\n\r\nAnother word, and I have done. I promise before you all, to-day, that,\r\nwithin fifteen days or utmost a month, we shall have a College--a\r\nNational College established, of which there is no equal here, and\r\nwhere you will get your national education, where you will learn to\r\nlove your country and appreciate freedom. I want to see that edifice\r\nstanding on the road-side of Goldighi pulled down brick by brick.\"\r\n\r\nHe concluded by saying that even the Medical Students also must come\r\nout. They would rather go, he said, without doctors than get the help\r\nof those who come out of that Institution aided by the Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Achyutaram of Bangabashi College said that he hailed from Andhra\r\nand they learnt all their national lessons at the feet of Bengal. When\r\nthey saw that Bengal had not been doing anything they were getting\r\ndisheartened. Now that Bengal was coming to herself again, he would\r\nbe able to tell his fellow-countrymen in Andhra that things were all\r\nright in Bengal. Sriman Nagendranath Ghose said he was a student of\r\nRipon College 1st year sec. B. When they were holding their meeting in\r\nthe class about Non-Co-operation, a professor of the College remarked\r\nthat the students were going to listen to the advice of \"damned.\"--The\r\nstudents ought to strike for that if for nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe President, in bringing the proceedings to a close, said, that it\r\nhad been already announced that a meeting would take place in College\r\nSquare at 6 a.m. on Friday. A meeting would also be held at Mirzapur\r\nPark, in the afternoon at 4-30 p.m. on the same day. He hoped that\r\non the following day all students from the remaining colleges would\r\ncome out. Medical Colleges and Engineering Colleges were not to be\r\nmade exceptions in this matter. The Carmichael Medical College also\r\nshould be emptied. If they could boycott the examination, the bankrupt\r\nUniversity would come down in a day. When Post-Graduate and Law\r\nstudents were coming out, he felt convinced, that no one would attend\r\nthe convocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have to repeat the Message of Freedom. I have been often asked\r\n\"what is the meaning of this movement.\" To my mind, the meaning is\r\nparticularly clear. We want Freedom. We want to realise the right of\r\nregulating our own lives. We want to realise the right of building up\r\nthe great Indian Nation. We want to compel the bureaucracy to recognise\r\nthat right.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer to the past. It is not my desire to\r\nperpetuate bitterness. It is my desire to strengthen our determination\r\nto achieve our freedom.\r\n\r\nI advocate the method of Non-Co-operation, as every other method has\r\nfailed. I want you to cling to this method, come what may. This is our\r\nlast chance and this, at least, will not be in vain.\r\n\r\nDo you understand what Non-Co-operation means? You must withdraw your\r\nhelp in moving the powerful machinery of the bureaucracy. Do you\r\nrealise how you can move this machinery? The bureaucracy works its\r\nwicked will through the pleaders, through doctors, through clerks,\r\nthrough their police officers and through Magistrates and Judges. And\r\nyou now see what the Calcutta University contributes. It contributes\r\nall the strength upon which the strength of the bureaucracy depends.\r\n\r\nI appeal to you to take away your hands from the wheel of this\r\nmachinery. The first thing, therefore, is to come out of the Colleges.\r\nI make no distinction between the Medical students, between the\r\nstudents of the Engineering Colleges and other students. The problem\r\nis not of education, but of Non-co-operation. If you have this in\r\nview, how can there be any distinction between classes of students?\r\nIs it not clear that all students contribute to the strength of the\r\nbureaucracy? And is it possible to defeat this bureaucracy without\r\ntaking away that help? I have heard arguments based on humanitarian\r\nground; but every humanitarian ground must yield to the supreme\r\nnecessity of the moment. There is some inconvenience, some apparent\r\nwant of humanitarian consideration, in every great war. Is it possible\r\nthat this great war, based on peaceful method as it is, should steer\r\nclear of all inconveniences? I do not believe that there will be any\r\nthe more suffering, because of the withdrawal of medical students. I\r\nhave given it my anxious thought, and my decision is clear. But even\r\nif it does involve great suffering, I should welcome that suffering,\r\nrather, than leave one stone in its place in the edifice of a monstrous\r\nEducation. No, my dear friend, do not delude yourselves. It is easy\r\nto quote Scripture to cover your weakness. Believe me, it is not the\r\nhumanitarian ground which is keeping you away, but the imaginary\r\nprospects of worldly advancement which are dangled before your eyes.\r\nThe method that I advocate is the method of sacrifice. If you have to\r\ndestroy what you consider your chance of success in life, remember, it\r\nis only to defeat the bureaucracy, and to attain Swaraj. How can Swaraj\r\nbe attained unless you realise your own right clearly, unhesitatingly?\r\nHow can you compel the bureaucracy to recognise, that, which you\r\nyourself do not realise?\r\n\r\nDo not listen to those who make careful calculations and tell you that\r\nthis movement is bound to fail. I warn you against such doubts and\r\nhesitations. Even if the students do not realise their rights and their\r\nduty, the work of Non-co-operation will go on. But I admit that you may\r\nmake it more difficult by refusing to join us.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Freedom has never been won in the history of the world\r\nwithout sacrifice. The armed organizations of powerful bureaucracies,\r\nall over the world, have made armed resistance well nigh impossible.\r\nBut the Soul is ever free, and he who is free in his mind can never be\r\nenslaved. I want you to turn away your face from Europe and from the\r\norganization which is of European character. I want you to concentrate\r\nyour vision on the things which truly belong to us. The very simplicity\r\nof our life has become difficult of comprehension, because of the\r\ntortuous and complex organization which European culture and education\r\nhave placed before us. Once you turn your face away from that, you\r\nwill have faith in methods which belong to us in standards which are\r\nreally part of our blood and of our bones. What is more simple than the\r\ndesire and the determination to withdraw your help from that which is\r\nfalse and unrighteous? And yet why do you experience such difficulties\r\nin forming that desire and in fixing that determination? The answer is\r\nagain the same, _viz._, that Monster of education which is rearing up\r\nits head in defiance, as it were, of everything which belongs to us and\r\nwhich is dear to our hearts.\r\n\r\nI repeat again--Wake up, wake up, wake up. We have slept too long.\r\nRealise the sense of your bondage and stand out boldly and firmly on\r\nthe road to Freedom.--_The Servant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monster public meeting was held at Mirzapur Square on 21st January,\r\n'21 after Mahatma Gandhi's address to the Students. Mr. C. R. Das, when\r\nasked to speak, was given a great ovation and said:--_\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is impossible for me, to-night, to make a speech to you,\r\nas my voice has not yet recovered. I desire to say only this--that\r\nthere is but one duty before you at the present moment. Those of you\r\nwho have left your Colleges do not go back or you bring discredit on\r\nthe country, not only on Bengal but on the whole of India. Remember,\r\nthe success of this movement is in your hands. I said that, the\r\nfirst day I addressed you, and that, I say to-night, again, that the\r\nsuccess of this movement is in your hands. We want non-co-operation,\r\nwe want all Government Institutions--educational or otherwise--should\r\nbe boycotted. The question to-day is of educational institutions. Do\r\nnot believe those who say that the Calcutta University is a National\r\nUniversity or can even become the National University of Bengal. Avoid\r\nthat reasoning because it is a false reasoning. The national character\r\nof an educational Institution does not lie in the fact as to whether\r\nthe Professors are Indians or Europeans. The national character of\r\nthe educational Institutions, to-day, depends on one fact, whether it\r\nis, or it is not, connected with the Bureaucratic Government of this\r\ncountry. That is the only test. They lead you astray. I speak with\r\nall the conviction there is in my heart, they lead you astray. Who\r\nsay, that this College, Science College or that College or the other\r\nColleges which are manned by Indians are National Institutions? They\r\nare not. They are Bureaucratic institutions and before we attain Swaraj\r\nthis University, there, a few minutes walk from here, has got to come\r\ndown. The youths of Bengal must make that perfectly clear. They have\r\ntaken the first step. The second step is to continue in this boycott.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question of National University. I told you the first\r\nday that, it is not necessary for Swaraj to have national Universities,\r\nbut if you want them it is in your hand; and if you want them, and if\r\nyou come out, I promise you a national University. I am here to make\r\ngood that promise (hear, hear.) Nothing will deter me from fulfilling\r\nmy promise. But, if you expect me to carry out my promise, may I not\r\nexpect you to stand firm? (hear, hear). May I not expect you to be\r\nbrave, to be true to yourselves and to shun those institutions you have\r\nset your face against?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I am taking a list of two classes of students of those who\r\nwant to work for the country. The gospel of spinning wheel, which my\r\nrevered leader Mahatma Gandhi has given you to-day, is a Gospel which\r\nIndia has heard before, but which, unfortunately for ourselves, India\r\nhas forgotten, and it is not without pride that I am able to tell you\r\nto-day that, the curriculum which we were drawing up for the National\r\nUniversity, makes the art of spinning and weaving a compulsory subject\r\n(hear, hear) for all students; but those who want to work for the\r\ncountry must not only learn spinning and weaving, but they must also be\r\ntrained in that particular work and it requires, at least, two months'\r\ntraining in the National University which I am anxious to build up on\r\nyour behalf.\r\n\r\nI have, also, made a second list of students who had told me that\r\nthey want to continue their studies for whom I am providing or trying\r\nto provide. Always, remember, when I say I am doing this, I mean you\r\nare doing it. I told you the other day, my strength comes from your\r\nstrength. I am nothing if you are not prepared. I have got the strength\r\nof a million men if you are ready.\r\n\r\nWhat am I? I am at your hands to-day for establishing this National\r\nUniversity. But do not be under the impression that this university\r\nwill be a replica of that monster of education which rears up its\r\nhead over there. It is to be nothing like it; you will see that,\r\nwhen you study that curriculum which we are preparing, you must not\r\nexpect luxuries. But I can assure that any student who studies in the\r\nNational University for two years or even three years--I do not propose\r\nto have students in our institution for more than 3 or 4 or 5 years\r\nbeginning from the age of eight or seven--and those who come out from\r\nour institutions, you will find, will be educated, will be recognizable\r\nas Indians, will be educated as Indians should be educated and will not\r\nbe copyists of European maxims and European culture generally. That is\r\nthe standard which I desire to apply, but be sure the work of education\r\ncannot stop; one year is nothing in the history of a nation--one year\r\nat a time when we are at war, peaceful though that war may be, when\r\nwe are aspiring to the greatest, with the most powerful bureaucracy\r\nin the world--one year is nothing at all in point of time: and can\r\nanybody reasonably say that if you shun your books for that one year\r\nand take up this battle of Swaraj, you are not doing your duty? May I\r\nsuggest that those of you who want to continue your studies will not be\r\ndoing your duty in the battle of Swaraj? But those of you who are in\r\nthe second, act in a manner true to yourselves, but whatever you do,\r\nremember that it is a non-violent war (hear, hear) Remember that if you\r\ngo back to those colleges, after leaving them, you prove yourselves\r\ncowards and unworthy of being engaged in this great and glorious war.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, allow me, again, to thank you on behalf of my revered leader\r\nand my great friend Mr. Mahammad Ali (cries of \"Bande Mataram.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. C. R. Das, in moving the Non-co-operation resolution at the Indian\r\nNational Congress, Nagapur, 1920, said:--_\r\n\r\nI rise to move the resolution on Non-co-operation. I shall presently\r\nread the resolution before you; but before I do that, I ask you to\r\nconsider it very carefully, word by word, and line by line, because I\r\nmust emphatically deny the charge that the Non-co-operation resolution\r\nwhich was passed in the Subjects Committee, is weaker, and not\r\nstronger, than the resolution, which was passed in Calcutta. Let me\r\nfirst read this resolution. (Reads resolution). Gentlemen, let me put\r\nbefore you in a few words the scheme of it. We say that our wrongs,\r\nincluding the Khilafat, and the Punjab wrongs--I do not enumerate\r\nthe wrongs because they are so many--that each wrong, so far as I\r\nam concerned, is a cause of the attitude that I have taken up. We\r\ndeclare that our wrongs are of such a nature that we must attain Swaraj\r\nimmediately (hear, hear). Then, we declare that all other methods,\r\nwhich we have employed up to now, have failed and that, the only method\r\nwhich is left for us, is, the method of non-violent non-co-operation\r\n(hear, hear); and we declare that there must not be any mistake about\r\nit that this Congress has resolved definitely, clearly and without any\r\nambiguity, that the whole of this scheme of non-co-operation shall be\r\nput in force to secure our rights and to attain Swaraj; and we declare\r\nfurther that, in the meantime, those things which we resolved upon at\r\nCalcutta, are to continue but not only those things, we are to direct\r\nour activities in other directions as well. Here I pause for a moment\r\nto consider the question which, I regret, has been raised, namely,\r\nthat this resolution is weaker than the Calcutta resolution. May I ask\r\nyou to consider in what respect is it weaker? I claim it is stronger\r\nit is fuller, it is more complete. In the Calcutta resolution, there\r\nwas no clear declaration that this National Congress has resolved\r\nto put in force the entire scheme of non-co-operation down to the\r\nnon-payment of taxes although I believe with Mahatma Gandhi that that\r\nmay not be necessary. But still if that is necessary I want it to be\r\nclearly stated that the people of India will not shirk from putting\r\nthat into force. Then we say that, in the meantime, till that call\r\nis sounded--and you must remember, gentlemen, directly the call is\r\nsounded, that call has to be obeyed by all sections of the community,\r\nlawyers, students, trades-men, merchants, agriculturists, every body,\r\nevery section in the country must respond to that call (hear, hear)\r\nand do you understand what that means. That means that this tyrannical\r\nmachinery of the Government is regulated--is driven, not regulated--by\r\nwhom, not by the Bureaucracy but by the Indians; and it means that the\r\nmoment that call is sounded, every Indian is to take his hands off that\r\nmachinery (hear, hear) and compel this Government to do what you like.\r\nBut ours are not the hands which will move your machinery (hear, hear).\r\nThat is putting in force the entire scheme. Then, let us consider what\r\nwe have got to do in the meantime. The Calcutta resolution was confined\r\nto the students and lawyers and a general resolution about boycott of\r\nforeign goods. Here we say we keep the same injunction with regard to\r\nstudents but we differentiate between students under 16 and students\r\nabove 16. Then, with regard to lawyers, we keep not only the same\r\nthing, we re-affirm the Calcutta resolution, but we say that we are\r\nnot satisfied with the way in which that resolution has been responded\r\nto by lawyers; and we say that greater effort must be made to secure\r\nthat; and also we refer to the scheme of settlement of disputes by\r\nprivate arbitration. Then comes the economic question, and we say that\r\nthe economic drainage is one of the greatest wrongs from which we have\r\nsuffered: and we say that a Committee of experts must be appointed at\r\nonce to form and organise a plan of boycott of foreign goods. Then we\r\ncome to the other question. We come to the boycott of Councils. We say\r\nthat it has succeeded, and we say further what naturally follows from\r\nthat, namely, that the men who are at present occupying those seats\r\nare not representatives of the people of India (Hear, Hear). Not only\r\ndo we stop there, but we go further, that those people who pretend to\r\nrepresent them do not represent them, and therefore we call upon the\r\nvoters not to take any political assistance from those people. And then\r\nwe appeal generally, for unity in favour of the depressed classes, in\r\nfavour of every section of the community which require protection and\r\ndevelopment more than we do. This is the scheme of the resolution. In\r\nwhat respect is it weaker? In respect of lawyers? I say 'no,' because\r\nit re-affirms but it continues to call upon lawyers to act up to that\r\nresolution. Is it weaker in any point? From the point of view of\r\nstudents, I say 'no.' I have guarded against students coming out under\r\nfalse sentiment. I think that it is right, that this greatest national\r\nassembly in India should declare that those students who feel the call\r\nof duty and conscience should immediately come out, regardless of\r\nconsequence (Hear, hear). Is it weaker in respect of the boys under\r\n16 years? I say what is weakness, and what is strength? We make it\r\nstronger by making it more just and more practical. Is it weaker in\r\nrespect of the economic question? I do not admit that, because in the\r\ngeneral resolution which you had and which Mahatma Gandhi himself was\r\nto carry out, we have got a systematic plan of economic boycott and\r\na practical boycott--a boycott which will not only be spoken of but\r\nacted upon by every Indian worth the name. I ask again,--where lies\r\nthe weakness of such a resolution? It is nothing but the result of\r\nundue suspicion. I am making no appeal. I am making no personal appeal\r\nin my favour; but I do ask you to remember that when I say anything I\r\nmean it, and in my life on public questions I have never said anything\r\nwhich I do not believe in. Some of you may suspect, but all I can\r\nsay, brother, ask me any question and I will answer, ask me what I\r\nintend to do, I will answer. Beyond that I will not refer to personal\r\nquestions. I call upon you, in the name of all that is holy, to carry\r\nthis resolution without one single dissentient voice. I want you to\r\ndeclare it to the nation and to the bureaucracy, and to the nation to\r\nrealise their God-given rights. The rights exist, but rights have got\r\nto be realised. The rights exist because this is the eternal law of\r\nlife; but still every man and woman and every nation on earth has got\r\nto realise those rights. Realise the fact that we have got those rights\r\nand the moment you realise that the bureaucracy or any cracies in the\r\nworld cannot stand against you and I want you to tell the bureaucracy\r\nthat we have made up our minds to realise it, and we have made up our\r\nminds to compel you to recognise that which we have got. May God grant\r\nus strength not only to pass this resolution but to work upon this\r\nresolution and to carry out the great idea of which this resolution is\r\nthe expression (loud cheers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_A very largely attended meeting was held in Maulana Mazhar-ul-Haqu's\r\nCompound on Friday, the 11th February 1921 at Patna when Mr. C. R. Das\r\naddressed as follows:--_\r\n\r\nMy Friends, I must confess that it is somewhat difficult for me to\r\naddress you on a subject on which I have been talking for the last, I\r\ndon't know how many days. I am somewhat tired of making speeches. When\r\nI came to Bankipore I thought I would simply listen to speeches and\r\nthat I shall have no trouble to address you. But I was prevailed upon\r\nto address you. I have been reading several newspapers lately just\r\nto understand the criticism against the policy of Non-co-operation.\r\nI read speeches of public men and of Government, non-officials, and\r\nof Governors. So I thought it might be hardly necessary for you to\r\ndeal with those things but it might be useful to clear the grounds of\r\nprinciple and policy of the congress. I want to speak to you about the\r\nprinciple of Nationalism. We have heard the word Swaraj so much that we\r\nprobably do not realise its full meaning. The principle of Nationalism\r\nis also the principle of Swaraj. Swaraj is a convenient expression for\r\nadopting a cause which would be of Nationalism. Long before this policy\r\nof non-co-operation was started by Mahatma Gandhi, in fact in the year\r\n1917, I remember what I spoke from the Congress platform at Calcutta.\r\nYou remember in those days there was a great deal of controversy as to\r\nwhat would be the precise scheme of self-government. Bombay spoke the\r\none way and Bengal the other. There were many differences of opinion\r\nas to what scheme of self-government there should be. Then I said it\r\nis useless to discuss the policy; we want to govern our own country,\r\nnamely to govern ourselves and regulate our own conduct and develop the\r\nnation in the light of our own experiences. I say we want to realise\r\nthat cause of nationalism. The moment we realise that, the moment we\r\nrealise the right that God has given us, that moment the bureaucracy\r\nwill be crushed under feet. The criticism which has been levelled\r\nagainst the Congress is this, namely, that the Congress has not defined\r\nwhat Swaraj is. Many people at Calcutta have taken this objection. My\r\nanswer to that is very simple. The very nature of Swaraj is such that\r\nit is impossible to define it. Swaraj is that which you realise in your\r\nheart to-day. How can you then define what sort of Swaraj you will get.\r\nRealise your right, and the moment you realise that right, the moment\r\nwhat you realise will become fact. If you realise less right you will\r\nhave less fulfilment, if you realise in complete and absolute right,\r\nSwaraj you are bound to get. You cannot define it. India wants that\r\nand the moment India realises that whole heartedly, I say that moment\r\nSwaraj is ours. I care not whether you have Parliamentary councils,\r\nwhether legislative councils divided into so many compartments whether\r\nyou have upper house and lower houses in order to govern the country.\r\nI want India to say in one voice that we will govern ourselves. That\r\nis the right we have. No Government can deprive us of that right.\r\nThe moment you discover that, you will get Swaraj. Therefore, before\r\nyou think what kind of self-government we should have I want to tell\r\nyou that you should concentrate your mind, day in and day out over\r\nthe attainment of Swaraj. My justification for that is nationalism.\r\nDo you understand what nationalism is? Many people, very genuine and\r\nintelligent people say that they would not have nationalism because it\r\nis antagonistic to humanity. They forget that in this God's creation\r\nthere are various nations and that India to-day pleads for her own\r\nnationalism. Indian nationalism does not and cannot hurt humanity.\r\nI understand by humanity several races that are inhabitants of this\r\nearth, Indians, Europeans, Americans, Russians, and others that are\r\ninhabitants of the globe and if I am pleading for nationalism of India\r\nto-day how I am going against humanity and nationalism of the earth.\r\nIndia's nationalism is according to her own traditions and principle,\r\n\"Live and let live\" according to your right. We have no quarrel with\r\nyou but when you cut away our nationality and right, it is then we say\r\nthat we will not co-operate with you. You develop your nation in your\r\nown way. You, Americans, you develop your nationalism in your own way.\r\nBut if you say that Indian nationalism must be fashioned in your own\r\nway, killing our nationalism, that cannot be tolerated. Therefore you\r\nfind nationalism and Swaraj to be absolutely the same thing. Here I\r\ngive you an example. Take a garden. You see the beauty and glory of\r\nGod's creation all round the garden. But if a flower says to another\r\nflower that it should not grow in its own way, is that possible? I say\r\nthat so far as the law of hidden nature is concerned it should go in\r\nits own way. Each has got its own individuality, own nationality. This\r\nnation has got an absolutely distinct individuality. Is this nation to\r\nlive according to European ideals? Do you think that an Indian can live\r\naccording to English traditions? Indian nation must grow according to\r\nits own temperament in the light I have described. We have been trying\r\nto build our own nation for the last 35 years, but we have discovered\r\nto day that throughout the history of British rule every attempt made\r\nfor the development of nationality was crushed by the bureaucracy.\r\nWherever you strive for freedom there is every obstacle from the\r\nofficials. Therefore what happened in the Punjab became possible.\r\nThere was a Rowlat Act. It was to kill your nationalism and for that\r\nwhole of India protested. No Nationality can prosper which has got\r\na Government by bureaucracy of that character. Whatever you do they\r\nwill come and check you, and ruin that line for ever. Therefore it is\r\nthat the Congress has declared that every method which we had hitherto\r\napplied has failed. At the Amritsar Congress Mahatma Gandhi was for\r\nco-operation. I must confess I did not agree with that proposal. He is\r\na good-hearted gentleman.\r\n\r\nHe told me is it not better to follow faith while co-operation has\r\ngiven such large promises. He thought that bureaucracy would change\r\nits angle of vision. I said that we cannot do so. And few months\r\npassed that Mahatma Gandhi was convinced that I was right. Congress\r\nhas declared now, having regard to what happened in the Punjab, what\r\nhappened to our Mohamedan brethren, and the passings of many oppressive\r\nlaws from time to time. Congress has declared with one voice, and all\r\nprovinces have accepted this time unanimously that the only method\r\nwhich remains is that of non-co-operation. It has been explained\r\nover and over again. Many people have asked me about that. I found\r\nit easy to explain in Bengal. The other day I had to address a large\r\nassembly of labourers of a mill near Calcutta. I told them that you\r\nwork at mills, you have seen machinery, well, who is it that drives the\r\nmachinery. Who is it that makes the machinery work and produce articles\r\nand manufacture things. It is not that Burra Saheb who sits in a chair\r\nlording over the whole business. It is you who move the machinery.\r\nSo many bags of papers come out because you move the machinery. I\r\ntold them that the huge Government is nothing but a machinery. Who\r\ndrives that machinery? It is ourselves. It is the students who read\r\nin colleges, it is the pleaders who practice in courts, it is the\r\npolice officers, it is the Deputy Magistrates who decide cases, it is\r\nthe judges who administer laws. So in every way it is the Indian that\r\ndrives this machinery. A history of last 160 years shows explicitly\r\nthat your objects are not our objects. Our object is to foster our\r\ndevelopment, your object is to crush our manhood. Therefore there is a\r\ncomplete difference between the object of bureaucracy and ours. Think\r\nwhat happened in Punjab and I cannot forget Khilafat either. These\r\ninstances you cannot forget. You remember there was a non-official\r\ncommittee appointed by the Congress. Last year we all met at Benares\r\nand we signed the joint report as non-official commissioners. The\r\nreport was drafted by Mahatma Gandhi. We examined that report and we\r\ndiscussed the matter. We purposely put our demands very low. In fact we\r\nput it so low that some of our countrymen were very angry. They asked\r\nmuch more than that. And now I tell you, it is no more a secret. We had\r\nmade up our minds that we would put forward our demand and it ought to\r\nbe no more a pious resolution and we must insist upon the Government to\r\nact up to our recommendation. Our legitimate demands were so low. Even\r\nthese demands were treated with scorn and the offenders were left scot\r\nfree. Subscriptions were raised for those villans. Ladies danced, I am\r\ninformed, to collect money for the upkeep of those villanous offenders.\r\nWe entered into a contract there in the holy city of Benares. It is for\r\nthis blunder that Mahatma Gandhi has started this non-co-operation.\r\nHis object is that their hands are polluted, therefore, whatever\r\ntheir institution, no self respecting Indian can remain there. Every\r\nIndian should take his hands off from that Government. No Indian who\r\nhas got any self-respect should go forward to help this bureaucracy.\r\nMahatma Gandhi started it and after that my friend Mr. Moti Lall Nehru\r\njoined it. In Calcutta Congress I did not join it because there was\r\ngreat difference of opinion. Few read my speech because I was against\r\nnon-co-operation at Calcutta. It is not a fact that I opposed that\r\nresolution on the very ground of non-co-operation. Once I have made\r\nup my mind to accept it, I must follow up to it. Afterwards I made\r\nup my mind that this Non-Cooperation must be more complete from the\r\nnational point of view. I wanted to bring a more effective resolution.\r\nSo far as my practice is concerned I have not accepted a single new\r\ncase after the Calcutta Congress. I drafted another resolution. I\r\nspecially went to Benares and there discussed the resolution with\r\nMahatma Gandhi, with my friend Madan Mohan Malaviya, with my friend\r\nLall Lajpat Rai, I met again Mahatma Gandhi at Dacca and discussed\r\nwith him again and he agreed to it. Those who knew of the inner working\r\nof Nagpur Congress might have known how I worked from morning till\r\nnight for that resolution and I tell you I succeeded. It made clear\r\nthat Non-Co-operation is that everybody should take his hands away\r\nfrom the machinery of Government and that until the whole country is\r\nnot prepared for that we must go on stage by stage. That resolution is\r\nfully satisfactory. Mr. Jayakar of Bombay opposed it. He did not join\r\nus before. I do not know why. But I am glad to say that only the other\r\nday he declared that he has given up his practice as a lawyer and has\r\nbecome a non-co-operator. Therefore, every one who met at Benares and\r\ntook that vow in the holy city of Benares have become non-co-operators.\r\nI have arrived at the conclusion that this life is not worth living\r\nand I would rather much sooner die than lead a life of a slave in this\r\ncountry. This country is ours given by God. We have to realise that\r\nday and night. I say again that the moment you realise that right that\r\nvery moment Swaraj is ours. What is Swaraj? It is a right to carry\r\non your own right in your own way. There is another thing before I\r\nhave done. Mahatma Gandhiji's Charkha has caused much laughter before\r\nthe officials. People who are saying so are totally ignorant of our\r\nslavery. Our slavery is more economic than political.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was telling you something about Charkha, I have been asked in several\r\nplaces as to how Charkha could improve matters. How could Charkha\r\nbring Swaraj. Do you know what the facts are. Swaraj means that we\r\nmust live within ourselves. We must be self-contained. I tell you\r\nthat we are great slaves to-day. Our economic slavery is greater than\r\npolitical slavery. Exploitation is carried on by the bureaucracy.\r\nThe Non-officials and officials so far as Europeans are concerned\r\nconstitute the bureaucracy. One helps the other, so exploitation and\r\nadministration are the two chief policies of the Government. I say our\r\neconomic slavery is very great indeed and constitute the main factor\r\nof our dependence. The facts at present are that if Manchester and\r\nLancashire stop sending cloth our women will have to go naked. That was\r\nnot the case in India before this bureaucracy came here. Our system was\r\nnot this. I speak of Bengal because I claim to know more about Bengal.\r\nThe system obtained in India was, that so far as our necessaries were\r\nconcerned we were self-contained. We never depended on any body in\r\nIndia. We made our own clothes and were independent of any race in the\r\nworld. Now just consider what Charkha can do for you. From Manchester\r\ncomes 60 crores of rupees worth of cloth every year. You will not\r\nhave to pay these 60 crores of rupees which go out of India. If a\r\nhouseholder works by Charkha for one or two hours a day at the end of\r\nthe year he will find himself with all the necessaries of his family.\r\nFor a clerk who gets 40 or 50 rupees per month, and who weaves his own\r\ncloth every day, it is a great deal of saving for him. It is very easy.\r\nOne ordinary tree will yield one to 3 seers of cotton, and 1/4th of a\r\nseer is quite enough for one Dhoti. If you use Charkha only for limited\r\nhours daily you will get sufficient cloth for a Dhoti. This Dhoti that\r\nI am wearing to-day will last 4 times longer than that which comes from\r\nManchester. I tell you, you will solve it very easily. If the work\r\nis carried on all this year by every student and every householder,\r\nwe will see the economic independence of India to-day. Along with it\r\nyou will achieve your political independence. It is only for one year\r\nthat we are asking for Charkha and after that you can regulate your\r\nmethods. You do not want any mills. It is only for one year. Many ask,\r\nwhat about ship-building, what, about navy etc., I say for God's sake,\r\nI do not want any thing for one year. If you once secure economic\r\nindependence, I venture to say that India's economic development cannot\r\nbe prevented by any power in the world. It will grow better and better\r\nevery year. I know there is a great deal of discussion about it and\r\npersonally I can tell you that I cannot for one moment be in favour\r\nof European industrialism at all. I shall not at all be sorry if some\r\nof the things that are manufactured in England are not made here. Do\r\nwhat you should do, work a Charkha and you will realise the result. If\r\nyou do that you will without doubt get independence. Now, gentlemen,\r\none word more and I have done. I have told you that non-co-operation\r\nis the only method to achieve freedom. I have also told you that the\r\nwork of non-co-operation is very difficult. It will be destroyed if it\r\nis not kept by non-violent method. The whole work will be impeded if\r\nit is not carried on non-violently. Every kind of violence mental or\r\nphysical is detrimental to the method of non-co-operation. Therefore\r\nevery non-co-operator's work must be strictly non-violent. He has to\r\nface danger after danger. Every non-co-operator will be inculcated,\r\nbeaten, outraged but he should strictly maintain non-violence. You know\r\nthe ways and methods of bureaucracy in this country. They have got\r\nso many sections in their Penal Code which they can use against any\r\npreacher of non-co-operation. I do not for one moment, think that these\r\nmethods can ever root out non-co-operation. They know that the moment\r\nnon-co-operation succeeds that very moment bureaucracy will be crushed.\r\nI know they will try to destroy the method of non-co-operation by using\r\ntheir penal sections. They may go on using section after section. But a\r\nnon-co-operator should never indulge in violence.\r\n\r\nContinuing Mr. Das said that he knew that proceedings have been started\r\nagainst certain workers in the district of Muzaffurpur under sections\r\n107 and 144 of the C. P. C for delivering violent speeches. They should\r\nnot give any excuse like that to the bureaucracy. But now that they\r\nhave been served with the notices they must comply with the section.\r\nLet the action of the bureaucracy be as autocratic, as autocratic can\r\nbe. Let them break the law, and not the non-co-operators. If they\r\nfound that the authorities were using section after section unjustly\r\nwithout any justification then the congress would have to declare civil\r\ndisobedience. Time would then arrive to break the law. But that moment\r\nhad not arrived yet. Their mission was the mission of law-abiding\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIf violence is used you will go against the Indian National Congress\r\nand destroy this sacred method. You must know in your heart of hearts\r\nthe secret of Swaraj and that you will gain only by Non-co-operation.\r\nThe only feeling, the only intense desire which a Non-co-operator\r\nshould cherish, his only prayer to God, should be for the achievement\r\nof Swaraj. Gentlemen, now I am tired. I wish our movement a success in\r\nthe province of Bihar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in punctuation and spelling are as in the original.",
