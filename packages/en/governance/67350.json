Curiously, however, they have quite neglected one of the\r\nmost promising of all the approaches to this study--the government of\r\ncounties. It is in the belief that a discussion of this subject would\r\ntend to throw a great new light upon the “democratic experiment” that\r\nthe author has prepared this volume.\r\n\r\nThis is not a hand-book or a treatise on counties. Such a work cannot\r\nbe successfully carried through without a much wider and more thorough\r\nresearch into the subject than has as yet been attempted. The author\r\nhopes that this present work will do something to suggest and stimulate\r\nsuch research. In the meantime the outlines of a very real and very\r\nimportant “county problem” are visible and they mark the scope of this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThe reader will doubtless note the complete absence of any\r\ndiscussion of the county in its relation to the educational system.\r\nThe explanation of this omission lies in the great difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing anything like a universal interest of the county in\r\nthis branch of public administration, apart from those of the state\r\ngovernment and of the smaller divisions, except in the levying of taxes\r\nand the distribution of tax money.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Richard S. Childs, Secretary of The Short Ballot Organization,\r\nthe author is indebted for the suggestion that the book should be\r\nwritten, and for criticisms of the manuscript. Assistance of the most\r\nhelpful sort during the manuscript stage was also rendered by Mr.\r\nHerbert R. Sands, of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, and by\r\nMr. Otho G. Cartwright, of the Westchester County Research Bureau.\r\n\r\nInasmuch also as it has not seemed advisable to encumber the text with\r\nan excessive number of footnotes, the author wishes to acknowledge\r\nparticularly his debt to Prof. John A. Fairlie’s volume, _The\r\nGovernment of Counties, Towns, and Villages_, which was the source\r\nof much of the historical material, and to Mr. Earl W. Crecraft, whose\r\nstudies of Hudson County, N. J., have been drawn upon at considerable\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n  H. S.

Four hundred American cities,\r\nwithout regret and with little ceremony, have cast aside the tradition\r\nthat complexity is the price of liberty. They have started afresh upon\r\nthe principle that government is public business to be administered as\r\nsimply, as directly, as openly and as cheaply as the law will allow.\r\nInasmuch as their former governments were not adapted to that ideal,\r\nthey have hastened to make them over. Contrary to prediction, the\r\npalladium of liberty has not fallen. Business goes on as usual, public\r\nbusiness in a way that is amazingly satisfactory, as compared with the\r\n“good old” days.\r\n\r\nWhere will the movement stop? Have all the secret passages been closed?\r\nHave all the dark alleys of local politics been lighted? Or does work\r\nfor explorers lie ahead?\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the constitutional convention then in session at Albany, was\r\nsurveying the foundations of the political structure of New York,\r\nundertaking to make adjustments to the sweeping changes that had\r\ncome over the life of the state in the previous twenty-year period.\r\nCommittees were chosen to rake the far corners of the system for\r\nneeded adjustment. Hundreds of experts were summoned and hundreds of\r\ncitizens voluntarily appeared to press their views and their wants.\r\nThe committee having in charge the organization of the _state_\r\ngovernment listened to an ex-president, the heads of two leading\r\nuniversities, prominent efficiency experts and every important state\r\nofficer. The committee on _cities_ gave audience to the mayor\r\nand chief legal officers of every important city in the state, while\r\nthe conference of mayors was sufficiently interested to send one of\r\nits number to stump the state for an amendment which would promote\r\nthe welfare of New York cities. The work of these divisions of the\r\nconvention was of deepest concern to the state. It received from the\r\npress and the public no small amount of interested comment.\r\n\r\nThere was also a committee which touched on an interest that includes\r\nevery inhabitant--county government. One might have imagined that this\r\nbody too could have attracted at least one or two celebrities. There\r\nare sixty-one counties in New York State. Everybody lives in one. They\r\nsafeguard property, personal and civil rights. But not so. Two or three\r\npublic hearings; no ex-presidents; no college heads; no considerable\r\nnumber of interested private citizens--such was the tangible display of\r\nawakening to the subject at hand.\r\n\r\nAt a singularly appropriate moment, however, a brand-new association\r\nof clerks of the boards of supervisors was formed. Several members\r\nof the body appeared in person before the convention. The committee\r\nappealed to them to enrich its fund of information concerning the home\r\ngovernment. They were given a free rein to tell of the needs of their\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nIn view of collateral facts, the testimony of this notable group of\r\npublic servants is peculiarly illuminating. The representative of a\r\ncentral New York county was there and blandly did he announce that his\r\npeople were perfectly satisfied with their county government; they\r\nwould not dream of modifying it. The clerk from a Hudson River county\r\nwas equally optimistic, and went to some pains to show in detail just\r\nhow very well his county was governed. Similar testimony was presented\r\nfrom a county in the capital district. Then up spoke the clerk from\r\nnear the borders of Pennsylvania: the people of this neighboring\r\nstate had conceived so great an admiration for the form of his county\r\ngovernment that they were longing to substitute it for their own rather\r\nsimpler system.\r\n\r\nNow for the collateral facts. Not more than two months following this\r\nhearing, officers of the National Committee on Prison Labor got word\r\nof misdoings at the jail in the central New York county and succeeded\r\nin securing a Grand Jury investigation. The details of their findings\r\nscarcely lend themselves to print. Enough to say that the sheriff’s\r\ndeputies had made a practice of allowing both men and women prisoners\r\nto come and go at will and permitted most disreputable conditions to\r\nprevail in the prison. Shortly after the committee hearings the state\r\ncomptroller completed his investigation of the financial affairs of\r\nthe Hudson River county. His report reeks with accounts of flagrant\r\nand intentional violations of the laws on the part of not one but\r\nnearly all of the county officers. As for the clerk from the capital\r\ndistrict, he was confronted at the hearing itself with several pieces\r\nof special legislation passed, at the instance of the sheriff and the\r\nsuperintendent of the poor, for the increase of salaries of deputies\r\nover the head of the local governing body. That this appeal was not\r\nso much in the interests of the county as of “political expediency”\r\nand at the expense of the taxpayers, he cheerfully admitted. But as\r\nfor the near-Pennsylvania county, that was the earthly home of a man\r\nwho had conceived a clever method of breaking into the county treasury\r\nby having the board of supervisors create for his benefit, contrary\r\nto law, the position of “county custodian.” Once firmly settled in\r\nhis new position he persuaded the board to turn over to him (quite\r\nillegally) their responsibility for auditing the claims against the\r\ncounty, and persuaded the county treasurer to cash any warrant that\r\nmight have his “O. K.” When he had made away, in this manner, with some\r\nninety thousand dollars, the comptroller discovered his misdoings. Of\r\nthe whole bad mess, the solution which the “custodian” selected was\r\nsuicide. But the government of that county had not been fundamentally\r\nchanged to meet the defects of organization revealed in these\r\ndisclosures.\r\n\r\nA collection of isolated facts? Familiar American graft and\r\ninefficiency? Perhaps. But in the cities and in the states the public\r\nhas been going after such things. In the counties of New York the\r\npeople apparently did not know that such conditions were present. The\r\nclerks who appeared at Albany and were, for the most part, the sole\r\nrepresentatives of their several counties, seem to have told the truth,\r\nat least about the people’s complacency, but they might have been\r\nmore accurate and more complimentary if they had labeled it “lack of\r\nknowledge.”\r\n\r\nFrom coast to coast a deep silence broods over county affairs. Can\r\nit be that, while cities have been reveling in franchise scandals\r\nand police have been going into partnership with vice interests,\r\nwhile state legislatures have been lightly voting away public money\r\non useless political jobs and extravagant public institutions, the\r\ncounty alone is free from every breath of scandal and is a model of\r\nofficial uprightness? Scores of municipal leagues and city clubs\r\nand bureaus of municipal research are delving into city affairs and\r\nfinding opportunities for betterment at every turn of the hand.\r\nBut the number of county organizations that are doing critical and\r\nconstructive work could be numbered on the ten fingers, or less. Many\r\nof the colleges offer courses specifically on municipal government,\r\nbut the “one pervasive unit of local government throughout the United\r\nStates” is disposed of with a brief mention. No political scientist\r\nhas ever had the ambition to plow into the soil, so that while there\r\nis now available a five-hundred-page bibliography of city government,\r\nthere has never been written a single volume[1] devoted exclusively to\r\ncounties. Journalists for the most part have left the subject severely\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in those few instances where the county has been put under the\r\nmicroscope or has been given more than a passing thought, the reward\r\nof the investigators’ labors have always been so certain and rich as\r\nto excite wonder as to how much further the shortcomings of the county\r\nextend. In Hudson County, N. J., a few years ago, the cost of the court\r\nhouse which had been fixed at nine hundred thousand dollars, threatened\r\nto run up to seven million dollars. Impressed by this striking\r\ncircumstance, a body of citizens formed themselves into a permanent\r\nFederation to look deeper and longer into this back alley of their\r\ncivic life. They found that the court house incident was but the most\r\ndramatic of a hundred falls from grace. The Public Efficiency Society\r\nof Cook County, Ill., the Westchester County Research Bureau, the\r\nTaxpayers’ Association of Suffolk County, the Nassau County Association\r\nin New York and the Tax Association of Alameda County in California\r\nhave all been richly repaid for their investments in county government\r\nresearch. Sporadic cases? Possibly. And then again perhaps there is\r\nsomething basically defective in the system.\r\n\r\nBut is it all a matter of importance?\r\n\r\nIf universality and magnitude of cost count for anything, yes. Nearly\r\nall the inhabitants of the United States live in a county and nearly\r\nevery voter takes part in the affairs of one. There are over three\r\nthousand such units. In their corporate capacity they had in 1913 a\r\nnet indebtedness of $371,528,268 (per capita, $4.33), which was a\r\ngrowth from $196,564,619 in 1902 (per capita, $2.80). In that year they\r\nspent for general government, $385,181,760, which is something like\r\none third the cost of the federal government for the same period. Of\r\nthis amount, $102,334,964 was for general management. Through these\r\ncounty governments the American people spent for highway purposes,\r\n$55,514,891; for the protection of life and property, $15,213,229; for\r\nthe conservation of health, $2,815,466; for education, $57,682,193;\r\nfor libraries, $364,712; for recreation, $419,556 (mostly in the\r\nsingle state of New Jersey); for public service enterprises, $189,122;\r\nfor interest charges, $17,417,593; upon structures of a more or less\r\npermanent nature, $89,839,726.\r\n\r\nThe figures, though of course not to be taken too seriously, are in\r\nsome cases as impressive for their paucity as in others for their\r\nmagnitude, for throughout a large part of the United States the county\r\nis the sole agency of local government.\r\n\r\nCounties pretty much throughout the nation are the corner-stone of the\r\nsystem of partisan government and organization.\r\n\r\nCounties, for this variety of reasons, therefore, would seem to be a\r\nfit subject for scrutiny as to their relation to some of the vital\r\nissues of American life.\r\n\r\n[1] _Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social\r\nScience_, May, 1913, contains a number of important monographs on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJUST WHAT IS A COUNTY?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore our forefathers had “brought forth upon this continent a new\r\nnation,” there was no universal standard relationship in the colonies\r\nbetween the local and the general colonial or state governments. In\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the towns had begun as\r\nseparate units; then they federated and gradually developed an organic\r\nunity; that is, the localities produced the general government. In the\r\nSouth, on the other hand, the local governments had more the semblance\r\nof creatures of the general government designed to meet the expansion\r\nof the earliest settlements into wide and therefore less wieldy units\r\nfor administration.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the constitution of 1789, it became possible to\r\nstandardize the division of labor of governing the continent. In\r\nthe center of the scheme were placed the states, which reserved to\r\nthemselves all the governmental power there was, except what the\r\nconstitution specifically conferred upon the federal government.\r\nHenceforth, whatever may have been its historical origin or its\r\nancient traditions, every local division of government was to content\r\nitself with such functions as were to be portioned out to it by\r\nsuperior state authority. It was to have no “inherent” powers. It was\r\nto act simply as an agency of the state, which had power at will to\r\nenlarge or diminish the local sphere of activity or wipe it off the map\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nNow the duties which state governments assumed in the early years\r\nof the republic were as simple as necessity would allow. This was\r\npreeminently the day of “as little government as possible.” The people\r\nof the states covenanted with themselves, as it were, to stand guard\r\nover life, liberty and property. It was a broad enough program, but it\r\nwas the custom in those days to interpret it narrowly--no humanitarian\r\nactivities beyond the crude attempts to deal with the more obvious\r\nphases of poverty; no measure of correction in the modern sense; no\r\n“public works.” As an incident in meeting these obligations, the\r\nconstitutional convention and the state legislatures met and laid\r\ndown statutes or codes of conduct affecting these elementary needs\r\nof a civilized people. They defined the various crimes (or adopted\r\nthe definitions of the English common law); they legalized a civil\r\nprocedure. It was definitely settled that the voice of the whole people\r\nshould control in determining _what_ the state should do for its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThen came the question of getting the means for applying these\r\nabstract principles to daily life, of bringing to every man’s own\r\ndoor the means for enforcing his rights. Had the American people\r\nproceeded from this point along logical lines they would have cut the\r\nadministrative machinery to fit their state-wide policies. But it was\r\nnot so ordered. The officers of the _state_ had determined upon\r\nthe policies; the officers of the _localities_ were to execute the\r\npolicies. The period of the American Revolution, with its deep-seated\r\ndistrust of kingly power, was the beginning of an era of decentralized\r\nadministration which gained rather than diminished in force for as\r\nmuch as two generations. For the purpose, the existing counties served\r\nas instruments ready to hand and their status now became fixed as the\r\nlocal agencies of the state government. New counties were formed from\r\ntime to time as needs arose. In each of these counties was a loose, but\r\nmore or less complete organization, which it will now be fitting to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nMore important perhaps than any other enforcing agent of the county, in\r\nthese still primitive days, was the sheriff, who sooner or later became\r\na fixture in every American colony. This most ancient officer of the\r\ncounty had been perpetuated through the centuries from Saxon and Norman\r\ntimes. He had inherited nearly all of the powers and prerogatives\r\nof his historical prototype as they obtained in England during the\r\nseventeenth century. He did not preside over a court in the county,\r\nbut he could make arrests for violation of the law, with or without a\r\nwarrant. If his task was too much for one man, he could summon to his\r\naid a _posse comitatus_ of private citizens. And inasmuch as he\r\nwas obliged not only to apprehend, but to hold his prisoner for trial,\r\nit very naturally fell to him to take care of the lock-up or jail.\r\n\r\nThere had been established, beginning with Connecticut, in 1666, a\r\nsystem of local courts, whose jurisdiction in most states came to\r\nbe co-extensive with the county. Around this institution centered\r\nthe official life of the county, so much so that the county capitol\r\nis universally known as the “court house.” The sheriff from its\r\nbeginnings acted as the high servant of this court, in the disposition\r\nof prisoners, the execution of judgments, the service of warrants of\r\narrest and in similar duties.\r\n\r\nTo the account of Connecticut is also to be credited the most unique,\r\nand in many ways most important county officer of modern times. In\r\nthe development of its criminal law, England had never worked out\r\na system of local prosecuting officers. The colonies in the early\r\ndays had assigned the duty of representing the state’s interest to\r\nthe magistrates. But in 1704 there was authorized for each county\r\nin Connecticut an attorney “to prosecute all criminal offenders ...\r\nand suppress vice and immorality.” From this beginning came the\r\ndistinctively American officer who is variously known as district\r\nattorney, prosecutor of the pleas, solicitor, or state’s attorney.\r\n\r\nSince the business of the county court (which formerly included\r\nadministrative as well as judicial matters) was too important not to\r\nbe recorded, there was established a clerk of court whose duties are\r\nsummarized in his title. In more recent times, however, the functions\r\nof this officer have been both expanded and limited, according to\r\nthe amount of the transactions in the county. So that, in the larger\r\ncounties each court, or sometimes a group of courts, have a clerk\r\nwhose duties are solely concerned with judicial matters, while in less\r\nimportant counties the “county clerk” finds it easily possible to serve\r\nin no less than a dozen different capacities. It is the county clerk\r\nwho ordinarily issues marriage licenses and receives for filing, real\r\nestate deeds, mortgages and a variety of other papers.\r\n\r\nAnd then, without apparent good reason, the colonists had brought\r\nover from England the coroner. In the days of Alfred the Great this\r\nofficer had had an honorable and useful place in the realm. As a sort\r\nof understudy of the sheriff, he took the latter’s place when he was\r\ndisabled. Meanwhile he was the King’s local representative, charged\r\nwith the duty of laying hands on everything that seemed to be without\r\nan owner and taking possession of it in the name of the King. But\r\nthrough the lapse of time, the “Crowner” had lost both dignity and\r\nduties until there was little left except for him to take charge of\r\nthe bodies of those who had died by violence or in a suspicious manner,\r\nseek the cause of death and locate, if possible, the person responsible\r\nfor the circumstance.\r\n\r\nSo much for the organization to administer local justice, which is the\r\nirreducible minimum of county government. In early colonial times (and\r\neven yet in certain states), the judges and other judicial officers had\r\nperformed important duties outside this limited field of administering\r\njustice. But in time the processes involved in the payment of salaries\r\nand the up-keep of a county building, created in sizable counties a\r\n“business” problem of no mean proportions. Since in most states these\r\ncosts have been charged against the county, it has been necessary to\r\ninstall appropriate machinery of fiscal administration. In every county\r\na board of directors, variously selected and denominated, has taken\r\nover the management of material things. With the help of a variety of\r\nminor administrative officers like the assessors, the treasurer and\r\nother fiscal officers, it raises and appropriates money; it audits\r\nclaims against the county; it borrows money.\r\n\r\nAround this judicial and administrative nucleus was built the universal\r\nAmerican county. In the rural sections it expanded to meet the lack of\r\nany other local government. As an incident to the theory that the state\r\nis responsible for at least a minimum of protection of human life, the\r\nstate government had taken upon itself the care of indigents. This duty\r\nit usually turned over directly to the county. The county authorities\r\nhave also had control (often exclusively so) of rural roads and bridges.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of these various functions the American people seem\r\nto have thought it quite unnecessary for the county to be supplied\r\nwith the proper apparatus for doing its own policy making. Or, to look\r\nat the matter from the other side, they deemed it quite appropriate\r\nthat the policy-making part of the state government, which is the\r\nlegislature, should not control the hands and feet, which in matters of\r\nlocal concern consist of the county officials. Elaborate general laws\r\nwere enacted to prescribe in minute detail the daily round of routine\r\nof each officer. Why should he or why should the people think? It was\r\nnot the purpose of the state that they should. And without thinking,\r\nthere could be no differences of opinion; without differences of\r\nopinion, no “issues”; without issues, no real politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA CREATURE OF TRADITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all came about in this way:\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in the permanent Virginia colony found a climate\r\nthat was mild and a soil that was fertile. Numerous rivers radiating\r\nthrough the country furnished a natural means for transportation.\r\nIndians were not a serious menace. The settlers themselves were of the\r\nlanded gentry, closely identified with the established English Church.\r\n\r\nOut of such a combination a very definite polity inevitably grew. The\r\npeople were destined to spread themselves far and wide; agriculture was\r\nto be their chief pursuit; little government would be needed and the\r\nforms and substance of democracy would have at best a slow growth.\r\n\r\nFor many years the local government consisted primarily of small groups\r\nof settlements which were called hundreds or parishes and were presided\r\nover by a vestry of “selected men.” When the plantations were large and\r\nscattered, government was sometimes supplied by the owners themselves.\r\nBut in 1634 in Virginia, the example of English institutions took\r\nfirmer root and eight shires or counties were formed and made the\r\nunit of representation in the colonial assembly and for purposes of\r\nmilitary, judicial, highway and fiscal administration. The officers\r\nwere the county lieutenant (the militia officer), the sheriff (who\r\nacted as collector and treasurer), justices of the peace and coroners.\r\nAll were appointed by the governor of the colony on the recommendation\r\nof the justices, and the latter thus became a self-perpetuating body of\r\naristocratic planters controlling the county administration. This body\r\nof appointed justices constituted the county court, which to this day\r\nin some of the southern states is not only a judicial body, but also\r\ncorresponds to the board of supervisors or the county commissioners in\r\nother localities.\r\n\r\nSuch was one line of descent. The Virginians, like most of their\r\ncontemporaries, knew little and cared less for political science.\r\nThey simply turned to their English experience, pieced together some\r\nold-country institutions and adapted them to the new world. Their\r\nexperiment succeeded for the time being at least. It could scarcely\r\nhave failed under such simple conditions.\r\n\r\nOf quite a different sort were the influences at work in New England. A\r\nsevere climate, a rocky soil and menacing Indians drove the colonists\r\ninto compact communities, where they could live by shipping and\r\nfishing. They too were fortunate in striking an environment that\r\nrather exactly fitted their old-country experience. For they were\r\na homogeneous, single-minded body of people with firm traditions of\r\ndemocracy and a common religious faith. From the congregational form\r\nof organization that was characteristic of the Puritan movement to\r\nthe town meeting for purposes of civil government, was a single easy\r\nstep. Thus the “town” idea came to hold the center of the stage in New\r\nEngland local affairs. But it never had the all-sufficiency in its\r\nsphere which the county had in the South, and even New England had to\r\nrecognize a need for more comprehensive subdivisions. And so, in 1636,\r\nMassachusetts was divided into four judicial districts in each of which\r\na quarterly court was held. In 1643 four counties were definitely\r\norganized, both as judicial and militia districts, and before the\r\nmiddle of the century there was established a system of representative\r\ncommissioners from each town, who met at the shire town to equalize\r\nassessments. The office of county treasurer was created in 1654. Later\r\na militia officer was appointed, and within a few years county officers\r\nwere entrusted with the duty of registering land titles, recording\r\ndeeds and probating wills--functions transferred in part from town\r\nofficers and in part from the governor and council.\r\n\r\nSo from Virginia and Massachusetts flowed the two streams of\r\ninstitutional influence, the former tending to make the county the\r\nexclusive organ of local government, and the other emphasizing the\r\ntown. Maryland, though it had started out with a somewhat special type\r\nof organization borrowed from the County Palatine of Durham, with its\r\nmanors and hundreds, later came under the sway of Virginian precedents\r\nand three counties were established there in 1650. The Carolinas, which\r\nwere not thoroughly organized until the eighteenth century, followed\r\nthe Virginia plan in its main outlines. Georgia’s development was not\r\nwell begun until after the Revolution. Connecticut, Rhode Island, New\r\nHampshire and Maine all followed the lead of Massachusetts, though the\r\nfirst two of these states minimized the importance of the county to an\r\neven greater extent.\r\n\r\nTo these two lines of influence the central states added the idea of a\r\ndistinct administrative authority, which was composed in New York of a\r\nnew body made up of the supervisors of the towns, in New Jersey of the\r\nlocal assessors and in Pennsylvania of special commissioners. These\r\nnew departures were established in the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In all of these states, it should be noted, the township also\r\nexisted for a limited number of purposes, such as the care of the poor,\r\nfor election, administration and for purposes of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe westward movement of population had begun before the Revolution.\r\nFollowing in general the parallels of latitude of their native\r\nsoil, the pioneers carried their local institutions with them for\r\ntransplantation, regardless of the wholly different underlying\r\nconditions that now confronted them. In their closely populated,\r\nhomogeneous settlements the New England pioneers that crossed over into\r\nthe Western Reserve had been accustomed to act through town meetings.\r\nNothing would do now but a reincarnation of the old institutions. The\r\nsix-mile rectangles into which the surveyors had divided the western\r\nterritory gave them their opening. There was accordingly developed in\r\nthe open prairie among the isolated homesteads a unit of government\r\nthat at least superficially resembled the old New England town. It was\r\nbut a geometrical expression, to be sure, but the mere shadow of it\r\nseems to have given satisfaction. But in 1802, when the state of Ohio\r\nwas carved out of this territory, this exotic growth was cut short\r\nand the “county-township” system of Pennsylvania was adopted. Indiana\r\nfollowed Ohio in this step and the system came to predominate in the\r\nMiddle West, as for example, in Iowa, Kansas and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe instinct for harking back to precedents appeared also in the\r\nearly history of Michigan. When it was organized as a territory it\r\nwas divided up into counties. But in 1825, under the stimulus of\r\nimmigration from New York where the township-supervisor plan was in\r\nvogue, townships had to be established for particular purposes to meet\r\nthe prevailing demand for this type of self-government.\r\n\r\nIn the South, Kentucky and Tennessee took their cues from Virginia\r\nand established the justices in control of the county administrative\r\naffairs. Mississippi and Alabama took Georgia for their model.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana, the parish authority corresponding to the board of\r\nsupervisors or commissioners is the police jury, which is elected by\r\nwards very much on the principle of the New England town.\r\n\r\nIn the country beyond the Northwest Territory, the clash of New England\r\nand southern influences was met by an interesting compromise. In\r\nIllinois, for instance, the earliest settlement had been made under\r\nsouthern auspices. The county type of local government was therefore\r\nestablished, but of the style employed in Ohio and Indiana rather\r\nthan in Kentucky. In 1826, however, the justices were made elective\r\nby precincts and later the township was made a corporation for the\r\npurposes of school, road, justice and poor relief administration. By\r\n1848 the “town idea” had grown strong enough to force the adoption of a\r\nprovision in the new constitution for a plan to afford each county an\r\noption between the two systems. The northern counties quickly adopted\r\nthe township plan, while the southern ones clung to the original\r\nforms. Wisconsin at an even earlier date (1841) had effected a similar\r\ncompromise which, however, was swept away seven years later when the\r\ntownship system was made mandatory by the constitution. At a later\r\nperiod Missouri (1879), Nebraska (1883), Minnesota (1878) and Dakota\r\n(1883) permitted the adoption of similar optional laws.\r\n\r\nIn the new Southwest, the Northwest, the Rocky Mountain region and the\r\nfar West, owing in part to the comparative sparsity of settlement and\r\nin part to the thinning out of the definite historical influences, the\r\ncounty has acquired a greater importance than anywhere in the country\r\nand the towns or townships, while they have been erected in a number of\r\nthe states, play but an insignificant part in local government. When\r\nTexas became an independent republic, the American county system was\r\nsubstituted for the earlier Mexican local government. Before the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century counties had been established in New Mexico,\r\nUtah and Oregon; ten years later in Nebraska and Washington; by 1870 in\r\nColorado, Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the institution of the county has been driven westward in\r\nobedience to precedent and through the instinct for imitation. Of\r\nthoughtful foresight, of definite planning for a serviceable career,\r\nabout the same measure was applied as in the case of Topsy, who “jest\r\ngrowed.” It could not be otherwise. Local government in pioneer days\r\nhad to be thrown together more or less on the “hurry-up” plan. On\r\nthe western prairies as in colonial Virginia, public needs were so\r\nlimited that it really mattered comparatively little what agencies were\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nCounties once established acquired a tendency to “stick” tenaciously to\r\nnearly their original form. Even in the seventeenth century the county\r\nin England was well into a decline. Its disintegration had begun with\r\nthe growth of populous centers, that demanded more government, both in\r\nquantity and in variety. The seven Saxon kingdoms whence counties grew,\r\nhad ceased to be either natural or convenient self-governing units.\r\nIn a later period they have ceased to be even important subdivisions\r\nfor the central administrative departments, and they have been crossed\r\nand recrossed by the lines of sanitary and other districts until the\r\noriginal county may be said to be scarcely distinguishable.\r\n\r\nIn America even sharper and more pervasive social forces have been\r\nassaulting this ancient institution. In our thinking of the Industrial\r\nRevolution it has been customary to dwell upon its effects in urban\r\ndistricts. This movement made the modern _city_. But its effect\r\ndid not stop there. Modern mechanical devices have also made the\r\noriginal county boundary lines obsolete. Steam railway lines have\r\nbrought into close communication points which were once too distant\r\nto be traversed easily and often, under all sorts of conditions.\r\nElectric railways, in many instances have supplemented the process.\r\nThe automobile, particularly of the cheapest type, has brought within\r\neasy reach of the court house points which a hundred years ago, when\r\nthe stage-coach was the standard of locomotion, were too remote for\r\nfrequent communication. And, finally, the extension of mail facilities\r\nand the telephone have minimized the importance of face-to-face\r\nbusiness intercourse beyond anything ever dreamed of when counties were\r\nfirst made.\r\n\r\nCounties as we see them on the map often fail to take account of the\r\nsweeping changes in the character of populations. On the western\r\nprairies they were formed for a sparsely distributed people following\r\nchiefly agriculture. In the midst of these regions at numerous points\r\nhave sprung up great centers of manufacture and commerce like Chicago,\r\nKansas City, St. Paul, and Omaha. In their train have followed the\r\nmultifarious problems of the modern city, which require a very\r\nparticular sort of governmental treatment.\r\n\r\nTo these conditions the county as an institution has consistently\r\nmaintained an attitude of stolid indifference. Division of old counties\r\ngoes on from year to year. (Bronx county separated from New York in\r\n1914, to the accompaniment of a costly new court house and several\r\nhundred new jobs and no benefit to the taxpayers and citizens except\r\na heavy increase in taxation.) But who can recall two counties that\r\nhave consolidated? Such an exhibition of modernity and of the spirit\r\nof progressivism it is apparently not in the nature of the county to\r\nafford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFALLING AFOUL OF “DEMOCRACY”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet we should do the subject less than justice were we not to\r\nrecall an historical adventure that befell the county in the period\r\nof its coming of age, when it was assuming something like its typical\r\nAmerican form.\r\n\r\nIt was about the time of the Revolution when the atmosphere was\r\nparticularly uncomfortable for “tyrants” and for every created thing\r\nthat could be given the semblance of “tyranny.”\r\n\r\n“The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of\r\nrepeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the\r\nestablishment of an absolute tyranny over those States.” So ran the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and if it was not a precise statement of\r\nfact, it was at least an accurate gauge of the fighting public opinion\r\nthat was making political institutions. King George’s “frightfulness”\r\nseems to have been chiefly and most concretely brought into the public\r\neye in the colonies by the acts of “swarms of officers” that had been\r\nsent over “to harass our people and eat out their substance.”\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the British Empire, it was a stiffening up\r\nof the colonial administration to make effective the Navigation Acts,\r\nthe Stamp Acts, and similar measures. But it had come too late. Through\r\na century and a half the spirit of independence had grown firmer and\r\nfirmer and the colonists’ sense of identity with the British Empire\r\nhad sensibly diminished. So that when the imperial revenue collectors\r\nbegan to “swarm” on their shores, the colonists were goaded into a\r\nsmashing antimonarchical mood. It was no mere temporary fit of rage,\r\nand when physical violence of the Revolution was over, the intellectual\r\nupheaval steadily gathered new force through the influence of men of\r\nthe Jefferson school. One of the feats to which the statesmen of the\r\nRevolution devoted themselves was devising means for preventing future\r\n“swarms” and the “tyranny” they brought with them.\r\n\r\nWhat irritated them more than all else was the fact that these imperial\r\nagents were not colonially selected and controlled. But now the people\r\nhad replaced the king. _They_ would now select the officers. A\r\nhappy thought! But how to work it out; that was the question.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to pick flaws in their handicraft, but it should be\r\nborne in mind that the architects of the nineteenth century American\r\ndemocracy were working in the dark without models or precedents and\r\nwithout established principles of organization. It is easy now to look\r\nback and say: “You carried your ‘democracy’ too far. It would have\r\nbeen not only enough, but infinitely more effective to have let the\r\npeople select simply the legislative or ‘policy-determining’ officers\r\nand subordinated the administration to them. The thing to do was to\r\ncontrol the _source_ of power. If you had been careful to separate\r\n‘politics’ from ‘administration’ you would have saved our generation a\r\nwhole world of political woe.”\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that the then existing institutions had come into\r\nbeing as a patchwork development to meet successive new needs. As for\r\nlocal government, there was so little of it and it ministered to such\r\nelementary wants that very few serious questions of policy ever rose\r\nwithin its jurisdiction. Moreover, the officers who came in time to\r\nhave regulative or semi-legislative functions, seem to have been from\r\nthe beginning, concerned with the details rather than the policies of\r\ngovernment. This was true of the justices of the peace in Virginia, the\r\nselectmen in the New England town, the supervisors in New York, and the\r\nassessors in New Jersey. There was no choice except between selecting\r\nand controlling (or trying to control) administrative officers and\r\nforegoing any part whatever in local affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not to be understood that no local officers were\r\nelected before the Revolution. Massachusetts had always had its town\r\n“selectmen” and even as early as 1854 each county elected its treasurer\r\nand, beginning at a somewhat later date, the county lieutenants.\r\nSupervisors were created as elective officers in New York in 1691, but\r\nthey were executive and representative officers from the very start.\r\nAnd the same may be said of the town assessors in New Jersey (1693)\r\nand the county assessors in Pennsylvania. But the real precedent for\r\n“electing everybody” was set in Pennsylvania in 1703 when the sheriffs\r\nwere first chosen by the people--a step which was followed in 1726 by\r\nthe establishment of elective county commissioners.\r\n\r\nBut immediately after the Revolution the new notions of democracy began\r\nto work more aggressively. Virginia now organized counties and its\r\nconstitution stipulated that officers not otherwise provided for should\r\nbe elected by the people. Sheriffs and coroners were made elective\r\nunder the New Jersey constitution and New York took away the governor’s\r\npower of appointment and vested it in a council of appointment,\r\nwhich was composed of the governor and four senators chosen by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThere were cross-currents in this movement, however, and both in the\r\nNorthwest (under the ordinance of 1787) and in Kentucky and Tennessee,\r\ncounty officers established in the closing years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury were made appointive, in the one case by the governor and in\r\nthe other by the county judges. But in the new constitutions of Ohio\r\n(1802), Indiana (1816), and Illinois (1818), the elective principle\r\nworked without a hitch. Mississippi, Alabama, and Missouri followed.\r\nBy 1821 the passion had seized New York State, and sheriffs and county\r\nclerks were thereafter elected by the voters of the counties.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia at the constitutional convention in 1829-30, local\r\ngovernment was the subject of an acrimonious discussion, with the\r\nJeffersonian influences seeking to break down the established power of\r\nthe self-perpetuating justices, who were charged with inefficiency, and\r\nestablish in their place the New England town system. But Madison and\r\nMarshall, who were both members of the convention, successfully upheld\r\nthe existing order. By the middle of the century both Virginia and\r\nKentucky succumbed to the democratic influence and there was a complete\r\nreaction from the appointive system. New York extended the elective\r\nidea to district attorneys and county judges, and Massachusetts and New\r\nHampshire in due time made similar alterations.\r\n\r\nIn the states west of the Mississippi the tendency to put all the\r\ncounty officers in the elective class was assumed from the start to be\r\nthe only method of insuring popular control.\r\n\r\n“The rule of the people” at last captured the whole country, except\r\nRhode Island, where even the sheriff is still appointive.[2] The\r\nmovement was at its height during the long period of democratic\r\ncontrol from Jackson to Buchanan, and it had behind it the powerfully\r\nstimulating spirit of the new West. It was the conception of\r\npractical, direct, but superficial thinkers and politicians. To be\r\nsure, the particular appointive system in use in New York and other\r\neastern states under the earlier constitutions had behaved badly. The\r\nJacksonians leaped headlong at the conclusion that the trouble lay in\r\nthe idea of appointment _per se_. Other alternatives they did not\r\nfor a moment consider, but with an air of supreme finality declared\r\nthat “the people must rule”--by electing as many officials as could be\r\ncrowded on the ballot.\r\n\r\nThe fact also that the county possessed no satisfactory appointing\r\npower left no other course but to let the people undertake the\r\nintricate work of an executive. So that through the passing of the\r\nyears that single course has materially multiplied the number of\r\nelective officers--the people themselves, enamored with the dogma that\r\n“the cure for democracy is more democracy” looked on complacently while\r\ncomplication has been heaped upon complication.\r\n\r\nIn the almost unique opportunity for a simplified government which\r\nhas been presented to the people of any county, they have strenuously\r\nand successfully resisted the change. Such an instance happened a few\r\nyears ago in the county of San Bernardino, California. The people had\r\nalready adopted a county charter in which the powers of the county were\r\nvested in a single small board of elective officers somewhat on the\r\ncommission plan now in use in many American cities. It was regarded\r\nby many as the highest type of modernized county organization adopted\r\nup to that time anywhere in the United States. But in the interval\r\nthat elapsed between the adoption of the charter and its going into\r\neffect, someone discovered (or thought they discovered) that the people\r\nwere about to be deprived of their ancient liberties and that a local\r\noligarchy was about to be erected. Soon petitions were in circulation\r\nand this perfectly good charter, which had been adopted but never tried\r\nout in practice, was amended so as to nullify the very principle of\r\norganization which pointed to greater simplicity and a better fixing of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century popular government has been galloping down the\r\nhighway that leads to governmental confusion. Nowhere does the record\r\nstate that because the people elected long strings of officers, the\r\npeople therefore _controlled_ those officers. All the while the\r\nservices which government could render have become more and more\r\nnumerous and the public needs of the people more pressing. And all the\r\nwhile too, the filling and holding of office for office sake has been\r\nvested with exaggerated importance, so that the county more perhaps\r\nthan any other civil division has been the home of fictitious political\r\n“issues.” At regularly recurring intervals the nation-wide county\r\nsystem has been shaken to its foundations over the private futures\r\nof their local Tom Joneses and Tom Smiths. One of these respective\r\ngentlemen must leave his growing law practice and sacrifice his time\r\nto his county by serving papers for the county judge or prosecuting\r\ncriminals before the Grand Jury. And none but the people is competent\r\nto judge which of the two it shall be.\r\n\r\nIs the district attorneyship to be filled? Then, properly speaking,\r\nthere would seem to be nothing to do but to search for the highest\r\ntechnical ability in sight and place it above the influences of any\r\nconsideration but that of preserving the civil rights of the whole\r\npeople. It is a simple criterion, around which no “issue” could\r\nproperly arise. But popular government has regularly and almost\r\nuniversally thrown the selection of the public prosecutor over into\r\nthe political arena, where tests of fitness for specific duties count\r\nnot half so much as a good campaign speech or the ability to swing a\r\ntownship into the Republican or Democratic column.\r\n\r\nIn the same way many sheriffs might have set before them the plain duty\r\nto obey the rigid prescriptions of the statutes. But American democracy\r\nhas all but universally decreed that sheriffs shall be selected after\r\nthe manner of discretionary, policy-determining officers. As for the\r\ncoroner, who would suppose that his grim services could be made the\r\nsubject of interested, intelligent popular discussion? But the coroner,\r\nin a majority of states, is on the “ticket,” a subject ostensibly\r\nfor the citizens to weigh in the balance with a view to the fittest\r\nselection. And then the ballot nearly always bears the candidates\r\nfor the office of county clerk. He, like the sheriff, has his duties\r\nminutely described in the laws, to the dotting of an “i” and the\r\ncrossing of a “t.” But in the estimation of many good citizens it is\r\nof supreme importance that a good Republican or a deserving Democrat\r\nshould be placed in the office, in order, presumably, that the office\r\nforms may be arranged for the filing cases according to the historical\r\ndoctrines of one or the other of the national parties.\r\n\r\nNever was there a serious movement to elect United States marshals or\r\ndistrict attorneys. Other and more satisfactory methods of selection\r\nhave been employed. But for the analogous officers in the states,\r\nnothing but popular choice would satisfy the temper of the young\r\nAmerican republic.\r\n\r\n[2] By the legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE “JUNGLE”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long “bed-quilt” ballot of county officers, as a Chicago\r\nnewspaperman called it, at first innocently, and then maliciously,\r\ndeceived, misled and disfranchised the “average citizen.” As to the\r\nmanner in which this result was brought about, more hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut aside from all that, the long ballot principle turned out to\r\nbe the father of irresponsible organization. Each elective officer\r\nreceived his commission straight from the people; his accountability\r\nwas solely and directly to them. No officer was to be entrusted with\r\nmuch power for the fear that he might emulate King George and enslave\r\nthe county. Government generally was regarded as a natural but more or\r\nless necessary enemy of the people to be tied with a short rope lest it\r\nbreak loose and do incalculable damage.\r\n\r\nTo the devotees of this theory, the idea that the county should have\r\na directing executive head, if indeed it ever received consideration,\r\nwas apparently too suggestive of Hanoverian monarchy to be seriously\r\nentertained. This was to be a “government of laws, not of men”--the\r\npeople would see that all went well.\r\n\r\nIt was such a spirit, no doubt, that guided the development of\r\nthe county system in an eastern state, which the writer studied a\r\nfew years ago. In the course of this effort the interrelations of\r\nofficers in a typical unit were diagrammed--with the result shown in\r\nfrontispiece. It was found, for instance, that the county clerk who\r\nwas “directly responsible to the people” was given duties to perform\r\nunder some twenty different laws, the enforcement of which under the\r\nconstitution was charged upon the governor as the chief executive of\r\nthe state. In fulfillment of these obligations he was found to be\r\nunder the direction, among others, of the superintendent of banking,\r\nthe superintendent of insurance, the commissioner of excise and the\r\nsecretary of state. For the routine of his office he was answerable\r\nto the local board of supervisors. The sheriff, who “took his orders\r\nfrom the people,” was found to be answerable to the supervisors, the\r\nsurrogate and the county judge. The district attorney was put down as\r\nsubject to at least three minor state officers besides the governor\r\nand the board of supervisors. The county treasurer looked up (or was\r\nsupposed to) to the state commissioner of excise, the state board of\r\ntax commissioners, the commissioner of education, the comptroller and\r\nthe state treasurer.\r\n\r\nAnd in all this wilderness of conflicting responsibility there was, be\r\nit reiterated, no single officer who could be called the executive.\r\nThe governor, it is true, had power to remove and fill vacancies, but\r\neven this negative control was conditioned by the fact that there\r\nwere sixty-one counties in the state, that some of them were hundreds\r\nof miles from the capital and that the governor was charged with a\r\nthousand other responsibilities besides looking after the counties. It\r\nwas true that the state comptroller was given power to examine into\r\nthe fiscal affairs of the various counties, but this safeguard was of\r\nlimited value in practice, owing to the small number of examiners which\r\nthe legislature provides.\r\n\r\nNo, the ingenious Anglo-Saxon mind had discovered a substitute for\r\nefficient personal supervision! If a given officer were to go wrong or\r\nneglect his duties, then the supervisors were authorized to go to the\r\ndistrict attorney and persuade him, if possible, to take action on the\r\nofficer’s bond or to institute a criminal prosecution. If the district\r\nattorney was negligent in the matter, the supervisors might go to the\r\ngovernor with charges of neglect of duty. But if the original officer\r\nin question was just lazy, slow or inefficient, then everybody simply\r\ncould wait “till he got round” to doing his duty.\r\n\r\nTo this day this circumambulation in the name of democracy actually\r\nfulfills the conception of popular rule for no inconsiderable body\r\nof political leaders. Where the system goes wrong, they inject a\r\nlittle more confusion, a little more irresponsibility into the plan\r\nof government. Take, for instance, the Indiana system. In 1898 the\r\ncounty government became the subject of a state-wide scandal and was\r\nmade the political issue of the year. The governor in his biennial\r\nmessage followed the good old American custom: more complications, more\r\ndivision of responsibility. He recommended a system of “safeguards”\r\nwhich had the effect of taking away power (and responsibility) from\r\nthe county board (commissioners) and vesting it in a brand-new body\r\nknown as the council, composed of seven members, three elected from the\r\ncounty at large, and one from each of the four councilmanic districts.\r\nThis council was made the tax-levying and money-appropriating body\r\nfor the county and no money could henceforth be drawn from the county\r\ntreasury except upon their appropriation. It also was given the\r\nsole authority to issue bonds and borrow money. And so the county\r\ngovernments in Indiana were blocked at just one more point and the\r\ncounty commissioners were made just one shade less accountable than\r\nthey were before the enactment of this ingenious piece of “reform”\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nTwo of the New England states developed equally clever methods of\r\nbreaking down financial responsibility. New Hampshire, with its boards\r\nof commissioners elected by the people of the counties would seem to be\r\nwell-equipped with fiscal agencies. But not so! The commissioners may\r\nonly recommend appropriations for county expenses--and a “convention,”\r\nconsisting of the members of the House of Representatives of the\r\nvarious towns then allows, or disallows, them. Such an institution was\r\ncreated many years ago. Connecticut goes New Hampshire one better by\r\nconstituting the convention of the local members of _both_ houses\r\nof the legislature. The convention may not only vote the amount of the\r\ngeneral county appropriation, but the appropriation for any specific\r\nitems of county expenditures for the two fiscal years following, or for\r\nthe repairs and alterations of county buildings.\r\n\r\nDemocracy via complication was applied also in the state of New Jersey,\r\nwhen the legislature of 1898 took from the board of chosen freeholders\r\n(supervisors) of Hudson County the control over the Hudson County\r\nBoulevard. An act passed in that year created a separate new commission\r\nof three members to be elected by the people, upon which was conferred\r\npowers comparable to those of a separate municipality. The commission\r\nwas even given the right to maintain a separate police force, to own\r\nand operate a separate electric lighting plant, to employ its own\r\ncleaning and repairing force and to act in other ways entirely separate\r\nfrom the county road and highway system and independent of the street\r\ndepartments of those municipalities through which the road lies. This\r\nindependent body was authorized to fix its own appropriations and\r\nmake them mandatory upon the board of chosen freeholders, to let all\r\ncontracts for the construction of the roads under its charge and to\r\nemploy a separate engineer.\r\n\r\nWhen Hudson County began to lay out its park system, the disintegration\r\nof the county system was carried a step further. Another wing was added\r\nto the amorphous county structure, a Park Commission to be composed\r\nof four members. These were not to be elected like the Boulevard\r\ncommissioners, or appointed by an executive, as is done in most cities,\r\nor chosen by the board of chosen freeholders, but appointed by the\r\nJudge of the Court of Common Pleas! This commission also became a\r\nseparate corporation, like the Boulevard Commission, and now has power\r\nto requisition appropriations on the board of chosen freeholders.\r\n\r\nBut the end of the tale is not yet. In 1912, Hudson County undertook\r\nthe extermination of mosquitoes. Another independent board! More\r\nindependent mandatory powers of appropriation! And the appointment\r\nof six members in this instance was vested in the Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court. Add to this layout a board of elections, appointed by\r\nthe governor, on the nomination of the chairmen of the two leading\r\npolitical parties, and you have the county jungle in all its primeval\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nThe people of New Jersey were thoroughly consistent in 1900 when\r\ntheir legislature broke with precedent and undertook to supply their\r\ncounties of the first class with some sort of a head by creating\r\nthe office of county supervisor. The governing boards of these\r\ncounties were at that time composed of representatives from various\r\nmunicipalities. So it was decided, in order to give the whole people a\r\nvoice in the government, to have the new officer elected at large. The\r\nlegislature had no notion of giving anyone any new power. They proposed\r\nto further subdivide existing power. True, the law under which this new\r\noffice was created, designates the supervisor as the chief executive.\r\nBut, as has so often been the case in city charters, this designation\r\nproved to be only a fiction. The law gave the supervisor the right to\r\nremove subordinates, but no instrumentality with which to investigate\r\nthe conduct of hundreds of county officers and employees and thus to\r\nmake his authority effective. Moreover, he was crippled by the fact\r\nthat the board of freeholders might reverse his decisions and reinstate\r\nthe officers or employees suspended. But what is of more importance,\r\nthe supervisor was given no power of original appointment.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Cook County, Ill., acquired a president of the board of\r\ncounty commissioners, who is elected by the people. Kings County, N. Y.,\r\nbefore consolidation with New York City, had a supervisor-at-large.\r\nBut neither of these dignitaries has or had any powers of appointment\r\ncomparable to, let us say, those of the mayor of Cleveland or of New\r\nYork. In the general run of counties, the executive is not a single\r\nofficer but the governing board itself. Where the “town plan” is in\r\nvogue, as in certain Illinois counties, and throughout New York State,\r\nthis body may be very large and unwieldy and is wholly incapable of\r\nsupervising administrative detail, except through small committees,\r\nwith the added division of responsibility which that implies.\r\n\r\nAnd so, county government everywhere was conceived in a spirit of\r\nnegation. The people elect their boards of supervisors or county\r\ncommissioners, hoping thereby to keep their fingers on the public purse\r\nthrough direct agents. The supervisors, in their turn, undertake to\r\nregulate the finances of the sheriff, the district attorney, the county\r\nclerk and the rest. But, lo, these officers are no subordinates of\r\ntheirs; they are the people’s humble servants. The supervisors may set\r\nout upon a program of economy and efficiency, including, let us say,\r\nthe standardization of supplies. But the county clerk may not recognize\r\ntheir superior authority, preferring to run his office, to suit his\r\npersonal convenience; and if the supervisors undertake to check him he\r\nmay find some way of appealing to the people. The superintendent of the\r\npoor, the treasurer and the auditor may likewise go their respective\r\npaces in defiance of all superior authority. If in the course of their\r\nofficial routine these officers collect sundry fees, they may account\r\nfor them or not, as they please, so far as the governing body is\r\nconcerned. They may be reached by some slow process of litigation, but\r\nnever in the direct summary way that is employed in private business.\r\nIt is a fatally ineffectual procedure. And when a dozen or nineteen\r\nofficers, chosen by popular election, are thrown together, it is\r\nclear that every one of them is the legal peer of every other, since\r\neveryone acknowledges a common superior. And since the people are a\r\nrather too unwieldy body to look after the details of county business,\r\neach officer must be a law unto himself. And it is perhaps just as\r\nwell that none of them has been designated as an official chief, since\r\nthe _facts_ of organization would refute and nullify any such\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIt is as though a board of directors were charged with the control of\r\na private enterprise, but were expressly denied the power to select\r\nthe manager and heads of departments to whom they might delegate their\r\nauthority over details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA BASE OF POLITICAL SUPPLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of its democratic adventures the county was incapacitated\r\nfor standing on its own feet. When every independent elective officer\r\nbecame a law to himself, the county ceased to be a single government.\r\nPolitically it became then little more than a convenient way of\r\nspeaking of a group of officers whose field of activity was closely\r\nrelated. In these very close relations lay the material for serious\r\nconflicts of interest that brought friction, delays, inaction. County\r\ngovernments could really get nowhere. Their energies were consumed in\r\nstanding still and keeping alive. Since separate officers of the county\r\nhad no common superior, the county could not move in any particular\r\ndirection; no more than an army of self-directing divisions, each with\r\na will of its own.\r\n\r\nMoreover there came to be counties which could not even organize\r\nthemselves, even after the imperfect fashion described in the laws of\r\nthe state. The people grew in numbers, their interests increased in\r\ncomplexity and county affairs sank into comparative insignificance.\r\nIn their theory of pure democracy via the ballot, they spread out\r\ntheir interest in county officers so thin that no single officer got\r\nsufficient attention to make him realize their influence. County\r\ncandidates were mixed up on the ballot with a multitude of others,\r\nstate, national and municipal, so that it was practically certain\r\nthat not only unknown but often undesirable citizens would step into\r\npower with the “people’s” stamp of approval. The voters of New York\r\nhave been electing coroners (or have been thinking they did). When\r\na few people in 1914 began to delve into the history of the office,\r\nthey turned up an astonishing situation. Scarcely one of the men who\r\nhad been elected to the office in a period of twelve years could be\r\nsaid to have had even a modest part of the qualifications required for\r\nthe positions. Some of the worst rascals of all had been elected in\r\nreform administrations and as one coroner admitted on the stand, the\r\ncontrolling purpose in mind in the selection was that of “balancing the\r\nticket” so that geographical sections and racial and religious elements\r\nwould get their proper share in the spoils.\r\n\r\nRural electorates probably have done better all along the line with\r\ntheir county officers than the voters in the cities. Measured by the\r\nstandards of personal acquaintanceship, the candidates for county\r\noffice have perhaps nearly always been known quantities in the rural\r\ndistricts. The “glad-hander” and the accomplished back-slapper has\r\ngotten on famously. They have made a business of knowing everybody. And\r\nyet they have sometimes, as private individuals, failed to reveal to\r\ntheir most intimate friends the qualities which have made them unfit\r\nfor a public trust. Placed in offices of conspicuous responsibility\r\nwhere the sunlight of public opinion and criticism has beat upon them,\r\nit is impossible that many men would have gone far wrong. But since\r\nthe work of county officers has had little to do with the shaping of\r\npublic policies upon which the average voter has any opinion; since the\r\ncounty jail has not been a public museum where men were wont to take\r\ntheir friends and families, and since there has been nothing especially\r\ninteresting about the serving of a warrant of arrest or attachment, the\r\nofficers involved have not always revealed their innermost personal\r\nqualities. Year after year a smiling popular sheriff might go on doing\r\nthese services in the most expensive, inefficient way, with here and\r\nthere a touch of corruption; and the great body of voters who met him\r\nevery week at the lodge would be none the wiser. In the same way the\r\nvoters might elect a “good fellow” superintendent of the poor. They\r\nmight continue to know him as a good fellow but it has been a rare\r\nconstituency that has followed him up in his official duties to know\r\nhow “good” he was to the unfortunates under his care and to the public\r\nin general. It has been a rare good fellow who has combined in his\r\nsingle person the ability to shake every right hand and kiss every\r\nbaby in the county, with a really modern, scientific knowledge of the\r\ntreatment of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe county clerk upon assuming office shuts himself away in a forest\r\nof filing cases and meets the public officially only as they come to\r\nhim for a marriage license or to file a deed or mortgage. And as for\r\nthe coroner, mostly people have been glad to leave him severely alone,\r\ntrusting that no untoward mishap will bring them into his clutches.\r\nFor all ordinary purposes they have regarded him as a grim joke, not\r\nknowing that in many cases a misstep on his part might result in the\r\nescape of a criminal or spoil the case of a litigant entitled to\r\ndamages or of a policyholder to his insurance.\r\n\r\nA possible exception to this inconspicuousness is the district\r\nattorney. American communities appear to have reserved high political\r\nhonors to the most efficient and best advertised “man-hunter.” A white\r\nlight of public interest has always beat upon the public prosecutor.\r\nMany a reputation for skill and courage and all-around general\r\nadministrative ability has been built up around a record of convictions\r\nof notorious criminals. The district attorney with a sense of the\r\ndramatic has usually been in line for the governorship of his state. It\r\nseems also to be regarded as conducive to efficiency that this officer\r\nshould be controlled directly through the ballot.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the system of popular election has given no assurance that,\r\nthough the people may know them ever so well as individuals, they\r\nwould know their candidates in the sense that fixes their electoral\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhat has had to be done, but what the people of the county have been\r\nunwilling or unable to do for themselves, has given to a public-minded\r\nfraction of the community the opportunity of their lives. They have\r\ngenerously taken over the people’s government and run it for them.\r\n\r\nGradually there has come to life a new profession, a governing class,\r\nwith leadership, discipline and resources. To the acknowledged head\r\nof this fraternity have come aspirants to public honors and seekers\r\nafter favors. Power and influence have been laid at his feet. He has\r\nbecome the virtual dictator of the county’s political destinies. The\r\nlaws underlying the organization of the county government have not been\r\nchanged; but there has grown up, quite outside the statute books and\r\noutside the court house itself, a second government that has supplied\r\nthe great lack in the official, legal one, the lack of a definite head.\r\nThe new factor in the county’s affairs has come to exercise the powers\r\nof an executive. _Theoretically_ the people have elected his heads\r\nof departments; practically he has chosen them himself. The people have\r\nretained the forms while he has arrogated to himself the substance of\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\nHe is with us yet, this clever, dominating, often silent personage,\r\nsometimes in a single individual, sometimes in a group, sometimes\r\nbenevolent, respectable and public-spirited, sometimes brutal and\r\nmercenary. It may not always be easy to find him, but he is _always\r\npresent in every American county_; for there is no stable government\r\nwithout him.\r\n\r\nFor the development of his peculiar talents the county is a\r\nparticularly favorable environment. For the county, in a word, is in\r\nthe shadow--the ideal condition for complete irresponsibility, which is\r\nthe father of bossism.\r\n\r\nBut what do the voters do if they do not in fact elect their officers?\r\n\r\nIt is now perfectly well known to students of political science that\r\nwhat the usual run of voter does in such a case is to ratify one or\r\nthe other set of candidates who have been previously culled over by\r\nthe county committee of either party. It is true that, under the\r\ndirect primary system, independent voters may start a revolt if the\r\npoliticians do something that is particularly “bold” and “raw.” But\r\neven that privilege is of questionable value, for it breaks down even\r\nthe kind of responsibility that obtains under the rule of an unofficial\r\nexecutive, since the boss, if criticized for a bad selection, is\r\nalways able to fall back upon the explanation that “the people did it\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nAnd when the votes have been counted and the candidates chosen, what\r\nof the citizens and the politicians then? Armed with a certificate of\r\nelection “direct from the people,” the sheriff, the coroner, the county\r\nclerk, owe no _legal_ allegiance to anyone save to them. But the\r\npeople have finished watching the election count and have gone home and\r\nback to work on concerns which are infinitely more absorbing than any\r\nwhich affects the county government.\r\n\r\nThen there comes into play another political allegiance which is not\r\nof law. The “governing class,” which gave the separate county officers\r\ntheir jobs, is not in business for its health. It does not put men\r\nin paid positions out of pure bigness of heart. It performs a public\r\nservice and it earns a right to collect a toll. _And it collects!_\r\nThe bosses collect “theirs” not only in terms of power to name the\r\nofficers whom the people shall elect, but insofar as no bothersome\r\ncivil service law is in the way they select also the subordinates. And\r\nthrough this power of appointment they exercise various other powers\r\nwhich make them to all intents and purposes the real seat of final\r\nauthority in the county.\r\n\r\nAnd so we see the workings of a natural law. In nature the organism\r\nthat survives is that naturally selected one that adapts itself to\r\nits environment. Just so the American democracy has adapted itself\r\nto the difficult political situation which it has itself created.\r\nThe political unit, which in the present instance is the county, is\r\nlegally without a head; forthwith instead of going to pieces, it grows\r\nthis necessary piece of anatomy outside its own body, and lo, an\r\naltogether unworkable system is made tolerably workable!\r\n\r\nOne reason why the boss flourishes so bountifully in the county is\r\nthe almost complete lack of any special legal qualifications for\r\nfilling the offices (except the district attorneyship). Anybody can be\r\na county clerk. He need only appoint as his chief deputy a faithful\r\neasy-going person who has been on the job for years at a stretch and\r\nhas made himself indispensable as a master of the details of the\r\noffice. This deputy will, of course, be the real county clerk and he\r\nwill draw a comparatively modest salary because he is of no direct use\r\nto the “organization,” while the elected official collects the high\r\ncompensation, spends a little time in the office every day, dividing\r\nthe rest between the interests of the “ring” and his own legitimate\r\nprivate business, which goes right on as usual throughout his term.\r\n\r\nAnother attraction in the county offices is the large fees which are\r\npaid in probably the majority of counties in lieu of stated salaries.\r\nThe county clerk collects from the person immediately benefited, a sum\r\nfixed by statute for each document filed. The sheriff makes similar\r\ncollections for the service of each legal process. The coroner draws\r\nfrom the county a fixed amount for each inquest.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the fee system is, first, that the service is paid for\r\nby the party whom it most concerns and secondly, that a specific reward\r\nfor a specific service will be an incentive to the officer to do his\r\nduty. Nearly everywhere, however, the theory has worked out very badly.\r\nIt is doubtless proper that every person who receives special service\r\nshould contribute accordingly to the expense of government. In small\r\ncounties where the work of the county is limited there seems also to be\r\nmuch to be said in favor of the officer keeping the fees. But in large\r\ncounties having an enormous business the compensation from this source\r\nis often all out of proportion to the amount of service rendered. It\r\nwould seem, for instance, that the sheriff of New York County, who is\r\nnever a man of special training, would be amply compensated for his\r\nroutine services by a salary of $12,000. But in addition to this sum\r\nhe is now (1916) receiving annually about $60,000 in fees. The county\r\ntreasurer of Cook County, Ill., within very recent years, is said\r\nto have pocketed during his four-year term about the better part of\r\n$500,000,--he was never willing to tell the public just what the amount\r\nwas and the law has protected his policy of silence.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that these rich prizes remain the personal\r\nproperty of an individual officer. Nor is it to be supposed that the\r\nnumerous deputyships which often provide berths at a much higher\r\ncompensation than would be allowed for the same service under private\r\nauspices, go to enrich the head of the office. No, the man or the\r\nmen, who put the sheriff or the county treasurer where they are have a\r\ngreat deal to say about the disposition of this money. In New Jersey,\r\nlest a single county officer should take himself too seriously in this\r\nrespect, the law provides that all appointments of the sheriff shall be\r\nconfirmed by the board of freeholders--and confirmation means control.\r\nIf the Cook County treasurer had kept the fees of his office, it is\r\nhardly to be supposed that the county commissioners for years would\r\nhave bitterly fought to prevent an accounting for these funds.\r\n\r\nThe county is indeed a wonderfully bountiful base of supplies for the\r\nspoilsmen. The circumstance goes far to explain the slow growth of\r\nthe merit system in this branch of government. Civil service laws are\r\nin force to-day in eighteen counties in New York, four in New Jersey,\r\none in Colorado, one in Illinois, two in California and the more\r\nimportant counties in Ohio. That is the extent of the merit system in\r\ncounties. Even in states like Massachusetts, Illinois and Wisconsin,\r\nwhere state-wide civil service laws affecting cities are in operation,\r\nappointments in the county offices are filled on the principle of\r\n“to the victor belong the spoils.” In New York State the courts have\r\nenunciated a principle with reference to the relation between the\r\nsheriff and his deputies which has the effect of fortifying the system\r\nagainst attack and its most prolific outlet. For, said the court in\r\nFlaherty _vs._ Milliken,[3] “the relation between a sheriff and\r\nhis appointees is not merely that the sheriff is responsible for the\r\ndefault of his appointee, but that the appointee for said default\r\nis _liable to the sheriff and to no one else_.” “The practical\r\noperation of this rule of personal agency,” says the New York Civil\r\nService Commission, “is in large measure to open the door for political\r\npurposes of persons in whom no real trust is reposed. These offices are\r\nin practice found to be a haven for political spoilsmen....”\r\n\r\nBut “spoils” often connotes something besides jobs that pay salaries\r\nor fees. In Westchester County, N. Y., where county affairs are known\r\nto the public rather more intimately than elsewhere (owing to the\r\nactivities of the local Research Bureau), it has been found that\r\nperhaps the richest patronage of all is in the county advertising. The\r\nstate of New York requires, for instance, the publication in every\r\ncounty of the complete session laws of the legislature, in two papers.\r\nIt means the setting up in newspaper type of two or more large legal\r\nvolumes of intricate matter that no one could possibly use in that\r\nform. Then there are multitudinous formal legal notices that issue from\r\nthe various offices at the court house, that rarely, in the nature of\r\nthe case, interest more than the two or three parties who may never see\r\nthem at all. Every paper that prints this material gets paid, often at\r\na much higher rate than it would be compensated for ordinary commercial\r\nwork. In one case an honest printer in Westchester County was so\r\nindiscreet and independent as to submit to the Board of Supervisors\r\na bill at something approximating a fair rate,--$600. His rivals\r\nremonstrated and undertook to get him to raise his figure--they were\r\ncharging $1060 for the same matter. But the independent said: “No, $600\r\nis the legal price and moreover it is good pay.” The board audited his\r\nclaim and of course cut down the rival papers accordingly,--but never\r\nthereafter did the county printing go to the man who wanted to be fair\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nPapers that go in for public advertising could not in many cases exist\r\nwithout it. Indeed many papers are created for the purpose of absorbing\r\nthis business. Their circulation is usually limited to a few hundred\r\ncopies. They cannot afford to criticize the administration in power or\r\nto express themselves independently on any public issue. Where there\r\nare several such organs in a county (Westchester has about twenty) the\r\nnewspaper field tends to be closed effectively against the type of\r\nlegitimate journal which would exercise a wholesome influence on public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nJust to what extent and how intensely this stifling influence exists\r\nthroughout the country is one of the really dark secrets of the county\r\nproblem. It shows its head in so many widely separated places and\r\nthere are so many feeble “boiler-plate” weekly papers that carry county\r\nadvertising, that one is led to suspect that it is a very pervasive\r\nfactor, especially in rural politics.\r\n\r\nThe importance of county spoils is not merely local. Throughout the\r\nnorthern states, except in New England, the county is undoubtedly the\r\nstrongest link in the whole nation-wide system of party organization.\r\nParty politicians hoot when reformers suggest that local politics\r\nhas nothing to do with the tariff or the Mexican question. And they\r\nare right! Whether properly or improperly, it has _very much_\r\nto do with these questions, or rather with the selection of the men\r\nwho handle them. The power, for instance, of Tammany Hall in national\r\npolitics is measured by its power to swing the most populous county in\r\nwhat is usually a pivotal state. Its power in the county is in direct\r\nratio to the number of offices with which it may reward party service.\r\n\r\nParty organization for a great part of the country has the county\r\ncommittee as its basis. This is especially true of the Republican\r\nParty in Pennsylvania where the present organization dates back prior\r\nto the Civil War. The state committee is chosen from districts based\r\nupon counties and the state machine is an assembling of all the local\r\ncogs and wheels. Politicians think and talk in terms of counties\r\nin their party councils and in the legislature. State machines are\r\nprincipally an assemblage of county units. In many states legislative\r\nrepresentatives are chosen from county districts.\r\n\r\nTrace the political record of the members of Congress. An astonishing\r\nproportion have come up either through county offices or through state\r\nlegislative positions filled by general county tickets. To that extent\r\nthe national legislature is the fruit of the county system. And is it\r\nnot safe to say, with the selection of certain Congressmen in mind,\r\nthat the stream of national politics is poisoned at the source?\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that machine politicians have come to look upon the\r\ncounty as a source whence blessings flow. The county has both created\r\nand sustained them!\r\n\r\n[3] New Jersey courts have rendered a diametrically opposite opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nURBAN COUNTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county has been put to its severest test in modern urban\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century began the\r\naway-from-the-farm movement. The discovery of steam power and its\r\napplication to every department of industry began to draw men,\r\nwomen and children from their homes to earn a livelihood in the\r\nnew industrial order. It became necessary for them to congregate\r\nin factories; they could no longer spread themselves out over the\r\ncountryside. Out of the factory system came the city, came hundreds of\r\ncities along the coasts and rivers and even on the open prairies. New\r\nmethods of transportation accelerated the process. The movement has\r\nnever stopped; not even yet, when more than a third of the country’s\r\ninhabitants are living in cities of twenty-five thousand inhabitants\r\nand more. Out of the growth of cities came congestion of population;\r\nout of congestion, problems of very existence without number.\r\n\r\nThe colonial heritage of local government was wholly unadapted to\r\nany such emergency. In simple pioneer communities it was easy to\r\nprovide government that met the unexacting standards of the times.\r\nEfficient government was not a live issue. Government, good or bad,\r\nwas little needed and there was little of it. And if that little was\r\nill-conceived, what matter?\r\n\r\nBut the time came when local government began to feel the strain of new\r\nresponsibilities. Cities failed miserably--“conspicuously.” Counties\r\nfailed even more miserably but without observation. It was not so much\r\nthat local government was called upon to perform more services, but\r\nthat it was to adapt itself to new conditions of service, to execute\r\nold forms of service in a more intensive fashion. For instance, in\r\na general way, the state had charged the county with the protection\r\nof life. Under rural conditions the obligation seems to have been\r\nperformed tolerably well, because violations of the law are rarer where\r\npopulation is thin. A sheriff, with the help of a few constables and\r\nthe power to summon citizens to his aid in times of special emergency,\r\nwas all the police that was needed in most communities. With the growth\r\nof the city the police problem was intensified even out of proportion\r\nto the numbers of the people. Keeping the peace came to mean no longer\r\nthe mere matter of quelling disturbances. The city with its teeming\r\npopulation not only bred violence and disorder, but it afforded\r\nopportunities for immunity through concealment. A new police problem\r\nquite foreign to the capacities of the ancient office of sheriff grew\r\nup. The city had to meet the professional, scientific criminal with\r\nspecialized instrumentalities and organization. Crowds on the congested\r\ncity streets had to be taken care of and numerous other incidentals of\r\nthe congested city had to be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe city likewise developed an entirely new problem of public charity,\r\nwhich quite outgrew the capacities of that amateur sociologist, the\r\ncounty poormaster.\r\n\r\nThe coroner, too, sadly missed the mark in numerous cases. In the\r\nnew industrial order in the cities, not only was criminal violence\r\nmultiplied but industrial fatalities added heavily to the terrors of\r\ncity life for the working class. The civil liabilities which were\r\nimposed upon employers and upon insurance companies made it more than\r\never important that every sudden or suspicious death be investigated\r\nwith the utmost scientific thoroughness. Such service it was of course\r\nimpossible for the untrained elective political coroner to render, and\r\nthe world will never know the costly mistakes that are chargeable to\r\nhis inexpertness.\r\n\r\nIn the fullness of time court organization also revealed the necessity\r\nfor differentiation between various classes of cases which were\r\npresented for settlement. Again, the protection of life against\r\ncommunicable diseases and of property against fire were two functions\r\nthat the rural local government had completely overlooked or neglected,\r\nand when urban conditions arose in the midst of the county there was\r\nnothing in the original local government machinery that could be made\r\nto respond to these needs. The county was apparently stereotyped to\r\nminister to local conditions as they were conceived in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. Its organization was merely adapted to\r\nperform the simple cut-and-dried services that had been laid down for\r\nit in centuries gone by. Its expansion into new and bigger fields of\r\nservice seems never to have been seriously considered.\r\n\r\nBut the pungent fact is that counties, when they have ceased to serve\r\nthe needs of urban life, have been so slow to retire from the field.\r\n\r\nWhat state has stripped the sheriff of his power to interfere in a riot\r\nor a strike to the infinite annoyance of the thousand per cent. more\r\ncompetent police force of the city? How very few states have shown the\r\ncoroner the door and replaced him with a scientifically trained medical\r\nexaminer! Not less ridiculous the board of county supervisors in great\r\ncities like Chicago, Cleveland and Milwaukee, solemnly ruling over a\r\nterritory almost identical in its extent with the bailiwick of the city\r\nauthorities. Why should not a single body do all the local regulating?\r\n\r\nAnd so, the urban county problem is first of all a question of\r\nill-adapted instruments of government perpetuated long past their\r\nperiod of utility.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it is a matter of duplication and conflict of\r\norganization and effort as between the city and the county. When the\r\ncharter in Los Angeles County was revised in 1912 it was found that in\r\nthe urban communities three separate groups of officers were charged\r\nwith keeping the peace: the sheriff and his deputies, the constables\r\nof the several townships and the police of the city. Their duties\r\nwere substantially the same, they covered the same ground. The public\r\nscattered its civic attention accordingly. It was this same state\r\nof California which within the last twenty years has authorized its\r\ncities to have separate tax assessors--two sets of officials to go\r\nout and get precisely the same information. Ever since that time the\r\ntaxable property in the city has been rated differently by the two sets\r\nof officers. And the reason? Apparently a double one: to enable the\r\nindividual counties to beat down their proportion of the state tax and\r\nat the same time to allow the cities to raise their valuations and keep\r\ndown the tax rate. The political value of a double set of officers is\r\nof course not to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nAn unpublished report of the City Club of Milwaukee reveals a\r\nparalleling of city and county services at numerous points. The city\r\nwas found to be maintaining an emergency hospital, a tuberculosis\r\nsanitarium and a corps of milk inspectors, while the county maintained\r\nsimilar services through a general hospital, a tuberculosis\r\nsanitarium, a visiting physician and a district nurse. The county jail\r\nand the police station were in close proximity but under separate\r\njurisdictions. Where the county handled public works through an\r\nengineering department the city operated through a highway department,\r\neach unit requiring practically the same sort of administrative and\r\ntechnical direction. City and county did their purchasing separately\r\nand in the respective public works departments there was a duplication\r\nof testing laboratories and of engineering and other service records.\r\nSeparate city and county regulative or governing bodies added\r\nmaterially both to the expense of government and to the number of\r\nelective officers.\r\n\r\nThen again, the urban county, including judicial officers, has\r\ncontributed more to the length of the ballot than any other division\r\nof government. In the year 1910 before the adoption of the present\r\ncharter, the Los Angeles city ballot, which has been frequently\r\nexhibited as a horrible example, contained the names of candidates for\r\nforty-five separate offices. Twenty-eight of these belonged to the\r\ncounty-township system!\r\n\r\nThe Chicago voter, as the result of the early influences plus the\r\nadditions to the number of offices which have been made from time to\r\ntime, casts a ballot for about twenty-five candidates, including the\r\nsheriff, the treasurer, county clerk, clerk of the probate court, clerk\r\nof the criminal court, president of the county commissioners, ten\r\ncounty commissioners, judge of the county court. The voter in Omaha, in\r\naddition to the usual run of county officers, selects also thirty-two\r\ndeputy tax assessors, all on a single ballot. In most states these\r\nofficers are chosen on the same day and on the same ballot with a long\r\nlist of state and judicial officers, so that the county election is\r\nonly an incidental and minor issue in the whole complicated business.\r\n\r\nOn election day the urban county offices are usually found at the\r\nbottom of the ballot. Usually numerous and obscure enough in their own\r\nright in the country districts, their contributions to the obscurity of\r\nvoting in the city are more than doubly important.\r\n\r\nWhen to an immoderately long ballot, to duplication of functions\r\nas between county and city, there is added a multiplicity of local\r\ngovernment units, all considerations of responsibility in government\r\nor intelligence of citizenship fall to the ground. Such is the case\r\nin Cook County, Illinois, where the Bureau of Public Efficiency\r\nhas issued a striking little pamphlet on _The Nineteen Local\r\nGovernments in Chicago_. (The number has since been increased\r\nto twenty-two.) Twenty-two separate taxing bodies, and one hundred\r\nand forty-four officials which every Chicago voter is expected to\r\nchoose! Is it a wonder that “Mr. Voter,” to quote the title of an\r\naccompanying cartoon, is “dazed?” As the pamphlet says: “The large\r\nnumber of local governments in Chicago, with their very large number\r\nof elective officials, independent of one another, operates to produce\r\nnot only inefficient public service but an enormous waste of public\r\nrevenues. The present multiplicity of governing bodies, with a lack\r\nof centralized control and the long ballot, results in confusing\r\ncomplexity and makes gross inefficiency and waste on a large scale\r\ninevitable.”\r\n\r\nThe city too has proven itself an altogether unfavorable environment\r\nfor clean, active county citizenship. A thousand and one preoccupations\r\nand distractions in the city have strongly tended to drive the\r\npopulace to forget that it even lives in a county. The county does\r\nlittle for the city dweller. It does not keep his house from burning\r\nor his pockets from being picked. It does not build the streets on\r\nwhich he travels nor perform any humane services which could stir his\r\nadmiration. The sheriff is no neighbor of his nor does he hear of\r\nthat officer from one year’s end to another, unless it be his rare\r\nfortune to be a party to some legal action. The newspapers, to be\r\nsure, are apt to give a great deal of space to criminal trials and\r\nfeature the activities of the district attorney. But even that is apt\r\nto be directed more to metropolitan sensationalism than to helpful\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe greater the power entrusted to the municipalities within the\r\ncounty, the more interesting things it is given to do, in just that\r\nmeasure does the county itself suffer from inattention on the part of\r\nthe citizens, till the extreme is reached in a condition described in\r\na report on Cook County by Prof. F. D. Bramhall of the University of\r\nChicago:\r\n\r\n “The city corporate stands in the mind of most men for their local\r\n government; it has its picturesque history, its visible physical\r\n embodiments, its corporate personality, its stimulus to the pride\r\n of its people and its claim upon their loyalty. The county can make\r\n no such appeal, and it is a political fact to be reckoned with that\r\n however you may urge that the county is an essential part of city\r\n government, that the city electorate is almost equivalent to the\r\n county electorate, and should assert an equal proprietorship, it is\r\n almost impossible to overcome the obsession that the county is an\r\n alien thing. There is no more serious consequence of the parceling out\r\n of our local governmental powers and the shattering of responsibility\r\n for our municipal housekeeping than just this forfeiture of the sense\r\n of identification with government and the force of local patriotism\r\n which should be a tremendous asset for American political government.”\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the urban, and particularly the metropolitan county,\r\nis the county at its worst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOUNTY GOVERNMENTS AT WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n“Granted the truth of all you say; that every county officer stands on\r\nhis independent pedestal of authority, that the county is a headless\r\ninstitution where responsibility is scattered in a thousand different\r\ndirections; that urban counties are the weakest brothers in the\r\npolitical family--granted all that, but what of it?”\r\n\r\nSo cogitates the “average American”--or so it would seem. If he reads\r\nhis county paper consistently he has been held in his seat over and\r\nover again by the hackneyed lines of Pope:\r\n\r\n  “For forms of government let fools contest;\r\n  What e’er is best administered is best.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long course of mental stimulation along these lines, we are\r\nquite prepared to hear him remark that after all what really counts\r\nfor government is MEN--an observation which is supposed to\r\nsilence all contradiction. Your “average” friend, if he has more than\r\nan average political energy, then goes out and helps to see that the\r\n“right sort” of man is elected coroner.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly more than an element of truth and wisdom in all\r\nthese sentiments. The industrial world is coming more and more to\r\nbelieve that the great essential in coöperative effort of any sort is\r\nnot plan of organization, not methods, but personnel--men. And even\r\ngovernment presents instances of men who have “made good” conspicuously\r\nagainst a form of organization which favored insubordination, against\r\nthe interference of invisible powers, against the hundred and one\r\ncunningly devised handicaps to good administration.\r\n\r\nWe might with good grace take kindly to a system that brought\r\ndistinguished, capable, honest, well-qualified men for the public\r\nservice. If we could get good men and good administration as the normal\r\noutput of the existing systems of county government, there would be\r\nsatisfaction all around.\r\n\r\nBut does the typical American government work that way? We shall\r\nexamine in this chapter the relationships between the system, the men\r\nand the product.\r\n\r\nTo get the right angle on the subject, we should put ourselves in the\r\nposition of, let us say, the sheriff of Pike County. He is a likable,\r\npopular fellow--that is how he happens to be sheriff. His likability,\r\nhis popularity, have made him a particularly valuable adjunct of the\r\nPike County Republican (or Democratic) organization. In the election\r\ncampaign he has proven himself a vote-getter, he has given the\r\norganization a respectable tone. And now that he is in office his\r\ncongenital good nature has not been changed. His popularity has been\r\ndue to his unfailing loyalty to his friends and supporters. These good\r\npeople swarm about him on the first day of his term and he has it not\r\nin his heart to refuse the only favor within his power to grant.\r\n\r\nSo much for one set of claimants upon his favor. But there is also the\r\nwhole body of his supporters, the general electorate and the tax-paying\r\ncontingent of the county; they have a claim upon him too and the new\r\nsheriff enters upon his duties with a sincere desire to serve them by\r\nrunning his office in the most efficient and economical manner. The\r\nsignificant part of the whole business is that these two ambitions are\r\nmore than likely to prove inconsistent. Personal friendship dictates\r\nthat he should hand out deputyships to “the boys” of his own heart;\r\npublic service, that he should ignore the claims of friendship and\r\nman his office with competent assistants, regardless of personal,\r\npolitical or ecclesiastical connections. And so the new officer,\r\nthrough a situation not of his own making, is caught in a dilemma.\r\nProbably nine out of ten county officials either resolve the difficulty\r\non the grounds of friendship or strike a compromise between their\r\nconflicting desires--and the efficiency of the office in either case\r\nis impaired. Every man coming into an office with favors to dispense\r\nhas strings attached to his person. He cannot look his public duties\r\nquite squarely in the eye, but has always to qualify every new plan,\r\nevery selection of a subordinate with “What will the county chairman\r\nsay?” And if he has ambitions to hold office for a second term, or to\r\ngo higher, he is naturally careful about irritating the goose that lays\r\nthe golden egg. For the county chairman is not apt to be keen about the\r\nplans for economy or reducing the number of jobs for “the boys.” Such\r\nplans do not fit in with his requirements.\r\n\r\nThe system hamstrings the man. Once a county officer in New Jersey\r\nneeded two additional clerks. Believing, however, that the board of\r\nchosen freeholders was following a strict program of economy, he went\r\nto them asking for four new men, with the thought that his requisition\r\nwould be cut in half. But not so. The official and the board were of\r\nopposite parties. A member of the board came around and remarked that\r\n“you need _eight_ new men.” The officer is said to have taken the\r\nhint and jobs were accordingly provided for four deserving members of\r\neach of the leading parties.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is clearly not personality but the system that\r\ndominates.\r\n\r\nThe enforced division of allegiance between party and people is but\r\na single source of personal inefficiency. Under the much lauded\r\n“government of laws” that reaches the heights of absurdity in the\r\ncounty, the chance of effective law enforcement is reduced to a\r\nminimum. Take it for instance in the exact compliance with statutory\r\nprocedure. The sale of a piece of real estate for non-payment of taxes,\r\nfor instance, must be conducted in accord with a detailed series of\r\nsteps set forth in the law, or the title of the property is clouded.\r\nClaims for payment for services rendered or material supplied, may\r\nalso be legally allowed only after the proper formalities have been\r\nobserved. And in countless other directions the efficiency of the\r\ncounty officers and employees must be measured principally by a\r\nmeticulous obedience to the law.\r\n\r\nBut contrast the necessity with the performance: The former chief of\r\nthe Bureau of Municipal Accounts in the Comptroller’s office of an\r\neastern state, after examining the affairs of fifty-six counties,\r\nwas able in 1914 to say: “In not a single county examined has there\r\nbeen found compliance with every provision of law. On the contrary,\r\nin each of the counties examined serious irregularities in financial\r\ntransactions have been disclosed, and the taxpayers’ money illegally\r\nexpended, in some cases beyond recovery.”\r\n\r\nThe comptroller’s agents examined the affairs of county “A.” Of the\r\ntransactions for the year ending October 31, 1913, they said: “County\r\nadministration during that year was carried on, in many important\r\nrespects, illegally, and in many cases the officials completely ignored\r\nthe law, resulting in waste of public money, amounting to many\r\nthousands of dollars.” The former treasurer of this county, according\r\nto the official report, “had, it would seem, no proper conception of\r\nthe legal duties imposed upon him. He made payments of unauthorized\r\ndrafts of committees of the board.... His important statutory duty to\r\npay only on proper legal authority apparently constituted meaningless\r\nwords.” The same authority reported that:\r\n\r\n “The board of supervisors ordered payments that were without authority\r\n of law, to the extent of many thousands of dollars. The illegalities\r\n in the audits of the board of supervisors were particularly\r\n objectionable because of the fact that many of the subjects of\r\n criticism were called to the board’s attention in the report of\r\n a former examination. Illegal payments under such circumstances\r\n became a defiance of legal restriction.... The administration of\r\n the poor fund was not in accord with the law and through a failure\r\n of the officials to understand the requirements of the law and the\r\n necessities of the county, the lack of proper coöperation between the\r\n county treasurer, the superintendent of the poor, and the board of\r\n supervisors, confusion resulted in the poor fund finances and a large\r\n deficit accumulated which was financed by illegal temporary loans....\r\n The county has suffered to a material extent from inefficiency,\r\n indifference to law and neglect.”\r\n\r\nThat discoveries were by no means local or unique is indicated by\r\nperiodical complaints that have come up from other parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWas it men, as such, or was it not also a system that gave rise to the\r\nevidences of bad government in County “B.”? Did it simply _happen_\r\nthat the treasurer, the county judge, the district attorney, the\r\nsheriff and the justices of the peace were all breaking the laws at\r\nonce? Is it to be supposed that law-breaking flourished naturally in\r\nthe atmosphere of that particular region? The performances of these\r\nofficers are both so instructive and picturesque that they will bear a\r\nbrief recounting here.\r\n\r\nThe examiners of the affairs of this county a few years ago turned up\r\nthis quaint little document:\r\n\r\n  “ELLENBERG CENTER, Nov. 21, 1900.\r\n\r\n  County of....................., Dr.,\r\n    to Wellington Hay.\r\n\r\n  1898, Sept. 22. To 7 days’ labor with deputy\r\n    sheriff looking up stolen horse              $14.00\r\n  To paid all expenses\r\n    per above                                     15.60\r\n                                                 ------\r\n                                                 $29.60\r\n\r\n “Mr. Hay performed services in following up two horse thieves who had\r\n stolen his horse at my request as sheriff, one of the men, George\r\n Burnham, had several indictments against him in this county and all\r\n who knew his doings were anxious for his capture, I certainly think\r\n Mr. Hay should be paid.\r\n\r\n  “C. W. VAUGHAN,\r\n  “_Late Sheriff_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance, Mr. Hay, a deputy sheriff, was charging the county\r\nfor chasing up _his own_ horse. The county treasurer who paid this\r\nclaim was the one who, in spite of very definite provisions of law, had\r\nfailed to designate the banks which should have custody of the county\r\nfunds, and deposited them with a favored institution which paid the\r\ncounty no interest; who failed to keep any cash book or any account\r\nwith any bank even on the stubs of his check book; who allowed at least\r\none creditor of the county to collect an illegal claim four times.\r\nThis is the county in which the county judge was found to have his\r\nown private law offices elaborately furnished with all the up-to-date\r\nfiling devices and blanks, all at the public expense; in which the\r\ncoroner reports that between the 13th and the 19th of May he had worked\r\n_fifteen days_ and collected in full from the county. The records\r\nof practically every other officer in the county revealed similar\r\nirregularities and a similar lack of any fine sense of the interests of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nDid it just _happen_ that the people of county “A” or county “B”\r\nelected none but law-breakers to office? Was it the character of the\r\nofficers which alone was responsible for “inefficiency, indifference to\r\nlaw and neglect?” Would the condition have been different with another\r\naverage set of men in office?\r\n\r\nThis is certain: that upon the officers of county “A” was imposed\r\nthe duty of enforcing laws which were both intricate and difficult\r\nfor a layman to find, and when found, to understand. But over and\r\nabove all this, there was no constant discipline of a responsible\r\norganization and no certain and swift penalty for non-compliance with\r\nor disobedience of the law.\r\n\r\nSo difficult is the case, in fact, that it would seem from reports\r\nemanating from different parts of the country, that county officers\r\nhave long ceased to worry about the legality of most of their acts. A\r\ncommon practice is not to investigate the law at all but to look back\r\nover the work of predecessors and follow in their tracks--an easier and\r\nmore natural method for the untrained mind than to seek legal authority\r\nfor action at its fountainhead in the statutes. But it makes a joke of\r\nthe statutes! And when, in the absence of a powerful executive head,\r\nthese written laws, which constitute most important connecting link,\r\nbetween the various county officers, are broken, the directing hand of\r\nthe state is perforce withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe failures of government in these counties were due in no small\r\nmeasure at least to the system, rather than to the individual men. No\r\nmere “good” man would necessarily have been better qualified or more\r\ninclined to look up the law and follow it implicitly. For it is not of\r\nsuch qualities that political “goodness,” from the voters’ standpoint,\r\nconsists!\r\n\r\nNor are these minor delinquencies the sole products of the evil system.\r\nIn Hudson County, New Jersey, with a citizenry somewhat less alert\r\nand with state officials a little less vigilant, the essential factors\r\npresent in the counties mentioned gave rise to positive conscienceless\r\nand willful waste of public funds. The story is illuminating:\r\n\r\nThe building of the court house was begun under an act of the\r\nlegislature which authorized a committee of the board of chosen\r\nfreeholders to purchase such lands and erect such county buildings\r\nas might be needed. The committee was empowered to appoint its own\r\ncounsel and architect to go ahead and build. The only limitation upon\r\nits powers was that it should spend not to exceed four fifths of one\r\nper cent. of the county ratables. This was a restriction which, under\r\nthe amount of ratables as of the time when the project was authorized,\r\nwould have permitted a maximum expenditure of about $1,580,000. But\r\nbefore even the contracts had been let the growth in valuations had so\r\nincreased that the committee might legally spend $7,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe original figure for the cost of the court house had been $990,000,\r\nbut before the citizens of the county were aroused it reached\r\n$3,328,016. Investigation revealed such extravagance and carelessness\r\nwith the county’s money in every detail, that the legislature in 1911\r\nabolished the committee and created a court house commission, the\r\nmembers of which were to be appointed by the Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe building of county court houses under just such auspices and\r\nwith a similar outcome is a characteristic bit of local history the\r\ncountry over. But county shortcomings do not always stop at willful\r\nextravagance. Sometimes it is a tale of grafting of the grossest sort,\r\nof which typical conditions a story is related by Herbert Quick, who\r\nhad charge of an investigation into the affairs of Woodbury County,\r\nIowa, some twenty years ago. The county supervisors apparently had\r\ntraveled unobserved, unchecked, along the same road but further, as the\r\nofficers of county “A” and the court house committee of Hudson County.\r\nSays Mr. Quick:\r\n\r\n“A supervisor would draw thousands of dollars from the road and bridge\r\nfunds on his own warrant, put the money in his pocket, and account\r\nfor it by turning in receipts for road or bridge work. Some of this\r\nwork was done and some was not. Most of the receipts were signed by\r\npolitical supporters of the supervisors. To some of them were signed\r\nnames of persons who never existed.\r\n\r\n“Everything the county bought was extravagantly bought. Any dealer who\r\nwas willing to put in padded bills could get the chance to sell his\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n“There was a regular system of letting bills go unpaid so that the\r\npersons furnishing the goods would put in the statements the second\r\ntime, after which they would be paid twice--once to the firm to which\r\nthey were really owing, and again to one or more of the county ring.\r\nIn most cases the merchant furnishing the goods never knew of the\r\ndouble payment. They had a system of orders and receipts by which the\r\nmerchant was kept in ignorance.\r\n\r\n“In some cases the approaches to bridges were built and charged twice,\r\nonce to the road fund and once to the bridge fund. The man who did the\r\nwork got one payment and the grafters got the other. The people paid\r\ntwice in these cases, and sometimes three times.\r\n\r\n“A merchant sold some blankets to the county for the use of the\r\nprisoners in the jail. He was allowed about a hundred dollars on the\r\ncounty claim register, but refused to accept the payment and sued the\r\ncounty. In court he recovered judgment for all he claimed, and was paid\r\nout of the judgment fund. The general fund claim he had refused to\r\naccept showed as unpaid. Somebody on the inside went to him and got an\r\norder for ‘any sums due me from the county’ and drew the original bill\r\nover again. So the county paid the original allowance, the amount of\r\nthe judgment, and the costs of the lawsuit. Rather dear blankets!\r\n\r\n“Orders of this sort were drawn in the names of the people who had been\r\ndead for years.\r\n\r\n“This is a sample of the sort of work which prevailed in that county,\r\nand which plunged the county into debt from which it will not recover,\r\nthe way things generally go, for generations.”\r\n\r\nIn Indiana the leaven of obscurity and irresponsibility had long been\r\nworking when the state board of accounts took up its work in 1909. The\r\nrecords of that office since that time show that more than one million\r\nsix hundred thousand dollars had been charged against local officials\r\nand partly recovered. The board states that in their belief fully\r\nninety per cent. of this was not due to deliberate wrongdoing but to an\r\nindulgent indifference, resulting in an almost endless confusion and\r\nincomplete accounts. Like the county officers in many another state,\r\nthe officials in the Indiana counties, according to a message of former\r\nGovernor Mount, “had been following precedents on an ascending scale.”\r\n\r\nIf the whole trouble lies in the personnel of government, there is\r\neither no real county problem or else the problem is unsolved. If it\r\nis merely a matter of men, the voters of the county need only, when\r\nthe next election falls due, to “turn the rascals out” and elect more\r\npromising successors. But then that is what the voters have been doing\r\nthese many years, and county government has not materially improved!\r\n\r\nBut if when the “good man” theory has been tested to the limit and\r\nfound wanting, nothing else appears, may it not be suggested that the\r\nsystem has much to do with the man first in his selection and then in\r\nthe influence that determines his conduct? The officers in the counties\r\ncited were creatures of the flesh. They found themselves involved in\r\nan organization which not only gave them little or no moral support,\r\nbut which actually surrounded them with temptation to loaf, to commit\r\nerrors and to steal. They were under no discipline to obey the law or\r\nto treat the interests of the county with any due consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of government, as in the department of horticulture, it\r\nwould appear that figs are not gathered from thistles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE HUMANITARIAN SIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the delinquencies of the county are not wholly related in terms\r\nof finance. Some good friend of the system is sure to come forward\r\nwith the remark that “county policies, like every other branch of\r\nthe business, may be expensive, but it has a good deal of wholesome\r\nhumanity about it.”\r\n\r\nA view that is worth examining!\r\n\r\nTo the lot of the county, acting through the machinery and under the\r\ninfluences which have been described, has fallen in large part, the\r\nextensive and important governmental burden of looking after the poor\r\nwho are always with us, the sick in mind and those in prison. The\r\nmagnitude of this task in a populous center may be gathered from this\r\nsummary of the humanitarian functions of Cook County, by Dr. Graham\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\n“It housed, fed and cared for about eleven thousand prisoners in the\r\ncounty jail, nearly ten thousand of whom required medical treatment for\r\ninfectious diseases.\r\n\r\n“It gathered in, temporarily cared for and committed to state asylums\r\nor discharged, 2334 insane patients.\r\n\r\n“It assumed and maintained care for 10,597 delinquent and dependent\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n“It isolated and stamped out contagion.\r\n\r\n“It housed, fed and furnished medical and surgical treatment for 34,000\r\nsick people, 1000 tuberculosis patients, and 3000 aged, infirm or\r\nirresponsible people.\r\n\r\n“It supplied food, clothing and fuel to about 200,000 persons; buried\r\n978 pauper and friendless dead, and granted $165,000 to 350 indigent\r\nmothers for the support of 1126 children. To perform this service it\r\nrequired the full time of 3000 employees and part time of about 10,000\r\nothers. The appropriations of Cook County for 1913 total $7,072,486.96.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the budget of what we may call the human problem of a great\r\nmetropolitan county. Between the services rendered in such a unit and\r\nthose of a sparsely settled, back-country county, almost anywhere in\r\nthe United States, the difference is one of degree rather than of kind.\r\n\r\nThis is the ancient heritage of the church, which it has gradually\r\ntransferred to the shoulders of the State, beginning at a time when\r\nthe treatment of unfortunates was yet mostly a matter of getting\r\nundesirable citizens out of the way without actually assassinating\r\nthem. The recipients of relief in early times were all treated as just\r\nso much of a public charge and all were obliged to wear the letter\r\n“P.” There was no science of penology, and the insane were treated\r\nas possessed of devils. Modern institutional care was practically\r\nundreamed of.\r\n\r\nBut the care of unfortunates within the last half century has come\r\nunder the dominion of the scientific spirit. The old way was to\r\n“bunch” all kinds of poor and all kinds of dependents and all classes\r\nof criminals, regardless of all antecedent circumstances and all\r\nhope of betterment. Science, on the other hand, has demanded first,\r\ninvestigation into the causes and nature of crime and deficiency, then\r\nclassification of cases. New York led the way in the treatment of\r\nthese social relief problems by starting the process of segregation.\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century the almshouses in America\r\nand the workhouse in England began to be built, as an expedient for\r\nfacilitating investigation of applicants and decreasing expense. These\r\ninstitutions were soon used to house all sorts and conditions of men,\r\nwomen and children. Says one authority[4]:\r\n\r\n “If you went into an almshouse in any of the counties of this State\r\n as recently as the ’70s of the last century, you would have found a\r\n mixture of the aged, who were in the almshouse simply because they\r\n were old and misfortune had come to them and they had lost their\r\n money and were therefore obliged to spend their last days in the\r\n almshouse. In addition, you would find children of all ages, beginning\r\n with infants. A large number of infants, especially illegitimate\r\n children, would be housed in the same building and would be cared\r\n for promiscuously with the older groups. You would also find large\r\n numbers of the insane, as there was no separate provision for them at\r\n that time. So with the epileptic and feeble-minded and every class of\r\n dependent vagrant and inebriate. It was a veritable dumping-ground for\r\n all sorts and conditions of humanity.”\r\n\r\nIn the movement for segregation of cases the first step was to secure\r\na prohibition against the commitment of children to the almshouses.\r\nSpecial provision was later made for the insane. From time to time\r\nother classes of cases, including the feeble-minded, the epileptics and\r\nvagrants, have been transferred for appropriate treatment elsewhere.\r\nLater came the public health movement, the basic idea of which is\r\nthe segregation of the sick poor from those who are sound in body\r\nbut destitute. Even at the present time the almshouses are used for\r\ninebriates.\r\n\r\nIn a later period the standards for the treatment of prisoners have\r\nbeen advanced somewhat more slowly but along the same scientific\r\nprinciple of classification and segregation, but less with reference to\r\npsychological and sociological causes or the nature of crime than to\r\nthe conveniences of administration. But segregation has been prescribed\r\nby law in generous measure according to certain crude principles of\r\ndecency and justice. Thus the New York Prison law provides at least ten\r\nclassifications, involving separation of men from women, men from boys,\r\npersons awaiting trial from those under sentence, civil prisoners and\r\nwitnesses from criminal prisoners.\r\n\r\nSo much for the modern standards. Against such standards the success or\r\nfailure of the county as a humanitarian agency must be measured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POOR\r\n\r\nFirst as to the poor.\r\n\r\nWe can do no better than to recount the performances of certain typical\r\nstates. Certainly in New York the substantial improvement of this\r\nclass has come through no strong impulse within the county itself, but\r\nrather as the result of the activities of unusually strong volunteer\r\norganizations which forced the fact of the evil conditions upon the\r\nattention of the officers and the people of the county and upon the\r\nstate in general. But lest it should be supposed that New York State\r\nis a model in this field, let it be recorded that when by more or\r\nless of an accident Mr. V. Everit Macy, a real friend of scientific\r\ncharity, was elected to the office of superintendent of the poor, he\r\nfound a system more ideally fitted to take care of “the boys” in the\r\n“organization” than the poor themselves. In describing the system he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“The law ingeniously divides responsibility so that the superintendent\r\nhas no power over the admissions to the almshouse or hospitals or of\r\nchildren to institutions but only the negative power of discharge,\r\nwhile the local committing officials have little control after the\r\nadult or child is committed. This often results in setting up an\r\nendless chain of commitments and discharges, for, as fast as the\r\nsuperintendent discharges an adult or a child, the local official may\r\nrecommit.\r\n\r\n“The superintendent is on a salary but practically all the overseers\r\nare paid on a _per diem_ basis, and the justices of the peace are\r\npaid a fee for each commitment. If an Overseer issues an order for\r\ngroceries or signs a commitment, he can collect his two dollars for a\r\nday’s work.\r\n\r\n“Could ingenuity devise a more absurd and wasteful method of relieving\r\nsuffering or one where responsibility and control could be more\r\ndisastrously divided to the injury of the taxpayer and the poor?”[5]\r\n\r\nThe same authority is responsible for the statement that “the\r\ngreatest injustice to the individual and injury to the state is now\r\ndone through the haphazard handling of the cases of delinquent and\r\ndestitute children.” Overseers of the poor, justices of the peace,\r\npolice magistrates and judges can all commit children and most of these\r\nofficials have a monetary interest in committing. Few of them have\r\nany means of investigating cases before acting and fewer still have\r\nany training to fit them to deal wisely with either the destitute or\r\ndelinquent child.\r\n\r\nBut what of other states?\r\n\r\nIn Missouri where poor relief is a function of the county court, a\r\ncounty almshouse is maintained and a certain amount of outdoor relief\r\nis dispensed. Professor Isador Loeb[6] of the University of Missouri\r\nreports:\r\n\r\n “While the county board is authorized to maintain a county hospital\r\n for the sick poor, this has been done in only one county. Nine\r\n counties still use the primitive system of sending the poor to board\r\n with private families. Most of the counties in abandoning this system\r\n have bought a farm and employed a superintendent to look after the\r\n poor and use them as far as possible on the farm. As a result the\r\n almshouse in the majority of the counties is a farmhouse, and the\r\n county is apparently more interested in the successful management of\r\n the farm than the welfare of the inmates. While a number of counties\r\n have erected modern buildings, the physical conditions in most of the\r\n almshouses are very bad.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to Pennsylvania, the special agent of the department of\r\npublic health and charities writes[7]:\r\n\r\n “Twenty-seven counties have now accepted the Children’s Aid Society as\r\n their agent for the care of dependent children. In the other counties\r\n nearly every possible method of caring for children is represented\r\n in the courses chosen. Where the township system is in use, the few\r\n dependent children are placed out by adoption or indenture, by the\r\n overseers themselves. Several counties have built homes for the\r\n children, an expensive method, with no merit so far as the favorable\r\n situation of the children is concerned. Some of the overseers place\r\n the children in institutions, while others use private homes to some\r\n extent, controlling and supervising the children themselves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSANE\r\n\r\nIn no branch of humanitarian service is segregation, classification,\r\neven to the point of individual treatment, more essential than in the\r\ncare of the insane. New Jersey puts no inconsiderable number of her\r\nmentally afflicted on a par with offenders against the criminal law\r\nfor, according to the Commission on the Care of the Mental Defectives\r\nfor the year 1913, fifteen counties had confined insane persons in\r\npenal institutions, in some cases for periods of from 85 to 223 days.\r\nThe State Charity Commission in Illinois recently reported that in\r\nspite of a provision of the statutes forbidding such practices, only\r\neleven of the 102 counties did not so offend. Louisiana is reported to\r\nhave many lunatics in its parish jails.\r\n\r\nIn but few states are there no insane in the county almshouses, for\r\nat least temporary confinement, and particularly is this true in the\r\nSouth and Middle West. In such institutions a condition sometimes\r\nprevails that staggers imagination. For the state of Pennsylvania, Dr.\r\nC. Floyd Haviland has summed up the situation in these words:\r\n\r\n “As a result of the existing system, in these institutions, custodial\r\n care is generally substituted for active remedial treatment directed\r\n to the improvement or the recovery of the insane as such. As a\r\n rule, medical treatment for physical ills is satisfactory, although\r\n such is not invariably the case. With but few exceptions, the\r\n county institutions have no special medical facilities, nor can\r\n it be expected that such facilities can be provided under present\r\n conditions, for, with the comparatively small number of patients\r\n treated in the respective institutions, such provisions would require\r\n a prohibitive _per capita_ expense; but as a result of such\r\n lack of facilities, mechanical means of restraint and confinement\r\n are substituted for proper personal treatment and attention. With\r\n but a limited number of attendants, enclosed exercise yards and\r\n personal restraint and seclusion must inevitably result. Under\r\n existing conditions, one cannot blame the caretakers of the insane for\r\n resorting to such means, for while restraint and seclusion can and\r\n should be abolished, they cannot be successfully abolished without\r\n the substitution of other means of dealing with the disturbed insane,\r\n such as hydrotherapy, occupational training, and close personal\r\n supervision. In this connection it is agreeable to note that little\r\n evidence was obtained of actual physical abuse, but that gross neglect\r\n exists is indisputable.\r\n\r\n “That the theory of county hospitals for the chronic insane only\r\n does not obtain in actual practice is but a necessary result of the\r\n prevailing custom of determining the question as to whether a patient\r\n shall be committed to a state hospital, regardless of prognosis or\r\n medical issues, in many instances the decision being made by local\r\n lay authorities without medical advice. It is certain that many acute\r\n cases have lapsed into chronicity in the county hospitals simply for\r\n lack of proper treatment. Dreary, desolate wards, lack of recreation,\r\n or other means of exciting or maintaining active interest are alone\r\n sufficient not only to hinder improvement or recovery, but must\r\n necessarily result in actually hastening the terminal process of\r\n deterioration.”[8]\r\n\r\nWriting concerning the treatment of the insane in Texas, Dr. Thomas\r\nW. Salmon, of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene calls county\r\nalmshouse care of the insane the “saddest and most sordid spectacle\r\nin American community life.” For a graphic picture of the practical\r\nsignificance of the system in one of the almshouses in that state the\r\nreader is urged to read the extracts from Dr. Salmon’s address in the\r\nAppendix of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY PRISONS\r\n\r\nBut what of the treatment of the prisoner?\r\n\r\nThe county theoretically has very little to do with persons convicted\r\nof serious offenses. By far the greater number of the inmates of the\r\nprison are persons awaiting trial and therefore presumably innocent of\r\nwrongdoing. The minimum standard of justice demands that such persons\r\nbe kept apart from hardened criminals. We shall see how this and other\r\nstandards are observed in the county.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it should be noted that the head of the jail,\r\nuniversally, is the sheriff. Bear in mind that this officer in\r\nforty-seven states is elective, that his term is usually very short,\r\nthat he is usually ineligible to succeed himself and that he has\r\nnumerous special duties to perform. It is therefore obvious that\r\nnothing but an exceptional piece of good luck can bring to the head of\r\nthe jail an expert penologist. Often, too, he will be under contract\r\nwith the board of supervisors to supply the prisoners with food at as\r\ngood a profit to himself as may be.\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere it is certainly not to be expected that the finest\r\nflowers of penology should grow. Massachusetts has so far fallen\r\nbelow standard as to call forth this stinging description from the\r\nMassachusetts Prison Association:\r\n\r\n “In fact, in the county prisons nothing is done but to give the\r\n inmates custodial care. The man who goes to the reformatory is dealt\r\n with with a definite purpose to reform him. Another man goes to a\r\n county prison and comes out unchanged.\r\n\r\n “Even worse is the indiscriminate association of all sorts of\r\n criminals in the county prisons. Beginners in crime are forced into\r\n close contact with hardened criminals. Men who are committed for\r\n being too poor to pay their fines for petty offenses, are compelled\r\n to associate with men who have spent their lives in crime. The county\r\n prison is, inevitably a school of crime.”[9]\r\n\r\nThe Prison Association in New York State is scarcely more complimentary\r\nconcerning the prison conditions in that state. According to Mr.\r\nO. F. Lewis,[10], its secretary, the requirements of the statutes\r\nrespecting the classification of prisoners appear to be systematically\r\nviolated. Jails are frightfully overcrowded. The buildings are faultily\r\nconstructed and unsanitary. For a prisoner to make a six-months’ stay\r\nin one of them is to undergo “the most serious possible contamination.”\r\n\r\nThe condition of the jails in Illinois is apparently no better, for\r\nthe State Charities Commission reported recently,[11], there had been\r\nlittle improvement since the first examination of the former State\r\nCharities Board in 1870. A large majority of the jails were reported to\r\nbe old and unsanitary. In seventy-two of one hundred and two counties,\r\nthe law requiring the segregation of minors from adults was violated\r\nand in eleven counties there was no provision for women.\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes. The county as a truly humanitarian agency has most\r\nlamentably failed. As to the underlying cause of the failure, this is\r\nsuggested in a remark of the state prison inspector of Alabama in his\r\nreport for 1914: “Publicity is not only a political antiseptic, but\r\nis the sure antidote for most, if not all, our governmental ills.” A\r\njustifiable inference from this declaration would be that counties\r\nare suffering from the lack of publicity. In the immunity from the\r\nrestraint which such a purifying influence would supply the elementary\r\nhuman instincts of county officials has full sway--such instincts as\r\nthe inspector had in mind when he said:\r\n\r\n “The vile, pernicious, perverting, fee system beggars description, and\r\n my vocabulary is inadequate to describe its deleterious and baneful\r\n effects. It inculcates into the management of our jails greed for the\r\n Almighty Dollar; persons are arrested because of the dollar and shame\r\n to say, are frequently kept in captivity for months, in steel cages,\r\n for no other reason than the Almighty Dollar.”\r\n\r\nThe organization of the county for political purposes to secure\r\nthe utmost obscurity and irresponsibility breaks the force of any\r\nhumanitarian public opinion that might be developed for the betterment\r\nof the lot of the unfortunate. The same influences render the county\r\npractically uninhabitable for the expert administrator, who would\r\nbe likely to direct popular attention to the evil conditions which\r\nwe have described. His place has been preëmpted by the hanger-on and\r\nthe wire-puller to whom charity means the dispensing of favors to\r\n“deserving” workers of all political faiths. In _this_ sense the\r\ncounty is a very humane institution, and a very open-handed one. It\r\nserves well such local officials as the overseer of the poor in an\r\nup-state New York county who presented this remarkable annual report to\r\nhis superior:\r\n\r\n “I am a little late with my report. I hope you will excuse me and\r\n overlook the matter. Like last year, there are no county poor here;\r\n but if you will allow me $5.00 _for keeping them off_, you will\r\n oblige,\r\n\r\n  “Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n  “----.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis claim was paid and the poor were presumably “kept off”\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nThere is not a little evidence to support the statement that many\r\ncounty officers believe that they have satisfied the requirements of\r\nhumanity when they have taken care of their own personal wants. Such\r\nofficers, and the system of which they are part, are very good--to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[4] Bailey B.

Through these avenues of communication\r\nthe people of the wilderness were to break their solitude, establish\r\ncommon understandings and give value to the products of the earth by\r\ncreating markets for their distribution. Over the highways access was\r\nto be had with schools and churches.\r\n\r\nFrom the colonial period and well down into the nineteenth century,\r\nthe construction and maintenance of roads was, in diminishing degree,\r\na private enterprise, operated by turnpike companies primarily for\r\nthe benefit of their stock-holders rather than that of the public.\r\nGradually road making came to be regarded as a public function, at\r\nfirst in respect to the repairs upon the private toll roads and then in\r\noriginal construction. In the year 1913 the amount which counties of\r\nthe country spent upon their highways had mounted to $55,514,891.\r\n\r\nTo the fulfillment of this great function the county brought those\r\nweaknesses of governmental organization, that lack of equipment, that\r\ndefective loyalty to the service of the whole people which have been\r\ndescribed heretofore. The erection of a road system was a demand for\r\nbroad, foreseeing knowledge and appreciation of the needs of the whole\r\ncounty, high technical skill in the art of road making and adequate\r\nfinancial arrangements. The county supplied none of these.\r\n\r\nWhat the county did supply and how it supplied it may be worth the\r\nrecital, even though in these days of the “good-roads” movement the\r\nstate government is constantly stiffening its hold upon highway matters.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the whole public road function is rooted, historically,\r\nin the tradition of the people’s infinite political versatility and\r\ninfallibility. The true democrat of the nineteenth century never\r\ndoubted his ability to select and control the human agents for\r\nexecuting a technical and difficult engineering problem, which has\r\nbaffled the resources of modern specialists. And so, to this day, the\r\nmanagement of road construction and care over a great portion of the\r\ncountry is entrusted to a farmer, a blacksmith, a plumber or some other\r\nspecies of layman who has sufficient popularity with his neighbors\r\nand the county chairman to get himself chosen as town supervisor. In\r\nsome states the rôle of road manager is played by the somewhat better\r\nequipped county surveyor, who, however, like the supervisor, is picked\r\nin the majority of cases because of his vote-getting qualities rather\r\nthan for any technical training.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the roadmaster is apt to enter upon his\r\npublic duties with a sense of his obligation not to the whole community\r\nand its ultimate interest, but to those articulate sections of the\r\npeople who are most likely to make themselves felt on the next election\r\nday. As a certain highway engineer illustrated the situation: “Here’s\r\n$10,000 to spend on roads. Here also is Jeff Browning up on Nut Creek,\r\nwho wants quite a little road work done. Of course, Jeff lives fifteen\r\nmiles from the county seat, and there’s fifteen miles of bad roads\r\nbetween his place and town, _but Jeff voted the whole settlement for\r\nme_, and he has some idle teams, and we’ll just help him along by\r\nspending some money at his place.” It is one of the familiar processes\r\nof practical politics and the imagination should have no difficulty in\r\npicturing any number of equally accommodating transactions.\r\n\r\nQuite as serious an aspect of road control directly by elective\r\nofficers is that it gives too great and too convenient an opportunity\r\nfor layman advice and prejudice to bear upon a technical problem. One\r\ncurious idea which is prevalent in middle western rural districts\r\nis that a road, in order to be a road, must be on a section line,\r\nregardless of the contour of the land, the convenience of users of the\r\nhighway or the character of the soil. The engineer above quoted tells\r\nof a very bad hill about two miles north of Poplar Bluff, Mo. “The\r\ngrade,” says Mr. Edy, “must have been something like twelve per cent.\r\nin places. It was estimated that by going around this hill, a grade of\r\nsix per cent. could be obtained, increasing the distance but slightly,\r\nand traversing almost worthless ground. The owner, however, would\r\nneither give nor sell a right of way, holding that unless the road were\r\nmaintained ‘on the line’ it would not be a real road. Something like\r\n$400 was spent on this bill in an effort to make it passable, when half\r\nthat amount would have made a permanent road in a new location.”\r\n\r\nOf course, when the organization of the county gives to Jeff Browning\r\nand the philosopher of Poplar Bluff the predominating influence in road\r\naffairs, there can be nothing in the way of a county road policy or\r\nroad plan that is based upon the economic and social needs of the whole\r\npeople. The system enthrones petty rural sectionalism and narrowness\r\nand condones a form of graft which is without doubt as vicious in\r\nprinciple as the stealing of a street railway franchise. Where the\r\ntownship supervisor is the responsible official the case is at its\r\nworst for it means just so many more executive units to be watched,\r\njust so many more standards of road construction, just so many more\r\nindependent road plans.\r\n\r\nThe “business” end of county road administration is often weighted\r\ndown to earth with the same sublime faith in the wisdom of the average\r\ncitizen. Rarely have counties maintained anything that approximated\r\nadequate records of cost or serviceability of their roads and bridges\r\nor data upon which they could construct a satisfactory policy of\r\nconstruction, if indeed their governing bodies have dreamed of the need\r\nor the value of such aids. Even of so highly developed a community as\r\nMonroe County, New York, in which the City of Rochester is situated,\r\nit could be said concerning the office of highway superintendent that\r\n“the only record now kept is a bill book in which are entered all\r\nclaims against the county highway fund which are paid through the\r\nsuperintendent’s office, all payrolls and all claims for personal\r\nservice.”[12]\r\n\r\nMuch the same lack of appreciation for facts was revealed in a cruder\r\nway in a grand jury investigation during 1912 of the methods of the\r\nBoard of Commissioners in Darke County, Ohio, where it was discovered\r\nthat minutes were rarely read and contracts were voted twenty at a time\r\nand sometimes without the formality of a vote, in direct violation of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nFrom another middle western state comes an illuminating description\r\nof the method of awarding bids on bridge construction: “Each\r\ncompetitor submitted his own drawings and an estimate to a board of\r\ncommissioners, not one of whom had the least technical knowledge or\r\npractical experience, but was ‘led away’ generally _by the size of\r\nthe drawing_ and the accompanying estimate.\r\n\r\n“The result was shoddy work, insufficient piers or abutments, piles not\r\ndriven down to any safe and permanent depth and finally a bridge that\r\nwas built for appearance, not durability nor permanency. Just as soon\r\nas we had a flood bringing down logs, stumps and trees, some of these\r\nwould strike or swing against the piers and down came the structure,\r\nfloating away or lodging in the stream, causing a jamb to accumulate,\r\nholding up the stream and overflowing land for miles.\r\n\r\n“It took many years to get a system where an engineer designed a bridge\r\nwith details of construction, steel or iron cylinders filled with\r\nconcrete as piers, and a superintendent of construction who knew his\r\nbusiness to take charge of the work.\r\n\r\n“Thus we spent thousands of dollars for bridges to be erected simply\r\nto see them carried out; in one instance twice. But the cost and\r\nfailure combined in time brought forth such protests that such a system\r\nwould not be tolerated longer; but the waste was done and the money\r\npractically thrown away.\r\n\r\n“In county road repair and construction we were no better. The\r\ndistrict boss was elected politically, and of course he rewarded his\r\ncommissioner friends by working the road fund. He dared not complain\r\nof short hours or little done or sitting by the road discussing how\r\nto ‘fix the election,’ and usually the work was done just before the\r\nnomination and election. The ‘dump of dirt’ was left in a pile, not\r\neven leveled; every team avoided it if possible, and when winter then\r\ncame it was ‘slurry’ and mud. No ditches or outlets for same were made\r\nor cleaned out, and if any suggestion was made for improvement, you\r\nwere told ‘it was good enough before you came and you can get out if\r\nyou don’t want to stay.’”\r\n\r\nIn Polk County, Iowa, an investigation in 1912 disclosed the fact that\r\nthe board of supervisors had paid out $100,000 for contracts without\r\nasking for bids. They never required plans or specifications of any\r\nbridge to be constructed. Bridges had been ordered without any idea of\r\nwhat they would cost. No guarantee bond was required and bridges were\r\naccepted without inspection. Certain companies had been favored to the\r\nexclusion of others and the result was that in many counties bridges\r\nwere built at a cost fifty per cent. higher than their reasonable value.\r\n\r\nTo the rich opportunities for “turning an honest dollar” which lurked\r\nin such systems and in such an attitude on the part of the public\r\nofficers, the “powers that prey” have been keenly alive. The tale that\r\nwas told a few years ago, with a multitude of specifications, by a\r\nfew enterprising farm journals in the Middle West, rivals, except in\r\ndramatic quality and the size of the sums involved, the characteristic\r\nfalls from grace which have been heretofore associated with ward\r\naldermen and legislators hailing from wicked urban districts. It was a\r\nserious indictment of county officialdom which is contained in a letter\r\nof the chairman of the Roads and Highways Committee of the lower house\r\nin Kansas, who wrote in 1913:\r\n\r\n“I know there are comparatively few county commissioners who profit\r\npersonally by the manipulations of the bridge companies but the\r\nrepresentatives of the companies are shrewd men who understand\r\nthoroughly that the average county commissioner is very jealous of his\r\nbridge patronage, and brooks no interference with his handling of the\r\nbridge business with a free hand. Consequently the bridge men play this\r\nfeature to the limit and to their own profit.”[13]\r\n\r\nThat Iowa was inoculated with the same germ is suggested by remarks of\r\nAlson Secor, the editor of _Successful Farming_:\r\n\r\n“The bridge men are not depending upon a lobby at Des Moines, or any\r\nstate capitol, to put through what they want, or to prevent legislation\r\nthat will make bridge letting competitive. They work to elect or defeat\r\nsupervisors. They finance state supervisors’ annual meetings and give\r\nthe watchdogs of the public treasury that contains your tax money such\r\na good time that the ‘boys’ fall under lasting obligations to the\r\nbridge companies.\r\n\r\n“Bribe the lawmakers? Oh, no! You can’t say that. It isn’t a bribe\r\nto hand a man a line of soft talk, is it? It isn’t a bribe to give a\r\ncounty official a hilarious good time at a summer resort, is it? Or to\r\npay his hotel bills when he attends the state meetings? No--a thousand\r\ntimes no--legally.\r\n\r\n“But the bridge men get there just the same. They have for years\r\nprevented any legislation that would give them a dollar’s worth of\r\nbridge work for a dollar’s worth of taxes.”\r\n\r\nSo well satisfied were the favored bridge builders with the _status\r\nquo_ in Nebraska in 1913 that they are said to have maintained at\r\nthe state legislature a powerful lobby to oppose by corrupt methods a\r\nbill whose one purpose was to require bidders to furnish estimates on\r\nuniform blanks. The information thus obtained would have been placed\r\non file at the state capitol and made available to all who might wish\r\nto compare the cost of construction in different counties--light would\r\nhave been let into the operations of the counties in bridge-building\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that the _system_ did have much to do with\r\nwaste of public funds and inefficiency of every sort and was the basis\r\nof a certain amount of corruption, in all the states mentioned. It was\r\nnot all simply a matter of “good” men and “bad” men. But the breakdown\r\nof the county in highway affairs is fast becoming ancient history, not\r\ndirectly, through a process of regeneration, but through forces playing\r\nupon the county from without which we will again identify for the\r\npresent simply as the “good-roads” movement, of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n[12] From an unpublished report of the Rochester Bureau of Municipal\r\nResearch, 1915.\r\n\r\n[13] _Successful Farming_, June, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNULLIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery now and then we shall have to remind ourselves that the county\r\nmade the politician, rather than the other way round.\r\n\r\nAnd the county in its turn, is pretty well rooted in the good graces of\r\nhuman nature. When American counties had been formed and their legal\r\nstatus as subordinates of the state had been established, the people\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of each of the states were pretty\r\nmuch of one mind in the fundamental standards of personal conduct. A\r\ntradition of strict morality dominated New England. Its dominion was\r\nnot seriously questioned. The South and the middle states may not have\r\nbeen so strict but they were homogeneous in their own brand of morality.\r\n\r\nThen in due time two movements took place in the northern states.\r\nJust as the constitution follows the flag so the Puritan morality\r\n(more or less modulated and diluted) trailed the westward drift of New\r\nEngland population, first into New York, then into the Western Reserve\r\nand finally into the Middle West and Northwest. But another force\r\ncontended for mastery with the New England influence. The growth of\r\nthe cities and particularly of the factory centers was simultaneous\r\nwith the great waves of immigration from central and southern Europe.\r\nWith the new immigration came a conflicting standard of morality. The\r\nGerman and southern European immigrants particularly, brought with\r\nthem liberal ideas of Sabbath observance. They also loved their beer\r\nand red wine. In time they upset the moral balance of the cities,\r\ncoming into sharp collision with the New England (we might also say,\r\nAmerican) conception of the Sabbath and with the total abstinence idea\r\nwhich began to get a firm foothold in the nineteenth century. This\r\ncomplex influence gave us the setting for at least one phase of that\r\nnever-ending feud that rages between New York City and “up-state.”\r\nIt pitted Chicago against rural Illinois. It made Cincinnati a more\r\nor less alien city in Ohio. It gave us a permanent body of citizens\r\nwho resent having their conduct dictated (as they apparently view it)\r\nfrom above. Preponderantly foreign in their origin, they are loud in\r\ntheir proclamation of their rights as American citizens, while the\r\nNew England element, still most influential on the whole in the rural\r\ndistricts, is properly horrified at the low estate of virtue in the\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that this clash of interests should be reflected\r\nin politics. Our curiously illogical state system lent itself most\r\nobligingly, if albeit rather ludicrously, to a compromise; the New\r\nEngland conscience should get the necessary laws and the “foreign\r\nelement,” where its political force predominated, should control their\r\nenforcement! The state of Illinois has carried on its statute books\r\na law requiring the closing of saloons on Sundays, which applies\r\nuniformly throughout the state. Never till recently was a serious\r\nattempt made to enforce it in the city of Chicago, which was quite in\r\naccordance with the _modus vivendi_. Then, in 1915, a new mayor\r\ntook it into his head to close the saloons up tight. On a bright Sunday\r\nafternoon the populace, thirsty and indignant, turned out and demanded\r\ntheir American rights. The mayor’s attitude came from reading the law\r\nliterally but without a due regard to the great body of voters who are\r\n“for the law but ‘agin’ its enforcement.”\r\n\r\nThe state system regularly provides against such mistakes of official\r\njudgment by carefully divorcing the _duty_ to enforce from the\r\n_incentive_ to enforce. The New York laws forbid the placing of\r\nwagers on horse races. They stand there presumably as a monument to\r\nthe enlightened conscience of a majority of the people. They were\r\nnot enacted as an expression of moral sentimentality to be ignored\r\nat will, but as an instruction for the governor, the administrative\r\nestablishment of the state and the courts to carry out. The statute\r\nis of course obeyed in all counties where there are no race tracks\r\nand no facilities for placing bets! But in the other counties? The\r\nlegislature has provided no means of execution other than the locally\r\ncontrolled peace officers, the sheriffs and the constables. These are\r\nthe servants of the state, to be sure, and they are sworn to protect\r\nits laws. But in a more direct human way they are of the county, bound\r\nto the local hotel keepers, the local retail merchants and the jitney\r\nbus owners whose business thrives on the patronage of the race-track\r\ncrowd. Local public opinion in the race-track district flouts the will\r\nof the people of the state and it says to the state, as President\r\nJackson said to the Supreme Court, “You have made your decision; now\r\nenforce it.”\r\n\r\nOnly occasionally does moral sentiment run strong enough to force\r\nthe governor to be in fact as well as in theory the real head of the\r\nstate in the sense that he employs state instruments to enforce state\r\ndesires. Such an incident occurred a few years ago when the governor of\r\nIndiana was compelled to order out the militia to enforce a law against\r\nrace-track gambling because he had no power to compel the elective\r\nsheriff or other local officers to do their duty.\r\n\r\nIn practical politics this clash of moral standards produces not\r\nonly the anomalous situation referred to but often the strictly\r\nadministrative matter of law enforcement is consciously and designedly\r\na political issue. The popular desire to graduate or temper the\r\nenforcement of the law is doubtless the real secret of interest which\r\nso often centers in the election of a district attorney. Shall we have\r\na “liberal” administration or shall we “clap on the lid,” that is\r\nabout the form the question takes--euphony for: “Shall the prosecutor\r\nshut his eyes and ignore the law, or shall he obey it according to\r\nhis official oath?” The liberal candidate goes before the people with\r\npromises to go easy and the strict morality candidate to make the way\r\nof the transgressor hard.\r\n\r\nWhich is right? For the present it matters little. It remains simply to\r\npoint out that since the organization of the state and county provides\r\nno organ of expression for local policy, the people in their infinite\r\ncapacity to adapt themselves to a hard condition proceed to make a\r\npolicy-determining body out of a strictly administrative officer, like\r\nthe district attorney or the sheriff.\r\n\r\nNullification shows itself also in the administration of the tax law.\r\nMost of the states derive a portion of their revenues from the general\r\nproperty tax. But the power of taxation lies in the legislature and\r\nno state has its own local agents directly and fully responsible to\r\na central authority for fixing the valuations upon which the levy\r\nis based. The county (except where state revenues are derived from\r\ndistinct sources) is required to contribute its proportionate share to\r\nthe central treasury and is left to do the right thing by the state,\r\nwith such supervision as will be hereafter noted. The people of the\r\ncounty are allowed to select their own assessors, on the theory that a\r\nman on the ground knows valuations better than any outside impartial\r\nperson and that no one is more competent to select such a man than his\r\nown neighbors.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happens, just as in the case of the sheriffs, that the local\r\ntax officers are confronted with conflicting obligations. They must\r\ntake their choice, on the one hand, between strict observance of the\r\nlaw and unpopularity, with the probable loss of their jobs at the end\r\nof their term, and popularity with prospects of possible political\r\nadvancement and a more or less assured living, on the other. Inasmuch\r\nas there is never any question as to which of these courses is the\r\nmore practical and immediately profitable, the tax assessors of the\r\ncounty invariably find it infinitely to their personal advantage to\r\nserve the locality that pays their salaries. Assessors in the sister\r\ncounties do likewise; with the ultimate result that general competition\r\narises among the counties as to which shall value property lowest and\r\nthus pay the smallest proportion of the state’s tax. The system is\r\nideally designed to reward dishonesty and perjury and punish faithful\r\nobedience to the law. For, as a former New York State Tax Commissioner\r\nhas said, “Under assessment is the rule throughout the state, and in\r\nnearly all the tax districts intentionally and purposely so.” The range\r\nof these assessments is well known to be anywhere between twenty-five\r\nand ninety per cent. of the full value of the property. And the\r\nassessors “make their own laws as to the basis of assessing property,\r\nin deliberate violation of the statutes and then proceed to make oath\r\nto the assessment rule that they have assessed all property at its full\r\nvalue.” That what is true of New York is equally true of most other\r\nstates where an analogous system prevails, is the testimony of tax\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThese frailties of human nature the states have weakly connived at by\r\nthe provisions they have made for equalization of assessments. It is\r\nthe old story of reform via complication and, as one county attorney in\r\nNew York has testified, “equalization in this state is an abomination,\r\na joke, a cover for deals and trades, a means of purchase and sale,\r\nin its results most unfair and unjust, based on the assumption of\r\naccomplished perjury, in itself a chief cause of the perjury.” A\r\nMissouri authority corroborates by remarking:\r\n\r\n “The county board of equalization ... does little to improve the\r\n situation as it is affected by the same conditions which influence\r\n the acts of the assessor. Much the same is true of the state board\r\n of equalization which consists of the Governor, Secretary of State,\r\n State Auditor, State Treasurer and Attorney-General. This board has\r\n authority to equalize assessments among the counties, but not among\r\n different persons or property within the county. The officials who\r\n make up this board have neither the time, information nor powers to\r\n adequately correct the evils. _Political considerations also affect\r\n the solution of the problems._”\r\n\r\nBut the way to a sincere and logical system is not easy. Popular\r\nsentiment seems to favor the _status quo_. For the first time in\r\nthe history of this country, Governor Cox of Ohio in 1913 persuaded\r\nthe legislature to establish a unified plan of organization for local\r\nassessment. Inasmuch as taxation is the prerogative of the state\r\ngovernment, he proposed a system of tax assessment which would have\r\nmade this idea an actual as well as a legal fact. The law would have\r\nabolished the locally elected assessor in the counties. Full control\r\nwould have been placed in the hands of the state government, since\r\nthe Governor would appoint the local officials. There would probably,\r\nin the nature of things, have been an end to log-rolling and to\r\ncompetition between the counties to “beat” the state. The law was\r\npassed, but it was so unpopular that Governor Cox’s opponent in the\r\nsucceeding election used it for political capital. One of the earliest\r\nand proudest achievements of his administration was the repeal of this\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAnd so our old friend the “average citizen” finds it often acceptable\r\nto have a county government that is not built in strict conformance\r\nwith logic. It is a complicated mechanism to be sure, but what matter,\r\nif he can employ a chauffeur to run it? To meet just such specific\r\ndemands as this the professional politician and his illogical system\r\nhave arisen and continue to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSTATE MEDDLING\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the other side of the story.\r\n\r\nWhile the county nonchalantly and with seeming impunity has been\r\nbreaking all the inconvenient statutes, the state in its own peculiar\r\nway has been working out a method of “taking it out” of the county\r\nfor the indignities of nullification. The state’s “big stick” (which\r\nit does not always employ to a public purpose) is a policy of\r\nmeddlesomeness which expresses itself through special legislation. Of\r\nwhich, more herewith.\r\n\r\nIn times gone by, when counties were almost universally located in\r\nthe open country, and before the rush for the cities had set apart\r\ncenters of population which developed their special mechanism of local\r\ngovernment, it was doubtless appropriate that constitutions should\r\nimpose upon legislature the duty to legislate “uniformly” for all\r\ncounties, even to the point of anticipating some of their more detailed\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nPractically every state legislature was given a considerable, if not\r\ncomplete, power to bend the county to its will in every particular of\r\ngovernment. In the logic of the law, the county was a subdivision of\r\nthe state before it was an organ of strictly local government. The\r\nlegislature might erect new counties or change boundary lines at will,\r\nwith the one limitation in some states that its decision is subject to\r\na local referendum. It might also erect new county offices in addition\r\nto those mentioned in the constitution and fix their powers and duties.\r\nLong ago it became the accepted principle of law that local authorities\r\nmight exercise only such powers as were specifically conferred upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe theory was, apparently, that since counties exist to execute the\r\nwill of the whole state and have the same general duties to perform,\r\nall counties can and must perform them in the same manner. It is a\r\nplausible theory. If a county is to administer justice it needs a\r\njudge, a sheriff, a prosecutor and a court clerk. And each of these\r\nofficers in the several counties should follow as closely as possible\r\nan identical or similar procedure. Every county must have a fiscal\r\nagency, a governing board, and be required to observe certain minimum\r\nstandards in the handling of the funds entrusted to its care.\r\n\r\nUniformity up to this point is doubtless not burdensome but helpful.\r\nBut by carrying a good idea too far the legislatures have often gone\r\nbeyond the point of setting up a general organization and procedure\r\nand have descended into minor details which would usually best be\r\ndetermined in the light of the more perfect knowledge of local\r\nconditions which the people of the locality may be expected to possess.\r\n\r\nThe New York legislature, for instance, has accepted the inertia of\r\nlong-standing custom and permitted to stand on the statutes a county\r\nlaw under which the boards of supervisors in all counties, except those\r\nof New York City, are organized in precisely the same manner. No regard\r\nfor the far-reaching historic shifts of population; no thought as to\r\nhow deeply the social and political unity of a particular county may\r\nhave been shattered by the growth of great cities in the midst of apple\r\norchards or grain fields. The law has passively assumed that voters\r\nare voters (just as “business is business” and “pigs is pigs”) whether\r\nthey reside in a crowded city or sparsely settled countryside where\r\neverybody knows everybody else’s business and has plenty of time to\r\nplay politics.\r\n\r\nAnd so it turns out that Erie County, containing the city of Buffalo,\r\nwith its half million inhabitants surrounded by a farming district,\r\nis equipped with the same general form of government as the rough and\r\nsparsely settled counties of Warren and Essex in the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nIn other states, for Buffalo substitute Cleveland, or Chicago or\r\nMilwaukee--great cities unequally yoked with an agricultural population\r\nof divergent interests.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable under the circumstances that the states through their\r\nlegislatures should do a good deal of polite nullifying on their own\r\naccount. The provisions of the constitutions relating to legislative\r\npowers over counties, instead of being strictly construed have\r\ningeniously circumvented. What some legislatures could do in defiance\r\nof good political science but yet without legal evasion the California,\r\nNew Jersey and other legislatures have accomplished by stretching the\r\nmeaning “general” or “uniform.”\r\n\r\nTake the California practice. In the words of the constitution the\r\nlegislature is required to establish “a system of county government\r\nwhich shall be uniform throughout the state.” But it happens that\r\nthese counties range in population from a few hundred to over half a\r\nmillion, and in area from 755 to 23,000 square miles. Some are strictly\r\nrural, while, at the other extreme, is one geographically identical\r\nwith the city of San Francisco. All sorts of combinations of urban\r\nand rural conditions intervene. Some of the territory is traversed by\r\nsteam railroads and trolley lines and some of it is inaccessible to a\r\nstage coach. But all of it is “uniformly” governed. Inasmuch as the\r\nlegislature never could bring itself to withhold its hand from the\r\nminute details of county business, it had to find a way to “beat” the\r\nconstitution. It placed each of the fifty-six counties in a separate\r\nclass, and passed fifty-six “general” laws, each applying in fact to a\r\nsingle county, but not mentioning the county by name!\r\n\r\nIn Illinois the habit of special legislation has led the Bureau of\r\nPublic Efficiency to remark that: “The General Assembly of Illinois\r\nmight with propriety be added to the list of nineteen local governing\r\nbodies of Cook County, for it is continually interfering in an\r\narbitrary manner in matters of local administration.”\r\n\r\nNew Jersey has sinned quite as grievously and its courts have\r\nconsistently upheld the act even against a provision of the\r\nconstitution which expressly prohibits the legislature from “regulating\r\nthe internal affairs of towns and counties.”\r\n\r\nBut lest the full import of these statements should be lost, the\r\nfollowing titles of special county bills in a single session of a New\r\nYork legislature, are cited in evidence:\r\n\r\nAuthorizing conveyance of land on Holland Avenue.\r\n\r\nStriking out the provision authorizing county treasurer to appoint an\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nRegulating tax collection procedure.\r\n\r\nFixing compensation of unskilled laborers.\r\n\r\nCorrecting 1915 tax roll.\r\n\r\nCreating a county auditor.\r\n\r\nIncreasing salary of sheriff, etc.\r\n\r\nLevy of taxes to meet cost of sanitary trunk sewer.\r\n\r\nRegulating management of penitentiary and workhouse.\r\n\r\nCreating commissioner of charities.\r\n\r\nToo often the motive of the legislators has not been to make the\r\ncounty the state’s more obedient servant, but to “bleed” it to the\r\nutmost for political purposes. Back of the real difficulties of\r\nadjusting the state’s responsibilities to the idea of local control\r\nover administrative details, is too evident the suspicion that the\r\npolitical machine needs the county very much “in its business.”\r\n\r\nFor this reason, doubtless, special legislation affecting counties\r\nis so often inseparably associated with the forcible opening of\r\nthe county treasury. New York City in recent years has suffered\r\ngrievously from mandatory salary increases, imposed in many cases by\r\na party of the opposite political faith from the one in control over\r\nthe local budget. Thus in 1915 out of a total budget allowance of\r\n$7,003,716.82 for county purposes, the sum of $4,858,773.47 or 69.1\r\nper cent. represented mandatory appropriations which could not be\r\nincreased or diminished by the local budget makers either because the\r\nexact amount was fixed by law or because the power of fixation was\r\nconferred upon other officers than the appropriating body of the city.\r\nMany of the measures in question dealt with the salaries of clerks,\r\nstenographers and messengers. Of the total allowance in the same year\r\nfor personal services (salaries, etc.) of $5,809,481.75, 78 per cent.\r\nor $4,576,985.75 was beyond local control. While by far the greater\r\nproportion of these sums were just and necessary, the margin of waste\r\nwhich represented one hundred per cent. politics, was, without a\r\ndoubt, exceedingly large.\r\n\r\nNor have the legislatures been led to take this course for reasons of\r\npublic economy. In thus appropriating other people’s money according\r\nto its professedly superior knowledge of the state’s needs, it does\r\nnot often appear to give heed to standards of experience or of service\r\nrendered. Often it is but the old story of the influences back of the\r\nbill with this title: “An Act, providing for the appointment by the\r\nsheriff of ---- County, of an undersheriff, fireman and court officers,\r\nand for their compensation and duties.” When the truth came out it\r\nappeared that the sheriff and the board of supervisors were of opposite\r\nparties. The sheriff (whether rightly or wrongly) was not to be put\r\naside. He simply appealed over the heads of his “superiors” to a higher\r\nauthority for what he wanted--and got it. The people had elected a\r\nBoard of Supervisors, to manage the county finances, but at the moment\r\nwhen this body might have effected a just economy, it was forcibly\r\nstripped of their powers.\r\n\r\nTheoretically the legislature in the case cited intervened, but what\r\nprobably happened was that someone saw the representative in the\r\nlegislature from the county in question and he “fixed” it with the\r\nproper committee. The speaker let the bill go through on the floor of\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the local politician or petty officeholder who\r\nis looking for special privilege, via the back-door method, and of\r\nthe home legislator who does the “fixing,” special legislation is thus\r\ndoubtless a benevolent privilege which enables men to put various local\r\npeople in their debt for future purposes. For the “organization” of\r\nthe dominant party, the power to give to or withhold from the local\r\nmunicipalities is often not the least important element of its power.\r\n\r\nAs for the county, for its sins of nullification it would seem to be\r\nappropriately penalized, particularly if it belongs in the metropolitan\r\nclass. It has been placed under a sort of patriarchal discipline,\r\nrobbed of much of its individuality and initiative; its responsible\r\nofficers subjected to humiliation from subordinates; its resources\r\ndiverted to partisan uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSTATE GUIDANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point the indictment of the county ceases. It is not an\r\naltogether hopeless situation. The very thoroughness of the county’s\r\nfailure is the chief promise of ultimate redemption.\r\n\r\nNot because the county is constructed on an unsound political theory,\r\nnot because it has shocked the sense of humanity, but because of its\r\nriotous misuse of public funds, it has begun to attract the attention\r\nof higher authorities.\r\n\r\nWhere does the county’s money go? It has been strongly intimated in\r\nprevious chapters that the citizens of the county and sometimes even\r\nthe county officers know little and care less. Is it economically run?\r\nNo one can easily tell, without knowing what other county governments\r\nare costing, service for service and unit for unit. And no one can make\r\nsuch a comparison between counties unless they have some common basis\r\nof understanding. To establish standards in the use of terms, to make\r\nin other words, each county tell its financial story in a language\r\nunderstood throughout the state, to bring the information from the\r\nvarious counties together for comparison, to insist upon a sufficiently\r\ndetailed description of financial activities, is the object of uniform\r\nreporting.\r\n\r\nAnd who can force such a coming together for a common understanding\r\nother than the state itself?\r\n\r\nAmong the states where county government is of appreciable importance,\r\nOhio was the pioneer in the direction indicated by this suggestion.\r\nThe law enacted in that state in 1902 approached the county problem\r\nwith the conviction that what was needed above all else was more\r\nlight--in an administrative sense; that when the shortcomings of county\r\ngovernment could be reduced to statistics and comparisons (invidious\r\nif necessary) could be made between various units, then some real\r\nimprovements might be reasonably expected. Provision was made in the\r\nenactment for a state Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public\r\nOffices which should install a uniform system of public accounting,\r\nauditing and reporting in every office in the state. A corps of field\r\nagents known as state examiners were employed on a civil service basis\r\nto make personal examinations in each of the taxing districts. The\r\nfindings of the examiners are published, and if money is due the county\r\nthe enforcement of the law is left first to the county prosecuting\r\nattorney and then to the attorney general.\r\n\r\nNew York followed the lead of Ohio by passing in 1905 a law which\r\nrequires counties, villages and cities, to report annually to the\r\ncomptroller on forms prescribed by him.\r\n\r\n“Indiana and Ohio,” says Professor John A. Boyle,[14] “has gone\r\ninto the science and art of uniform accounting very seriously and\r\nvery effectively. The Indiana law (1909, ch. 55, amended March 3,\r\n1911), creates a Department of Inspection and Supervision of Public\r\nOffices having jurisdiction over every public office in the state.\r\nThe administration of the law was entrusted at the outset to one\r\nstate examiner, two deputies, one clerk, and fifty-two field agents\r\nworking on a civil service basis. Uniform accounting is prescribed and\r\ninstalled. Comparative statistics are compiled by the state examiner\r\nand published annually, so that the fruits of this department are\r\navailable to the public.”\r\n\r\nWyoming has a fair system of audit.\r\n\r\nThe North Dakota law, while it requires the state examiner “to\r\nprescribe and enforce correct methods,” does not call for a uniform\r\nsystem. Massachusetts, Kansas, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, Florida,\r\nTennessee, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Washington,\r\nMinnesota, West Virginia, Louisiana, California and Michigan have\r\nmore or less complete systems of state financial supervision. The\r\n“black sheep” among the states in this respect are Alabama, Arkansas,\r\nDelaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri,\r\nNew Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas,\r\nUtah, Vermont and Virginia.\r\n\r\nNow for the results of this supervision.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boyle has summed up the sort of assistance that the state\r\nbureaus of accounting have been able to give. One instance of such help\r\nis that where county officers had been accustomed in the past to take\r\nlong and expensive junkets to inspect public buildings, expert advice\r\nunder the new system has been rendered to them in much cheaper form\r\nthrough the investigators of the state. Examiners have also been able\r\nto point out to county officers many deviations from the letter of the\r\nlaw, the strict compliance with which is of the most vital importance\r\nin the performance of certain county functions, such as taxation.\r\nIn a similar way they have checked up illegal charges against the\r\ncounty, inadequate audit (or no audit at all), instances of additional\r\ncompensation (under various guises) for personal service, illegal\r\ntemporary loans and misapplication of funds.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be seen that the mere possibility of a state examiner’s\r\nvisit will have an admonitory effect which in itself will often be\r\nsufficient to keep an official in the straight and narrow path. The\r\ncounty, in conforming to the reporting requirements, derives a local\r\nbenefit wholly apart from any obligation to the state. Upon the basis\r\nof a sound and permanent system of accounting the local officers are\r\nin a position accurately to inform the county of their doings and\r\nmake comparison of a financial transaction of one year with those of\r\nprevious years. Herein is one foundation stone of a scientific budget.\r\n\r\nUnder a complete system of state regulation not only are the forms and\r\nstandards of uniform accounting established, but a staff of expert\r\nexaminers is created to determine by periodical investigation, whether\r\nor not these standards are lived up to.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable conditions preceding the establishment of the Ohio\r\nBureau and the important services which it has rendered the state,\r\nare revealed in the following summary[15] of its findings in counties\r\nduring the first ten years of its existence.\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF FINDINGS TO NOVEMBER 15, 1912\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES\r\n\r\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------\r\n      | Findings for|  Illegal  | Unclaimed |    Total    |\r\n Year |   Recovery  |  Payments |  Moneys   |   Illegal   |  Returns\r\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------\r\n 1903 |   $50,268.93| $18,808.91|    $807.92|   $69,884.76| $10,741.93\r\n 1904 |    57,805.54|   2,504.41|  10,339.95|    70,649.90|   2,222.31\r\n 1905 |   246,280.58|   7,421.87|  25,389.52|   279,091.97|  24,847.83\r\n      |             |           |           |             |\r\n 1906 |   295,082.80|  14,227.52|   5,218.21|   314,528.53| 232,156.78\r\n 1907 |   646,397.50| 115,906.91|  18,049.13|   780,353.54| 322,911.08\r\n 1908 |   103,764.26|  43,333.31|   9,829.15|   156,928.92|  41,171.53\r\n      |             |           |           |             |\r\n 1909 |   410,282.51| 320,137.17|  23,219.42|   753,639.10|  66,219.91\r\n 1910 |   146,024.04| 106,410.00|  22,241.18|   274,675.22|  24,438.36\r\n 1911 |   233,547.24| 129,007.02|   7,921.90|   370,476.16|  37,735.34\r\n      |             |           |           |             |\r\n 1912 |   112,926.80| No report |     118.26|   113,045.06|  96,015.16\r\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------\r\n Ttls |$2,302,379.30|$757,759.32|$123,134.54|$3,183,273.16|$858,460.23\r\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTAX ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nA branch of local fiscal administration which is in far less\r\nsatisfactory shape is that of taxation. In no department is\r\n“nullification,” as has been already shown, more constant and\r\nserious. The situation is complicated. In seventeen of the states,\r\nincluding every one north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers, and east of\r\nthe Mississippi, except Illinois, Indiana and Maryland, the county\r\nas a whole has very little to do with assessments for the general\r\nproperty tax, the unit for assessment in that section being the town\r\nor township. That in nearly all these states the general property tax\r\nmay be said to have broken down, would seem to be indicated by the\r\nestablishment of a permanent state tax commission or commissioner in\r\nall of them except Pennsylvania. In thirty-one states in the South and\r\nWest, the county is the unit of assessment, and in its favor it may be\r\nsaid that in this rôle it has proven a far more satisfactory performer\r\nthan the town. The county is small enough to serve as a convenient\r\nunit for assessment operations and assessment records and furnishes\r\nthe basis of a system of fewer units than if the town were the basis.\r\nUnder the county plan, moreover, there are fewer opportunities for\r\ncommunities to compete against each other in their effort to escape\r\ntheir just share of the general burden of government. It is significant\r\nthat most of the western states have seen the advantages of the county\r\nas the local unit of administration.\r\n\r\nBut the county, for all that, appears to be incapable of standing\r\non its own feet in tax matters. Even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances there remains an important duty for a state commission to\r\nsupervise the work of the county assessor or board of assessors to the\r\nend that the letter of the law may be obeyed with the utmost uniformity\r\nthroughout the state. Such a commission must see that the county\r\ndoes injustice to neither individuals nor the state through inequal\r\nassessment and that the tax sales are in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nThe county, in short, has a useful place in the general scheme of tax\r\nadministration, but it must be a _supervised_ unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the civil service law the county also does\r\nwell to lean upon the state. The same considerations that apply in\r\naccounting and tax matters apply with equal force in the selection of\r\nthe employees. Most of the counties are too small to serve as units in\r\nwhich to install facilities for conducting examinations and publishing\r\nuseful records. The superior powers of the state commission over\r\nthe localities in these respects are emphatically not a destructive\r\ncheck upon the county’s officers. They do not detract from local\r\nresponsibility. They simply enable them to apply to their work the\r\nmost effective means available.\r\n\r\nIn New York the state civil service commission regulates the service in\r\neighteen counties. In New Jersey the adoption of the civil service law\r\ninvolving state control rests with the people of each county. Hudson,\r\nEssex, Mercer, Passaic and Union counties have taken advantage of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAdministration apart from fiscal supervision in other departments,\r\nsuch as charities, prisons and public health, has advanced much more\r\nslowly than reform in the fields which have been mentioned. But every\r\nindication for the future is toward greater control through accounting\r\nand supervision. The county acts locally in the enforcement of state\r\nobligations. The real trouble comes when one undertakes, arbitrarily,\r\nto place any given county activity in the local or state category.\r\nThe catching of a thief, for example, is a very essential part of the\r\nstate’s most fundamental duty to protect property, but the locality\r\nwhere the crime is committed is very keenly interested in having the\r\nmachinery of the county set to work to punish the deed. The locality\r\npays the sheriff his salary or his fees, but the state, in protecting\r\nthe property of its citizens, is probably justified in guarding against\r\nextravagant or dishonest use by the people of the county even of their\r\nown money.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is impracticable and not by any means necessary to give the\r\ncounty quite unbridled liberty to control all its officers. Central\r\nsupervision is a middle course that protects the state and instead of\r\nimpairing, really conserves the county’s interests. The state, without\r\ninstructing the county as to _what_ it may do with its purely\r\nlocal powers, may lay a firm hand upon it in telling _how_ to\r\nuse those powers effectively. Such a course is conceived in quite a\r\ndifferent spirit from the destructive sort of state meddling which was\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter, which proceeds from the legislative\r\nbranch of the central government. What the state government actually\r\ndoes when it regulates or supervises is to hold up the county official\r\nto standards of performance. This is the proper work of officers or\r\nboards in the administrative branch. It relates not to _what_\r\nthe county shall do as a matter of broad policy, but _how_ the\r\ncounty shall redeem its obligation in matters of routine, detail and\r\ntechnique. The state agency may have only the power to “visit and\r\ninspect,” like the New York State Board of Charities, or it may, like\r\nthe Comptroller of the same state, actually impose forms of procedure.\r\nIn either case, local officers otherwise unstimulated to efficient\r\nwork, as they must be under the present system of government, are thus\r\ngiven moral support from a responsible quarter. They are subjected to\r\na cold, unescapable comparison with other officers in other localities\r\nand they are given the benefit of expert advice on many obscure and\r\ncomplex phases of public administration.\r\n\r\n[14] See _Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social\r\nScience_, May 1913. pp. 199-213.\r\n\r\n[15] Prof. John H. Boyle, _op. cit._, p. 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nREADJUSTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much by way of accepting counties as they are. “State guidance” goes\r\na long way as a palliative of unsatisfactory conditions. It is a sort\r\nof permanent first aid to the injured.\r\n\r\nBut the county needs surgical treatment! In some cases it is well to\r\n_fix_ responsibility. In extremities it becomes necessary to\r\n_amputate_.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, to begin with, the fact that the county at bottom is\r\nreally a piece of the state, a local agency. The prevailing practice\r\nof local election of officers and its logical sequence, local\r\nnullification, have done much to obscure the real interests of the\r\nstate at the county court house, till the average run of citizens have\r\nlong forgotten that the distinction exists; that officers like the\r\nsheriff, district attorney, public administrator and coroner are not\r\nstrictly local officers at all but subordinates of the general state\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important branch of general administration with\r\nwhich county officers serve is the judiciary. Counties, except in a\r\nfew states, are the units for selection of judges having original\r\njurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases which involve moderate\r\namounts of money and less than the most serious offenses. With the\r\ncounty court also is generally associated probate jurisdiction, which\r\nis exercised in some of the eastern states by a special officer known\r\nas the surrogate, who may be a judge as in New York, or a purely\r\nministerial officer, as in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nLegally the judiciary is more nearly a part of a state system than any\r\nother branch of the county organization. The decisions of the judges\r\nare of course subject to appeal to a higher state court--that is an\r\nimportant form of control. Sometimes, as in California, a part of the\r\nsalary of the county judge is paid from state funds. Probably too the\r\ngreater popular respect that hedges about the bench is sufficient to\r\nset it apart from much of the sinister influence that often affects\r\nthe other officers of the county. Nevertheless, the county court in\r\ncommon with other divisions of the judiciary, is subject to a wide\r\nvariety of disintegrating forces. It has a variegated allegiance: to\r\nthe people (in most of the states) for its original selection, to the\r\ncounty governing body for many incidental items of financial support,\r\nand to higher judicial authority for confirmation or revision of its\r\ndecisions. It does not control its executive agents, such as the\r\nsheriff and the county clerk, who are usually independent elective\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe readjustment of this situation can hardly be effected\r\nsatisfactorily apart from a complete reorganization of the state’s\r\njudicial system. This will undoubtedly involve, among other things, a\r\nmuch more complete central control on the part of a state chief justice\r\nand a judicial council. The courts must be organized with a keener\r\nappreciation that a judge in rendering just and learned decisions is a\r\npart of a business machine--he is waiting on customers; that there is\r\nno sound reason why the judicial department should defy the principle\r\nof responsibility any more than a department which serves the public in\r\nanother way.\r\n\r\nIn the general overhauling of the systems, perhaps the elective county\r\njudge will disappear. But liberty, for all that, will not vanish from\r\nthe earth. States as diverse in their location and composition as New\r\nHampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey and South Carolina never drifted\r\nquite completely into the habit of “electing everybody,” and they are\r\ngood states. The Federal judiciary, too, is appointive, and it is\r\nnot more culpable, by standards of either the progressiveness or of\r\nadministrative efficiency, than most of the state courts.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake, we may hope, will also shake up the justices of the\r\npeace, who in any self-respecting organization of the courts will\r\neither disappear or be linked up, as the American Judicature Society\r\nproposes, in a county system, with the county judge in control. The\r\njustices are now associated with the town or a corresponding division\r\nof the county and deal with very minor (but not for that reason\r\ninsignificant) civil and criminal cases, or act as a tribunal for\r\npreliminary hearings and commitments. In cities the office has steadily\r\nand hopelessly decayed by transfer of its jurisdiction to other courts\r\nand through the abuses of the fee system. It was established moreover\r\nwhen means of transportation were few and difficult and districts\r\nconsequently had to be made small in order to meet the convenience\r\nof the litigants who came seeking justice. But times have changed!\r\nCircumstances favor larger districts and infinitely better control over\r\nthis branch of the judiciary.\r\n\r\nIn making over the courts we cannot properly overlook the machinery\r\nfor enforcing judicial decisions. This is the function of the sheriff.\r\nWhere, in the reconstructed scheme of things shall he come in? Our\r\nforefathers committed themselves to the theory of the separation of\r\npowers, these three: the legislative, the executive and the judicial.\r\nUnder this scheme of things the duty of judges is to find or interpret\r\nthe law: nothing more. The sheriff as an executive officer is therefore\r\nalways independent of the court: he is the enforcer of state laws which\r\ncome to him in the form of very specific instructions by way of court\r\ndecisions. Such instructions are issued in the interest of parties to a\r\nlegal controversy.\r\n\r\nBut the sheriff is not the only law enforcer in the county. The state\r\nhas made the board of supervisors (or board of commissioners) and\r\ncounty officers its agents in enforcing various state laws. And so\r\nthe question arises: why not bring all the enforcing agencies under a\r\nsingle control? Two ways suggest themselves. If the judicial system is\r\nto be a unified state affair, then judicial-decision enforcing should\r\nalso be a state concern and the county should keep its hands off. In\r\npractice this would mean that the governor or some other general state\r\nofficer should appoint the sheriffs on the same principle which is\r\nemployed in the federal government, wherein the President appoints U.\r\nS. marshals. But, if on the other hand, the county government is to be\r\nconsidered as a general local agency of the state for enforcing all its\r\nlaws, then nothing remains but to put it up to the local governing body\r\nor some local chief executive to select the sheriff. Such is the method\r\nwhich has been applied in the city and county of Denver, Colorado,\r\nwhere the mayor is the chief executive of the consolidated governments.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the coroner? Every authority worthy of credence is agreed\r\nthat this office, above all others in the county, has long outlived its\r\nusefulness. That one small head should contain the necessary skill of\r\ncriminal investigator, medical expert and magistrate is far too much to\r\nexpect of any ordinary mortal. A few states, following Massachusetts,\r\nwhich abolished the coronership in 1877, have created an office under\r\nvarious titles, such as “medical examiner,” “county physician” (New\r\nJersey), “medical referee” (New Hampshire), etc. They have modernized\r\nthe coronership by stripping it of its magisterial powers and taking\r\nit off the ballot. In most cases the new medical officer is an expert\r\npathologist and his services are often of the greatest value in\r\ncriminal and civil actions and to the cause of science. In New York\r\nCity the coroners now in office in the five boroughs will go out of\r\noffice on January 1, 1918, their powers of investigation will then\r\nbe transferred to a chief medical examiner appointed by the mayor,\r\nand a corps of assistants who will be equipped with ample laboratory\r\nfacilities. The judicial duties of the coroner will be turned over to\r\nthe city magistrates.\r\n\r\nAs for the district attorney,[16] his proper relations to a criminal\r\ntrial and to the public seem to be generally misunderstood. He is the\r\nstate’s advocate as against the breaker of the law. But it is no part\r\nof his business to send every alleged offender to the penitentiary.\r\nThe efficiency of the prosecutor is not to be determined by a high\r\nrecord of convictions. He is not, properly, a man-hunter. Nor is it his\r\nprovince to decide when he shall bear down hard upon offenders and when\r\nhe shall soften justice. His functions, in short, are administrative\r\nand not political. And when that fact is admitted every reason why he\r\nshould be popularly elected falls. In the ideal county, efficiency in\r\nthe administration of justice will not be a perennial local campaign\r\nissue, for the prosecutor will be appointed by some responsible state\r\nauthority, such as the governor or attorney general, not as a reward\r\nfor political services but on the basis of merit and fitness. Or if,\r\nperchance, it shall be deemed unwise so to centralize authority,\r\nit would at least be logical to let the county authorities do the\r\nappointing.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be disposed of the clerk of court.[17] His relation\r\nto the bench is rather a closer one than that of the sheriff, so close\r\nthat in some jurisdictions it has not been thought a violation of the\r\ntheory of the separation of powers to allow the judge or the whole\r\ncourt to appoint him. Such indeed would seem the proper course. But\r\nin many counties the business of court-clerking is hardly onerous\r\nenough to engage a separate officer and the duties have accordingly\r\nbeen transferred to the county clerk. This officer usually performs\r\na variety of functions, among which are his services as clerk of the\r\ncounty board and as the local custodian or register of legal papers\r\nrequired to be filed under certain state laws. In counties where this\r\n“bunching” of functions has to be resorted to, the least that should\r\nbe done by way of readjustment should be to help along the unification\r\nof the county government by vesting the appointment of the county\r\nclerk in the county board or a county executive to be established.\r\nIn the larger counties where the volume of county business warrants a\r\nseparation of functions, there seems to be no sound reason why such\r\nduties as the filing of papers should not be in the hands of an officer\r\nappointed by some state official, to represent him in the locality.\r\nIn this way certain counties at least would be completely divested\r\nof responsibilities of which they appear never to have acquitted\r\nthemselves too well. The county’s ultimate place in the sun is being\r\ndetermined by a stripping process: the state is taking up its work.\r\n\r\nThus in the domain of charities. We pointed out in Chapter IX that\r\nthe county was hopelessly deficient in caring for the insane, the\r\ndefectives and the criminals. Modern methods, which are humane methods,\r\nhave come to demand strict classification as the very starting point\r\nfor treatment. But unless the number of subjects for treatment is\r\nreasonably large, the expense of such classification is prohibitive.\r\nMost counties cannot supply the numbers. They find themselves in the\r\npredicament of a rural sheriff who has in custody an average of perhaps\r\nsix prisoners. If his county were to obey the law it would have ready\r\nat all times an establishment which provided special accommodations for\r\nalmost forty different classes of inmates.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the only course is to transfer as many\r\nclasses of prisoners as possible to the care of a larger unit of\r\ngovernment that is able economically to segregate. This transfer\r\nactually began in some of the older states in the eighteenth century.\r\nMassachusetts led the movement by erecting a special prison on\r\nCastle Island for the most desperate type of convicts. In 1796, New\r\nYork began the construction of two state prisons in New York and\r\nAlbany. In 1816, Ohio built a state penitentiary at Columbus and in\r\n1839, Michigan completed its first state prison at Jackson. Reform\r\ninstitutions in this country began to be established in Massachusetts\r\nin 1846 when juvenile offenders were removed from local jails and\r\nstate prisons. Since then separate institutions for boys and girls\r\nhave been established in nearly all of the eastern states. New York in\r\n1877 erected the first reformatory to which adult convicts could be\r\ncommitted under an indeterminate sentence.\r\n\r\nAs for the care of the insane, this was the first department of\r\npublic welfare administration that was taken over by the whole state,\r\nbeginning with the establishment of the first hospital in Utica, New\r\nYork, in 1843. From time to time other states have followed New York’s\r\nexample until nearly every state has one or more hospitals. With\r\nthe increase in the number of institutions in a given state further\r\nsegregation and classification of inmates has been possible. State\r\ninstitutions now furnish the means for appropriate education for the\r\nmentally defective who formerly were left to shift for themselves in\r\nmismanaged county almshouses. The deaf, dumb and blind have been taken\r\ncare of in similar fashion. Indeed, the function of county poor relief\r\nwould now seem to approach as its ideal, the complete transfer to the\r\nstate of all charity functions except possibly a certain amount of\r\ntemporary “out-door” relief. But even this rather narrow field has been\r\ninvaded, for, in New England and New York, at least, a class of “state\r\npoor” is known to the statutes.\r\n\r\nThat the county has often sadly broken down in the guardianship of\r\nlife and property is a fact which has come into prominence within\r\nvery recent years. As the police force of the big cities become\r\nmore and more efficient the field of operation for criminals is\r\ntransferred to the suburbs, to the small towns and villages and to\r\nthe open country and the police problem in the rural sections takes\r\non a semi-metropolitan aspect. Good roads, the automobile and the\r\ntelephone have facilitated the business of thugs and burglars as well\r\nas of honest citizens. Said the district attorney of Niagara County,\r\nNew York, recently, “Nearly every post office safe in Western New\r\nYork has been robbed, and I do not now recall anybody having been\r\nconvicted for these crimes. The ordinary constable or deputy sheriff\r\ncan serve subpœnas and make a levy under an execution providing he is\r\nfeeling well, but as a general rule he is incapable of coping with even\r\na third-class criminal.” Numerous other equally forcible official\r\nstatements of the same tenor have been collected by the New York\r\nCommittee on State Police.\r\n\r\nTo cope with these crimes of violence and cunning the untrained,\r\npolitically selected sheriff of the typical rural county is but\r\nsadly equipped. He is a temporary elected official to begin with,\r\nunschooled in the ways of criminals and unfamiliar with any of the\r\nvast paraphernalia of investigation that go to make up a modern police\r\nsystem. Certain parts of the country moreover have peculiar periodical\r\ndisturbances on a larger scale than criminals operate--riots, lynching\r\nparties, flood disasters, strikes. These occasions demand the temporary\r\nmobilizing of a comparatively large, well-organized and disciplined\r\nforce to handle the situation with firmness and fairness. It is no\r\nplace for the crude old-fashioned sheriff’s posse.\r\n\r\nAt the present time it is the frequent practice on such occasions to\r\ncall out the state militia. But while this organization has often\r\ndoubtless rendered effective service, police duty is not its proper\r\noccupation. Every year enlistments fall far below the adequate figure\r\nbecause young men in business and professional life deem it obnoxious\r\nto leave their appointed tasks to do a professional policeman’s work.\r\nIn the discussion of “preparedness” measures it has frequently been\r\nproposed that the militia be enlisted solely for national defense and\r\nthat a special fighting force be developed for state police duty. If\r\nsuch a force were organized on a permanent basis it would practically\r\nrelieve the sheriff and the constables from police duty.\r\n\r\nA model for such a force is found in the Pennsylvania State\r\nConstabulary, which has been in existence since 1902. This is an\r\norganization of two hundred and twenty mounted policemen formed\r\ninto four companies under a superintendent of police. Every year it\r\npatrols 660,000 miles of rural roads and not only keeps the rural\r\nsections singularly free from criminals but has performed numerous\r\nother distinctive services. It has prevented disastrous fires and mine\r\nexplosions, quelled riots, stopped illegal hunting and maintained\r\nquarantine during epidemics of disease. It was this constabulary that\r\nhandled the tremendous crowds at the Gettysburg Centennial in 1913.\r\nThe force is made up of picked men who are taught the laws of the\r\ncommonwealth and schooled to enforce them with absolute impartiality\r\nagainst offenders of all classes. It has been free from politics and\r\nhas won the respect of all classes of the people.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of highways[18] the county, under the pressure of the\r\ngood-roads movement, has been rapidly yielding its control to the\r\ncentral government. The good-roads problem simply outgrew the county.\r\nIt could not be handled efficiently through so small a unit. In the\r\ncourse of railway development everywhere the old lines of tributary\r\ntraffic by wagon road from the farms to the shipping centers were\r\ngreatly modified. Their objective point came to have no particular\r\nreference to the boundaries of the county or the location of the county\r\nseat. Traffic from one county destroyed the roads of another without\r\nsupplying any compensatory advantages to the latter. Modern road\r\nconstruction, particularly since the advent of the automobile, created\r\ntechnical engineering problems far beyond the capacity of the local\r\nofficials to solve. Without the aid of better equipped agencies than a\r\nunit so small as the county could afford most of the rural roads of the\r\ncounty must have gone to rack and ruin, to say nothing of their meeting\r\nthe demands of present day traffic. But forty-two state governments,\r\nup to 1915, had come to the rescue, either by supplying financial aid,\r\nauthorizing the employment of convict labor or by furnishing expert\r\nadvice founded upon scientific research. Up to the year 1914 only\r\nFlorida, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas had\r\nmade no provision whatever for state participation in road work.\r\n\r\nBut the significant point to be noted here is the strong tendency\r\nto take entirely out of the hands of the county the whole burden,\r\nfinancial and otherwise, of the great trunk lines and in many cases\r\nto impose standards and specifications for construction even where the\r\ncounty does its own road building. Thus, Massachusetts, up to January\r\n1, 1914, had completed more than one thousand miles of state highway\r\nthrough the issuance of state bonds and the levying of automobile\r\ntaxes, the counties being required to refund the state twenty-five\r\nper cent. of the cost of construction. New York established a highway\r\ndepartment in 1898 and has authorized bond issues of $100,000,000 for\r\na state system of roads which has already reached an advanced stage\r\nof construction. Virginia, Ohio, Maryland and California have made\r\nmuch progress toward a state road system, the California plan calling\r\nfor two main highways running the length of the state and a system of\r\nlaterals connecting the county seats with the trunk lines. The state of\r\nIowa has gone so far as to place all road work in the state under the\r\ndirection of its highway department.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the dominion of the county is being invaded at sundry points.\r\nThe unification of the judiciary (which it must be admitted has not\r\nyet progressed very far), the gradual transfer of the charity and\r\ncorrectional work to the state government, the establishment of a\r\nstate police and the more imminent abridgment of county control over\r\nhighways--these movements unmistakably and definitely seem to point the\r\nultimate displacement of the county as an important agent of public\r\nservice in particular fields.\r\n\r\nBut that is but one side of the story. For while, on the one hand, the\r\nimportance of the county is threatened in particular fields there seems\r\nto be before it in other directions a career of greater usefulness than\r\never before. This present observation, however, applies only to those\r\nstates where the town or township has come in for particular emphasis,\r\nor where, as will be suggested later in the discussion, the principle\r\nof federation may be adopted by a number of contiguous municipalities\r\nas a step toward consolidation of local governments.\r\n\r\nIn a number of states where the New England influence has been strong\r\nthe town is frequently the unit (though not always exclusively) for\r\nthe custodianship of certain records such as deeds and mortgages, for\r\npublic health administration, for commitment of paupers, for road\r\nconstruction and maintenance or for tax assessment and collection.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the county to the town in these concerns is analogous\r\nto that of the state to county in such matters as the care of the\r\ninsane and the control of trunk-line highways. It is a question of\r\nfinding a unit large enough (and not too large) to fit the problem in\r\nhand. Public health, for example, is largely a matter of controlling\r\nsources of disease in milk and water supply, which under modern methods\r\nof living are usually much more widely distributed than the area which\r\nis served. Effective control in that case would simply mean control\r\nthrough a unit larger than the town, to wit: the county, unless control\r\non a still wider scale should prove feasible. Similarly in the matter\r\nof police protection: the town constable is an anachronism in these\r\ndays of rapid transit. The county is a more appropriate police unit\r\nthan the town. Town custodianship of records means duplication, lack of\r\nstandards and waste. Town commitment of paupers to the county almshouse\r\nor poor farm is a temptation on the part of the smaller locality to\r\nshift its burdens on to the shoulders of the whole county.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to highway construction, the high technical skill which\r\nneeds to go into the work is a commodity which comes too high for a\r\ntown and even, as we have pointed out, for the county.\r\n\r\nBut the most serious misfits of town government are the local agents\r\nof tax administration. Wherever the town is the smallest tax unit not\r\nonly is the number of officials needlessly multiplied, but diverse\r\nstandards of property valuation are set up and competition is resorted\r\nto between towns with a view to escaping their just share of taxation.\r\nWithout a dissenting voice the recognized tax experts of the county are\r\nfirmly of the opinion that the town as a unit of tax assessment and tax\r\ncollection must give way to the county.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the readjustments that are working out the ultimate destiny of\r\nthe county are not wholly of a negative sort. It is not all a matter of\r\ntrimming the county’s wings.\r\n\r\n[16] Variously designated in different states as state’s attorney,\r\nprosecutor of the pleas, county attorney and solicitor.\r\n\r\n[17] In Pennsylvania known as the “prothonotary.”\r\n\r\n[18] This discussion of highway matters is based principally upon a\r\nmonograph by J. E. Pennybacker, Chief of Road Economics, Office of\r\nPublic Roads, Department of Agriculture. Y. B. Separate, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCOUNTY HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome counties indeed are awakening to a sense of their identity and are\r\nasserting with much vigor their ability to organize and manage many\r\nconcerns which have been conspicuously mishandled either by the state\r\nauthorities or by the smaller local units.\r\n\r\nNowhere has the need for “readjustment” to meet this demand been more\r\nkeenly appreciated than in California. Elsewhere in these chapters\r\nwe have referred to the great diversity in the underlying social and\r\nphysical conditions in that state. To meet this situation fifty-six\r\n“general” laws (that were not general at all) had been enacted, for as\r\nmany counties. No other method of individualizing county government\r\nhad been resorted to until 1911. At that time the progressive leaders\r\nin the legislature wished to bring government, all down the line,\r\ninto sympathy with standards of simplicity and efficiency that were\r\nthen beginning to be accepted. For a time county government seemed to\r\npresent an insuperable obstacle: how could a state system be devised\r\nthat would square with these new ideas? Then it was remembered that\r\nfor upwards of thirty years the _cities_ of California had been\r\ndetermining for themselves what municipal officers should be chosen,\r\nhow they should be chosen and what powers they should exercise.\r\nCalifornia was a pioneer in municipal home rule and the system had\r\nworked pretty much to everybody’s satisfaction.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as counties have much more intimate relations with\r\nthe state government it seemed impracticable to allow them quite so\r\nlarge discretion as the cities, in determining the powers they should\r\nenjoy. And so, the California amendment gives the people of the county\r\nfreedom to determine the form and detail of the county organization,\r\nsubject to the proviso that each of the necessary county officers such\r\nas sheriff, district attorney, etc., must be maintained to execute the\r\nstate law within the county. Members of the county board of supervisors\r\nmust be elected, but not necessarily by districts. All other county\r\nofficers, except the superior court judges, may be either elective or\r\nappointive in a manner set forth in a county charter.\r\n\r\nThe procedure by which California counties may take advantage of the\r\nhome-rule privilege is as follows: A board of fifteen freeholders is\r\nelected, either in pursuance of an ordinance adopted by three fifths of\r\nthe members of the board of supervisors, or of a petition signed by\r\nfifteen per centum of the qualified electors of the county, computed\r\nupon the total number of votes cast therein for all candidates for\r\ngovernor at the last preceding gubernatorial election. Within one\r\nhundred and twenty days from the time their election is declared the\r\nboard of freeholders must prepare and cause to be published a charter\r\nfor the government of the county. Within sixty days after its first\r\npublication (unless a general election intervenes) the charter is\r\nsubmitted to the voters of the county for adoption or rejection. It is\r\nthen submitted to the legislature at its next session for approval or\r\nrejection but not for amendment. But since a California legislature\r\nin thirty-seven years has never been known to reject a charter or\r\na charter amendment of a city, the outlook for a policy of county\r\nnon-interference would seem to be good.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that the California plan is too radical a change\r\nfor states which have not yet granted freedom to their cities. A less\r\nsweeping way of affording relief from iron-clad forms of government is\r\nfound in the statutes of Illinois, New Jersey and other states, through\r\nwhich it is possible for any county to pass from one prescribed form to\r\nanother by petition and popular election. Similar laws are in operation\r\nin a number of states permitting cities to adopt the commission plan,\r\nand in four states the cities may make a choice between three or four\r\nforms under an optional law.\r\n\r\nFollowing the passage of such a city law in New York, the County\r\nGovernment Association and the official commissions on the\r\nreorganization of government in Nassau and Westchester counties\r\nmemorialized the constitutional convention of 1915 for amendments which\r\nwould authorize the counties to adopt a plan of organization suited to\r\ntheir local needs. These associations formulated the question of county\r\nadjustment for “up-state” New York counties in these words:\r\n\r\n First: That the Legislature should be required by the Constitution\r\n to provide optional plans of county government, any one of which any\r\n county may adopt by a vote of the people.\r\n\r\n Second: That the Legislature should in such plans confer upon the\r\n Board of Supervisors or other governing body in such county such\r\n powers of local legislation as the Legislature may deem expedient.\r\n\r\n Third: That the Constitution should require that no such plan of\r\n government should be imposed on any county until approved by the\r\n electors thereof and that no amendment to any plan of government\r\n should affect any county which has previously adopted such plan,\r\n unless such amendment is accepted by such county, or unless such\r\n amendment relates to some state function.\r\n\r\n Fourth: That the Constitution should require that all laws relating\r\n to the government of counties should be general both in terms and in\r\n effect, except that special or local laws relating to such government\r\n may be passed, but shall take effect only on approval of the county\r\n affected.\r\n\r\nThe California amendment has been put to use in the four counties of\r\nLos Angeles, San Bernardino, Tehama, and Butte, all of which have their\r\nspecial “home-rule” charters. Its early use is contemplated in Alameda,\r\nNapa and Santa Barbara counties. Since 1911 the scope of the amendment\r\nhas been broadened so as to permit of considerable latitude in the\r\nconsolidation of city and county governments.\r\n\r\nSuch is the counter-movement to centralized state control. In no wise\r\nare the two in the least inconsistent, for the latter tendency is to\r\nlimit the subjects in which the county acts in the capacity of a local\r\nstate agent while the former concerns itself simply with _methods_\r\nof performing service under local popular control.\r\n\r\nThe home-rule movement, if it may so be indicated, is practical\r\nevidence that people are regarding counties as something more than mere\r\ngeographical expressions. Counties are _thinking_ units. They are\r\ncapable of framing local policies. Therefore they would extend their\r\nopportunities to think and to express themselves.\r\n\r\nThis idea seems to be at the bottom of the local option policy of the\r\norganized anti-liquor forces throughout a great portion of the country.\r\nShrewd tactics, of course, has a good deal to do with it, for county\r\nand other forms of local option are but the thin side of a wedge to\r\nstate-wide and even nation-wide prohibition. But for the present\r\nat least, organizations like the Anti-Saloon League realize that\r\ncounties are very handy and convenient units of public sentiment and\r\nhave been instrumental in securing county option laws in many states,\r\nincluding Idaho, Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota,\r\nMontana, Oregon, Texas. Incidentally, the county option plan makes the\r\npublic policy district in liquor matters coincide with districts for\r\nenforcement, thus minimizing the danger of nullification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCONSOLIDATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle cry of local freedom comes up loudest from urban centers.\r\nThe simple reason is that the counties were devised originally for\r\ncommunities in a state of nature--a few people, widely scattered, all\r\nbut oblivious to the existence or need of government. City communities\r\non the other hand are highly complex, individualized, differentiated\r\nunits. Accordingly, their governmental garments must be custom-made.\r\n\r\nCity governments indeed were instituted partly to escape the\r\nstrait-jacket inflexibility of the counties. Gradually, as we have\r\nseen, they elbowed the county governments into a dark corner, to the\r\ninfinite debasement of the sheriff, the coroner, the poor master and\r\nthe tax collector and other typical accessories of the county.\r\n\r\nBut almost everywhere, at some point short of full county annihilation,\r\nthe pressure of the city stopped. Perhaps it was the politicians who\r\nintervened, to save “the boys” at the court house; or perhaps it\r\nwas the feeling that seems to have settled down upon our political\r\nthinking, that counties, like death and taxes, have to be.\r\n\r\nWithin very recent years, bold spirits in some of the metropolitan\r\ncenters have begun to feel that the county, in their particular\r\ncommunities, was a public nuisance and have been “going” for it.\r\nThus the New York _Times_, when the New York Constitutional\r\nConvention was in session in 1915, delivered not a few strokes for a\r\nproposition to abolish existing boundaries of the sixty-one counties\r\nand substitute therefor eight administrative districts. Cleveland,\r\nOhio, reformers would like to have that city divorce itself from the\r\nrural part of Cuyahoga County. In Rochester, a recent survey has\r\nsuggested a similar course with reference to Monroe County. Studies\r\nhave also been made recently (1916) by the City Club of Milwaukee.\r\nA member of the city commission in Jersey City has recently caused\r\nto be passed in the legislature a bill providing for a vote on\r\nconsolidation of municipalities in Hudson County on a sort of borough\r\nplan. In Cincinnati the question of consolidation of the city with\r\nHamilton County was recently opened, apparently for the first time,\r\nin newspaper discussions. In the 1916 New York legislature there was\r\nunder discussion a bill extending control of the board of estimate\r\nand apportionment in New York City over the employees of the five\r\ncounties within the city. This was in line with a recent report by the\r\nchamberlain and the commissioner of accounts of New York City submitted\r\nto the Constitutional Convention, which pointed out the advantages\r\nof the abolition of counties in New York City and the transfer of\r\ntheir functions to the control of the city authorities. St. Louis City\r\nactually accomplished the fact in 1876 when it separated from St.\r\nLouis County. Baltimore and a number of Virginia cities have long been\r\nseparated (for historical rather than reformatory reasons, however,)\r\nfrom the surrounding rural or suburban territory.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the process of relocation of county boundary lines is very\r\nmuch like the reversing of a long series of court decisions. Local\r\ntradition and the gradual crystallizing of the interests of local\r\npoliticians militate powerfully to maintain the _status quo_. And,\r\nyet, for all that, the shifting of boundary lines must inevitably come,\r\nif local governments are to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nJust where and by what criteria the new lines are to be laid is no\r\neasy question to decide; our metropolitan centers are of such various\r\norigins and in such differing degrees of development. The committee\r\non City-County Consolidation of the National Municipal League in\r\na preliminary report rendered in 1916 seeks to classify the urban\r\ncommunities in this fashion:\r\n\r\n “The simplest type of urban county is that in which the geographical\r\n limits of the two local units are identical and the population has\r\n grown up out of a single well-defined historical nucleus. Among other\r\n communities there would fall within this classification the cities of\r\n Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco and Baltimore and eighteen cities\r\n in Virginia.\r\n\r\n “A second type is that in which a single city furnishes an\r\n overwhelming proportion of the population, but occupies a relatively\r\n small part of an otherwise rural territory. Among the cities which\r\n fall in this classification are Buffalo, Milwaukee and Cleveland.\r\n\r\n “The third type is that in which a city of predominating size\r\n and importance is surrounded by a number of smaller but vigorous\r\n municipalities which have grown up not as suburbs of the main city,\r\n but out of independent historical beginnings. Cases in point are the\r\n two largest counties of New Jersey, Hudson and Essex.\r\n\r\n “A fourth type is one which contains several strong municipalities,\r\n no one of which has achieved a position of undisputed leadership.\r\n Alameda County, Cal., which contains the cities of Oakland, Alameda\r\n and Berkeley will serve to illustrate.\r\n\r\n “The most advanced type of the city-county problem involves the\r\n adjustment of the political to the physical and social unity of a\r\n great urban area, regardless of established boundaries of either\r\n cities or counties. The metropolitan districts of New York and\r\n Massachusetts are the most conspicuous illustrations of this problem.”\r\n\r\nThe key to reconstruction is the same in every case: simplification.\r\nEliminate duplication of civil divisions; substitute one government for\r\ntwo or many (in the case of Chicago, twenty-two!). There is a good deal\r\nof _logic_ in a separate local government to serve as a state\r\nagency. But everywhere the people have waived the right or privilege of\r\na logical government when they have illogically insisted upon selecting\r\ntheir officers locally. When the district attorney, for instance, is\r\nchosen by the electors of the county he may be legally the state’s\r\nrepresentative but he is _practically_ a local officer in very\r\nmuch the same sense as the mayor. Then why, for legal fiction’s sake,\r\ndistinguish between the city and the county?\r\n\r\nOne American city-county has not only seen the inefficiency and\r\nhypocrisy of the dual system but has actually wiped out the last\r\nsemblance of distinction between the two divisions. The story is told\r\nin legal form in Article XX of the Colorado constitution:\r\n\r\n “The municipal corporation known as the city of Denver, and all\r\n municipal corporations and that part of the quasi-municipal\r\n corporation known as the County of Arapahoe, in the state of Colorado,\r\n included into the exterior boundaries of the said city of Denver, as\r\n the same shall be bounded when this amendment takes effect, are hereby\r\n consolidated and are hereby declared to be a single body politic and\r\n corporate, by the name of the city and county of Denver.”\r\n\r\nBy this same amendment the city and county were declared to be a single\r\njudicial district of the state, and county officers were disposed of by\r\nprescribing that\r\n\r\n “the then mayor, auditor, engineer, council (which shall perform the\r\n duties of a board of county commissioners), police magistrate, chief\r\n of police and boards, of the city of Denver shall become respectively,\r\n said officers of the city and county of Denver, and said engineer\r\n shall be _ex-officio_ surveyor and said chief of police shall be\r\n _ex-officio_ sheriff of the city and county of Denver; and the\r\n then clerk and _ex-officio_ recorder, treasurer, assessor and\r\n coroner of the county of Arapahoe and the justices of the peace and\r\n constables holding office within the city of Denver, shall become,\r\n respectively, said officers of the city and county of Denver, and the\r\n district attorney shall be _ex-officio_ attorney of the city and\r\n county of Denver.”\r\n\r\nIn 1913 an amendment to the Denver charter, adopted by popular vote,\r\nprovided for the commission form of government with the usual divisions\r\nof administration into five departments respectively of Property,\r\nFinance, Safety, Improvements and Social Welfare. To some one of these\r\ncommissionerships was assigned jurisdiction over each of the several\r\ncounty officers, as appropriately as the conditions would permit.\r\n\r\nThe process of amalgamation was made complete when in May, 1916, Denver\r\nabandoned the commission plan and made the mayor chief executive of the\r\ncounty as well as of the city, with appropriate appointing power.\r\n\r\nIn New York, consolidation has extended to most of the fiscal\r\nfunctions, tending to leave intact only so much of the original\r\ncounty structure as is incidental to the administration of justice,\r\nincluding the courts themselves, the sheriff in his capacity of court\r\nexecutive and the court clerks. The functions of the county treasurer\r\nhave been transferred to the city chamberlain and the comptroller,\r\nand the department of taxes and assessments has been attached to the\r\ncity organization. The separate governing bodies of the five counties\r\nhave been swept away and their powers transferred to the city Board\r\nof Estimate and Apportionment and Board of Aldermen. New York City\r\nalso has not only taken over the function of public charities, but\r\nits Department of Corrections has been steadily encroaching upon the\r\nprerogatives of the sheriffs. The future issue of city consolidation\r\nthere is accordingly reduced to a matter of abolishing the five\r\ncounties and transferring their functions to officers under city\r\ncontrol and making the independent elective officers such as the\r\nsheriff, district attorney, clerk and register appointive by either\r\ncity or state authorities.\r\n\r\n[19]In spite of much that remains to be done, consolidation has\r\nproceeded to an advanced stage also in Boston, though hardly in a\r\ndirect line towards greater simplicity. Before it became a city in 1820\r\na conflict had arisen as to the jurisdiction of the town, and of the\r\ncourt of sessions for Suffolk County, respecting highways and taxation.\r\nThe legislature thereupon abolished the court and transferred its\r\nadministrative functions to the mayor and council of Boston. Boston,\r\nhowever, is not geographically identical with Suffolk County, since\r\nthe latter for the purposes of the administration of justice, includes\r\nthe city of Chelsea and the towns of Revere and Winthrop. Boston has\r\nthe title to all the real and personal property of Suffolk County but\r\nalso pays the entire expense of its administration. The treasurer and\r\nauditor of accounts of the city act in similar capacities for the\r\ncounty of Suffolk. But there are seven elective county officials and\r\nseveral, virtually independent of each other, who are chosen by the\r\ngovernor or the justice of the Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThis situation as to the actual political Boston is confusing\r\nenough. Metropolitan Boston on the other hand, comprises thirty-nine\r\nmunicipalities situated in five counties, which make up a compact\r\ncommunity of a million five hundred thousand inhabitants. These centers\r\nhave every facility for communication and transportation. And the state\r\nhas indeed recognized the unity of the district by establishing such\r\nagencies of administration as the metropolitan park commission and the\r\nmetropolitan water and sewer board.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has proceeded so far as to have a single governing body\r\nand a single set of fiscal officers for city and county.\r\n\r\nWith this, the recital of actual accomplishments toward formal\r\nconsolidation is about complete. The advantages of consolidation as\r\nthey appear to a disinterested observer are obvious. But the process\r\nis usually difficult in the extreme, especially as it relates to the\r\nequitable distribution of assets and liabilities of the parts to be\r\nconsolidated. New York City only accomplished this by assuming the\r\ndebts of the outlying counties and municipalities. But in the course of\r\nnineteen years not even that generous concession has sufficed to the\r\nvigorous local spirit of Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERATION\r\n\r\nWhere immediate consolidation at a single stroke is out of the\r\nquestion, as is apparently almost always the case, a more easy\r\ntransition is suggested by the recommendations of the City and County\r\nGovernment Association of Alameda County, California. Realizing\r\nthat a powerful local sentiment in the outlying territory militated\r\nirresistibly against annexation to the city of Oakland or, in fact, any\r\nform of complete organic union of the municipalities in the county,\r\nthis Association has proposed as the logical first step to a more\r\neconomically organized county, a plan of federation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORGANIZATION CHART For the City and County of Alameda\r\nand its Boroughs as Proposed in the Tentative Charter Submitted by the\r\nCity and County Government Association]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH of PROPOSED CITY and COUNTY of ALAMEDA\r\nSHOWING PROPOSED BOROUGHS]\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed plan the governing body would consist of one\r\ncouncillor from each of twenty-one districts. Unlike the present\r\nboard of supervisors in Alameda County, the new body would have only\r\nlegislative functions. The functions of the county, as a public\r\ncorporation, would be broadened to include a number of interests\r\nwhich the municipalities are conceived to have in common. Police\r\nprotection, for instance, would revert from the cities back to the\r\ncounty, where it was originally lodged, on the theory that crime\r\nthrives in a certain social and physical environment and knows nothing\r\nand cares less for corporate limits. And inasmuch also as the ravages\r\nof fire and disease are the interests of a territory rather than the\r\ncorporate boundaries of a city, the control of these perils would\r\nalso be transferred to the county. The installation of the plan would\r\nalso result in the abolishment of the dual system of tax assessment\r\nand tax collection. To the smaller units would be left jurisdiction\r\nover their more distinctively local affairs such as public works. The\r\nidentity of the individual cities, which would be known as “boroughs,”\r\nwould thus remain intact, for they would retain their local governing\r\nbodies to frame strictly local policies. At the same time the general\r\norganization of the local government would provide for the common\r\ninterests of the constituent members.\r\n\r\nSome such plan of federation, as a transition step toward unity, would\r\nseem to commend itself to several important counties which are made\r\nup of communities like those which compose Alameda County. How these\r\ncommunities in the face of increased cost of government and the greater\r\ndemands for public service are much longer to resist some measures\r\ntoward greater organic unity it is difficult to conceive.\r\n\r\nEven in the domain of public works the desirability of unified control\r\nis often of much importance. Thus in Essex County, N. J., it was\r\ndiscovered as early as 1894 that no adequate provision for a public\r\npark system could be worked out by the separate municipalities in\r\nthat distinctly urban county. In the case of certain thorough-fares\r\nwhich ran through two or more of these cities, it was highly desirable\r\nto effect some sort of a continuous, uniform improvement. Certain\r\nlowlands, also, were found to lie partly in one municipality and partly\r\nin another, so that neither city could act to advantage independently.\r\nSome of the cities had no available space for park purposes, while\r\nothers had the space, without the resources or the need for developing\r\nit. From every point of view the obvious course to pursue led to\r\na general consolidation of park interests, and a comprehensive\r\nwell-balanced park plan, county-wide in its scope. And so there was\r\ncreated a county park commission which has exclusive jurisdiction over\r\npark developments and maintenance. It is noteworthy however that this\r\ncommission, as we have already indicated, was not made an integral\r\npart of the existing county government but a separate corporation; the\r\nheads of this new department of government were made appointive by the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court in order that politics might be eliminated\r\nfrom its control. Had the metropolitan area been under a single\r\nmunicipal control, no such complication would have been necessary. The\r\ncounty government was deemed unfit to represent the unity of interest\r\nthroughout the several communities when an important new undertaking\r\nwas under consideration.\r\n\r\nOf the realization of the idea of the metropolitan unification under\r\ncounty control the London County Council[20] is the world’s most\r\nstriking and instructive example. London, through the centuries, as\r\nsome of our American cities have done in a lifetime, had grown from\r\na multitude of small independent local communities into a single,\r\ncontinuous metropolitan district. However, the constituent units, of\r\nwhich the ancient city of London is but one, retained their historic\r\nidentities and clung to their historic institutions. In this peculiar\r\nway London perhaps resembles the metropolitan district of New York or\r\nBoston or Essex County in New Jersey. From time to time new units of\r\nadministration were laid down to correspond to modern needs, until the\r\nsystem of local government was complexity itself. In 1855, Parliament\r\ntook the first step toward adjusting this situation, creating the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works which, in the thirty-three years of its\r\nlife, was responsible for much of the city’s physical improvement.\r\nBut corruption and scandal entered its ranks and it was legislated\r\nout of existence. The London County Council was then established\r\nwith a membership composed of one hundred and eighteen councillors,\r\ntwo members being chosen from each of the fifty-seven “parliamentary\r\nboroughs” or election districts and four from the city of London. From\r\nwithin or without its own membership the councillors select nineteen\r\naldermen who serve for a six-year term. Through its committees the\r\nCouncil gets into touch with its various problems of the county, while\r\nengineering, medical, financial and other experts are held responsible\r\nfor actual administration. A “clerk” who is chosen by the Council is in\r\nfact the coördinator of the whole system, somewhat in the manner of a\r\ncity manager in the United States. A comptroller serves as the fiscal\r\nagent of the Council.\r\n\r\nUpon the county of London thus organized are imposed many of the\r\nfunctions which in America are almost universally entrusted to cities:\r\nextensive authority over public health, all matters relating to\r\nfire protection, all metropolitan street improvement projects, the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of bridges that cross the Thames, the\r\nadministration of the building laws and the maintenance of tenement\r\nhouses. The Council has also limited powers over what we in this\r\ncountry term “public utilities”; it has power to establish technical\r\nschools and to build and maintain parks and recreation centers. Its\r\nfinancial powers, while subject in their exercise to the control of the\r\nHome Office, are comprehensive.\r\n\r\nNor is the county of London but a city by another name. The\r\nmetropolitan boroughs have their separate identity and a very real\r\nauthority, including a certain control over public health and public\r\nlighting. In any conflict between the boroughs and the county the Home\r\nOffice acts as the final arbiter.\r\n\r\nLondon county has a record of which it has good reason to be proud. To\r\nits credit it has a long list of mighty public works, conceived and\r\nexecuted in a spirit of public service. Apparently neither graft nor\r\nthe spoils system have obtained a foothold. Here is a county which\r\nhas become so conspicuous and interesting to its citizens that they\r\nform themselves into local political parties, founded upon genuine\r\ndifferences of opinion and policy to make their citizenship felt in its\r\ngovernment. In the seats of the governing body sit, not the typical\r\noffice seeker to which we are accustomed in America, but men of the\r\ninfluence and ability of Lord Rosebery, afterwards the prime minister\r\nof England, and Sir John Lubbock.\r\n\r\nAll of which would seem to go to prove that even at this late date,\r\nthe county is capable of a very honorable service, if it is taken\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is of utmost importance to the future of American\r\ncities. Aside from the obvious economies of a single local government\r\nas opposed to two or more, it seems essential that the future\r\ndevelopment of large centers of population should not be hampered\r\nby conflicting policies of a double or multiple system of local\r\ngovernments. It is obvious, moreover, that perils which continually\r\nthreaten the population of urban communities, such as fire, crime and\r\ncontagious diseases, constitute unified problems which are co-extensive\r\nwith congested areas. It would seem essential that the control of these\r\nperils should be a unified one and that too much reliance should not be\r\nplaced upon a spirit of coöperation between different units.\r\n\r\n[19] See Hormell, O. C. “Boston’s County Problems,” _Annals American\r\nAcademy of Political and Social Science_, May, 1913, pp. 134 _et\r\nseq._\r\n\r\n[20] See Munro, _Government of European Cities_, pp. 345 _et.\r\nseq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION: PRINCIPLES, PRECEDENTS AND PROPOSALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been at some pains to put the county into right relationships.\r\nIdeally, it is to be a supervised local division of the state\r\nadministration (such supervision to insure strict accountability but\r\nto be unobstructive); it is to be relieved by the state of not a few\r\nincompatible, back-breaking burdens; it is to have (with some necessary\r\nlimitations) a free hand in making over its internal organization for\r\nwhatever obligations of public service may be laid upon it in the\r\nfuture. In some respects its greatest service is to consist in receding\r\nentirely from public service, while in other respects its importance\r\nshould be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nPractically, these external adjusting movements will proceed\r\nconcurrently, with varying speed, according as the need for the one\r\nor the other may exist or be recognized. Their full fruition will\r\nstill leave the county, within its restricted sphere, with a very\r\ndistinct and honorable body of functions to perform. And for this,\r\nthe county, now so largely an unfit instrument of a self-governing,\r\nself-respecting community, must be made over from within.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula of reconstruction is not far to seek. In every state\r\nthe forward looking part of the citizenry which interests itself\r\nin better government for long toyed with the theory of “checks and\r\nbalances,” which might be denominated for popular purposes as “safety\r\nvia complication.” Past generations put a premium on _ingenious_\r\npolitical devices. Just as to some people medicine which is not bitter\r\nis not efficacious, so to the old school of political reformers,\r\ngovernment was dangerous if it could be seen through and understood.\r\nBut ingenuity and complexity in city government “came high.” The cost\r\nof them was “conspicuous failure.” In the end the people rebelled and\r\nthe end of the old way of thinking about government was in sight.\r\nWitness: the movements of those cities which since 1901 have so\r\ncheerfully though so thoughtfully “scrapped” the historic dogma by\r\nthe act of adopting the “commission” plan. Ingenious, complicated,\r\ninefficient, corrupt, city governments have given way literally by\r\nthe hundreds to a new system, the corner-stone principle of which is\r\nsimplicity: one set of officials to elect and watch; one place to go to\r\nget things done; one source to which to direct criticism when things go\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the Short Ballot, in its fullest implication. It is not\r\nsimply that there should be few officers to elect. County candidates\r\nare not especially obscure to rural voters and the ballots in the\r\ncountry districts are not often absurdly long. The farmer probably\r\nmakes a better job of it when it comes to making up his ticket than\r\nany other class of citizen. It is also necessary that “those officers\r\nshould be elective which are important enough to attract _and\r\ndeserve_ examination,” that is, officers who stand at the sources of\r\npublic policy--not sheriffs or coroners or county clerks; not officers\r\nwho simply follow out a statutory routine, but those who are supposed\r\nto lay out programs of county action.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the Short Ballot connotes unification of powers. For what\r\ndoes it avail to watch, to criticize a single set of officers if all\r\nthe while the really important work of the county is performed and the\r\nreally important damage is committed by the officials who are obscure\r\nand therefore unwatched?\r\n\r\nCounty government, as it stands, is the very personification of\r\nnon-conformity to these approved principles of political organization.\r\nStarting, therefore, at the base of an ideal structure, let us proceed\r\nto the task of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nUnder ideal home-rule conditions the county will have been brought face\r\nto face with the obligation to stand on its own feet. It will look\r\nabout for appropriate means to redeem that obligation. The electorate\r\nwill be made responsible for its collective conduct by virtue of\r\naccurate representation in the county’s council. Responsibility will\r\nfirst be secured in the very make-up of the governing body, which is\r\nthe source of power in any popular government. No stereotyped uniform\r\nplan of organization will do; no slavish copying of the “New England”\r\ntype, or the “southern” type: counties differ too widely for that. But\r\nnatural and legitimate cleavages of public opinion will be recognized\r\nand represented. Minor geographical divisions which have a distinct\r\nidentity may be given a separate voice in the county board, but if the\r\ncounty is a geographical and social unit, the form of the governing\r\nbody will reflect the fact. And if the county is co-extensive with a\r\ncity, that circumstance will be given due weight.\r\n\r\nBut the county board will be something more than an epitomized\r\nelectorate. It will be clothed, as such bodies rarely are, with the\r\npower not only to discover what the people want, but to translate their\r\nwishes into deeds of administration. Instead of working as now through\r\nalien instruments in the person of independent officials, it will\r\ncontrol the operating mechanism of the county, which will be of its\r\nown selection. Shall we take away from the people the power to choose\r\nthe sheriffs, the county clerk, the surveyor, the superintendent of\r\nthe poor? Yes, take away the selection, but reinforce their control.\r\nAbandon the separation of powers? Yes, do away with the three-ring (or\r\nperhaps twelve- or twenty-ring) circus, and get down to the serious\r\nbusiness of government. For business never was successfully organized\r\nexcept on the principle that the head controls the tail and all that\r\nintervenes. In terms of law, the county board, subject of course to\r\nstate legislative and administrative supervision, will exercise all the\r\npowers of the corporation, including those of appointment, of revenue\r\nraising and of appropriation.\r\n\r\nA long step toward the fulfillment of these principles in actual\r\nlife has been taken in the county of Los Angeles, Cal., one of those\r\ncommunities in which the doctrine of complexity was once carried\r\nto absurd extremes. But the new charter of this county, which was\r\nthe first to be adopted[21] under the home-rule provisions of the\r\nconstitution, proceeded in great measure in the light of the theory\r\nexemplified by the commission plan in the cities. The supervisors\r\nare retained on the elective list as the constitution requires, but\r\nthe county superintendent of schools, coroner, public administrator,\r\ncounty clerk, treasurer, tax collector, recorder and surveyor, all of\r\nwhom were formerly elected by the voters, are now appointed by and\r\nare responsible to the county governing body, which is the board of\r\nsupervisors. The sheriff, the auditor, the assessor and the district\r\nattorney are still elective. In thus extending the power of the\r\nboard of supervisors, the charter framers require that, with a few\r\nexceptions, the officers shall be chosen from competitive lists on\r\nthe basis of merit and fitness. The fee system is abolished. The Los\r\nAngeles achievement, while it falls far short of the measure of unity\r\nwhich is present in many counties governed by the commissioner system,\r\nis important as a recent conscious step toward greater simplicity.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have perfected a mechanism for expressing the general\r\nwill of the people of the county, it remains to arm the governing\r\nbody more effectively with the means for translating mere wishes into\r\nconcrete acts of administration. To put it otherwise, we must mobilize\r\nthe operating departments under effective leadership.\r\n\r\nRecall, first, our statement in an earlier chapter that the county\r\nin the United States is almost universally devoid of a definite\r\nexecutive head. One exception is the two first-class counties of New\r\nJersey (Hudson and Essex) where until recent years the so-called\r\nboard of chosen freeholders were elected from districts. Under these\r\ncircumstances the need was felt for some agency to represent the\r\nunity of interest among the several localities, in the government\r\nof the county. Accordingly, the office of supervisor was conceived.\r\nThe incumbent is elected by the people of the county and has powers\r\nnot unlike those of the mayor in many cities. He is required “to be\r\nvigilant and active in causing the laws and ordinances of the county\r\nto be executed and enforced.” Subject to the civil service law he has\r\npower to suspend and remove but not to appoint subordinates. He may\r\npropose legislation and veto resolutions.\r\n\r\nFifteen years of experience have not commended this institution to\r\nwider adoption. With one or two exceptions the supervisors, like most\r\nmayors of cities, have not been men of force or imagination and they\r\nhave been controlled, apparently, by the same political elements as the\r\nboard of freeholders upon which they were supposed to have served as a\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nAs these pages are being written, a single county in the West, almost\r\nunconsciously it would seem and under influences that upon the surface\r\nseem reactionary, has taken one of the longest progressive steps toward\r\nadministrative unity ever taken by an American county. The county in\r\nmind is Denver, Colorado. Ever since the constitution was amended in\r\n1902 the city and county have been geographically identical. Article\r\nXX, Section 2, stipulates that “the officers of the city and county\r\nof Denver shall be such as by _appointment_ or election may be\r\nprovided for by the charter.” On May 9, 1916, Denver abandoned the\r\ncommission plan of government and vested the appointment of city _and\r\ncounty_ officials in the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey and Denver experiments point in the general direction\r\nof administrative unity; they do not come within hailing distance of\r\nthe expectations which seem to be justified by recent developments\r\nin American cities. For after all, the practical problem is the same\r\nin every civil division: to dispose effectively and economically\r\nof the visible supply of work to be accomplished or service to be\r\nrendered. And this, some of the more aggressive of our cities, such\r\nas Dayton and Springfield, 0., Niagara Falls, N. Y., and some forty\r\nothers have essayed to do through a form of organization which is unity\r\nand simplicity reduced to its lowest terms: the plan of the typical\r\nbusiness corporation. A board of directors to represent the people; a\r\ncity manager to appoint and direct the heads of departments--that is\r\nall there is to it. And it works!\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion the people of our counties will surely consent to\r\na reorganization of _their_ public affairs. The members of the\r\ncounty boards will not follow the example of some of our present county\r\ncommissioners and personally descend to the management of the details\r\nof administration. They will learn the art of delegating authority\r\nwithout losing control. And just as the people will have simplified\r\ntheir problem of citizenship by concentrating their attention on the\r\ngoverning group, so the representative body will focus administrative\r\nresponsibility in a chief subordinate. To be specific, the county\r\nof the future will employ a manager chosen appropriately with sole\r\nreference to his fitness to manage public affairs and without regard to\r\nresidence, religion or views on the Mexican situation, who will pick up\r\nthe authority of the county where the board of directors leaves it off.\r\n\r\nWith the installation of the manager with adequate powers, the county\r\nwill have supplied the largest single essential in any collective\r\neffort: leadership. Without that directing, driving force it is hardly\r\nstrange that counties, up to the present, have headed for nowhere in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nAnd leadership in county affairs signifies specifically what?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it will now be possible to build up the correct sort\r\nof subsidiary organization. For instance, with such leadership it\r\nshould not have been necessary, for the lack of a proper executive\r\nresponsibility, for Hudson County in New Jersey to impose upon the\r\nlocal judges the odd function of selecting a mosquito commission, and\r\nto dispose the rest of the appointing power as the fancy of the moment\r\nmight dictate.\r\n\r\nA county manager who has the power to appoint and discharge will of\r\ncourse be in a position to issue orders with a reasonable assurance\r\nthat they will be obeyed without a writ of mandamus or some other\r\nform of judicial intervention. Public business will be speeded up\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the presence of a responsible executive will supply\r\nan indispensable condition of a scientific budget. The finance\r\ncommittee of the governing board is no proper substitute, for, as\r\nMr. Cartwright[22] says: “Such a committee cannot have either the\r\nunderstanding of the full meaning of the budget, or the personal\r\ninterest in properly performing the work of preparation that an\r\nexecutive head should have who is personally responsible in very large\r\ndegree for the success or failure of the entire county administration.\r\nThe man who is officially responsible ought personally to lay the\r\nplans, summoning to his aid such advisers as he deems best suited to\r\ngive him counsel.” The budget is the financial plan or program in a\r\ngiven year. It must see the needs of the county in their unity. It is\r\nthe proper occupation of a single directing mind which is continuously\r\nand intimately in touch through his subordinates, with every need of\r\nthe county. Not that the county manager will have the “power of the\r\npurse” and dictate the financial policy of the county. On the contrary,\r\nhe will simply formulate the financial program for his employers to\r\naccept or reject, in whole or in part as they see fit.\r\n\r\nThe county manager will also act as a balance against any undue\r\npressure from any geographical division in the county or any division\r\nof the public service. He will discover possible new services or better\r\nmethods of performing old services. In short, he will be the specially\r\naccredited agent of the county board in carrying out its policies and\r\nthe initiating force of public opinion. Through the governing board\r\nand the county manager there will be a clear and direct succession of\r\nauthority from the people to the scullion at the almshouse and the\r\nassistant turnkey at the county jail.\r\n\r\nA proposal that practically squares with this formula was put forth\r\nsome years ago by a group of Oregon citizens under the leadership of W.\r\nS. U’Ren, in a proposed amendment to the state constitution. Under the\r\nprojected scheme the county business would be in the hands of a board\r\nof three directors to be elected by the voters of the county for terms\r\nof six years. This board would have power to “make all expedient rules\r\nand regulations for the successful, efficient and economic management\r\nof all county business and property.” It would be necessary, however,\r\nto employ a business manager who would be the “chief executive of the\r\ncounty”; the choice of this officer not to be limited to the state\r\nof Oregon; his salary to be determined by the board. With him would\r\nrest the appointment of the subordinate county officers. The board of\r\ndirectors would be empowered to audit bills, either directly or through\r\nan auditor.\r\n\r\nA more complete and detailed plan of county government, following the\r\nsame general principles, was embodied in a bill introduced in the New\r\nYork legislature in 1916.[23] It provided that any county, except those\r\ncomprising New York City, might adopt the statute by petition and\r\nreferendum. The county would therefore be governed by a board of five\r\ncounty supervisors who would act through a manager, whose duties would\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n (_a_) To attend all meetings of the board of supervisors;\r\n\r\n (_b_) To see that the resolutions and other orders of the board\r\n of supervisors and the laws of the state required to be enforced by\r\n such board, are faithfully carried out by the county, including all\r\n officers chosen by the electors;\r\n\r\n (_c_) To recommend to the board of supervisors such measures as\r\n he may deem necessary or expedient for the proper administration of\r\n the affairs of the county and its several offices;\r\n\r\n (_d_) To appoint all county officers whose selection by\r\n the electors is not required by the constitution, except county\r\n supervisors and the county auditor or comptroller, for such terms of\r\n office as are provided by law.\r\n\r\nSubject to resolutions of the board of supervisors, he shall:\r\n\r\n (_e_) Purchase all supplies and materials required by every\r\n county officer, including the superintendent of the poor;\r\n\r\n (_f_) Execute contracts on behalf of the board of supervisors\r\n when the consideration therein shall not exceed five hundred dollars;\r\n\r\n (_g_) Obtain from the several county officers reports of their\r\n various activities in such form and at such times as the board of\r\n supervisors may require;\r\n\r\n (_h_) Obtain from the several county officers itemized estimates\r\n of the probable expense of conducting their offices for the ensuing\r\n year, and transmit the same to the board of supervisors with his\r\n approval or disapproval of each and all items therein, in the form of\r\n a tentative budget.\r\n\r\n (_i_) Perform such other duties as the board of supervisors may\r\n require.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of these duties the county manager would have power to\r\nexamine witnesses, take testimony under oath and make examination of\r\nthe affairs of any office.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the constitution of New York State requires the election\r\nby the people of the sheriff, district attorney, county clerk and\r\nregister, the method of choosing these officers could not be affected\r\nby statute.\r\n\r\nThe Alameda County plan referred to in the preceding chapter provides\r\nfor a city-and-county manager who would have charge not only of county\r\nadministration but of the execution of the policies of the several\r\nconstituent boroughs.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few definite proposals for fundamental political\r\nreconstruction of the county. Recalling, again, the low estate of our\r\n_city_ governments, a decade since, the hope for an early and\r\nthoroughgoing betterment of the county system, in the department of\r\nfundamental structure, would seem to be not altogether vain.\r\n\r\n[21] November, 1912.\r\n\r\n[22] Otho G. Cartwright, Director of Westchester County Research Bureau.\r\n\r\n[23] For text see Appendix, pp. 251-256.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter county government, however, involves a good deal more than a\r\nmere skeleton of organization. It is not enough to provide the means\r\nfor fixing responsibility in a general though fundamental sense, in\r\nofficers who are conspicuous and powerful. That is the beginning of\r\nefficiency. And yet “responsibility” in its greater refinements, in\r\nits more intimate applications, is precisely the key to what all the\r\nvarious prophets of better government and public administration are\r\npreaching. Turn on the light! That is what the Short Ballot movement\r\nproposes by the more sweeping fundamental changes in the structure.\r\nTurning on the light is also essence of the doctrine of better\r\naccounting, better auditing, better budget making, better purchasing\r\nand the whole tendency to greater publicity in the conduct of public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThose county commissioners out in Kansas and Iowa who paid too much for\r\ntheir bridges--what was the real trouble with them? A writer in the\r\nagricultural journal which exposed these scandals wound up his article\r\nwith an exhortation to the people to “elect good honest men.” Such\r\nadvice was at least a shade or two more constructive than the political\r\npreaching of a century ago (which still has its adherents) that public\r\nofficials tend inevitably to become thieves and crooks; that the best\r\nthat we can do is to tie their hands by ingenious “checking” and\r\n“balancing” devices until it is almost impossible for them to move.\r\nTo-day one group of political reconstructionists says: “Give these\r\nofficers plenty of power, and then watch them,” and another group,\r\nsupplementing the former, says: “Give officers the means of knowing\r\nexactly what they are doing; give also the public the means of watching\r\nintelligently and minutely; and if their public servants go wrong it is\r\n‘up to the people,’” actually as well as formally. One is quite safe in\r\nassuming, for instance, that the offices of those middle western county\r\nofficials were terribly “shy” on reliable data on bridge construction\r\nwith which to meet the wiles of the combined contractors.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, what kind of a bridge was most needed? Did they have\r\nrecords as to the volume and weight of traffic which was likely to come\r\nover the structure? Did they seek light from an engineer of untarnished\r\nreputation or did they just trust to their “horse sense” and the fact\r\nthat they “had lived there all their lives and they ought to know, if\r\nanybody did”? What did the records in the county engineer’s office show\r\nas to the relative durability and maintenance expense of steel bridges\r\nas against wooden bridges, under the peculiar local conditions?\r\n\r\nThen as to the bids on the proposed structure: how did these compare\r\nwith the cost of bridges of equal tonnage in other states and counties?\r\nHow about the current state of the steel market--would it be better to\r\nbuy now or wait a few months until business at the mills was likely to\r\nbe slack?\r\n\r\nHow about financing the bridge project? Should the cost be borne out\r\nof the current year’s revenues, should it be covered by a ten-year\r\nbond issue or should the next generation of taxpayers be saddled with\r\npayments long after the bridge had outlived its usefulness?\r\n\r\nA board of supervisors or a county manager or a county engineer armed\r\nwith an answer to this series of extremely pertinent questions and a\r\nmodicum of common honesty would be proof against ninety-nine per cent.\r\nof the “slick” deals which are so often “put over” on an unsuspecting\r\npublic and their easy-going servants.\r\n\r\nThe science of public administration consists principally in knowing\r\n_exactly_ where you are and what you are doing--knowledge\r\ngained through experimentation, investigation and comparison and by\r\nconsultation of authoritative standards and with authorities themselves.\r\n\r\nWe will illustrate this principle in a few of its applications:\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNTING\r\n\r\nThe accounting system of any organization, public or private, is useful\r\nin proportion to the definiteness of its analyses or classifications,\r\naccording to what is most important to be known. Thus, in New\r\nYork State, the statutes authorize boards of supervisors to allow\r\nclaims on the basis: (1) of specific amounts imposed by state law,\r\nsuch as the stated salaries of judges, (2) of amounts fixed by the\r\nboard of supervisors under authority of law. In at least one county\r\n(Westchester) it was formerly the custom to lump a great variety of\r\nclaims under the second heading--under the title “county audited\r\nbills”--a procedure which was satisfactory enough perhaps, if to know\r\nthe _authority_ for payment were the only information desired.\r\nBy such a system it was impossible to tell the cost of running any\r\ncounty office or department without actually tracing each voucher back\r\nto its source. Thus, it was found that, in the year 1907 the budget\r\nauthorization for the superintendent of the poor was $17,485.61, while\r\nthe expenditures shown by the treasurer’s report were $108,906.58\r\nand the actual cost of the office, when proper additions were made\r\nfrom the “county audited bills,” was $118,464.33. Discrepancies of an\r\nequally serious nature were revealed in the case of most of the other\r\noffices. The accounting system through its inexact classifications gave\r\ninformation which was useful in protecting the treasurer but which\r\nwas practically without value as a description of what the county’s\r\ndepartments were doing and how economically they were doing it.\r\n\r\nExact classification is also essential to the last degree in the\r\nmaking of the budget, to the end that actual experience in the way of\r\nrevenues received and funds disbursed may be made the reliable basis\r\nof future activities. In a well-ordered system of state supervision of\r\nlocal accounts the classifications will be made by a state official\r\nwho will have the power to enforce compliance upon the part of the\r\nfiscal officer in each county. So that in time each county will have\r\nthe inestimable advantage of being able to compare its finances with\r\nthose of other similar units. A proper accounting system will proceed\r\nso far in its analysis as to provide a large amount of data concerning\r\nthe cost of _units_ of service rendered and materials consumed.\r\nAmong other things, it will reveal at any and all times precisely what\r\nis the condition of the county’s assets both in the shape of funds and\r\nof investments; it will show how much the county actually owes and is\r\nto owe at any future date.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET\r\n\r\nOn the basis of accounts that tell in detailed classification the\r\nneeds and the resources of the county, the governing body will be able\r\nto embark upon the financial voyage of each new year with chart and\r\ncompass. At a stated time before the budget-making period the heads of\r\ndepartments, having before them the records of transactions and costs\r\nin previous years, will frame their requests for future service. But\r\nbecause of the exactness of the estimates required to be submitted, any\r\nrequest for an increase of appropriation will stand out as a shining\r\nmark. The department head will thereby be thrown on the defensive, will\r\nbe obliged to explain himself. The knowledge of that condition will\r\nhave a distinctly beneficial effect upon any desire of his to seek\r\nincreased appropriations without careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe governing body will proceed, moreover, with the certitude that\r\nthe public has at its disposal the means of knowing in detail what\r\nits government is costing. The business of the year will be treated\r\nas a program of public service; and in the framing of that program\r\nevery interested citizen and group of citizens will be urged to take\r\npart through the medium of public hearings. As the Westchester County\r\nResearch Bureau says: “It would be easy to provide an opportunity for\r\nthe filing of either objections or additional suggestions by taxpayers\r\nand for consideration of these at public hearing at the county seat\r\nbefore the board of supervisors by public notice of such filing and of\r\nsuch public hearing. Such hearings would doubtless speedily end such\r\nabuses as are exemplified in our bulletin on the Purchase of County\r\nSupplies. In the face of public objection, few supervisors would vote\r\naffirmatively for appropriations for such extravagant expenditures. The\r\ndifference in result would be that between the action of an informed\r\npublic, able to deliberate in advance upon proposed expenditures, and\r\nthe absence of action of a public ignorant of the character of such\r\nproposed expenditures--the usual condition under present methods of\r\nbudget provision for public funds.\r\n\r\n“It is easy to prevent the official adoption over public objection of\r\nextravagant estimates. It is difficult to prevent extravagant misuse\r\nof public funds appropriated in lump sums, or to rectify such misuses\r\nafter such expenditures have been incurred.”[24]\r\n\r\nComplete knowledge and complete mutual confidence and understanding on\r\nthe part of the public on the one hand and its agencies of government\r\non the other--that is the big and seemingly reasonable promise of a\r\nbudget system of the right sort. It cannot be put into operation in the\r\nfullest extent without those structural changes in county government\r\nwith which we have already dealt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDITING AND PURCHASING\r\n\r\nA special field in which exact knowledge is particularly essential as\r\na safeguard against theft is that of the auditor. To many a county\r\ntreasurer the auditing demands of the government appear to be met when\r\nsome basis of authority for a payment has been established. Sometimes\r\neven then the authority in question is not a legal one for often it may\r\nnot be established by reference to the letter of the statute but by the\r\nprecedents set by previous incumbents. Not “What does the law say about\r\nit?” but “What did ---- do in such cases?” is apt to be the question\r\nuppermost in the mind of the official. How many millions of good money\r\nhave slipped through county treasurers’ hands through such a procedure\r\nwill never be known. The state examiner who has not discovered many an\r\nold-fashioned county where many such illegal payments have been made is\r\nrare indeed.\r\n\r\nBut such post-mortem checking of illegal payments is, for the most\r\npart, but a sad business. Modern standards of auditing organization\r\nand practice aim to insure more completely that the authority for\r\npayment shall be established _before_ payment. The auditor should\r\ncertainly be wholly independent of the disbursing officer and some\r\nauthorities would also insist, of the appropriating body. Least of all\r\nshould the auditing be done by the appropriating body itself or through\r\nits committees (as is true in some states) for such an audit through\r\nlack of first-hand consideration and definite fixing of responsibility\r\nrapidly degenerates into a perfunctory performance. It is even the\r\npractice in some counties to audit bills in full board by acclamation!\r\n\r\nAnd since so large a portion of county claims are for material and\r\nsupplies for use in the construction and maintenance of roads,\r\nbridges and institutions, the work of audit cannot fail to be closely\r\nassociated with the purchasing system. The purchasing agent by\r\nwhatsoever name called, is, after all, a special sort of auditor,\r\ndealing with a variety of commodities instead of funds. As in every\r\nother branch of public service, successful purchasing depends primarily\r\non exact information, relating in this case, to standards of utility\r\nof various articles, the present and the probable future state of the\r\nmarket, the exact condition of present supplies, the honest fulfillment\r\nof contracts. Such information may come through stock ledgers,\r\ninspectors, trade journals or chemical tests.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Alameda, Cal., as a result of investigation, publicity\r\nand political pressure resulting in changes in the purchasing procedure\r\nin the county offices, the sum of $810,205 was saved on the one\r\nitem of cost of elections in the years 1912-1916. Blank affidavits\r\nof registration dropped from $16.50 to $3.30 per thousand, election\r\nballots from $22.12 to $1.65. On advertising, election proclamation,\r\netc., there was a saving during the period of 1700 per cent. And\r\nthis is by no means an unique experience. It is typical of results\r\nobtained under careful scientific purchasing methods in public work\r\neverywhere.[25] Accurate records, a study of unit costs, “pitiless\r\npublicity,” standardization and elimination of senseless waste and lost\r\nmotion constitute the explanation. The Tax Association is now urging\r\nthe consolidation of public purchasing agencies throughout the county\r\nin order to take advantage of the still greater economies which accrue\r\nto the large buyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER FORMS OF ACCOUNTING\r\n\r\nIt is not only in its material interests that the county will be in\r\nneed of exact information. Where the county comes into contact with\r\nthe human factor the importance of working in the daylight cannot be\r\noverlooked. It will not do for the officer in charge of the poor to\r\nkeep records “under his hat” concerning the inmates under his charge.\r\nSimilarly, the probation officer will investigate and account for the\r\ndelinquencies and the special needs of his wards, in a really informing\r\nway. And the sheriff, so long as he shall be the peace officer of\r\nthe county, will furnish a record of crimes committed within his\r\njurisdiction which will possibly lead to suitable preventive measures.\r\n\r\nIt is a high standard of administrative efficiency which we have set\r\nup. No single county so far as we know, measures up to it at present.\r\nNo county, apparently, without compulsion from the central state\r\ngovernment, has even made any serious progress along these lines except\r\nat the instigation of a privately supported research bureau or tax\r\nassociation. County administrative organization and procedure is virgin\r\nsoil for constructive civic effort.\r\n\r\nBut administrative procedure is not more important to county betterment\r\nthan the personnel of the organization. “Politics” in administration\r\nhas come to mean the antithesis of scientific standards. Mediocrity and\r\nincompetency sit enthroned where party expediency takes precedence over\r\nthe interests of the whole county.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MERIT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nTherefore abolish “politics!” No single county of its own initiative\r\nhas taken a more important step toward that end than Los Angeles,\r\nCalifornia, under its special home-rule charter, which is not--able for\r\nthe advanced character of its civil service provisions. Among other\r\nthings it creates a bureau of efficiency, consisting of the civil\r\nservice commission (three members), the secretary thereof and the\r\nauditor of the county. To quote the language of the charter, the duty\r\nof this bureau is that of “determining the duties of each position in\r\nthe classified service, fixing standards of efficiency, investigating\r\nthe methods of operation of the various departments and recommending to\r\nthe board of supervisors and department heads measures for increasing\r\nindividual, group and departmental efficiency, and providing for\r\nuniformity of competition and simplicity of operation.” The commission\r\nis required to “ascertain and record the comparative efficiency of\r\nemployees in the classified service” and has power after a hearing,\r\nto “dismiss from the service those who fall below the standards of\r\nefficiency established.”[26]\r\n\r\nWith a combination of a structure of government designed to fix general\r\nresponsibility, an administrative procedure designed to let daylight\r\ninto public business and an administrative personnel free to serve the\r\ninterests of the public, the people of the county will be in a position\r\nto just about get what they want, within the measure of power granted\r\nto the locality under the laws of the state.\r\n\r\n[24] “The Making of the County Budget,” Westchester County Research\r\nBureau, 1912.\r\n\r\n[25] Excellent results have been obtained by the purchasing agent of\r\nOnondaga County, New York, Mr. Frank X. Wood.\r\n\r\n[26] For full text of provisions, see Charter of Los Angeles (Appendix\r\nB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our mind’s eye we have now completely made over the system.\r\nMetropolitan counties have retired from the field; the remainder have\r\nin a large measure been put in command of their own destinies through a\r\ngenerous extension of the home-rule principle. The county politician of\r\nthe conventional type has been extinguished and single-minded service\r\nof the whole people has replaced a hyphenated allegiance that put the\r\ncounty chairman in the place of highest honor.\r\n\r\nWhat could such a county do for its citizens?\r\n\r\nIt should be kept in mind that this county of the imagination with\r\nwhich we are particularly concerned will be practically confined to\r\nrural and semi-rural localities. Here, even while we dream, a very\r\nactual metamorphosis is going on which inevitably promotes a sense of\r\ncommunity interest. Thanks to Alexander Graham Bell and Henry Ford, the\r\ncountryside is getting together in spite of itself! The rural gentry\r\nwill think in bigger units and the basis of its allegiances will be\r\ncorrespondingly broadened. And a more fundamental accomplishment for\r\ncounty betterment could not well be conceived, for, as Herbert Quick\r\nhas asked: “Did you ever know a man that was proud of his county?” The\r\nanswer to which he gives himself: “I knew but one such man and his\r\nrelations were all in county offices.”\r\n\r\nThe county of the past has lacked opportunity to “do itself proud.”\r\nThe county of the future will be equipped to do interesting things in\r\nan interesting way. But it must develop policies--real politics--as\r\na substitute for the interest that has made place hunting and place\r\nholding a basic rural industry. The farmer of the future must be\r\ngiven something more wholesome to think about “during the long winter\r\nevenings” than who is to be the next coroner; and he must cease to\r\nmeasure his freedom by the number of offices he attempts to fill with\r\nhis ballot.\r\n\r\nBut before county citizenship is raised to the point of appreciation\r\nof the new order a benevolent deed of violence must be done to a\r\npower in the community noted principally for sycophantic approval of\r\nthe administration in power, an utter lack of either conscience or\r\nideas, and “patent insides”--the county official newspaper. The cheap\r\n“boiler-plate” weekly must go the way of old Dobbin and in its place\r\nwill come some means yet to be devised, for putting out official\r\nadvertising that really advertises and furnishing news that is not only\r\n“fit to print,” but worth the while.\r\n\r\nWhen these mechanical essentials of an efficient local democracy shall\r\nhave been acquired the county will be in a position to formulate a\r\ngenuine program of service. As to the ingredients for the same a few\r\nsuggestions may be in order:\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH\r\n\r\nContrary perhaps to general opinion, the rural sections of the\r\ncountry are not conspicuously free from a public health problem. All\r\nthe squalor, bad housing and contagion is not in the crowded city\r\ntenements. Rural citizens have perhaps much more to learn about pure\r\nmilk and water, for instance, than their city brethren. But the public\r\nhealth movement has struck the country districts. It seems to have come\r\nprincipally by way of the nation wide attack on tuberculosis. During\r\nthe past six or seven years there has been a remarkable campaign for\r\ninstitutions for the care of persons afflicted with this malady. It\r\nis something entirely distinct from the idea of caring for the pauper\r\nsick, for it has been found difficult to persuade many people in need\r\nof proper treatment to go to an institution to which a long-standing\r\nstigma is attached. New York now has such special institutions in\r\nabout half of its counties. In the South, North Carolina has made\r\nmore important progress than any other state. Ninety of its hundred\r\ncounties have part-time county physicians, while the other ten have\r\ncounty health officers devoting their entire time and energies to\r\nthe preservation of public health and the prevention of disease. The\r\nstandard for the selection of these officers is very high.\r\n\r\nWisconsin has enacted a statute authorizing the board of supervisors of\r\nany county to employ a graduate trained nurse whose duties are:\r\n\r\n “To act as a consulting expert on hygiene for all schools not already\r\n having medical inspection either by physician or visiting nurse, to\r\n assist the superintendents of the poor in their care of the poor in\r\n the county who are in need of the services; to give instruction to\r\n tuberculosis patients and others relative to hygiene measures to be\r\n observed in preventing the spread of tuberculosis; to aid in making\r\n a report of existing cases of tuberculosis; to act as visiting nurse\r\n throughout the county and to perform such other duties as a nurse and\r\n hygienic expert as may be assigned to her by the county board.”\r\n\r\nThat the spirit of the new public health movement is taking hold to\r\nsome extent in Minnesota is the testimony of a local authority[27]:\r\n\r\n “Koochiching County has the first and only county health organization\r\n in the state. The county commissioners and the county school board\r\n there see the economy of hiring a medical man to preserve the health\r\n of the community and to keep the children in school the maximum number\r\n of days each term.\r\n\r\n “Furthermore, they have chosen a health officer with a proper point\r\n of view; one who believes that a health department should be an\r\n educational agency more than a police bureau; one who reserves the\r\n ‘police club’ for exceptional emergencies, but who is ever ready\r\n to instruct and convert. In Koochiching County the authorities are\r\n laying the foundation for a type of citizenship that is not only\r\n going to grow up healthy, but will be so well informed that it will\r\n observe sanitary laws and insist upon proper health safeguards. A\r\n county health organization similar to the one in Koochiching County,\r\n or a better one if it can be afforded, is needed in every Minnesota\r\n county, southern as well as northern, but particularly in the pioneer\r\n district.”\r\n\r\nThe public health movement in counties is by no means limited to the\r\ncited states.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY PLANNING\r\n\r\nAn example full of suggestive possibilities for almost any locality\r\ncomes to us from Westchester County, N. Y. It is a district which\r\nis partly suburban and partly rural and has had very little unity\r\nexcepting a political one. The lines of railroad travel run not to\r\na common center within the county but to the Grand Central Terminal\r\nin New York City. This situation the Westchester County Chamber of\r\nCommerce set about to alleviate at least in some degree by means of\r\na county physical plan which would facilitate communication between\r\nsections and possibly tend to distribute population more evenly. The\r\nplan calls for a carefully thought-out system of roads, parks and\r\nsewers. It is a private undertaking, but _cities_ have official\r\nplanning commissions; why not counties? What could better serve as the\r\nstarting point for a broad, comprehensive program for a modernized\r\ncounty to undertake?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nQuite as fundamental to the welfare of the rural county as turnpikes\r\nand bridges is the awakening of its intellectual life. The school\r\nsystem is becoming everywhere more highly centralized, so that\r\neducational policies and administration are controlled from the state\r\ncapitol. But the schools only meet the demand in an elementary limited\r\nway, leaving the adult population and the graduate of the common and\r\nhigh schools for the most part unprovided for. The United States\r\nCommissioner of Education has discovered that “probably seventy per\r\ncent. of the entire population of the country have no access to any\r\nadequate collection of books or to a public reading room. In only about\r\none third of the counties of the United States is there a library of\r\nfive thousand volumes or more. In only one hundred of these do the\r\nvillages and country people have free use of the libraries.”\r\n\r\nIn 1901 an Ohio county through a legacy left by one of its citizens\r\nwas enabled to meet this deficiency at least partially by establishing\r\nthe first county library. It has grown rapidly and now has not only a\r\ncentral building but a number of sub-stations. The county is said, as a\r\nresult of this beginning, to have experienced a general awakening which\r\nhas been evidenced in good county pikes, county parks and a hundred\r\nother tangible ways.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of Ohio, county library laws were passed in\r\nWyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Maryland, Oregon, Nebraska and\r\nNew York. California has twenty-seven county libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC DEFENDER\r\n\r\nThroughout Oklahoma and in Los Angeles county a humanitarian public\r\nopinion has manifested itself in the erection of a new county office,\r\nthat of public defender. The purpose of this new institution is to\r\nput the impecunious litigant actually as well as legally on an equal\r\nfooting with his opponent, whether he be a defendant in a criminal\r\naction or a party to a civil suit. Hitherto the law had prescribed\r\nthat every defendant should have counsel, even if it be at the state’s\r\nexpense. But the lawyers assigned to this somewhat thankless task\r\n(in a pecuniary sense) were either young and inexperienced or too\r\nbusy with more lucrative practice to give the “charity” cases the\r\nattention they deserved. Under the new system the salaried defender is\r\na man comparable in his ability to the district attorney; he gives his\r\nentire time to the county and has a number of assistants. The defender\r\nserves also as an investigator for the court and often in this capacity\r\ndiscovers circumstances which justify the judge in mitigating sentence.\r\nIncidentally, two years experimentation with this office in Los Angeles\r\nhas shown that a considerable saving can be made as against the old\r\nmethod of employing various lawyers in private practice.\r\n\r\nWhile the public defender will doubtless acquire greatest importance in\r\ncity counties, rural communities will not fail to provide opportunities\r\nfor his services.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IDEALIZED POORMASTER\r\n\r\nFor another piece of successful experimentation we must again revert\r\nto Westchester County, N. Y., this time to the work of V. Everit Macy,\r\nthe superintendent of the poor elected in November, 1914. Mr. Macy\r\nentered upon his public duties, a man of wealth and long experience in\r\nsocial welfare work. He found the poor administration of the county at\r\nits political worst: petty graft in commitments and the purchase of\r\nsupplies, an archaic almshouse, a notable absence of informing records,\r\nneglect of proper medical examinations. He began at the source of the\r\ntrouble by eliminating “politics,” in the making of appointments,\r\nby the simple expedient of requiring applicants for positions to\r\nstate their qualifications. In time he had surrounded himself with a\r\ngroup of trained social workers, men and women who, according to one\r\nobserver,[28] “are as unlike the staff commonly found with a poor-law\r\nofficer as the faculty of a university is unlike that of a one-room\r\ncountry school.” The simple recital of a few of his achievements in\r\nhis first two-year term presages, perhaps, the county of the future\r\nas somewhere in sight of its highest efficiency as a humanitarian\r\nagency. Mr. Macy systematized records, required physical and medical\r\nexamination of all inmates, weeded out mental defectives and sent them\r\nto custodial institutions, started competitive bidding in the purchase\r\nof supplies (saving $18,000 in the first year), improved the diet\r\nof inmates and their general level of health, tripled the amount of\r\nproduce raised upon the county farm, made the hospital a preventive\r\nagency instead of a place for treating cases suffering obviously from\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent’s basic interest, by the way, is the ultimate\r\ncauses and prevention of poverty, and to this end he has instituted\r\ninvestigations and records of the habits, occupations and every other\r\nmatter concerning the inmates that might throw light upon their present\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn the handling of children’s cases, his work has been particularly\r\neffective. To begin with, unnecessary commitments, which had been\r\nencouraged by the fee system prevailing in New York, have been\r\nprevented. And during the first year of the term 311 children ceased\r\nto be public charges, some of those previously committed having\r\nbeen transferred to state homes, some having been placed in foster\r\nhomes, but the far greater number, 239, having been returned to their\r\nrelatives. Inasmuch as the annual cost to the county for each committed\r\nchild was $237, the public saving accomplished through this systematic,\r\nintelligent handling of the child problem was over $17,000.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Macy’s first term had expired he had so far won the\r\nconfidence of the board of supervisors and the public in general that\r\nthey accepted plans for centralizing the public welfare work of the\r\ncounty in a great plant for which nearly $2,000,000 has already been\r\nappropriated. Within the confines of this new establishment will be\r\naccommodated the almshouse, the county hospital and the county jail.\r\nThe office of superintendent of the poor, in the meantime has been\r\nabolished (January 1, 1917) and a new officer to be known as the\r\ncommissioner of charities and correction, and having greatly extended\r\njurisdiction, will take his place.\r\n\r\nIt is a new conception which Mr. Macy has given us of the once\r\nmelancholy job of the poormaster and he has new revelations of the\r\npossibilities of his position in store.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZEN ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nBut movements for better rural health, better library facilities,\r\nbetter physical development and for a better conception of public\r\nhumane obligations do not spring out of the air. Always they are the\r\nproduct either of some personal initiative or some organized effort.\r\nDoes any county clearly lack that element of citizen leadership?\r\nThen the obvious need of the county is to bridge that gap. The rural\r\npopulation of America suffers (the word is all too weak) for the\r\nlack of a public community sense. Every “average” rural citizen is\r\na unit, he does not travel in droves--so much for his independence.\r\nOn the other hand, he has not fully learned the art of coöperation\r\nand legitimate compromise. The end of this condition, however, will\r\ndoubtless come by way of his growing realization of a community of\r\nprivate interest developed through such special organizations as\r\ncounty chambers of commerce, boards of trade and county agricultural\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nSometimes such bodies, founded with the idea of promoting a common\r\nmaterial advantage, as, for instance, by enhancing the value of local\r\nreal estate or attracting capital to local industries, discover by a\r\ngradual process that the government is an indispensable leverage to\r\nachieving the particular ends in view and that existing government is\r\na decidedly ineffectual instrument. It was through such a metamorphosis\r\nthat the Chamber of Commerce in Westchester County, N. Y., progressed\r\nin its program of county planning, to a study of and attack upon\r\nthe faulty system of taxation, to plans for a revision of county\r\ngovernment and finally to an active interest in county home rule\r\nthrough constitutional revision. County chambers of commerce are also\r\ndoing much to beat down the barriers of distrust that have existed\r\nbetween the farmer and the business man. By a commingling of the two\r\nin a common organization both have often come to an understanding of\r\ntheir mutual interest in good roads, good schools and all the other\r\nappurtenances of a developed community.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY STUDY CLUBS\r\n\r\nAn interesting effort to stimulate a healthy county consciousness\r\nthrough a different intellectual means is being undertaken in North\r\nCarolina. Under the auspices of the University of North Carolina\r\n“home-county clubs” have been established in many counties and,\r\naccording to the prospectus, the members “are bent upon intimate,\r\nthoughtful acquaintance with the forces, agencies, tendencies, drifts\r\nand movements that have made the history we study to-day, and that\r\nare making the history our children will study to-morrow.” The club\r\nstudies are mainly concerned with rural problems. Each county is\r\ncompared with itself during the last census period, “in order to learn\r\nin what particulars it has moved forward, marking time or lagging to\r\nthe rearward.” But also it is compared with other counties of the\r\nstate, in every phase of the study, in order to show its rank and\r\nstanding.... “Meanwhile the state as a whole is being set against the\r\nbig background of world endeavor and achievement.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are just a few of the signs of the broadening of rural community\r\nlife. To plan, to put before the public for discussion and approval,\r\nand to execute just such projects as these is the constructive\r\nopportunity of the county of the future. It is a program which will tax\r\nthe county’s citizenship and statesmanship. It is the county’s real\r\n“politics.”\r\n\r\n[27] Dr. I. J. Murphy of the Minnesota Public Health Association.\r\n\r\n[28] See Winthrop D. Lane, “A Rich Man in the Poor House,”\r\n_Survey_, Nov. 4, 1916.

XI. of the constitution which appears herewith.\r\n It was adopted October 10, 1911. For summary and comments see pp.\r\n 145-147 of the text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_County charters._\r\n\r\nSEC. 7½. Any county may frame a charter for its own government\r\nconsistent with and subject to the Constitution (or, having framed such\r\na charter, may frame a new one), and relating to matters authorized\r\nby provisions of the Constitution, by causing a board of fifteen\r\nfreeholders, who have been for at least five years qualified electors\r\nthereof to be elected by the qualified electors of said county at\r\na general or special election. Said board of freeholders may be so\r\nelected in pursuance of an ordinance adopted by the vote of three\r\nfifths of all the members of the board of supervisors of such county,\r\ndeclaring that the public interest requires the election of such\r\nboard for the purpose of preparing and proposing a charter for said\r\ncounty, or in pursuance of a petition of qualified electors of said\r\ncounty as hereinafter provided. Such petition, signed by fifteen per\r\ncentum of the qualified electors of said county, computed upon the\r\ntotal number of votes cast therein for all candidates for Governor at\r\nthe last preceding general election at which a Governor was elected,\r\npraying for the election of a board of fifteen freeholders to prepare\r\nand propose a charter for said county, may be filed in the office of\r\nthe county clerk. It shall be the duty of said county clerk, within\r\ntwenty days after the filing of said petition, to examine the same,\r\nand to ascertain from the record of the registration of electors of\r\nthe county, whether said petition is signed by the requisite number of\r\nqualified electors. If required by said clerk, the board of supervisors\r\nshall authorize him to employ persons specially to assist him in\r\nthe work of examining such petition, and shall provide for their\r\ncompensation. Upon the completion of such examination, said clerk\r\nshall forthwith attach to said petition his certificate, properly\r\ndated, showing the result thereof, and if, by said certificate, it\r\nshall appear that said petition is signed by the requisite number of\r\nqualified electors, said clerk shall immediately present said petition\r\nto the board of supervisors, if it be in session, otherwise at its\r\nnext regular meeting after the date of such certificate. Upon the\r\nadoption of such ordinance, or the presentation of such petition,\r\nsaid board of supervisors shall order the holding of a special\r\nelection for the purpose of electing such board of freeholders, which\r\nsaid special election shall be held not less than twenty days nor\r\nmore than sixty days after the adoption of the ordinance aforesaid\r\nor the presentation of said petition to said board of supervisors;\r\n_provided_, that if a general election shall occur in said county not\r\nless than twenty days nor more than sixty days after the adoption\r\nof the ordinance aforesaid, or such presentation of said petition to\r\nsaid board of supervisors, said board of freeholders may be elected\r\nat such general election. Candidates for election as members of said\r\nboard of freeholders shall be nominated by petition, substantially in\r\nthe same manner as may be provided by general law for the nomination,\r\nby petition of electors, of candidates for county offices, to be\r\nvoted for at general elections. It shall be the duty of said board of\r\nfreeholders, within one hundred and twenty days after the result of\r\nsuch election shall have been declared by said board of supervisors,\r\nto prepare and propose a charter for said county, which shall be\r\nsigned in duplicate by the members of said board of freeholders, or a\r\nmajority of them, and be filed, one copy in the office of the county\r\nclerk of said county and the other in the office of the county recorder\r\nthereof. Said Board of Supervisors shall thereupon cause said proposed\r\ncharter to be published for at least ten times in a daily newspaper\r\nof general circulation, printed, published and circulated in said\r\ncounty; _provided_, that in any county where no such daily newspaper\r\nis printed, published and circulated, such proposed charter shall be\r\npublished for at least three times in at least one weekly newspaper,\r\nof general circulation, printed, published and circulated in such\r\ncounty; and _provided_, that in any county where neither such daily\r\nnor such weekly newspaper is printed, published and circulated, a copy\r\nof such proposed charter shall be posted by the county clerk in three\r\npublic places in said county, and on or near the entrance to at least\r\none public schoolhouse in each school district in said county, and the\r\nfirst publication or the posting of such proposed charter shall be made\r\nwithin fifteen days after the filing of a copy thereof, as aforesaid,\r\nin the office of the county clerk. Said proposed charter shall be\r\nsubmitted by said board of supervisors to the qualified electors of\r\nsaid county at a special election held not less than thirty days nor\r\nmore than sixty days after the completion of such publication, or after\r\nsuch posting; _provided_, that if a general election shall occur in\r\nsaid county not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days after\r\nthe completion of such publication, or after such posting, then such\r\nproposed charter may be so submitted at such general election.

The\r\nRegistrar of Voters shall, within ten days after such additional papers\r\nare filed, ascertain from the records of registration, and certify\r\nwhether or not the names to such petition, including such additional\r\npapers, are still insufficient, and if insufficient, no action shall\r\nbe taken thereon; but the petition shall remain on file as a public\r\nrecord.

If\r\nrequired by the Registrar of Voters, the Board of Supervisors shall\r\nauthorize him to employ, and shall provide for the compensation of,\r\npersons necessary in the examination of said petition and supplementing\r\npetition, in addition to the persons regularly employed by him in\r\nhis office. In case the Registrar of Voters is the officer sought to\r\nbe recalled, the duties in this Article provided to be performed by\r\nhim shall be performed by the County Clerk.

On\r\nsuch ballots, under each such question there shall also be printed,\r\nif the officer sought to be recalled be an elective officer, the\r\nnames of those persons who shall have been nominated as candidates to\r\nsucceed him, in case he shall be recalled at such election; but no vote\r\nshall be counted for any candidate for said office unless the voter\r\nalso voted on the question of the recall of the person sought to be\r\nrecalled therefrom. The name of the person sought to be recalled shall\r\nnot appear on the ballot as a candidate for the office. If a majority\r\nof those voting on said question of the recall of any incumbent shall\r\nvote “No” said incumbent shall continue in said office. If a majority\r\nshall vote “Yes,” said incumbent shall thereupon be deemed removed from\r\nsuch office, upon the qualification of his successor. The canvassers\r\nshall canvass the votes for candidates for said office and declare the\r\nresult in like manner as in a regular election. If the vote at any such\r\nrecall election shall recall the officer, then the candidate who has\r\nreceived the highest number of votes for the office shall be thereby\r\ndeclared elected for the remainder of the term. In case the person who\r\nreceived the highest number of votes shall fail to qualify within ten\r\ndays after receiving the certificate of election, the office shall be\r\ndeemed vacant and shall be filled according to law. If the incumbent of\r\nan appointive office be recalled at such election, his successor shall\r\nbe appointed immediately after the canvassing of the vote.\r\n\r\nBefore any petition can be filed under this section for the recall of\r\nany person in the classified service of the county, there shall be\r\npresented to, and be passed upon by, the Civil Service Commission, a\r\ncomplaint in writing giving the grounds for and asking the removal of\r\nsuch person.

The general object of this amendment is to limit\r\n the amount of special legislation affecting counties by empowering\r\n boards of supervisors to deal with many subjects of administrative\r\n organization and detail over which at present they have no general\r\n jurisdiction. The amendment anticipates legislation under which\r\n counties by referendum would be able to adopt one of several\r\n simplified forms of government in substitution for the existing form.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\n Proposing the repeal of sections twenty-six and twenty-seven of\r\n article three, the insertion of two new sections at the beginning of\r\n article ten, to be numbered sections one and two, respectively, and\r\n the renumbering and amendment of sections one to nine, respectively,\r\n of article ten of the constitution.\r\n\r\nSection 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That sections twenty-six\r\nand twenty-seven of article three be hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n§ 2.

Such law\r\nmay authorize the selection of any county officer or officers by the\r\nelectors, by the board of supervisors or by other county officers, and\r\nprovide for the removal of officers so selected; it may confer upon the\r\nboard of supervisors such powers of local legislation, government and\r\nadministration as the legislature may deem expedient._\r\n\r\n§ 2. _There shall be in each county, except a county wholly included\r\nin a city, a board of supervisors, to be composed of such members and\r\nchosen by the electors of the county or of its several subdivisions\r\nin such manner and for such period as is or may be provided by law.\r\nIn a city which includes an entire county or two or more counties,\r\nthe powers and duties of a board of supervisors may be devolved upon\r\nthe municipal assembly, common council, board of aldermen or other\r\nlegislative body of the city._\r\n\r\n§ 3.

Sheriffs shall\r\nhold no other office and [be ineligible for the next term after the\r\ntermination of their offices. They] may be required by law to renew\r\ntheir security from time to time, and in default of giving such new\r\nsecurity, their offices shall be deemed vacant. But the county shall\r\nnever be made responsible for the acts of the sheriff. The governor\r\nmay remove any officer, in this section mentioned, within the term for\r\nwhich he shall have been elected _or appointed_; giving to such\r\nofficer a copy of the charges against him and an opportunity of being\r\nheard in his defense.\r\n\r\n§ [2]_4._ All county officers whose election or appointment is not\r\nprovided for by this constitution, shall be elected by the electors\r\nof the respective counties or appointed by the boards of supervisors,\r\nor other county authorities as the legislature shall direct.

THOMAS W. SALMON\r\n\r\n [Portion of an address delivered at the meeting of the Association of\r\n County Judges and Commissioners at Waxahachie, Texas, on February 11,\r\n 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular Poor Farm is in one of the richest counties of the\r\nstate. The taxable property of that county is assessed at more than\r\n$45,000,000. It contains no large cities (the largest has a population\r\nof 15,000), all but two per cent. of the people are native-born and\r\nthe proportion of negroes is much less than in the state as a whole.\r\nIt would be difficult indeed to find in this wide land a county more\r\nprosperous, more pleasant to live in or more truly American than this\r\none.\r\n\r\nFour miles west of the county-seat is the Poor Farm. There is a\r\nsubstantial brick building for the poor and infirm which is heated by\r\nsteam and lighted by acetylene gas. Scattered around the main building\r\nare some small wooden cabins, cheap in construction and not in very\r\ngood repair, but, on the whole, comfortable for the old people, the\r\nparalytics and the epileptics who live in them. If we could leave this\r\nPoor Farm, having seen so much and no more, we could think of it\r\nagain only with feelings of pleasure that the county’s unfortunates\r\nwere provided for so comfortably; but standing alone is an old brick\r\nbuilding in which the insane are kept and this must be visited too.\r\nIt is a gloomy place, coming out of the bright October sun, but when\r\nyour eyes become accustomed to the shadows, you see what this county\r\nhas provided for the insane who are neglected by the great mother\r\nstate. You see that there is a clear space running around three sides\r\nof the one large room which forms the entire interior of the building.\r\nIn the center and across the rear end of this room are fourteen iron\r\ncages--four extending across the rear and ten back to back, down the\r\ncenter. They are made of iron bars, the tops, backs and adjoining sides\r\nbeing sheet metal. Near the top of each solid side, are seven rows of\r\nholes about an inch in diameter. Their purpose is ventilation but they\r\nserve also to destroy what poor privacy these cages might otherwise\r\npossess. Each cage contains a prison cot or two swinging from the wall\r\nwhile a few have cots upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIn these cages, which are too far from the windows in the brick walls\r\nfor the sunlight to enter except during the short period each day when\r\nit shines directly opposite them, abandoned to filth and unbelievable\r\nmisery lie the insane poor of this pleasant, fertile, prosperous\r\nAmerican county. Color, age and sex have no significance in this place.\r\nAll of those distinctions which govern the lives of human beings\r\nelsewhere are merged in common degradation here.\r\n\r\nMen and women, black and white, old and young, share its horrors just\r\nalike. They are insane and that fact alone wipes out every other\r\nconsideration and every obligation except that of keeping, with food\r\nand shelter, the spark of life alight. When, at dusk, the shadows\r\ndeepen, the creatures in this place of wretchedness cower closer in the\r\ncorners of their cages for there are no cheerful lights here as in the\r\nother buildings and when the darkness blots out everything there are\r\nonly the moans of distressed human beings to tell you it is not a tomb.\r\nThrough the night, when persons with bodily illnesses are attended by\r\nquietly treading nurses in the two fine hospitals which the nearby town\r\nsupports, these unfortunate men and women, who are sick in mind as well\r\nas in body, drag through terrors which no human community would wish to\r\nhave its worst criminals experience.\r\n\r\nEach day brings to the poor creatures here light and food--as it does\r\nto the cattle in the sheds--but it does not bring to them the slightest\r\nhope of intelligent care, nor, to most of them, even the narrow liberty\r\nof the iron-fenced yard. One attendant, a cheerful young man, is\r\nemployed by the county to look after the forty-odd inmates who at the\r\nleast compose the Poor Farm population. He used to be a trolley car\r\nconductor but now he receives forty dollars a month for attending to\r\nthe inmates, male and female, who cannot care for themselves. He brings\r\nback the feeble-minded when they wander off, he finds epileptics when\r\nthey fall in their attacks and he sees that all are fed. He is called\r\nthe “yard-man”; his duties are those of a herdsman for human beings.\r\nHis predecessor, a man of about sixty years of age, is serving a term\r\nin the state penitentiary for an attack upon a little girl who was an\r\ninmate of this Poor Farm. At his trial it was brought out that he had\r\nserved a previous term in another state for a similar offense.\r\n\r\nThe present “yard-man” has not the slightest knowledge of any other\r\nkind of treatment for the insane, nor has he had the slightest\r\nexperience in practical nursing or in caring for the mentally or\r\nphysically helpless. He has been employed here about a year. He found\r\nthe insane in these cages and he knows of no other way of keeping them.\r\nAll but three or four of them remain in their cages all day, crouching\r\non the stone floors instead of on the green grass outside. A feeble\r\nwhite woman in bed, wasted and pale, who apparently has but a few\r\nmonths to live, was pointed out in one of the cages and the “yard-man”\r\nwas asked if she would run away if she were permitted to have her bed\r\noutside. He admitted that it was not likely but said that she was weak\r\nand would fall out of bed. He was asked if it would be worse to fall\r\nout of bed on the grass or on the wooden floor of the main building\r\nthan on the stone floor of her cage, but these matters were far outside\r\nhis experience and he had no reply to make.\r\n\r\nHow much more knowledge and experience would have been required of this\r\nyoung man if the county had seen fit to maintain a menagerie! No one\r\nwould think of entrusting the animals to one so wholly inexperienced\r\nin their care. This young man might be employed as an assistant, but\r\nhe would never be placed in charge of an animal house full of valuable\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nDo not make the mistake of thinking that the wretched people who are\r\nconfined in these cages were selected from a larger number of insane\r\ninmates of the Poor Farm on account of exceptional intractability\r\nor because their brains have been so dulled by the final stages of\r\ndementia that they are no longer conscious of their surroundings.\r\nThese people are not a few selected for such reasons; they constitute\r\nall but one of the avowedly insane who are housed in this Poor Farm.\r\nThey include persons as appreciative as you or I would be of the\r\nloathesomeness of their surroundings and of the personal humiliation of\r\nbeing confined in such a place. In one cage is a man who has delusions\r\nwhich doubtless make it unsafe for him to have his liberty in the\r\ncommunity. He has not been allowed outside his cage _for a single\r\nhour_ in three years.\r\n\r\nThis place was built twenty years ago. Perhaps the brain which planned\r\nit is now dust, nevertheless its ignorant conception of the nature of\r\nmental disease still determines the kind of care this county affords\r\nthe most unfortunate of all its helpless sick. Perhaps, too, the hands\r\nwhich laid these bricks and forged these iron bars are now dead,\r\nnevertheless they still stretch out of the past and crush the living\r\nin their cruel grasp. The conception of mental diseases which gave to\r\nthis county this dreadful place did not even reflect the enlightenment\r\nof its own period. Eighty years earlier Esquirol had stirred the pity\r\nof France by a recital of miseries no worse than those which you can\r\nsee in this county to-day. Many years before this place was built,\r\nConolly had aroused public opinion in England to such an extent that\r\nit was possible for cages such as these to exist in only the darkest\r\ncorners of the land. Thirty years before this grim structure arose\r\nfrom the fair soil of Texas, Dorothea Dix was showing the inhumanity\r\nof almshouse care of the insane in this country and members of our\r\nlegislatures were profoundly stirred by her descriptions of conditions\r\nless abhorrent than those which exist to-day in the Poor Farm which\r\nI have just described. Great reforms in the care of the insane have\r\nextended over the entire country ever since these walls were built\r\nbut they have left this place untouched and it stands to-day, not\r\na pathetic but disused reminder of the ignorance and inhumanity of\r\nanother age and of another kind of civilization, but an actual, living\r\nreality reproducing, with scarcely a detail lacking, conditions which\r\nwere described in pitying terms by the writers of four centuries ago.\r\n\r\nStanding in the doorway of this building you can see evidences of the\r\nmaterial greatness of the twentieth century; taking a single step\r\ninside you can see exactly what the superstition, fear and ignorance of\r\nthe sixteenth century imposed upon the insane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSANE IN COUNTY JAILS\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the insane in the county Poor Farms would so stir\r\nthe compassion of the humane people of this state, could they but\r\nwalk among these fellow-citizens of theirs and witness the misery to\r\nwhich they have been abandoned, that almshouse care would not survive\r\nthe next session of the legislature. Take away, however, the meager\r\nattention given in the Poor Farms by those who, while they know nothing\r\nof mental diseases or of how to care for them, are moved by kindly\r\nimpulses and recognize that the insane are sent to them for care and\r\nnot for punishment; take away this and substitute the harsh discipline\r\nof the prison which is designed, by its painful memories, to restrain\r\nevildoers from crime. Then some picture can be formed of the lot of\r\nthese poor sick people in county jails. Almost without exception, they\r\nhave committed no crime, unless it be a crime to suffer from mental\r\nillness, but they share the lot of criminals and in many cases through\r\nthe fears of their jailers they are denied even the small liberties\r\nallowed the criminals. Men and women, white people and negroes,\r\nthose scarcely out of childhood and those filled with the pains and\r\ninfirmities of age, those with types of mental disease which would\r\nyield readily to even the simplest treatment and those doomed to mental\r\ndarkness all their days, I have seen them in the cells of the county\r\njails of Texas and learned their needs and witnessed their sufferings\r\nat first hand. I can only say that I have never witnessed such depths\r\nof misery as those in which these unfortunate people drag out the\r\nmonths and years. Death releases some--the more fortunate--but the\r\nothers continue to exist in filthy cells without that hope of release\r\nafter a definite period, which cheers the criminals whose lot they\r\nshare. The rigors of the jail are intended to impress evildoers with\r\nthe terrors of the law but with few exceptions the prisoners in county\r\njails are young men, most of them in sturdy health. It is needless to\r\npoint out how much more severe punishment confinement in such places\r\nis to the unfortunate insane, broken in health, many of them acutely\r\nconscious of the terrible wrong which their state is inflicting upon\r\nthem and the prey to delusional and hallucinatory terrors, as well as\r\nto those which depend upon actuality.\r\n\r\nIn not a few instances I found the insane in solitary confinement,\r\nsimply on account of their mental disease, while the criminals enjoyed\r\nthe companionship of their fellows. Every convention of life is swept\r\naway when these unfortunate people enter the jails. Women are bathed\r\nby men in the presence of male prisoners, persons with elusions of sin\r\nand impending punishment lie in cells which face the gallows, the weak\r\nand helpless are not even protected from physical violence, and, in\r\nmost cases, there is not the slightest semblance of personal care or\r\nnursing. The jailers feel that they have discharged their full duty if\r\nthe insane are prevented from escaping. Persons convicted of serious\r\ncrimes enter the jails, serve their sentences and regain their liberty\r\nwhile the insane, who have led upright lives and have contributed by\r\ntheir honest toil to the prosperity of their state, lie in their cells\r\nwithout hope of release. A pathetic fact is that the counties pay the\r\nsheriffs more just for feeding the poor people than their care would\r\ncost in the state hospitals for the insane. It is needless to dwell\r\nfurther on the inhumanity and the injustice of confining the insane in\r\nthe county jails. It constitutes a blot upon the honor of the state\r\nwhich every citizen would demand erased were the actual facts widely\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE COUNTY GENERALLY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books and Collections of Papers_\r\n\r\n American Academy of Political and Social Science, Philadelphia,\r\n “County Government....” (_Its_ Annals, v. 47, whole No. 136.)\r\n May, 1913. 326 pp.\r\n\r\n FAIRLIE, JOHN A., _Local Government in Counties, Towns and\r\n Villages_.
