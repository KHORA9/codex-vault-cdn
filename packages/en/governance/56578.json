This places under the discretion\r\nof the President a very extensive field of decision, and one which,\r\nirregularly exercised, would have a powerful effect on the proceedings\r\nand determinations of the House. The President must feel, weightily\r\nand seriously, this confidence in his discretion: and the necessity of\r\nrecurring, for its government, to some known system of rules, that he\r\nmay neither leave himself free to indulge caprice or passion, nor open\r\nto the imputation of them. But to what system of rules is he to recur,\r\nas supplementary to those of the Senate? To this there can be but one\r\nanswer: to the systems of regulations adopted by the government of some\r\none of the parliamentary bodies within these States, or of that which has\r\nserved as a prototype to most of them. This last is the model which we\r\nhave studied; while we are little acquainted with the modifications of it\r\nin our several States. It is deposited, too, in publications possessed\r\nby many, and open to all. Its rules are probably as wisely constructed\r\nfor governing the debates of a considerative body, and obtaining its\r\ntrue sense, as any which can become known to us; and the acquiescence\r\nof the Senate hitherto under the references to them, has given them the\r\nsanction of their approbation.\r\n\r\nConsidering, therefore, the law of proceedings in the Senate as composed\r\nof the precepts of the Constitution, the regulations of the Senate,\r\nand where these are silent, of the rules of Parliament, I have here\r\nendeavored to collect and digest so much of these as is called for in\r\nordinary practice, collating the parliamentary with the senatorial rules,\r\nboth where they agree and where they vary. I have done this, as well to\r\nhave them at hand for my own government, as to deposit with the Senate\r\nthe standard by which I judge and am willing to be judged. I could not\r\ndoubt the necessity of quoting the sources of my information; among\r\nwhich Mr. Hatsel's most valuable book is pre-eminent; but as he has\r\nonly treated some general heads, I have been obliged to recur to other\r\nauthorities, in support of a number of common rules of practice to which\r\nhis plan did not descend. Sometimes each authority cited supports the\r\nwhole passage. Sometimes it rests on all taken together. Sometimes the\r\nauthority goes only to a part of the text, the residue being inferred\r\nfrom known rules and principles. For some of the most familiar forms,\r\nno written authority is or can be quoted; no writer having supposed it\r\nnecessary to repeat what all were presumed to know. The statement of\r\nthese must rest on their notoriety.\r\n\r\nI am aware, that authorities can often be produced in opposition to\r\nthe rules which I lay down as parliamentary. An attention to dates will\r\ngenerally remove their weight. The proceedings of Parliament in ancient\r\ntimes, and for a long while, were crude, multiform, and embarrassing.\r\nThey have been, however, constantly advancing towards uniformity and\r\naccuracy; and have now obtained a degree of aptitude to their object,\r\nbeyond which little is to be desired or expected.\r\n\r\nYet I am far from the presumption of believing, that I may not have\r\nmistaken the parliamentary practice in some cases; and especially in\r\nthose minor forms, which, being practised daily, are supposed known to\r\neverybody, and therefore have not been committed to writing. Our resources\r\nin this quarter of the globe, for obtaining information on that part\r\nof the subject, are not perfect. But I have begun a sketch, which those\r\nwho come after me will successively correct and fill up, till a code of\r\nrules shall be formed for the use of the Senate, the effects of which\r\nmay be accuracy in business, economy of time, order, uniformity, and\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n$The rules and practices peculiar to the Senate are printed in small\r\ntype. Those of Parliament are in large.$\r\n\r\n\r\nA MANUAL OF PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF RULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF ADHERING TO RULES.\r\n\r\nMr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of Commons, used\r\nto say, \"It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, from\r\nold and experienced members, that nothing tended more to throw power\r\ninto the hands of administration and those who acted with the majority of\r\nthe House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from, the rules of\r\nproceeding; that these forms, as instituted by our ancestors, operated\r\nas a check, and control, on the actions of the majority; and that they\r\nwere, in many instances, a shelter and protection to the minority,\r\nagainst the attempts of power.\"\r\n\r\nSo far the maxim is certainly true, and is founded in good sense, that\r\nas it is always in the power of the majority, by their numbers, to stop\r\nany improper measures proposed on the part of their opponents, the only\r\nweapons by which the minority can defend themselves against similar\r\nattempts from those in power, are the forms and rules of proceeding, which\r\nhave been adopted as they were found necessary from time to time, and are\r\nbecome the law of the house; by a strict adherence to which, the weaker\r\nparty can only be protected from those irregularities and abuses which\r\nthese forms were intended to check, and which the wantonness of power\r\nis but too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities.--2\r\n_Hats._ 171, 172.\r\n\r\nAnd whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not, is\r\nreally not of so great importance. It is much more material that there\r\nshould be a rule to go by, than what that rule is; that there may be a\r\nuniformity of proceeding in business, not subject to the caprice of the\r\nSpeaker, or captiousness of the members. It is very material that order,\r\ndecency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body.--2\r\n_Hats._ 149. And in 1698 the Lords say the reasonableness of what is\r\ndesired is never considered by us, for we are bound to consider nothing\r\nbut what is usual. Matters of form are essential to government, and 'tis\r\nof consequence to be in the right. All the reason for forms is custom,\r\nand the law of forms is practice; the reason is quite out of doors. Some\r\nparticular customs may not be grounded on reason, and no good account\r\ncan be given of them; and yet many nations are zealous for them; and\r\nEnglishmen are as zealous as any others to pursue their old forms and\r\nmethods.--4 _Hats._ 258.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n$All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress\r\nof the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives.--_Constitution of the United States_, Article I.,\r\nSection 1.\r\n\r\nThe Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their\r\nservices, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the\r\nUnited States. _Const. U. S._, Art. I. Sect. 6.\r\n\r\nFor the powers of Congress, see the following Articles and Sections of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States:--Art. I., Sec. 4, 7, 8, 9.--Art.\r\nII., Sect. 1, 2.--Art. III., Sec. 3.--Art. IV., Sec. 1, 3, 5.--And all\r\nthe Amendments.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the members of Parliament, from small and obscure\r\nbeginnings, have been advancing for centuries, with a firm and\r\nnever-yielding pace. Claims seem to have been brought forward from time\r\nto time, and repeated till some example of their admission enabled them\r\nto build law on that example. We can only, therefore, state the point of\r\nprogression at which they now are. It is now acknowledged, 1st. That they\r\nare at all times exempted from question elsewhere, for anything said in\r\ntheir own house: that during the time of privilege, 2d. Neither a member\r\nhimself, his wife,[2] or his servants, [_familiares sui_] for any matter\r\nof their own, may be[3] arrested on mesne process, in any civil suit:\r\n3d. Nor be detained under execution, though levied before the time of\r\nprivilege: 4th. Nor impleaded, cited or subpœnaed, in any court: 5th.\r\nNor summoned as a witness or juror: 6th. Nor may their lands or goods be\r\ndistrained: 7th. Nor their persons assaulted, or characters traduced. And\r\nthe period of time, covered by privilege, before and after the session,\r\nwith the practice of short prorogations under the connivance of the\r\nCrown, amounts in fact to a perpetual protection against the course of\r\njustice. In one instance, indeed, it has been relaxed by 10 _G._ 3, c.\r\n50, which permits judiciary proceedings to go on against them. That these\r\nprivileges must be continually progressive, seems to result from their\r\nrejecting all definition of them; the doctrine being, that \"their dignity\r\nand independence are preserved by keeping their privileges indefinite;\"\r\nand that \"the maxims upon which they proceed, together with the method\r\nof proceeding, rest entirely in their own breast, and are not defined\r\nand ascertained by any particular stated laws.\"--1 _Blackstone_, 163, 164.\r\n\r\n$It was probably from this view of the encroaching character of privilege,\r\nthat the framers of our Constitution, in their care to provide that\r\nthe laws shall bind equally on all, and especially that those who make\r\nthem shall not be exempt themselves from their operation, have only\r\nprivileged \"Senators and Representatives\" themselves from the single act\r\nof arrest in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace,\r\nduring their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and\r\nin going to and returning from the same, and from being questioned in\r\nany other place for any speech or debate in either House.--Const. U. S.\r\nArt. I. Sec. 6. Under the general authority \"to makes all laws necessary\r\nand proper for carrying into execution the powers given them,\" Const.\r\nU. S. Art II. Sec. 8, they may provide by law the details which may be\r\nnecessary for giving full effect to the enjoyment of this privilege.\r\nNo such law being as yet made, it seems to stand at present on the\r\nfollowing ground:--1. The act of arrest is void, _ab initio_, 2 Stra.\r\n989.--2. The member arrested may be discharged on motion, 1 BI. 166. 2.\r\nStra. 990; or by Habeas Corpus under the Federal or State authority,\r\nas the case may be; or by a writ of privilege out of the Chancery, 2\r\nStra. 989, in those States which have adopted that part of the laws of\r\nEngland.--Orders of the House of Com. 1550, Feb. 20.--3. The arrest being\r\nunlawful, is a trespass for which the officer and others concerned are\r\nliable to action or indictment in the ordinary courts of justice, as\r\nin other cases of unauthorized arrest.--4. The court before which the\r\nprocess is returnable, is bound to act as in other cases of unauthorized\r\nproceeding, and liable also, as in other similar cases, to have their\r\nproceedings stayed or corrected by the Superior Courts.\r\n\r\nThe time necessary for going to and returning from Congress not being\r\ndefined, it will of course be judged of in every particular case by\r\nthose who will have to decide the case.$\r\n\r\nWhile privilege was understood in England to extend, as it does here, only\r\nto exemption from arrest _eundo, morando et redeundo_, the House of Commons\r\nthemselves decided that \"a convenient time was to be understood.\"--1580--1\r\n_Hats._ 99, 100. Nor is the law so strict in point of time as to require\r\nthe party to set out immediately on his return, but allows him time to\r\nsettle his private affairs, and to prepare for his journey; and does not\r\neven scan his road very nicely, nor forfeit his protection for a little\r\ndeviation from that which is most direct; some necessity perhaps\r\nconstraining him to it.--2 _Stra._ 986, 987.\r\n\r\nThis privilege from arrest, privileges of course against all process,\r\nthe disobedience is punishable by an attachment of the person; as a\r\nsubpoena ad respondendum, or testificandum, or a summons on a jury; and\r\nwith reason, because a member has superior duties to perform in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n$When a Representative is withdrawn from his seat by summons, the 47,700\r\npeople whom he represents lose their voice in debate and vote, as they\r\ndo in his voluntary absence: when a Senator is withdrawn by summons,\r\nhis State loses half its voice in debate and vote, as it does in his\r\nvoluntary absence. The enormous disparity of evil admits no comparison.\r\n\r\nSo far there will probably be no difference of opinion as to the\r\nprivileges of the two Houses of Congress; but in the following cases\r\nit is otherwise. In Dec. 1795, the House of Representatives committed\r\ntwo persons of the names of Randall and Whitney, for attempting to\r\ncorrupt the integrity of certain members which they considered as a\r\ncontempt and breach of the privileges of the House and the facts being\r\nproved, Whitney was detained in confinement a fortnight, and Randall\r\nthree weeks, and was reprimanded by the Speaker. In March, 1796, the\r\nHouse of Representatives voted a challenge given to a member of their\r\nHouse, to be a breach of the privileges of the House; but satisfactory\r\napologies and acknowledgments being made, no further proceedings were\r\nhad. The Editor of the Aurora having in his paper of Feb. 19, 1800,\r\ninserted some paragraphs defamatory to the Senate, and failed in his\r\nappearance, he was ordered to be committed. In debating the legality of\r\nthis order, it was insisted in support of it, that every man, by the law\r\nof nature, and every body of men, possesses the right of self-defence;\r\nthat all public functionaries are essentially invested with the powers\r\nof self-preservation; that they have an inherent right to do all acts\r\nnecessary to keep themselves in a condition to discharge the trusts\r\nconfided to them; that whenever authorities are given, the means of\r\ncarrying them into execution are given by necessary implication; that\r\nthus we see the British Parliament exercise the right of punishing\r\ncontempts; all the State Legislatures exercise the same power; and every\r\nCourt does the same; that if we have it not, we sit at the mercy of every\r\nintruder who may enter our doors or gallery, and by noise and tumult\r\nrender proceeding in business impracticable; that if our tranquillity\r\nis to be perpetually disturbed by newspaper defamation, it will not\r\nbe possible to exercise our functions with the requisite coolness and\r\ndeliberation; and that we must therefore have a power to punish these\r\ndisturbers of our peace and proceedings. To this it was answered, that\r\nthe Parliament and Courts of England have cognizance of contempts by\r\nthe express provisions of their law; that the State Legislatures have\r\nequal authority, because their powers are plenary; they represent their\r\nconstituents completely, and possess all their powers, except such as\r\ntheir Constitutions have expressly denied them; that the Courts of the\r\nseveral States have the same powers by the laws of their States, and\r\nthose of the Federal Government by the same State laws, adopted in each\r\nState by a law of Congress; that none of these bodies, therefore, derive\r\nthose powers from natural or necessary right, but from express law; that\r\nCongress have no such natural or necessary power, nor any powers but such\r\nas are given them by the Constitution; that that has given them directly\r\nexemption from personal arrest, exemption from question elsewhere for what\r\nis said in the House, and power over their own members and proceedings;\r\nfor these, no further law is necessary, the Constitution being the law;\r\nthat, moreover, by that article of the Constitution which authorizes them\r\n\"to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the\r\npowers vested by the Constitution in them,\" they may provide by law for\r\nan undisturbed exercise of their functions, _e. g._ for the punishment of\r\ncontempts, of affrays or tumults in their presence, &c; but, till the law\r\nbe made, it does not exist; and does not exist, from their own neglect;\r\nthat in the meantime, however, they are not unprotected, the ordinary\r\nmagistrates and courts of law being open and competent to punish all\r\nunjustifiable disturbances or defamations, and even their own sergeant,\r\nwho may appoint deputies ad libitum to aid him, 3 _Grey_, 59, 147, 255,\r\nis equal to the smallest disturbances; that, in requiring a previous law,\r\nthe Constitution had regard to the inviolability of the citizen as well\r\nas of the member; as, should one House, in the regular form of a bill,\r\naim at too broad privileges, it may be cheeked by the other, and both\r\nby the President; and also as, the law being promulgated, the citizen\r\nwill know how to avoid offence. But if one branch may assume its own\r\nprivileges without control; if it may do it on the spur of the occasion,\r\nconceal the law in its own breast, and after the fact committed make its\r\nsentence both the law and the judgment on that fact; if the offence is\r\nto be kept undefined, and to be declared only ex re nata, and according\r\nto the passions of the moment, and there be no limitation either in the\r\nmanner or measure of the punishment, the condition of the citizen will\r\nbe perilous indeed. Which of these doctrines is to prevail, time will\r\ndecide. Where there is no fixed law, the judgment on any particular\r\ncase is the law of that single case only, and dies with it. When a new\r\nand even a similar case arises, the judgment which is to make, and at\r\nthe same time apply, the law, is open to question and consideration, as\r\nare all new laws. Perhaps Congress, in the meantime, in their care for\r\nthe safety of the citizens, as well as that for their own protection,\r\nmay declare by law what is necessary and proper to enable them to carry\r\ninto execution the powers vested in them, and thereby hang up a rule for\r\nthe inspection of all, which may direct the conduct of the citizen, and\r\nat the same time test the judgments they shall themselves pronounce in\r\ntheir own case.$\r\n\r\nPrivilege from arrest takes place by force of the election; and before\r\na return be made, a member elected may be named of a committee, and\r\nis to every intent a member, except that he cannot vote until he is\r\nsworn.--_Memor._ 107, 108.--_D'Ewes_, 642. _col._ 2. 653. _col._ 1.--_Pet.\r\nMiscel.

For whatever is spoken in the House, is subject to\r\nthe censure of the House; and offences of this kind have been severely\r\npunished, by calling the person to the bar to make submission, committing\r\nhim to the Tower, expelling the House, &c.--_Scob._ 72; _Lex.

The case is first to be laid\r\nbefore the House, that it may judge of the fact, and of the grounds of the\r\naccusation, and how far forth the manner of the trial may concern their\r\nprivilege. Otherwise it would be in the power of other branches of the\r\ngovernment, and even of every private man, under pretences of treason,\r\n&c., to take any man from his service in the House; and so as many, one\r\nafter another, as would make the House what he pleaseth.--_Decision\r\nof the Commons on the King's declaring Sir John Hotham a traitor_--4\r\n_Rushw._ 586. So when a member stood indicted of felony, it was adjudged\r\nthat he ought to remain of the House till conviction.

Of which,\r\nsee many examples.--2 _Hats._ 256, 257, 258. But the communication is\r\nsubsequent to the arrest.--1 _Blackst._ 167.\r\n\r\nIt is highly expedient, says Hatsell, for the due preservation of the\r\nprivileges of the separate branches of the Legislature, that neither\r\nshould encroach on the other, or interfere in any matter depending\r\nbefore them, so as to preclude, or even influence, that freedom of\r\ndebate, which is essential to a free council. They are, therefore, not\r\nto take notice of any bills or other matters depending, or of votes that\r\nhave been given, or of speeches that have been held, by the members of\r\neither of the other branches of the Legislature, until the same have\r\nbeen communicated to them in the usual Parliamentary manner.--2 _Hats._\r\n252; 4 _Inst._ 15; _Seld. Jud._ 63. Thus the King's taking notice of the\r\nbill for suppressing soldiers depending before the House, his proposing\r\na provisional clause for a bill before it was presented to him by the\r\ntwo Houses, his expressing displeasure against some persons for matters\r\nmoved in Parliament during the debate and preparation of a bill, were\r\nbreaches of privilege.--2 _Nalson_, 743. And in 1783, December 17, it was\r\ndeclared a breach of fundamental privileges, &c. to report any opinion\r\nor pretended opinion of the King, on any bill or proceeding depending\r\nin either House of Parliament, with a view to influence the votes of\r\nthe members.--2 _Hats._ 251, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n$The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature\r\nthereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such\r\nregulations, except as to the place of choosing Senators.--_Const.

The\r\nperson first named is generally permitted to act as chairman. But this\r\nis a matter of courtesy; every committee having a right to elect their\r\nown chairman, who presides over them, puts questions, and reports their\r\nproceedings to the House.--4 _Inst._ 11, 12; _Scob._ 7; 1 _Grey_, 112.\r\n\r\nAt these committees the members are to speak standing, and not sitting,\r\nthough there is reason to conjecture it was formerly otherwise.--_D'Ewes_,\r\n630, _col._ 1; 4 _Parl.

These being reported and confirmed by the House, are then\r\nreferred to one or more select committees, according as the subject\r\ndivides itself into one or more bills.--_Scob._ 36, 44. Propositions for\r\nany charge on the people are especially to be first made in a committee\r\nof the whole.--3 _Hats._ 127. The sense of the whole is better taken in\r\ncommittee, because in all committees every one speaks as often as he\r\npleases.--_Scob._ 49. They generally acquiesce in the chairman named\r\nby the Speaker; but, as well as all other committees, have a right to\r\nelect one, some member, by consent, putting the question.--_Scob._ 36;\r\n3 _Grey_, 301. The form of going from the House into committee, is for\r\nthe Speaker on motion, to put the question that the House do now resolve\r\nitself into a committee of the whole, to take under consideration such\r\na matter, naming it. If determined in the affirmative, he leaves the\r\nchair, and takes a seat elsewhere, as any other member; and the person\r\nappointed chairman seats himself at the clerk's table.--_Scob._ 36.\r\nTheir quorum is the same as that of the House; and if a defect happens,\r\nthe chairman, on a motion and question, rises, the Speaker resumes the\r\nchair, and the chairman can make no other report than to inform the House\r\nof the cause of their dissolution. If a message is announced during a\r\ncommittee, the Speaker takes the chair, and receives it, because the\r\ncommittee cannot.--2 _Hats._ 125, 126.\r\n\r\nIn a committee of the whole, the tellers, on a division, differing as to\r\nnumbers, great heats and confusion arose, and dangers of a decision by\r\nthe sword. The Speaker took the chair, the mace was forcibly laid on the\r\ntable; whereupon, the members retiring to their places, the Speaker told\r\nthe House \"he had taken the chair without an order, to bring the House\r\ninto order.\" Some excepted against it; but it was generally approved\r\nas the only expedient to suppress the disorder. And every member was\r\nrequired, standing up in his place, to engage that he would proceed no\r\nfurther, in consequence of what had happened in the grand committee,\r\nwhich was done.--3 _Grey_, 139.\r\n\r\nA committee of the whole being broken up in disorder, and the chair\r\nresumed by the Speaker without an order, the House was adjourned. The\r\nnext day the committee was considered as thereby dissolved, and the\r\nsubject again before the House; and it was decided in the House, without\r\nreturning into committee.--3 _Grey_, 130.\r\n\r\nNo previous question can be put in a committee; nor can this committee\r\nadjourn as others may; but if their business is unfinished, they rise\r\non a question, the House is resumed, and the chairman reports that\r\nthe committee of the whole have, according to order, had under their\r\nconsideration such a matter, and have made progress therein; but not\r\nhaving time to go through the same, have directed him to ask leave to sit\r\nagain. Whereupon, a question is put on their having leave, and on the time\r\nwhen the House will again resolve itself into a committee.--_Scob._ 38.\r\nBut if they have gone through the matter referred to them, a member moves\r\nthat the committee may rise, and the chairman report their proceedings to\r\nthe House; which being resolved, the chairman rises, the Speaker resumes\r\nthe chair, the chairman informs him that the committee have gone through\r\nthe business referred to them, and that he is ready to make report when\r\nthe House shall think proper to receive it. If the House have time to\r\nreceive it, there is usually a cry of \"Now, Now,\" whereupon he makes the\r\nreport; but if it be late, the cry is, \"To-morrow, To-morrow,\" or, \"On\r\nMonday,\" &c., or a motion is made to that effect, and a question put,\r\nthat it be received to-morrow, &c.--_Scob._ 38.\r\n\r\nIn other things the rules of proceedings are to be the same as in the\r\nHouse.--_Scob._ 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF WITNESSES.\r\n\r\nCommon fame is a good ground for the House to proceed by inquiry, and\r\neven to accusation.--_Resolution of the House of Commons_, 1 _Car._ 1,\r\n1625; _Rush. Lex. Parl._ 115; 1 _Grey_, 16. 22. 92; 8 _Grey_, 21, 23,\r\n27, 45.\r\n\r\nWitnesses are not to be produced but where the House has previously\r\ninstituted an inquiry, 2 _Hats._ 102, nor then are orders for their\r\nattendance given blank.--3 _Grey_, 51. The process is a summons from\r\nthe House.--4 _Hats._ 255, 258.\r\n\r\nWhen any person is examined before a committee, or at the bar of the\r\nHouse, any member wishing to ask the person a question, must address it\r\nto the Speaker or chairman, who repeats the question to the person, or\r\nsays to him, \"You hear the question, answer it.\" But if the propriety of\r\nthe question be objected to, the Speaker directs the witness, counsel,\r\nand parties to withdraw; for no question can be moved, or put, or\r\ndebated, while they are there.--2 _Hats._ 108. Sometimes the questions\r\nare previously settled in writing before the witness enters.--2 _Hats._\r\n106, 107; 8 _Grey_, 64. The questions asked must be entered in the\r\njournals.--3 _Grey_, 81. But the testimony given in answer before the\r\nHouse is never written down; but before a committee it must be for the\r\ninformation of the House, who are not present to hear it.--7 _Grey_,\r\n52, 334.\r\n\r\nIf either House have occasion for the presence of a person in custody\r\nof the other, they ask the other their leave that he may be brought up\r\nto them in custody.--3 _Hats._ 52.\r\n\r\nA member, in his place, gives information to the House of what he knows\r\nof any matter under hearing at the bar.--_Jour. H. of C._, Jan. 22,\r\n1744, 5.\r\n\r\nEither House may request, but not command, the attendance of a member of\r\nthe other. They are to make the request by message to the other House,\r\nand to express clearly the purpose of attendance, that no improper subject\r\nof examination may be tendered to him. The House then gives leave to the\r\nmember to attend, if he choose it; waiting first to know from the member\r\nhimself whether he chooses to attend, till which they do not take the\r\nmessage into consideration. But when the Peers are sitting as a court\r\nof Criminal Judicature, they may order attendance; unless where it be\r\na case of impeachment by the Commons. There it is to be a request.--3\r\n_Hats._ 17; 9 _Grey_, 306, 406; 10 _Grey_, 133.\r\n\r\nCounsel are to be heard only on private, not on public bills; and on\r\nsuch points of law only as the House shall direct.--19 _Grey_, 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker is not precisely bound to any rules as to what bills or other\r\nmatter shall be first taken up, but is left to his own discretion, unless\r\nthe House on a question decide to take up a particular subject.--_Hakew._\r\n136.\r\n\r\nA settled order of business is, however, necessary for the government of\r\nthe presiding person, and to restrain individual members from calling\r\nup favorite measures, or matters under their special patronage, out\r\nof their just turn. It is useful also for directing the discretion of\r\nthe House, when they are moved to take up a particular matter, to the\r\nprejudice of others having a priority of right to their attention in\r\nthe general order of business.\r\n\r\n$In Senate, the bills and other papers which are in possession of the\r\nHouse, and in a state to be acted upon, are arranged every morning, and\r\nbrought on in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Bills ready for a second reading are read, that they may be referred\r\nto committees, and so be put under way. But if, on their being read, no\r\nmotion is made for commitment, they are then laid on the table in the\r\ngeneral file, to be taken up in their just turn.\r\n\r\n2. After twelve o'clock, bills ready for it are put on their passage.\r\n\r\n3. Reports in possession of the House which offer grounds for a bill,\r\nare to be taken up, that the bill may be ordered in.\r\n\r\n4. Bills or other matters before the House, and unfinished on the\r\npreceding day, whether taken up in turn, or on special order, are entitled\r\nto be resumed and passed on through their present stage.\r\n\r\n5. These matters being despatched, for preparing and expediting business,\r\nthe general file of bills and other papers is then taken up, and each\r\narticle of it is brought on according to its seniority, reckoned by the\r\ndate of its first introduction to the House. Reports on bills belong to\r\nthe dates of their bills.\r\n\r\nIn this way we do not waste our time in debating what shall be taken\r\nup: we do one thing at a time, follow up a subject while it is fresh,\r\nand till it is done with; clear the House of business, gradatim as it is\r\nbrought on, and prevent, to a certain degree, its immense accumulation\r\ntowards the close of the session.\r\n\r\nArrangement, however, can only take hold of matters in possession of the\r\nHouse. New matter may be moved at any time, when no question is before\r\nthe House. Such are original motions, and reports on bills. Such are,\r\nbills from the other House, which are received at all times, and receive\r\ntheir first reading as soon as the question then before the House is\r\ndisposed of; and bills brought in on leave, which are read first whenever\r\npresented. So, messages from the other House respecting amendments to\r\nbills, are taken up as soon as the House is clear of a question, unless\r\nthey require to be printed for better consideration. Orders of the day\r\nmay be called for, even when another question is before the House.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nORDER.\r\n\r\n$Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings; punish its members\r\nfor disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel\r\na member.--_Const._ I. 5.$\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, \"instances make order,\" _per Speaker Onslow_, 2 _Hats._\r\n144; but what is done only by one Parliament, cannot be called custom\r\nof Parliament: _by Prynne_, 1 _Grey_, 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nORDER RESPECTING PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk is to let no journals, records, accounts, or papers, be taken\r\nfrom the table, or out of his custody.--2 _Hats._ 193, 194.\r\n\r\nMr. Prynne having, at a committee of the whole, amended a mistake in a\r\nbill, without order or knowledge of the committee, was reprimanded. 1\r\n_Chand._ 77.\r\n\r\nA bill being missing, the House resolved, that a protestation should\r\nbe made and subscribed by the members, \"before Almighty God and this\r\nhonorable House, that neither myself nor any other, to my knowledge,\r\nhave taken away, or do at this present conceal a bill entitled,\" &c.--5\r\n_Grey_, 202.\r\n\r\nAfter a bill is engrossed, it is put into the Speaker's hands, and he\r\nis not to let any one have it to look into.--_Town. col._ 209.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII.\r\n\r\nORDER IN DEBATE.\r\n\r\nWhen the Speaker is seated in his chair, every member is to sit in his\r\nplace.--_Scob._ 6; _Grey_, 403.\r\n\r\nWhen any member means to speak, he is to stand up in his place, uncovered,\r\nand to address himself, not to the House, or any particular member, but\r\nto the Speaker, who calls him by his name, that the House may take notice\r\nwho it is that speaks.--_Scob._ 6; _D'Ewes_, 487, _col._ 1; 2 _Hats._\r\n77; 4 _Grey_, 66; 8 _Grey_, 108. But members who are indisposed may be\r\nindulged to speak sitting.--3 _Hats._ 75, 77; 1 _Grey_, 195.\r\n\r\n$In Senate, every member, when he speaks, shall address the chair,\r\nstanding in his place; and when he has finished, shall sit down.--_Rule_\r\n3.$\r\n\r\nWhen a member stands up to speak, no question is to be put; but he is\r\nto be heard, unless the House overrule him.--4 _Grey_, 390; 5 _Grey_,\r\n6, 143.\r\n\r\nIf two or more rise to speak nearly together, the Speaker determines\r\nwho was first up, and calls him by name; whereupon he proceeds, unless\r\nhe voluntarily sits down, and gives way to the other. But sometimes the\r\nHouse does not acquiesce in the Speaker's decision; in which case, the\r\nquestion is put, \"which member was first up?\"--2 _Hats._ 76; _Scob._ 7;\r\n_D'Ewes_, 434, _col._ 1, 2.\r\n\r\n$In the Senate of the United States, the President's decision is without\r\nappeal. Their rule is in these words:--_When two members rise at the\r\nsame time, the President shall name the person to speak; but in all\r\ncases_, the member who shall first rise and address the chair, shall\r\nspeak first.--_Rule_ 5.$\r\n\r\nNo man can speak more than once to the same bill, on the same day; or\r\neven on another day, if the debate be adjourned. But if it be read more\r\nthan once, in the same day, he may speak once at every reading.--_Co._\r\n12, 116; _Hakew._ 148; _Scob._ 58; 2 _Hats._ 75. Even a change of opinion\r\ndoes not give a right to be heard a second time.--_Smyth. Comw. L._\r\n2. _c._ 3; _Arcan. Parl._ 17.\r\n\r\n$The corresponding rule of the Senate is in these words:--No member\r\nshall speak more than twice in any one debate on the same day, without\r\nleave of the Senate.--_Rule_ 4.$\r\n\r\nBut he may be permitted to speak again to clear a matter of fact.--3\r\n_Grey_, 357, 416. Or merely to explain himself, 3 _Hats._ 73, in some\r\nmaterial part of his speech, _ib._ 75; or to the manner or words of\r\nthe question, keeping himself to that only, and not travelling into the\r\nmerits of it, _Memorials in Hakew._ 29; or to the orders of the House,\r\nif they be transgressed, keeping within that line, and falling into the\r\nmatter itself.--_Mem. Hakew._ 30, 31.\r\n\r\nBut if the Speaker rises to speak, the member standing up ought to sit\r\ndown, that he may be first heard. _Town. col._ 205; _Hale. Parl._ 133;\r\n_Mem. in Hakew._ 30, 31. Nevertheless, though the Speaker may of right\r\nspeak to matters of order, and be first heard, he is restrained from\r\nspeaking on any other subject, except where the House have occasion for\r\nfacts within his knowledge: then he may, with their leave, state the\r\nmatter of fact.--3 _Grey_, 38.\r\n\r\nNo one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously\r\nor tediously.--_Scob._ 31, 33; 2 _Hats._ 166, 168; _Hale, Parl._ 133.\r\n\r\nNo person is to use indecent language against the proceedings of the\r\nHouse, no prior determination of which is to be reflected on by any\r\nmember unless he means to conclude with a motion to rescind it.--2 _Hats._\r\n169, 170; _Rushw._ p. 3. v. 1. fol. 42. But while a proposition is under\r\nconsideration, is still in fieri, though it has even been reported by a\r\ncommittee, reflections on it are no reflections on the House.--9 _Grey_,\r\n308.\r\n\r\nNo person in speaking, is to mention a member then present by his\r\nname; but to describe him by his seat in the House, or who spoke last\r\nor on the other side of the question, &c. _Mem. in Hawk._--3 _Smyth's\r\nComw., L._ 2. _c._ 3; nor to digress from the matter to fall upon the\r\nperson.--_Scob._ 31; _Hale, Parl._ 133; 2 _Hats._ 166, by speaking,\r\nreviling, nipping, or unmannerly words against a particular member.\r\n_Smyth's Comw. L._ 2. _c._ 3. The consequence of a measure may be\r\nreprobated in strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who\r\npropose or advocate it, is a personality, and against order. Qui\r\ndigreditur a materia ad personam, Mr. Speaker ought to suppress.--_Ord.\r\nCom._ 1604, Apr. 19.\r\n\r\n$When a member shall be called to order he shall sit down, until the\r\nPresident shall have determined whether he is in order or not.--_Rule_\r\n16.\r\n\r\nNo member shall speak to another, or otherwise interrupt the business\r\nof the Senate, or read any printed paper while the Journals or public\r\npapers are reading, or when any member is speaking in any debate.--_Rule_\r\n2.\r\n\r\nNo one is to disturb another in his speech, by hissing, coughing,\r\nspitting,--6 _Grey_, 332; _Scob._ 8; _D'Ewes_, 332, _col._ 1; nor stand\r\nup to interrupt him,--_Town. col._ 205; _Mem. in Hakew._ 31; nor to\r\npass between the Speaker and the speaking member; nor to go across the\r\nHouse,--_Scob._ 6; or to walk up and down it; or to take books or papers\r\nfrom the table, or write there.--2 _Hats._ 171.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if a member finds it is not the inclination of the House to\r\nhear him, and that, by conversation or any other noise, they endeavor to\r\ndrown his voice, it is the most prudent way to submit to the pleasure of\r\nthe House, and sit down; for it scarcely ever happens that they are guilty\r\nof this piece of ill manners without sufficient reason, or inattentive\r\nto a member who says any thing worth their hearing.--2 _Hats._ 77, 78.\r\n\r\nIf repeated calls do not produce order, the Speaker may call by his name\r\nany member obstinately persisting in irregularity; whereupon the House\r\nmay require the member to withdraw. He is then to be heard in exculpation\r\nand to withdraw. Then the Speaker states the offence committed, and the\r\nHouse considers the degree of punishment they will inflict.--2 _Hats._\r\n169, 7, 8, 172.\r\n\r\nFor instances of assaults and affrays in the House of Commons, and the\r\nproceedings thereon, see 1 _Pet. Misc._ 82; 3 _Grey_, 128; 4 _Grey_, 328;\r\n5 _Grey_, 38; 26 _Grey_, 204; 10 _Grey_, 8. Whenever warm words or an\r\nassault have passed between the members, the House, for the protection of\r\ntheir members, requires them to declare in their place not to prosecute\r\nany quarrel,--3 _Grey_, 128, 293; 5 _Grey_, 289; or orders them to attend\r\nthe Speaker, who is to accommodate their differences, and to report to\r\nthe House,--3 _Grey_, 419; and they are put under restraint, if they\r\nrefuse, or until they do.--9 _Grey_, 234, 312.\r\n\r\nDisorderly words are not to be noticed till the member has finished\r\nhis speech.--5 _Grey_, 356; 6 _Grey_, 60. Then the person objecting to\r\nthem, and desiring them to be taken down by the clerk at the table, must\r\nrepeat them. The Speaker then may direct the clerk to take them down\r\nin his minutes. But if he thinks them not disorderly, he delays the\r\ndirection. If the call becomes pretty general, he orders the clerk to\r\ntake them down, as stated by the objecting member. They are then part\r\nof his minutes, and when read to the offending member, he may deny they\r\nwere his words, and the House must then decide by a question, whether\r\nthey are his words or not. Then the member may justify them, or explain\r\nthe sense in which he used them, or apologize. If the House is satisfied,\r\nno further proceeding is necessary. But if two members still insist\r\nto take the sense of the House, the member must withdraw before that\r\nquestion is stated, and then the sense of the House is to be taken.--2\r\n_Hats._ 199; 4 _Grey_, 170; 6 _Grey_, 59. When any member has spoken,\r\nor other business intervened, after offensive words spoken, they cannot\r\nbe taken notice of for censure. And this is for the common security of\r\nall, and to prevent mistakes, which must happen, if words are not taken\r\ndown immediately. Formerly, they might be taken down at any time the\r\nsame day.--2 _Hats._ 196; _Mem. in Hakew._ 71; 3 _Grey_, 48; 9 _Grey_,\r\n514.\r\n\r\nDisorderly words spoken in a committee, must be written down as in\r\nthe House; but the committee can only report them to the House for\r\nanimadversion.--6 _Grey_, 46.\r\n\r\n$The rule of the Senate says,--If a member be called to order for words\r\nspoken, the exceptionable words shall be immediately taken down in\r\nwriting, that the President may be better enabled to judge.--_Rule_ 17.$\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, to speak irreverently or seditiously against the King,\r\nis against order.--_Smyth's Comw. L._ 2, _c._ 3; 2 _Hats._ 170.\r\n\r\nIt is a breach of order in debate to notice what has been said on the\r\nsame subject in the other House, or the particular votes or majorities\r\non it there; because the opinion of each House should be left to its own\r\nindependency, not to be influenced by the proceedings of the other; and\r\nthe quoting them might beget reflections leading to a misunderstanding\r\nbetween the two Houses.--8 _Grey_, 22.\r\n\r\nNeither House can exercise any authority over a member or officer of\r\nthe other, but should complain to the House of which he is, and leave\r\nthe punishment to them. Where the complaint is of words disrespectfully\r\nspoken by a member of another House, it is difficult to obtain punishment,\r\nbecause of the rules supposed necessary to be observed (as to the\r\nimmediate noting down of words) for the security of members. Therefore\r\nit is the duty of the House, and more particularly of the Speaker, to\r\ninterfere immediately, and not to permit expressions to go unnoticed,\r\nwhich may give a ground of complaint to the other House, and introduce\r\nproceedings and mutual accusations between the two Houses, which can\r\nhardly be terminated without difficulty and disorder.--3 _Hats._ 51.\r\n\r\nNo member may be present when a bill, or any business concerning himself,\r\nis debating; nor is any member to speak to the merits of it till he\r\nwithdraws.--2 _Hats._ 219. The rule is, that if a charge against a member\r\narise out of a report of a committee, or examination of witnesses in\r\nthe House, as the member knows from that to what points he is to direct\r\nhis exculpation, he may be heard to those points before any question\r\nis moved or stated against them. He is then to be heard, and withdraw\r\nbefore any question is moved. But if the question itself is the charge,\r\nas for breach of order, or matter arising in debate, there the matter\r\nmust be stated, that is, the question must be moved, himself heard, and\r\nthen to withdraw.--2 _Hats._ 121, 122.\r\n\r\nWhere the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or\r\nquestion, he is to withdraw. And where such an interest has appeared, his\r\nvoice has been disallowed, even after a division. In a case so contrary\r\nnot only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamental principles of\r\nthe social compact, which denies to any man to be a judge in his own\r\ncause, it is for the honor of the House that this rule of immemorial\r\nobservance should be strictly adhered to.--2 _Hats._ 119, 121; 6 _Grey_,\r\n368.\r\n\r\nNo member is to come into the House with his head covered, nor to remove\r\nfrom one place to the other with his hat on, nor is to put on his hat\r\nin coming in, or removing, until he be sit down in his place.--_Scob._\r\n6.\r\n\r\nA question of order may be adjourned to give time to look into\r\nprecedents.--2 _Hats._ 118.\r\n\r\n$In the Senate of the United States, every question of order is to be\r\ndecided by the President, without debate; but if there be a doubt in\r\nhis mind, he may call for the sense of the Senate.--_Rule_ 16.$\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, all decisions of the Speaker may be controlled by the\r\nHouse.--3 _Grey_, 319.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII.\r\n\r\nORDERS OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nOf right, the door of the House ought not to be shut, but to be kept by\r\nporters, or sergeants-at-arms, assigned for that purpose.--_Mod. ten.\r\nParl._ 23.\r\n\r\n$By the rule of the Senate, on motion made and seconded to shut the\r\ndoors of the Senate, on the discussion of any business which may in the\r\nopinion of a member, require secrecy, the President shall direct the\r\ngallery to be cleared; and during the discussion of such motion the door\r\nshall remain shut.--_Rule_ 28.\r\n\r\nNo motion shall be deemed in order, to admit any person or persons\r\nwhatever within the doors of the Senate-chamber, to present any petition,\r\nmemorial, or address, or to hear any such read.--_Rule_ 29.$\r\n\r\nThe only case where a member has a right to insist on anything, is\r\nwhere he calls for the execution of a subsisting order of the House.\r\nHere, there having been already a resolution, any member has a right to\r\ninsist that the Speaker, or any other whose duty it is, shall carry it\r\ninto execution; and no debate or delay can be had on it. Thus any member\r\nhas a right to have the House or gallery cleared of strangers, an order\r\nexisting for that purpose; or to have the House told when there is not\r\na quorum present.--2 _Hats._ 87, 129. How far an order of the House is\r\nbinding, see _Hakew._ 392.\r\n\r\nBut where an order is made that any particular matter be taken up on\r\na particular day, there a question is to be put when it is called for,\r\nWhether the House will now proceed to that matter? Where orders of the day\r\nare on important or interesting matter, they ought not to be proceeded\r\non till an hour at which the House is usually full--(_which in Senate\r\nis at noon_.)\r\n\r\nOrders of the day may be discharged at any time, and a new one made for\r\na different day.--3 _Grey_, 48, 313.\r\n\r\nWhen a session is drawing to a close, and the important bills are all\r\nbrought in, the House, in order to prevent interruption by further\r\nunimportant bills, sometimes come to a resolution, that no new bill be\r\nbrought in, except it be sent from the other House.--3 _Grey_, 156.\r\n\r\nAll orders of the House determine with the session; and one taken under\r\nsuch an order may, after the session is ended, be discharged on a Habeas\r\nCorpus.--_Raym._ 120; _Jacob's L. D. by Ruffhead_; _Parliament_, 1 _Lev._\r\n165, _Prichard's case_.\r\n\r\n$Where the Constitution authorizes each House to determine the rule of\r\nits proceedings, it must mean in those cases, legislative, executive,\r\nor judiciary, submitted to them by the Constitution, or in something\r\nrelating to these, and necessary towards their execution. But orders and\r\nresolutions are sometimes entered in their journals, having no relation\r\nto these, such as acceptances of invitations to attend orations, to\r\ntake part in processions, &c. These must be understood to be merely\r\nconventional among those who are willing to participate in the ceremony,\r\nand are therefore, perhaps, improperly placed among the records of the\r\nHouse.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX.\r\n\r\nPETITIONS.\r\n\r\nA petition prays something. A remonstrance has no prayer.--1 _Grey_, 58.\r\n\r\nPetitions must be subscribed by the petitioners, _Scob._ 87; _L. Parl.\r\nc._ 22; 9 _Grey_, 362, unless they are attending, 1 _Grey_, 401, or\r\nunable to sign, and averred by a member.--3 _Grey_, 418. But a petition\r\nnot subscribed, but which the member presenting it affirmed to be all in\r\nthe handwriting of the petitioner, and his name written in the beginning,\r\nwas, on the question, (March 14, 1800,) received by the Senate. The\r\naverment of a member, or somebody without doors, that they know the\r\nhandwriting of the petitioners, is necessary, if it be questioned.--6\r\n_Grey_, 36. It must be presented by a member, not by the petitioners,\r\nand must be opened by him, holding it in his hand.--10 _Grey_, 57.\r\n\r\n$Before any petition or memorial, addressed to the Senate, shall be\r\nreceived and read at the table, whether the same shall be introduced\r\nby the President or a member, a brief statement of the contents of the\r\npetition or memorial shall verbally be made by the introducer.--_Rule_\r\n21.$\r\n\r\nRegularly a motion for receiving it must be made and seconded, and a\r\nquestion put, Whether it shall be received? But a cry from the House of\r\n\"Received,\" or even its silence, dispenses with the formality of this\r\nquestion: it is then to be read at the table, and disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX.\r\n\r\nMOTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen a motion has been made, it is not to be put to the question, or\r\ndebated, until it is seconded.--_Scob._ 21.\r\n\r\n$The Senate say, No motion shall be debated until the same shall be\r\nseconded.--_Rule_ 6.$\r\n\r\nIt is then, and not till then, in possession of the House. It is to be\r\nput into writing, if the House or Speaker require it, and must be read\r\nto the House by the Speaker, as often as any member desires it for his\r\ninformation.--2 _Hats._ 82.\r\n\r\n$The rule of the Senate is, When a motion shall be made and seconded, it\r\nshall be reduced to writing, if desired by the President or any member,\r\ndelivered in at the table, and read by the President before the same\r\nshall be debated.--_Rule_ 7.$\r\n\r\nIt might be asked, whether a motion for adjournment, or for the orders of\r\nthe day, can be made by one member while another is speaking? It cannot.\r\nWhen two members offer to speak, he who rose first is to be heard, and\r\nit is a breach of order in another to interrupt him, unless by calling\r\nhim to order if he departs from it. And the question of order being\r\ndecided, he is still to be heard through. A call for adjournment, or for\r\nthe order of the day, or for the question, by gentlemen from their seats,\r\nis not a motion. No motion can be made without arising and addressing\r\nthe chair. Such calls are themselves breaches of order, which, though\r\nthe member who has risen may respect as an expression of impatience of\r\nthe House against farther debate, yet, if he chooses, he has a right to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen the House commands, it is by an \"order.\" But facts, principles,\r\ntheir own opinions and purposes, are expressed in the form of resolutions.\r\n\r\n$A resolution for an allowance of money to the clerks being moved,\r\nit was objected to as not in order, and so ruled by the chair. But on\r\nappeal to the Senate, (i. e., a call for their sense by the President,\r\non account of doubt in his mind, according to Rule 16,) the decision\r\nwas overruled.--_Journ. Sen._, June 1, 1796. I presume the doubt was,\r\nwhether an allowance of money could be made otherwise than by bill.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII.\r\n\r\nBILLS.\r\n\r\n$Every bill shall receive three readings previous to its being passed;\r\nand the President shall give notice at each, whether it be the first,\r\nsecond, or third; which readings shall be on three different days, unless\r\nthe Senate unanimously direct otherwise, or unless by a joint vote of\r\nboth Houses, or the expiration of their term, the session is to be closed\r\nwithin three days.--_Rule_ 13.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIII.\r\n\r\nBILLS, LEAVE TO BRING IN.\r\n\r\n$One day's notice, at least, shall be given of an intended motion for\r\nleave to bring in a bill.--_Rule_ 12.$\r\n\r\nWhen a member desires to bring a bill on any subject, he states to the\r\nHouse, in general terms, the causes for doing it, and concludes by moving\r\nfor leave to bring in a bill, entitled, &c. Leave being given, on the\r\nquestion, a committee is appointed to prepare and bring in the bill.\r\nThe mover and seconder are always appointed on this committee, and one\r\nor more in addition.--_Hakew._ 132; _Scob._ 40.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presented fairly written, without any erasure or\r\ninterlineation; or the Speaker may refuse it.--_Scob._ 31; 1 _Grey_,\r\n82, 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIV.\r\n\r\nBILLS, FIRST READING.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is first presented, the clerk reads it at the table, and\r\nhands it to the Speaker, who, rising, states to the House the title of\r\nthe bill; that this is the first time of reading it; and the question\r\nwill be, Whether it shall be read a second time? Then, sitting down, to\r\ngive an opening for objections; if none be made, he rises again, and\r\nputs the question, Whether it shall be read a second time?--_Hakew._\r\n137, 141. A bill cannot be amended at the first reading,--6 _Grey_,\r\n286; nor is it usual for it to be opposed then, but it may be done and\r\nrejected.--_D'Ewes_, 335, _col._ 1; 3 _Hats._ 198.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXV.\r\n\r\nBILLS, SECOND READING.\r\n\r\nThe second reading must regularly be on another day.--_Hakew._ 143. It\r\nis done by the clerk at the table, who then hands it to the Speaker. The\r\nSpeaker, rising, states to the House the title of the bill, that this is\r\nthe second time of reading it, and that the question will be, Whether\r\nit shall be committed, or engrossed and read a third time? But if the\r\nbill came from the other House, as it always comes engrossed, he states\r\nthat the question will be, Whether it shall be read a third time? And\r\nbefore he has so reported the state of the bill, no one is to speak to\r\nit.--_Hakew._ 143, 146.\r\n\r\n$In the Senate of the United States, the President reports the title of\r\nthe bill, that this is the second time of reading it, that it is now to\r\nbe considered as in a committee of the whole, and the question will be,\r\nWhether it shall be read a third time? or, that it may be referred to\r\na special committee.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVI.\r\n\r\nBILLS, COMMITMENT.\r\n\r\nIf, on motion and question, it be decided that the bill shall be\r\ncommitted, it may then be moved to be referred to a committee of the whole\r\nHouse, or to a special committee. If the latter, the Speaker proceeds\r\nto name the committee. Any member also may name a single person, and\r\nthe clerk is to write him down as of the committee. But the House have\r\na controlling power over the names and number, if a question be moved\r\nagainst any one; and may in any case put in and put out whom they please.\r\n\r\nThose who take exceptions to some particulars in the bill, are to be\r\nof the committee. But none who speak directly against the body of the\r\nbill. For he that would totally destroy, would not amend it.--_Hakew._\r\n146; _Town. col._ 208; _D'Ewes_, 634, _col._ 2; _Scob._ 47; or, as is\r\nsaid, 5 _Grey_, 145, the child is not to be put to a nurse that cares\r\nnot for it.--6 _Grey_, 373. It is therefore a constant rule, \"that no\r\nman is to be employed in any matter who has declared himself against\r\nit.\" And when any member who is against the bill, hears himself named of\r\nits committee, he ought to ask to be excused. Thus, March 6, 1606, Mr.\r\nHadley was, on the question being put, excused from being of a committee,\r\ndeclaring himself to be against the matter itself.--_Scob._ 48.\r\n\r\n$No bill shall be committed or amended until it shall have been twice\r\nread, after which it may be referred to a committee.--_Rule_ 14.\r\n\r\nAll committees shall be appointed by ballot, and a plurality of voices\r\nshall make a choice.--_Rule_ 15.$\r\n\r\nThe clerk may deliver the bill to any member of the committee.--_Town._\r\n_col._ 138. But it is usual to deliver it to him who is first named.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the House has ordered the committee to withdraw immediately\r\ninto the committee-chamber, and act on and bring back the bill, sitting\r\nthe House.--_Scob._ 48.\r\n\r\nA committee meets when and where they please, if the House has not ordered\r\ntime and place for them.--6 _Grey_, 370. But they can only act when\r\ntogether, and not by separate consultation and consent; nothing being\r\nthe report of the committee, but what has been agreed to in committee,\r\nactually assembled.\r\n\r\nA majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business.--_Elsynge's\r\nmethod of passing bills_, 11.\r\n\r\nAny member of the House may be present at any select committee, but\r\ncannot vote, and must give place to all of the committee, and must sit\r\nbelow them.--_Elsynge_, 12; _Scob._ 49.\r\n\r\nBut in 1626, April 24th, the House of Commons resolved that though any\r\nmembers may be present at the examination of witnesses, they may not\r\nbe at the debate, disposition, or penning of the business by the select\r\ncommittee.--4 _Hats._ 124.\r\n\r\nThe committee have full power over the bill or other paper committed to\r\nthem, except that they cannot change the title or subject.--8 _Grey_, 228.\r\n\r\nThe paper before a committee, whether select or of the whole, may be a\r\nbill, resolutions, draught of an address, &c., and it may either originate\r\nwith them, or be referred to them. In every case, the whole paper is read\r\nfirst by the clerk, and then by the chairman, by paragraphs, _Scob._\r\n49, pausing at the end of each paragraph, and putting questions, for\r\namending, if proposed. In the case of resolutions on distinct subjects,\r\noriginating with themselves, a question is put on each separately, as\r\namended, or unamended, and no final question on the whole.--3 _Hats._ 276.\r\nBut if they relate to the same subject, a question is put on the whole.\r\nIf it be a bill, draught of an address, or other paper originating with\r\nthem, they proceed by paragraphs, putting questions for amending, either\r\nby inserting or striking out, if proposed; but no question on agreeing\r\nto the paragraphs separately. This is reserved to the close, when a\r\nquestion is put on the whole for agreeing to it as amended or unamended.\r\nBut if it be a paper referred to them, they proceed to put questions of\r\namendment, if proposed, but no final question on the whole; because all\r\nparts of the paper having been adopted by the House, stand, of course,\r\nunless altered, or struck out by a vote. Even if they are opposed to the\r\nwhole paper, and think it cannot be made good by amendments, they cannot\r\nreject it, but must report it back to the House without amendments, and\r\nthere make their opposition.\r\n\r\nThe natural order in considering and amending any paper is, to begin\r\nat the beginning, and proceed through it by paragraphs; and this order\r\nis so strictly adhered to in Parliament, that, when a latter part has\r\nbeen amended, you cannot recur back and make any alteration in a former\r\npart.--2 _Hats._ 90. In numerous assemblies, this restraint is, doubtless,\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n$But in the Senate of the United States, though in the main we consider\r\nand amend the paragraphs in their natural order, yet recurrences are\r\nindulged; and they seem, on the whole, in that small body, to produce\r\nadvantages overweighing their inconveniences.$\r\n\r\nTo this natural order of beginning at the beginning, there is a single\r\nexception found in Parliamentary usage. When a bill is taken up in\r\ncommittee, or on its second reading, they postpone the preamble, till\r\nthe other parts of the bill are gone through. The reason is, that on\r\nconsideration of the body of the bill, such alterations may therein be\r\nmade, as may also occasion the alteration of the preamble.--_Scob._ 50;\r\n7 _Grey_, 431.\r\n\r\nOn this head, the following case occurred in the Senate, March 6, 1800.\r\nA resolution which had no preamble, having been already amended by the\r\nHouse, so that a few words only of the original remained in it, a motion\r\nwas made to prefix a preamble, which, having an aspect very different\r\nfrom the resolution, the mover intimated that he should afterwards\r\npropose a correspondent amendment in the body of the resolution. It\r\nwas objected that a preamble could not be taken up till the body of the\r\nresolution is done with. But the preamble was received; because we are\r\nin fact through the body of the resolution, we have amended that as far\r\nas amendments have been offered, and indeed till little of the original\r\nis left. It is the proper time, therefore, to consider a preamble;\r\nand whether the one offered be consistent with the resolution, is for\r\nthe House to determine. The mover, indeed, has intimated that he shall\r\noffer a subsequent proposition for the body of the resolution; but the\r\nHouse is not in possession of it; it remains in his breast, and may\r\nbe withheld. The rules of the House can only operate on what is before\r\nthem. The practice of the Senate, too, allows recurrences backwards and\r\nforwards for the purpose of amendments, not permitting amendments in a\r\nsubsequent, to preclude those in a prior part, or _a converso_.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee is through the whole, a member moves that the committee\r\nmay rise, and the chairman report the paper to the House, with or without\r\namendments, as the case may be. --2 _Hats._ 289, 292; _Scob._ 53; 2\r\n_Hats._ 290; 8 _Scob._ 50.\r\n\r\nWhen a vote is once passed in a committee, it cannot be altered but by\r\nthe House, their votes being binding on themselves.--1607, June 4.\r\n\r\nThe committee may not erase, interline, or blot the bill itself; but\r\nmust, in a paper by itself, set down the amendments, stating the words\r\nthat are to be inserted or omitted, _Scob._ 50; and where, by reference\r\nto the page, line, and word of the bill.--_Scob._ 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVII.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the committee, standing in his place, informs the House\r\nthat the committee, to whom was referred such a bill, have, according to\r\norder, had the same under consideration, and have directed him to report\r\nthe same without any amendment, or with sundry amendments, (as the case\r\nmay be,) which he is ready to do when the House pleases to receive it.\r\nAnd he, or any other, may move that it be now received. But the cry of\r\n\"now, now,\" from the House, generally dispenses with the formality of\r\na motion and question. He then reads the amendments, with the coherence\r\nin the bill, and opens the alterations, and the reasons of the committee\r\nfor such amendment, until he has gone through the whole. He then delivers\r\nit at the clerk's table, where the amendments reported are read by the\r\nclerk, without the coherence; whereupon the papers lie upon the table,\r\ntill the House, at his convenience, shall take up the report.--_Scob._\r\n52; _Hakew._ 148.\r\n\r\nThe report being made, the committee is dissolved, and can act no more\r\nwithout a new power.--_Scob._ 51. But it may be revived by a vote, and\r\nthe same matter recommitted to them.--4 _Grey_, 361.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVIII.\r\n\r\nBILL, RECOMMITMENT.\r\n\r\nAfter a bill has been committed and reported, it ought not, in an ordinary\r\ncourse, to be recommitted. But in cases of importance, and for special\r\nreasons, it is sometimes recommitted, and usually to the same committee.\r\n_Hakew._ 151. If a report be committed before agreed to in the House,\r\nwhat has passed in the committee is of no validity; the whole question\r\nis again before the committee, and a new resolution must be again moved,\r\nas if nothing had passed.--3 _Hats._ 131, note.\r\n\r\nIn Senate, January, 1800, the salvage bill was recommitted three times\r\nafter the commitment.\r\n\r\nA particular clause of a bill may be committed without the whole bill,--3\r\n_Hats._ 131; or so much of a paper to one, and so much to another\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIX.\r\n\r\nBILL, REPORT TAKEN UP.\r\n\r\nWhen the report of a paper, originating with a committee, is taken\r\nup by the House, they proceed exactly as in committee. Here, as in\r\ncommittee, when the paragraphs have, on distinct questions, been agreed\r\nto _seriatim_,--5 _Grey_, 365; 6 _Grey_, 368; 8 _Grey_, 47, 104, 360;\r\n1 _Torbuck's deb._ 124; 3 _Hats._ 348,--no question need be put on the\r\nwhole report.--5 _Grey_, 381.\r\n\r\nOn taking up a bill reported with amendments, the amendments only\r\nare read by the clerk. The Speaker then reads the first, and puts it\r\nto the question, and so on till the whole are adopted or rejected,\r\nbefore any other amendment be admitted, except it be an amendment to\r\nan amendment.--_Elsynge's Mem._ 23. When through the amendments of\r\nthe committee, the Speaker pauses, and gives time for amendments to be\r\nproposed in the House to the body of the bill; as he does also if it has\r\nbeen reported without amendments; putting no question but on amendments\r\nproposed; and when through the whole, he puts the question, Whether the\r\nbill shall be read the third time?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX.\r\n\r\nQUASI-COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nIf, on the motion and question, the bill be not committed, or if no\r\nproposition for commitment be made, then the proceedings in the Senate\r\nof United States and in Parliament are totally different. The former\r\nshall be first stated.\r\n\r\n$The 20th rule of the Senate says, \"All bills, on a second reading,\r\nshall first be considered by the Senate in the same manner as if the\r\nSenate were in a committee of the whole, before they shall be taken up\r\nand proceeded on by the Senate agreeably to the standing rules, unless\r\notherwise ordered;\" that is to say, unless ordered to be referred to a\r\nspecial committee.\r\n\r\nThe proceeding of the Senate, as in committee of the whole, or in\r\nquasi-committee, are precisely as in a real committee of the whole,\r\ntaking no questions but on amendments. When through the whole, they\r\nconsider the quasi-committee as risen, the House resumed, without any\r\nmotion, question, or resolution to that effect, and the President reports,\r\nthat \"the House, acting as in committee of the whole, have had under\r\nconsideration the bill entitled, &c., and have made sundry amendments,\r\nwhich he will now report to the House.\" The bill is then before them,\r\nas it would have been if reported from a committee, and questions are\r\nregularly to be put again on every amendment: which being gone through,\r\nthe President pauses to give time to the House to propose amendments to\r\nthe body of the bill, and when through, puts the question, whether it\r\nshall be read a third time?\r\n\r\nAfter progress in amending a bill in quasi-committee, a motion may be\r\nmade to refer it to a special committee. If the motion prevails, it is\r\nequivalent in effect to the several votes that the committee rise, the\r\nHouse resume itself, discharge the committee of the whole, and refer the\r\nbill to a special committee. In that case, the amendments already made\r\nfall. But if the motion fails, the quasi-committee stands in _statu quo_.$\r\n\r\nHow far does this 20th rule subject the House, when in quasi-committee,\r\nto the laws which regulate the proceedings of a committee of the whole?\r\nThe particulars, in which these differ from proceedings in the House,\r\nare the following:--1. In a committee, every member may speak as often\r\nas he pleases.--2. The votes of a committee may be rejected or altered\r\nwhen reported to the House.--3. A committee, even of the whole, cannot\r\nrefer any matter to another committee.--4. In a committee, no previous\r\nquestion can be taken: the only means to avoid an improper discussion,\r\nis to move that the committee rise; and if it be apprehended that the\r\nsame discussion will be attempted on returning into committee, the House\r\ncan discharge them, and proceed itself on the business, keeping down the\r\nimproper discussion by the previous question.--5. A committee cannot\r\npunish a breach of order, in the House, or in the gallery,--9 _Grey_,\r\n113; it can only rise and report it to the House, who may proceed to\r\npunish.\r\n\r\n$The 1st and 2d of these peculiarities attach to the quasi-committee of\r\nthe Senate, as every day's practice proves; and seem to be the only ones\r\nto which the 20th rule meant to subject them: for it continues to be a\r\nHouse, and therefore, though it acts in some respects as a committee,\r\nin others it preserves its character as a House.--Thus, 3d, It is in\r\nthe daily habit of referring its business to a special committee--4th.\r\nIt admits the previous question: if it did not, it would have no means\r\nof preventing an improper discussion; not being able, as the committee\r\nis, to avoid it by returning into the House: for the moment it would\r\nresume the same subject there, the 20th rule declares it again a\r\nquasi-committee.--5th. It would doubtless exercise its powers as a House\r\non any breach of order.--6th. It takes a question by Yea and Nay, as the\r\nHouse does.--7th. It receives messages from the President and the other\r\nHouse.--8th. In the midst of a debate, it receives a motion to adjourn,\r\nand adjourns as a House, not as a committee.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI.\r\n\r\nBILL, SECOND READING IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, after the bill has been read a second time, if, on the\r\nmotion and question, it be not committed, or if no proposition for\r\ncommitment be made, the Speaker reads it by paragraphs, pausing between\r\neach, but putting no questions but on amendments proposed; and when\r\nthrough the whole, he puts the question, Whether it shall be read the\r\nthird time? if it came from the other House. Or, if originating with\r\nthemselves, Whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time? The\r\nSpeaker reads sitting, but rises to put a question. The clerk stands\r\nwhile he reads.\r\n\r\n$But the Senate of the United States is so much in the habit of making\r\nmany and material amendments at the third reading, that it has become\r\nthe practice not to engross a bill till it has passed. An irregular and\r\ndangerous practice; because, in this way, the paper which passes the\r\nSenate is not that which goes to the other House; and that which goes\r\nto the other House as the act of the Senate, has never been seen in\r\nSenate. In reducing numerous, difficult, and illegible amendments into\r\nthe text, the secretary may, with the most innocent intentions, commit\r\nerrors which can never again be corrected.$\r\n\r\nThe bill being now as perfect as its friends can make it, this is the\r\nproper stage for those, fundamentally opposed, to make their own attack.\r\nAll attempts at other periods are with disjointed efforts; because many\r\nwho do not expect to be in favor of the bill, ultimately, are willing to\r\nlet it go on to its perfect state, to take time to examine it themselves,\r\nand to hear what can be said for it; knowing that, after all, they have\r\nsufficient opportunities of giving it their veto. Its two last stages,\r\ntherefore, are reserved for this, that is to say, on the question, Whether\r\nit shall be engrossed and read a third time? and, lastly, Whether it\r\nshall pass? The first of these is usually the most interesting contest;\r\nbecause then the whole subject is new and engaging, and the minds of the\r\nmembers having not yet been declared by any trying vote, the issue is the\r\nmore doubtful. In this stage, therefore, is the main trial of strength\r\nbetween its friends and opponents; and it behooves every one to make up\r\nhis mind decisively for this question, or he loses the main battle; and\r\naccident and management may, and often do, prevent a successful rallying\r\non the next and last question, Whether it shall pass?\r\n\r\nWhen the bill is engrossed, the title is to be endorsed on the back,\r\nand not within the bill.--_Hakew._ 250.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII.\r\n\r\nREADING PAPERS.\r\n\r\nWhere papers are laid before the House, or referred to a committee,\r\nevery member has a right to have them once read at the table, before\r\nhe can be compelled to vote on them. But it is a great, though common\r\nerror, to suppose that he has a right, _toties quoties_, to have acts,\r\njournals, accounts, or papers, on the table, read independently of the\r\nwill of the House. The delay and interruption which this might be made\r\nto produce, evince the impossibility of the existence of such a right.\r\nThere is indeed so manifest a propriety of permitting every member to\r\nhave as much information as possible on every question on which he is to\r\nvote, that when he desires the reading, if it be seen that it is really\r\nfor information, and not for delay, the Speaker directs it to be read\r\nwithout putting a question, if no one objects. But if objected to, a\r\nquestion must be put.--2 _Hats._ 117, 118.\r\n\r\nIt is equally an error to suppose, that any member has a right, without\r\na question put, to lay a book or paper on the table, and have it read,\r\non suggesting that it contains matter infringing on the privileges of\r\nthe House.--2 _Hats._ 117, 118.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, a member has not a right to read a paper in his\r\nplace, if it be objected to, without leave of the House. But this rigor\r\nis never exercised but where there is an intentional or gross abuse of\r\nthe time and patience of the House.\r\n\r\nA member has not a right even to read his own speech, committed to\r\nwriting, without leave. This also is to prevent an abuse of time; and\r\ntherefore is not refused, but where that is intended.--2 _Grey_, 227.\r\n\r\nA report of a committee of the Senate on a bill from the House of\r\nRepresentatives being under consideration, on motion that the report of\r\nthe committee of the House of Representatives on the same bill be read\r\nin the Senate, it passed in the negative.--Feb. 28, 1793.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when papers were referred to a committee, they used to be\r\nfirst read; but of late, only the titles; unless a member insists they\r\nshall be read, and then nobody can oppose it.--2 _Hats._ 117.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n$While a question is before the Senate, no motion shall be received\r\nunless for an amendment, for the previous question, or for postponing\r\nthe main question, or to commit it, or to adjourn.--Rule 8.$\r\n\r\nIt is no possession of a bill, unless it be delivered to the clerk to\r\nbe read, or the Speaker reads the title.--_Lex. Parl._ 274; _Elsynge_,\r\n_Mem._ 85; _Ord. House Commons_, 64.\r\n\r\nIt is a general rule, that the question first moved and seconded shall\r\nbe first put.--_Scob._ 28, 22; 2 _Hats._ 81. But this rule gives way to\r\nwhat may be called privileged questions; and the privileged questions\r\nare of different grades among themselves.\r\n\r\nA motion to adjourn, simply takes place of all others; for otherwise\r\nthe House might be kept sitting against its will, and indefinitely. Yet\r\nthis motion cannot be received after another question is actually put,\r\nand while the House is engaged in voting.\r\n\r\nOrders of the day take place of all other questions, except for\r\nadjournment. That is to say, the question which is the subject of an\r\norder, is made a privileged one, _pro hac vice_. The order is a repeal\r\nof the general rule as to this special case. When any member moves,\r\ntherefore, for the orders of the day to be read, no further debate\r\nis permitted on the question which was before the House; for if the\r\ndebate might proceed, it might continue through the day, and defeat the\r\norder. This motion, to entitle it to precedence, must be for the orders\r\ngenerally, and not for any particular one; and if it be carried on the\r\nquestion, \"Whether the House will now proceed to the orders of the day?\"\r\nthey must be read and proceeded on in the course in which they stand.--2\r\n_Hats._ 83. For priority of order gives priority of right, which cannot\r\nbe taken away but by another special order.\r\n\r\nAfter these there are other privileged questions, which will require\r\nconsiderable explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that every Parliamentary assembly should have certain\r\nforms of questions, so adapted as to enable them fitly to dispose of\r\nevery proposition which can be made to them. Such are, 1. The previous\r\nquestion: 2. To postpone indefinitely: 3. To adjourn to a definite day:\r\n4. To lie on the table: 5. To commit: 6. To amend. The proper occasion\r\nfor each of these questions should be understood.\r\n\r\n1. When a proposition is moved, which it is useless or inexpedient now\r\nto express or discuss, the previous question has been introduced for\r\nsuppressing, for that time, the motion and its discussion.--3 _Hats._\r\n188, 189.\r\n\r\n2. But as the previous question gets rid of it only for that day, and\r\nthe same proposition may recur the next day, if they wish to suppress it\r\nfor the whole of that session, they postpone it indefinitely.--3 _Hats._\r\n183. This quashes the proposition for that session, as an indefinite\r\nadjournment is a dissolution, or the continuance of a suit sine die is\r\na discontinuance of it.\r\n\r\n3. When a motion is made which it will be proper to act on, but\r\ninformation is wanted, or something more pressing claims the present\r\ntime, the question or debate is adjourned to such a day within the\r\nsession as will answer the views of the House.--2 _Hats._ 81. And those\r\nwho have spoken before, may not speak again when the adjourned debate\r\nis resumed.--2 _Hats._ 73. Sometimes, however, this has been abusively\r\nused, by adjourning it to a day beyond the session, to get rid of it\r\naltogether, as would be done by an indefinite postponement.\r\n\r\n4. When the House has something else which claims its present attention,\r\nbut would be willing to reserve in their power to take up a proposition\r\nwhenever it shall suit them, they order it to lie on their table. It\r\nmay then be called for at any time.\r\n\r\n5. If the proposition will want more amendment and digestion than the\r\nformalities of the House will conveniently admit, they refer it to a\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n6. But if the proposition be well digested, and may need but few and\r\nsimple amendments, and especially if these be of leading consequence,\r\nthey then proceed to consider and amend it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, in their practice, vary from this regular gradation of forms.\r\nTheir practice, comparatively with that of Parliament, stands thus:\r\n\r\n     For the Parliamentary,             The Senate uses,\r\n     Postmt. indefinite.        --Postmt. to a day beyond the session.\r\n     Adjournment,               --Postmt. to a day within the session.\r\n                                { Postponement indefinite.\r\n     Laying on the table.       { Laying on the table.\r\n\r\nIn their 8th Rule, therefore, which declares, that while a question is\r\nbefore the Senate, no motion shall be received, unless it be for the\r\nprevious question, or to postpone, commit or amend the main question,\r\nthe term postponement must be understood according to their broad use of\r\nit, and not in its Parliamentary sense. Their rule then establishes as\r\nprivileged questions, the previous question, postponement, commitment,\r\nand amendment.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, Have these questions any privilege among themselves?\r\nor are they so equal that the common principle of the \"first moved,\r\nfirst put,\" takes place among them? This will need explanation. Their\r\ncompetitions may be as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Prev. Qu. and Postpone }    In the 1st, 2d, and 3d classes, and\r\n                        Commit }  the 1st member of the 4th class, the\r\n                         Amend }  rule \"first moved, first put,\" takes\r\n                                  place.\r\n\r\n     2. Postpone and Prev. Qu. }\r\n                        Commit }\r\n                         Amend }\r\n\r\n     3. Commit and Prev. Qu.   }\r\n                    Postpone   }\r\n                       Amend   }\r\n\r\n     4. Amend and Prev. Qu.    }\r\n                   Postpone    }\r\n                     Commit    }\r\n\r\nIn the 1st class, where the previous question is first moved, the effect\r\nis peculiar; for it not only prevents the after motion to postpone or\r\ncommit from being put to question before it, but also from being put after\r\nit. For if the previous question be decided affirmatively, to wit, that\r\nthe main question shall _now_ be put, it would of course be against the\r\ndecision to postpone or commit. And if it be decided negatively, to wit,\r\nthat the main question shall not now be put, this puts the House out of\r\npossession of the main question, and consequently there is nothing before\r\nthem to postpone or commit. So that neither voting for nor against the\r\nprevious question will enable the advocates for postponing or committing\r\nto get at their object. Whether it may be amended, shall be examined\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n2d class.--If postponement be decided affirmatively, the proposition\r\nis removed from before the House, and consequently there is no ground\r\nfor the previous question, commitment, or amendment. But if decided\r\nnegatively, that it shall not be postponed, the main question may then\r\nbe suppressed by the previous question, or may be committed or amended.\r\n\r\nThe 3d class is subject to the same observations as the 2d.\r\n\r\nThe 4th class.--Amendment of the main question first moved, and afterwards\r\nthe previous question, the question of amendment shall be first put.\r\n\r\nAmendment and postponement competing, postponement is first put, as\r\nthe equivalent proposition to adjourn the main question would be in\r\nParliament. The reason is, that the question for amendment is not\r\nsuppressed by postponing or adjourning the main question, but remains\r\nbefore the House whenever the main question is resumed; and it might\r\nbe that the occasion for other urgent business might go by, and be lost\r\nby length of debate on the amendment, if the House had it not in their\r\npower to postpone the whole subject.\r\n\r\nAmendment and commitment. The question for committing, though last moved,\r\nshall be first put; because in truth it facilitates and befriends the\r\nmotion to amend. _Scobell_ is express:--\"On a motion to amend a bill,\r\nany one may, notwithstanding, move to commit it, and the question for\r\ncommitment shall be first put.\"--_Scob._ 46.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the case of two or more of the privileged\r\nquestions contending for privilege between themselves, when both were\r\nmoved on the original or main question; but now let us suppose one\r\nof them to be moved, not on the original primary question, but on the\r\nsecondary one, _e. g._\r\n\r\nSuppose a motion to postpone, commit, or amend the main question, and\r\nthat it be moved to suppress that motion by putting the previous question\r\non it. This is not allowed, because it would embarrass questions too\r\nmuch to allow them to be piled on one another several stories high; and\r\nthe same result may be had in a more simple way, by deciding against\r\nthe postponement, commitment, or amendment.--2 _Hats._ 81, 2, 3, 4.\r\n\r\nSuppose a motion for the previous question, or commitment or amendment\r\nof the main question, and that it be then moved to postpone the motion\r\nfor the previous question, or for commitment or amendment of the main\r\nquestion: 1. It would be absurd to postpone the previous question,\r\ncommitment, or amendment, alone, and thus separate the appendage from its\r\nprincipal; yet it must be postponed separately from the original, if at\r\nall, because the 8th rule of the Senate says, that when a main question\r\nis before the House, no motion shall be received but to commit, amend, or\r\npre-question the original question, which is the parliamentary doctrine;\r\ntherefore, the motion to postpone the secondary motion for the previous\r\nquestion, or for committing or amending, cannot be received: 2. This is\r\na piling of questions one on another, which, to avoid embarrassment,\r\nis not allowed: 3. The same result may be had more simply, by voting\r\nagainst the previous question, commitment, or amendment.\r\n\r\nSuppose a commitment moved, of a motion for the previous question, or\r\nto postpone, or amend.\r\n\r\nThe 1st, 2d, and 3d reasons before stated, all hold good against this.\r\n\r\nSuppose an amendment moved to a motion for the previous question? Answer:\r\nThe previous question cannot be amended. Parliamentary usage, as well\r\nas the 9th rule of the Senate, has fixed its form to be, \"Shall the\r\nmain question be now put?\" _i. e._, at this instant. And as the present\r\ninstant is but one, it can admit of no modification. To change it to\r\nto-morrow, or any other moment, is without example and without utility.\r\nBut suppose a motion to amend a motion for postponement, as to one day\r\ninstead of another, or to a special instead of indefinite time. The\r\nuseful character of amendment gives it a privilege of attaching itself to\r\na secondary privileged motion. That is, we may amend a postponement of\r\na main question. So we may amend a commitment of a main question, as by\r\nadding, for example, \"with instruction to inquire,\" &c. In like manner,\r\nif an amendment be moved to an amendment, it is admitted. But it would\r\nnot be admitted in another degree, to wit, to amend an amendment to an\r\namendment of a main question. This would lead to too much embarrassment.\r\nThe line must be drawn somewhere; and usage has drawn it after the\r\namendment to the amendment. The same result must be sought by deciding\r\nagainst the amendment to the amendment, and then moving it again as it\r\nwas wished to be amended. In this form it becomes only an amendment to\r\nan amendment.\r\n\r\n_In filling a blank with a sum, the largest sum shall be first put to\r\nthe question, by the 18th Rule of the Senate_, contrary to the rule of\r\nParliament, which privileges the smallest sum and longest time.--5 _Grey_,\r\n179; 2 _Hats._ 8, 83; 3 _Hats._ 132, 133. And this is considered to be\r\nnot in the form of an amendment to the question, but as alternative or\r\nsuccessive originals. In all cases of time or number, we must consider\r\nwhether the larger comprehends the lesser, as in a question to what day\r\na postponement shall be, the number of a committee, amount of a fine,\r\nterm of an imprisonment, term of irredeemability of a loan, or the\r\n_terminus in quem_ in any other case. Then the question must begin _a\r\nmaximo_. Or whether the lesser includes the greater, as in question on\r\nthe limitation of the rate of interest, on what day the session shall\r\nbe closed by adjournment, on what day the next shall commence, when an\r\nact shall commence, or the _terminus a quo_ in any other case, where\r\nthe question must begin _a minimo_. The object being not to begin at\r\nthat extreme, which, and more, being within every man's wish, no one\r\ncould negative it, and yet, if we should vote in the affirmative, every\r\nquestion for more would be precluded; but at that extreme which would\r\nunite few, and then to advance or recede till you get to a number which\r\nwill unite a bare majority.--3 _Grey_, 376, 384, 385. \"The fair question\r\nin this case is not that to which and more all will agree, whether there\r\nshall be addition to the question.\"--1 _Grey_, 365.\r\n\r\nAnother exception to the rule of priority is, when a motion has been made\r\nto strike out or agree to a paragraph. Motions to amend it are to be put\r\nto the question, before a vote is taken on striking out, or agreeing to\r\nthe whole paragraph.\r\n\r\nBut there are several questions, which, being incidental to every one,\r\nwill take place of every one, privileged or not; to wit, a question of\r\norder arising out of any other question, must be decided before that\r\nquestion.--2 _Hats._ 88.\r\n\r\nA matter of privilege arising out of any question, or from a quarrel\r\nbetween two members, or any other cause, supersedes the consideration\r\nof the original question, and must first be disposed of.--2 _Hats._ 88.\r\n\r\nReading papers relative to the question before the House. This question\r\nmust be put before the principal one.--2 _Hats._ 88.\r\n\r\nLeave asked to withdraw a motion. The rule of Parliament being, that a\r\nmotion made and seconded is in possession of the House, and cannot be\r\nwithdrawn without leave, the very terms of the rule imply that leave\r\nmay be given, and, consequently, may be asked and put to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PREVIOUS QUESTION.\r\n\r\nWhen any question is before the House, any member may move a previous\r\nquestion, \"Whether that question (called the main question) shall now\r\nbe put?\" If it pass in the affirmative, then the main question is to be\r\nput immediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, either to\r\nadd or alter.--_Memor. in Hakew._ 28; 4 _Grey_, 27.\r\n\r\n$The previous question being moved and seconded, the question from the\r\nchair shall be, \"Shall the main question be now put?\" and if the nays\r\nprevail, the main question shall not then be put--_Rule_ 9.$\r\n\r\nThis kind of question is understood by Mr. Hatsell to have been introduced\r\nin 1604.--2 _Hats._ 80. Sir Henry Vane introduced it.--2 _Grey_, 113,\r\n114; 3 _Grey_, 384. When the question was put in this form, \"Shall the\r\nmain question be put?\" a determination in the negative suppressed the\r\nmain question during the session; but since the words \"now put\" are\r\nused, they exclude it for the present only. Formerly, indeed, only till\r\nthe present debate was over; 4 _Grey_, 43; but now for that day and no\r\nlonger.--2 _Grey_, 113, 114.\r\n\r\nBefore the question, \"Whether the main question shall now be put?\" any\r\nperson might formerly have spoken to the main question, because otherwise\r\nhe would be precluded from speaking to it at all.--_Mem. in Hakew._ 28.\r\n\r\nThe proper occasion for the previous question is, when a subject is\r\nbrought forward of a delicate nature as to high personages, &c., or\r\nthe discussion of which may call forth observations which might be of\r\ninjurious consequences. Then the previous question is proposed, and, in\r\nthe modern usage, the discussion of the main question is suspended, and\r\nthe debate confined to the previous question. The use of it has been\r\nextended abusively to other cases; but in these, it is an embarrassing\r\nprocedure: its uses would be as well answered by other more simple\r\nParliamentary forms, and therefore it should not be favored, but\r\nrestricted within as narrow limits as possible.\r\n\r\nWhether a main question may be amended after the previous question on\r\nit has been moved and seconded? 2 _Hatsell_, 88, says, If the previous\r\nquestion had been moved and seconded, and also proposed from the chair,\r\n(by which he means, stated by the Speaker for debate,) it has been\r\ndoubted whether an amendment can be admitted to the main question. He\r\nthinks it may, after the previous question moved and seconded; but not\r\nafter it has been proposed from the chair.\r\n\r\nIn this case he thinks the friends to the amendment must vote that the\r\nmain question be not now put, and then move their amended question,\r\nwhich being made new by the amendment, is no longer the same which\r\nhas been just suppressed, and therefore may be proposed as a new one.\r\nBut this proceeding certainly endangers the main question, by dividing\r\nits friends, some of whom may choose it unamended, rather than lose it\r\naltogether; while others of them may vote, as Hatsell advises, that the\r\nmain question be not now put, with a view to move it again in an amended\r\nform. The enemies of the main question by this manœuvre to the previous\r\nquestion, get the enemies to the amendment added to them on the first\r\nvote, and throw the friends of the main question under the embarrassment\r\nof rallying again as they can. To support his opinion, too, he makes the\r\ndeciding circumstance, whether an amendment may or may not be made, to be,\r\nthat the previous question has been proposed from the chair. But as the\r\nrule is, that the House is in possession of a question as soon as it is\r\nmoved and seconded, it cannot be more than possessed of it by its being\r\nalso proposed from the chair. It may be said, indeed, that the object of\r\nthe previous question being to get rid of a question, which it is not\r\nexpedient should be discussed, this object may be defeated by moving\r\nto amend, and, in the discussion of that motion, involving the subject\r\nof the main question. But so may the object of the previous question be\r\ndefeated by moving the amended question, as Mr. Hatsell proposes, after\r\nthe decision against putting the original question. He acknowledges,\r\ntoo, that the practice has been to admit previous amendment, and only\r\ncites a few late instances to the contrary. On the whole, I should\r\nthink it best to decide it _ab inconvenienti_; to wit, Which is most\r\ninconvenient, to put it in the power of one side of the House to defeat\r\na proposition by hastily moving the previous question, and thus forcing\r\nthe main question to be put amended? or to put it in the power of the\r\nother side to force on, incidentally at least, a discussion which would\r\nbe better avoided? Perhaps the last is the least inconvenience; inasmuch\r\nas the Speaker, by confining the discussion rigorously to the amendment\r\nonly, may prevent their going into the main question; and inasmuch also,\r\nas so great a proportion of the cases, in which the previous question\r\nis called for, are fair and proper subjects of public discussion, and\r\nought not to be obstructed by a formality introduced for questions of\r\na peculiar character.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\nOn an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the main question\r\nmay speak again to the amendment.--_Scob._ 23.\r\n\r\nIf an amendment be proposed inconsistent with one already agreed to,\r\nit is a fit ground for its rejection by the House; but not within the\r\ncompetence of the Speaker to suppress, as if it were against order. For,\r\nwere he permitted to draw questions of consistence within the vortex of\r\norder, he might usurp a negative on important modifications, and suppress\r\ninstead of subserving the legislative will.\r\n\r\nAmendments may be made so as totally to alter the nature of the\r\nproposition; and it is a way of getting rid of a proposition, by making\r\nit bear a sense different from what was intended by the movers, so that\r\nthey vote against it themselves.--2 _Hats._ 79; 4, 82, 84. A new bill\r\nmay be ingrafted, by way of amendment, on the words, \"Be it enacted,\"\r\n&c.--1 _Grey_, 190, 192.\r\n\r\nIf it be proposed to amend by leaving out certain words, it may be moved\r\nas an amendment to this amendment, to leave out a part of the words\r\nof the amendment, which is equivalent to leaving them in the bill.--2\r\n_Hats._ 80, 9. The Parliamentary question is always, Whether the words\r\nshall stand part of the bill?\r\n\r\nWhen it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph, or part of\r\none, the friends of the paragraph may make it as perfect as they can,\r\nby amendments, before the question is put for inserting it. If it be\r\nreceived, it cannot be amended afterwards, in the same stage, because\r\nthe House has, on a vote, agreed to it in that form. In like manner, if\r\nit is proposed to amend by striking out a paragraph, the friends of the\r\nparagraph are first to make it as perfect as they can by amendments,\r\nbefore the question is put for striking it out. If, on the question,\r\nit be retained, it cannot be amended afterwards; because a vote against\r\nstriking out is equivalent to a vote agreeing to it in that form.\r\n\r\nWhen it is moved to amend, by striking out certain words and inserting\r\nothers, the manner of stating the question is, first to read the whole\r\npassage to be amended, as it stands at present; then the words proposed\r\nto be struck out; next those to be inserted; and lastly, the whole\r\npassage, as it will be when amended. And the question, if desired, is\r\nthen to be divided, and put first, on striking out. If carried, it is\r\nnext on inserting the words proposed. If that be lost, it may be moved\r\nto insert others.--2 _Hats._ 80, 7.\r\n\r\nA motion is made to amend by striking out certain words, and inserting\r\nothers in their place, which is negatived. Then it is moved to strike\r\nout the same words, and to insert others of a tenor entirely different\r\nfrom those first proposed. It is negatived. Then it is moved to strike\r\nout the same words and insert nothing, which is agreed to. All this is\r\nadmissible; because to strike out and insert A, is one proposition. To\r\nstrike out and insert B, is a different proposition. And to strike out and\r\ninsert nothing is still different. And the rejection of one proposition\r\ndoes not preclude the offering a different one. Nor would it change\r\nthe case were the first motion divided by putting the question first\r\non striking out, and that negatived. For as putting the whole motion to\r\nthe question at once would not have precluded, the putting the half of\r\nit cannot do it.[4]\r\n\r\nBut if it had been carried affirmatively to strike out the words and\r\nto insert A, it could not afterwards be permitted to strike out A and\r\ninsert B. The mover of B should have notified, while the insertion of A\r\nwas under debate, that he would move to insert B. In which case, those\r\nwho preferred it would join in rejecting A.\r\n\r\nAfter A is inserted, however, it may be moved to strike out a portion\r\nof the original paragraph, comprehending A, provided the coherence to\r\nbe struck out be so substantial as to make this effectively a different\r\nproposition. For then it is resolved into the common case of striking out\r\na paragraph after amending it. Nor does anything forbid a new insertion,\r\ninstead of A and its coherence.\r\n\r\nIn Senate, January 25, 1798, a motion to postpone, until the second\r\nTuesday in February, some amendments proposed to the Constitution. The\r\nwords, \"until the second Tuesday in February,\" were struck out by way\r\nof amendment. Then it was moved to add, \"until the first day of June.\"\r\nObjected, that it was not in order, as the question should first be\r\nput on the longest time; therefore, a shorter time decided against, a\r\nlonger cannot be put to question. It was answered, that this rule takes\r\nplace only in filling blanks for time. But when a specific time stands\r\npart of a motion, that may be struck out as well as any other part of\r\nthe motion; and when struck out, a motion may be received to insert any\r\nother. In fact, it is not till they are struck out, and a blank for the\r\ntime thereby produced, that the rule can begin to operate, by receiving\r\nall the propositions for different times, and putting the questions\r\nsuccessively on the longest. Otherwise, it would be in the power of the\r\nmover, by inserting originally a short time, to preclude the possibility\r\nof a longer. For, till the short time is struck out, you cannot insert\r\na longer; and if, after it is struck out, you cannot do it, then it\r\ncannot be done at all. Suppose the first motion has been to amend by\r\nstriking out \"the second Tuesday in February,\" and inserting, instead\r\nthereof, \"the first of June.\" It would have been regular then to divide\r\nthe question, by proposing first the question to strike out and then that\r\nto insert. Now, this is precisely the effect of the present proceeding;\r\nonly, instead of one motion and two questions, there are two motions\r\nand two questions to effect it; the motion being divided as well as the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter contained in two bills might be better put into one,\r\nthe manner is to reject the one, and incorporate its matter into another\r\nbill by way of amendment. So, if the matter of one bill would be better\r\ndistributed into two, any part may be struck out by way of amendment, and\r\nput into a new bill. If a section is to be transposed, a question must\r\nbe put on striking it out where it stands, and another for inserting it\r\nin the place desired.\r\n\r\nA bill passed by the one House, with blanks. These may be filled up by\r\nthe other, by way of amendments, returned to the first, as such, and\r\npassed.--3 _Hats._ 83.\r\n\r\nThe number prefixed to the section of a bill being merely a marginal\r\nindication, and no part of the text of the bill, the clerk regulates\r\nthat; the House or committee is only to amend the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nIf a question contain more parts than one, it may be divided into two\r\nor more questions.--_Mem. in Hakew._ 29. But not as the right of an\r\nindividual member, but with the consent of the House. For who is to\r\ndecide whether a question is complicated or not? where it is complicated?\r\ninto how many propositions it may be divided? The fact is, that the only\r\nmode of separating a complicated question is by moving amendments to it;\r\nand these must be decided by the House on a question, unless the House\r\norders it to be divided: as on the question, Dec. 2, 1640, making void\r\nthe election of the Knights of Worcester, on a motion it was resolved\r\nto make two questions of it, to wit, one on each Knight.--2 _Hats._\r\n85, 86. So, wherever there are several names in a question, they may\r\nbe divided, and put one by one.--9 _Grey_, 444. So, 1729, April 17,\r\non an objection that a question was complicated, it was separated by\r\namendment.--2 _Hats._ 79. 5.\r\n\r\n$The soundness of these observations will be evident from the\r\nembarrassments produced by the 10th rule of the Senate, which says, \"If\r\nthe question in debate contain several points, any member may have the\r\nsame divided.\"$\r\n\r\n1798, May 30, the alien bill in quasi-committee. To a section and proviso\r\nin the original, had been added two new provisos by way of amendment. On\r\na motion to strike out the section as amended, the question was desired\r\nto be divided. To do this, it must be put first on striking out either\r\nthe former proviso, or some distinct member of the section. But when\r\nnothing remains but the last member of the section, and the provisos, they\r\ncannot be divided so as to put the last member to question by itself;\r\nfor the provisos might thus be left standing alone as exceptions to a\r\nrule when the rule is taken away: or the new provisos might be left to\r\na second question, after having been decided on once before at the same\r\nreading; which is contrary to rule. But the question must be on striking\r\nout the last member of the section as amended. This sweeps away the\r\nexceptions with the rule, and relieves from inconsistence. A question to\r\nbe divisible, must comprehend points so distinct and entire, that one\r\nof them being taken away, the other may stand entire. But a proviso or\r\nexception, with an enacting clause, does not contain an entire point or\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nMay 31. The same bill being before the Senate. There was a proviso, that\r\nthe bill should not extend, 1. To any foreign minister; nor, 2. To any\r\nperson to whom the President should give a passport; nor, 3. To any alien\r\nmerchant, conforming himself to such regulations as the President shall\r\nprescribe; and division of the question into its simplest elements was\r\ncalled for. It was divided into four parts, the 4th taking in the words\r\n\"conforming himself,\" &c. It was objected, that the words \"any alien\r\nmerchant\" could not be separated from their modifying words \"conforming,\"\r\n&c., because these words, if left by themselves, contain no substantive\r\nidea, will make no sense. But admitting that the divisions of a paragraph\r\ninto separate questions must be so made as that each part may stand by\r\nitself, yet the House having, on the question, retained the first two\r\ndivisions, the words \"any alien merchant\" may be struck out, and their\r\nmodifying words will then attach themselves to the preceding description\r\nof persons, and become a modification of that description.\r\n\r\nWhen a question is divided, after the question on the 1st member, the\r\n2d is open to debate and amendment: because it is a known rule, that\r\na person may rise and speak at any time before the question has been\r\ncompletely decided by putting the negative, as well as the affirmative\r\nside. But the question is not completely put when the vote has been taken\r\non the first member only. One half of the question, both affirmative\r\nand negative, still remains to be put.--See _Executive Journ._, June\r\n25, 1795. The same decision by President Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCO-EXISTING QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether the House can be in possession of two motions\r\nor propositions at the same time? So that, one of them being decided,\r\nthe other goes to question without being moved anew? The answer must\r\nbe special. When a question is interrupted by a vote of adjournment,\r\nit is thereby removed from before the House; and does not stand _ipso\r\nfacto_ before them at their next meeting, but must come forward in the\r\nusual way: so, when it is interrupted by the order of the day. Such\r\nother privileged questions also as dispose of the main question (_e.\r\ng._ the previous question, the postponement, or commitment) remove it\r\nfrom before the House. But it is only suspended by a motion to amend,\r\nto withdraw, to read papers, or by a question of order or privilege, and\r\nstands again before the House when these are decided. None but the class\r\nof privileged questions can be brought forward while there is another\r\nquestion before the House; the rule being, that when a motion has been\r\nmade and seconded no other can be received except it be a privileged one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENT QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nIf, on a question for rejection, a bill be retained, it passes of course\r\nto its next reading.--_Hakew._ 141. _Scob._ 42, and a question for a\r\nsecond reading determined negatively, is a rejection without farther\r\nquestion.--4 _Grey_, 149. And see _Elsynge's Memor._ 42, in what case\r\nquestions are to be taken for rejection.\r\n\r\nWhere questions are perfectly equivalent, so that the negative of the one\r\namounts to the affirmative of the other, and leaves no other alternative,\r\nthe decision of the one concludes necessarily the other.--4 _Grey_,\r\n157. Thus the negative of striking out amounts to the affirmative of\r\nagreeing; and therefore to put a question on agreeing after that on\r\nstriking out, would be to put the same question in effect twice over.\r\nNot so in questions of amendments between the two Houses. A motion to\r\nrecede being negatived, does not amount to a positive vote to insist,\r\nbecause there is another alternative, to wit, to adhere.\r\n\r\nA bill originating in one House, is passed by the other with an amendment.\r\nA motion in the originating House, to agree to the amendment, is\r\nnegatived. Do these result from this vote of disagreement? or must the\r\nquestion on disagreement be expressly voted? The questions respecting\r\namendments from another House are, 1st. To agree: 2d. Disagree: 3d.\r\nRecede: 4th. Insist: 5th. Adhere.\r\n\r\n     1st. To agree.   }   Either of these concludes the other necessarily,\r\n     2d. To disagree. } for the positive of either is exactly the\r\n                        equivalent of the negative of the other, and\r\n                        no other alternative remains. On either motion,\r\n                        amendments to the amendment may be\r\n                        proposed; _e. g._ if it be moved to disagree,\r\n                        those who are for the amendment have a\r\n                        right to propose amendments, and to make it\r\n                        as perfect as they can, before the question of\r\n                        disagreeing is put.\r\n\r\n     3d. To recede.   }   You may then either insist or adhere. You\r\n     4th. To insist.  } may then either recede or adhere. You may\r\n     5th. To adhere.  } then either recede or insist. Consequently,\r\n                        the negative of these is not equivalent to a\r\n                        positive vote the other way. It does not raise\r\n                        so necessary an implication as may authorize\r\n                        the secretary by inference to enter another\r\n                        vote; for two alternatives still remain, either\r\n                        of which may be adopted by the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe question is to be put first on the affirmative, and then on the\r\nnegative side.\r\n\r\nAfter the Speaker has put the affirmative part of the question, any\r\nmember who has not spoken before the question, may rise and speak before\r\nthe negative be put. Because it is no full question till the negative\r\npart be put.--_Scob._ 23; _Hats._ 73.\r\n\r\nBut in small matters, and which are of course, such as receiving\r\npetitions, reports, withdrawing motions, reading papers, &c., the Speaker\r\nmost commonly supposes the consent of the House, where no objection is\r\nexpressed, and does not give them the trouble of putting the question\r\nformally.--_Scob._ 22; 2 _Hats._ 87. 2. 87; 5 _Grey_, 129; 9 _Grey_, 301.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XL.\r\n\r\nBILL, THIRD READING.\r\n\r\nTo prevent bills from being passed by surprise, the House, by a standing\r\norder, directs that they shall not be put on their passage before a\r\nfixed hour, naming one at which the House is commonly full.--_Hakew._ 153.\r\n\r\n$The usage of the Senate is, not to put bills on their passage till noon.$\r\n\r\nA bill reported and passed to the third reading, cannot on that day be\r\nread the third time and passed. Because this would be to pass on two\r\nreadings on the same day. At the third reading, the clerk reads the bill,\r\nand delivers it to the Speaker, who states the title, that it is the\r\nthird time of reading the bill, and that the question will be, Whether\r\nit shall pass? Formerly, the Speaker, or those who prepared a bill,\r\nprepared also a breviate or summary statement of its contents, which\r\nthe Speaker read when he declared the state of the bill at the several\r\nreadings. Sometimes, however, he read the bill itself, especially on its\r\npassage.--_Hakew._ 136, 137, 153; _Coke_, 22, 115. Latterly, instead of\r\nthis, he, at the third reading, states the whole contents of the bill,\r\nverbatim; only instead of reading the formal parts, \"be it enacted,\"\r\n&c., he states that \"the preamble recites so and so; the first section\r\nenacts, that, &c.; the second section enacts,\" &c.\r\n\r\n$But in the Senate of the United States, both of these formalities are\r\ndispensed with; the breviate presenting but an imperfect view of the\r\nbill, and being capable of being made to present a false one; and the\r\nfull statement being a useless waste of time, immediately after a full\r\nreading by the clerk; and especially as every member has a printed copy\r\nin his hand.$\r\n\r\nA bill, on the third reading, is not to be committed for the matter or\r\nbody thereof; but, to receive some particular clause or proviso, it\r\nhath been sometimes suffered, but as a thing very unusual.--_Hakew._\r\n156; thus, 27 _El._ 1584, a bill was committed on the third reading,\r\nhaving been formerly committed on the second; but it is declared not\r\nusual.--_D'Ewes_, 137, _col._ 2. 414. _col._ 2.\r\n\r\nWhen an essential provision has been omitted, rather than erase the\r\nbill, and render it suspicious, they add a clause on a separate paper,\r\nengrossed and called a rider, which is read, and put to the question\r\nthree times.--_Elsynge's Memorials_, 59; 6 _Grey_, 335; 1 _Blackst._\r\n183. For examples of riders, see 3 _Hats._ 121, 122, 124, 126. Every one\r\nis at liberty to bring in a rider without asking leave.--10 _Grey_, 52.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down as a general rule, that amendments proposed at the second\r\nreading shall be twice read, and those proposed at the third reading\r\nthrice read; as also all amendments from the other House.--_Town. col._\r\n19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.\r\n\r\nIt is with great, and almost invincible reluctance, that amendments are\r\nadmitted at this reading, which occasion erasures or interlineations.\r\nSometimes the proviso has been cut off from a bill; sometimes erased.--9\r\n_Grey_, 513.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper stage for filling up blanks; for if filled up before,\r\nand now altered by erasure, it would be peculiarly unsafe.\r\n\r\nAt this reading, the bill is debated afresh, and for the most part is more\r\nspoken to, at this time, than on any of the former readings.--_Hakew._\r\n153.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the question, Whether it should be read a third time? has\r\ndiscovered to its friends and opponents the arguments on which each side\r\nrelies, and which of these appear to have influence with the House; they\r\nhave had time to meet them with new arguments, and to put their old ones\r\ninto new shapes. The former vote has tried the strength of the first\r\nopinion, and furnished grounds to estimate the issue; and the question\r\nnow offered for its passage, is the last occasion which is ever to be\r\noffered for carrying or rejecting it.\r\n\r\nWhen the debate is ended, the Speaker, holding the bill in his hand,\r\nputs the question for its passage, by saying, \"Gentlemen, all you who\r\nare of opinion that this bill shall pass, say ay;\" and after the answer\r\nof ayes, \"All those of the contrary opinion, say no.\"--_Hakew._ 154.\r\n\r\nAfter the bill has passed, there can be no further alteration of it in\r\nany point.--_Hakew._ 159.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLI.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe affirmative and negative of the question having been both put and\r\nanswered, the Speaker declares whether the yeas or nays have it by the\r\nsound, if he be himself satisfied, and it stands as the judgment of the\r\nHouse. But if he be not himself satisfied which voice is the greater,\r\nor if, before any other member comes into the House, or before any new\r\nmotion is made, (for it is too late after that,) any member shall rise\r\nand declare himself dissatisfied with the Speaker's decision, then the\r\nSpeaker is to divide the House.--_Scob._ 24; 2 _Hats._ 140.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons is divided, the one party goes forth, and the\r\nother remains in the House. This has made it important which go forth, and\r\nwhich remain; because the latter gain all the indolent, the indifferent,\r\nand inattentive. Their general rule, therefore, is, that those who give\r\ntheir vote for the preservation of the orders of the House shall stay\r\nin, and those who are for introducing any new matter, or alteration, or\r\nproceeding contrary to the established course, are to go out. But this\r\nrule is subject to many exceptions and modifications.--2 _Rush._ p. 3,\r\nfol. 92; _Scob._ 43, 52; _Co._ 12, 116; _D'Ewes_, 505, _col._ 1; _Mem.\r\nin Hakew._ 25, 29; as will appear by the following statement of who go\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n     Petition that it be received,[5]               } Ayes.\r\n       Read,                                        }\r\n\r\n     Lie on the table,                              } Noes.\r\n     Rejected after refusal to lie on the table,    }\r\n\r\n     Referred to a committee, or farther proceeding,} Ayes.\r\n\r\n     Bill, that it be brought in,                   }\r\n     Read 1st or 2d time,                           }\r\n     Engrossed or read 3d time,                     } Ayes.\r\n     Proceeding on every other stage,               }\r\n     Committed,                                     }\r\n     To a committee of the whole,                   Noes.\r\n     To a select committee,                         Ayes.\r\n     Report of a bill to lie on table,              Noes.\r\n     Be _now_ read,                               } Ayes.\r\n     Be taken into consideration three months     } 50 P.

Then they place\r\nthemselves within the door, two on each side, and count those who went\r\nforth, as they come in, and report the number to the speaker.--_Mem. in\r\nHakew._ 26.\r\n\r\nA mistake in the report of the tellers may be rectified after the report\r\nmade.--2 _Hats._ 145. Note.\r\n\r\n$But, in both Houses of Congress, all those intricacies are avoided.\r\nThe ayes first rise, and are counted, standing in their places, by the\r\nPresident or Speaker. Then they sit, and the noes rise, and are counted\r\nin like manner.\r\n\r\nIn Senate, if they be equally divided, the Vice-President announces\r\nhis opinion, which decides.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, however, has directed that \"the yeas and nays of\r\nthe members of either House, on any question, shall, at the desire\r\nof one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.\" And again,\r\nthat in all cases of reconsidering a bill disapproved by the President,\r\nand returned with his objections, \"the votes of both Houses shall be\r\ndetermined by the yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting\r\nfor and against the bill, shall be entered on the journals of each House\r\nrespectively.\"\r\n\r\nBy the 11th rule of the Senate, when the yeas and nays shall be called\r\nfor by one-fifth of the members present, each member called upon shall,\r\nunless for special reasons he be excused by the Senate, declare openly,\r\nand without debate, his assent or dissent to the question. In taking the\r\nyeas and nays, and upon the call of the House, the names of the members\r\nshall be taken alphabetically.\r\n\r\nWhen it is proposed to take a vote by yeas and nays, the President or\r\nSpeaker states that \"The question is whether, _e. g._, the bill shall\r\npass? That it is proposed that the yeas and nays shall be entered on\r\nthe journal. Those, therefore, who desire it will rise.\" If he finds and\r\ndeclares that one-fifth have risen, he then states, that \"those who are\r\nof opinion that the bill shall pass, are to answer in the affirmative,\r\nthose of the contrary opinion, in the negative.\" The clerk then calls\r\nover the names alphabetically, notes the yea or nay of each, and gives\r\nthe list to the President or Speaker, who declares the result. In Senate,\r\nif there be an equal division, the Secretary calls on the Vice-President,\r\nwho notes his affirmative or negative, which becomes the decision of\r\nthe House.$\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, every member must give his vote the one way or\r\nthe other.--_Scob._ 24. As it is not permitted to any one to withdraw\r\nwho is in the House when the question is put, nor is any one to be told\r\nin the division who was not in when the question was put.--2 _Hats._ 140.\r\n\r\nThis last position is always true when the vote is by yeas and nays;\r\nwhere the negative as well as the affirmative of the question is stated\r\nby the President at the same time, and the vote of both sides begins\r\nand proceeds _pari passu_. It is true, also, when the question is put\r\nin the usual way, if the negative has also been put. But if it has not,\r\nthe member entering, or any other member may speak, and even propose\r\namendments, by which the debate may be opened again, and the question\r\ngreatly deferred. And, as some who have answered aye, may have been changed\r\nby the new arguments, the affirmative must be put over again. If, then,\r\nthe member entering may, by speaking a few words, occasion a repetition\r\nof the question, it would be useless to deny it on his simple call for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhile the House is telling, no member may speak, or move out of his\r\nplace; for, if any mistake be suspected, it must be told again.--_Mem.\r\nin Hakew._ 26; 2 _Hats._ 143.\r\n\r\nIf any difficulty arises in point of order, during the division, the\r\nSpeaker is to decide peremptorily, subject to the future censure of\r\nthe House, if irregular. He sometimes permits old experienced members\r\nto assist him with their advice, which they do sitting in their seats,\r\ncovered to avoid the appearance of debate; but this can only be with the\r\nSpeaker's leave, else the division might last several hours.--2 _Hats._\r\n143.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the majority decides. For the _lex majoris partis_ is\r\nthe law of all councils, elections, &c., where not otherwise expressly\r\nprovided.--_Hakew._ 93. But if the House be equally divided, \"_semper\r\npresumatur pro negante_:\" that is, the former law is not to be changed\r\nbut by a majority.--_Towns. col._ 134.\r\n\r\n$But, in the Senate of the United States, the Vice-President decides,\r\nwhen the House is divided.--_Const. U S._, Art. I. Sec. 2.$\r\n\r\nWhen, from counting the House, on a division, it appears that there is\r\nnot a quorum, the matter continues exactly in the state in which it was\r\nbefore the division, and must be resumed at that point on any future\r\nday.--2 _Hats._ 126.\r\n\r\n1606, May 1, on a question whether a member having said Yea, may\r\nafterwards sit and change his opinion? a precedent was remembered by\r\nthe Speaker, of Mr. Morris, attorney of the wards, in 39 _Eliz._, who\r\nin like case changed his opinion.--_Mem. in Hakew._ 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLII.\r\n\r\nTITLE.\r\n\r\nAfter the bill has passed, and not before, the title may be amended,\r\nand is to be fixed by a question; and the bill is then sent to the other\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIII.\r\n\r\nRE-CONSIDERATION.\r\n\r\n$When a question has been once made and carried in the affirmative or\r\nnegative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move\r\nfor the re-consideration thereof.--_Rule_ 22.\r\n\r\n1798, Jan. A bill on its second reading, being amended, and on the\r\nquestion, whether it shall be read a third time negatived, was restored\r\nby a decision to re-consider the question. Here the votes of negative\r\nand re-consideration, like positive and negative quantities in equation,\r\ndestroy one another, and are as if they were expunged from the journals.\r\nConsequently the bill is open for amendment, just so far as it was the\r\nmoment preceding the question for the third reading. That is to say,\r\nall parts of the bill are open for amendment, except those on which\r\nvotes have been already taken in its present stage. So also may it be\r\nre-committed.\r\n\r\nThe rule permitting a re-consideration of a question affixing to it no\r\nlimitation of time or circumstance, it may be asked whether there is no\r\nlimitation? If, after the vote, the paper on which it has passed has been\r\nparted with, there can be no re-consideration: as if a vote has been for\r\nthe passage of a bill, and the bill has been sent to the other House.\r\nBut where the paper remains, as on a bill rejected, when, or under what\r\ncircumstances, does it cease to be susceptible of re-consideration? This\r\nremains to be settled, unless a sense that the right of re-consideration\r\nis a right to waste the time of the House in repeated agitations of the\r\nsame question, so that it shall never know when a question is done with\r\nshould induce them to reform this anomalous proceeding.$\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, a question once carried, cannot be questioned again, at\r\nthe same session; but must stand as the judgment of the House.--_Towns._\r\n_col._ 67; _Memor. in Hakew._ 33. And a bill once rejected, another of\r\nthe same substance cannot be brought in again the same session.--_Hakew._\r\n158; 6 _Grey_, 392. But this does not extend to prevent putting the same\r\nquestions in different stages of a bill; because every stage of a bill\r\nsubmits the whole and every part of it to the opinion of the House, as\r\nopen for amendment, either by insertion or omission, though the same\r\namendment has been accepted or rejected in a former stage. So in reports\r\nof committees, _e. g._ report of an address, the same question is before\r\nthe House, and open for free discussion.--_Towns. col._ 26; 2 _Hats._\r\n98, 100, 101. So, orders of the House, or instructions to committees\r\nmay be discharged. So a bill begun in one House, sent to the other, and\r\nthere rejected, may be renewed again in that other, passed, and sent\r\nback.--_Ib._ 92; 3 _Hats._ 161. Or if, instead of being rejected, they\r\nread it once, and lay it aside, and put it off a month, they may offer in\r\nanother to the same effect, with the same or a different title.--_Hakew._\r\n97, 98.\r\n\r\nDivers expedients are used to correct the effects of this rule; as, by\r\npassing an explanatory act, if anything has been omitted or ill-expressed,\r\n3 _Hats._ 278; or an act to enforce, and make more effectual an act, &c.,\r\nor to rectify mistakes in an act, &c.; or a committee on one bill may be\r\ninstructed to receive a clause to rectify the mistakes of another. Thus,\r\nJune 24, 1685, a clause was inserted in a bill for rectifying a mistake\r\ncommitted by a clerk in engrossing a bill of reply.--2 _Hats._ 194. 6.\r\nOr the session may be closed for one, two, three, or more days, and a\r\nnew one commenced. But then all matters depending must be finished, or\r\nthey fall, and are to begin _de novo_.--2 _Hats._ 94, 98. Or a part of\r\nthe subject may be taken up by another bill, or taken up in a different\r\nway.--6 _Grey_, 316.\r\n\r\nAnd in cases of the last magnitude, this rule has not been so strictly\r\nand verbally observed as to stop indispensable proceedings altogether.--2\r\n_Hats._ 92. 98. Thus, when the address on the preliminaries of peace, in\r\n1782, had been lost by a majority of one; on account of the importance\r\nof the question, and smallness of the majority, the same question in\r\nsubstance, though with words not in the first, and which might change\r\nthe opinions of some members, was brought on again and carried: as\r\nthe motives for it were thought to outweigh the objections of form.--2\r\n_Hats._ 99, 100.\r\n\r\nA second bill may be passed, to continue an act of the same session; or\r\nto enlarge the time limited for its execution.--2 _Hats._ 95, 98. This\r\nis not in contradiction to the first act.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIV.\r\n\r\nBILLS SENT TO THE OTHER HOUSE.\r\n\r\n$All bills passed in the Senate, shall before they are sent to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, be examined by the committees respectively who\r\nbrought in such bills, or to whom the same have been last committed in\r\nSenate.--_Rule_ 23.$\r\n\r\nA bill from the other House is sometimes ordered to lie on the table.--2\r\n_Hats._ 97.\r\n\r\nWhen bills, passed in one House and sent to the other, are grounded\r\non special facts requiring proof, it is usual, either by message, or\r\nat a conference, to ask the grounds and evidence; and this evidence,\r\nwhether arising out of papers, or from the examination of witnesses, is\r\nimmediately communicated.--3 _Hats._ 48.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLV.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS BETWEEN THE HOUSES.\r\n\r\nWhen either House, _e. g._ the House of Commons, sends a bill to the\r\nother, the other may pass it with amendments. The regular progression\r\nin this case is, that the Commons disagree to the amendment; the Lords\r\ninsist on it; the Commons insist on their disagreement; the Lords adhere\r\nto their amendment; the Commons adhere to their disagreement. The term of\r\ninsisting may be repeated as often as they choose, to keep the question\r\nopen. But the first adherence by either renders it necessary for the\r\nother side to recede or adhere also; when the matter is usually suffered\r\nto fall.--10 _Grey_, 148. Latterly, however, there are instances of their\r\nhaving gone to a second adherence. There must be an absolute conclusion\r\nof the subject somewhere, or otherwise transactions between the Houses\r\nwould be endless.--3 _Hats._ 268, 270. The term of insisting, we are told\r\nby Sir John Trevor, was then [1679] newly introduced into Parliamentary\r\nusage, by the Lords.--7 _Grey_, 94. It was certainly a happy innovation,\r\nas it multiplies the opportunities of trying modifications which may bring\r\nthe House to a concurrence. Either House, however, is free to pass over\r\nthe term of insisting, and to adhere in the first instance--10 _Grey_,\r\n146. But it is not respectful to the other. In the ordinary Parliamentary\r\ncourse, there are two free conferences at least before adherence.--10\r\n_Grey_, 147.\r\n\r\nEither House may recede from its amendment, and agree to the bill;\r\nor recede from their disagreement to the amendment, and agree to the\r\nsame absolutely, or with an amendment. For here the disagreement and\r\nreceding destroy one another, and the subject stands as before the\r\ndisagreement.--_Elsynge_, 23, 27; 9 _Grey_, 476.\r\n\r\nBut the House cannot recede from or insist on, its own amendment with\r\nan amendment, for the same reason that it cannot send to the other\r\nHouse an amendment to its own act after it has passed the act. They may\r\nmodify an amendment from the other House by ingrafting an amendment on\r\nit, because they have never assented to it; but they cannot amend their\r\nown amendment, because they have, on the question, passed it in that\r\nform; 9 _Grey_, 353; 10 _Grey_, 240. In Senate, March 29, 1798. Nor\r\nwhere one House has adhered to their amendment, and the other agrees\r\nwith an amendment, can the first House depart from the form which they\r\nhave fixed by an adherence.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a money bill, the Lords' proposed amendments became,\r\nby delay, confessedly necessary. The Commons, however, refused them,\r\nas infringing on their privilege as to money bills, but they offered\r\nthemselves to add to the bill a proviso to the same effect, which had\r\nno coherence with the Lords' amendments, and urged, that it was an\r\nexpedient warranted by precedent, and not unparliamentary in a case\r\nbecome impracticable, and irremediable in any other way.--3 _Hats._ 256,\r\n266, 270, 271. But the Lords refused and the bill was lost, 1 _Chand._\r\n288. A like case, 1 _Chand._ 311. So the Commons resolve, that it is\r\nunparliamentary to strike out at a conference anything in a bill which\r\nhath been agreed and passed by both Houses, 6 _Grey_, 274; 1 _Chand._ 312.\r\n\r\nA motion to amend an amendment from the other House, takes precedence\r\nof a motion to agree or disagree.\r\n\r\nA bill originating in one House, is passed by the other with an amendment.\r\n\r\nThe originating House agrees to their amendment with an amendment. The\r\nother may agree to their amendment with an amendment; that being only\r\nin the second and not the third degree. For, as to the amending House,\r\nthe first amendment with which they passed the bill is a part of its\r\ntext; it is the only text they have agreed to. The amendment to that\r\ntext by the originating House, therefore, is only in the 1st degree, and\r\nthe amendment to that again by the amending House is only in the 2d, to\r\nwit, an amendment to an amendment, and so admissible. Just so when, on a\r\nbill from the originating House, the other, at its 2d reading, makes an\r\namendment; on the 3d reading, this amendment is become the text of the\r\nbill, and if an amendment to it be moved, an amendment to that amendment\r\nmay also be moved, as being only in the second degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVI.\r\n\r\nCONFERENCES.\r\n\r\nIt is on the occasion of amendments between the Houses that conferences\r\nare usually asked; but they may be asked in all cases of difference of\r\nopinion between the two Houses on matters depending between them. The\r\nrequest of a conference, however, must always be by the House which is\r\npossessed of the papers.--3 _Hats._ 71; 1 _Grey_, 435; 4 _Hats._ 3, 43.\r\n\r\nConferences may be either simple or free. At a conference simply,\r\nwritten reasons are prepared by the House asking it, and they are read\r\nand delivered without debate, to the managers of the other House at\r\nthe conference; but are not then to be answered.--3 _Grey_, 144. The\r\nother House then, if satisfied, vote the reasons satisfactory, or say\r\nnothing; if not satisfied, they resolve them not satisfactory, and ask\r\na conference on the subject of the last conference, where they read and\r\ndeliver in like manner written answers to those reasons.--3 _Grey_, 183.\r\nThey are meant chiefly to record the justification of each House to the\r\nnation at large, and to posterity, and in proof that the miscarriage of\r\na necessary measure is not imputable to them.--3 _Grey_, 255. At free\r\nconferences, the managers discuss _vivâ voce_ and freely, and interchange\r\npropositions for such modifications as may be made in a Parliamentary\r\nway, and may bring the sense of the two houses together. And each party\r\nreports in writing to their respective Houses the substance of what is\r\nsaid on both sides, and it is entered in their journals.--6 _Grey_, 220;\r\n3 _Hats._ 280. (_Vide Joint Rules_, 1.) This report cannot be amended\r\nor altered as that of a committee may be.--_Journ. Senate_, May 24, 1796.\r\n\r\nA conference may be asked, before the House asking it has come to a\r\nresolution of disagreement, insisting or adhering.--3 _Hats._ 269, 341.\r\nIn which case the papers are not left with the other conferees, but are\r\nbrought back to be the foundation of the vote to be given. And this is\r\nthe most reasonable and respectful proceeding. For, as was urged by the\r\nLords on a particular occasion, \"it is held vain, and below the wisdom\r\nof Parliament, to reason or argue against fixed resolutions, and upon\r\nterms of impossibility to persuade.\"--3 _Hats._ 226. So the Commons say\r\n\"an adherence is never delivered at a free conference, which implies\r\ndebate.\"--10 _Grey_, 147. And on another occasion, the Lords made it\r\nan objection that the Commons had asked a free conference after they\r\nhad made resolutions of adhering. It was then affirmed, however, on\r\nthe part of the Commons, that nothing was more Parliamentary than to\r\nproceed with free conferences after adhering; 3 _Hats._ 269; and we do\r\nin fact see instances of conference or of free conference, asked after\r\nthe resolution of disagreeing.--3 _Hats._ 251, 253, 260, 286, 291, 316,\r\n349, of insisting, _ib._ 280, 296, 299, 319, 322, 355, of adhering, 269,\r\n270, 283, 300; and even of a second or final adherence.--3 _Hats._ 270.\r\nAnd in all cases of conference asked after a vote of disagreement, &c.,\r\nthe conferees of the House asking it are to leave the papers with the\r\nconferees of the other; and in one case where they refused to receive\r\nthem, they were left on the table in the conference chamber.--3 _Hats._\r\n271, 317, 323, 354; 10 _Grey_, 146. The Commons affirm, that it is\r\nusual to have two free conferences or more before either House proceeds\r\nto adhere, because, before that time, the Houses have not had the full\r\nopportunity of making replies to one another's arguments, and, to adhere\r\nso suddenly and unexpectedly, excludes all possibility of offering\r\nexpedients.--4 _Hats._ 330.\r\n\r\nAfter a free conference the usage is to proceed with free conferences,\r\nand not to return again to a conference.--3 _Hats._ 270; 9 _Grey_, 229.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference denied, a free conference may be asked.--1 _Grey_, 45.\r\n\r\nWhen a conference is asked, the subject of it must be expressed, or the\r\nconference not agreed to.--_Ord. H. Com._ 89; 1 _Grey_, 425; 7 _Grey_,\r\n31. They are sometimes asked to inquire concerning an offence or default\r\nof a member of the other House, 6 _Grey_, 181; 1 _Chand._ 304; or the\r\nfailure of the other House to present to the King a bill passed by both\r\nHouses, 8 _Grey_, 302; or on information received, and relating to the\r\nsafety of the nation, 10 _Grey_, 171, or when the methods of Parliament\r\nare thought by the one House to have been departed from by the other,\r\na conference is asked to come to a right understanding thereon.--10\r\n_Grey_, 148. So, when an unparliamentary message has been sent, instead\r\nof answering it, they ask a conference.--3 _Grey_, 155. Formerly, an\r\naddress, or articles of impeachment, or a bill with amendments, or a vote\r\nof the House, or concurrence in a vote, or a message from the King, were\r\nsometimes communicated by way of conference.--7 _Grey_, 128, 300, 387; 7\r\n_Grey_, 80; 8 _Grey_, 210, 255; 1 _Torbuck's Deb._ 278; 10 _Grey_, 293;\r\n1 _Chandler_, 49, 287. But this is not modern practice.--8 _Grey_, 255.\r\n\r\nA conference has been asked after the first reading of a bill.--1 _Grey_,\r\n194. This is a singular instance. During the time of a conference, the\r\nHouse can do no business. As soon as the names of the managers are called\r\nover, and they are gone to the conference, the Speaker leaves the chair,\r\nwithout any question, and resumes it in the return of the managers. It\r\nis the same while the managers of an impeachment are at the House of\r\nLords.--4 _Hats._ 47, 209, 288.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVII.\r\n\r\nMESSAGES.\r\n\r\nMessages between the Houses are to be sent only while both Houses are\r\nsitting.--3 _Hats._ 15. They are received during a debate, without\r\nadjourning the debate.--3 _Hats._ 22.\r\n\r\n$In Senate, the messengers are introduced in any state of business,\r\nexcept--1. While a question is putting. 2. While the yeas and nays are\r\ncalling. 3. While the ballots are calling. The first case is short: the\r\nsecond and third are cases where any interruption might occasion errors\r\ndifficult to be corrected.--So arranged, June 15th, 1798.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, as in Parliament, if the House be\r\nin a committee when a messenger attends, the Speaker takes the chair\r\nto receive the message, and then quits it to return into a committee,\r\nwithout any question or interruption.--4 _Grey_, 226.$\r\n\r\nMessengers are not saluted by the members, but by the Speaker, for the\r\nHouse.--2 _Grey_, 253, 274.\r\n\r\nIf messengers commit an error in delivering their messages, they may\r\nbe admitted, or called in, to correct their message.--4 _Grey_, 41.\r\nAccordingly, March 13, 1800, the Senate having made two amendments to\r\na bill from the House of Representatives, their secretary, by mistake,\r\ndelivered one only; which being inadmissible by itself, that House\r\ndisagreed, and notified the Senate of their disagreement. This produced\r\na discovery of the mistake. The secretary was sent to the other House to\r\ncorrect his mistake, the correction was received, and the two amendments\r\nacted on _de novo_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the messenger, who has brought bills from the other House,\r\nhas retired, the Speaker holds the bills in his hand, and acquaints\r\nthe House, \"That the other House have, by their messenger, sent certain\r\nbills,\" and then reads their titles, and delivers them to the clerk to\r\nbe safely kept till they shall be called for to be read.--_Hakew._ 178.\r\n\r\nIt is not the usage for one House to inform the other by what numbers a\r\nbill has passed.--10 _Grey_, 150. Yet they have sometimes recommended a\r\nbill as of great importance to the consideration of the House to which\r\nit is sent.--3 _Hats._ 25. Nor when they have rejected a bill from the\r\nother House, do they give notice of it; but it passes sub-silentio to\r\nprevent unbecoming altercation.--1 _Black._ 133.\r\n\r\n$But in Congress the rejection is notified by message to the House in\r\nwhich the bill originated.$\r\n\r\nA question is never asked by the one House of the other by way of message,\r\nbut only at a conference; for this is an interrogatory, not a message.--3\r\n_Grey_, 151, 181.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is sent by one House to the other, and is neglected, they\r\nmay send a message to remind them of it.--3 _Hats._ 25;_5 Grey_, 154.\r\nBut if it be mere inattention, it is better to have it done informally,\r\nby communications between the Speakers, or members of the two Houses.\r\n\r\nWhere the subject of a message is of a nature that it can properly be\r\ncommunicated to both Houses of Parliament, it is expected that this\r\ncommunication should be made to both on the same day. But where a message\r\nwas accompanied with an original declaration, signed by the party, to\r\nwhich the message referred, its being sent to one House was not noticed\r\nby the other, because the declaration, being original, could not possibly\r\nbe sent to both Houses at the same time.--2 _Hats._ 260, 261, 262.\r\n\r\nThe King having sent original letters to the Commons, afterwards desires\r\nthey may be returned, that he may communicate them to the Lords.--1\r\n_Chandler_, 303.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVIII.\r\n\r\nASSENT.\r\n\r\nThe House which has received a bill, and passed it, may present it for\r\nthe King's assent, and ought to do it, though they have not by message\r\nnotified to the other their passage of it. Yet the notifying by message\r\nis a form which ought to be observed between the two Houses, from motives\r\nof respect and good understanding.--3 _Hats._ 242. Were the bill to be\r\nwithheld from being presented to the King, it would be an infringement\r\nof the rules of Parliament.--2 _Hats._ 242.\r\n\r\n$When a bill has passed both Houses of Congress, the House last acting on\r\nit notifies its passage to the other, and delivers the bill to the joint\r\ncommittee of enrolment, who see that it is truly enrolled in parchment.\r\nWhen the bill is enrolled, it is not to be written in paragraphs, but\r\nsolidly and all of a piece, that the blanks within the paragraphs may\r\nnot give room for forgery.--9 _Grey_, 143. It is then put in the hands\r\nof the clerk of the House of Representatives, to have it signed by the\r\nSpeaker. The clerk then brings it by way of message to the Senate, to be\r\nsigned by their President. The secretary of the Senate returns it to the\r\ncommittee of enrolment, who present it to the President of the United\r\nStates. If he approves, he signs and deposits it among the rolls in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State, and notifies by message the House in\r\nwhich it originated, that he has approved and signed it; of which that\r\nHouse informs the other by message. If the President disapproves, he is\r\nto return it, with his objections, to the House in which it shall have\r\noriginated; who are to enter the objections at large on their journal,\r\nand proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds\r\nof the House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together\r\nwith the President's objections, to the other House, by which it shall\r\nlikewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it\r\nshall become a law. If any bill shall not be returned by the President\r\nwithin ten days (Sunday's excepted) after it shall have been presented\r\nto him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it,\r\nunless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which\r\ncase it shall not be a law.--_Const. U. S._, Art. I. Sec. 7.\r\n\r\nEvery order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives may be necessary, (except on\r\na question of adjournment,) shall be presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States, and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved\r\nby him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be re-passed by two-thirds\r\nof the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and\r\nlimitations prescribed in the case of a bill.--_Const. U. S._, Art. I.\r\nSec. 7.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIX.\r\n\r\nJOURNALS.\r\n\r\n$Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to\r\ntime publish the same, excepting such parts as may, in their judgment,\r\nrequire secrecy.--_Const._, I. 5, 3.\r\n\r\nEvery vote of Senate shall be entered on the journal, and a brief\r\nstatement of the contents of each petition, memorial, or paper, presented\r\nto the Senate, be also inserted on the journal.--_Rule_ 24.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Senate, when not acting as in a committee of\r\nthe House, shall be entered on the journals, as concisely as possible,\r\ncare being taken to detail a true account of the proceedings.--_Rule_ 26.\r\n\r\nThe titles of bills, and such part thereof only as shall be affected\r\nby proposed amendments, shall be inserted on the journals.--_Rule_ 27.$\r\n\r\nIf a question is interrupted by a vote to adjourn, or to proceed to the\r\norders of the day, the original question is never printed in the journal,\r\nit never having been a vote, nor introductory to any vote; but when\r\nsuppressed by the previous question, the first question must be stated,\r\nin order to introduce, and make intelligible, the second.--2 _Hats._ 83.\r\n\r\nSo also, when a question is postponed, adjourned, or laid on the table,\r\nthe original question, though not yet a vote, must be expressed in the\r\njournals; because it makes part of the vote of postponement, adjourning,\r\nor laying on the table.\r\n\r\nWhere amendments are made to a question, those amendments are not printed\r\nin the journals, separated from the question; but only the question as\r\nfinally agreed to by the House. The rule of entering in the journals\r\nonly what the House has agreed to, is founded in great prudence and good\r\nsense; as there may be many questions proposed which it may be improper\r\nto publish to the world, in the form in which they are made.--2 _Hats._\r\n85.\r\n\r\n$In both Houses of Congress, all questions whereon the yeas and nays are\r\ndesired by one-fifth of the members present, whether decided affirmatively\r\nor negatively, must be entered on the journals.--_Const._ I. 5, 3.$\r\n\r\nThe first order for printing the votes of the House of Commons, was\r\nOctober 30, 1685.--1 _Chandler_, 387.\r\n\r\nSome judges have been of opinion, that the journals of the House of\r\nCommons are no records, but remembrances. But this is no law.--_Cob._\r\n110, 111; _Lex. Parl._ 114, 115; _Jour. H. C._ Mar. 17, 1592; _Hale\r\nParl._ 105. For the Lords, in their House, have power of judicature;\r\nthe Commons, in their House, have power of judicature; and both Houses\r\ntogether have power of judicature; and the book of the clerk of the House\r\nof Commons is a record, as is affirmed by act of Parliament.--6 _H._ 8.\r\n_c._ 16; _Inst._ 23, 24; and every member of the House of Commons has a\r\njudicial place.--4 _Inst._ 15. As records, they are open to every person;\r\nand a printed vote of either House is sufficient ground for the other\r\nto notice it. Either may appoint a committee to inspect the journals of\r\nthe other, and report what has been done by the other in any particular\r\ncase.--2 _Hats._ 261; 3 _Hats._ 27, 30. Every member has a right to see\r\nthe journals, and to take and publish votes from them. Being a record,\r\nevery one may see and publish them.--6 _Grey_, 118, 119.\r\n\r\nOn information of a mis-entry or omission of an entry in the journal, a\r\ncommittee may be appointed to examine and rectify it, and report it to\r\nthe House.--2 _Hats._ 194, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION L.\r\n\r\nADJOURNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe two Houses of Parliament have the sole, separate, and independent\r\npower of adjourning, each their respective Houses. The King has no\r\nauthority to adjourn them; he can only signify his desire, and it is in\r\nthe wisdom and prudence of either House to comply with his requisition,\r\nor not, as they see fitting.--2 _Hats._ 332; 1 _Blackstone_, 186; 5\r\n_Grey_, 122.\r\n\r\n$By the Constitution of the United States, a smaller number than a\r\nmajority may adjourn from day to day.--I. 5. But neither House, during\r\nthe session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn\r\nfor more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the\r\ntwo Houses shall be sitting.--I. 5. The President may, on extraordinary\r\noccasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of\r\ndisagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he\r\nmay adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.--_Const._ II. 3.$\r\n\r\nA motion to adjourn simply, cannot be amended as by adding, \"To a\r\nparticular day.\" But must be put simply, \"That this House do now adjourn?\"\r\nand if carried in the affirmative, it is adjourned to the next sitting\r\nday, unless it has come to a previous resolution, \"That at its rising,\r\nit will adjourn to a particular day;\" and then the House is adjourned\r\nto that day.--2 _Hats._ 82.\r\n\r\nWhere it is convenient that the business of the House be suspended for\r\na short time, as for a conference presently to be held, &c., it adjourns\r\nduring pleasure.--2 _Hats._ 305. Or for a quarter of an hour.--5 _Grey_,\r\n331.\r\n\r\nIf a question be put for adjournment, it is no adjournment till the\r\nSpeaker pronounces it.--5 _Grey_, 137. And from courtesy and respect,\r\nno member leaves his place till the Speaker has passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LI.\r\n\r\nA SESSION.\r\n\r\nParliament have three modes of separation, to wit, by adjournment, by\r\nprorogation, by dissolution by the King, or by the efflux of the term\r\nfor which they were elected. Prorogation or dissolution constitutes there\r\nwhat is called a session; provided some act has passed. In this case, all\r\nmatters depending before them are discontinued, and at their next meeting\r\nare to be taken up _de novo_, if taken up at all.--1 _Blackstone_, 186.\r\nAdjournment, which is by themselves, is no more than a continuance of\r\nthe session from one day to another, or for a fortnight, a month, &c.,\r\n_ad libitum_. All matters depending remain in _statu quo_, and when they\r\nmeet again, be the term ever so distant, are resumed without any fresh\r\ncommencement, at the point at which they were left.--1 _Lev._ 165; _Lex.\r\nParl. c._ 2; 1 _Ro. Rep._ 29; 4 _Inst._ 7, 27, 28; _Hut._ 61; 1 _Mod._\r\n152; _Ruffh. Jac. L. Dict. Parliaments_; _Blackstone_, 186. Their whole\r\nsession is considered in law but as one day, and has relation to the\r\nfirst day thereof.--_Bro. Abro. Parliament_, 86.\r\n\r\nCommittees may be appointed to sit during a recess by adjournment, but\r\nnot by prorogation.--5 _Grey_, 374; 9 _Grey_, 350; 1 _Chandler_, 50.\r\nNeither House can continue any portion of itself in any Parliamentary\r\nfunction, beyond the end of the session, without the consent of the other\r\ntwo branches. When done, it is by a bill constituting them commissioners\r\nfor the particular purpose.\r\n\r\n$Congress separate in two ways only, to wit, by adjournment or dissolution\r\nby the efflux of their time. What then constitutes a session with them?\r\nA dissolution certainly closes one session, and the meeting of the new\r\nCongress begins another. The Constitution authorizes the President, \"On\r\nextraordinary occasions, to convene both Houses, or either of them.\"--Art.\r\nI. Sec. 3. If convened by the President's proclamation, this must begin\r\na new session, and of course determine the preceding one to have been\r\na session. So, if it meets under the clause of the Constitution, which\r\nsays, \"The Congress shall assemble, at least once in every year, and such\r\nmeeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by\r\nlaw appoint a different day,\"--I, 4,--this must begin a new session. For\r\neven if the last adjournment was to this day, the act of adjournment is\r\nmerged in the higher authority of the Constitution, and the meeting will\r\nbe under that, and not under their adjournment. So far we have fixed\r\nlandmarks for determining sessions. In other cases, it is declared by\r\nthe joint vote authorizing the President of the Senate and the Speaker\r\nto close the session on a fixed day, which is usually in the following\r\nform, \"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives, that the\r\nPresident of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives,\r\nbe authorized to close the present session, by adjourning their respective\r\nHouses on the ---- day of ----.\"$\r\n\r\nWhen it was said above, that all matters depending before Parliament\r\nwere discontinued by the determination of the session, it was not\r\nmeant for judiciary cases, depending before the House of Lords, such\r\nas impeachments, appeals, and writs of error. These stand continued\r\nof course to the next session.--_Raym._ 120, 381; _Ruffh. Jac. L. D.\r\nParliament_.\r\n\r\n$Impeachments stand in like manner continued before the Senate of the\r\nUnited States.$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LII.\r\n\r\nTREATIES.\r\n\r\n$The President of the United States has power, by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the\r\nSenators present concur.--_Const. U. S._ Art. II. Sec. 2.\r\n\r\nResolved, That all confidential communications, made by the President\r\nof the United States to the Senate, shall be, by the members thereof,\r\nkept inviolably secret; and that all treaties, which may hereafter be\r\nlaid before the Senate, shall also be kept secret, until the Senate\r\nshall, by their resolution, take off the injunction of secrecy.--_Dec.\r\n22d, 1804._$\r\n\r\nTreaties are legislative acts. A treaty is a law of the land. It differs\r\nfrom other laws only as it must have the consent of a foreign nation,\r\nbeing but a contract with respect to that nation. In all countries, I\r\nbelieve, except England, treaties are made by the legislative power; and\r\nthere, also, if they touch the laws of the land, they must be approved by\r\nParliament. Ware _vs._ Hilton.--3 _Dallas's Rep._ 199. It is acknowledged,\r\nfor instance, that the King of Great Britain cannot, by a treaty, make a\r\ncitizen of an alien.--_Vattel_, _b._ 1, _c._ 19, _sec._ 214. An act of\r\nParliament was necessary to validate the American treaty of 1783. And\r\nabundant examples of such acts can be cited. In the case of the treaty\r\nof Utrecht, in 1712, the commercial articles required the concurrence of\r\nParliament. But a bill brought in for that purpose was rejected. France,\r\nthe other contracting party, suffered these articles, in practice, to\r\nbe not insisted on, and adhered to the rest of the treaty.--4 _Russell's\r\nHist. Mod. Europe_, 457; 2 _Smollet_, 242, 246.\r\n\r\n$By the Constitution of the United States, this department of legislation\r\nis confined to two branches only, of the ordinary Legislature; the\r\nPresident originating, and Senate having a negative. To what subject\r\nthis power extends, has not been defined in detail by the Constitution;\r\nnor are we entirely agreed among ourselves. 1. It is admitted that it\r\nmust concern the foreign nation, party to the contract, or it would be\r\na mere nullity _res inter alias acta_. 2. By the general power to make\r\ntreaties, the Constitution must have intended to comprehend only those\r\nobjects which are usually regulated by treaty, and cannot be otherwise\r\nregulated. 3. It must have meant to except out of these the rights\r\nreserved to the States; for surely the President and Senate cannot do by\r\ntreaty what the whole government is interdicted from doing in any way.\r\n4. And also to except those subjects of legislation in which it gave a\r\nparticipation to the House of Representatives. This last exception is\r\ndenied by some, on the ground that it would leave very little matter\r\nfor the treaty power to work on. The less the better say others. The\r\nConstitution thought it wise to restrain the Executive and Senate from\r\nentangling and embroiling our affairs with those of Europe. Besides, as\r\nthe negotiations are carried on by the Executive alone, the subjecting\r\nto the ratification of the Representatives such articles as are within\r\ntheir participation, is no more inconvenient than to the Senate. But\r\nthe ground of this exemption is denied as unfounded. For examine, _e.\r\ng._, the treaty of commerce with France, and it will be found that out\r\nof thirty-one articles, there are not more than small portions of two\r\nor three of them which would not still remain as subjects of treaties,\r\nuntouched by these exceptions.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$Treaties being declared, equally with the laws of the United States,\r\nto be the supreme law of the land, it is understood that an act of the\r\nLegislature alone can declare them infringed and rescinded. This was\r\naccordingly the process adopted in the case of France, 1798.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$It has been the usage of the Executive, when it communicates a treaty to\r\nthe Senate for their ratification, to communicate also the correspondence\r\nof the negotiations. This having been omitted in the case of the Prussian\r\ntreaty, was asked by a vote of the House of February 12, 1800, and was\r\nobtained. And in December, 1800, the Convention of that year, between\r\nthe United States and France, with the report of the negotiations by\r\nthe Envoys, but not their instructions, being laid before the Senate,\r\nthe instructions were asked for, and communicated by the President.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$The mode of voting on questions of ratification is by nominal call.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$Resolved, as a standing rule, That whenever a treaty shall be laid\r\nbefore the Senate for ratification, it shall be read a first time for\r\ninformation only; when no motion to reject, ratify, or modify the whole\r\nor any part, shall be received.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$That its second reading shall be for consideration; and on a subsequent\r\nday, when it shall be taken up as in a committee of the whole, and\r\nevery one shall be free to move a question on any particular article in\r\nthis form: \"Will the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of\r\nthis article?\" or to propose amendments thereto, either by inserting or\r\nleaving out words, in which last case the question shall be, \"Shall the\r\nwords stand part of the article?\" And in every of the said cases, the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be required to\r\ndecide affirmatively. And when through the whole, the proceedings shall\r\nbe stated to the House, and questions be again severally put thereon\r\nfor confirmation, or new ones proposed, requiring in like manner a\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds for whatever is retained or inserted.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$That the votes so confirmed shall, by the House or a committee thereof,\r\nbe reduced into the form of a ratification with or without modifications,\r\nas may have been decided, and shall be proposed on a subsequent day, when\r\nevery one shall again be free to move amendments, either by inserting or\r\nleaving out words; in which last case the question shall be, \"Shall the\r\nwords stand part of the resolution?\" And in both cases the concurrence\r\nof two-thirds shall be requisite to carry the affirmative; as well as\r\non the final question to advise and consent to the ratification in the\r\nform agreed to.--_Rule of Jan. 6, 1801._$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$Resolved, That when any question may have been decided by the Senate,\r\nin which two-thirds of the members present are necessary to carry the\r\naffirmative, any member who voted on that side which prevailed in the\r\nquestion may be at liberty to move for a reconsideration; and a motion\r\nfor reconsideration shall be decided by a majority of votes.--_Rule of\r\nFeb. 3, 1801._$\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LIII.\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\n$The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of\r\nimpeachment.--_Const. U. S._ Art. I. Sec. 3.$\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n$The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.

Judgment, in cases of impeachment, shall not extend\r\nfurther than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and\r\nenjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit, under the United States.\r\nBut the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to\r\nindictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, according to law.--_Const.\r\nU.

S._ Art. II. Sec. 4.\r\n\r\nThe trial of crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\r\njury.--_Const. U. S._ Art. III. Sec. 2.$\r\n\r\nThese are the provisions of the Constitution of the United States on\r\nthe subject of impeachments. The following is a sketch on some of the\r\nprinciples and practices of England on the same subject.\r\n\r\n_Jurisdiction._--The Lords cannot impeach any to themselves, nor join in\r\nthe accusation, because they are judges.--_Seld. Judic. in Parl._ 12,\r\n63. Nor can they proceed against a commoner, but on complaint of the\r\nCommons.--_Ib._ 84. The Lords may not, by the law, try a commoner for\r\ncapital offence, on the information of the King, or a private person;\r\nbecause the accused is entitled to a trial by his peers generally; but\r\non accusation by the House of Commons, they may proceed against the\r\ndelinquent, of whatsoever degree, and whatsoever be the nature of the\r\noffence; for there they do not assume to themselves trial at common\r\nlaw. The Commons are then instead of a jury, and the judgment is given\r\non their demand, which is instead of a verdict. So the Lords do only\r\njudge but not try the delinquent.--_Ib._ 6, 7. But Wooddeson denies that\r\na commoner can now be charged capitally before the Lords, even by the\r\nCommons; and cites Fitzharris's case, 1681, impeached of high treason,\r\nwhere the Lords remitted the prosecution to the inferior court.--8\r\n_Grey's Deb._ 325, 6, 7; 2 _Wooddeson_, 601, 576; 3 _Seld._ 1610, 1619,\r\n1641; 4 _Black._ 257; 3 _Seld._ 1604, 1618, 9. 1656.\r\n\r\n_Accusation._--The Commons, as the grand inquest of the nation, become\r\nsuitors for penal justice.--2 _Woodd._ 597; 6 _Grey_, 356. The general\r\ncourse is to pass a resolution, containing a criminal charge against\r\nthe supposed delinquent, and then to direct some member to impeach him\r\nby oral accusation, at the bar of the House of Lords, in the name of\r\nthe Commons. The person signifies, that the articles will be exhibited,\r\nand desires that the delinquent may be sequestered from his seat, or be\r\ncommitted, or that the Peers will take order for his appearance.--_Sachev.\r\nTrial._ 325; 2 _Woodd._ 602, 605; _Lords' Jour._ 3 June, 1701; 1 _Wms._\r\n616; _Grey_, 324.\r\n\r\n_Process._--If the party do not appear, proclamations are to be issued\r\ngiving him a day to appear. On their return they are strictly examined.\r\nIf any error be found in them, a new proclamation issues, giving a\r\nshort day. If he appear not, his goods may be arrested, and they may\r\nproceed.--_Seld. Jud._ 98, 99.\r\n\r\n_Articles._--The accusation (article) of the Commons, is substituted\r\nin place of an indictment. Thus, by the usage of Parliament, an\r\nimpeachment for writing or speaking the particular words, need not be\r\nspecified.--_Sach. Tr._ 325; 2 _Woodd._ 602, 605; _Lords' Journ._ 3\r\nJune, 1701; 1 _Wms._ 616.\r\n\r\n_Appearance._--If he appears, and the case be capital, he answers\r\nin custody; though not if the accusation be general. He is not to\r\nbe committed but on special accusations. If it be for a misdemeanor\r\nonly, he answers a Lord in his place, a Commoner at the bar, and not\r\nin custody, unless, on the answer, the Lords find cause to commit him\r\ntill he find sureties to attend, and lest he should fly.--_Seld. Jud._\r\n98, 99. A copy of the articles is given him, and a day fixed for his\r\nanswer.--_T. Ray_; 1 _Rushw._ 268; _Fost._ 232; 1 _Clar. Hist. of the\r\nReb._ 379. On a misdemeanor, his appearance may be in person, or he may\r\nanswer in writing, or by attorney.--_Seld. Jud._ 100. The general rule\r\non accusation for a misdemeanor is, that in such a state of liberty or\r\nrestraint as the party is when the Commons complain of him, in such he is\r\nto answer. _Seld. Jud._ 101. If previously committed by the Commons, he\r\nanswers as a prisoner. But this may be called, in some sort, _judicium\r\nparium suorum_.--_Seld. Jud._ In misdemeanors, the party has a right to\r\ncounsel by the common law; but not in capital cases.--_Seld. Jud._ 102-5.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The answer need not observe great strictness of form. He may\r\nplead guilty as to part, and defend as to the residue; or, saving all\r\nexceptions, deny the whole, or give a particular answer to each article\r\nseparately.--1 _Rush._ 274; 2 _Rush._ 1374; 12 _Parl. Hist._ 442; 3\r\n_Lords' Journ._ 13 Nov. 1643; 2 _Wood._ 607. But he cannot plead a pardon\r\nin bar to the impeachment.--2 _Wood._ 618; 2 _St. Tr._ 735.\r\n\r\n_Replication, rejoinder, &c._--There may be a replication, rejoinder,\r\n&c.--_Seld. Jud._ 114; 8 _Grey's Deb._ 233; _Sach. Tr._ 15; _Journ.\r\nHouse of Commons_, 6 March, 1640, 1.\r\n\r\n_Witnesses._--The practice is to swear the witnesses in open House, and\r\nthen examine them there: or a committee may be named, who shall examine\r\nthem in committee either on interrogatories agreed on in the House, or\r\nsuch as the committee, in their discretion, shall demand.--_Seld. Jud._\r\n120, 123.\r\n\r\n_Jury._--In the case of Alice Pierce, 1 _R._ 2. a jury was empannelled\r\nfor her trial before a committee.--_Seld. Jud._ 123. But this was on\r\na complaint, not an impeachment by the Commons.--_Seld. Jud._ 163. It\r\nmust also have been for a misdemeanor only, as the Lords Spiritual\r\nsat in the case, which they do on misdemeanors, but not in capital\r\ncases.--_Seld. Jud._ 148. The judgment was a forfeiture of all her lands\r\nand goods.--_Seld. Jud._ 188. This, Selden says, is the only jury he\r\nfinds recorded in Parliament for misdemeanors; but he makes no doubt\r\nif the delinquent doth put himself on the trial of his country, a jury\r\nought to be empannelled: and he adds, that it is not so on impeachment\r\nby the Commons; for they are in _oco proprio_, and here no jury ought to\r\nbe empannelled.--_Ib._ 124. The Lord Berkley, 6 _E._ 3, was arranged for\r\nthe murder of, _L._ 2, on an information on the part of the King, and\r\nnot on impeachment of the Commons; for then they had been _patria sua_.\r\nHe waived his peerage, and was tried by a jury of Gloucestershire and\r\nWarwickshire.--_Ib._ 125. In one, 1 _H._ 7, the Common protest that they\r\nare not to be considered as parties to any judgment given, or hereafter\r\nto be given in Parliament.--_Ib._ 133. They have been generally, and\r\nmore justly considered, as is before stated, as the grand jury. For the\r\nconceit of Selden is certainly not accurate, that they are the _patria\r\nsua_ of the accused, and that the Lords do only judge, but not try. It\r\nis undeniable that they do try. For they examine witnesses as to the\r\nfacts, and acquit or condemn according to their own belief of them. And\r\nLord Hale says, \"the Peers are judges of law as well as of fact.\"--2\r\n_Hale_, _P. C._ 275. Consequently of fact as well as of law.\r\n\r\n_Presence of Commons._--The Commons are to be present at the examination\r\nof witnesses.--_Seld. Jud._ 124. Indeed, they are to attend throughout,\r\neither as a committee of the whole House; or otherwise, at discretion,\r\nappoint managers to conduct the proofs.--_Rushw. Tr. of Straff._ 37;\r\n_Com. journ._ 4 Feb. 1709, 10; 2 _Wood._ 614. And judgment is not to\r\nbe given till they demand it.--_Seld. Jud._ 124. But they are not to be\r\npresent on impeachment when the Lords consider of the answer or proofs,\r\nand determine of their judgment. Their presence, however, is necessary\r\nat the answer and judgment in cases capital.--_Ib._ 58, 159; as well as\r\nnot capital, 162. The Lords debate the judgment among themselves. Then\r\nthe vote is first taken on the question of guilty or not guilty; and if\r\nthey convict, the question, or particular sentence, is out of that which\r\nseemeth to be most generally agreed on.--_Seld. Jud._ 167; 2 _Wood._ 612.\r\n\r\n_Judgment._--Judgments in Parliament, for death, have been strictly\r\nguided _per legem terræ_, which they cannot alter; and not at all\r\naccording to their discretion. They can neither admit any part of the\r\nlegal judgment, nor add to it. Their sentence must be _secundum, non\r\nultra legem_.--_Seld. Jud._ 168, 169, 170, 171. This trial, though it\r\nvaries in external ceremony, yet differs not in essentials from criminal\r\nprosecutions before inferior courts. The same rules of evidence, the\r\nsame legal notions of crimes and punishments, prevail. For impeachments\r\nwere not framed to alter the law, but to carry it into more effectual\r\nexecution against two powerful delinquents. The judgment, therefore, is\r\nto be such as is warranted by legal principles or precedents.--6 _Stra.\r\nTr._ 14; 2 _Wood._ 611. The Chancellor gives judgments in misdemeanors;\r\nthe Lord High Steward, formerly, in cases of life and death.--_Seld.\r\nJud._ 180. But now the Steward is deemed not necessary.--_Fost._ 144; 1\r\n_Woodd._ 613. In misdemeanors, the greatest corporal punishment hath been\r\nimprisonment.--_Seld. Jud._ 184. The King's assent is necessary in capital\r\njudgments, (but 2 _Woodd._ 614. contra.) but not in misdemeanors.--_Seld.\r\nJud._ 136.\r\n\r\n_Continuance._--An impeachment is not discontinued by the dissolution\r\nof Parliament; but may be resumed by the new Parliament.--_T. Ray._ 383;\r\n5 _Com. jour._ 23 Dec. 1790; _Lord's jour._ May 16, 1791; 2 _Wood._ 618.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [1]\r\n\r\n     [JUDGE WYTHE.]                                  PHILADELPHIA,\r\n                                                February 28, 1800.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--I know how precious your time is, and how\r\n     exclusively you devote it to the duties of your office, yet\r\n     I venture to ask a few hours or minutes of it on motives of\r\n     public service, as well as private friendship. I will explain\r\n     the occasion of the application. You recollect enough of\r\n     the old Congress to remember that their mode of managing\r\n     the business of the House was not only unparliamentary,\r\n     but that the forms were so awkward and inconvenient that\r\n     it was impossible sometimes to get at the true sense of\r\n     the majority. The House of Representatives of the United\r\n     States are now pretty much in the same situation. In the\r\n     Senate it is in our power to get into a better way; our\r\n     ground is this: The Senate have established a few rules\r\n     for their government, and have subjected the decisions on\r\n     these and on _all other points of order_ without debate,\r\n     and without appeal, to the judgment of their President, he,\r\n     for his own sake, as well as theirs, must prefer recurring\r\n     to some system of rules ready formed; and there can be\r\n     no question that the Parliamentary rules are the best\r\n     known to us for managing the debates, and obtaining the\r\n     sense of a deliberative body. I have therefore made them\r\n     my rule of decision, rejecting those of the old Congress\r\n     altogether, and it gives entire satisfaction to the Senate;\r\n     insomuch that we shall not only have a good system there,\r\n     but probably, by the example of its effects, produce a\r\n     conformity in the other branch. But in the course of this\r\n     business I find perplexities, having for twenty years been\r\n     out of deliberative bodies, and become rusty as to many\r\n     points of proceeding; and so little has the Parliamentary\r\n     branch of the law been attended to, that I not only find\r\n     no person here, but not even a book to aid me. I had, at\r\n     an early period of life, read a good deal on the subject,\r\n     and common-placed what I read. This common-place has been\r\n     my pillar; but there are many questions of practice on\r\n     which that is silent, some of them are so minute indeed,\r\n     and belong too much to every-day's practice, that they\r\n     have never been thought worthy of being written down, yet\r\n     from desuetude they have slipped my memory. You will see\r\n     by the enclosed paper what they are. I know with what pain\r\n     you write: therefore I have left a margin in which you\r\n     can write a simple negative or affirmative opposite every\r\n     position, or perhaps, with as little trouble, correct the\r\n     text by striking out or interlining. This is what I have\r\n     earnestly to solicit from you, and I would not have given\r\n     you the trouble if I had had any other resource. But you\r\n     are, in fact, the only spark of Parliamentary science now\r\n     remaining to us. I am the more anxious, because I have\r\n     been forming a manual of Parliamentary law which I mean to\r\n     deposit with the Senate as the standard by which I judge,\r\n     and am willing to be judged. Though I should be opposed to\r\n     its being printed, yet it may be done perhaps without my\r\n     consent; and in that case I should be sorry indeed should it\r\n     go out with errors that a Tyro should not have committed.\r\n     And yet it is precisely those to which I am most exposed.\r\n     I am less afraid as to important matters, because for them\r\n     I have printed authorities; but it is those small matters\r\n     of daily practice, which twenty years ago were familiar to\r\n     me, but have in that time escaped my memory. I hope under\r\n     these circumstances you will pardon the trouble I propose\r\n     to you in the enclosed paper. I am not pressed in time,\r\n     so that your leisure will be sufficient for me.

I find no authority either\r\n     way; and I know it may be viewed under a different aspect.\r\n     It may be thought, that having decided separately not to\r\n     strike out the passage, the same question for striking\r\n     out cannot be put over again, though with a view to a\r\n     different insertion. Still I think it more reasonable and\r\n     convenient to consider the striking out and insertion as\r\n     forming one proposition; but should readily yield to any\r\n     evidence that the contrary is the practice in Parliament.\r\n\r\n     [5] Noes.--9 Grey, 365.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nTHE ANAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the three volumes bound in marbled paper._[6]\r\n\r\nIn these three volumes will be found copies of the official opinions[7]\r\ngiven in writing by me to General Washington, while I was Secretary\r\nof State, with sometimes the documents belonging to the case. Some of\r\nthese are the rough draughts, some press copies, some fair ones. In the\r\nearlier part of my acting in that office, I took no other note of the\r\npassing transactions; but after awhile, I saw the importance of doing\r\nit in aid of my memory. Very often, therefore, I made memorandums on\r\nloose scraps of paper, taken out of my pocket in the moment, and laid\r\nby to be copied fair at leisure, which, however, they hardly ever were.\r\nThese scraps, therefore, ragged, rubbed, and scribbled as they were, I\r\nhad bound with the others by a binder who came into my cabinet, did it\r\nunder my own eye, and without the opportunity of reading a single paper.\r\nAt this day, after the lapse of twenty-five years, or more, from their\r\ndates, I have given to the whole a calm revisal, when the passions of\r\nthe time are passed away, and the reasons of the transactions act alone\r\non the judgment. Some of the informations I had recorded, are now cut\r\nout from the rest, because I have seen that they were incorrect, or\r\ndoubtful, or merely personal or private, with which we have nothing to\r\ndo. I should perhaps have thought the rest not worth preserving, but for\r\ntheir testimony against the only history of that period, which pretends\r\nto have been compiled from authentic and unpublished documents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut a short review of facts * * * * * will show, that the contests of\r\nthat day were contests of principle, between the advocates of republican,\r\nand those of kingly government, and that had not the former made the\r\nefforts they did, our government would have been, even at this early day,\r\na very different thing from what the successful issue of those efforts\r\nhave made it.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between the States under the old Articles of Confederation,\r\nfor the purpose of joint defence against the aggression of Great Britain,\r\nwas found insufficient, as treaties of alliance generally are, to enforce\r\ncompliance with their mutual stipulations; and these, once fulfilled,\r\nthat bond was to expire of itself, and each State to become sovereign\r\nand independent in all things. Yet it could not but occur to every one,\r\nthat these separate independencies, like the petty States of Greece,\r\nwould be eternally at war with each other, and would become at length\r\nthe mere partisans and satellites of the leading powers of Europe. All\r\nthen must have looked forward to some further bond of union, which would\r\ninsure eternal peace, and a political system of our own, independent\r\nof that of Europe. Whether all should be consolidated into a single\r\ngovernment, or each remain independent as to internal matters, and the\r\nwhole form a single nation as to what was foreign only, and whether that\r\nnational government should be a monarchy or republic, would of course\r\ndivide opinions, according to the constitutions, the habits, and the\r\ncircumstances of each individual. Some officers of the army, as it has\r\nalways been said and believed, (and Steuben and Knox have ever been\r\nnamed as the leading agents,) trained to monarchy by military habits, are\r\nunderstood to have proposed to General Washington to decide this great\r\nquestion by the army before its disbandment, and to assume himself the\r\ncrown on the assurance of their support. The indignation with which he\r\nis said to have scouted this parricide proposition was equally worthy of\r\nhis virtue and wisdom. The next effort was, (on suggestion of the same\r\nindividuals, in the moment of their separation,) the establishment of\r\nan hereditary order under the name of the Cincinnati, ready prepared by\r\nthat distinction to be ingrafted into the future frame of government,\r\nand placing General Washington still at their head. The General wrote\r\nto me on this subject, while I was in Congress at Annapolis, and an\r\nextract from my letter is inserted in 5th Marshall's history, page 28.\r\nHe afterwards called on me at that place on his way to a meeting of the\r\nsociety, and after a whole evening of consultation, he left that place\r\nfully determined to use all his endeavors for its total suppression. But\r\nhe found it so firmly riveted in the affections of the members, that,\r\nstrengthened as they happened to be by an adventitious occurrence of the\r\nmoment, he could effect no more than the abolition of its hereditary\r\nprinciple. He called again on his return, and explained to me fully\r\nthe opposition which had been made, the effect of the occurrence from\r\nFrance, and the difficulty with which its duration had been limited to\r\nthe lives of the present members. Further details will be found among my\r\npapers, in his and my letters, and some in the Encyclopedie Methodique et\r\nDictionnaire d'Economie Politique, communicated by myself to M. Meusnier,\r\nits author, who had made the establishment of this society the ground,\r\nin that work, of a libel on our country.\r\n\r\nThe want of some authority which should procure justice to the public\r\ncreditors, and an observance of treaties with foreign nations, produced,\r\nsome time after, the call of a convention of the States at Annapolis.\r\nAlthough, at this meeting, a difference of opinion was evident on the\r\nquestion of a republican or kingly government, yet, so general through\r\nthe States was the sentiment in favor of the former, that the friends\r\nof the latter confined themselves to a course of obstruction only, and\r\ndelay, to everything proposed; they hoped, that nothing being done,\r\nand all things going from bad to worse, a kingly government might be\r\nusurped, and submitted to by the people, as better than anarchy and\r\nwars internal and external, the certain consequences of the present\r\nwant of a general government. The effect of their manœuvres, with the\r\ndefective attendance of Deputies from the States, resulted in the measure\r\nof calling a more general convention, to be held at Philadelphia. At\r\nthis, the same party exhibited the same practices, and with the same\r\nviews of preventing a government of concord, which they foresaw would be\r\nrepublican, and of forcing through anarchy their way to monarchy. But\r\nthe mass of that convention was too honest, too wise, and too steady,\r\nto be baffled and misled by their manœuvres. One of these was a form of\r\ngovernment proposed by Colonel Hamilton, which would have been in fact\r\na compromise between the two parties of royalism and republicanism.\r\nAccording to this, the executive and one branch of the legislature were\r\nto be during good behavior, _i. e._ for life, and the governors of the\r\nStates were to be named by these two permanent organs. This, however,\r\nwas rejected; on which Hamilton left the convention, as desperate, and\r\nnever returned again until near its final conclusion. These opinions and\r\nefforts, secret or avowed, of the advocates for monarchy, had begotten\r\ngreat jealousy through the States generally; and this jealousy it was\r\nwhich excited the strong opposition to the conventional constitution;\r\na jealousy which yielded at last only to a general determination to\r\nestablish certain amendments as barriers against a government either\r\nmonarchical or consolidated. In what passed through the whole period\r\nof these conventions, I have gone on the information of those who were\r\nmembers of them, being absent myself on my mission to France.\r\n\r\nI returned from that mission in the first year of the new government,\r\nhaving landed in Virginia in December, 1789, and proceeded to New\r\nYork in March, 1790, to enter on the office of Secretary of State.\r\nHere, certainly, I found a state of things which, of all I had ever\r\ncontemplated, I the least expected. I had left France in the first year of\r\nher revolution, in the fervor of natural rights, and zeal for reformation.\r\nMy conscientious devotion to these rights could not be heightened, but it\r\nhad been aroused and excited by daily exercise. The President received\r\nme cordially, and my colleagues and the circle of principal citizens\r\napparently with welcome. The courtesies of dinner parties given me, as a\r\nstranger newly arrived among them, placed me at once in their familiar\r\nsociety. But I cannot describe the wonder and mortification with which\r\nthe table conversations filled me. Politics were the chief topic, and a\r\npreference of kingly over republican government was evidently the favorite\r\nsentiment. An apostate I could not be, nor yet a hypocrite; and I found\r\nmyself, for the most part, the only advocate on the republican side of\r\nthe question, unless among the guests there chanced to be some member of\r\nthat party from the legislative Houses. Hamilton's financial system had\r\nthen passed. It had two objects; 1st, as a puzzle, to exclude popular\r\nunderstanding and inquiry; 2d, as a machine for the corruption of the\r\nlegislature; for he avowed the opinion, that man could be governed by\r\none of two motives only, force or interest; force, he observed, in this\r\ncountry was out of the question, and the interests, therefore, of the\r\nmembers must be laid hold of, to keep the legislative in unison with\r\nthe executive. And with grief and shame it must be acknowledged that\r\nhis machine was not without effect; that even in this, the birth of our\r\ngovernment, some members were found sordid enough to bend their duty to\r\ntheir interests, and to look after personal rather than public good.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that during the war the greatest difficulty we\r\nencountered was the want of money or means to pay our soldiers who\r\nfought, or our farmers, manufacturers and merchants, who furnished the\r\nnecessary supplies of food and clothing for them. After the expedient of\r\npaper money had exhausted itself, certificates of debt were given to the\r\nindividual creditors, with assurance of payment so soon as the United\r\nStates should be able. But the distresses of these people often obliged\r\nthem to part with these for the half, the fifth, and even a tenth of\r\ntheir value; and speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the\r\nholders by the most fraudulent practices, and persuasions that they would\r\nnever be paid. In the bill for funding and paying these, Hamilton made\r\nno difference between the original holders and the fraudulent purchasers\r\nof this paper. Great and just repugnance arose at putting these two\r\nclasses of creditors on the same footing, and great exertions were used\r\nto pay the former the full value, and to the latter, the price only\r\nwhich they had paid, with interest. But this would have prevented the\r\ngame which was to be played, and for which the minds of greedy members\r\nwere already tutored and prepared. When the trial of strength on these\r\nseveral efforts had indicated the form in which the bill would finally\r\npass, this being known within doors sooner than without, and especially,\r\nthan to those who were in distant parts of the Union, the base scramble\r\nbegan. Couriers and relay horses by land, and swift sailing pilot boats\r\nby sea, were flying in all directions. Active partners and agents were\r\nassociated and employed in every State, town, and country neighborhood,\r\nand this paper was bought up at five shillings, and even as low as two\r\nshillings in the pound, before the holder knew that Congress had already\r\nprovided for its redemption at par. Immense sums were thus filched\r\nfrom the poor and ignorant, and fortunes accumulated by those who had\r\nthemselves been poor enough before. Men thus enriched by the dexterity\r\nof a leader, would follow of course the chief who was leading them to\r\nfortune, and become the zealous instruments of all his enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis game was over, and another was on the carpet at the moment of\r\nmy arrival; and to this I was most ignorantly and innocently made to\r\nhold the candle. This fiscal manœuvre is well known by the name of\r\nthe Assumption. Independently of the debts of Congress, the States had\r\nduring the war contracted separate and heavy debts; and Massachusetts\r\nparticularly, in an absurd attempt, absurdly conducted, on the British\r\npost of Penobscot: and the more debt Hamilton could rake up, the more\r\nplunder for his mercenaries. This money, whether wisely or foolishly\r\nspent, was pretended to have been spent for general purposes, and ought,\r\ntherefore, to be paid from the general purse. But it was objected, that\r\nnobody knew what these debts were, what their amount, or what their\r\nproofs. No matter; we will guess them to be twenty millions. But of\r\nthese twenty millions, we do not know how much should be reimbursed\r\nto one State, or how much to another. No matter; we will guess. And\r\nso another scramble was set on foot among the several States, and some\r\ngot much, some little, some nothing. But the main object was obtained,\r\nthe phalanx of the Treasury was reinforced by additional recruits. This\r\nmeasure produced the most bitter and angry contest ever known in Congress,\r\nbefore or since the Union of the States. I arrived in the midst of it.\r\nBut a stranger to the ground, a stranger to the actors on it, so long\r\nabsent as to have lost all familiarity with the subject, and as yet\r\nunaware of its object, I took no concern in it. The great and trying\r\nquestion, however, was lost in the House of Representatives. So high were\r\nthe feuds excited by this subject, that on its rejection business was\r\nsuspended. Congress met and adjourned from day to day without doing any\r\nthing, the parties being too much out of temper to do business together.\r\nThe eastern members particularly, who, with Smith from South Carolina,\r\nwere the principal gamblers in these scenes, threatened a secession and\r\ndissolution. Hamilton was in despair. As I was going to the President's\r\none day, I met him in the street. He walked me backwards and forwards\r\nbefore the President's door for half an hour. He painted pathetically\r\nthe temper into which the legislature had been wrought; the disgust of\r\nthose who were called the creditor States; the danger of the _secession_\r\nof their members, and the separation of the States. He observed that\r\nthe members of the administration ought to act in concert; that though\r\nthis question was not of my department, yet a common duty should make\r\nit a common concern; that the President was the centre on which all\r\nadministrative questions ultimately rested, and that all of us should\r\nrally around him, and support, with joint efforts, measures approved by\r\nhim; and that the question having been lost by a small majority only, it\r\nwas probable that an appeal from me to the judgment and discretion of\r\nsome of my friends, might effect a change in the vote, and the machine\r\nof government, now suspended, might be again set into motion. I told\r\nhim that I was really a stranger to the whole subject; that not having\r\nyet informed myself of the system of finances adopted, I knew not how\r\nfar this was a necessary sequence; that undoubtedly, if its rejection\r\nendangered a dissolution of our Union at this incipient stage, I should\r\ndeem that the most unfortunate of all consequences, to avert which\r\nall partial and temporary evils should be yielded. I proposed to him,\r\nhowever, to dine with me the next day, and I would invite another friend\r\nor two, bring them into conference together, and I thought it impossible\r\nthat reasonable men, consulting together coolly, could fail, by some\r\nmutual sacrifices of opinion, to form a compromise which was to save\r\nthe Union. The discussion took place. I could take no part in it but an\r\nexhortatory one, because I was a stranger to the circumstances which\r\nshould govern it. But it was finally agreed, that whatever importance\r\nhad been attached to the rejection of this proposition, the preservation\r\nof the Union and of concord among the States was more important, and\r\nthat therefore it would be better that the vote of rejection should be\r\nrescinded, to effect which, some members should change their votes. But\r\nit was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the southern\r\nStates, and that some concomitant measure should be adopted, to sweeten\r\nit a little to them. There had before been propositions to fix the seat\r\nof government either at Philadelphia, or at Georgetown on the Potomac;\r\nand it was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and\r\nto Georgetown permanently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm\r\nin some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure\r\nalone. So two of the Potomac members (White and Lee, but White with a\r\nrevulsion of stomach almost convulsive,) agreed to change their votes,\r\nand Hamilton undertook to carry the other point. In doing this, the\r\ninfluence he had established over the eastern members, with the agency\r\nof Robert Morris with those of the middle States, effected his side of\r\nthe engagement; and so the Assumption was passed, and twenty millions\r\nof stock divided among favored States, and thrown in as a pabulum to the\r\nstockjobbing herd. This added to the number of votaries to the Treasury,\r\nand made its chief the master of every vote in the legislature, which\r\nmight give to the government the direction suited to his political views.\r\n\r\nI know well, and so must be understood, that nothing like a majority in\r\nCongress had yielded to this corruption. Far from it. But a division,\r\nnot very unequal, had already taken place in the honest part of that\r\nbody, between the parties styled republican and federal. The latter being\r\nmonarchists in principle, adhered to Hamilton of course, as their leader\r\nin that principle, and this mercenary phalanx added to them, insured him\r\nalways a majority in both Houses: so that the whole action of legislature\r\nwas now under the direction of the Treasury. Still the machine was not\r\ncomplete. The effect of the funding system, and of the Assumption, would\r\nbe temporary; it would be lost with the loss of the individual members\r\nwhom it has enriched, and some engine of influence more permanent must be\r\ncontrived, while these myrmidons were yet in place to carry it through\r\nall opposition. This engine was the Bank of the United States. All that\r\nhistory is known, so I shall say nothing about it. While the government\r\nremained at Philadelphia, a selection of members of both Houses were\r\nconstantly kept as directors who, on every question interesting to that\r\ninstitution, or to the views of the federal head, voted at the will of\r\nthat head; and, together with the stockholding members, could always make\r\nthe federal vote that of the majority. By this combination, legislative\r\nexpositions were given to the constitution, and all the administrative\r\nlaws were shaped on the model of England, and so passed. And from this\r\ninfluence we were not relieved, until the removal from the precincts of\r\nthe bank, to Washington.\r\n\r\nHere then was the real ground of the opposition which was made to the\r\ncourse of administration. Its object was to preserve the legislature\r\npure and independent of the executive, to restrain the administration\r\nto republican forms and principles, and not permit the constitution to\r\nbe construed into a monarchy, and to be warped, in practice, into all\r\nthe principles and pollutions of their favorite English model. Nor was\r\nthis an opposition to General Washington. He was true to the republican\r\ncharge confided to him; and has solemnly and repeatedly protested to me,\r\nin our conversations, that he would lose the last drop of his blood in\r\nsupport of it; and he did this the oftener and with the more earnestness,\r\nbecause he knew my suspicions of Hamilton's designs against it, and wished\r\nto quiet them. For he was not aware of the drift, or of the effect of\r\nHamilton's schemes. Unversed in financial projects and calculations and\r\nbudgets, his approbation of them was bottomed on his confidence in the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bottomed on\r\ncorruption. In proof of this, I will relate an anecdote, for the truth of\r\nwhich I attest the God who made me. Before the President set out on his\r\nsouthern tour in April, 1791, he addressed a letter of the fourth of that\r\nmonth, from Mount Vernon, to the Secretaries of State, Treasury and War,\r\ndesiring that if any serious and important cases should arise during his\r\nabsence, they would consult and act on them. And he requested that the\r\nVice President should also be consulted. This was the only occasion on\r\nwhich that officer was ever requested to take part in a cabinet question.\r\nSome occasion for consultation arising, I invited those gentlemen (and\r\nthe Attorney General, as well as I remember,) to dine with me, in order\r\nto confer on the subject. After the cloth was removed, and our question\r\nagreed and dismissed, conversation began on other matters, and by some\r\ncircumstance, was led to the British constitution, on which Mr. Adams\r\nobserved, \"purge that constitution of its corruption, and give to its\r\npopular branch equality of representation, and it would be the most\r\nperfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man.\" Hamilton paused and\r\nsaid, \"purge it of its corruption, and give to its popular branch equality\r\nof representation, and it would become an _impracticable_ government:\r\nas it stands at present, with all its supposed defects, it is the most\r\nperfect government which ever existed.\" And this was assuredly the exact\r\nline which separated the political creeds of these two gentlemen. The one\r\nwas for two hereditary branches and an honest elective one: the other,\r\nfor an hereditary King, with a House of Lords and Commons corrupted to\r\nhis will, and standing between him and the people. Hamilton was, indeed,\r\na singular character. Of acute understanding, disinterested, honest,\r\nand honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly\r\nvaluing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the\r\nBritish example, as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was\r\nessential to the government of a nation. Mr. Adams had originally been\r\na republican. The glare of royalty and nobility, during his mission to\r\nEngland, had made him believe their fascination a necessary ingredient\r\nin government; and Shay's rebellion, not sufficiently understood where he\r\nthen was, seemed to prove that the absence of want and oppression, was not\r\na sufficient guarantee of order. His book on the American constitutions\r\nhaving made known his political bias, he was taken up by the monarchical\r\nfederalists in his absence, and on his return to the United States, he\r\nwas by them made to believe that the general disposition of our citizens\r\nwas favorable to monarchy. He here wrote his Davila, as a supplement to\r\na former work, and his election to the Presidency confirmed him in his\r\nerrors. Innumerable addresses too, artfully and industriously poured in\r\nupon him, deceived him into a confidence that he was on the pinnacle of\r\npopularity, when the gulf was yawning at his feet, which was to swallow\r\nup him and his deceivers. For when General Washington was withdrawn,\r\nthese _energumeni_ of royalism, kept in check hitherto by the dread\r\nof his honesty, his firmness, his patriotism, and the authority of his\r\nname, now mounted on the car of State and free from control, like Phaeton\r\non that of the sun, drove headlong and wild, looking neither to right\r\nnor left, nor regarding anything but the objects they were driving at;\r\nuntil, displaying these fully, the eyes of the nation were opened, and\r\na general disbandment of them from the public councils took place.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, I am sure, has been long since convinced of the treacheries\r\nwith which he was surrounded during his administration. He has since\r\nthoroughly seen, that his constituents were devoted to republican\r\ngovernment, and whether his judgment is re-settled on its ancient basis,\r\nor not, he is conformed as a good citizen to the will of the majority,\r\nand would now, I am persuaded, maintain its republican structure with\r\nthe zeal and fidelity belonging to his character. For even an enemy\r\nhas said, \"he is always an honest man, and often a great one.\" But in\r\nthe fervor of the fury and follies of those who made him their stalking\r\nhorse, no man who did not witness it can form an idea of their unbridled\r\nmadness, and the terrorism with which they surrounded themselves. The\r\nhorrors of the French revolution, then raging, aided them mainly, and\r\nusing that as a raw head and bloody bones, they were enabled by their\r\nstratagems of X. Y. Z. in which * * * * * was a leading mountebank, their\r\ntales of tub-plots, ocean massacres, bloody buoys, and pulpit lyings\r\nand slanderings, and maniacal ravings of their Gardeners, their Osgoods\r\nand parishes, to spread alarm into all but the firmest breasts. Their\r\nAttorney General had the impudence to say to a republican member, that\r\ndeportation must be resorted to, of which, said he, \"you republicans\r\nhave set the example;\" thus daring to identify us with the murderous\r\nJacobins of France. These transactions, now recollected but as dreams\r\nof the night, were then sad realities; and nothing rescued us from\r\ntheir liberticide effect, but the unyielding opposition of those firm\r\nspirits who sternly maintained their post in defiance of terror, until\r\ntheir fellow citizens could be aroused to their own danger, and rally\r\nand rescue the standard of the constitution. This has been happily done.\r\nFederalism and monarchism have languished from that moment, until their\r\ntreasonable combinations with the enemies of their country during the\r\nlate war, their plots of dismembering the Union, and their Hartford\r\nconvention, have consigned them to the tomb of the dead; and I fondly\r\nhope, \"we may now truly say, we are all republicans, all federalists,\"\r\nand that the motto of the standard to which our country will forever\r\nrally, will be, \"federal union, and republican government;\" and sure I\r\nam we may say, that we are indebted for the preservation of this point\r\nof ralliance, to that opposition of which so injurious an idea is so\r\nartfully insinuated and excited in this history.\r\n\r\nMuch of this relation is notorious to the world; and many intimate proofs\r\nof it will be found in these notes. From the moment where they end, of my\r\nretiring from the administration, the federalists[8] got unchecked hold\r\nof General Washington. His memory was already sensibly impaired by age,\r\nthe firm tone of mind for which he had been remarkable, was beginning\r\nto relax, its energy was abated, a listlessness of labor, a desire for\r\ntranquillity had crept on him, and a willingness to let others act,\r\nand even think for him. Like the rest of mankind, he was disgusted with\r\natrocities of the French revolution, and was not sufficiently aware of\r\nthe difference between the rabble who were used as instruments of their\r\nperpetration, and the steady and rational character of the American\r\npeople, in which he had not sufficient confidence. The opposition too of\r\nthe republicans to the British treaty, and the zealous support of the\r\nfederalists in that unpopular but favorite measure of theirs, had made\r\nhim all their own. Understanding, moreover, that I disapproved of that\r\ntreaty, and copiously nourished with falsehoods by a malignant neighbor\r\nof mine, who ambitioned to be his correspondent, he had become alienated\r\nfrom myself personally, as from the republican body generally of his\r\nfellow-citizens; and he wrote the letters to Mr. Adams and Mr. Carroll,\r\nover which, in devotion to his imperishable fame, we must forever weep\r\nas monuments of mortal decay.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4th, 1818.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 13th, 1791. Notes of a conversation between Alexander\r\nHamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Th: Jefferson mentioned to him a letter\r\nreceived from John Adams, disavowing Publicola, and denying that he ever\r\nentertained a wish to bring this country under an hereditary executive,\r\nor introduce an hereditary branch of Legislature, &c. See his letter.\r\nAlexander Hamilton condemning Mr. Adams' writings, and most particularly\r\nDavila, as having a tendency to weaken the present government, declared\r\nin substance as follows: \"I own it is my own opinion, though I do not\r\npublish it in Dan or Bersheba, that the present government is not that\r\nwhich will answer the ends of society, by giving stability and protection\r\nto its rights, and that it will probably be found expedient to go into\r\nthe British form. However, since we have undertaken the experiment, I\r\nam for giving it a fair course, whatever my expectations may be. The\r\nsuccess, indeed, so far, is greater than I had expected, and therefore,\r\nat present, success seems more possible than it had done heretofore,\r\nand there are still other and other stages of improvement which, if the\r\npresent does not succeed, may be tried, and ought to be tried, before\r\nwe give up the republican form altogether; for that mind must be really\r\ndepraved, which would not prefer the equality of political rights,\r\nwhich is the foundation of pure republicanism, if it can be obtained\r\nconsistently with order. Therefore, whoever by his writings disturbs the\r\npresent order of things, is really blameable, however pure his intentions\r\nmay be, and he was sure Mr. Adams' were pure.\" This is the substance\r\nof a declaration made in much more lengthy terms, and which seemed to\r\nbe more formal than usual for a private conversation between two, and\r\nas if intended to qualify some less guarded expressions which had been\r\ndropped on former occasions. Th: Jefferson has committed it to writing\r\nin the moment of A. Hamilton's leaving the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 25th, 1791, Colonel Gunn (of Georgia) dining the other\r\nday with Colonel Hamilton, said to him, with that plain freedom he\r\nis known to use, \"I wish, Sir, you would advise your friend King, to\r\nobserve some kind of consistency in his votes. There has been scarcely a\r\nquestion before the Senate on which he has not voted both ways. On the\r\nrepresentation bill, for instance, he first voted for the proposition\r\nof the Representatives, and ultimately voted against it.\" \"Why,\" says\r\nColonel Hamilton, \"I'll tell you as to that, Colonel Gunn, that it never\r\nwas intended that bill should pass.\" Gunn told this to Butler, who told\r\nit to Th: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 28th, 1792. I was to have been with him long enough before\r\nthree o'clock, (which was the hour and day he received visits,) to have\r\nopened to him a proposition for doubling the velocity of the post riders,\r\nwho now travel about fifty miles a day, and might, without difficulty,\r\ngo one hundred, and for taking measures (by way bills) to know where\r\nthe delay is, when there is any. I was delayed by business, so as to\r\nhave scarcely time to give him the outlines. I run over them rapidly,\r\nand observed afterwards, that I had hitherto never spoken to him on the\r\nsubject of the post office, not knowing whether it was considered as a\r\nrevenue law, or a law for the general accommodation of the citizens: that\r\nthe law just passed seemed to have removed the doubt, by declaring that\r\nthe whole profits of the office should be applied to extending the posts,\r\nand that even the past profits should be refunded by the treasury for\r\nthe same purpose: that I therefore conceive it was now in the department\r\nof the Secretary of State: that I thought it would be advantageous so\r\nto declare it for another reason, to wit: that the department of the\r\nTreasury possessed already such an influence as to swallow up the whole\r\nexecutive powers, and that even the future Presidents (not supported by\r\nthe weight of character which himself possessed,) would not be able to\r\nmake head against this department. That in urging this measure I had\r\ncertainly no personal interest, since, if I was supposed to have any\r\nappetite for power, yet as my career would certainly be exactly as short\r\nas his own, the intervening time was too short to be an object. My real\r\nwish was to avail the public of every occasion, during the residue of\r\nthe President's period, to place things on a safe footing. He was now\r\ncalled on to attend his company, and he desired me to come and breakfast\r\nwith him the next morning.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 29th. I did so; and after breakfast we retired to his room,\r\nand I unfolded my plan for the post office, and after such an approbation\r\nof it as he usually permitted himself on the first presentment of any\r\nidea, and desiring me to commit it to writing, he, during that pause of\r\nconversation which follows a business closed, said in an affectionate\r\ntone, that he had felt much concern at an expression which dropped from\r\nme yesterday, and which marked my intention of retiring when he should.\r\nThat as to himself, many motives obliged him to it. He had, through\r\nthe whole course of the war, and most particularly at the close of it,\r\nuniformly declared his resolution to retire from public affairs, and\r\nnever to act in any public office; that he had retired under that firm\r\nresolution: that the government, however, which had been formed, being\r\nfound evidently too inefficacious, and it being supposed that his aid\r\nwas of some consequence towards bringing the people to consent to one\r\nof sufficient efficacy for their own good, he consented to come into the\r\nconvention, and on the same motive, after much pressing, to take a part in\r\nthe new government, and get it under way. That were he to continue longer,\r\nit might give room to say, that having tasted the sweets of office, he\r\ncould not do without them: that he really felt himself growing old, his\r\nbodily health less firm, his memory, always bad, becoming worse, and\r\nperhaps the other faculties of his mind showing a decay to others of which\r\nhe was insensible himself; that this apprehension particularly oppressed\r\nhim: that he found, moreover, his activity lessened, business therefore\r\nmore irksome, and tranquility and retirement become an irresistible\r\npassion. That however he felt himself obliged, for these reasons, to\r\nretire from the government, yet he should consider it as unfortunate,\r\nif that should bring on the retirement of the great officers of the\r\ngovernment, and that this might produce a shock on the public mind of\r\ndangerous consequence.\r\n\r\nI told him that no man had ever had less desire of entering into public\r\noffices than myself; that the circumstance of a perilous war, which\r\nbrought every thing into danger, and called for all the services which\r\nevery citizen could render, had induced me to undertake the administration\r\nof the government of Virginia; that I had both before and after refused\r\nrepeated appointments of Congress to go abroad in that sort of office,\r\nwhich, if I had consulted my own gratification, would almost have been\r\nthe most agreeable to me; that at the end of two years, I resigned the\r\ngovernment of Virginia, and retired with a firm resolution never more to\r\nappear in public life; that a domestic loss, however, happened, and made\r\nme fancy that absence and a change of scene for a time might be expedient\r\nfor me; that I therefore accepted a foreign appointment, limited to two\r\nyears; that at the close of that, Doctor Franklin having left France,\r\nI was appointed to supply his place, which I had accepted, and though\r\nI continued in it three or four years, it was under the constant idea\r\nof remaining only a year or two longer; that the revolution in France\r\ncoming on, I had so interested myself in the event of that, that when\r\nobliged to bring my family home, I had still an idea of returning and\r\nawaiting the close of that, to fix the era of my final retirement; that\r\non my arrival here I found he had appointed me to my present office;\r\nthat he knew I had not come into it without some reluctance; that it\r\nwas, on my part, a sacrifice of inclination to the opinion that I might\r\nbe more serviceable here than in France, and with a firm resolution in\r\nmy mind, to indulge my constant wish for retirement at no very distant\r\nday; that when, therefore, I had received his letter, written from Mount\r\nVernon, on his way to Carolina and Georgia, (April the 1st, 1791) and\r\ndiscovered, from an expression in that, that he meant to retire from\r\nthe government ere long, and as to the precise epoch there could be no\r\ndoubt, my mind was immediately made up; to make that the epoch of my\r\nown retirement from those labors of which I was heartily tired. That,\r\nhowever, I did not believe there was any idea in any of my brethren in\r\nthe administration of retiring; that on the contrary, I had perceived at\r\na late meeting of the trustees of the sinking fund, that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury had developed the plan he intended to pursue, and that\r\nit embraced years in its view.\r\n\r\nHe said, that he considered the Treasury department as a much more\r\nlimited one, going only to the single object of revenue, while\r\nthat of the Secretary of State, embracing nearly all the objects of\r\nadministration, was much more important, and the retirement of the officer\r\ntherefore, would be more noticed: that though the government had set\r\nout with a pretty general good will of the public, yet that symptoms of\r\ndissatisfaction had lately shown themselves far beyond what he could have\r\nexpected, and to what height these might arise, in case of too great a\r\nchange in the administration, could not be foreseen.\r\n\r\nI told him, that in my opinion, there was only a single source of these\r\ndiscontents. Though they had indeed appeared to spread themselves over\r\nthe War department also, yet I considered that as an overflowing only\r\nfrom their real channel, which would never have taken place, if they\r\nhad not first been generated in another department, to wit, that of\r\nthe Treasury. That a system had there been contrived, for deluging the\r\nStates with paper money instead of gold and silver, for withdrawing our\r\ncitizens from the pursuits of commerce, manufactures, buildings, and other\r\nbranches of useful industry, to occupy themselves and their capitals in\r\na species of gambling, destructive of morality, and which had introduced\r\nits poison into the government itself. That it was a fact, as certainly\r\nknown as that he and I were then conversing, that particular members\r\nof the legislature, while those laws were on the carpet, had feathered\r\ntheir nests with paper, had then voted for the laws, and constantly\r\nsince lent all the energy of their talents, and instrumentality of\r\ntheir offices, to the establishment and enlargement of this system; that\r\nthey had chained it about our necks for a great length of time, and in\r\norder to keep the game in their hands had, from time to time, aided in\r\nmaking such legislative constructions of the constitution, as made it\r\na very different thing from what the people thought they had submitted\r\nto; that they had now brought forward a proposition far beyond any one\r\never yet advanced, and to which the eyes of many were turned, as the\r\ndecision which was to let us know, whether we live under a limited or\r\nan unlimited government. He asked me to what proposition I alluded? I\r\nanswered, to that in the report on manufactures, which, under color of\r\ngiving _bounties_ for the encouragement of particular manufactures, meant\r\nto establish the doctrine, that the power given by the constitution to\r\ncollect taxes to provide for the _general welfare_ of the United States,\r\npermitted Congress to take everything under their management which _they_\r\nshould deem for the _public welfare_, and which is susceptible of the\r\napplication of money; consequently, that the subsequent enumeration of\r\ntheir powers was not the description to which resort must be had, and\r\ndid not at all constitute the limits of their authority; that this was\r\na very different question from that of the bank, which was thought an\r\nincident to an enumerated power; that, therefore, this decision was\r\nexpected with great anxiety; that, indeed, I hoped the proposition would\r\nbe rejected, believing there was a majority in both Houses against it,\r\nand that if it should be, it would be considered as a proof that things\r\nwere returning into their true channel; and that, at any rate, I looked\r\nforward to the broad representation which would shortly take place,\r\nfor keeping the general constitution on its true ground; and that this\r\nwould remove a great deal of the discontent which had shown itself. The\r\nconversation ended with this last topic. It is here stated nearly as\r\nmuch at length as it really was; the expressions preserved where I could\r\nrecollect them, and their substance always faithfully stated.\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1792.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of January, 1792, Messrs. Fitzsimmons and Gerry (among others)\r\ndined with me. These two staid, with a Mr. Larned of Connecticut,\r\nafter the company was gone. We got on the subject of references by the\r\nlegislature to the Heads of departments, considering their mischief in\r\nevery direction. Gerry and Fitzsimmons clearly opposed to them.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards (January the 4th), Mr. Bourne from Rhode Island\r\npresented a memorial from his State, complaining of inequality in the\r\nAssumption, and moved to refer it to the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nFitzsimmons, Gerry and others opposed it; but it was carried.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 19th. Fitzsimmons moved, that the _President of the United\r\nStates_ be requested to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, to\r\nlay before the House information to enable the legislature to judge\r\nof the additional revenue necessary on the increase of the military\r\nestablishment. The House, on debate, struck out the words, \"President\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMarch the 7th. The subject resumed. An animated debate took place on the\r\ntendency of references to the Heads of departments; and it seemed that a\r\ngreat majority would be against it; the House adjourned. Treasury greatly\r\nalarmed, and much industry supposed to be used before next morning,\r\nwhen it was brought on again, and debated through the day, and on the\r\nquestion, the Treasury carried it by thirty-one to twenty-seven; but\r\ndeeply wounded, since it was seen that all Pennsylvania, except Jacobs,\r\nvoted against the reference; that Tucker of South Carolina voted for it,\r\nand Sumpter absented himself, debauched for the moment only, because of\r\nthe connection of the question with a further Assumption which South\r\nCarolina favored; but showing that they never were to be counted on\r\namong the Treasury votes. Some others absented themselves. Gerry changed\r\nsides. On the whole, it showed that Treasury influence was tottering.\r\n\r\nCommitted to writing this 10th of March, 1792.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th, 1792. Consulted verbally by the President, on whom a\r\ncommittee of the Senate (Izard, Morris, and King) are to wait to-morrow\r\nmorning, to know whether he will think it proper to redeem our Algerine\r\ncaptives, and make a treaty with the Algerines, on the single vote of\r\nthe Senate, without taking that of the Representatives.\r\n\r\nMy opinions run on the following heads:\r\n\r\nWe must go to Algiers with cash in our hands. Where shall we get it? By\r\nloan? By converting money now in the treasury?\r\n\r\nProbably a loan might be obtained on the President's authority; but as\r\nthis could not be repaid without a subsequent act of legislature, the\r\nRepresentatives might refuse it. So if money in the treasury be converted,\r\nthey may refuse to sanction it.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent approbation of the Senate being necessary to validate a\r\ntreaty, they expect to be consulted beforehand, if the case admits.\r\n\r\nSo the subsequent act of the Representatives being necessary where money\r\nis given, why should not they expect to be consulted in like manner, when\r\nthe case admits. A treaty is a law of the land. But prudence will point\r\nout this difference to be attended to in making them; viz. where a treaty\r\ncontains such articles only as will go into execution of themselves, or\r\nbe carried into execution by the judges, they may be safely made; but\r\nwhere there are articles which require a law to be passed afterwards by\r\nthe legislature, great caution is requisite.\r\n\r\nFor example; the consular convention with France required a very small\r\nlegislative regulation. This convention was unanimously ratified by the\r\nSenate. Yet the same identical men threw by the law to enforce it at\r\nthe last session, and the Representatives at this session have placed it\r\namong the laws which they may take up or not, at their own convenience,\r\nas if that was a higher motive than the public faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore, against hazarding this transaction without the sanction of\r\nboth Houses.\r\n\r\nThe President concurred. The Senate express the motive for this\r\nproposition, to be a fear that the Representatives would not keep the\r\nsecret. He has no opinion of the secrecy of the Senate. In this very\r\ncase, Mr. Izard made the communication to him, sitting next to him at\r\ntable, on one hand, while a lady (Mrs. McLane) was on his other hand,\r\nand the French minister next to her; and as Mr. Izard got on with his\r\ncommunication, his voice kept rising, and his stutter bolting the words\r\nout loudly at intervals, so that the minister might hear if he would.\r\nHe said he had a great mind at one time to have got up, in order to put\r\na stop to Mr. Izard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th, 1792. Mr. Sterret tells me, that sitting round a fire\r\nthe other day with four or five others, [Mr. Smith of South Carolina\r\nwas one], somebody mentioned that the murderers of Hogeboom, sheriff of\r\nColumbia county, New York, were acquitted. \"Aye,\" says Smith, \"this is\r\nwhat comes of your damned _trial by jury_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1791. Towards the latter end of November, Hamilton had drawn Ternant into\r\na conversation on the subject of the treaty of commerce recommended by\r\nthe National Assembly of France to be negotiated with us, and, as he had\r\nno ready instructions on the subject, he led him into a proposal that\r\nTernant should take the thing up as a volunteer with me, that we should\r\narrange conditions, and let them go for confirmation or refusal. Hamilton\r\ncommunicated this to the President, who came into it, and proposed it to\r\nme. I disapproved of it, observing, that such a volunteer project would\r\nbe binding on us, and not them; that it would enable them to find out\r\nhow far we would go, and avail themselves of it. However, the President\r\nthought it worth trying, and I acquiesced. I prepared a plan of treaty\r\nfor exchanging the privileges of native subjects, and fixing all duties\r\nforever as they now stood. Hamilton did not like this way of fixing the\r\nduties, because, he said, many articles here would bear to be raised,\r\nand therefore, he would prepare a tariff. He did so, raising duties for\r\nthe French, from twenty-five to fifty per cent. So they were to give\r\nus the privileges of native subjects, and we, as a compensation, were\r\nto make them pay higher duties. Hamilton, having made his arrangements\r\nwith Hammond to pretend that though he had no powers to conclude a\r\ntreaty of commerce, yet his general commission authorized him to enter\r\ninto the discussion of one, then proposed to the President at one of\r\nour meetings, that the business should be taken up with Hammond in the\r\nsame informal way. I now discovered the trap which he had laid, by first\r\ngetting the President into that step with Ternant. I opposed the thing\r\nwarmly. Hamilton observed, if we did it with Ternant we should also\r\nwith Hammond. The President thought this reasonable. I desired him to\r\nrecollect, I had been against it with Ternant, and only acquiesced under\r\nhis opinion. So the matter went off as to both. His scheme evidently\r\nwas, to get us engaged first with Ternant, merely that he might have\r\na pretext to engage us on the same ground with Hammond, taking care,\r\nat the same time, by an extravagant tariff, to render it impossible we\r\nshould come to any conclusion with Ternant: probably meaning, at the same\r\ntime, to propose terms so favorable to Great Britain, as would attach\r\nus to that country by treaty. On one of those occasions he asserted,\r\nthat our commerce with Great Britain and her colonies was put on a much\r\nmore favorable footing than with France and her colonies. I therefore\r\nprepared the tabular comparative view of the footing of our commerce\r\nwith those nations, which see among my papers. See also my project of\r\na treaty and Hamilton's tariff.\r\n\r\nCommitted to writing March the 11th, 1792.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was observable, that whenever, at any of our consultations, anything\r\nwas proposed as to Great Britain, Hamilton had constantly ready something\r\nwhich Mr. Hammond had communicated to him, which suited the subject and\r\nproved the intimacy of their communications; insomuch, that I believe\r\nhe communicated to Hammond all our views, and knew from him, in return,\r\nthe views of the British court. Many evidences of this occurred; I will\r\nstate some. I delivered to the President my report of instructions\r\nfor Carmichael and Short, on the subject of navigation, boundary and\r\ncommerce, and desired him to submit it to Hamilton. Hamilton made several\r\njust criticisms on different parts of it. But where I asserted that the\r\nUnited States had no right to alienate an inch of the territory of any\r\nState, he attacked and denied the doctrine. See my report, his note, and\r\nmy answer. A few days after came to hand Kirkland's letter, informing\r\nus that the British, at Niagara, expected to run a new line between\r\nthemselves and us; and the reports of Pond and Stedman, informing us it\r\nwas understood at Niagara, that Captain Stevenson had been sent here by\r\nSimcoe to settle that plan with Hammond. Hence Hamilton's attack of the\r\nprinciple I had laid down, in order to prepare the way for this new line.\r\nSee minute of March the 9th. Another proof. At one of our consultations,\r\nabout the last of December, I mentioned that I wished to give in my\r\nreport on commerce, in which I could not avoid recommending a commercial\r\nretaliation against Great Britain. Hamilton opposed it violently; and\r\namong other arguments, observed, that it was of more importance to us\r\nto have the posts than to commence a commercial war; that this, and\r\nthis alone, would free us from the expense of the Indian wars; that it\r\nwould therefore be the height of imprudence in us, while treating for\r\nthe surrender of the posts, to engage in anything which would irritate\r\nthem; that if we did so, they would naturally say, \"these people mean\r\nwar, let us therefore hold what we have in our hands.\" This argument\r\nstruck me forcibly, and I said, \"if there is a hope of obtaining the\r\nposts, I agree it would be imprudent to risk that hope by a commercial\r\nretaliation. I will, therefore, wait till Mr. Hammond gives me in his\r\nassignment of breaches, and if that gives a glimmering of hope that they\r\nmean to surrender the posts, I will not give in my report till the next\r\nsession.\" Now, Hammond had received my assignment of breaches on the\r\n15th of December, and about the 22d or 23d had made me an apology for\r\nnot having been able to send me his counter-assignment of breaches; but\r\nin terms which showed I might expect it in a few days. From the moment\r\nit escaped my lips in the presence of Hamilton, that I would not give in\r\nmy report till I should see Hammond's counter-complaint, and judge if\r\nthere was a hope of the posts, Hammond never said a word to me on any\r\noccasion, as to the time he should be ready. At length the President\r\ngot out of patience, and insisted I should jog him. This I did on the\r\n21st of February, at the President's assembly: he immediately promised\r\nI should have it in a few days, and accordingly, on the 5th of March I\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\nWritten March the 11th, 1792.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th, 1792. Sent for by the President, and desired to bring\r\nthe letter he had signed to the King of France. Went. He said the House\r\nof Representatives had, on Saturday, taken up the communication he had\r\nmade of the King's letter to him, and come to a vote in their own name;\r\nthat he did not expect this when he sent this message and the letter,\r\notherwise he would have sent the message without the letter, as I had\r\nproposed. That he apprehended the legislature would be endeavoring to\r\ninvade the executive. I told him, I had understood the House had resolved\r\nto request him to join their congratulations to his on the completion\r\nand acceptance of the constitution; on which part of the vote, there\r\nwere only two dissentients, (Barnwell and Benson;) that the vote was\r\nthirty-five to sixteen on that part which expressed an approbation of\r\nthe wisdom of the constitution; that in the letter he had signed, I had\r\navoided saying a word in approbation of the constitution, not knowing\r\nwhether the King, in his heart, approved it. Why, indeed, says he, I\r\nbegin to doubt very much of the affairs of France; there are papers from\r\nLondon as late as the 10th of January, which represent them as going\r\ninto confusion. He read over the letter he had signed, found there was\r\nnot a word which could commit his judgment about the constitution, and\r\ngave it to me back again. This is one of many proofs I have had, of his\r\nwant of confidence in the event of the French revolution. The fact is,\r\nthat Governeur Morris, a high-flying monarchy man, shutting his eyes and\r\nhis faith to every fact against his wishes, and believing everything he\r\ndesires to be true, has kept the President's mind constantly poisoned\r\nwith his forebodings. That the President wishes the revolution may be\r\nestablished, I believe from several indications. I remember, when I\r\nreceived the news of the King's flight and capture, I first told him of\r\nit at his assembly. I never saw him so much dejected by any event in my\r\nlife. He expressed clearly, on this occasion, his disapprobation of the\r\nlegislature referring things to the Heads of departments.\r\n\r\nWritten March the 12th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eodem die._ Ten o'clock, A. M. The preceding was about nine o'clock.\r\nThe President now sends Lear to me, to ask what answer he shall give\r\nto the committee, and particularly, whether he shall add to it, that,\r\n\"in making the communication, it was not his expectation that the House\r\nshould give any answer.\" I told Mr. Lear that I thought the House had\r\na right, independently of legislation, to express sentiments on other\r\nsubjects. That when these subjects did not belong to any other branch\r\nparticularly, they would publish them by their own authority; that in\r\nthe present case, which respected a foreign nation, the President being\r\nthe organ of our nation with other nations, the House would satisfy\r\ntheir duty, if, instead of a direct communication, they should pass\r\ntheir sentiments through the President; that if expressing a sentiment\r\nwere really an invasion of the executive power, it was so faint a one,\r\nthat it would be difficult to demonstrate it to the public, and to a\r\npublic partial to the French revolution, and not disposed to consider\r\nthe approbation of it from any quarter as improper. That the Senate,\r\nindeed, had given many indications of their wish to invade the executive\r\npower: the Representatives had done it in one case, which was indeed\r\nmischievous and alarming; that of giving orders to the Heads of the\r\nexecutive departments, without consulting the President; but that the\r\nlate vote for directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report ways\r\nand means, though carried, was carried by so small a majority, and\r\nwith the aid of members so notoriously under a local influence on that\r\nquestion, as to give a hope that the practice would be arrested, and\r\nthe constitutional course be taken up, of asking the President to have\r\ninformation laid before them. But that in the present instance, it was\r\nso far from being clearly an invasion of the executive, and would be\r\nso little approved by the general voice, that I could not advise the\r\nPresident to express any dissatisfaction at the vote of the House; and\r\nI gave Lear, in writing, what I thought should be his answers. See it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 31st. A meeting at the President's; present, Thomas Jefferson,\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Henry Knox and Edmond Randolph. The subject was\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives, of March the 27th, to\r\nappoint a committee to inquire into the causes of the failure of the late\r\nexpedition under Major General St. Clair, with the power to call for\r\nsuch persons, papers and records, as may be necessary to assist their\r\ninquiries. The committee had written to Knox for the original letters,\r\ninstructions, &c. The President had called us to consult, merely because\r\nit was the first example, and he wished that so far as it should become\r\na precedent, it should be rightly conducted. He neither acknowledged nor\r\ndenied, nor even doubted the propriety of what the House were doing,\r\nfor he had not thought upon it, nor was acquainted with subjects of\r\nthis kind: he could readily conceive there might be papers of so secret\r\na nature, as that they ought not to be given up. We were not prepared,\r\nand wished time to think and inquire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 2d. Met again at the President's, on the same subject. We\r\nhad all considered, and were of one mind, first, that the House was an\r\ninquest, and therefore might institute inquiries. Second, that it might\r\ncall for papers generally. Third, that the executive ought to communicate\r\nsuch papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those,\r\nthe disclosure of which would injure the public: consequently were to\r\nexercise a discretion. Fourth, that neither the committee nor House\r\nhad a right to call on the Head of a department, who and whose papers\r\nwere under the President alone; but that the committee should instruct\r\ntheir chairman to move the House to address the President. We had\r\nprincipally consulted the proceedings of the Commons in the case of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, 13 Chandler's Debates. For the first point, see pages\r\n161, 170, 172, 183, 187, 207; for the second, pages 153, 173, 207; for\r\nthe third, 81, 173, appendix page 44; fourth, page 246. Note; Hamilton\r\nagreed with us in all these points, except as to the power of the House\r\nto call on Heads of departments. He observed, that as to his department,\r\nthe act constituting it had made it subject to Congress in some points,\r\nbut he thought himself not so far subject, as to be obliged to produce\r\nall the papers they might call for. They might demand secrets of a very\r\nmischievous nature. [Here I thought he began to fear they would go on to\r\nexamining how far their own members and other persons in the government\r\nhad been dabbling in stocks, banks, &c., and that he probably would\r\nchoose in this case to deny their power; and, in short, he endeavored to\r\nplace himself subject to the House, when the executive should propose\r\nwhat he did not like, and subject to the executive, when the House\r\nshould propose anything disagreeable.] I observed here a difference\r\nbetween the British parliament and our Congress; that the former was a\r\nlegislature, an inquest, and a council (S. C. page 91.) for the King.\r\nThe latter was, by the constitution, a legislature and an inquest, but\r\nnot a council. Finally agreed, to speak separately to the members of\r\nthe committee, and bring them by persuasion into the right channel. It\r\nwas agreed in this case, that there was not a paper which might not be\r\nproperly produced; that copies only should be sent, with an assurance,\r\nthat if they should desire it, a clerk should attend with the originals\r\nto be verified by themselves. The committee were Fitzsimmons, Steele,\r\nMercer, Clarke, Sedgwick, Giles and Vining.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 9th, 1792. The President had wished to redeem our captives at\r\nAlgiers, and to make peace with them on paying an annual tribute. The\r\nSenate were willing to approve this, but unwilling to have the lower House\r\napplied to previously to furnish the money; they wished the President to\r\ntake the money from the treasury, or open a loan for it. They thought\r\nthat to consult the Representatives on one occasion, would give them a\r\nhandle always to claim it, and would let them into a participation of the\r\npower of making treaties, which the constitution had given exclusively\r\nto the President and Senate. They said too, that if the particular\r\nsum was voted by the Representatives, it would not be a secret. The\r\nPresident had no confidence in the secrecy of the Senate, and did not\r\nchoose to take money from the treasury or to borrow. But he agreed he\r\nwould enter into provisional treaties with the Algerines, not to be\r\nbinding on us till ratified here. I prepared questions for consultation\r\nwith the Senate, and added, that the Senate were to be apprized, that on\r\nthe return of the provisional treaty, and after they should advise the\r\nratification, he would not have the seal put to it till the two Houses\r\nshould vote the money. He asked me, if the treaty stipulating a sum and\r\nratified by him, with the advice of the Senate, would not be good under\r\nthe constitution, and obligatory on the Representatives to furnish the\r\nmoney? I answered it certainly would, and that it would be the duty of\r\nthe Representatives to raise the money; but that they might decline to\r\ndo what was their duty, and I thought it might be incautious to commit\r\nhimself by a ratification with a foreign nation, where he might be left\r\nin the lurch in the execution: it was possible too, to conceive a treaty,\r\nwhich it would not be their duty to provide for. He said that he did\r\nnot like throwing too much into democratic hands, that if they would not\r\ndo what the constitution called on them to do, the government would be\r\nat an end, and must _then assume another form_. He stopped here; and I\r\nkept silence to see whether he would say anything more in the same line,\r\nor add any qualifying expression to soften what he had said; but he did\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nI had observed, that wherever the agency of either, or both Houses would\r\nbe requisite subsequent to a treaty, to carry it into effect, it would be\r\nprudent to consult them previously, if the occasion admitted. That thus\r\nit was, we were in the habit of consulting the Senate previously, when\r\nthe occasion permitted, because their subsequent ratification would be\r\nnecessary. That there was the same reason for consulting the lower House\r\npreviously, where they were to be called on afterwards, and especially in\r\nthe case of money, as they held the purse strings, and would be jealous\r\nof them. However, he desired me to strike out the intimation that the\r\nseal would not be put till both Houses should have voted the money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 6th. The President called on me before breakfast, and first\r\nintroduced some other matter, then fell on the representation bill,\r\nwhich he had now in his possession for the tenth day I had before\r\ngiven him my opinion in writing, that the method of apportionment was\r\ncontrary to the constitution. He agreed that it was contrary to the\r\ncommon understanding of that instrument, and to what was understood at\r\nthe time by the makers of it; that yet it would bear the construction\r\nwhich the bill put, and he observed that the vote for and against the\r\nbill was perfectly geographical, a northern against a southern vote, and\r\nhe feared he should be thought to be taking side with a southern party.\r\nI admitted the motive of delicacy, but that it should not induce him to\r\ndo wrong; urged the dangers to which the scramble for the fractionary\r\nmembers would always lead. He here expressed his fear that there would,\r\nere long, be a separation of the Union; that the public mind seemed\r\ndissatisfied and tending to this. He went home, sent for Randolph, the\r\nAttorney General, desired him to get Mr. Madison immediately and come\r\nto me, and if we three concurred in opinion that he should negative the\r\nbill, he desired to hear nothing more about it, but that we would draw\r\nthe instrument for him to sign. They came. Our minds had been before\r\nmade up. We drew the instrument. Randolph carried it to him, and told\r\nhim we all concurred in it. He walked with him to the door, and as if\r\nhe still wished to get off, he said, \"and you say you approve of this\r\nyourself.\" \"Yes Sir,\" says Randolph, \"I do upon my honor.\" He sent it\r\nto the House of Representatives instantly. A few of the hottest friends\r\nof the bill expressed passion, but the majority were satisfied, and both\r\nin and out of doors it gave pleasure to have, at length, an instance of\r\nthe negative being exercised.\r\n\r\nWritten this the 9th of April.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly the 10th, 1792. My letter of ---- to the President, directed to\r\nhim at Mount Vernon, had not found him there, but came to him here. He\r\ntold me of this, and that he would take an occasion of speaking with\r\nme on the subject. He did so this day. He began by observing that he\r\nhad put it off from day to day because the subject was painful, to wit,\r\nhis remaining in office, which that letter solicited. He said that the\r\ndeclaration he had made when he quitted his military command, of never\r\nagain entering into public life, was sincere. That, however, when he\r\nwas called on to come forward to set the present government in motion,\r\nit appeared to him that circumstances were so changed as to justify a\r\nchange in his resolution: he was made to believe that in two years all\r\nwould be well in motion, and he might retire. At the end of two years\r\nhe found some things still to be done. At the end of the third year,\r\nhe thought it was not worth while to disturb the course of things, as\r\nin one year more his office would expire, and he was decided then to\r\nretire. Now he was told there would still be danger in it. Certainly,\r\nif he thought so, he would conquer his longing for retirement. But he\r\nfeared it would be said his former professions of retirement had been\r\nmere affectation, and that he was like other men, when once in office\r\nhe could not quit it. He was sensible, too, of a decay of his hearing,\r\nperhaps his other faculties might fall off and he not be sensible of\r\nit. That with respect to the existing causes of uneasiness, he thought\r\nthere were suspicions against a particular party, which had been\r\ncarried a great deal too far; there might be _desires_, but he did not\r\nbelieve there were _designs_ to change the form of government into a\r\nmonarchy; that there might be a few who wished it in the higher walks\r\nof life, particularly in the great cities, but that the main body of\r\nthe people in the eastern States were as steadily for republicanism as\r\nin the southern. That the pieces lately published, and particularly in\r\nFreneau's paper, seemed to have in view the exciting opposition to the\r\ngovernment. That this had taken place in Pennsylvania as to the excise\r\nlaw, according to information he had received from General Hand. That\r\nthey tended to produce a separation of the Union, the most dreadful of\r\nall calamities, and that whatever tended to produce anarchy, tended, of\r\ncourse, to produce a resort to monarchical government. He considered\r\nthose papers as attacking him directly, for he must be a fool indeed\r\nto swallow the little sugar plums here and there thrown out to him.\r\nThat in condemning the administration of the government, they condemned\r\nhim, for if they thought there were measures pursued contrary to his\r\nsentiments, they must conceive him too careless to attend to them, or\r\ntoo stupid to understand them. That though, indeed, he had signed many\r\nacts which he did not approve in all their parts, yet he had never put\r\nhis name to one which he did not think, on the whole, was eligible. That\r\nas to the bank, which had been an act of so much complaint, until there\r\nwas some infallible criterion of reason, a difference of opinion must\r\nbe tolerated. He did not believe the discontents extended far from the\r\nseat of government. He had seen and spoken with many people in Maryland\r\nand Virginia in his late journey. He found the people contented and\r\nhappy. He wished, however, to be better informed on this head. If the\r\ndiscontents were more extensive than he supposed, it might be that the\r\ndesire that he should remain in the government was not general.\r\n\r\nMy observations to him tended principally to enforce the topics of my\r\nletter. I will not, therefore, repeat them, except where they produced\r\nobservations from him. I said that the two great complaints were, that\r\nthe national debt was unnecessarily increased, and that it had furnished\r\nthe means of corrupting both branches of the legislature; that he must\r\nknow, and everybody knew, there was a considerable squadron in both,\r\nwhose votes were devoted to the paper and stock-jobbing interest, that\r\nthe names of a weighty number were known, and several others suspected\r\non good grounds. That on examining the votes of these men, they would\r\nbe found uniformly for every Treasury measure, and that as most of these\r\nmeasures had been carried by small majorities, they were carried by these\r\nvery votes. That, therefore, it was a cause of just uneasiness, when we\r\nsaw a legislature legislating for their own interests, in opposition\r\nto those of the people. He said not a word on the corruption of the\r\nlegislature, but took up the other point, defended the Assumption, and\r\nargued that it had not increased the debt, for that all of it was honest\r\ndebt. He justified the excise law, as one of the best laws which could\r\nbe passed, as nobody would pay the tax who did not choose to do it.\r\nWith respect to the increase of the debt by the Assumption, I observed\r\nto him that what was meant and objected to was, that it increased the\r\ndebt of the General Government, and carried it beyond the possibility of\r\npayment. That if the balances had been settled, and the debtor States\r\ndirected to pay their deficiencies to the creditor States, they would\r\nhave done it easily, and by resources of taxation in their power, and\r\nacceptable to the people; by a direct tax in the south, and an excise\r\nin the north. Still, he said, it would be paid by the people. Finding\r\nhim decided, I avoided entering into argument with him on those points.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSept. the 30th, 1792. The constitution as agreed to till a fortnight\r\nbefore the Convention rose, was such a one as he would have set his hand\r\nand heart to. 1st. The President was to be elected for seven years. Then\r\nineligible for seven years more. 2d. Rotation in the Senate. 3d. A vote\r\nof two-thirds in the legislature on particular subjects, and expressly\r\non that of navigation. The three New England States were constantly with\r\nus in all questions (Rhode Island not there, and New York seldom), so\r\nthat it was these three States, with the five southern ones, against\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the importation of slaves, it was left to Congress.\r\nThis disturbed the two southernmost States, who knew that Congress\r\nwould immediately suppress the importation of slaves. These two States,\r\ntherefore, struck up a bargain with the three New England States. If they\r\nwould join to admit slaves for some years, the southernmost States would\r\njoin in changing the clause which required two-thirds of the legislature\r\nin any vote. It was done. These articles were changed accordingly, and\r\nfrom that moment the two southernmost States, and the three northern ones,\r\njoined Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, and made the majority eight\r\nto three against us, instead of eight to three for us, as it had been\r\nthrough the whole Convention. Under this coalition, the great principles\r\nof the constitution were changed in the last days of the Convention.\r\n\r\nAnecdote. Yates, Lawsing and Hamilton represented New York. Yates and\r\nLawsing never voted in one single instance with Hamilton, who was so\r\nmuch mortified at it that he went home. When the season for courts came\r\non, Yates, a judge, and Lawsing, a lawyer, went to attend their courts.\r\nThen Hamilton returned.\r\n\r\nAnecdote. The constitution as agreed at first was, that amendments\r\nmight be proposed either by Congress or the legislatures. A committee\r\nwas appointed to digest and redraw. Governeur Morris and King were of\r\nthe committee. One morning Governeur Morris moved an instrument for\r\ncertain alterations (not one-half the members yet come in). In a hurry\r\nand without understanding, it was agreed to. The committee reported so\r\nthat Congress should have the exclusive power of proposing amendments.\r\nGeorge Mason observed it on the report, and opposed it. King denied\r\nthe construction. Mason demonstrated it, and asked the committee by\r\nwhat authority they had varied what had been agreed. Governeur Morris\r\nthen imprudently got up, and said, by authority of the Convention, and\r\nproduced the blind instruction before mentioned, which was unknown by\r\none-half of the House, and not till then understood by the other. They\r\nthen restored it, as it originally stood.\r\n\r\nHe said he considered Hamilton as having done us more injury than Great\r\nBritain and all her fleets and armies. That his (Mason's) plan of settling\r\nour debts would have been something in this way. He would have laid as\r\nmuch tax as could be paid without oppressing the people;--particularly\r\nhe would have laid an impost of about the amount of the first, laid by\r\nCongress, but somewhat different in several of its articles. He would\r\nhave suspended all application of it one year, during which an office\r\nshould have been open to register unalienated certificates. At the end of\r\nthe year he would have appropriated his revenue. 1st. To pay the civil\r\nlist. 2d. The interest of these certificates. 3d. Instalments of the\r\nprincipal. 4th. A surplus to buy up the alienated certificates, still\r\navoiding to make any other provision for these last. By the time the\r\nunalienated certificates should have been all paid, he supposed half the\r\nalienated ones would have been bought up at market. He would then have\r\nproceeded to redeem the residue of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBladensburg, October the 1st, 1792. This morning, at Mount Vernon, I had\r\nthe following conversation with the President. He opened it by expressing\r\nhis regret at the resolution in which I appeared so fixed, in the letter I\r\nhad written him, of retiring from public affairs. He said, that he should\r\nbe extremely sorry that I should do it, as long as he was in office, and\r\nthat he could not see where he should find another character to fill my\r\noffice. That, as yet, he was quite undecided whether to retire in March\r\nor not. His inclinations led him strongly to do it. Nobody disliked\r\nmore the ceremonies of his office, and he had not the least taste or\r\ngratification in the execution of its functions. That he was happy at\r\nhome alone, and that his presence there was now peculiarly called for by\r\nthe situation of Major Washington, whom he thought irrecoverable, and\r\nshould he get well, he would remove into another part of the country,\r\nwhich might better agree with him. That he did not believe his presence\r\nnecessary; that there were other characters who would do the business\r\nas well or better. Still, however, if his aid was thought necessary to\r\nsave the cause to which he had devoted his life principally, he would\r\nmake the sacrifice of a longer continuance. That he therefore reserved\r\nhimself for future decision, as his declaration would be in time if made\r\na month before the day of election. He had desired Mr. Lear to find out\r\nfrom conversation, without appearing to make the inquiry, whether any\r\nother person would be desired by any body. He had informed him, he judged\r\nfrom conversations that it was the universal desire he should continue,\r\nand he believed that those who expressed a doubt of his continuance, did\r\nit in the language of apprehension, and not of desire. But this, says\r\nhe, is only from the north; it may be very different in the south. I\r\nthought this meant as an opening to me to say what was the sentiment in\r\nthe south, from which quarter I came. I told him, that as far as I knew,\r\nthere was but one voice there, which was for his continuance. That as\r\nto myself, I had ever preferred the pursuits of private life to those\r\nof public, which had nothing in them agreeable to me. I explained to\r\nhim the circumstances of the war which had first called me into public\r\nlife, and those following the war, which had called me from a retirement\r\non which I had determined. That I had constantly kept my eye on my own\r\nhome, and could no longer refrain from returning to it. As to himself,\r\nhis presence was important; that he was the only man in the United States\r\nwho possessed the confidence of the whole; that government was founded\r\nin opinion and confidence, and that the longer he remained, the stronger\r\nwould become the habits of the people in submitting to the government,\r\nand in thinking it a thing to be maintained; that there was no other\r\nperson who would be thought anything more than the head of a party. He\r\nthen expressed his concern at the difference which he found to subsist\r\nbetween the Secretary of the Treasury and myself, of which he said he\r\nhad not been aware. He knew, indeed, that there was a marked difference\r\nin our political sentiments, but he had never suspected it had gone so\r\nfar in producing a personal difference, and he wished he could be the\r\nmediator to put an end to it. That he thought it important to preserve\r\nthe check of my opinions in the administration, in order to keep things\r\nin their proper channel, and prevent them from going too far. That as\r\nto the idea of transforming this government into a monarchy, he did not\r\nbelieve there were ten men in the United States whose opinions were worth\r\nattention, who entertained such a thought. I told him there were many\r\nmore than he imagined. I recalled to his memory a dispute at his own\r\ntable, a little before we left Philadelphia, between General Schuyler\r\non one side and Pinckney and myself on the other, wherein the former\r\nmaintained the position, that hereditary descent was as likely to produce\r\ngood magistrates as election. I told him, that though the people were\r\nsound, there were a numerous sect who had monarchy in contemplation; that\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury was one of these. That I had heard him say\r\nthat this constitution was a shilly shally thing, of mere milk and water,\r\nwhich could not last, and was only good as a step to something better.\r\nThat when we reflected, that he had endeavored in the convention, to\r\nmake an English constitution of it, and when failing in that, we saw all\r\nhis measures tending to bring it to the same thing, it was natural for\r\nus to be jealous; and particularly, when we saw that these measures had\r\nestablished corruption in the legislature, where there was a squadron\r\ndevoted to the nod of the Treasury, doing whatever he had directed, and\r\nready to do what he should direct. That if the equilibrium of the three\r\ngreat bodies, legislative, executive and judiciary, could be preserved,\r\nif the legislature could be kept independent, I should never fear the\r\nresult of such a government; but that I could not but be uneasy, when I\r\nsaw that the executive had swallowed up the legislative branch. He said,\r\nthat as to that interested spirit in the legislature, it was what could\r\nnot be avoided in any government, unless we were to exclude particular\r\ndescriptions of men, such as the holders of the funds, from all office.\r\nI told him, there was great difference between the little accidental\r\nschemes of self-interest, which would take place in every body of men,\r\nand influence their votes, and a regular system for forming a corps of\r\ninterested persons, who should be steadily at the orders of the Treasury.\r\nHe touched on the merits of the funding system, observed there was a\r\ndifference of opinion about it, some thinking it very bad, others very\r\ngood; that experience was the only criterion of right which he knew, and\r\nthis alone would decide which opinion was right. That for himself, he had\r\nseen our affairs desperate and our credit lost, and that this was in a\r\nsudden and extraordinary degree raised to the highest pitch. I told him,\r\nall that was ever necessary to establish our credit, was an efficient\r\ngovernment and an honest one, declaring it would sacredly pay our debts,\r\nlaying taxes for this purpose, and applying them to it. I avoided going\r\nfurther into the subject. He finished by another exhortation to me not to\r\ndecide too positively on retirement, and here we were called to breakfast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober the 31st, 1792. I had sent to the President, Viar and Jaudenes's\r\nletter of the 29th instant, whereupon he desired a consultation of\r\nHamilton, Knox, E. Randolph, and myself, on these points: 1. What notice\r\nwas to be taken hereof to Spain? 2. Whether it should make part of the\r\ncommunication to the legislature? I delivered my opinion, that it ought\r\nto be communicated to both Houses, because the communications intended to\r\nbe made, being to bring on the question, whether they would declare war\r\nagainst any, and which of the nations or parts of the nations of Indians\r\nto the south, it would be proper this information should be before them,\r\nthat they might know how far such a declaration would lead them. There\r\nmight be some who would be for war against the Indians, if it were to\r\nstop there, but who would not be for it, if it were to lead to a war\r\nagainst Spain. I thought it should be laid before both Houses, because it\r\nconcerned the question of declaring war, which was the function equally\r\nof both Houses. I thought a simple acknowledgment of the receipt of the\r\nletter should be made by me to the Spanish Chargés, expressing that it\r\ncontained some things very unexpected to us, but that we should refer\r\nthe whole, as they had proposed, to the negotiators at Madrid. This would\r\nsecure to us a continuation of the suspension of Indian hostilities, which\r\nthe Governor of New Orleans said he had brought about till the result\r\nof the negotiation at Madrid should be known; would not commit us as to\r\nrunning or not running the line, or imply any admission of doubt about\r\nour territorial right; and would avoid a rupture with Spain, which was\r\nmuch to be desired, while we had similar points to discuss with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nHamilton declared himself the advocate for peace. War would derange\r\nour affairs greatly; throw us back many years in the march towards\r\nprosperity; be difficult for us to pursue, our countrymen not being\r\ndisposed to become soldiers; a part of the Union feeling no interest in\r\nthe war, would with difficulty be brought to exert itself; and we had\r\nno navy. Ho was for everything which would procrastinate the event. A\r\nyear, even, was a great gain to a nation strengthening as we were. It\r\nlaid open to us, too, the chapter of accidents, which, in the present\r\nstate of Europe, was a very pregnant one. That while, however, he was\r\nfor delaying the event of war, he had no doubt it was to take place\r\nbetween us for the object in question; that jealousy and perseverance\r\nwere remarkable features in the character of the Spanish government,\r\nwith respect to their American possessions; that so far from receding\r\nas to their claims against us, they had been strengthening themselves\r\nin them. He had no doubt the present communication was by authority\r\nfrom the court. Under this impression, he thought we should be looking\r\nforward to the day of rupture, and preparing for it. That if we were\r\nunequal to the contest ourselves, it behoved us to provide allies for\r\nour aid. That in this view, but two nations could be named, France and\r\nEngland. France was too intimately connected with Spain in other points,\r\nand of too great mutual value, ever to separate for us. Her affairs too,\r\nwere such, that whatever issue they had, she could not be in a situation\r\nto make a respectable mediation for us. England alone, then, remained.\r\nIt would not be easy to affect it with her; however, he was for trying\r\nit, and for sounding them on the proposition of a defensive treaty of\r\nalliance. The inducements to such a treaty, on their part, might be,\r\n1. The desire of breaking up our former connections, which we knew they\r\nhad long wished. 2. A continuance of the _statu quo_ in commerce for ten\r\nyears, which he believed would be desirable to them. 3. An admission to\r\nsome navigable part of the Mississippi, by some line drawn from the Lake\r\nof the Woods to such navigable part. He had not, he said, examined the\r\nmap to see how such a line might be run, so as not to make too great a\r\nsacrifice. The navigation of the Mississippi being a joint possession,\r\nwe might then take measures in concert for the joint security of it. He\r\nwas, therefore, for immediately sounding them on this subject through\r\nour ministers at London; yet so as to keep ourselves unengaged as long\r\nas possible, in hopes a favorable issue with Spain might be otherwise\r\neffected. But he was for sounding immediately, and for not letting slip\r\nan opportunity of securing our object.\r\n\r\nE. Randolph concurred, in general, with me. He objected that such an\r\nalliance could not be effected without pecuniary consideration probably,\r\nwhich we could not give. And what was to be their aid? If men, our\r\ncitizens would see their armies get foothold in the United States, with\r\ngreat jealousy; it would be difficult to protect them. Even the French,\r\nduring the distress of the late war, excited some jealous sentiments.\r\n\r\nHamilton said, money was often, but not always demanded, and the aid he\r\nshould propose to stipulate would be in ships. Knox _non dissentiente_.\r\n\r\nThe President said the remedy would be worse than the disease, and stated\r\nsome of the disagreeable circumstances which would attend our making\r\nsuch overtures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember, 1792. Hamilton called on me to speak about our furnishing\r\nsupplies to the French colony of St. Domingo. He expressed his opinion,\r\nthat we ought to be cautious, and not go too far in our application\r\nof money to their use, lest it should not be recognized by the mother\r\ncountry. He did not even think that some kinds of government they might\r\nestablish could give a sufficient sanction.[9] I observed, that the\r\nNational Convention was now met, and would certainly establish a form\r\nof government; that as we had recognized the former government because\r\nestablished by authority of the _nation_, so we must recognize any other\r\nwhich should be established by the authority of the nation. He said we\r\nhad recognized the former, because it contained an important member of\r\nthe ancient, to wit: the King, and wore the appearance of his consent;\r\nbut if, in any future form, they should omit the King, he did not know\r\nthat we could with safety recognize it, or pay money to its order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 19th, 1792. Beckley brings me the pamphlet written by\r\nHamilton, before the war, in answer to Common Sense. It is entitled\r\n\"Plain Truth.\" Melancthon Smith sends it to Beckley, and in his letter\r\nsays, it was not printed in New York by Loudon, because prevented by a\r\nmob, and was printed in Philadelphia, and that he has these facts from\r\nLoudon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 21st, 1792. Mr. Butler tells me, that he dined last winter\r\nwith Mr. Campbell from Denmark, in company with Hamilton, Lawrence, Dr.\r\nShippen, T. Shippen, and one other person whom he cannot recollect. That\r\nafter dinner political principles became the subject of conversation;\r\nthat Hamilton declared openly, that \"there was no stability, no security\r\nin any kind of government but a monarchy.\" That Lawrence took him up,\r\nand entered the lists of argument against him; that the dispute continued\r\nlong, and grew warm, remarkably so as between them; that T. Shippen, at\r\nlength, joined Lawrence in it; and in fine, that it broke up the company.\r\nButler recommended to the company, that the dispute having probably gone\r\nfarther than was intended, it ought to be considered as confined to the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 10th, 1792. Present: Alexander Hamilton, General Knox,\r\nEdmund Randolph, and Th: Jefferson, at the President's.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to reject meeting the Indians at the proposed treaty, rather\r\nthan to admit a _mediation_ by Great Britain; but to admit the presence\r\nof Governor Simcoe, not as a _party_ (if that was insisted on); and that\r\nI should make a verbal communication to Mr. Hammond, in substance, as\r\non the back hereof, which I previously read to the President.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 12th. I made the communication to Mr. Hammond. He said the\r\nattendance of Governor Simcoe was a circumstance only mentioned by him,\r\nbut not desired; that he would decline it without difficulty; declared\r\nit to be their most ardent wish that peace should take place, for their\r\nfur-trade was entirely interrupted; and he urged as decisive proof of\r\nthe sincerity of their wish,--1st. That they had kept the late Indian\r\ncouncil together six weeks at a very great expense, waiting for the Six\r\nNations. 2d. That the Indians at that council were so perfectly satisfied\r\nof their desire that they should make peace, that they had not so much\r\nas mentioned in council the applying to the British for any supplies.\r\nI immediately communicated this to the President.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 13th, 1792. The President called on me to see the model\r\nand drawings of some mills for sawing stone. After showing them, he\r\nin the course of a subsequent conversation asked me if there were not\r\nsome good manufactories of porcelain in Germany; that he was in want\r\nof table china, and had been speaking to Mr. Shaw, who was going to the\r\nEast Indies to bring him a set, but he found that it would not come till\r\n_he should no longer be in a situation to want it_. He took occasion a\r\nsecond time to observe that Shaw said it would be two years at least,\r\nbefore he could have the china here, before which time he said he should\r\nbe where he should not need it. I think he asked the question about\r\nthe manufactories in Germany merely to have an indirect opportunity of\r\ntelling me he meant to retire, and within the limits of two years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 17th. Hammond says the person is here to whom the Six Nations\r\ndelivered the invitation for Simcoe to attend, who says they insisted on\r\nit, and would consider his non-attendance as an evidence that he does\r\nnot wish for peace; but he says that Simcoe has not the least idea of\r\nattending; that this gentleman says we may procure in Upper Canada any\r\nquantity of provisions, which the people will salt up express during\r\nwinter; and that he will return and carry our request whenever we are\r\nready.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThursday, December the 27th, 1792. I waited on the President on some\r\ncurrent business. After this was over, he observed to me, that he thought\r\nit was time to endeavor to effect a stricter connection with France,\r\nand that Gouverneur Morris should be written to on this subject. He\r\nwent into the circumstances of dissatisfaction between Spain and Great\r\nBritain, and us, and observed, there was no nation on whom we could rely,\r\nat all times, but France; and that, if we did not prepare in time some\r\nsupport, in the event of rupture with Spain and England, we might be\r\ncharged with a criminal negligence. [I was much pleased with the tone\r\nof these observations. It was the very doctrine which had been my polar\r\nstar, and I did not need the successes of the republican arms in France,\r\nlately announced to us, to bring me to these sentiments. For it is to be\r\nnoted, that on Saturday last (the 22d) I received Mr. Short's letters of\r\nOctober the 9th and 12th, with the Leyden gazettes to October the 13th,\r\ngiving us the first news of the retreat of the Duke of Brunswick, and the\r\ncapture of Spires and Worms by Custine, and that of Nice by Anselme.]\r\nI therefore expressed to the President my cordial approbation of these\r\nideas; told him I had meant on that day (as an opportunity of writing\r\nby the British packet would occur immediately) to take his orders for\r\nremoving the suspension of payments to France, which had been imposed by\r\nmy last letter to Gouverneur Morris, but was meant, as I supposed, only\r\nfor the interval between the abolition of the late constitution by the\r\ndethronement of the King, and the meeting of some other body, invested\r\nby the will of the nation with powers to transact their affairs; that\r\nI considered the National Convention, then assembled, as such a body;\r\nand that, therefore, we ought to go on with the payments to them, or\r\nto any government they should establish; that, however, I had learned\r\nlast night, that some clause in the bill for providing reimbursement\r\nof the loan made by the bank to the United States, had given rise to\r\na question before the House of Representatives yesterday, which might\r\naffect these payments; a clause in that bill proposing, that the money\r\nformerly borrowed in Amsterdam, to pay the French debt, and appropriated\r\nby law (1690, August 4th, c. 34, s. 2) to that purpose, lying dead as\r\nwas suggested, should be taken to pay the bank, and the President be\r\nauthorized to borrow two millions of dollars more, out of which it should\r\nbe replaced; and if this should be done, the removal of our suspension\r\nof payments, as I had been about to propose, would be premature. He\r\nexpressed his disapprobation of the clause above mentioned; thought it\r\nhighly improper in the Legislature to change an appropriation once made,\r\nand added, that no one could tell in what that would end. I concurred,\r\nbut observed, that on a division of the House, the ayes for striking out\r\nthe clause were twenty-seven, the noes twenty-six; whereon the Speaker\r\ngave his vote against striking out, which divides the House: the clause\r\nfor the disappropriation remained of course. I mentioned suspicions, that\r\nthe whole of this was a trick to serve the bank under a great existing\r\nembarrassment; that the debt to the bank was to be repaid by instalments;\r\nthat the first instalment was of two hundred thousand dollars only, or\r\nrather one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, (because forty thousand\r\nof the two hundred thousand dollars would be the United States' own\r\ndividend of the instalment.) Yet here were two millions to be paid them\r\nat once, and to be taken from a purpose of gratitude and honor, to which\r\nit had been appropriated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 30th, 1792. I took the occasion furnished by Pinckney's\r\nletter of September the 19th, asking instructions how to conduct himself\r\nas to the French revolution, to lay down the catholic principal of\r\nrepublicanism, to wit, that every people may establish what form of\r\ngovernment they please, and change it as they please; the will of the\r\nnation being the only thing essential. I was induced to do this, in order\r\nto extract the President's opinion on the question which divided Hamilton\r\nand myself in the conversation of November, 1792, and the previous one\r\nof the first week of November, on the suspension of payments to France;\r\nand if favorable to mine, to place the principles of record in the\r\nletter books of my office. I therefore wrote the letter of December the\r\n30th, to Pinckney, and sent it to the President, and he returned me his\r\napprobation in writing, in his note of the same date, which see.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 7th, 1793. I waited on the President with letters and\r\npapers from Lisbon. After going through these, I told him that I had\r\nfor some time suspended speaking with him on the subject of my going out\r\nof office, because I had understood that the bill for intercourse with\r\nforeign nations was likely to be rejected by the Senate, in which case,\r\nthe remaining business of the department would be too inconsiderable to\r\nmake it worth while to keep it up. But that the bill being now passed,\r\nI was freed from the considerations of propriety which had embarrassed\r\nme. That &c. [nearly in the words of a letter to Mr. T. M. Randolph,\r\nof a few days ago,] and that I should be willing, if he had taken no\r\narrangements to the contrary, to continue somewhat longer, how long I\r\ncould not say, perhaps till summer, perhaps autumn. He said, so far from\r\ntaking arrangements on the subject, he had never mentioned to any mortal\r\nthe design of retiring which I had expressed to him, till yesterday,\r\nwhen having heard that I had given up my house, and that it was rented by\r\nanother, he thereupon mentioned it to Mr. E. Randolph, and asked him, as\r\nhe knew my retirement had been talked of, whether he had heard any persons\r\nsuggested in conversation to succeed me. He expressed his satisfaction\r\nat my change of purpose, and his apprehensions that my retirement would\r\nbe a new source of uneasiness to the public. He said Governor Lee had\r\nthat day informed him of the general discontent prevailing in Virginia,\r\nof which he never had had any conception, much less sound information.\r\nThat it appeared to him very alarming. He proceeded to express his\r\nearnest wish that Hamilton and myself could coalesce in the measures\r\nof the government, and urged here the general reasons for it which he\r\nhad done to me in two former conversations. He said he had proposed the\r\nsame thing to Hamilton, who expressed his readiness, and he thought\r\nour coalition would secure the general acquiescence of the public. I\r\ntold him my concurrence was of much less importance than he seemed to\r\nimagine; that I kept myself aloof from all cabal and correspondence\r\non the subject of the government, and saw and spoke with as few as I\r\ncould. That as to a coalition with Mr. Hamilton, if by that was meant\r\nthat either was to sacrifice his general system to the other, it was\r\nimpossible. We had both, no doubt, formed our conclusions after the\r\nmost mature consideration; and principles conscientiously adopted,\r\ncould not be given up on either side. My wish was, to see both Houses\r\nof Congress cleansed of all persons interested in the bank or public\r\nstocks; and that a pure legislature being given us, I should always be\r\nready to acquiesce under their determinations, even if contrary to my\r\nown opinions; for that I subscribe to the principle, that the will of\r\nthe majority, honestly expressed, should give law. I confirmed him in\r\nthe fact of the great discontents to the south; that they were grounded\r\non seeing that their judgments and interests were sacrificed to those\r\nof the eastern States on every occasion, and their belief that it was\r\nthe effect of a corrupt squadron of voters in Congress, at the command\r\nof the Treasury; and they see that if the votes of those members who\r\nhad any interest distinct from, and contrary to the general interest of\r\ntheir constituents, had been withdrawn, as in decency and honesty they\r\nshould have been, the laws would have been the reverse of what they are\r\non all the great questions. I instanced the new Assumption carried in\r\nthe House of Representatives by the Speaker's vote. On this subject he\r\nmade no reply. He explained his remaining in office to have been the\r\neffect of strong solicitations after he returned here; declaring that\r\nhe had never mentioned his purpose of going out but to the Heads of\r\ndepartments and Mr. Madison; he expressed the extreme wretchedness of\r\nhis existence while in office, and went lengthily into the late attacks\r\non him for levees &c., and explained to me how he had been led into them\r\nby the persons he consulted at New York; and that if he could but know\r\nwhat the sense of the public was, he would most cheerfully conform to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 16th, 1793. E. Randolph tells J. Madison and myself, a\r\ncurious fact which he had from Lear. When the President went to New\r\nYork, he resisted for three weeks the efforts to introduce levees. At\r\nlength he yielded, and left it to Humphreys and some others to settle\r\nthe forms. Accordingly, an ante-chamber and presence room were provided,\r\nand when those who were to pay their court were assembled, the President\r\nset out, preceded by Humphreys. After passing through the anti-chamber,\r\nthe door of the inner room was thrown open, and Humphreys entered first,\r\ncalling out with a loud voice, \"the President of the United States.\" The\r\nPresident was so much disconcerted with it, that he did not recover from\r\nit the whole time of the levee, and when the company was gone, he said\r\nto Humphreys, \"Well, you have taken me in once, but by God you shall\r\nnever take me in a second time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the rejection of the late additional\r\nAssumption by the Senate, was effected by the President through Lear,\r\noperating on Langdon. Beckley knows this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 20th, 1793. Colonel W. S. Smith called on me to communicate\r\nintelligence from France. He had left Paris November the 9th. He says the\r\nFrench ministers are entirely broken with Gouverneur Morris; shut their\r\ndoors to him, and will never receive another communication from him. They\r\nwished Smith to be the bearer of a message from the President, to this\r\neffect, but he declined; and they said in that case they would press it\r\nthrough their own minister here. He says they are sending Genet here\r\nwith full powers to give us all the privileges we can desire in their\r\ncountries, and particularly in the West Indies; that they even contemplate\r\nto set them free the next summer; that they propose to emancipate South\r\nAmerica, and will send forty-five ships of the line there next spring,\r\nand Miranda at the head of the expedition; that they desire our debt to\r\nbe paid them in provisions, and have authorized him to negotiate this.\r\nIn confirmation of this, he delivers a letter to the President from Le\r\nBrun, minister for foreign affairs, in which Le Brun says that Colonel\r\nSmith will communicate plans worthy of his (the President's) great mind,\r\nand he shall be happy to receive his opinion as to the means the most\r\nsuitable to effect it.\r\n\r\nI had, five or six days ago, received from Ternant, extracts from the\r\nlives of his ministers, complaining of both Gouverneur Morris and Mr.\r\nShort. I sent them this day to the President with an extract from a\r\nprivate letter of Mr. Short, justifying himself, and I called this evening\r\non the President. He said he considered the extracts from Ternant very\r\nserious--in short, as decisive; that he saw that Gouverneur Morris could\r\nbe no longer continued there consistent with the public good; that the\r\nmoment was critical in our favor, and ought not to be lost; that he\r\nwas extremely at a loss what arrangement to make. I asked him whether\r\nGouverneur Morris and Pinckney might not change places. He said that\r\nwould be a sort of remedy, but not a radical one. That if the French\r\nministry conceived Gouverneur Morris to be hostile to them; if they\r\nwould be jealous merely on his proposing to visit London, they would\r\nnever be satisfied with us at placing him at London permanently. He then\r\nobserved, that though I had unfixed the day on which I had intended to\r\nresign, yet I appeared fixed in doing it at no great distance of time;\r\nthat in this case, he could not but wish that I would go to Paris; that\r\nthe moment was important: I possessed the confidence of both sides, and\r\nmight do great good; that he wished I could do it, were it only to stay\r\nthere a year or two. I told him that my mind was so bent on retirement\r\nthat I could not think of launching forth again in a new business; that\r\nI could never again cross the Atlantic; and that as to the opportunity\r\nof doing good, this was likely to be the scene of action, as Genet was\r\nbringing powers to do the business here; but that I could not think of\r\ngoing abroad. He replied that I had pressed him to continue in the public\r\nservice, and refused to do the same myself. I said the case was very\r\ndifferent; he united the confidence of all America, and was the only\r\nperson who did so: his services therefore were of the last importance;\r\nbut for myself, my going out would not be noted or known. A thousand\r\nothers could supply my place to equal advantage, therefore I felt myself\r\nfree; and that as to the mission to France, I thought perfectly proper.\r\nHe desired me then to consider maturely what arrangement should be made.\r\n\r\nSmith, in speaking of Morris, said, that at his own table, in presence\r\nof his company and servants, he cursed the French ministers, as a set of\r\ndamned rascals; said the king would still be replaced upon his throne.\r\nHe said he knew they had written to have him recalled, and expected to be\r\nrecalled. He consulted Smith to know whether he would bring his furniture\r\nhere duty free. Smith has mentioned the situation of Gouverneur Morris\r\nfreely to others here. Smith said also that the ministers told him they\r\nmeant to begin their attack at the mouth of the Mississippi, and to\r\nsweep along the Bay of Mexico southwardly, and that they would have no\r\nobjection to our incorporating into our government the two Floridas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 25th, 1793. The President desires the opinions of the heads\r\nof the three departments, and of the Attorney-General, on the following\r\nquestion, to wit: Mr. Ternant having applied for money equivalent to three\r\nmillions of livres, to be furnished on account of our debt to France at\r\nthe request of the executive of that country, which sum is to be laid\r\nout in provisions within the United States, to be sent to France. Shall\r\nthe money be furnished?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury stated it as his opinion, that making\r\na liberal allowance for the depreciation of assignats, (no rule of\r\nliquidation having been yet fixed,) a sum of about three hundred and\r\neighteen thousand dollars may not exceed the arrearages equitably due\r\nto France to the end of 1792, and that the whole sum asked for may be\r\nfurnished within periods capable of answering the purpose of Mr. Ternant's\r\napplication, without a derangement of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Secretaries of State and War, and the Attorney General,\r\nare of opinion that the whole sum asked for by Mr. Ternant ought to be\r\nfurnished: the Secretary of the Treasury is of opinion that the supply\r\nought not exceed the above-mentioned sum of three hundred and eighteen\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe President having required the attendance of the heads of the three\r\ndepartments, and of the Attorney General, at his house, on Monday the\r\n25th of February, 1793, the following questions were proposed, and\r\nanswers given:\r\n\r\n1. The Governor of Canada having refused to let us obtain provisions\r\nfrom that province, or to pass them along the water communication to the\r\nplace of treaty with the Indians; and the Indians having refused to let\r\nthem pass peaceably along what they call the bloody path, the Governor\r\nof Canada at the same time proposing to furnish the whole provisions\r\nnecessary, ought the treaty to proceed? Answer unanimously, it ought to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n2. Have the Executive, or the Executive and Senate together, authority\r\nto relinquish to the Indians the right of soil of any part of the land\r\nnorth of the Ohio, which has been validly obtained by former treaties?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary at War, and Attorney\r\nGeneral, are of opinion that the Executive and Senate have such authority,\r\nprovided that no grants to individuals, nor reservations to States, be\r\nthereby infringed. The Secretary of State is of opinion they have no\r\nsuch authority to relinquish.\r\n\r\n3. Will it be expedient to make any such relinquishments to the Indians,\r\nif essential to peace?\r\n\r\nThe Secretaries of the Treasury and War, and the Attorney General, are of\r\nopinion it will be expedient to make such relinquishments if essential to\r\npeace, provided it do not include any lands sold or received for special\r\npurposes (the reservations for trading places excepted). The Secretary\r\nof State is of opinion that the Executive and Senate have authority to\r\nstipulate with the Indians, and that if essential to peace, it will be\r\nexpedient to stipulate that we will not settle any lands between those\r\nalready sold, or reserved for special purposes, and the lines heretofore\r\nvalidly established with the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhether the Senate shall be previously consulted on this point. The\r\nopinion unanimously is, that it will be better not to consult them\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 26th, 1793. Notes on the proceedings of yesterday. [See\r\nthe formal opinions given to the President in writing, and signed.]\r\n\r\nFirst question. We are all of opinion that the treaty should proceed\r\nmerely to gratify the public opinion, and not from an expectation of\r\nsuccess. I expressed myself strongly, that the event was so unpromising,\r\nthat I thought the preparations for a campaign should go on without the\r\nleast relaxation, and that a day should be fixed with the commissioners\r\nfor the treaty, beyond which they should not permit the treaty to be\r\nprotracted, by which day orders should be given for our forces to enter\r\ninto action. The President took up the thing instantly, after I had said\r\nthis, and declared that he was so much in the opinion that the treaty\r\nwould end in nothing, that he then, in the presence of us all, gave\r\norders to General Knox, not to slacken the preparations for the campaign\r\nin the least, but to exert every nerve in preparing for it. Knox said\r\nsomething about the ultimate day for continuing the negotiations. I\r\nacknowledged myself not a judge on what day the campaign should begin,\r\nbut that whatever it was, that day should terminate the treaty. Knox said\r\nhe thought a winter campaign was always the most efficacious against the\r\nIndians. I was of opinion, since Great Britain insisted on furnishing\r\nprovisions, that we should offer to repay. Hamilton thought we should not.\r\n\r\nSecond question. I considered our right of pre-emption of the Indian\r\nlands, not as amounting to any dominion, or jurisdiction, or paramountship\r\nwhatever, but merely in the nature of a remainder after the extinguishment\r\nof a present right, which gave us no present right whatever, but of\r\npreventing other nations from taking possession, and so defeating our\r\nexpectancy; that the Indians had the full, undivided and independent\r\nsovereignty as long as they choose to keep it, and that this might be\r\nforever; that as fast as we extend our rights by purchase from them, so\r\nfast we extend the limits of our society, and as soon as a new portion\r\nbecame encircled within our line, it became a fixed limit of our society;\r\nthat the executive, with either or both branches of the legislature,\r\ncould not alien any part of our territory; that by the law of nations\r\nit was settled, that the unity and indivisibility of the society was\r\nso fundamental, that it could not be dismembered by the constituted\r\nauthorities, except, 1, where _all power_ was delegated to them (as\r\nin the case of despotic governments), or, 2, where it was expressly\r\ndelegated; that neither of these delegations had been made to our General\r\nGovernment, and therefore, that it had no right to dismember or alienate\r\nany portion of territory once ultimately consolidated with us; and that\r\nwe could no more cede to the Indians than to the English or Spaniards,\r\nas it might, according to acknowledged principles, remain as irrevocably\r\nand eternally with the one as the other. But I thought, that as we had\r\na right to sell and settle lands once comprehended within our lines, so\r\nwe might forbear to exercise that right, retaining the property till\r\ncircumstances should be more favorable to the settlement, and this I\r\nagreed to do in the present instance, if necessary for peace.\r\n\r\nHamilton agreed to the doctrine of the law of nations, as laid down\r\nin Europe, but that it was founded on the universality of settlement\r\nthere; consequently, that no lopping off of territory could be made\r\nwithout a lopping off of citizens, which required their consent; but\r\nthat the law of nations for us must be adapted to the circumstance of\r\nour unsettled country, which he conceived the President and Senate may\r\ncede; that the power of treaty was given to them by the Constitution,\r\nwithout restraining it to particular objects; consequently, that it\r\nwas given in as plenipotentiary a form as held by any sovereign in any\r\nother society. Randolph was of opinion there was a difference between\r\na cession to Indians and to any others, because it only restored the\r\nceded part to the condition in which it was before we bought it, and\r\nconsequently, that we might buy it again hereafter; therefore, he thought\r\nthe executive and Senate could cede it. Knox joined in the main opinion.\r\nThe President discovered no opinion, but he made some efforts to get us\r\nto join in some terms which could unite us all, and he seemed to direct\r\nthose efforts more towards me; but the thing could not be done.\r\n\r\nThird question. We agreed in idea as to the line to be drawn, to wit,\r\nso as to retain all lands appropriated, or granted, or reserved.\r\n\r\nFourth question. We all thought if the Senate should be consulted, and\r\nconsequently apprized of our line, it would become known to Hammond,\r\nand we should lose all chance of saving anything more at the treaty than\r\nour ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe President, at this meeting, mentioned the declaration of some person,\r\nin a paper of Fenno, that he would commence an attack on the character\r\nof Dr. Franklin. He said the theme was to him excessively disagreeable on\r\nother considerations, but most particularly so, as the party seemed to do\r\nit as a means of defending him (the President) against the late attacks\r\non him; that such a mode of defence would be peculiarly painful to him,\r\nand he wished it could be stopped. Hamilton and Randolph undertook to\r\nspeak to Fenno to suppress it, without mentioning it as the President's\r\nwish. Both observed that they had heard this declaration mentioned in\r\nmany companies, and that it had excited universal horror and detestation.\r\n\r\nThe paper in Fenno must lie between two persons, viz., Adams and Izard,\r\nbecause they are the only persons who could know such facts as are there\r\npromised to be unfolded. Adams is an enemy to both characters, and might\r\nchoose this ground as an effectual position to injure both. Izard hated\r\nFranklin with unparalleled bitterness, but humbly adores the President,\r\nbecause he is in _loco regis_. If the paper proceeds, we shall easily\r\ndiscover which of these two gentlemen is the champion. In the meantime,\r\nthe first paper leads our suspicions more towards Izard than Adams, from\r\nthe circumstance of style, and because he is quite booby enough not to\r\nsee the injury he would do to the President by such a mode of defence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 28th. Knox, E. Randolph and myself met at Knox's, where\r\nHamilton was also to have met, to consider the time, manner and place of\r\nthe President's swearing in. Hamilton had been there before, and had left\r\nhis opinion with Knox, to wit, that the President should ask a judge to\r\nattend him in his own house to administer the oath, in the presence of\r\nthe Heads of departments, which oath should be deposited in the Secretary\r\nof State's office. I concurred in this opinion. Randolph was for the\r\nPresident's going to the Senate's chamber to take the oath, attended by\r\nthe marshal of the United States, who should then make proclamation, &c.\r\nKnox was for this, and for adding the House of Representatives to the\r\npresence, as they would not yet be departed. Our individual opinions were\r\nwritten, to be communicated to the President, out of which he might form\r\none. In the course of our conversation, Knox, stickling for parade, got\r\ninto great warmth, and swore that our government must either be entirely\r\nnew modeled, or it would be knocked to pieces in less than ten years;\r\nand that as it is at present, he would not give a copper for it; that\r\nit is the President's character, and not the written constitution, which\r\nkeeps it together.\r\n\r\nSame day. Conversation with Lear. He expressed the strongest confidence\r\nthat republicanism was the universal creed of America, except of a very\r\nfew; that a republican administration must of necessity immediately\r\noverbear the contrary faction; said that he had seen with extreme regret\r\nthat a number of gentlemen had for a long time been endeavoring to instil\r\ninto the President, that the noise against the administration of the\r\ngovernment was that of a little faction, which would soon be silent, and\r\nwhich was detested by the people, who were contented and prosperous;\r\nthat this very party, however, began to see their error, and that the\r\nsense of America was bursting forth to their conviction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 2d, 1793. See in the papers of this date, Mr. Giles's\r\nresolutions. He and one or two others were sanguine enough to believe\r\nthat the palpableness of these resolutions rendered it impossible the\r\nHouse could reject them. Those who knew the composition of the House, 1,\r\nof bank directors; 2 holders of bank stock; 3, stock jobbers; 4, blind\r\ndevotees; 5, ignorant persons who did not comprehend them; 6, lazy and\r\ngood-humored persons, who comprehended and acknowledged them, yet were\r\ntoo lazy to examine, or unwilling to pronounce censure; the persons who\r\nknew these characters, foresaw that the three first descriptions making\r\none-third of the House, the three latter would make one-half of the\r\nresidue; and, of course, that they would be rejected by a majority of\r\ntwo to one. But they thought that even this rejection would do good, by\r\nshowing the public the desperate and abandoned dispositions with which\r\ntheir affairs were conducted. The resolutions were proposed, and nothing\r\nspared to present them in the fulness of demonstration. There were not\r\nmore than three or four who voted otherwise than had been expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 30th, 1793. At our meeting at the President's, February the\r\n25th, in discussing the question, whether we should furnish to France the\r\nthree millions of livres desired, Hamilton, in speaking on the subject,\r\nused this expression, \"When Mr. Genet arrives, whether we shall receive\r\nhim or not, will then be a question for discussion,\" which expression I\r\ndid not recollect till E. Randolph reminded me of it a few days after.\r\nTherefore, on the 20th instant, as the President was shortly to set out\r\nfor Mount Vernon, I observed to him, that as Genet might arrive in his\r\nabsence, I wished to know beforehand how I should treat him, whether\r\nas a person who would or would not be received? He said he could see no\r\nground of doubt but that he ought to be received. On the 24th he asked\r\nE. Randolph's opinion on the subject, saying he had consulted Colonel\r\nHamilton thereon, who went into lengthy considerations of doubt and\r\ndifficulty, and viewing it as a very unfortunate thing that the President\r\nshould have the decision of so critical a point forced on him; but, in\r\nconclusion, said, since he was brought into that situation, he did not\r\nsee but that he must receive Mr. Genet. Randolph told the President he\r\nwas clear he should be received, and the President said he had never\r\nhad any doubt on the subject in his mind. Afterwards, on the same day,\r\nhe spoke to me again on it, and said Mr. Genet should unquestionably be\r\nreceived; but he thought not with too much warmth or cordiality, so only\r\nas to be satisfactory to him. I wondered at first at this restriction;\r\nbut when Randolph afterwards communicated to me his conversation of\r\nthe 24th, I became satisfied it was a small sacrifice to the opinion of\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 31st. Mr. Beckley tells me, that the merchants' bonds for\r\nduties on six months' credit became due the 1st instant to a very great\r\namount, that Hamilton went to the bank on that day, and directed the bank\r\nto discount for those merchants all their bonds at thirty days, and that\r\nhe would have the collectors credited for the money at the treasury.\r\nHence, the treasury lumping its receipts by the month in its printed\r\naccounts, these sums will be considered by the public as only received\r\non the last day; consequently, the bank makes the month's interest out\r\nof it. Beckley had this from a merchant who had a bond discounted, and\r\nsupposes a million of dollars were discounted at the bank here. Mr.\r\nBrown got the same information from another merchant, who supposed only\r\nsix hundred thousand dollars discounted here. But they suppose the same\r\norders went to all the branch banks to a great amount.\r\n\r\n_Eodem die._ Mr. Brown tells me he has it from a merchant, that during\r\nthe last winter the directors of the bank ordered the freest discounts.\r\nEvery man could obtain it. Money being so flush, the six per cents run\r\nup to twenty-one and twenty-two shillings. Then the directors sold out\r\ntheir private stocks. When the discounted notes were becoming due, they\r\nstopped discounts, and not a dollar was to be had. This reduced six per\r\ncents to eighteen shillings and three pence; then the same directors\r\nbought in again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 7th, 1793. Mr. Lear called on me, and introduced of himself\r\na conversation on the affairs of the United States. He laughed at the\r\ncry of prosperity, and the deriving it from the establishment of the\r\ntreasury: he said, that so far from giving into this opinion, and that\r\nwe were paying off our national debt, he was clear the debt was growing\r\non us; that he had lately expressed this opinion to the President, who\r\nappeared much astonished at it. I told him I had given the same hint\r\nto the President last summer, and lately again had suggested, that we\r\nwere even depending for the daily subsistence of government on borrowed\r\nmoney. He said, that was certain, and was the only way of accounting for\r\nwhat was become of the money drawn over from Holland to this country.\r\nHe regretted that the President was not in the way of hearing full\r\ninformation, declared he communicated to him everything he could learn\r\nhimself; that the men who vaunted the present government so much on\r\nsome occasions, were the very men who at other times declared it was a\r\npoor thing, and such a one as could not stand, and he was sensible they\r\nonly esteemed it as a stepping stone to something else, and had availed\r\nthemselves of the first moments of the enthusiasm in favor of it, to\r\npervert its principles and make of it what they wanted; and that though\r\nthey raised the cry of anti-federalism against those who censured the\r\nmode of administration, yet he was satisfied, whenever it should come to\r\nbe tried, that the very men whom they called anti-federalists, were the\r\nmen who would save the government, and he looked to the next Congress\r\nfor much rectification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 18th. The President sends a set of questions to be considered,\r\nand calls a meeting. Though those sent me were in his own hand writing,\r\nyet it was palpable from the style, their ingenious tissue and suite,\r\nthat they were not the President's, that they were raised upon a prepared\r\nchain of argument, in short, that the language was Hamilton's, and the\r\ndoubts his alone. They led to a declaration of the executive, that our\r\ntreaty with France is void. E. Randolph, the next day, told me that the\r\nday before the date of these questions, Hamilton went with him through\r\nthe whole chain of reasoning of which these questions are the skeleton,\r\nand that he recognized them the moment he saw them.\r\n\r\nWe met. The first question, whether we should receive the French\r\nminister, Genet, was proposed, and we agreed unanimously that he should\r\nbe received; Hamilton, at the same time, expressing his great regret\r\nthat any incident had happened, which should oblige us to recognize\r\nthe government. The next question was, whether he should be received\r\nabsolutely, or with qualifications. Here Hamilton took up the whole\r\nsubject, and went through it in the order in which the questions sketch\r\nit. See the chain of his reasoning in my opinions of April the 28th.\r\nKnox subscribed at once to Hamilton's opinion that we ought to declare\r\nthe treaty void, acknowledging, at the same time, like a fool as he is,\r\nthat he knew nothing about it. I was clear it remained valid. Randolph\r\ndeclared himself of the same opinion, but on Hamilton's undertaking to\r\npresent to him the authority in Vattel (which we had not present) and\r\nto prove to him, that if the authority was admitted, the treaty might be\r\ndeclared void, Randolph agreed to take further time to consider. It was\r\nadjourned. We determined, unanimously, the last question, that Congress\r\nshould not be called. There having been an intimation by Randolph, that\r\nin so great a question he should choose to give a written opinion, and\r\nthis being approved by the President, I gave in mine April the 28th.\r\nHamilton gave in his. I believe Knox's was never thought worth offering\r\nor asking for. Randolph gave his May the 6th, concurring with mine.\r\nThe President told me, the same day, he had never had a doubt about the\r\nvalidity of the treaty; but that since a question had been suggested,\r\nhe thought it ought to be considered; that this being done, I might\r\nnow issue passports to sea vessels in the form prescribed by the French\r\ntreaty. I had for a week past only issued the Dutch form; to have issued\r\nthe French, would have been presupposing the treaty to be in existence.\r\nThe President suggested, that he thought it would be as well that nothing\r\nshould be said of such a question having been under consideration.\r\n\r\nWritten May the 6th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay the 6th, 1793. When the question was, whether the proclamation of\r\nApril the 22d should be issued, Randolph observed, that there should\r\nbe a letter written by me to the ministers of the belligerent powers,\r\nto declare that it should not be taken as conclusive evidence against\r\nour citizens in foreign courts of admiralty, for contraband goods. Knox\r\nsuddenly adopted the opinion, before Hamilton delivered his. Hamilton\r\nopposed it pretty strongly. I thought it an indifferent thing, but\r\nrather approved Randolph's opinion. The President was against it; but\r\nobserved that _as there were three for it, it should go_. This was the\r\nfirst instance I had seen of an opportunity to decide by a mere majority,\r\nincluding his own vote.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay the 12th. Lear called on me to-day. Speaking of the lowness of stocks,\r\n(sixteen shillings,) I observed it was a pity we had not money to buy\r\non public account. He said, yes, and that it was the more provoking, as\r\ntwo millions had been borrowed for that purpose, and drawn over here,\r\nand yet were not here. That he had no doubt those would take notice of\r\nthe circumstance whose duty it was to do so. I suppose he must mean the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay the 23d. I had sent to the President yesterday, draughts of a letter\r\nfrom him to the Provisory Executive Council of France, and of one from\r\nmyself to Mr. Ternant, both on the occasion of his recall. I called on\r\nhim to-day. He said there was an expression in one of them, which he\r\nhad never before seen in any of our public communications, to wit, \"our\r\nrepublic.\" The letter prepared for him to the Council, began thus: \"The\r\nCitizen Ternant has delivered to me the letter wherein you inform me,\r\nthat yielding, &c., you had determined to recall him from his mission,\r\nas your Minister Plenipotentiary to _our republic_.\" He had underscored\r\nthe words, _our republic_. He said that certainly ours was a republican\r\ngovernment, but yet we had not used that style in this way; that if any\r\nbody wanted to change its form into a monarchy, he was sure it was only a\r\nfew individuals, and that no man in the United States would set his face\r\nagainst it more than himself; but that this was not what he was afraid\r\nof; his fears were from another quarter; that there was more danger of\r\nanarchy being introduced. He adverted to a piece in Freneau's paper of\r\nyesterday; he said he despised all their attacks on him personally,\r\nbut that there never had been an act of the government, not meaning\r\nin the executive line only, but in any line, which that paper had not\r\nabused. He had also marked the word republic thus [Illustration], where\r\nit was applied to the French republic. (See the original paper.) He was\r\nevidently sore and warm, and I took his intention to be, that I should\r\ninterpose in some way with Freneau, perhaps withdraw his appointment\r\nof translating clerk to my office. But I will not do it. His paper has\r\nsaved our constitution, which was galloping fast into monarchy, and has\r\nbeen checked by no one means so powerfully as by that paper. It is well\r\nand universally known, that it has been that paper which has checked the\r\ncareer of the monocrats; and the President, not sensible of the designs\r\nof the party, has not with his usual good sense and _sang froid_, looked\r\non the efforts and effects of this free press, and seen that, though\r\nsome bad things have passed through it to the public, yet the good have\r\npreponderated immensely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJune the 7th, 1793. Mr. Beckley, who has returned from New York within\r\na few days, tells me that while he was there, Sir John Temple, Consul\r\nGeneral of the northern States for Great Britain, showed him a letter\r\nfrom Sir Gregory Page Turner, a member of Parliament for a borough in\r\nYorkshire, who, he said, had been a member for twenty-five years, and\r\nalways confidential for the ministers, in which he permitted him to\r\nread particular passages of the following purport: \"that the government\r\nwas well apprized of the predominancy of the British interest in the\r\nUnited States; that they considered Colonel Hamilton, Mr. King, and Mr.\r\nW. Smith of South Carolina, as the main supports of that interest; that\r\nparticularly, they considered Colonel Hamilton, and not Mr. Hammond, as\r\ntheir effective minister here; that if the anti-federal interest (that\r\nwas his term), at the head of which they considered Mr. Jefferson to be,\r\nshould prevail, these gentlemen _had secured_ an asylum to themselves\r\nin England.\" Beckley could not understand whether they had secured it\r\n_themselves_,[10] or whether they were only notified that it was secured\r\nto them. So that they understand that they may go on boldly in their\r\nmachinations to change the government, and if they should be overset\r\nand choose to withdraw, they will be secure of a pension in England, as\r\nArnold, Deane, &c., had. Sir John read passages of a letter (which he did\r\nnot put into Beckley's hand, as he did the other) from Lord Grenville,\r\nsaying nearly the same things. This letter mentions to Sir John, that\r\nthough they had divided the Consul Generalship, and given the southern\r\ndepartment to Bond, yet he, Sir John, was to retain his whole salary.\r\n[By this it would seem, as if, wanting to use Bond, they had covered\r\nhis employment with this cloak.] Mr. Beckley says that Sir John Temple\r\nis a strong republican. I had a proof of his intimacy with Sir John in\r\nthis circumstance. Sir John received his new commission of Consul for\r\nthe northern department, and instead of sending it through Mr. Hammond,\r\ngot Beckley to enclose it to me for his exequatur. I wrote to Sir John\r\nthat it must come through Mr. Hammond, enclosing it back to him. He\r\naccordingly then sent it to Mr. Hammond.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with the President to-day, and speaking about General\r\nGreene, he said that he and General Greene had always differed in opinion\r\nabout the manner of using militia. Greene always placed them in his\r\nfront: himself was of opinion, they should always be used as a reserve to\r\nimprove any advantage, for which purpose they were the _finest fellows_\r\nin the world. He said he was on the ground of the battle of Guilford,\r\nwith a person who was in the action, and who explained the whole of it\r\nto him. That General Greene's front was behind a fence at the edge of\r\na large field, through which the enemy were obliged to pass to get at\r\nthem; and that in their passage through this, they must have been torn\r\nall to pieces, if troops had been posted there who would have stood their\r\nground; and that the retreat from that position was through a thicket,\r\nperfectly secure. Instead of this, he posted the North Carolina militia\r\nthere, who only gave one fire and fell back, so that the whole benefit\r\nof their position was lost. He thinks that the regulars, with their\r\nfield pieces, would have hardly let a single man get through that field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eodem die_ (June the 7th). Beckley tells me that he has the following\r\nfact from Governor Clinton. That before the proposition for the present\r\nGeneral Government, _i. e._ a little before Hamilton conceived a plan\r\nfor establishing a monarchial government in the United States, he wrote a\r\ndraught of a circular letter, which was to be sent to about ---- persons,\r\nto bring it about. One of these letters, in Hamilton's handwriting, is\r\nnow in possession of an old militia General up the North River, who,\r\nat that time, was thought _orthodox_ enough to be entrusted in the\r\nexecution. This General has given notice to Governor Clinton that he\r\nhas this paper, and that he will deliver it into his hands, and no one's\r\nelse. Clinton intends, the first interval of leisure, to go for it, and\r\nhe will bring it to Philadelphia. Beckley is a man of perfect truth as\r\nto what he affirms of his own knowledge, but too credulous as to what\r\nhe hears from others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJune the 10th, 1793. Mr. Brown gives me the following specimen of the\r\nphrenzy which prevailed at New York on the opening of the new government.\r\nThe first public ball which took place after the President's arrival\r\nthere, Colonel Humphreys, Colonel W. S. Smith and Mrs. Knox were to\r\narrange the ceremonials. These arrangements were as follows: a sofa at\r\nthe head of the room, raised on several steps, whereon the President\r\nand Mrs. Washington were to be seated. The gentlemen were to dance in\r\nswords. Each one, when going to dance, was to lead his partner to the\r\nfoot of the sofa, make a low obeisance to the President and his lady,\r\nthen go and dance, and when done, bring his partner again to the foot\r\nof the sofa for new obeisances, and then to retire to their chairs. It\r\nwas to be understood, too, that gentlemen should be dressed in bags.\r\nMrs. Knox contrived to come with the President, and to follow him and\r\nMrs. Washington to their destination, and she had the design of forcing\r\nan invitation from the President to a seat on the sofa. She mounted up\r\nthe steps after them unbidden, but unfortunately the wicked sofa was so\r\nshort, that when the President and Mrs. Washington were seated, there was\r\nnot room for a third person; she was obliged, therefore, to descend in\r\nthe face of the company, and to sit where she could. In other respects\r\nthe ceremony was conducted rigorously according to the arrangements,\r\nand the President made to pass an evening which his good sense rendered\r\na very miserable one to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJune the 12th. Beckley tells me that Klingham has been with him to day,\r\nand relates to him the following fact: A certificate of the old Congress\r\nhad been offered at the treasury and refused payment, and so indorsed\r\nin red ink as usual. This certificate came to the hands of Francis,\r\n(the quondam clerk of the treasury, who, on account of his being dipped\r\nin the infamous case of the Baron Glaubec, Hamilton had been obliged\r\nto dismiss, to save appearances, but with an assurance of all future\r\nservice, and he accordingly got him established in New York.) Francis\r\nwrote to Hamilton that such a ticket was offered him, but he could not\r\nbuy it unless he would inform him and give him his certificate that it\r\nwas good. Hamilton wrote him a most friendly letter, and sent him the\r\ncertificate. He bought the paper, and came on here and got it recognized,\r\nwhereby he made twenty-five hundred dollars. Klingham saw both the letter\r\nand certificate.\r\n\r\nIrving, a clerk in the treasury, an Irishman, is the author of the\r\npieces now coming out under the signature of Veritas, and attacking the\r\nPresident. I have long suspected this detestable game was playing by\r\nthe fiscal party, to place the President on their side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJune the 17th, 1793. At a meeting of the Heads of department at the\r\nPresident's this day, on summons from him, a letter from Mr. Genet of\r\nthe 15th inst. (addressed to the Secretary of State on the subject of\r\nthe seizure of a vessel by the Governor of New York, as having been\r\narmed, equipped and manned in that port, with a design to cruize on the\r\nenemies of France), was read, as also the draught of an answer prepared\r\nby the Secretary of State, which was approved.\r\n\r\nRead, also, a letter of June 14th from Mr. Hammond to the Secretary of\r\nState, desiring to know whether the French privateers, the Citizen Genet,\r\nand Sans Culottes, are to be allowed to return or send their prizes into\r\nthe ports of the United States. It is the opinion that he be informed that\r\nthey were required to depart to the dominions of their own sovereign, and\r\nnothing expressed as to their ulterior proceedings; and that in answer\r\nto that part which states that the Sans Culottes had increased its force\r\nin the port of Baltimore, and remained there in the avowed intention of\r\nwatching the motions of a valuable ship now lying there, it be answered\r\nthat we expect the speedy departure of those privateers will obviate\r\nthe inconveniences apprehended, and that it will be considered whether\r\nany practical arrangements can be adopted to prevent the augmentations\r\nof the force of armed vessels.\r\n\r\n                                                    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n                                                    ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n                                                    HENRY KNOX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJune the 20th, 1793. At a meeting this day of the Heads of department\r\nat the President's, on summons from him, a letter from Messrs. Viar and\r\nJaudenes, dated June 18th, and addressed to the Secretary of State, was\r\nread; whereupon it is the opinion that a full detail of the proceedings\r\nof the United States with respect to the southern Indians and the\r\nSpaniards be prepared, and a justification as to the particular matters\r\ncharged in the said letter; that this be sent, with all the necessary\r\ndocuments, to our commissioners at the court of Madrid, leaving to\r\nthem a discretion to change expressions in it which to them may appear\r\nlikely to give offence in the circumstances under which they may be at\r\nthe time of receiving it; and that a copy be sent to Mr. Pinckney for\r\nhis information, and to make such use of the matter it contains as to\r\nhim should seem expedient; that an answer be written to Messrs. Viar\r\nand Jaudenes informing them that we shall convey our sentiments on the\r\nsubject to their court through our commissioners at Madrid, and letting\r\nthem see that we are not insensible to the style and manner of their\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nA draught of a letter from the Secretary of State to Mr. Hammond, asking\r\nwhen an answer to his letter of May 29th, 1792, might be expected, was\r\nread and approved.\r\n\r\n                                                    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n                                                    ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n                                                    HENRY KNOX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly the 5th, 1793. A meeting desired by Alexander Hamilton at my office.\r\nHimself, Knox, and myself met accordingly. He said that according to what\r\nhad been agreed on in presence of the President, in consequence of Mr.\r\nGenet's declining to pay the $45,000 at his command in the treasury, to\r\nthe holders of the St. Domingo bills, we had agreed to pay the holders out\r\nof other moneys to that amount; that he found, however, that these bills\r\nwould amount to $90,000, and the question was whether he should assume\r\n$90,000 to be paid out of the September instalment. This, he said, would\r\nenable holders to get discounts at the banks, would therefore be equal\r\nto ready money, and save them from bankruptcy. Unanimously agreed to. We\r\nalso agreed to a letter written by General Knox to Governor Mifflin, to\r\nhave a particular inquiry made whether the Little Sarah is arming, &c.,\r\nor not. I read also Governor Lee's letter about the Governor of South\r\nCarolina's proclamation respecting pestilential disease in West Indies.\r\nWe are all of opinion the evidence is too slight for interference, and\r\ndoubt the power to interfere. Therefore let it lie.\r\n\r\nMr. Genet called on me, and read to me very rapidly instructions he\r\nhad prepared for Michaud, who is going to Kentucky; an address to the\r\ninhabitants of Louisiana, and another to those of Canada. In these papers\r\nit appears that, besides encouraging those inhabitants to insurrection,\r\nhe speaks of two generals in Kentucky who have proposed to him to go\r\nand take New Orleans, if he will furnish the expense, about £3,000\r\nsterling. He declines advancing it, but promises that sum ultimately\r\nfor their expenses; proposes that officers shall be commissioned by\r\nhimself in Kentucky and Louisiana; that they shall rendezvous _out of\r\nthe territories of the United States_,--suppose in Louisiana, and there\r\nmaking up a battalion to be called the ---- ---- of inhabitants of\r\nLouisiana and Kentucky, and getting what Indians they could, to undertake\r\nthe expedition against New Orleans, and then Louisiana to be established\r\ninto an independent State, connected in commerce with France and the\r\nUnited States; that two frigates shall go into the river Mississippi, and\r\nco-operate against New Orleans. The address to Canada was to encourage\r\nthem to shake off English yoke, to call Indians to their assistance,\r\nand to assure them of the friendly dispositions of their neighbors of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nHe said he communicated these things to me, not as Secretary of State,\r\nbut as Mr. Jefferson. I told him that his enticing officers and soldiers\r\nfrom Kentucky to go against Spain, was really putting a halter about\r\ntheir necks; for that they would assuredly be hung if they commenced\r\nhostilities against a nation at peace with the United States. That leaving\r\nout that article I did not care what insurrections should be excited\r\nin Louisiana. He had about a fortnight ago sent me a communication for\r\nMichaud as consul of France at Kentucky, and desired an Exequatur. I\r\ntold him this could not be given, that it was only in the _ports_ of the\r\nUnited States they were entitled to consuls, and that if France should\r\nhave a consul at Kentucky, England and Spain would soon demand the same,\r\nand we should have all our interior country filled with foreign agents.\r\nHe acquiesced, and asked me to return the commission and his note, which\r\nI did; but he desired I would give Michaud a letter of introduction for\r\nGovernor Shelby. I sent him one a day or two after. He now observes to\r\nme that in that letter I speak of him only as a person of botanical\r\nand natural pursuits, but that he wished the Governor to view him as\r\nsomething more; as a French citizen possessing his confidence. I took\r\nback the letter and wrote another.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum of a Meeting at the State House, Philadelphia relative to\r\nthe case of the Little Sarah._\r\n\r\nJuly the 8th, 1793. At a meeting at the State House of the City of\r\nPhiladelphia,\r\n\r\nPresent: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a brigantine, called the Little Sarah, has been fitted out\r\nat the port of Philadelphia, with fourteen cannon and all other equipment,\r\nindicating that she is intended to cruise under the authority of France,\r\nand that she is now lying in the river Delaware, at some place between\r\nthis city and Mud Island; that a conversation has been had between the\r\nSecretary of State and the Minister Plenipotentiary of France, in which\r\nconversation the Minister refused to give any explicit assurance that\r\nthe brigantine would continue until the arrival of the President, and\r\nhis decision in the case, but made declarations respecting her not being\r\nready to sail within the time of the expected return of the President,\r\nfrom which the Secretary of State infers with confidence, that she will\r\nnot sail till the President will have an opportunity of considering\r\nand determining the case; that in the course of the conversation, the\r\nMinister declared that the additional guns which had been taken in by\r\nthe Little Sarah were French property, but the Governor of Pennsylvania\r\ndeclared that he has good ground to believe that two of her cannon were\r\npurchased here of citizens of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania asks advice what steps, under the\r\ncircumstances, he shall pursue?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of War are of opinion,\r\nthat it is expedient that immediate measures should be taken provisionally\r\nfor establishing a battery on Mud Island, under cover of a party of\r\nmilitia, with direction that if the brig Sarah should attempt to depart\r\nbefore the pleasure of the President shall be known concerning her,\r\nmilitary coercion be employed to arrest and prevent her progress.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State dissents from this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reasons for his Dissent._\r\n\r\nI am against the preceding opinion of the Secretaries of the Treasury\r\nand War, for ordering a battery to be erected on Mud Island, and firing\r\non the Little Sarah, an armed vessel of the Republic of France:\r\n\r\nBecause I am satisfied, from what passed between Mr. Genet and myself at\r\nour personal interview yesterday, that the vessel will not be ordered to\r\nsail till the return of the President, which, by a letter of this day's\r\npost, we may certainly expect within eight and forty hours from this time.\r\n\r\nBecause the erecting a battery and mounting guns to prevent her passage\r\nmight cause a departure not now intended, and produce the fact it is\r\nmeant to prevent.\r\n\r\nBecause were such battery and guns now in readiness and to fire on her,\r\nin the present ardent state of her crew just in the moment of leaving\r\nport, it is morally certain that bloody consequences would follow. No one\r\ncould say how many lives would be lost on both sides, and all experience\r\nhas shown, that blood once seriously spilled between nation and nation,\r\nthe contest is continued by subordinate agents, and the door of peace is\r\nshut. At this moment, too, we expect in the river twenty of their ships\r\nof war, with a fleet of from one hundred to one hundred and fifty of\r\ntheir private vessels, which will arrive at the scene of blood in time\r\nto continue it, if not to partake in it.\r\n\r\nBecause the actual commencement of hostilities against a nation, for such\r\nthis act may be, is an act of too serious consequence to our countrymen\r\nto be brought on their heads by subordinate officers, not chosen by\r\nthem nor clothed with their confidence; and too presumptuous on the\r\npart of those officers, when the chief magistrate, into whose hands the\r\ncitizens have commited their safety, is within eight and forty hours of\r\nhis arrival here, and may have an opportunity of judging for himself and\r\nthem, whether the buying and carrying away two cannon, (for according\r\nto information, the rest are the nation's own property,) is sufficient\r\ncause of war between Americans and Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nBecause, should the vessel, contrary to expectation, depart before the\r\nPresident's arrival, the adverse powers may be told the truth of the case:\r\nthat she went off contrary to what we had a right to expect; that we shall\r\nbe justifiable in future cases to measure our confidence accordingly;\r\nthat for the present we shall demand satisfaction from France, which,\r\nwith the proof of good faith we have already given, ought to satisfy\r\nthem. Above all, Great Britain ought not to complain: for, since the date\r\nof the order forbidding that any of the belligerent powers should equip\r\nthemselves in our ports with our arms, these two cannon are all that\r\nhave escaped the vigilance of our officers on the part of their enemies,\r\nwhile their vessels have carried off more than ten times the number,\r\nwithout any impediment; and if the suggestion be true (and as yet it is\r\nbut suggestion) that there are fifteen or twenty Americans on board the\r\nLittle Sarah, who have gone with their own consent, it is equally true\r\nthat more than ten times that number of Americans are at this moment\r\non board English ships of war, who have been taken forcibly from our\r\nmerchant vessels at sea or in port, wherever met with, and compelled to\r\nbear arms against the friends of their country. And is it less a breach\r\nof our neutrality towards France to suffer England to strengthen herself\r\nwith our force, than towards England to suffer France to do so? And are\r\nwe equally ready and disposed to sink the British vessels in our ports\r\nby way of reprisal for this notorious and avowed practice?\r\n\r\nBecause it is inconsistent for a nation which has been patiently bearing\r\nfor ten years the grossest insults and injuries from their late enemies,\r\nto rise at a feather against their friends and benefactors; and that, too,\r\nin a moment when circumstances have kindled the most ardent affections\r\nof the two people towards each other; when the little subjects of\r\ndispleasure which have arisen are the acts of a particular individual,\r\nnot yet important enough to have been carried to his government as\r\ncauses of complaint; are such as nations of moderation and justice\r\nsettle by negociation, not making war their first step; are such as\r\nthat government would correct at a word, if we may judge from the late\r\nunequivocal demonstrations of their friendship towards us; and are very\r\nslight shades of the acts committed against us by England, which we have\r\nbeen endeavoring to rectify by negociation, and on which they have never\r\ncondescended to give any answer to our minister.\r\n\r\nBecause I would not gratify the combination of kings with the spectacle\r\nof the two only republics on earth destroying each other for two cannon;\r\nnor would I, for infinitely greater cause, add this country to that\r\ncombination, turn the scale of contest, and let it be from our hands\r\nthat the hopes of man received their last stab.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that a general order has been already given to\r\nstop by force vessels arming contrary to rule in our ports, in which I\r\nconcurred. I did so because it was highly presumeable that the destination\r\nof such a vessel would be discovered in some early stage, when there\r\nwould be few persons on board, these not yet disposed nor prepared to\r\nresist, and a small party of militia put aboard would stop the procedure\r\nwithout a marked infraction of the peace. But it is a much more serious\r\nthing when a vessel has her full complement of men, (here said to be one\r\nhundred and twenty,) with every preparation and probably with disposition\r\nto go through with their enterprise. A serious engagement is then a\r\ncertain consequence. Besides, an act of force, committed by an officer\r\nin a distant port, under general orders, given long ago, to take effect\r\non all cases, and with less latitude of discretion in him, would be\r\na much more negociable case than a recent order, given by the general\r\ngovernment itself (for that is the character we are to assume) on the\r\nspot, in the very moment, pointed at this special case, professing full\r\ndiscretion and not using it. This would be a stubborn transaction, not\r\nadmitting those justifications and explanations which might avert a war,\r\nor admitting such only as would be entirely humiliating to the officers\r\ngiving the order, and to the government itself.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, respect to the chief magistrate, respect to our countrymen,\r\ntheir lives, interests, and affection, respect to a most friendly nation,\r\nwho, if we give them the opportunity, will answer our wrongs by correcting\r\nand not by repeating them; respect to the most sacred cause that ever\r\nman was engaged in, poising maturely the evils which may flow from the\r\ncommitment of an act which it would be in the power and probably in the\r\ntemper of subordinate agents to make an act of continued war, and those\r\nwhich may flow from an eight and forty hours suspension of the act, are\r\nmotives with me for suspending it eight and forty hours, even should we\r\nthereby lose the opportunity of committing it altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of a minute given to the President._\r\n\r\nJuly the 12th, 1793. At a meeting of the Heads of the departments at\r\nthe President's, on summons from him, and on consideration of various\r\nrepresentations from the Minister Plenipotentiary of France and Great\r\nBritain, on the subject of vessels arming and arriving in our ports,\r\nand of prizes;--it is their opinion that letters be written to the\r\nsaid ministers, informing them that the executive of the United States\r\nis desirous of having done what shall be strictly conformable to the\r\ntreaties of the United States; and the laws respecting the said cases has\r\ndetermined to refer the questions arising therein to persons learned in\r\nthe laws; that as this reference will occasion some delay, it is expected\r\nthat, in the meantime, the Little Sarah, or Little Democrat, the ship\r\nJane, and the ship William, in the Delaware, the Citoyen Genet and her\r\nprizes, the brigs Lovely-Lass and Prince William Henry, and the brig in\r\nthe Chesapeake, do not depart till the further order of the President.\r\n\r\nThat letters be addressed to the judges of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, requesting their attendance at this place on Thursday the\r\n18th instant, to give their advice on certain matters of public concern,\r\nwhich will be referred to them by the President.\r\n\r\nThat the Governor be desired to have the ship Jane attended to with\r\nvigilance, and if she be found augmenting her force and about to depart,\r\nthat he cause her to be stopped.\r\n\r\n                                                    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n                                                    ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n                                                    HENRY KNOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A recapitulation of questions whereon we have given opinions._\r\n\r\nDoes the treaty with France leave us free to prohibit her from\r\narming vessels in our ports? Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton, Knox, and\r\nRandolph--unanimous--it does. As the treaty obliges us to prohibit the\r\nenemies of France from arming in our ports, and leaves us free to prohibit\r\nFrance, do not the laws of neutrality oblige us to prohibit her? Same\r\npersons answer they do.\r\n\r\nHow far may a prohibition now declared be retrospective to the vessels\r\narmed in Charleston before the prohibition, to wit, the Citoyen Genet\r\nand Sans Culottes, and what is to be done with these prizes? Thomas\r\nJefferson,--It cannot be retrospective at all; they may sell their\r\nprizes, and continue to act freely as other armed vessels of France.\r\nHamilton and Knox,--The prizes ought to be given up to the English,\r\nand the privateers suppressed. Randolph,--They are free to sell their\r\nprizes, and the privateers should be ordered away, not to return here\r\ntill they shall have been to the dominions of their own sovereign, and\r\nthereby purged the illegality of their origin. This last opinion was\r\nadopted by the President.\r\n\r\nOur citizens who have joined in these hostilities against nations at\r\npeace with the United States, are they punishable? E. Randolph gave an\r\nofficial opinion--they were. Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton and Knox joined\r\nin the opinion. All thought it our duty to have prosecutions instituted\r\nagainst them, that the laws might pronounce on their case. In the first\r\ninstance, two only were prosecuted merely to try the question, and to\r\nsatisfy the complaint of the British men; and because it was thought they\r\nmight have offended unwittingly. But a subsequent armament of a vessel\r\nat New York taking place with full knowledge of this prosecution, all\r\nthe persons engaged in it, citizens and foreigners, were ordered to be\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nMay the prohibition extend to the means of the party arming, or are they\r\nonly prohibited from using our means for the annoyance of their enemies?\r\nThomas Jefferson of opinion they are free to use their own means, _i. e._,\r\nto mount their own guns, &c. Hamilton and Knox of opinion they are not\r\nto put even their own implements or means into a posture of annoyance.\r\nThe President has as yet not decided this.\r\n\r\nMay an armed vessel arriving here be prohibited to employ their own\r\ncitizens found here as seamen or mariners? Thomas Jefferson,--They cannot\r\nbe prohibited to recruit their own citizens. Hamilton and Knox,--They\r\nmay and ought to be prohibited. No decision yet by the President.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me the President wished the Little Sarah had been stopped\r\nby military coercion, that is, by firing on her; yet I do not believe\r\nhe would have ordered it himself had he been here, though he would\r\nbe glad if we had ordered it. The United States being a ship-building\r\nnation, may they sell ships, prepared for war, to both parties? Thomas\r\nJefferson,--They may sell such ships in their ports to both parties,\r\nor carry them for sale to the dominions of both parties. E. Randolph\r\nof opinion they could not sell them here; and that if they attempted to\r\ncarry them to the dominions of the parties for sale, they might be seized\r\nby the way as _contraband_. Hamilton of same opinion, except that he did\r\nnot consider them as seizable for contraband, but as the property of a\r\npower, making itself a party in the _war_ by an aid of such a nature,\r\nand consequently that it would be a breach of neutrality.\r\n\r\nHamilton moves that the government of France be desired to recall Mr.\r\nGenet. Knox adds that he be in the meantime suspended from his functions.\r\nThomas Jefferson proposes that his correspondence be communicated to\r\nhis government, with friendly observations. President silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly the 15th. Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton and Knox met at the President's.\r\nGovernor Mifflin had applied to Knox for the loan of four cannon to\r\nmount at Mud Island. He informed him he should station a guard of\r\nthirty-five militia there, and asked what arrangement for rations the\r\ngeneral government had taken. Knox told him nothing could be done as to\r\nrations, and he would ask the President for the cannon. In the meantime,\r\nhe promised him to put the cannon on board a boat, ready to send off as\r\nsoon as permission was obtained. The President declared his own opinion\r\n_first_ and fully, that when the orders were given to the government to\r\nstop vessels arming, &c., in our ports, even by military force, he took\r\nfor granted the government would use such diligence as to stop those\r\nprojects in embryo, and stop them when no force was requisite, or a very\r\nsmall party of militia would suffice; that here was a demand from the\r\ngovernment of Pennsylvania to land four cannon under pretext of executing\r\norders of the general government; that if this was granted, we should\r\nbe immediately applied to by every other governor, and that not for one\r\nplace only, but for several, and our cannon would be dispersed all over\r\nthe United States; that for this reason we would refuse the same request\r\nto the governors of South Carolina, Virginia, and Rhode Island; that\r\nif they erected batteries, they must establish men for them, and would\r\ncome on us for this too. He did not think the executive had a power to\r\nestablish permanent guards: he had never looked to anything permanent\r\nwhen the orders were given to the governors, but only an occasional call\r\non small parties of militia in the moments requiring it. These sentiments\r\nwere so entirely my own, that I did little more than combat on the same\r\ngrounds the opinions of Hamilton and Knox. The latter said he would be\r\nready to lend an equal number to every government to carry into effect\r\norders of such importance; and Hamilton, that he would be willing to\r\nlend them in cases where they happened to be as near the place where\r\nthey were to be mounted.\r\n\r\nHamilton submitted the purchase of a large quantity of salt-petre, which\r\nwould outrun the funds destined to objects of that class by Congress. We\r\nwere unanimous we ought to venture on it, and to the procuring supplies\r\nof military stores in the present circumstances, and take on us the\r\nresponsibility to Congress, before whom it should be laid.\r\n\r\nThe President was fully of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the above case of the cannon, the President gave no final order while\r\nI remained; but I saw that he was so impressed with the disagreeableness\r\nof taking them out of the boat again, that he would yield. He spoke\r\nsharply to Knox for having put them in that position without consulting\r\nhim, and declared that, but for that circumstance, he would not have\r\nhesitated one moment to refuse them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly the 18th, 1793. Lear calls on me. I told him that Irving, an\r\nIrishman, and a writer in the treasury, who, on a former occasion, had\r\ngiven the most decisive proofs of his devotion to his principal, was\r\nthe author of the pieces signed Veritas; and I wished he could get at\r\nsome of Irving's acquaintances and inform himself of the fact, as the\r\nperson who told me of it would not permit the name of his informer to be\r\nmentioned; [_Note._--Beckley told me of it, and he had it from Swaine,\r\nthe printer to whom the pieces were delivered;] that I had long before\r\nsuspected this excessive foul play in that party, of writing themselves\r\nin the character of the most exaggerated democrats, and incorporating\r\nwith it a great deal of abuse on the President, to make him believe\r\nit was that party who were his enemies, and so throw him entirely into\r\nthe scale of the monocrats. Lear said he no longer ago than yesterday,\r\nexpressed to the President his suspicions of the artifices of that party\r\nto work on him. He mentioned the following fact as a proof of their\r\nwriting in the character of their adversaries; to wit, the day after\r\nthe little incident of Richet's toasting \"the man of the people,\" (see\r\nthe gazettes,) Mrs. Washington was at Mrs. Powel's, who mentioned to her\r\nthat when the toast was given, there was a good deal of disapprobation\r\nappeared in the audience, and that many put on their hats and went out;\r\non inquiry, he had not found the fact true, and yet it was put into\r\n----'s paper, and written under the character of a republican, though he\r\nis satisfied it is altogether a slander of the monocrats. He mentioned\r\nthis to the President, but he did not mention to him the following fact,\r\nwhich he knows; that in New York, the last summer, when the parties of\r\nJay and Clinton were running so high, it was an agreed point with the\r\nformer, that if any circumstances should ever bring it to a question,\r\nwhether to drop Hamilton or the President, they had decided to drop the\r\nPresident. He said that lately one of the loudest pretended friends to\r\nthe government, damned it, and said it was good for nothing, that it\r\ncould not support itself, and it was time to put it down and set up a\r\nbetter; and yet the same person, in speaking to the President, puffed\r\noff that party as the only friends to the government. He said he really\r\nfeared, that by their artifices and industry, they would aggravate the\r\nPresident so much against the republicans, as to separate him from the\r\nbody of the people. I told him what the same cabals had decided to do,\r\nif the President had refused his assent to the bank bill; also what\r\nBrockhurst Livingston said to ----, that Hamilton's life was much more\r\nprecious to the community than the President's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly the 29th, 1793. At a meeting at the President's on account of the\r\nBritish letter-of-marque, ship Jane, said to have put up waste boards, to\r\nhave pierced two port holes, and mounted two cannon (which she brought\r\nin) on new carriages which she did not bring in, and consequently\r\nhaving sixteen, instead of fourteen, guns mounted, it was agreed that a\r\nletter-of-marque, or vessel armé en guerre, and en marchandise, is not\r\na privateer, and therefore not to be ordered out of our ports. It was\r\nagreed by Hamilton, Knox, and myself, that the case of such a vessel does\r\nnot depend on the treaties, but on the law of nations. Edmund Randolph\r\nthought, as she had a mixed character of merchant vessel and privateer,\r\nshe might be considered under the treaty; but this being overruled, the\r\nfollowing paper was written\r\n\r\nRules proposed by Attorney General:\r\n\r\n1st. That all equipments purely for the accommodation of vessels, as\r\nmerchantmen, be admitted. [Agreed.]\r\n\r\n2d. That all equipments, doubtful in their nature, and applicable equally\r\nto commerce or war, be admitted, as producing too many minutia. [Agreed.]\r\n\r\n3d. That all equipments, solely adapted to military objects, be\r\nprohibited. [Agreed.]\r\n\r\nRules proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury:\r\n\r\n1st. That the original arming and equipping of vessels for military\r\nservice, offensive or defensive, in the ports of the United States, be\r\nconsidered as prohibited to all. [Agreed.]\r\n\r\n2d. That vessels which were armed before their coming into our ports,\r\nshall not be permitted to augment these equipments in the ports of the\r\nUnited States, but may repair or replace any military equipments which\r\nthey had when they began their voyage for the United States; that this,\r\nhowever, shall be with the exception of privateers of the parties opposed\r\nto France, who shall not refit or repair. [Negatived--the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury only holding the opinion.]\r\n\r\n3d. That for convenience, vessels armed and commissioned before they come\r\ninto our ports, may engage their own citizens, not being inhabitants of\r\nthe United States. [Agreed.]\r\n\r\nI subjoined the following:\r\n\r\nI concur in the rules proposed by the Attorney General, as far as respects\r\nmaterials or means of annoyance furnished by us; and I should be for an\r\nadditional rule, that as to means or materials brought into this country,\r\nand belonging to themselves, they are free to use them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 1st. Met at the President's, to consider what was to be\r\ndone with Mr. Genet. All his correspondence with me was read over.\r\nThe following propositions were made: 1. That a full statement of Mr.\r\nGenet's conduct be made in a letter to G. Morris, and be sent with his\r\ncorrespondence, to be communicated to the Executive Council of France;\r\nthe letter to be so prepared, as to serve for the form of communication\r\nto the Council. Agreed unanimously. 2. That in that letter his recall be\r\nrequired. Agreed by all, though I expressed a preference of expressing\r\nthat desire with great delicacy; the others were for peremptory terms.\r\n3. To send him off. This was proposed by Knox; but rejected by every\r\nother. 4. To write a letter to Mr. Genet, the same in substance with that\r\nwritten to G. Morris, and let him know we had applied for his recall. I\r\nwas against this, because I thought it would render him extremely active\r\nin his plans, and endanger confusion. But I was overruled by the other\r\nthree gentlemen and the President. 5. That a publication of the whole\r\ncorrespondence, and statement of the proceedings, should be made by way\r\nof appeal to the people. Hamilton made a jury speech of three-quarters\r\nof an hour, as inflammatory and declamatory as if he had been speaking\r\nto a jury. E. Randolph opposed it. I chose to leave the contest between\r\nthem. Adjourned to next day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 2d. Met again. Hamilton spoke again three-quarters of an\r\nhour. I answered on these topics. _Object_ of the appeal.--The democratic\r\nsociety; this the great circumstance of alarm; afraid it would extend its\r\nconnections over the continent; chiefly meant for the local object of the\r\nensuing election of Governor. If left alone, would die away after that\r\nis over. If opposed, if proscribed, would give it importance and vigor;\r\nwould give it a new object, and multitudes would join it merely to assert\r\nthe right of voluntary associations. That the measure was calculated to\r\nmake the President assume the station of the head of a party, instead\r\nof the head of the nation. _Plan_ of the appeal.--To consist of _facts_\r\nand the _decisions_ of the President. As to facts we are agreed; but as\r\nto the decisions, there have been great differences of opinion among\r\nus. Sometimes as many opinions as persons. This proves there will be\r\nground to attack the decisions. Genet will appeal also; it will become\r\na contest between the President and Genet--anonymous writers--will\r\nbe same difference of opinion in _public_, as in our cabinet--will be\r\nsame difference in _Congress_, for it must be laid before them--would,\r\ntherefore, work very unpleasantly _at home_. How would it work _abroad_?\r\nFrance--unkind--after such proofs of her friendship, should rely on that\r\nfriendship, and her justice. Why appeal to the world? Friendly nations\r\nalways negotiate little differences in private. Never appeal to the\r\nworld, but when they appeal to the sword. Confederacy of Pilnitz was to\r\noverthrow the government of France. The interference of France to disturb\r\nother governments and excite insurrections, was a measure of reprisal.\r\nYet these Princes have been able to make it believed to be the system\r\nof France. Colonel Hamilton supposes Mr. Genet's proceedings here are\r\nin pursuance of that system; and we are so to declare it to the world,\r\nand to add our testimony to this base calumny of the Princes. What a\r\ntriumph to them to be backed by our testimony. What a fatal stroke at the\r\ncause of liberty; _et tu Brute_. We indispose the French government, and\r\nthey will retract their offer of the treaty of commerce. The President\r\nmanifestly inclined to the appeal to the people.[11] Knox, in a foolish\r\nincoherent sort of a speech, introduced the pasquinade lately printed,\r\ncalled the funeral of George W--n, and James W--n, King and Judge, &c.,\r\nwhere the President was placed on a guillotine. The President was much\r\ninflamed; got into one of those passions when he cannot command himself;\r\nran on much on the personal abuse which had been bestowed on him; defied\r\nany man on earth to produce one single act of his since he had been in\r\nthe government, which was not done on the purest motives; that he had\r\nnever repented but once the having slipped the moment of resigning his\r\noffice, and that was every moment since; that _by God_ he had rather\r\nbe in his grave than in his present situation; that he had rather be\r\non his farm than to be made _Emperor of the world_; and yet that they\r\nwere charging him with wanting to be a King. That that _rascal Freneau_\r\nsent him three of his papers every day, as if he thought he would become\r\nthe distributor of his papers; that he could see in this, nothing but\r\nan impudent design to insult him: he ended in this high tone. There\r\nwas a pause. Some difficulty in resuming our question; it was, however,\r\nafter a little while, presented again, and he said there seemed to be no\r\nnecessity for deciding it now; the propositions before agreed on might\r\nbe put into a train of execution, and perhaps events would show whether\r\nthe appeal would be necessary or not. He desired we would meet at my\r\noffice the next day, to consider what should be done with the vessels\r\narmed in our ports by Mr. Genet, and their prizes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 3d. We met. The President wrote to take our opinions, whether\r\nCongress should be called. Knox pronounced at once against it. Randolph\r\nwas against it. Hamilton said his judgment was against it, but that if any\r\ntwo were for it, or against it, he would join them to make a majority. I\r\nwas for it. We agreed to give separate opinions to the President. Knox\r\nsaid we should have had fine work, if Congress had been sitting these\r\ntwo last months. The fool thus let out the secret. Hamilton endeavored\r\nto patch up the indiscretion of this blabber, by saying \"he did not\r\nknow; he rather thought they would have strengthened the executive arm.\"\r\nIt is evident they do not wish to lengthen the session of the _next\r\nCongress_, and probably they particularly wish it should not meet till\r\nGenet is gone. At this meeting I received a letter from Mr. Remson at\r\nNew York, informing me of the event of the combat between the Ambuscade\r\nand the Boston. Knox broke out into the most unqualified abuse of Captain\r\nCourtany. Hamilton, with less fury, but with the deepest vexation, loaded\r\nhim with censures. Both showed the most unequivocal mortification at\r\nthe event.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 6th, 1793. The President calls on me at my house in the\r\ncountry, and introduces my letter of July the 31st, announcing that I\r\nshould resign at the close of the next month. He again expressed his\r\nrepentance at not having resigned himself, and how much it was increased\r\nby seeing that he was to be deserted by those on whose aid he had counted;\r\nthat he did not know where he should look to find characters to fill\r\nup the offices; that mere talents did not suffice for the department of\r\nState, but it required a person conversant in foreign affairs, perhaps\r\nacquainted with foreign courts; that without this, the best talents would\r\nbe awkward and at a loss. He told me that Colonel Hamilton had three\r\nor four weeks ago written to him, informing him that private as well as\r\npublic reasons had brought him to the determination to retire, and that\r\nhe should do it towards the close of the next session. He said he had\r\noften before intimated dispositions to resign, but never as decisively\r\nbefore; that he supposed he had fixed on the latter part of next session,\r\nto give an opportunity to Congress to examine into his conduct; that\r\nour going out at times so different, increased his difficulty; for if\r\nhe had both places to fill at once, he might consult both the particular\r\ntalents and geographical situation of our successors. He expressed great\r\napprehensions at the fermentation which seemed to be working in the mind\r\nof the public; that many descriptions of persons, actuated by different\r\ncauses, appeared to be uniting; what it would end in he knew not; a new\r\nCongress was to assemble, more numerous, perhaps of a different spirit;\r\nthe first expressions of their sentiments would be important; if I would\r\nonly stay to the end of that, it would relieve him considerably.\r\n\r\nI expressed to him my excessive repugnance to public life, the particular\r\nuneasiness of my situation in this place, where the laws of society\r\noblige me always to move exactly in the circle which I know to bear me\r\npeculiar hatred; that is to say, the wealthy aristocrats, the merchants\r\nconnected closely with England, the new created paper fortunes; that\r\nthus surrounded, my words were caught, multiplied, misconstrued, and even\r\nfabricated and spread abroad to my injury; that he saw also, that there\r\nwas such an opposition of views between myself and another part of the\r\nadministration, as to render it peculiarly unpleasing, and to destroy\r\nthe necessary harmony. Without knowing the views of what is called the\r\nrepublican party here, or having any communication with them, I could\r\nundertake to assure him, from my intimacy with that party in the late\r\nCongress, that there was not a view in the republican party as spread\r\nover the United States, which went to the frame of the government; that\r\nI believed the next Congress would attempt nothing material, but to\r\nrender their own body independent; that that party were firm in their\r\ndispositions to support the government; that the manœuvres of Mr. Genet\r\nmight produce some little embarrassment, but that he would be abandoned\r\nby the republicans the moment they knew the nature of his conduct; and\r\non the whole, no crisis existed which threatened anything.\r\n\r\nHe said he believed the views of the republican party were perfectly\r\npure, but when men put a machine into motion, it is impossible for them\r\nto stop it exactly where they would choose, or to say where it will\r\nstop. That the constitution we have is an excellent one, if we can keep\r\nit where it is; that it was, indeed, supposed there was a party disposed\r\nto change it into a monarchical form, but that he could conscientiously\r\ndeclare there was not a man in the United States who would set his\r\nface more decidedly against it than himself. Here I interrupted him, by\r\nsaying, \"No rational man in the United States suspects you of any other\r\ndisposition; but there does not pass a week, in which we cannot prove\r\ndeclarations dropping from the monarchical party that our government is\r\ngood for nothing, is a milk and water thing which cannot support itself,\r\nwe must knock it down, and set up something of more energy.\" He said if\r\nthat was the case, he thought it a proof of their insanity, for that\r\nthe republican spirit of the Union was so manifest and so solid, that\r\nit was astonishing how any one could expect to move it.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the difficulty of naming my successor; he said Mr.\r\nMadison would be his first choice, but that he had always expressed to\r\nhim such a decision against public office, that he could not expect he\r\nwould undertake it. Mr. Jay would prefer his present office. He said\r\nthat Mr. Jay had a great opinion of the talents of Mr. King; that there\r\nwas also Mr. Smith of South Carolina, and E. Rutledge; but he observed,\r\nthat name whom he would, some objections would be made, some would be\r\ncalled speculators, some one thing, some another; and he asked me to\r\nmention any characters occurring to me. I asked him if Governor Johnson\r\nof Maryland had occurred to him? He said he had; that he was a man of\r\ngreat good sense, an honest man, and he believed, clear of speculations;\r\nbut this, says he, is an instance of what I was observing; with all\r\nthese qualifications, Governor Johnson, from a want of familiarity with\r\nforeign affairs, would be in them like a fish out of water; everything\r\nwould be new to him, and he awkward in everything. I confessed to him\r\nthat I had considered Johnson rather as fit for the Treasury Department.\r\nYes, says he, for that he would be the fittest appointment that could be\r\nmade; he is a man acquainted with figures, and having as good a knowledge\r\nof the resources of this country as any man. I asked him if Chancellor\r\nLivingston had occurred to him? He said yes; but he was from New York,\r\nand to appoint him while Hamilton was in, and before it should be known\r\nhe was going out, would excite a newspaper conflagration, as the ultimate\r\narrangement would not be known. He said McLurg had occurred to him as\r\na man of first-rate abilities, but it is said that he is a speculator.\r\nHe asked me what sort of a man Wolcott was. I told him I knew nothing\r\nof him myself; I had heard him characterized as a cunning man. I asked\r\nhim whether some person could not take my office _par interim_, till he\r\nshould make an appointment, as Mr. Randolph, for instance. Yes, says\r\nhe, but there you would raise the expectation of keeping it, and I do\r\nnot know that he is fit for it, nor what is thought of Mr. Randolph.\r\nI avoided noticing the last observation, and he put the question to me\r\ndirectly. I then told him, I went into society so little as to be unable\r\nto answer it: I knew that the embarrassments in his private affairs had\r\nobliged him to use expedients, which had injured him with the merchants\r\nand shop-keepers, and affected his character of independence; that\r\nthese embarrassments were serious, and not likely to cease soon. He\r\nsaid if I would only stay in till the end of another quarter (the last\r\nof December) it would get us through the difficulties of this year,\r\nand he was satisfied that the affairs of Europe would be settled with\r\nthis campaign; for that either France would be overwhelmed by it, or\r\nthe confederacy would give up the contest. By that time, too, Congress\r\nwill have manifested its character and view. I told him that I had set\r\nmy private affairs in motion in a line which had powerfully called for\r\nmy presence the last spring, and that they had suffered immensely from\r\nmy not going home; that I had now calculated them to my return in the\r\nfall, and to fail in going then, would be the loss of another year, and\r\nprejudicial beyond measure. I asked him whether he could not name Governor\r\nJohnson to my office, under an express arrangement that at the close of\r\nthe session he should take that of the Treasury. He said that men never\r\nchose to descend; that being once in a higher department, he would not\r\nlike to go into a lower one. He asked me whether I could not arrange my\r\naffairs by going home. I told him I did not think the public business\r\nwould admit of it; that there never was a day now in which the absence\r\nof the Secretary of State would not be inconvenient to the public. And\r\nhe concluded by desiring that I would take two or three days to consider\r\nwhether I could not stay in till the end of another quarter, for that\r\nlike a man going to the gallows, he was willing to put it off as long\r\nas he could; but if I persisted, he must then look about him and make\r\nup his mind to do the best he could; and so he took leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 20th. We met at the President's to examine by paragraphs the\r\ndraught of a letter I had prepared to Gouverneur Morris on the conduct of\r\nMr. Genet. There was no difference of opinion on any part of it, except\r\non this expression, \"An attempt to embroil both, to add still another\r\nnation to the enemies of his country, and to draw on both a reproach which\r\nit is hoped will never stain the history of either, that of _liberty\r\nwarring on herself_.\" Hamilton moved to strike out these words, \"that\r\nof liberty warring on herself.\" He urged generally that it would give\r\noffence to the combined powers; that it amounted to a declaration that\r\nthey were warring on liberty; that we were not called on to declare\r\nthat the cause of France was that of liberty; that he had at first been\r\nwith them with all his heart, but that he had long since left them, and\r\nwas not for encouraging the idea here, that the cause of France was the\r\ncause of liberty in general, or could have either connection or influence\r\nin our affairs. Knox, according to custom, jumped plump into all his\r\nopinions. The President, with a good deal of positiveness, declared in\r\nfavor of the expression; that he considered the pursuit of France to be\r\nthat of liberty, however they might sometimes fail of the best means\r\nof obtaining it; that he had never at any time entertained a doubt of\r\ntheir ultimate success, if they hung well together; and that as to their\r\ndissensions, there were such contradictory accounts given, that no one\r\ncould tell what to believe. I observed that it had been supposed among\r\nus all along that the present letter might become public; that we had\r\ntherefore three parties to attend to,--1st, France; 2d, her enemies 3d,\r\nthe people of the United States; that as to the enemies of France, it\r\nought not to offend them, because the passage objected to, only spoke of\r\nan attempt to make the United States, a _free nation_, war on France,\r\na _free nation_, which would be liberty warring against liberty; that\r\nas to France, we were taking so harsh a measure (desiring her to recall\r\nher minister) that a precedent for it could scarcely be found; that we\r\nknew that minister would represent to his government that our executive\r\nwas hostile to liberty, leaning to monarchy, and would endeavor to parry\r\nthe charges on himself, by rendering suspicions the source from which\r\nthey flowed; that, therefore, it was essential to satisfy France, not\r\nonly of our friendship to her, but our attachment to the general cause\r\nof liberty, and to hers in particular; that as to the people of the\r\nUnited States, we knew there were suspicions abroad that the executive,\r\nin some of its parts, was tainted with a hankering after monarchy, an\r\nindisposition towards liberty, and towards the French cause; and that it\r\nwas important, by an explicit declaration, to remove these suspicions,\r\nand restore the confidence of the people in their government. Randolph\r\nopposed the passage on nearly the same ground with Hamilton. He added,\r\nthat he thought it had been agreed that this correspondence should contain\r\nno expressions which could give offence to either party. I replied that\r\nit had been my opinion in the beginning of the correspondence, that\r\nwhile we were censuring the conduct of the French minister, we should\r\nmake the most cordial declarations of friendship to them; that in the\r\nfirst letter or two of the correspondence, I had inserted expressions\r\nof that kind, but that himself and the other two gentlemen had struck\r\nthem out; that I thereupon conformed to their opinions in my subsequent\r\nletters, and had carefully avoided the insertion of a single term of\r\nfriendship to the French nation, and the letters were as dry and husky\r\nas if written between the generals of two enemy nations; that on the\r\npresent occasion, how ever, it had been agreed that such expressions\r\nought to be inserted in the letter now under consideration, and I had\r\naccordingly charged it pretty well with them; that I had further thought\r\nit essential to satisfy the French and our own citizens of the light in\r\nwhich we viewed their cause, and of our fellow feeling for the general\r\ncause of liberty, and had ventured only four words on the subject; that\r\nthere was not from beginning to end of the letter one other expression\r\nor word in favor of liberty, and I should think it singular, at least,\r\nif the single passage of that character should be struck out.\r\n\r\nThe President again spoke. He came into the idea that attention was\r\ndue to the two parties who had been mentioned, France and the United\r\nStates; that as to the former, thinking it certain their affairs would\r\nissue in a government of some sort--of considerable freedom--it was the\r\nonly nation with whom our relations could be counted on; that as to the\r\nUnited States, there could be no doubt of their universal attachment\r\nto the cause of France, and of the solidity of their republicanism. He\r\ndeclared his strong attachment to the expression, but finally left it\r\nto us to accommodate. It was struck out, of course, and the expressions\r\nof affection in the context were a good deal taken down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 23d, 1793. In consequence of my note of yesterday to the\r\nPresident, a meeting was called this day at his house to determine what\r\nshould be done with the proposition of France to treat. The importance\r\nof the matter was admitted; and being of so old a date as May 22d, we\r\nmight be accused of neglecting the interests of the United States, to\r\nhave left it so long unanswered, and it could not be doubted Mr. Genet\r\nwould avail himself of this inattention. The President declared it had\r\nnot been inattention, that it had been the subject of conversation often\r\nat our meetings, and the delay had proceeded from the difficulty of the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIf the struggles of France should end in the old despotism, the formation\r\nof such a treaty with the present government would be a matter of offence;\r\nif it should end in any kind of free government, he should be very\r\nunwilling, by inattention to their advances, to give offence, and lose\r\nthe opportunity of procuring terms so advantageous to our country. He\r\nwas, therefore, for writing to Mr. Morris to get the powers of Mr. Genet\r\nrenewed to his successor. [As he had expressed this opinion to me the\r\nafternoon before, I had prepared the draught of a letter accordingly.]\r\nBut how to explain the delay? The Secretary of the Treasury observed on\r\nthe letter of the National Convention, that as it did not seem to require\r\nan answer, and the matters it contained would occasion embarrassment\r\nif answered, he should be against answering it; that he should be for\r\nwriting to Mr. Morris, mentioning our readiness to treat with them, and\r\nsuggesting a renewal of Mr. Genet's powers to his successor, but not\r\nin as strong terms as I had done in my draught of the letter--not as\r\na thing anxiously wished for by us, lest it should suggest to them the\r\nasking a price; and he was for my writing to Mr. Genet _now_, an answer\r\nto his letter of May 22d, referring to the meeting of the Senate the\r\nentering on the treaty. Knox concurred with him, the Attorney General\r\nalso,--except that he was against suggesting the renewal of Mr. Genet's\r\npowers, because that would amount to a declaration that we would treat\r\nwith that government, would commit us to lay the subject before the\r\nSenate, and his principle had ever been to do no act, not unavoidably\r\nnecessary, which, in the event of a counter revolution, might offend the\r\nfuture governing powers of that country. I stated to them that having\r\nobserved from our conversations that the propositions to treat might not\r\nbe acceded to immediately, I had endeavored to prepare Mr. Genet for it,\r\nby taking occasion in conversations to apprize him of the control over\r\ntreaties which our constitution had given to the Senate; that though\r\nthis was indirectly done, (because not having been authorized to say\r\nanything official on the subject, I did not venture to commit myself\r\ndirectly,) yet, on some subsequent conversation, I found it had struck\r\nhim exactly as I had wished; for, speaking on some other matter, he\r\nmentioned incidentally his propositions to treat, and said, however, as\r\nI know now that you cannot take up that subject till the meeting of the\r\nSenate, I shall say no more about it now, and so proceeded with his other\r\nsubject, which I do not now recollect. I said I thought it possible by\r\nrecalling the substance of these conversations to Mr. Genet, in a letter\r\nto be written now, I might add that the Executive had at length come\r\nto a conclusion, that on account of the importance of the matter, they\r\nwould await the meeting of the Senate; but I pressed strongly the urging\r\nMr. Morris to procure a renewal of Genet's powers, that we might not\r\nlose the chance of obtaining so advantageous a treaty. Edmund Randolph\r\nhad argued against our acceding to it, because it was too advantageous;\r\nso much so that they would certainly break it, and it might become the\r\ncause of war. I answered that it would be easy, in the course of the\r\nnegociation, to cure it of its inequality by giving some compensation;\r\nbut I had no fear of their revoking it, that the islanders themselves\r\nwere too much interested in the concessions ever to suffer them to be\r\nrevoked; that the best thinkers in France had long been of opinion that\r\nit would be for the interest of the mother country to let the colonies\r\nobtain subsistence wherever they could cheapest; that I was confident\r\nthe present struggles in France would end in a free government of some\r\nsort, and that such a government would consider itself as growing out of\r\nthe present one, and respect its treaties. The President recurred to the\r\nawkwardness of writing a letter now to Mr. Genet, in answer to his of May\r\n22d; that it would certainly be construed as merely done with a design\r\nof exculpation of ourselves, and he would thence inculpate us. The more\r\nwe reflected on this, the more the justice of the observation struck us.\r\nHamilton and myself came into it--Knox still for the letter--Randolph\r\nhalf for it, half against it, according to custom.\r\n\r\nIt was at length agreed I should state the substance of my verbal\r\nobservations to Mr. Genet, in a letter to Mr. Morris, and let them be\r\nconsidered as the answer intended; for being from the Secretary of State,\r\nthey might be considered as official, though not in writing.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that taking this ground for their future justification to\r\nFrance and to the United States, they were sensible they had censurably\r\nneglected these overtures of treaty; for not only what I had said to\r\nMr. Genet was without authority from them, but was never communicated\r\nto them till this day. To rest the justification of delay on answers\r\ngiven, it is true in time; but of which they had no knowledge till now,\r\nis an ostensible justification only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember the 4th, 1793. At a meeting held some days ago, some letters\r\nfrom the Governor of Georgia were read, in which a consultation of\r\nofficers, and a considerable expedition against the Creeks was proposed.\r\nWe were all of opinion no such expedition should be undertaken. My reasons\r\nwere that such a war might bring on a Spanish, and even an English war;\r\nthat for this reason the aggressions of the Creeks had been laid before\r\nthe last Congress, and they had not chosen to declare war, therefore the\r\nExecutive should not take on itself to do it; and that according to the\r\nopinions of Pickens and Blount, it was too late in the season.\r\n\r\nI thought, however, that a temperate and conciliatory letter should be\r\nwritten to the Governor, in order that we might retain the disposition\r\nof the people of the State to assist in an expedition when undertaken.\r\nThe other gentlemen thought a strong letter of disapprobation should be\r\nwritten. Such a one was this day produced, strong and reprehendatory\r\nenough, in which I thought were visible the personal enmities of Knox\r\nand Hamilton, against Telfair, Gun, and Jackson--the two last having\r\nbeen of the council of officers. The letter passed without objection,\r\nbeing of the complexion before determined.\r\n\r\nWayne's letter was read, proposing that six hundred militia should\r\nset out from Fort Pitt to attack certain Miami towns, while he marched\r\nagainst the principal towns. The President disapproved it, because of\r\nthe difficulty of concerted movements at six hundred miles distance;\r\nbecause these six hundred men might, and probably would have the whole\r\nforce of the Indians to contend with; and because the object was not\r\nworth the risking such a number of men. We all concurred. It appeared\r\nto me, further, that to begin an expedition from Fort Pitt, the very\r\nfirst order for which is to be given now, when we have reason to believe\r\nWayne advanced as far as Fort Jefferson, would be either too late for\r\nhis movements, or would retard them very injuriously. [_Note._--The\r\nletters from the Commissioners were now read, announcing the refusal of\r\nthe Indians to treat, unless the Ohio were made the boundary; and that\r\nthey were on their return.]\r\n\r\nA letter from Governor Clinton read, informing of his issuing a warrant\r\nto arrest Governor Galbaud, at the request of the French Consul, and\r\nthat he was lead to interfere because the judge of the district lived at\r\nAlbany. It was proposed to write to the judge of the district, that the\r\nplace of his residence was not adapted to his duties; and to Clinton,\r\nthat Galbaud was not liable to arrest. Hamilton said, that by the laws\r\nof New York, the Governor has the powers of a justice of peace, and had\r\nissued the warrant as such.\r\n\r\nI was against writing letters to judiciary officers. I thought them\r\nindependent of the Executive, not subject to its coercion, and, therefore,\r\nnot obliged to attend to its admonitions.\r\n\r\nThe other three were for writing the letters. They thought it the duty\r\nof the President to see that the laws were executed; and if he found a\r\nfailure in so important an officer, to communicate it to the legislature\r\nfor impeachment.\r\n\r\nEdmund Randolph undertook to write the letters, and I am to sign them\r\nas if mine. The President brought forward the subject of the ports, and\r\nthought a new demand of answer should be made to Mr. Hammond. As we had\r\nnot Mr. Hammond's last answer (of June 20th) on that subject, agreed to\r\nlet it lie over to Monday.\r\n\r\nHammond proposed, that on Monday we should take into consideration the\r\nfortification of the rivers and ports of the United States, and that\r\nthough the Executive could not undertake to do it, preparatory surveys\r\nshould be made to be laid before Congress, to be considered on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe letters to Genet covering a copy of mine to Gov. Morris--of ---- to\r\nthe French consuls, threatening the revocation of their Exequaturs--to\r\nMr. Pinckney on the additional instructions of Great Britain to their\r\nnavy for shipping our corn, flour, &c., and to Gov. Morris on the similar\r\norder of the French National Assembly, are to be ready on Monday.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Mr. Hammond, in answer to his of August 30th, was read\r\nand approved. Hamilton wished not to narrow the ground of compensation\r\nso much as to cases after August 7th. Knox joined him, and by several\r\nobservations showed he did not know what the question was. He could not\r\ncomprehend that the letter of August 7th, which promised compensation\r\n(because we had not used all the means in our power for restricting),\r\nwould not be contradicted by a refusal to compensate in cases after\r\nAugust 7th, where we should naturally use all the means in our power\r\nfor restriction, and these means should be insufficient. The letter was\r\nagreed to on Mr. Randolph's opinion and mine; Hamilton acquiescing, Knox\r\nopposing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt sundry meetings of the Heads of departments and Attorney General,\r\nfrom the 1st to the 28th of November, 1793, at the President's, several\r\nmatters were agreed upon, as stated in the following letters from the\r\nSecretary of State, to wit:--\r\n\r\nNovember the 8th. Circular letter to the representatives of France,\r\nGreat Britain, Spain, and the United Netherlands, fixing provisionally\r\nthe extent of our jurisdiction into the sea at a sea league.\r\n\r\n10th. Circular letter to the district attorneys, notifying the same,\r\nand committing to them the taking depositions in those cases.\r\n\r\n10th. Circular to the foreign representatives, notifying how depositions\r\nare to be taken in those cases.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the preceding letters was agreed to by all; the rough\r\ndrafts were submitted to them and approved.\r\n\r\nNovember the 14th. To Mr. Hammond, that the United States are not bound\r\nto restore the Roehampton. This was agreed by all. The rough draught was\r\nsubmitted to and approved by Colonel Hamilton and Mr. Randolph. General\r\nKnox was on a visit to Trenton.\r\n\r\n10th. Letters to Mr. Genet and Hammond, and the 14th to Mr. Hollingsworth,\r\nfor taking depositions in the cases of the Conningham and Pilgrim.\r\n\r\n13th. Ditto, to Mr. Genet, Hammond, and Bowle, for depositions in the\r\ncase of the William.\r\n\r\n14th. Ditto, to Hollingsworth, to ascertain whether Mr. Moissonier had\r\npassed sentenced on the Rochampton and Pilgrim.\r\n\r\nThese last-mentioned letters of the 10th, 13th, and 14th were, as to\r\ntheir substance, agreed to by all, the draughts were only communicated\r\nto Mr. Randolph, and approved by him.\r\n\r\nNovember the 13th. To Mr. Hammond, inquiring when we shall have an\r\nanswer on the inexecution of the treaty. The substance agreed by all.\r\nThe letter was sent off without communication, none of the gentlemen\r\nbeing at Germantown.\r\n\r\n22d. To Mr. Genet, returning the commissions of Pennevert and Chervi,\r\nbecause not addressed to the President.\r\n\r\n22d. To Mr. Genet, inquiring whether the Lovely-Lass, Prince William\r\nHenry, and Jane, of Dublin, have been given up; and if not, requiring\r\nthat they be restored to owners. These were agreed to by all, as to their\r\nmatter, and the letters themselves were submitted before they were sent\r\nto the President, the Secretary of War, and the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n22d. To Mr. Gore, for authentic evidence of Dannery's protest on the\r\nPresident's revocation of Duplaine's Exequatur. The substance agreed by\r\nall. The letter sent off before communication.\r\n\r\n                                                    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n                                                    HENRY KNOX.\r\n                                                    EDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n                                                    ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nNovember 23d, 1793.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 5th, 1793. E. Randolph tells me, that Hamilton, in\r\nconversation with him yesterday, said, \"Sir, if all the people in America\r\nwere now assembled, and to call on me to say whether I am a friend to\r\nthe French revolution, I would declare that _I have it in abhorrence_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 8th, 1793. At a conference at the President's, where I\r\nread several letters of Mr. Genet; on finishing one of them, I asked\r\nwhat should be the answer? The President thereupon took occasion to\r\nobserve, that Mr. Genet's conduct continued to be of so extraordinary a\r\nnature, that he meant to propose to our serious consideration, whether\r\nhe should not have his functions discontinued, and be ordered away? He\r\nwent lengthily into observations on his conduct, to raise against the\r\nexecutive, 1, the people; 2, the State governments; 3, the Congress.\r\nHe showed he felt the venom of Genet's pen, but declared he would not\r\nchoose his insolence should be regarded any further, than as might be\r\nthought to affect the honor of the country. Hamilton and Knox readily\r\nand zealously argued for dismissing Mr. Genet. Randolph opposed it with\r\nfirmness, and pretty lengthily. The President replied to him lengthily,\r\nand concluded by saying he did not wish to have the thing hastily decided,\r\nbut that we should consider of it, and give our opinions on his return\r\nfrom Reading and Lancaster.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, November the 18th, we met at his house; read new volumes\r\nof Genet's letters, received since the President's departure; then took\r\nup the discussion of the subjects of communication to Congress. 1. The\r\nProclamation. E. Randolph read the statement he had prepared; Hamilton\r\ndid not like it; said much about his own views; that the President had a\r\nright to declare his opinion to our citizens and foreign nations; that\r\nit was not the interest of this country to join in the war, and that\r\nwe were under no obligation to join in it; that though the declaration\r\nwould not legally bind Congress, yet the President had a right to give\r\nhis opinion of it, and he was against any explanation in the speech,\r\nwhich should yield that he did not intend that foreign nations should\r\nconsider it as a declaration of neutrality, future as well as present;\r\nthat he understood it as meant to give them that sort of assurance and\r\nsatisfaction, and to say otherwise now, would be a deception on them. He\r\nwas for the President's using such expressions, as should neither affirm\r\nhis right to make such a declaration to foreign nations, nor yield it.\r\nRandolph and myself opposed the right of the President to declare anything\r\nfuture on the question, shall there or shall there not be war, and that\r\nno such thing was intended; that Hamilton's construction of the effect\r\nof the proclamation, would have been a determination of the question of\r\nthe _guarantee_, which we both denied to have intended, and I had at the\r\ntime declared the executive incompetent to. Randolph said he meant that\r\nforeign nations should understand it as an intimation of the President's\r\nopinion, that neutrality would be our interest. I declared my meaning to\r\nhave been, that foreign nations should understand no such thing; that on\r\nthe contrary, I would have chosen them to be doubtful, and to come and\r\nbid for our neutrality. I admitted the President, having received the\r\nnation at the close of Congress in a state of peace, was bound to preserve\r\nthem in that state till Congress should meet again, and might proclaim\r\nanything which went no farther. The President declared he never had an\r\nidea that he could bind Congress against declaring war, or that anything\r\ncontained in his proclamation could look beyond the first day of their\r\nmeeting. His main view was to keep our people in peace; he apologized\r\nfor the use of the term neutrality in his answers, and justified it, by\r\nhaving submitted the first of them (that to the merchants, wherein it\r\nwas used) to our consideration, and we had not objected to the term. He\r\nconcluded in the end, that Colonel Hamilton should prepare a paragraph\r\non this subject for the speech, and it should then be considered. We\r\nwere here called to dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the _renvoi_ of Genet was proposed by himself. I opposed\r\nit on these topics. France, the only nation on earth sincerely our\r\nfriend. The measure so harsh a one, that no precedent is produced\r\nwhere it has not been followed by war. Our messenger has now been gone\r\neighty-four days; consequently, we may hourly expect the return, and\r\nto be relieved by their revocation of him. Were it now resolved on, it\r\nwould be eight or ten days before the matter on which the order should\r\nbe founded, could be selected, arranged, discussed, and forwarded. This\r\nwould bring us within four or five days of the meeting of Congress.\r\nWould it not be better to wait and see how the pulse of that body, new\r\nas it is, would beat. They are with us now, probably, but such a step\r\nas this may carry many over to Genet's side. Genet will not obey the\r\norder, &c., &c. The President asked me what I would do if Genet sent the\r\naccusation to us to be communicated to Congress, as he threatened in the\r\nletter to Moultrie? I said I would not sent it to Congress; but either\r\nput it in the newspapers, or send it back to him to be published if he\r\npleased. Other questions and answers were put and returned in a quicker\r\naltercation than I ever before saw the President use. Hamilton was for\r\nthe _renvoi_; spoke much of the dignity of the nation; that they were\r\nnow to form their character; that our conduct now would tempt or deter\r\nother foreign ministers from treating us in the same manner; touched\r\non the President's personal feelings; did not believe France would make\r\nit a cause of war; if she did, we ought to do what was right, and meet\r\nthe consequences, &c. Knox on the same side, and said he thought it\r\nvery possible Mr. Genet would either declare us a department of France,\r\nor levy troops here and endeavor to reduce us to obedience. Randolph\r\nof my opinion, and argued chiefly on the resurrection of popularity to\r\nGenet, which might be produced by this measure. That at present he was\r\ndead in the public opinion, if we would but leave him so. The President\r\nlamented there was not unanimity among us; that as it was, we had left\r\nhim exactly where we found him; and so it ended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 21st. We met at the President's. The manner of explaining\r\nto Congress the intentions of the proclamation, was the matter of\r\ndebate. Randolph produced his way of stating it. This expressed its\r\nviews to have been, 1, to keep our citizens quiet; 2, to intimate to\r\nforeign nations that it was the President's opinion, that the interests\r\nand dispositions of this country were for peace. Hamilton produced his\r\nstatement, in which he declared his intention to be, to say nothing\r\nwhich could be laid hold of for any purpose; to leave the proclamation\r\nto explain itself. He entered pretty fully into all the argumentation\r\nof Pacificus; he justified the right of the President to declare his\r\nopinion for a _future neutrality_, and that there existed no circumstances\r\nto oblige the United States to enter into the war on account of the\r\nguarantee; and that in agreeing to the proclamation, he meant it to be\r\nunderstood as conveying both those declarations; viz. neutrality, and\r\nthat the _casus fœderis_ on the guarantee did not exist. He admitted\r\nthe Congress might declare war, notwithstanding these declarations of\r\nthe President. In like manner, they might declare war in the face of a\r\ntreaty, and in direct infraction of it. Among other positions laid down\r\nby him, this was with great positiveness; that the constitution having\r\ngiven power to the President and Senate to make treaties, they might\r\nmake a treaty of neutrality which should take from Congress the right to\r\ndeclare war in that particular case, and that under the form of a treaty\r\nthey might exercise any powers whatever, even those exclusively given by\r\nthe constitution to the House of Representatives. Randolph opposed this\r\nposition, and seemed to think that where they undertook to do acts by\r\ntreaty, (as to settle a tariff of duties,) which were exclusively given\r\nto the Legislature, that an act of the Legislature would be necessary\r\nto confirm them, as happens in England, when a treaty interferes with\r\nduties established by law. I insisted that in giving to the President\r\nand Senate a power to make treaties, the constitution meant only to\r\nauthorize them to carry into effect, by way of treaty, any powers they\r\nmight constitutionally exercise. I was sensible of the weak points in\r\nthis position, but there were still weaker in the other hypothesis; and\r\nif it be impossible to discover a rational measure of authority to have\r\nbeen given by this clause, I would rather suppose that the cases which my\r\nhypothesis would leave unprovided, were not thought of by the convention,\r\nor if thought of, could not be agreed on, or were thought of and deemed\r\nunnecessary to be invested in the government. Of this last description,\r\nwere treaties of neutrality, treaties offensive and defensive, &c. In\r\nevery event, I would rather construe so narrowly as to oblige the nation\r\nto amend, and thus declare what powers they would agree to yield, than\r\ntoo broadly, and indeed, so broadly as to enable the executive and\r\nSenate to do things which the constitution forbids. On the question,\r\nwhich form of explaining the principles of the proclamation should be\r\nadopted, I declared for Randolph's, though it gave to that instrument\r\nmore objects than I had contemplated. Knox declared for Hamilton's. The\r\nPresident said he had had but one object, the keeping our people quiet\r\ntill Congress should meet; that nevertheless, to declare he did not mean\r\na declaration of neutrality, in the technical sense of the phrase, might\r\nperhaps be crying _peccavi_ before he was charged. However, he did not\r\ndecide between the two draughts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 23d. At the President's. Present, Knox, Randolph, and Th:\r\nJefferson. Subject, the heads of the speech. One was, a proposition\r\nto Congress to fortify the principal harbors. I opposed the expediency\r\nof the General Government's undertaking it, and the expediency of the\r\nPresident's proposing it. It was amended, by substituting a proposition\r\nto adopt means for enforcing respect to the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates within its waters. It was proposed to recommend the establishment\r\nof a military academy. I objected that none of the specified powers\r\ngiven by the constitution to Congress, would authorize this. It was,\r\ntherefore, referred for further consideration and inquiry. Knox was for\r\nboth propositions. Randolph against the former, but said nothing as to\r\nthe latter. The President acknowledged he had doubted of the expediency\r\nof undertaking the former; and as to the latter, though it would be a\r\ngood thing, he did not wish to bring on anything which might generate\r\nheat and ill humor. It was agreed that Randolph should draw the speech\r\nand the messages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNovember the 28th. Met at the President's. I read over a list of the\r\npapers copying, to be communicated to Congress on the subject of Mr.\r\nGenet. It was agreed that Genet's letter of August the 13th to the\r\nPresident, mine of August the 16th, and Genet's of November to myself\r\nand the Attorney General, desiring a prosecution of Jay and King should\r\nnot be sent to the legislature: on a general opinion, that the discussion\r\nof the fact certified by Jay and King had better be left to the channel\r\nof the newspapers, and in the private hands in which it now is, than\r\nfor the President to meddle in it, or give room to a discussion of it\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nRandolph had prepared a draught of the speech. The clause recommending\r\nfortifications was left out; but that for a military academy was inserted.\r\nI opposed it, as unauthorized by the constitution. Hamilton and Knox\r\napproved it without discussion. Randolph was for it, saying that the\r\nwords of the constitution authorizing Congress to lay taxes, &c., _for\r\nthe common defence_, might comprehend it. The President said he would\r\nnot choose to recommend anything against the constitution, but if it\r\nwas _doubtful_, he was so impressed with the necessity of this measure,\r\nthat he would refer it to Congress, and let them decide for themselves\r\nwhether the constitution authorized it or not. It was, therefore, left\r\nin. I was happy to see that Randolph had, by accident, used the expression\r\n\"our republic,\" in the speech. The President, however, made no objection\r\nto it, and so, as much as it had disconcerted him on a former occasion\r\nwith me, it was now put into his own mouth to be pronounced to the two\r\nHouses of legislature.\r\n\r\nNo material alterations were proposed or made in any part of the draught.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I produced the draught of messages on the subject of France\r\nand England, proposing that that relative to Spain should be subsequent\r\nand secret.\r\n\r\nHamilton objected to the draught _in toto_; said that the contrast drawn\r\nbetween the conduct of France and England amounted to a declaration of\r\nwar; he denied that France had ever done us favors; that it was mean\r\nfor a nation to acknowledge favors; that the dispositions of the people\r\nof this country towards France, he considered as a serious calamity;\r\nthat the executive ought not, by an echo of this language, to nourish\r\nthat disposition in the people; that the offers in commerce made us\r\nby France, were the offspring of the moment, of circumstances which\r\nwould not last, and it was wrong to receive as permanent, things merely\r\ntemporary; that he could demonstrate that Great Britain showed us more\r\nfavors than France. In complaisance to him I whittled down the expressions\r\nwithout opposition; struck out that of \"favors ancient and recent\" from\r\nFrance; softened some terms, and omitted some sentiments respecting Great\r\nBritain. He still was against the whole, but insisted that, at any rate,\r\nit should be a secret communication, because the matters it stated were\r\nstill depending. These were, 1, the inexecution of the treaty; 2, the\r\nrestraining our commerce to their own ports and those of their friends.\r\nKnox joined Hamilton in everything. Randolph was for the communications;\r\nthat the documents respecting the first should be given in as public; but\r\nthat those respecting the second should not be given to the legislature\r\nat all, but kept secret. I began to tremble now for the whole, lest all\r\nshould be kept secret. I urged, especially, the duty now incumbent on\r\nthe President, to lay before the legislature and the public what had\r\npassed on the inexecution of the treaty, since Mr. Hammond's answer of\r\nthis month might be considered as the last we should ever have; that,\r\ntherefore, it could no longer be considered as a negotiation pending. I\r\nurged that the documents respecting the stopping our corn ought also to\r\ngo, but insisted that if it should be thought better to withhold them, the\r\nrestrictions should not go to those respecting the treaty; that neither\r\nof these subjects was more in a state of _pendency_ than the recall of\r\nMr. Genet, on which, nevertheless, no scruples had been expressed. The\r\nPresident took up the subject with more vehemence than I have seen him\r\nshow, and decided without reserve, that not only what had passed on the\r\ninexecution of the treaty should go in as public, (in which Hamilton\r\nand Knox had divided in opinion from Randolph and myself,) but also that\r\nthose respecting the stopping our corn should go in as public, (wherein,\r\nHamilton, Knox, and Randolph had been against me.) This was the first\r\ninstance I had seen of his deciding on the opinion of one against that\r\nof three others, which proved his own to have been very strong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 1st, 1793. Beckley tells me he had the following fact from\r\nLear. Langdon, Cabot, and some others of the Senate, standing in a knot\r\nbefore the fire after the Senate had adjourned, and growling together\r\nabout some measure which they had just lost; \"Ah!\" said Cabot, \"things\r\nwill never go right till you have a President for life, and an hereditary\r\nSenate.\" Langdon told this to Lear, who mentioned it to the President.\r\nThe President seemed struck with it, and declared he had not supposed\r\nthere was a man in the United States who could have entertained such an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 2d, 1797. I arrived at Philadelphia to qualify as\r\nVice-President, and called instantly on Mr. Adams, who lodged at\r\nFrancis's, in Fourth street. The next morning he returned my visit at Mr.\r\nMadison's, where I lodged. He found me alone in my room, and shutting the\r\ndoor himself, he said he was glad to find me alone, for that he wished\r\na free conversation with me. He entered immediately on an explanation\r\nof the situation of our affairs with France, and the danger of rupture\r\nwith that nation, a rupture which would convulse the attachments of\r\nthis country; that he was impressed with the necessity of an immediate\r\nmission to the Directory; that it would have been the first wish of\r\nhis heart to have got me to go there, but that he supposed it was out\r\nof the question, as it did not seem justifiable for him to send away\r\nthe person destined to take his place in case of accident to himself,\r\nnor decent to remove from competition one who was a rival in the public\r\nfavor. That he had, therefore, concluded to send a mission, which, by\r\nits dignity, should satisfy France, and by its selection from the three\r\ngreat divisions of the continent, should satisfy all parts of the United\r\nStates; in short, that he had determined to join Gerry and Madison to\r\nPinckney, and he wished me to consult Mr. Madison for him. I told him\r\nthat as to myself, I concurred in the opinion of the impropriety of my\r\nleaving the post assigned me, and that my inclinations, moreover, would\r\nnever permit me to cross the Atlantic again; that I would, as he desired,\r\nconsult Mr. Madison, but I feared it was desperate, as he had refused\r\nthat mission on my leaving it, in General Washington's time, though it\r\nwas kept open a twelvemonth for him. He said that if Mr. Madison should\r\nrefuse, he would still appoint him, and leave the responsibility on him.\r\nI consulted Mr. Madison, who declined as I expected. I think it was on\r\nMonday the 6th of March, Mr. Adams and myself met at dinner at General\r\nWashington's, and we happened, in the evening, to rise from table and\r\ncome away together. As soon as we got into the street, I told him the\r\nevent of my negotiation with Mr. Madison. He immediately said, that,\r\non consultation, some objections to that nomination had been raised\r\nwhich he had not contemplated; and was going on with excuses which\r\nevidently embarrassed him, when we came to Fifth street, where our road\r\nseparated, his being down Market street, mine off along Fifth, and we\r\ntook leave; and he never after that said one word to me on the subject,\r\nor ever consulted me as to any measures of the government. The opinion\r\nI formed at the time on this transaction, was, that Mr. Adams, in the\r\nfirst moments of the enthusiasm of the occasion, (his inauguration,)\r\nforgot party sentiments, and as he never acted on any system, but was\r\nalways governed by the feeling of the moment, he thought, for a moment,\r\nto steer impartially between the parties; that Monday, the 6th of March,\r\nbeing the first time he had met his cabinet, on expressing ideas of this\r\nkind, he had been at once diverted from them, and returned to his former\r\nparty views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly, 1797. Murray is rewarded for his services by an appointment to\r\nAmsterdam; W. Smith of Charleston, to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust the 24th. About the time of the British treaty, Hamilton and\r\nTalleyrand, bishop of Autun, dined together, and Hamilton drank freely.\r\nConversing on the treaty, Talleyrand says, \"mais vraiment Monsieur\r\nHamilton, ce n'est pas _bien honnete_, after making the Senate ratify\r\nthe treaty, to advise the President to reject it.\" \"The treaty,\" says\r\nHamilton, \"is an execrable one, and Jay was an old woman for making it;\r\nbut the whole credit of saving us from it must be given to the President.\"\r\nAfter circumstances had led to a conclusion that the President also must\r\nratify it, he said to the same Talleyrand, \"though the treaty is a most\r\nexecrable one, yet when once we have come to a determination on it, we\r\nmust carry it through thick and thin, right or wrong.\" Talleyrand told\r\nthis to Volney, who told it to me.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter now appearing in the papers, from Pickering to Monroe,\r\ndated July the 24th, 1797, which I am satisfied is written by Hamilton.\r\nHe was in Philadelphia at that date.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 26th, 1797. Langdon tells me, that at the second election\r\nof President and Vice-President of the United States, when there was a\r\nconsiderable vote given to Clinton in opposition to Mr. Adams, he took\r\noccasion to remark it in conversation in the Senate chamber with Mr.\r\nAdams, who, gritting his teeth, said, \"damn 'em, damn 'em, damn 'em, you\r\nsee that an elective government will not do.\" He also tells me that Mr.\r\nAdams, in a late conversation, said, \"republicanism must be disgraced,\r\nSir.\" The Chevalier Yruho called on him at Braintree, and conversing on\r\nFrench affairs, and Yruho expressing his belief of their stability, in\r\nopposition to Mr. Adams, the latter lifting up and shaking his finger\r\nat him, said, \"I'll tell you what, the French republic will not last\r\nthree months.\" This I had from Yruho.\r\n\r\nHarper, lately in a large company, was saying that the best thing the\r\nfriends of the French could do, was to pray for the restoration of\r\ntheir monarch. \"Then,\" says a bystander, \"the best thing we could do,\r\nI suppose, would be to pray for the establishment of a monarch in the\r\nUnited States.\" \"Our people,\" says Harper, \"are not yet ripe for it, but\r\nit is the best thing we can come to, and we shall come to it.\" Something\r\nlike this was said in presence of Findlay. He now denies it in the public\r\npapers, though it can be proved by several members.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 27th. Tenche Coxe tells me, that a little before Hamilton\r\nwent out of office, or just as he was going out, taking with him his\r\nlast conversation, and among other things, on the subject of their\r\ndifferences, \"for my part,\" says he, \"I avow myself a monarchist; I have\r\nno objection to a trial being made of this thing of a republic, but,\" &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 5th. 1798. I receive a very remarkable fact indeed in our\r\nhistory, from Baldwin and Skinner. Before the establishment of our present\r\ngovernment, a very extensive combination had taken place in New York and\r\nthe eastern States, among that description of people who were partly\r\nmonarchical in principle, or frightened with Shay's rebellion and the\r\nimpotence of the old Congress. Delegates in different places had actually\r\nhad consultations on the subject of seizing on the powers of a government,\r\nand establishing them by force; had corresponded with one another, and\r\nhad sent a deputy to General Washington to solicit his co-operation. He\r\nrefused to join them. The new convention was in the meantime proposed by\r\nVirginia and appointed. These people believed it impossible the States\r\nshould ever agree on a government, as this must include the impest and\r\nall the other powers which the States had, a thousand times, refused to\r\nthe general authority. They therefore let the proposed convention go on,\r\nnot doubting its failure, and confiding that on its failure would be a\r\nstill more favorable moment for their enterprise. They therefore wished\r\nit to fail, and especially, when Hamilton, their leader, brought forward\r\nhis plan of government, failed entirely in carrying it, and retired in\r\ndisgust from the convention. His associates then took every method to\r\nprevent any form of government being agreed to. But the well-intentioned\r\nnever ceased trying, first one thing, then another, till they could get\r\nsomething agreed to. The final passage and adoption of the constitution\r\ncompletely defeated the views of the combination, and saved us from an\r\nattempt to establish a government over us by force. This fact throws a\r\nblaze of light on the conduct of several members from New York and the\r\neastern States in the convention of Annapolis, and the grand convention.\r\nAt that of Annapolis, several eastern members most vehemently opposed\r\nMadison's proposition for a more general convention, with more general\r\npowers. They wished things to get more and more into confusion, to\r\njustify the violent measure they proposed. The idea of establishing a\r\ngovernment by reasoning and agreement, they publicly ridiculed as an\r\nUtopian project, visionary and unexampled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 6th, 1798. Mr. Baldwin tells me that in a conversation\r\nyesterday with Goodhue, on the state of our affairs, Goodhue said, \"I'll\r\ntell you what, I have made up my mind on this subject; I would rather the\r\nold ship should go down than not;\" (meaning the Union of the States.) Mr.\r\nHillhouse coming up, \"well,\" says Mr. Baldwin, \"I'll tell my old friend\r\nHillhouse what you say;\" and he told him. \"Well,\" says Goodhue, \"I repeat\r\nthat I would rather the old ship should go down, if we are to be always\r\nkept pumping so.\" \"Mr. Hillhouse,\" says Baldwin, \"you remember when we\r\nwere learning logic together at school, there was the case _categorical_\r\nand the case _hypothetical_. Mr. Goodhue stated it to me first as the\r\ncase categorical. I am glad to see that he now changes it to the case\r\nhypothetical, by adding, 'if we are always to be kept pumping so.'\"\r\nBaldwin went on then to remind Goodhue what an advocate he had been for\r\nour tonnage duty, wanting to make it one dollar instead of fifty cents;\r\nand how impatiently he bore the delays of Congress in proceeding to\r\nretaliate on Great Britain before Mr. Madison's propositions came on.\r\nGoodhue acknowledged that his opinions had changed since that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 15th, 1798. I dined this day with Mr. Adams, (the President.)\r\nThe company was large. After dinner I was sitting next to him, and our\r\nconversation was first on the enormous price of labor,[12] house rent,\r\nand other things. We both concurred in ascribing it chiefly to the floods\r\nof bank paper now afloat, and in condemning those institutions. We then\r\ngot on the constitution; and in the course of our conversation he said,\r\nthat no republic could ever last which had not a Senate, and a Senate\r\ndeeply and strongly rooted, strong enough to bear up against all popular\r\nstorms and passions; that he thought our Senate as well constituted\r\nas it could have been, being chosen by the legislatures; for if these\r\ncould not support them, he did not know what could do it; that perhaps\r\nit might have been as well for them to be chosen by the State at large,\r\nas that would insure a choice of distinguished men, since none but such\r\ncould be known to a whole people; that the only fault in our Senate\r\nwas, that it was not durable enough; that hitherto, it had behaved very\r\nwell; however, he was afraid they would give way in the end. That as to\r\ntrusting to a popular assembly for the preservation of our liberties, it\r\nwas the merest chimera imaginable; they never had any rule of decision\r\nbut their own will; that he would as lieve be again in the hands of our\r\nold committees of safety, who made the law and executed it at the same\r\ntime; that it had been observed by some writer, (I forget whom he named,)\r\nthat anarchy did more mischief in one night, than tyranny in an age; and\r\nthat in modern times we might say with truth, that in France, anarchy\r\nhad done more harm in one night, than all the despotism of their Kings\r\nhad ever done in twenty or thirty years. The point in which he views\r\nour Senate, as the colossus of the constitution, serves as a key to the\r\npolitics of the Senate, who are two-thirds of them in his sentiments,\r\nand accounts for the bold line of conduct they pursue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 1st. Mr. Tazewell tells me, that when the appropriations\r\nfor the British treaty were on the carpet, and very uncertain in the\r\nlower House, there being at that time a number of bills in the hands\r\nof committees of the Senate, none reported, and the Senate idle for\r\nwant of them, he, in his place, called on the committees to report, and\r\nparticularly on Mr. King, who was of most of them. King said that it\r\nwas true the committees kept back their reports, waiting the event of\r\nthe question about appropriation; that if that was not carried, they\r\nconsidered legislation as at an end; that they might as well break up\r\nand consider the Union as dissolved. Tazewell expressed his astonishment\r\nat these ideas, and called on King to know if he had misapprehended him.\r\nKing rose again and repeated the same words. The next day, Cabot took\r\nan occasion in debate, and so awkward a one as to show it was a thing\r\nagreed to be done, to repeat the same sentiments in stronger terms, and\r\ncarried further, by declaring a determination on their side to break up\r\nand dissolve the government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th. In conversation with Baldwin, and Brown of Kentucky,\r\nBrown says that in a private company once, consisting of Hamilton, King,\r\nMadison, himself, and some one else making a fifth, speaking of the\r\n\"_federal government_;\" \"Oh!\" says Hamilton, \"say the _federal monarchy_,\r\nlet us call things by their right names, for a monarchy it is.\"\r\n\r\nBaldwin mentions at table the following fact: When the bank bill was\r\nunder discussion in the House of Representatives, Judge Wilson came in,\r\nand was standing by Baldwin. Baldwin reminded him of the following fact\r\nwhich passed in the grand convention: Among the enumerated powers given\r\nto Congress, was one to erect corporations. It was, on debate, struck\r\nout. Several particular powers were then proposed. Among others, Robert\r\nMorris proposed to give Congress a power to establish a national bank.\r\nGouverneur Morris opposed it, observing that it was extremely doubtful\r\nwhether the constitution they were framing could ever be passed at all\r\nby the people of America; that to give it its best chance, however, they\r\nshould make it as palatable as possible, and put nothing into it not\r\nvery essential, which might raise up enemies; that his colleague (Robert\r\nMorris) well knew that \"a bank\" was, in their State, (Pennsylvania,)\r\nthe very watch-word of party; that _a bank_ had been the great bone of\r\ncontention between the two parties of the State from the establishment\r\nof their constitution, having been erected, put down, and erected again,\r\nas either party preponderated; that therefore, to insert this power,\r\nwould instantly enlist against the whole instrument, the whole of the\r\nanti-bank party in Pennsylvania. Whereupon it was rejected, as was every\r\nother special power, except that of giving copyrights to authors, and\r\npatents to inventors; the general power of incorporating being whittled\r\ndown to this shred. Wilson agreed to the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter, of South Carolina, who lodges with Rutledge,[13] tells me\r\nthat Rutledge was explaining to him the plan they proposed to pursue as\r\nto war measures when Otis came in. Rutledge addressed Otis. Now, sir,\r\nsays he, you must come forward with something liberal for the southern\r\nStates, fortify their harbors, and build gallies, in order to obtain\r\ntheir concurrence. Otis said, we insist on convoys for our European\r\ntrade, and _guarda costas_, on which condition alone we will give them\r\ngallies and fortifications. Rutledge observed, that in the event of war,\r\nMcHenry and Pickering must go out; Wolcott, he thought, might remain,\r\nbut the others were incapable of conducting a war. Otis said the eastern\r\npeople would never abandon Pickering, he must be retained; McHenry might\r\ngo. They considered together whether General Pinckney would accept the\r\noffice of Secretary of War. They apprehended he would not. It was agreed\r\nin this conversation that Sewall had more the ear of the President than\r\nany other person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th. When the bill for appropriations was before the\r\nSenate, Anderson moved to strike out a clause recognizing (by way\r\nof appropriation) the appointment of a committee by the House of\r\nRepresentatives to sit during their recess to collect evidence on Blount's\r\ncase, denying they had power, but by a law, to authorize a committee to\r\nsit during recess. Tracy advocated the motion, and said, \"We may as well\r\nspeak out. The committee was appointed by the House of Representatives to\r\ntake care of the British minister, to take care of the Spanish minister,\r\nto take care of the Secretary of State, in short, to take care of the\r\nPresident of the United States. They were afraid the President and\r\nSecretary of State would not perform the office of collecting evidence\r\nfaithfully; that there would be collusion, &c. Therefore, the House\r\nappointed a committee of their own. We shall have them next sending\r\na committee to Europe to make a treaty, &c. Suppose that the House of\r\nRepresentatives should resolve, that after the adjournment of Congress,\r\nthey should continue to sit as a committee of the whole House during\r\nthe whole recess.\" This shows how the appointment of that committee has\r\nbeen viewed by the President's friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 5th. Doctor Rush tells me he had it from Mrs. Adams, that not\r\na scrip of a pen has passed between the late and present President since\r\nhe came into office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 13th. New instructions of the British government to their\r\narmed ships now appear, which clearly infringe their treaty with us,\r\nby authorizing them to take our vessels carrying produce of the French\r\ncolonies from those colonies to Europe, and to take vessels bound to a\r\nblockaded port. See them in Brown's paper, of April the 18th, in due form.\r\n\r\nThe President has sent a government brig to France, probably to carry\r\ndespatches. He has chosen as the bearer of these one Humphreys, the son\r\nof a ship carpenter, ignorant, under age, not speaking a word of French,\r\nmost abusive of that nation, whose only merit is, the having mobbed and\r\nbeaten Bache on board the frigate built here, for which he was indicted\r\nand punished by fine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 25th. At a dinner given by the bar to the federal judges, Chase\r\nand Peters, present about twenty-four lawyers, and William Tilghman in\r\nthe chair, this toast was given, \"Our _King_ in old England.\" Observe\r\nthe double _entendre_ on the word King. Du Ponceau, who was one of the\r\nbar present, told this to Tenche Coxe, who told me in presence of H.\r\nTazewell. Dallas was at the dinner; so was Colonel Charles Sims, of\r\nAlexandria, who is here on a lawsuit _vs._ General Irving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay the 3d. The President some time ago appointed Steele, of Virginia, a\r\ncommissioner to the Indians, and recently Secretary of the Mississippi\r\nTerritory. Steele was a Counsellor of Virginia, and was voted out by\r\nthe Assembly because he turned tory. He then offered for Congress, and\r\nwas rejected by the people. Then offered for the Senate of Virginia,\r\nand was rejected. The President has also appointed Joseph Hopkinson\r\ncommissioner to make a treaty with the Oneida Indians. He is a youth\r\nof about twenty-two or twenty-three, and has no other claims to such\r\nan appointment than extreme toryism, and the having made a poor song to\r\nthe tune of the President's March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober the 13th, 1798.

In a conversation between Dr. Ewen and the President, the\r\nformer said one of his sons was an aristocrat, the other a democrat. The\r\nPresident asked if it was not the youngest who was the democrat. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid Ewen. \"Well,\" said the President, \"a boy of fifteen who is not a\r\ndemocrat is good for nothing, and he is no better who is a democrat at\r\ntwenty.\" Ewen told Hurt, and Hurt told me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 14th. Logan tells me that in his conversation with Pickering\r\non his arrival, the latter abused Gerry very much; said he was a traitor\r\nto his country, and had deserted the post to which he was appointed; that\r\nthe French temporized at first with Pinckney, but found him too much\r\nof a man for their purpose. Logan observing, that notwithstanding the\r\npacific declarations of France, it might still be well to keep up the\r\nmilitary ardor of our citizens, and to have the militia in good order;\r\n\"the militia,\" said Pickering, \"the militia never did any good to this\r\ncountry, except in the single affair of Bunker Hill; that we must have a\r\nstanding army of fifty thousand men, which being stationed in different\r\nparts of the continent, might serve as rallying points for the militia,\r\nand so render them of some service.\" In his conversation with Mr. Adams,\r\nLogan mentioned the willingness of the French to treat with Gerry. \"And\r\ndo you know why,\" said Mr. Adams. \"Why, sir?\" said Logan. \"Because,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Adams, \"they know him to have been an anti-federalist, against\r\nthe constitution.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2d, 1800. Information from Tenche Coxe. Mr. Liston had\r\nsent two letters to the Governor of Canada by one Sweezy. He had sent\r\ncopies of them, together with a third (original) by one Cribs. Sweezy\r\nwas arrested (being an old horse thief), and his papers examined. T.\r\nCoxe had a sight of them. As soon as a rumor got out that there were\r\nletters of Mr. Liston disclosed, but no particulars yet mentioned, Mr.\r\nListon suspecting that _Cribs_ had betrayed him, thought it best to\r\nbring all his _three_ letters, and lay them before Pickering, Secretary\r\nof State. Pickering thought them all very innocent. In his office they\r\nwere seen by a Mr. Hodgen of New Jersey, commissary of military stores,\r\nand the intimate friend of Pickering. It happens that there is some land\r\npartnership between Pickering, Hodgen and Coxe, so that the latter is\r\nfreely and intimately visited by Hodgen, who, moreover, speaks freely\r\nwith him on political subjects. They were talking the news of the day,\r\nwhen Mr. Coxe observed that these intercepted letters of Liston were\r\nserious things; (nothing being yet out but a general rumor.) Hodgen\r\nasked which he thought the most serious. Coxe said the second; (for he\r\nknew yet of no other.) Hodgen said he thought little of any of them,\r\nbut that the third was the most exceptionable. This struck Coxe, who,\r\nnot betraying his ignorance of a third letter, asked generally what\r\npart of that he alluded to. Hodgen said to that wherein he _assured the\r\nGovernor of Canada, that if the French invaded Canada, an army would\r\nbe marched from these States to his assistance_. After this it became\r\nknown that it was Sweezy who was arrested, and not Cribs; so that Mr.\r\nListon had made an unnecessary disclosure of his third letter to Mr.\r\nPickering, who, however, keeps his secret for him. In the beginning of\r\nthe conversation between Hodgen and Coxe, Coxe happened to name Sweezy\r\nas the bearer of the letters. \"That's not his name,\" says Hodgen (for\r\nhe did not know that two of the letters had been sent by Sweezy also),\r\n\"his name is Cribs.\" This put Coxe on his guard, and sent him fishing\r\nfor the new matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 10th. Doctor Rush tells me that he had it from Samuel Lyman,\r\nthat during the X Y Z Congress, the federal members held the largest\r\ncaucus they have ever had, at which he was present, and the question was\r\nproposed and debated, whether they should declare war against France,\r\nand determined in the negative. Lyman was against it.\r\n\r\nHe tells me, that Mr. Adams told him, that when he came on in the fall to\r\nTrenton, he was there surrounded constantly by the opponents of the late\r\nmission to France. That Hamilton pressing him to delay it, said, \"Why,\r\nsir, by Christmas, Louis the XVIII. will be seated on his throne.\" Mr.\r\nA. \"By whom?\" H. \"By the coalition.\" Mr. A. \"Ah! then farewell to the\r\nindependence of Europe. If a coalition moved by the finger of England,\r\nis to give a government to France, there is an end to the independence\r\nof every country.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 12th. General Samuel Smith says that Pickering, Wolcott,\r\nand McHenry, wrote a joint letter from Trenton to the President, then at\r\nBraintree, dissuading him from the mission to France. Stoddard refused\r\nto join in it. Stoddard says the instructions are such, that if the\r\nDirectory have any disposition to reconciliation, a treaty will be made.\r\nHe observed to him, also, that Ellsworth looks beyond this mission to\r\nthe Presidential chair. That with this view, he will endeavor to make\r\na treaty, and a good one. That Davie has the same vanity and views. All\r\nthis communicated by Stoddard to S. Smith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 13th. Baer and Harrison G. Otis told J. Nicholas, that in\r\nthe caucus mentioned ante 10th, there wanted but five votes to produce\r\na declaration of war. Baer was against it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 19th. W. C. Nicholas tells me, that in a conversation with\r\nDexter three or four days ago, he asked Dexter whether it would not be\r\npracticable for the States to agree on some uniform mode of choosing\r\nelectors of President. Dexter said, \"I suppose you would prefer an\r\nelection by districts.\" \"Yes,\" said Nicholas, \"I think it would be\r\nbest; but would nevertheless agree to any other consistent with the\r\nconstitution.\" Dexter said he did not know what might be the opinion of\r\nhis State, but his own was, that no mode of _election_ would answer any\r\ngood purpose; that he should prefer one _for life_. \"On that reasoning,\"\r\nsaid Nicholas, \"you should prefer an hereditary one.\" \"No,\" he said,\r\n\"we are not ripe for that yet. I suppose,\" added he, \"this doctrine is\r\nnot very popular with you.\" \"No,\" said Nicholas, \"it would effectually\r\ndamn any man in my State.\" \"So it would in mine,\" said Dexter; \"but\r\nI am under no inducement to belie my sentiment, I have nothing to ask\r\nfrom anybody; I had rather be at home than here, therefore I speak my\r\nsentiments freely.\" Mr. Nicholas, a little before or after this, made\r\nthe same proposition of a uniform election to Ross, who replied that he\r\nsaw no good in any kind of election. \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"the present\r\none may last awhile.\" On the whole, Mr. Nicholas thinks he perceives in\r\nthat party, a willingness and a wish to let everything go from bad to\r\nworse, to amend nothing, in hopes it may bring on confusion, and open a\r\ndoor to the kind of government they wish. In a conversation with Gunn,\r\nwho goes with them, but thinks in some degree with us, Gunn told him\r\nthat the very game which the minority of Pennsylvania is now playing with\r\nMcKean, (see substitute of minority in lower House, and address of Senate\r\nin upper,) was meditated by the same party in the federal government,\r\nin case of the election of a republican President; and that the eastern\r\nStates would in that case throw things into confusion, and break the\r\nUnion. That they have in a great degree got rid of their paper, so as no\r\nlonger to be creditors, and the moment they cease to enjoy the plunder\r\nof the immense appropriations now exclusively theirs, they would aim at\r\nsome other order of things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 24th. Mr. Smith, a merchant of Hamburg, gives me the following\r\ninformation: The St. Andrew's Club of New York, (all of Scotch tories,)\r\ngave a public dinner lately. Among other guests, Alexander Hamilton was\r\none. After dinner, the first toast was, \"The President of the United\r\nStates.\" It was drank without any particular approbation. The next\r\nwas, \"George the Third.\" Hamilton started up on his feet, and insisted\r\non a bumper and three cheers. The whole company accordingly rose and\r\ngave the cheers. One of them, though a federalist, was so disgusted\r\nat the partiality shown by Hamilton to a foreign sovereign over his\r\nown President, that he mentioned it to a Mr. Schwarthouse, an American\r\nmerchant of New York, who mentioned it to Smith.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith also tells me, that calling one evening on Mr. Evans, then\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania, and asking\r\nthe news, Evans said, Harper had been just there, and speaking of the\r\nPresident's setting out to Braintree, said, \"he prayed to God that his\r\nhorses might run away with him, or some other accident happen to break\r\nhis neck before he reached Braintree.\" This was indignation at his having\r\nnamed Murray, &c., to negotiate with France. Evans approved of the wish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 1st. Doctor Rush tells me that he had it from Asa Green,\r\nthat when the clergy addressed General Washington on his departure from\r\nthe government, it was observed in their consultation, that he had never,\r\non any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the\r\nChristian religion, and they thought they should so pen their address,\r\nas to force him at length to declare publicly whether he was a Christian\r\nor not. They did so. However, he observed, the old fox was too cunning\r\nfor them. He answered every article of their address particularly except\r\nthat, which he passed over without notice. Rush observes, he never did\r\nsay a word on the subject in any of his public papers, except in his\r\nvaledictory letter to the Governors of the States, when he resigned his\r\ncommission in the army, wherein he speaks of \"the benign influence of\r\nthe Christian religion.\"\r\n\r\nI know that Gouverneur Morris, who pretended to be in his secrets and\r\nbelieved himself to be so, has often told me that General Washington\r\nbelieved no more of that system than he himself did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch, 1800. Heretical doctrines maintained in Senate, on the motion\r\nagainst the Aurora. That there is in every legal body of men a right of\r\nself-preservation, authorizing them to do whatever is necessary for that\r\npurpose: by Tracy, Read, and Lawrence. That the common law authorizes\r\nthe proceeding proposed against the Aurora, and is in force here: by\r\nRead. That the privileges of Congress are and ought to be indefinite:\r\nby Read.\r\n\r\nTracy says, he would not say exactly that the common law of England in\r\nall its extent is in force here; but common sense, reason and morality,\r\nwhich are the foundations of the common law, are in force here, and\r\nestablish a common law. He held himself so nearly half way between the\r\ncommon law of England and what everybody else has called natural law,\r\nand not common law, that he could hold to either the one or the other,\r\nas he should find expedient.\r\n\r\nDexter maintained that the common law, as to crimes, is in force in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nChipman says, that the principles of common right are common law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th. Conversing with Mrs. Adams on the subject of the writers\r\nin the newspapers, I took occasion to mention that I never in my life\r\nhad, directly or indirectly, written one sentence for a newspaper; which\r\nis an absolute truth. She said that Mr. Adams, she believed, had pretty\r\nwell ceased to meddle in the newspapers, since he closed the pieces on\r\nDavila. This is the first direct avowal of that work to be his, though\r\nlong and universally understood to be so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 14th. Freneau, in Charleston, had the printing of the laws\r\nin his paper. He printed a pamphlet of Pinckney's letters on Robbins'\r\ncase. Pickering has given the printing of the laws to the tory paper of\r\nthat place, though not of half the circulation. The printing amounted\r\nto about one hundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 24th. Mr. Perez Morton of Massachusetts tells me that Thatcher,\r\non his return from the war Congress, declared to him he had been for a\r\ndeclaration of war against France, and many others also; but that on\r\ncounting noses they found they could not carry it, and therefore did\r\nnot attempt it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 27th. Judge Breckenridge gives me the following information:\r\nHe and Mr. Ross were originally very intimate; indeed, he says, he found\r\nhim keeping a little Latin school, and advised and aided him in the\r\nstudy of law, and brought him forward. After Ross became a Senator, and\r\nparticularly at the time of the western insurrection, they still were in\r\nconcert. After the British treaty, Ross, on his return, informed him there\r\nwas a party in the United States who wanted to overturn the government,\r\nwho were in league with France; that France, by a secret article of treaty\r\nwith Spain was to have Louisiana; and that Great Britain was likely to be\r\nour best friend and dependence. On this information, he, Breckenridge,\r\nwas induced to become an advocate for the British treaty. During this\r\nintimacy with Ross, he says, that General Collot, in his journey to the\r\nwestern country, called on him, and he frequently led Breckenridge into\r\nconversations on their grievances under the government, and particularly\r\nthe western expedition; that he spoke to him of the advantages that\r\ncountry would have in joining France when she should hold Louisiana;\r\nshowed him a map he had drawn of that part of the country; pointed out\r\nthe passes in the mountain, and the facility with which they might hold\r\nthem against the United States, and with which France could support\r\nthem from New Orleans. He says, that in these conversations, Collot let\r\nhimself out with common prudence. He says, Michaud, (to whom I, at the\r\nrequest of Genet, had given a letter of introduction to the Governor of\r\nKentucky as a botanist, which was his real profession,) called on him;\r\nthat Michaud had a commissary's commission for the expedition, which\r\nGenet had planned from that quarter against the Spaniards; that ----, the\r\nlate Spanish commandant of St. Genevieve, with one Powers, an Englishman,\r\ncalled on him. That from all these circumstances, together with Ross'\r\nstories, he did believe that there was a conspiracy to deliver our\r\ncountry, or some part of it at least, to the French; that he made notes\r\nof what passed between himself and Collot and the others, and lent them\r\nto Mr. Ross, who gave them to the President, by whom they were deposited\r\nin the office of the Board of War; that when he complained to Ross of\r\nthis breach of confidence, he endeavored to get off by compliments on\r\nthe utility and importance of his notes. They now cooled towards each\r\nother; and his opposition to Ross's election as Governor has separated\r\nthem in truth, though not entirely to appearance.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rush tells me, that within a few days he has heard a member\r\nof Congress lament our separation from Great Britain, and express his\r\nsincere wishes that we were again dependent on her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 25th, 1800. Colonel Hitchburn tells me what Col. Monroe\r\nhad before told me of, as coming from Hitchburn. He was giving me the\r\ncharacters of persons in Massachusetts. Speaking of Lowell, he said he\r\nwas, in the beginning of the Revolution, a timid whig, but as soon as he\r\nfound we were likely to prevail, he became a great office hunter. And\r\nin the very breath of speaking of Lowell, he stopped: says he, I will\r\ngive you a piece of information which I do not venture to speak of to\r\nothers. There was a Mr. Hale in Massachusetts, a reputable, worthy man,\r\nwho becoming a little embarrassed in his affairs, I aided him, which\r\nmade him very friendly to me. He went to Canada on some business. The\r\nGovernor there took great notice of him. On his return, he took occasion\r\nto mention to me that he was authorized by the Governor of Canada to give\r\nfrom three to five thousand guineas each to himself and some others,\r\nto induce them, not to do anything to the injury of their country, but\r\nto befriend a good connection between England and it. Hitchburn said he\r\nwould think of it, and asked Hale to come and dine with him to-morrow.\r\nAfter dinner he drew Hale fully out. He told him he had his doubts, but\r\nparticularly, that he should not like to be alone in such a business. On\r\nthat, Hale named to him four others who were to be engaged, two of whom,\r\nsaid Hitchburn, are now dead, and two living. Hitchburn, when he had got\r\nall he wanted out of Hale, declined in a friendly way. But he observed\r\nthose four men, from that moment, to espouse the interests of England\r\nin every point and on every occasion. Though he did not name the men\r\nto me, yet as the speaking of Lowell was what brought into his head to\r\ntell me this anecdote, I concluded he was one. From other circumstances\r\nrespecting Stephen Higginson, of whom he spoke, I conjectured him to be\r\nthe other living one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 26th. In another conversation, I mentioned to Colonel\r\nHitchburn, that though he had not named names, I had strongly suspected\r\nHigginson to be one of Hale's men. He smiled and said, if I had strongly\r\nsuspected any man wrongfully from his information, he would undeceive\r\nme; that there were no persons he thought more strongly to be suspected\r\nhimself, than Higginson and Lowell. I considered this as saying they\r\nwere the men. Higginson is employed in an important business about our\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 12th, 1801. Edward Livingston tells me, that Bayard applied\r\nto-day or last night to General Samuel Smith, and represented to him\r\nthe expediency of his coming over to the States who vote for Burr, that\r\nthere was nothing in the way of appointment which he might not command,\r\nand particularly mentioned the Secretaryship of the Navy. Smith asked\r\nhim if he was authorized to make the offer. He said he was authorized.\r\nSmith told this to Livingston, and to W. C. Nicholas who confirms it\r\nto me. Bayard in like manner tempted Livingston, not by offering any\r\nparticular office, but by representing to him his, Livingston's, intimacy\r\nand connection with Burr; that from him he had everything to expect, if he\r\nwould come over to him. To Doctor Linn of New Jersey, they have offered\r\nthe government of New Jersey. See a paragraph in Martin's Baltimore\r\npaper of February the 10th, signed, \"A LOOKER ON,\" stating an intimacy\r\nof views between Harper and Burr.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 14th. General Armstrong tells me, that Gouverneur Morris,\r\nin conversation with him to-day on the scene which is passing, expressed\r\nhimself thus. \"How comes it,\" says he, \"that Burr who is four hundred\r\nmiles off, (at Albany,) has agents here at work with great activity,\r\nwhile Mr. Jefferson, who is on the spot, does nothing?\" This explains\r\nthe ambiguous conduct of himself and his nephew, Lewis Morris, and that\r\nthey were holding themselves free for a prize; _i. e._, some office,\r\neither to the uncle or nephew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFebruary the 16th.

Andrew Ellicot tells me, that in a conversation\r\nlast summer with Major William Jackson of Philadelphia, on the subject\r\nof our intercourse with Spain, Jackson said we had managed our affairs\r\nbadly; that he himself was the author of the papers against the Spanish\r\nministers signed Americanus; that his object was irritation; that he\r\nwas anxious, if it could have been brought about, to have plunged us in\r\na war with Spain, that the people might have been occupied with that,\r\nand not with the conduct of the administration, and other things they\r\nhad no business to meddle with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 13th, 1803. The Reverend Mr. Coffin of New England, who\r\nis now here soliciting donations for a college in Greene county, in\r\nTennessee, tells me that when he first determined to engage in this\r\nenterprise, he wrote a paper recommendatory of the enterprise, which\r\nhe meant to get signed by clergymen, and a similar one for persons in\r\na civil character, at the head of which he wished Mr. Adams to put his\r\nname, he being then President, and the application going only for his\r\nname, and not for a donation. Mr. Adams, after reading the paper and\r\nconsidering, said, \"he saw no possibility of continuing the union of\r\nthe States; that their dissolution must necessarily take place; that he\r\ntherefore saw no propriety in recommending to New England men to promote\r\na literary institution in the south; that it was in fact giving strength\r\nto those who were to be their enemies; and, therefore, he would have\r\nnothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember the 31st. After dinner to-day, the pamphlet on the conduct of\r\nColonel Burr being the subject of conversation, Matthew Lyon noticed\r\nthe insinuations against the republicans at Washington, pending the\r\nPresidential election, and expressed his wish that everything was spoken\r\nout which was known; that it would then appear on which side there was\r\na bidding for votes, and he declared that John Brown of Rhode Island,\r\nurging him to vote for Colonel Burr, used these words: \"What is it you\r\nwant, Colonel Lyon? Is it office, is it money? Only say what you want,\r\nand you shall have it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2d, 1804. Colonel Hitchburn of Massachusetts, reminding me\r\nof a letter he had written me from Philadelphia, pending the Presidential\r\nelection, says he did not therein give the details. That he was in company\r\nat Philadelphia with Colonel Burr and * * * * * that in the course of\r\nthe conversation on the election, Colonel Burr said, \"we must have a\r\nPresident, and a constitutional one, in some way.\" \"How is it to be\r\ndone,\" says Hitchburn; \"Mr. Jefferson's friends will not quit him, and\r\nhis enemies are not strong enough to carry another.\" \"Why,\" says Burr,\r\n\"our friends must join the federalists, and give the President.\" The next\r\nmorning at breakfast, Colonel Burr repeated nearly the same, saying, \"we\r\ncannot be without a President, our friends must join the federal vote.\"\r\n\"But,\" says Hitchburn, \"we shall then be without a Vice-President; who\r\nis to be our Vice-President?\" Colonel Burr answered, \"Mr. Jefferson.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary the 26th. Colonel Burr, the Vice-President, calls on me in the\r\nevening, having previously asked an opportunity of conversing with me.\r\nHe began by recapitulating summarily, that he had come to New York a\r\nstranger, some years ago; that he found the country in possession of two\r\nrich families (the Livingstons and Clintons); that his pursuits were not\r\npolitical, and he meddled not. When the crisis, however, of 1800 came\r\non, they found their influence worn out, and solicited his aid with the\r\npeople. He lent it without any views of promotion. That his being named\r\nas a candidate for Vice-President was unexpected by him. He acceded to\r\nit with a view to promote my fame and advancement, and from a desire to\r\nbe with me, whose company and conversation had always been fascinating\r\nto him. That since, those great families had become hostile to him,\r\nand had excited the calumnies which I had seen published. That in this\r\nHamilton had joined, and had even written some of the pieces against him.\r\nThat his attachment to me had been sincere, and was still unchanged,\r\nalthough many little stories had been carried to him, and he supposed\r\nto me also, which he despised; but that attachments must be reciprocal\r\nor cease to exist, and therefore he asked if any change had taken place\r\nin mine towards him; that he had chosen to have this conversation with\r\nmyself directly, and not through any intermediate agent. He reminded me\r\nof a letter written to him about the time of counting the votes, (say\r\nFebruary, 1801,) mentioning that his election had left a chasm in my\r\narrangements; that I had lost him from my list in the administration, &c.\r\nHe observed, he believed it would be for the interest of the republican\r\ncause for him to retire; that a disadvantageous schism would otherwise\r\ntake place; but that were he to retire, it would be said he shrunk from\r\nthe public sentence, which he never would do; that his enemies were using\r\nmy name to destroy him, and something was necessary from me to prevent\r\nand deprive them of that weapon, some mark of favor from me which would\r\ndeclare to the world that he retired with my confidence.\r\n\r\nI answered by recapitulating to him what had been my conduct previous\r\nto the election of 1800. That I had never interfered directly or\r\nindirectly with my friends or any others, to influence the election\r\neither for him or myself; that I considered it as my duty to be merely\r\npassive, except that in Virginia, I had taken some measures to procure\r\nfor him the unanimous vote of that State, because I thought any failure\r\nthere might be imputed to me. That in the election now coming on, I was\r\nobserving the same conduct, held no councils with anybody respecting\r\nit, nor suffered any one to speak to me on the subject, believing it my\r\nduty to leave myself to the free discussion of the public; that I do\r\nnot at this moment know, nor have ever heard, who were to be proposed\r\nas candidates for the public choice, except so far as could be gathered\r\nfrom the newspapers. That as to the attack excited against him in the\r\nnewspapers, I had noticed it but as the passing wind; that I had seen\r\ncomplaints that Cheetham, employed in publishing the laws, should be\r\npermitted to eat the public bread and abuse its second officer; that as\r\nto this, the publishers of the laws were appointed by the Secretary of\r\nthe State, without any reference to me; that to make the notice general,\r\nit was often given to one republican and one federal printer of the\r\nsame place; that these federal printers did not in the least intermit\r\ntheir abuse of me, though receiving emoluments from the governments\r\nand that I have never thought it proper to interfere for myself, and\r\nconsequently not in the case of the Vice-President. That as to the letter\r\nhe referred to, I remembered it, and believed he had only mistaken the\r\ndate at which it was written; that I thought it must have been on the\r\nfirst notice of the event of the election of South Carolina; and that I\r\nhad taken that occasion to mention to him, that I had intended to have\r\nproposed to him one of the great offices, if he had not been elected;\r\nbut that his election in giving him a higher station had deprived me\r\nof his aid in the administration. The letter alluded to was, in fact,\r\nmine to him of December the 15th, 1800. I now went on to explain to him\r\nverbally, what I meant by saying I had lost him from my list. That in\r\nGeneral Washington's time, it had been signified to him that Mr. Adams,\r\nthe Vice-President, would be glad of a foreign embassy; that General\r\nWashington mentioned it to me, expressed his doubts whether Mr. Adams was\r\na fit character for such an office, and his still greater doubts, indeed\r\nhis conviction, that it would not be justifiable to send away the person\r\nwho, in case of his death, was provided by the constitution to take his\r\nplace; that it would moreover appear indecent for him to be disposing of\r\nthe public trusts, in apparently buying off a competitor for the public\r\nfavor. I concurred with him in the opinion, and, if I recollect rightly,\r\nHamilton, Knox, and Randolph were consulted and gave the same opinions.\r\nThat when Mr. Adams came to the administration, in his first interview\r\nwith me, he mentioned the necessity of a mission to France, and how\r\ndesirable it would have been to him if he could have got me to undertake\r\nit; but that he conceived it would be wrong in him to send me away, and\r\nassigned the same reasons General Washington had done; and therefore,\r\nhe should appoint Mr. Madison, &c. That I had myself contemplated his\r\n(Colonel Burr's) appointment to one of the great offices, in case he\r\nwas not elected Vice-President; but that as soon as that election was\r\nknown, I saw it could not be done, for the good reasons which had led\r\nGeneral Washington and Mr. Adams to the same conclusion; and therefore,\r\nin my first letter to Colonel Burr, after the issue was known, I had\r\nmentioned to him that a chasm in my arrangements had been produced by\r\nthis event. I was thus particular in rectifying the date of this letter,\r\nbecause it gave me an opportunity of explaining the grounds on which\r\nit was written, which were, indirectly, an answer to his present hints.\r\nHe left the matter with me for consideration, and the conversation was\r\nturned to indifferent subjects. I should here notice, that Colonel Burr\r\nmust have thought that I could swallow strong things in my own favor,\r\nwhen he founded his acquiescence in the nomination as Vice-President, to\r\nhis desire of promoting my honor, the being with me, whose company and\r\nconversation had always been fascinating with him, &c. I had never seen\r\nColonel Burr till he came as a member of Senate. His conduct very soon\r\ninspired me with distrust. I habitually cautioned Mr. Madison against\r\ntrusting him too much. I saw afterwards, that under General Washington's\r\nand Mr. Adams' administrations, whenever a great military appointment\r\nor a diplomatic one was to be made, he came post to Philadelphia to\r\nshow himself, and in fact that he was always at market, if they had\r\nwanted him. He was indeed told by Dayton in 1800, he might be Secretary\r\nat War; but this bid was too late. His election as Vice-President was\r\nthen foreseen. With these impressions of Colonel Burr, there never had\r\nbeen an intimacy between us, and but little association. When I destined\r\nhim for a high appointment, it was out of respect for the favor he had\r\nobtained with the republican party, by his extraordinary exertions and\r\nsuccesses in the New York election in 1800.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApril the 15th, 1806. About a month ago, Colonel Burr called on me, and\r\nentered into a conversation, in which he mentioned, that a little before\r\nmy coming into office, I had written to him a letter intimating that I\r\nhad destined him for a high employ, had he not been placed by the people\r\nin a different one; that he had signified his willingness to resign as\r\nVice-President, to give aid to the administration in any other place,\r\nthat he had never asked an office, however; he asked aid of nobody, but\r\ncould walk on his own legs and take care of himself; that I had always\r\nused him with politeness, but nothing more; that he aided in bringing on\r\nthe present order of things; that he had supported the administration;\r\nand that he could do me much harm; he wished, however, to be on different\r\nground; he was now disengaged from all particular business--willing\r\nto engage in something--should be in town some days, if I should have\r\nanything to propose to him. I observed to him, that I had always been\r\nsensible that he possessed talents which might be employed greatly to\r\nthe advantage of the public, and that as to myself, I had a confidence\r\nthat if he were employed, he would use his talents for the public good;\r\nbut that he must be sensible the public had withdrawn their confidence\r\nfrom him, and that in a government like ours it was necessary to embrace\r\nin its administration as great a mass of public confidence as possible,\r\nby employing those who had a character with the public, of their own,\r\nand not merely a secondary one through the executive. He observed, that\r\nif we believed a few newspapers, it might be supposed he had lost the\r\npublic confidence, but that I knew how easy it was to engage newspapers\r\nin anything. I observed, that I did not refer to that kind of evidence\r\nof his having lost the public confidence, but to the late Presidential\r\nelection, when, though in possession of the office of Vice-President,\r\nthere was not a single voice heard for his retaining it. That as to any\r\nharm he could do me, I knew no cause why he should desire it, but, at the\r\nsame time, I feared no injury which any man could do me; that I never\r\nhad done a single act, or been concerned in any transaction, which I\r\nfeared to have fully laid open, or which could do me any hurt, if truly\r\nstated; that I had never done a single thing with a view to my personal\r\ninterest, or that of any friend, or with any other view than that of the\r\ngreatest public good; that, therefore, no threat or fear on that head\r\nwould ever be a motive of action with me. He has continued in town to\r\nthis time; dined with me this day week, and called on me to take leave\r\ntwo or three days ago.\r\n\r\nI did not commit these things to writing at the time, but I do it now,\r\nbecause in a suit between him and Cheetham, he has had a deposition of\r\nMr. Bayard taken, which seems to have no relation to the suit, nor to any\r\nother object than to calumniate me. Bayard pretends to have addressed to\r\nme, during the pending of the Presidential election in February, 1801,\r\nthrough General Samuel Smith, certain conditions on which my election\r\nmight be obtained, and that General Smith, after conversing with me, gave\r\nanswers from me. This is absolutely false. No proposition of any kind\r\nwas ever made to me on that occasion by General Smith, nor any answer\r\nauthorized by me. And this fact General Smith affirms at this moment.\r\n\r\nFor some matters connected with this, see my notes of February the 12th\r\nand 14th, 1801, made at the moment. But the following transactions took\r\nplace about the same time, that is to say, while the Presidential election\r\nwas in suspense in Congress, which, though I did not enter at the time,\r\nthey made such an impression on my mind, that they are now as fresh,\r\nas to their principal circumstances, as if they had happened yesterday.\r\nComing out of the Senate chamber one day, I found Gouverneur Morris on\r\nthe steps. He stopped me, and began a conversation on the strange and\r\nportentous state of things then existing, and went on to observe, that the\r\nreasons why the minority of States was so opposed to my being elected,\r\nwere, that they apprehended that, 1, I would turn all federalists out\r\nof office; 2, put down the navy; 3, wipe off the public debt. That I\r\nneed only to declare, or authorize my friends to declare, that I would\r\nnot take these steps, and instantly the event of the election would be\r\nfixed. I told him, that I should leave the world to judge of the course\r\nI meant to pursue by that which I had pursued hitherto, believing it\r\nto be my duty to be passive and silent during the present scene; that\r\nI should certainly make no terms; should never go into the office of\r\nPresident by capitulation, nor with my hands tied by any conditions which\r\nshould hinder me from pursuing the measures which I should deem for the\r\npublic good. It was understood that Gouverneur Morris had entirely the\r\ndirection of the vote of Lewis Morris of Vermont, who, by coming over to\r\nMatthew Lyon, would have added another vote, and decided the election.\r\nAbout the same time, I called on Mr. Adams. We conversed on the state of\r\nthings. I observed to him, that a very dangerous experiment was then in\r\ncontemplation, to defeat the Presidential election by an act of Congress\r\ndeclaring the right of the Senate to name a President of the Senate,\r\nto devolve on him the government during any interregnum; that such a\r\nmeasure would probably produce resistance by force, and incalculable\r\nconsequences, which it would be in his power to prevent by negativing\r\nsuch an act. He seemed to think such an act justifiable, and observed,\r\nit was in my power to fix the election by a word in an instant, by\r\ndeclaring I would not turn out the federal officers, nor put down the\r\nnavy, nor spunge the national debt. Finding his mind made up as to the\r\nusurpation of the government by the President of the Senate, I urged it\r\nno further, observed the world must judge as to myself of the future by\r\nthe past, and turned the conversation to something else. About the same\r\ntime, Dwight Foster of Massachusetts called on me in my room one night,\r\nand went into a very long conversation on the state of affairs, the\r\ndrift of which was to let me understand, that the fears above mentioned\r\nwere the only obstacle to my election, to all of which I avoided giving\r\nany answer the one way or the other. From this moment he became most\r\nbitterly and personally opposed to me, and so has ever continued. I do\r\nnot recollect that I ever had any particular conversation with General\r\nSamuel Smith on this subject. Very possibly I had, however, as the general\r\nsubject and all its parts were the constant themes of conversation in\r\nthe private _tête à têtes_ with our friends. But certain I am, that\r\nneither he nor any other republican ever uttered the most distant hint\r\nto me about submitting to any conditions, or giving any assurances to\r\nanybody; and still more certainly, was neither he nor any other person\r\never authorized by me to say what I would or would not do. * * * * *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [6] [These are the volumes containing the celebrated\r\n     Anas, up to the time of the author's retirement from the\r\n     Secretaryship of State.

Late in life, \"when\r\n     the passions of the times had passed away,\" he carefully\r\n     revised them for publication. \"At this day,\" he says,\r\n     \"after the lapse of twenty-five years, or more, from their\r\n     dates, I have given to the whole a calm revisal, when the\r\n     passions of the times are passed away, and the reasons\r\n     of the transactions act alone upon the judgment. Some of\r\n     the informations I had recorded, are now cut out from the\r\n     rest, because I have seen that they were incorrect, or\r\n     doubtful, or merely personal or private, with which we\r\n     have nothing to do. I should, perhaps, not have thought the\r\n     rest worth preserving, but for their testimony against the\r\n     only history of that period, which pretends to have been\r\n     compiled from authentic and unpublished documents.\" Under\r\n     these circumstances, the Editor has not felt himself at\r\n     liberty to exclude the Anas from a publication professing\r\n     to be a complete edition of the writings of Jefferson.\r\n     They are accordingly inserted just in the form in which\r\n     he left them after his last revisal.--ED.]\r\n\r\n     [7] [The opinions here alluded to will be found\r\n     in Book III., devoted to Official Papers.--ED.]\r\n\r\n     [8] See conversation with General Washington,\r\n     October 1, 1792.\r\n\r\n     [9] There had been a previous consultation at\r\n     the President's (about the first week in November) on the\r\n     expediency of suspending payments to France, under her\r\n     present situation. I had admitted that the late constitution\r\n     was dissolved by the dethronement of the King; and the\r\n     management of affairs surviving to the National Assembly\r\n     only, this was not an integral Legislature, and therefore not\r\n     competent to give a legitimate discharge for our payments:\r\n     that I thought, consequently, that none should be made till\r\n     some legitimate body came into place; and that I should\r\n     consider the National Convention called, but not met as we\r\n     had yet heard, to be a legitimate body. Hamilton doubted\r\n     whether it would be a legitimate body, and whether, if\r\n     the King should be re-established, he might not disallow\r\n     such payments on good grounds. Knox, for once, dared to\r\n     differ from Hamilton, and to express, very submissively,\r\n     an opinion, that a convention named by the whole body of\r\n     the nation, would be competent to do anything. It ended\r\n     by agreeing, that I should write to Gouverneur Morris to\r\n     suspend payment generally till further orders.\r\n\r\n     [10] [In the margin is written, by Mr. Jefferson,\r\n     \"Impossible as to Hamilton he was far above that.\"]\r\n\r\n     [11] He said that Mr. Morris, taking a family\r\n     dinner with him the other day, went largely, and of his\r\n     own accord, into this subject; advised this appeal, and\r\n     promised, if the President adopted it, that he would\r\n     support it himself, and engage for all his connections.\r\n     The President repeated this twice, and with an air of\r\n     importance. Now, Mr. Morris has no family connections: he\r\n     engaged then for his political friends. This shows that\r\n     the President has not confidence enough in the virtue and\r\n     good sense of mankind, to confide in a government bottomed\r\n     on them, and thinks other props necessary.\r\n\r\n     [12] He observed, that eight or ten years ago, he\r\n     gave only fifty dollars to a common laborer for his farm,\r\n     finding him food and lodging. Now he gives one hundred\r\n     and fifty dollars, and even two hundred dollars to one.\r\n\r\n     [13] J.

M. Received first\r\nintelligence that twenty-seven sail were, on the morning of December\r\nthe 29th, just below Willoughby's Point. Sent off General Nelson, with\r\nfull powers.\r\n\r\n1781. January the 1st. No intelligence.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2d, ten o'clock, A. M. Information from N. Burwell, that\r\ntheir advance was at Warrasqueak Bay. Gave orders for militia, a quarter\r\nfrom some, and half from other counties. Assembly rose.\r\n\r\nWednesday, January the 3d, eight o'clock, P. M. Received a letter from\r\nE. Archer, Swan's Point, that at twelve o'clock that day they were at\r\nanchor a little below Jamestown. At five o'clock, P. M., of the same\r\nday, I had received a letter from R. Andrews for General Nelson, that\r\nthey were at Jamestown the evening of the 2d.\r\n\r\nThursday, January the 4th, five o'clock, A. M. Mr. Eppes and family, &c.,\r\ncame and informed me from the Speaker, that they had passed Kennon's and\r\nHood's the evening before; the tide having made for them at one o'clock,\r\nP. M., of the 3d, and the wind shifted to the east strong. They had not,\r\nhowever, passed Hood's, but anchored at Kennon's. Called whole militia\r\nfrom adjacent counties. I was then anxious to know whether they would\r\npass Westover, or not, as that would show the side they would land.\r\n\r\nFive o'clock, P. M. Learned by Captain De Ponthiere, that at two o'clock,\r\nP. M., they were drawn up at Westover. Then ordered arms, and stores,\r\n&c., (which till then had been carrying to Westham,) to be thrown across\r\nthe river at Richmond; and at half-past seven o'clock, P. M., set out\r\nto the foundry and Westham, and set Captain Brush, Captain Irish, and\r\nMr. Hylton, to see everything wagoned from the magazine and laboratory\r\nto Westham, and there thrown over; to work all night. The enemy encamped\r\nat Four-Mile Creek. I went to Tuckahoe and lodged.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 5th. Went early over the river with my family; sent them\r\nup to Fine Creek; went myself to Westham; gave orders for withdrawing\r\nammunition and arms (which lay exposed on the bank to the effect of\r\nartillery from opposite shore), behind a point. Then went to Manchester;\r\nhad a view of the enemy. My horse sunk under me with fatigue; borrowed\r\none, went to Chetwood's, appointed by Baron Steuben as a rendezvous and\r\nhead-quarters; but finding him not there, and understanding he would go\r\nto Colonel Henry's, I proceeded there for quarters. The enemy arrived in\r\nRichmond at one o'clock, P. M. One regiment of infantry and thirty horse\r\nproceeded, without stopping, to the foundry; burned that and the magazine\r\nand Ballendine's house, and went as far as Westham. They returned that\r\nevening to Richmond. Sent me a proposition to compound for property.\r\nRefused.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 6th. In the morning they burned certain houses and stores, and\r\nat twelve o'clock of that day left Richmond, and encamped at Four-Mile\r\nCreek. I went to Westham, ordered books and papers particularly from\r\nmagazine. In the evening I went up to Fine Creek.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 7th. I returned to Westham, and then came down to Manchester,\r\nwhere I lodged. The enemy encamped at Westover and Berkley. It had rained\r\nexcessively the preceding night, and continued to do so till about noon.\r\nGibson has one thousand; Steuben, eight hundred; Davis, two hundred;\r\nNelson, two hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 8th, at half-past seven o'clock, A. M. I returned to Richmond.\r\nThe wind gets, about this time, to north-west; a good gale; in the\r\nafternoon becomes easterly. The enemy remain in their last encampment.\r\nGeneral Nelson at Charles City C. H. Colonel Nicholas with three hundred\r\nmen at the Forest.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 9th, eleven o'clock. The wind is south-east, but almost\r\nnothing. The enemy remain in their last encampment, except embarking\r\ntheir horse.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 10th, at one o'clock, P. M. They embark infantry, and fall\r\ndown the river, the wind having shifted a little north of west, and\r\npretty fresh. Baron Steuben gets to Bland's Mills to-night, nine miles\r\nshort of Hood's.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 11th, eight o'clock, A. M. The wind due west, and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss sustained by the public._\r\n\r\nThe papers and books of the Council since the revolution. The papers of\r\nthe auditors, but not their books. Five brass field-pieces, four pounders,\r\nwhich had been sunk in the river, but were weighed by the enemy. About\r\none hundred and fifty arms in the Capitol loft. About one hundred and\r\nfifty in a wagon on the Brook road. About five tons of powder, and some\r\nmade ammunition at magazine. Some small proportion of the linens, cloths,\r\n&c., in the public store. Some quarter-masters' stores; the principal\r\narticles was one hundred and twenty sides of leather. Some of the tools\r\nin the artificers' shops. Foundry, magazine, four artificers' shops,\r\npublic store, quarter-masters' store, one artificers' shop, three wagons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe legislature was sitting when the entrance of the enemy into James\r\nriver was made known. They were informed, without reserve, of the\r\nmeasures adopted. Every suggestion from the members was welcomed and\r\nweighed, and their adjournment on the 2d of January furnished the most\r\nimmediate and confidential means of calling for the militia of their\r\nseveral counties. They accordingly became the bearers of those calls,\r\nand they were witnesses themselves, that every preparation was making\r\nwhich the exhausted and harassed state of the country admitted.\r\n\r\nThey met again at Richmond in May, and adjourned to Charlottesville,\r\nwhere they made a house on the 28th. My office of Governor expired on\r\nthe 2d of June, being the fifth day of the session; and no successor\r\nhad been appointed, when an enterprise on the 4th by Tarleton's cavalry\r\ndrove them thence, and they met again at Staunton on the 7th. Some\r\nmembers attended there who had not been at Richmond at the time of\r\nArnold's enterprise. One of these, George Nicholas, a very honest and\r\nable man, then, however, young and ardent, supposing there had been some\r\nremissness in the measures of the Executive on that occasion, moved for\r\nan inquiry into them, to be made at the succeeding session. The members\r\nwho had been present and privy to the transactions, courted the inquiry\r\non behalf of the executive. Mr. Nicholas, as a candid and honorable man,\r\nsent me, through a friend, a copy of the topics of inquiry he proposed\r\nto go into; and I communicated to him, with the same frankness, the\r\njustifications I should offer, that he might be prepared to refute them\r\nif not founded in fact. The following is a copy of both:--\r\n\r\n_1st Objection._--That General Washington's information was, that an\r\nembarcation was taking place, destined for this State.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--His information was, that it was destined for the Southward,\r\nas was _given out_ at New York. Had similar informations from General\r\nWashington, and Congress, been considered as sufficient ground at all\r\ntimes for calling the militia into the field, there would have been a\r\nstanding army of militia kept up; because there has never been a time,\r\nsince the invasion expected in December, 1779, but what we have had\r\nthose intimations hanging over our heads. The truth is, that General\r\nWashington always considered as his duty to convey every rumor of an\r\nembarkation; but we (for some time past, at least) never thought anything\r\nbut actual invasion should induce us to the expense and harassment of\r\ncalling the militia into the field: except in the case of December,\r\n1799, when it was thought proper to do this in order to convince the\r\nFrench of our disposition to protect their ships. Inattention to this\r\nnecessary economy, in the beginning, went far towards that ruin of our\r\nfinances which followed.\r\n\r\n_2d Objection._--Where were the post-riders, established last summer?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--They were established at Continental expense, to convey\r\nspeedy information to Congress of the arrival of the French fleet, then\r\nexpected here. When that arrived at Rhode Island, these expenses were\r\ndiscontinued. They were again established on the invasion in October,\r\nand discontinued when that ceased. And again on the first intimation\r\nof the invasion of December. But it will be asked, why were they not\r\nestablished on General Washington's letters? Because those letters were\r\nno more than we had received upon many former occasions, and would have\r\nled to a perpetual establishment of post-riders.\r\n\r\n_3d Objection._--If a proper number of men had been put into motion on\r\nMonday, for the relief of the lower country, and ordered to march to\r\nWilliamsburg, that they would at least have been in the neighborhood of\r\nRichmond on Thursday.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The order could not be till Tuesday, because we then received\r\nour first certain information. Half the militia of the counties round\r\nabout Richmond were then ordered out, and the whole of them on the\r\n4th, and ordered not to wait to come in a body, but in detachments as\r\nthey could assemble. Yet were there not on Friday more than two hundred\r\ncollected, and they were principally of the town of Richmond.\r\n\r\n_4th Objection._--That we had not the signals.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--This, though a favorite plan of some gentlemen, and perhaps\r\na practicable one, has hitherto been thought too difficult.\r\n\r\n_5th Objection._--That we had not look-outs.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--There had been no cause to order look-outs more than has been\r\never existing. This is only in fact asking why we do not always keep\r\nlook-outs.\r\n\r\n_6th Objection._--That we had not heavy artillery on travelling carriages.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The gentlemen, who acted as members of the Board of War a\r\ntwelvemonth can answer this question, by giving the character of the\r\nartificers whom, during that time, they could never get to mount the heavy\r\nartillery. The same reason prevented their being mounted from May, 1780,\r\nto December. We have even been unable to get those heavy cannon moved\r\nfrom Cumberland by the whole energy of government. A like difficulty\r\nwhich occurred in the removal of those at South Quay, in their day, will\r\nconvince them of the possibility of this.\r\n\r\n_7th Objection._--That there was not a body of militia thrown into\r\nPortsmouth, the great bridge, Suffolk.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--In the summer of 1780, we asked the favor of General Nelson, to\r\ncall together the County Lieutenants of the lower counties, and concert\r\nthe general measures which should be taken for instant opposition,\r\non any invasion, until aid could be ordered by the Executive; and the\r\nCounty Lieutenants were ordered to obey his call; he did so the first\r\nmoment, to wit, on Saturday, December the 31st, at 8 o'clock A. M., of\r\nour receiving information of the appearance of a fleet in the bay. We\r\nasked the favor of General Nelson to go down, which he did, with full\r\npowers to call together the militia of any counties he thought proper, to\r\ncall on the keepers of any public arms or stores, and to adopt for the\r\ninstant such measures as exigencies required, till we could be better\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n_Query._--Why were not General Nelson, and the brave officers with him,\r\nparticularly mentioned?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--What should have been said of them? The enemy did not land,\r\nnor give them an opportunity of doing what nobody doubts they would have\r\ndone; that is, something worthy of being minutely recited.\r\n\r\n_Query._--Why publish Arnold's letter without General Nelson's answer?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Ask the printer. He got neither from the Executive.\r\n\r\n_Objection._--As to the calling out a few militia, and that late.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--It is denied that they were few or late. Four thousand and\r\nseven hundred men (the number required by Baron Steuben) were called\r\nout the moment an invasion was known to have taken place, that is on\r\nTuesday, January 2d.\r\n\r\n_Objection._--The abandonment of York and Portsmouth fortifications.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--How can they be kept without regulars, on the large scale on\r\nwhich they were formed? Would it be approved of to harass the militia\r\nwith garrisoning them?\r\n\r\nTo place me on equal ground for meeting the inquiry, one of the\r\nrepresentatives of my county resigned his seat, and I was unanimously\r\nelected in his place. Mr. Nicholas, however, before the day, became\r\nbetter satisfied as to what had been done, and did not appear to bring\r\nforward the inquiry; and in a publication, several years after, he made\r\nhonorable acknowledgment of the erroneous views he had entertained on\r\nthose transactions. I therefore read in my place the inquiries he had\r\nproposed to make, and stated the justifications of the Executive. And\r\nnearly every member present having been a witness to their truth, and\r\nconscious all was done which could have been done, concurred at once in\r\nthe following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"The following resolution was _unanimously_ agreed to by both houses of\r\nthe General Assembly of Virginia, December the 19th, 1781.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the sincere thanks of the General Assembly be given\r\nto our former Governor, Thomas Jefferson, Esquire, for his impartial,\r\nupright, and attentive administration whilst in office. The Assembly\r\nwish in the strongest manner to declare the high opinion they entertain\r\nof Mr. Jefferson's ability, rectitude, and integrity as Chief Magistrate\r\nof this Commonwealth, and mean, by thus publicly avowing their opinion,\r\nto obviate and to remove all unmerited censure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here it is but proper to notice the parody of these transactions which\r\nGeneral Lee has given as their history. He was in a distant State at the\r\ntime, and seems to have made up a random account from the rumors which\r\nwere afloat where he then was. It is a tissue of errors from beginning\r\nto end.\r\n\r\nThe nonsense which has been uttered on the _coup de main_ of Tarleton on\r\nCharlottesville is really so ridiculous, that it is almost ridiculous\r\nseriously to notice it. I will briefly, however, notice facts and\r\ndates. It has been said before, that the legislature was driven from\r\nCharlottesville by an incursion of the enemy's cavalry. Since the\r\nadjournment from Richmond, their force in this country had been greatly\r\naugmented by reinforcements under Lord Cornwallis and General Phillips;\r\nand they had advanced up into the country as far as Elk Island, and\r\nthe Fork of James river. Learning that the legislature was in session\r\nat Charlottesville, they detached Colonel Tarleton with his legion of\r\nhorse to surprise them. As he was passing through Louisa on the evening\r\nof the 3d of June, he was observed by a Mr. Gouett, who, suspecting the\r\nobject, set out immediately for Charlottesville, and knowing the byways\r\nof the neighborhood, passed the enemy's encampment, rode all night,\r\nand before sunrise of the 4th, called at Monticello with notice of what\r\nhe had seen, and passed on to Charlottesville to notify the members of\r\nthe legislature. The Speakers of the two houses, and some other members\r\nwere lodging with us. I ordered a carriage to be ready to carry off my\r\nfamily; we breakfasted at leisure with our guests, and after breakfast\r\nthey had gone to Charlottesville; when a neighbor rode up full speed\r\nto inform me that a troop of horse was then ascending the hill to the\r\nhouse. I instantly sent off my family, and after a short delay for some\r\npressing arrangements, I mounted my horse; and knowing that in the public\r\nroad I should be liable to fall in with the enemy, I went through the\r\nwoods, and joined my family at the house of a friend, where we dined.\r\nWould it be believed, were it not known, that this flight from a troop\r\nof horse, whose whole legion, too, was within supporting distance, has\r\nbeen the subject, with party writers, of volumes of reproach on me,\r\nserious or sarcastic? That it has been sung in verse, and said in humble\r\nprose, that forgetting the noble example of the hero of La Mancha, and\r\nhis wind-mills, I declined a combat singly against a troop, in which\r\nvictory would have been so glorious? Forgetting, themselves, at the same\r\ntime, that I was not provided with the enchanted arms of the Knight, nor\r\neven with his helmet of Mambrino. These closet heroes, forsooth, would\r\nhave disdained the shelter of a wood, even singly and unarmed, against\r\na legion of armed enemies.\r\n\r\nHere, too, I must note another instance of the want of that correctness\r\nin writing history, without which it becomes romance. General Lee says\r\nthat Tarleton, in another enterprise some time after, penetrated up the\r\nsouth side of James river to New London, in Bedford county. To that\r\nneighborhood precisely, where I had a possession, I had carried my\r\nfamily, and was confined there several weeks by the effects of a fall\r\nfrom my horse; and I can assure the readers of General Lee's history,\r\nthat no enemy ever came within forty miles of New London.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum relative to invasion of Virginia in 1780, 1781._\r\n\r\n     Among the manuscripts of Mr. Jefferson, and _in his own hand\r\n     writing_, is the following paper in relation to the invasion\r\n     of Virginia in 1780-1781. It is, therefore, inserted here, in\r\n     connection with the foregoing extract from his diary.\r\n\r\nRichmond, 1780. Dec. 31st, at 8 A. M. The Governor received the first\r\nintelligence that twenty-seven sail of ships had entered Chesapeake Bay,\r\nand were in the morning of the 29th just below Willoughby's point, [the\r\nsouthern cape of James river,] their destination unknown.\r\n\r\n1781. January 2, at 10 A. M. Information received that they had entered\r\nJames river, their advance being at Warrasqueak Bay. Orders were\r\nimmediately given for calling in the militia, one-fourth from some, and\r\nhalf from other counties. The members of the legislature, which rises\r\nthis day, are the bearers of the orders to their respective counties.\r\nThe Governor directs the removal of the records into the country, and\r\nthe transportation of the military stores from Richmond to Westham, [on\r\nthe river seven miles above,] there to be carried across the river.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3d. 8 P. M. The enemy are said to be a little below Jamestown;\r\nconvenient for landing, if Williamsburg is their object.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4th, at 5 A. M. Information is received that they had passed\r\nKennon's and Hoods the evening before with a strong easterly wind, which\r\ndetermines their object to be either Petersburg or Richmond. The Governor\r\nnow calls in the whole militia from the adjacent counties.\r\n\r\nAt 5 P. M. Information that at 2 P. M. they were landed and drawn up at\r\nWestover, [on the north side of the river, and twenty-five miles below\r\nRichmond,] and consequently Richmond was their destination. Orders are\r\nnow given to discontinue wagoning the military stores from Richmond to\r\nWestham, and to throw them across directly at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe Governor having attended to this till an hour and a half in the\r\nnight, then rode up to the foundry, [one mile below Westham,] ordered\r\nCaptains Brush and Irish, and Mr. Hylton to continue all night wagoning\r\nto Westham the arms and stores still at the foundry, to be thrown across\r\nthe river at Westham, then proceeded to Westham to urge the pressing\r\nthe transportation there across the river, and thence went to Tuckahoe\r\n[eight miles above, and on the same side of the river] to see after his\r\nfamily, which he had sent that far in the course of the day. He arrived\r\nthere at 1 o'clock in the night.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning he carried his family across the river there, and\r\nsending them to Teine creek, [eight miles higher up,] went himself to\r\nBreton's on the south side of the river, [opposite to Westham,] finding\r\nthe arms, &c., in a heap near the shore, and exposed to be destroyed by\r\ncannon from the north bank. He had them removed under cover of a point\r\nof land near by. He proceeded to Manchester [opposite to Richmond]. The\r\nenemy had arrived at Richmond at 1 P. M. Having found that nearly the\r\nwhole arms had been got there from Richmond, he set out for Chetwood's\r\nto meet with Baron Steuben, who had appointed that place as a rendezvous\r\nand head-quarters; but not finding him there, and understanding that he\r\nwould be at Colonel Fleming's, [six miles above Breton's,] he proceeded\r\nthither. The enemy had now a detachment at Westham, and sent a deputation\r\nfrom the city of Richmond to the Governor at Colonel Fleming's to propose\r\nterms for ransoming the safety of the city, which terms he rejected. The\r\nGovernor returned to Breton's, had measures taken more effectually to\r\nsecure the books and papers there. The enemy having burnt some houses and\r\nstores, left Richmond, after twenty-four hours stay there, and encamped\r\nat Four-Mile Creek, [eight or ten miles below,] and the Governor went\r\nto look to his family at Fine Creek.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Breton's to see further to the arms there, exposed on\r\nthe ground to heavy rains which had fallen the night before, and then\r\nproceeded to Manchester, and lodged there. The enemy encamped at Westover.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 7 A. M. he crossed over to Richmond, and resumed his\r\nresidence there. The enemy are still retained in their encampment at\r\nWestover by an easterly wind. Col. John Nicholas has now three hundred\r\nmilitia at the Forest, [six miles off from Westover,] General Nelson\r\ntwo hundred at Charles City Court House, [eight miles below Westover,]\r\nGibson one thousand, and Baron Steuben eight hundred on the south side\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th. The enemy are still encamped at Westover.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th. At 1 P. M. they embark; and the wind having shifted a little\r\nto the north of the west, and pretty fresh, they fall down the river.\r\nBaron Steuben marches for Hood's, where their passage may be checked.\r\nHe reaches Bland's Mills in the evening, within nine miles of Hood's.\r\n\r\nJanuary 11th. At 8 A. M. the wind due west and strong, they may make\r\ngood their retreat. During this period time and place have been minutely\r\ncited, in order that those who think there was any remissness in the\r\nmovements of the Governor, may lay their finger on the point, and say\r\nwhen and where it was. Hereafter less detail will suffice.\r\n\r\nSoon after this General Phillips having joined Arnold with a reinforcement\r\nof two thousand men, they advanced again up to Petersburg, and about\r\nthe last of April to Manchester. The Governor had remained constantly\r\nin and about Richmond, exerting all his powers collecting militia, and\r\nproviding such means for the defence of the State as its exhausted\r\nresources admitted. Never assuming a guard, and with only the river\r\nbetween him and the enemy, his lodgings were frequently within four,\r\nfive, or six miles of them.\r\n\r\nM. de la Fayette, about this time, arrived at Richmond with some\r\nContinental troops, with which, and the militia collected, he continued\r\nto occupy that place, and the north bank of the river, while Phillips\r\nand Arnold held Manchester and the south bank. But Lord Cornwallis, about\r\nthe middle of May, joining the main southern armies, M. de la Fayette was\r\nobliged to retire. The enemy crossed the river, and advanced up into the\r\ncountry about fifty miles, and within thirty miles of Charlottesville, at\r\nwhich place the legislature being to meet in June, the Governor proceeded\r\nto his seat at Monticello, two or three miles from it. His office was\r\nnow near expiring, the country under invasion by a powerful army, no\r\nservices but military of any avail, unprepared by his line of life and\r\neducation for the command of armies, he believed it right not to stand\r\nin the way of talents better fitted than his own to the circumstances\r\nunder which the country was placed. He therefore himself proposed to\r\nhis friends in the legislature that General Nelson, who commanded the\r\nmilitia of the State, should be appointed Governor, as he was sensible\r\nthat the union of the civil and military power in the same hands at\r\nthis time, would greatly facilitate military measures. This appointment\r\naccordingly took place on the 12th of June, 1781.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things when, his office having actually expired,\r\nand no successor as yet in place, Colonel Tarleton, with his regiment\r\nof horse, was detached by Lord Cornwallis to surprise Mr. Jefferson\r\n(whom they thought still in office) and the legislature now sitting in\r\nCharlottesville. The Speakers of the two houses, and some other members of\r\nthe legislature, were lodging with Mr. Jefferson at Monticello. Tarleton,\r\nearly in the morning, when within ten miles of that place, detached a\r\ncompany of horse to secure him and his guests, and proceeded himself\r\nrapidly with his main body to Charlottesville, where he hoped to find\r\nthe legislature unapprized of his movement. Notice of it, however, had\r\nbeen brought, both to Monticello and Charlottesville, about sun-rise. The\r\nSpeakers with their colleagues, returned to Charlottesville, and with the\r\nother members of the legislature, had barely time to get out of his way.\r\nMr. Jefferson sent off his family to secure them from danger, and was\r\nhimself still at Monticello making arrangements for his own departure,\r\nwhen a Lieutenant Hudson arrived there at half speed, and informed him\r\nthat the enemy were then ascending the hill of Monticello. He departed\r\nimmediately, and knowing that he would be pursued if he took the high\r\nroad, he plunged into the woods of the adjoining mountain, where being\r\nat once safe, he proceeded to overtake his family. This is the famous\r\nadventure of Carter's mountain, which has been so often resounded through\r\nthe slanderous chronicles of federalism. But they have taken care never\r\nto detail the facts, lest these should show that this favorite charge\r\namounted to nothing more than that he did not remain in his house, and\r\nthere singly fight a whole troop of horse, or suffer himself to be taken\r\nprisoner. Having accompanied his family one day's journey, he returned\r\nto Monticello. Tarleton had retired after eighteen hours' stay in\r\nCharlottesville. Mr. Jefferson then rejoined his family, and proceeded\r\nwith them to an estate he had in Bedford, about eighty miles south-west,\r\nwhere, riding on his farm some time after, he was thrown from his horse,\r\nand disabled from riding on horseback for a considerable time. But Mr.\r\nTurner finds it more convenient to give him this fall in his retreat\r\nbefore Tarleton, which had happened some weeks before, as a proof that\r\nhe withdrew from a troop of horse with a precipitancy which Don Quixotte\r\nwould not have practiced.\r\n\r\nThe facts here stated most particularly, with date of time and place, are\r\ntaken from the notes made by the writer hereof for his own satisfaction\r\nat the time. The others are from memory, but so well recollected that\r\nhe is satisfied there is no material fact mis-stated. Should any person\r\nundertake to contradict any particular on evidence which may at all merit\r\nthe public respect, the writer will take the trouble (though not at all\r\nin the best situation for it) to produce the proof in support of it. He\r\nfinds, indeed, that of the persons whom he recollects to have been present\r\non these occasions, few have survived the intermediate lapse of four\r\nand twenty years. Yet he trusts that some, as well as himself, are yet\r\namong the living; and he is positively certain that no man can falsify\r\nany material fact here stated. He well remembers, indeed, that there\r\nwere then, as there are at all times, some who blamed everything done\r\ncontrary to their own opinion, although their opinions were formed on a\r\nvery partial knowledge of facts. The censures which have been heralded by\r\nsuch men as Wm. Turner, are nothing but revivals of these half-informed\r\nopinions. Mr. George Nicholas, then a very young man, but always a very\r\nhonest one, was prompted by these persons to bring specific charges\r\nagainst Mr. Jefferson; the heads of these in writing were communicated\r\nthrough a mutual friend to Mr. Jefferson, who committed to writing also\r\nthe heads of justification on each of them. I well remember this paper,\r\nand believe the original of it still exists; and though framed when\r\nevery real fact was fresh in the knowledge of every one, this fabricated\r\nflight from Richmond was not among the charges stated in this paper,\r\nnor any charge against Mr. Jefferson for not fighting singly the troop\r\nof horse. Mr. Nicholas candidly relinquished further proceeding. The\r\nHouse of Representatives of Virginia pronounced an honorable sentence\r\nof entire approbation of Mr. Jefferson's conduct, and so much the more\r\nhonorable as themselves had been witness to it. And Mr. George Nicholas\r\ntook a conspicuous occasion afterwards, of his own free will, and when the\r\nmatter was entirely at rest, to retract publicly the erroneous opinions\r\nhe had been led into on that occasion, and to make just reparation by\r\na candid acknowledgment of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Instructions to the Ministers Plenipotentiary appointed to negotiate\r\ntreaties of commerce with the European nations. May 7, 1784._\r\n\r\nWhereas, instructions bearing date the 29th day of October, 1783, were\r\nsent to the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States of America\r\nat the Court of Versailles, empowered to negotiate a peace, or to any\r\none or more of them, for concerting drafts or propositions for treaties\r\nof amity and commerce with the commercial powers of Europe:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it will be advantageous to these United States to\r\nconclude such treaties with Russia, the Court of Vienna, Prussia, Denmark,\r\nSaxony, Hamburg, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Genoa, Tuscany, Rome,\r\nNaples, Venice, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Porte.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in the formation of these treaties the following points\r\nbe carefully stipulated:\r\n\r\n1st. That each party shall have a right to carry their own produce,\r\nmanufactures, and merchandise, in their own bottoms to the ports of the\r\nother, and thence the produce and merchandise of the other, paying, in\r\nboth cases, such duties only as are paid by the most favored nation,\r\nfreely, where it is freely granted to such nation, or paying the\r\ncompensation where such nation does the same.\r\n\r\n2. That with the nations holding territorial possessions in America,\r\na direct and similar intercourse be admitted between the United States\r\nand such possessions; or if this cannot be obtained, then a direct and\r\nsimilar intercourse between the United States and certain free ports\r\nwithin such possessions; that if this neither can be obtained, permission\r\nbe stipulated to bring from such possessions, in their own bottoms, the\r\nproduce and merchandise thereof to their States directly; and for these\r\nStates to carry in their own bottoms their produce and merchandise to\r\nsuch possessions directly.\r\n\r\n3. That these United States be considered in all such treaties, and in\r\nevery case arising under them, as one nation, upon the principles of\r\nthe federal constitution.\r\n\r\n4. That it be proposed, though not indispensably required, that if war\r\nshould hereafter arise between the two contracting parties, the merchants\r\nof either country, then residing in the other, shall be allowed to remain\r\nnine months to collect their debts and settle their affairs, and may\r\ndepart freely, carrying off all their effects, without molestation or\r\nhinderance; and all fishermen, all cultivators of the earth, and all\r\nartisans or manufacturers, unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns,\r\nvillages or places, who labor for the common subsistence and benefit of\r\nmankind, and peaceably following their respective employments, shall be\r\nallowed to continue the same, and shall not be molested by the armed force\r\nof the enemy, in whose power, by the events of war, they may happen to\r\nfall; but if anything is necessary to be taken from them, for the use of\r\nsuch armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price; and\r\nall merchants and traders, exchanging the products of different places,\r\nand thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences, and comforts of\r\nhuman life more easy to obtain and more general, shall be allowed to\r\npass free and unmolested; and neither of the contracting powers shall\r\ngrant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering\r\nthem to take or destroy such trading ships, or interrupt such commerce.\r\n\r\n5. And in case either of the contracting parties shall happen to be\r\nengaged in war with any other nation, it be further agreed, in order to\r\nprevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise\r\nrespecting the merchandise heretofore called contraband, such as arms,\r\nammunition and military stores of all kinds, that no such articles,\r\ncarrying by the ships or subjects of one of the parties to the enemies of\r\nthe other, shall, on any account, be deemed contraband, so as to induce\r\nconfiscation, and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless, it\r\nshall be lawful to stop such ships and detain them for such length of\r\ntime as the captors may think necessary, to prevent the inconvenience\r\nor damage that might ensue, from their proceeding on their voyage,\r\npaying, however, a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest\r\nshall occasion to the proprietors; and it shall be further allowed to\r\nuse in the service of the captors, the whole or any part of the military\r\nstores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same, to\r\nbe ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination.\r\nBut if the other contracting party will not consent to discontinue the\r\nconfiscation of contraband goods, then that it be stipulated, that if\r\nthe master of the vessel stopped, will deliver out the goods charged to\r\nbe contraband, he shall be admitted to do it, and the vessel shall not\r\nin that case be carried into any port; but shall be allowed to proceed\r\non her voyage.\r\n\r\n6. That in the same case, when either of the contracting parties\r\nshall happen to be engaged in war with any other power, all goods, not\r\ncontraband, belonging to the subjects of that other power, and shipped in\r\nthe bottoms of the party hereto, who is not engaged in the war, shall be\r\nentirely free. And that to ascertain what shall constitute the blockade\r\nof any place or port, it shall be understood to be in such predicament,\r\nwhen the assailing power shall have taken such a station as to expose to\r\nimminent danger any ship or ships, that would attempt to sail in or out\r\nof the said port; and that no vessel of the party, who is not engaged\r\nin the said war, shall be stopped without a material and well-grounded\r\ncause; and in such cases justice shall be done, and an indemnification\r\ngiven, without loss of time to the persons aggrieved, and thus stopped\r\nwithout sufficient cause.\r\n\r\n7. That no right be stipulated for aliens to hold real property within\r\nthese States, this being utterly inadmissible by their several laws and\r\npolicy; but when on the death of any person holding real estate within\r\nthe territories of one of the contracting parties, such real estate would\r\nby their laws descend on a subject or citizen of the other, were he not\r\ndisqualified by alienage, then he shall be allowed a reasonable time to\r\ndispose of the same, and withdraw the proceeds without molestation.\r\n\r\n8. That such treaties be made for a term not exceeding ten years from\r\nthe exchange of ratification.\r\n\r\n9. That these instructions be considered as supplementary to those of\r\nOctober 29th, 1783; and not as revoking, except when they contradict\r\nthem. That where in treaty with a particular nation they can procure\r\nparticular advantages, to the specification of which we have been\r\nunable to descend, our object in these instructions having been to form\r\noutlines only and general principles of treaty with many nations, it is\r\nour expectation they will procure them, though not pointed out in these\r\ninstructions; and where they may be able to form treaties on principles\r\nwhich, in their judgment, will be more beneficial to the United States\r\nthan those herein directed to be made their basis, they are permitted to\r\nadopt such principles. That as to the duration of treaties, though we\r\nhave proposed to restrain them to the term of ten years, yet they are\r\nat liberty to extend the same as far as fifteen years with any nation\r\nwhich may pertinaciously insist thereon. And that it will be agreeable\r\nto us to have supplementary treaties with France, the United Netherlands\r\nand Sweden, which may bring the treaties we have entered into with them\r\nas nearly as may be to the principles of those now directed; but that\r\nthis be not pressed, if the proposal should be found disagreeable.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That treaties of amity, or of amity and commerce, be entered\r\ninto with Morocco, and the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, to\r\ncontinue for the same term of ten years, or for a term as much longer\r\nas can be procured.\r\n\r\nThat our Ministers, to be commissioned for treating with foreign nations,\r\nmake known to the Emperor of Morocco the great satisfaction which Congress\r\nfeel from the amicable disposition he has shown towards these States,\r\nand his readiness to enter into alliance with them. That the occupations\r\nof the war, and distance of our situation have prevented our meeting his\r\nfriendship so early as we wished. But the powers are now delegated to\r\nthem for entering into treaty with him, in the execution of which they\r\nare ready to proceed, and that as to the expenses of his Minister, they\r\ndo therein what is for the honor and interest of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a commission be issued to Mr. J. Adams, Mr. B. Franklin,\r\nand Mr. T. Jefferson, giving powers to them, or the greater part of them,\r\nto make and receive propositions for such treaties of amity and commerce,\r\nand to negotiate and sign the same, transmitting them to Congress for\r\ntheir final ratification; and that such commission be in force for a\r\nterm not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_Report of a conference with the Count de Vergennes on the subject\r\nof the Commerce of the United States with France._[14]\r\n\r\nThe next levee day at Versailles, I meant to bring again under the view\r\nof the Count de Vergennes, the whole subject of our commerce with France;\r\nbut the number of audiences of ambassadors and other ministers, which\r\ntake place, of course, before mine, and which seldom, indeed, leave me\r\nan opportunity of audience at all, prevented me that day. I was only\r\nable to ask the Count de Vergennes, as a particular favor, that he would\r\npermit me to wait on him some day that week. He did so, and I went to\r\nVersailles the Friday following, (the 9th of December.) M. de Reyneval\r\nwas with the Count. Our conversation began with the usual topic; that\r\nthe trade of the United States had not yet learned the way to France,\r\nbut continued to centre in England, though no longer obliged by law\r\nto go there. I observed, that the real cause of this, was to be found\r\nin the difference of the commercial arrangements in the two countries;\r\nthat merchants would not, and could not trade but where there was to be\r\nsome gain; that the commerce between two countries could not be kept\r\nup, but by an exchange of commodities; that, if an American merchant\r\nwas forced to carry his produce to London, it could not be expected he\r\nwould make a voyage from thence to France, with the money, to lay it\r\nout here; and, in like manner, that if he could bring his commodities,\r\nwith advantage, to this country, he would not make another voyage to\r\nEngland, with the money, to lay it out there, but would take in exchange\r\nthe merchandise of this country. The Count de Vergennes agreed to this,\r\nand particularly that where there was no exchange of merchandise, there\r\ncould be no durable commerce; and that it was natural for merchants to\r\ntake their returns in the port where they sold their cargo. I desired\r\nhis permission then, to take a summary view of the productions of the\r\nUnited States, that we might see which of them could be brought here to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n1. Rice. France gets from the Mediterranean a rice not so good indeed,\r\nbut cheaper than ours. He said that they bought of our rice, but that\r\nthey got from Egypt also, rice of a very fine quality. I observed that\r\nsuch was the actual state of their commerce, in that article, that they\r\ntake little from us. 2. Indigo. They make a plenty in their own colonies.\r\nHe observed that they did, and that they thought it better than ours. 3.\r\nFlour, fish, and provisions of all sorts, they produce for themselves.\r\nThat these articles might, therefore, be considered as not existing,\r\nfor commerce, between the United States and the kingdom of France.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to those capable of becoming objects of exchange between\r\nthe two nations. 1. Peltry and furs. Our posts being in the hands of the\r\nEnglish, we are cut off from that article. I am not sure even, whether\r\nwe are not obliged to buy of them, for our own use. When these posts are\r\ngiven up, if ever they are, we shall be able to furnish France with skins\r\nand furs, to the amount of two millions of livres, in exchange for her\r\nmerchandise; but at present, these articles are to be counted as nothing.\r\n2. Potash. An experiment is making whether this can be brought here. We\r\nhope it may, but at present it stands for nothing. He observed that it was\r\nmuch wanted in France, and he thought it would succeed. 3. Naval stores.\r\nTrials are also making on these, as subjects of commerce with France.\r\nThey are heavy, and the voyage long. The result, therefore, is doubtful.\r\nAt present, they are as nothing in our commerce with this country. 4.\r\nWhale oil. I told him I had great hopes that the late diminution of duty\r\nwould enable us to bring this article, with advantage, to France; that\r\na merchant was just arrived (Mr. Barrett) who proposed to settle at\r\nL'Orient, for the purpose of selling the cargoes of this article, and\r\nchoosing the returns. That he had informed me, that in the first year,\r\nit would be necessary to take one-third in money, and the remainder\r\nonly in merchandise; because the fishermen require, indispensably, some\r\nmoney. But he thought that after the first year, the merchandise of\r\nthe preceding year, would always produce money for the ensuing one, and\r\nthat the whole amount would continue to be taken annually afterwards, in\r\nmerchandise. I added, that though the diminution of duty was expressed\r\nto be but for one year, yet I hoped they would find their advantage in\r\nrenewing and continuing it; for that if they intended really to admit it\r\nfor one year only, the fishermen would not find it worth while to rebuild\r\ntheir vessels, and to prepare themselves for the business. The Count\r\nexpressed satisfaction on the view of commercial exchange held up by this\r\narticle. He made no answer as to the continuance of it; and I did not\r\nchoose to tell him, at that time, that we should claim its continuance\r\nunder their treaty with the Hanseatic towns, which fixes this duty for\r\nthem, and our own treaty, which gives, us the rights of the most favored\r\nnation. 5. Tobacco. I recalled to the memory of the Count de Vergennes,\r\nthe letter I had written to him on this article; and the object of the\r\npresent conversation being, how to facilitate the exchange of commerciable\r\narticles between the two countries, I pressed that of tobacco, in this\r\npoint of view; observed that France, at present, paid us two millions\r\nof livres for this article; that for such portions of it as were bought\r\nin London, they sent the money directly there, and for what they bought\r\nin the United States, the money was still remitted to London, by bills\r\nof exchange; whereas, if they would permit our merchants to sell this\r\narticle freely, they would bring it here, and take the returns on the\r\nspot, in merchandise, not money. The Count observed, that my proposition\r\ncontained what was doubtless useful, but that the King received on this\r\narticle, at present, a revenue of twenty-eight millions, which was so\r\nconsiderable, as to render them fearful of tampering with it; that the\r\ncollection of this revenue by way of Farm, was of very ancient date, and\r\nthat it was always hazardous to alter arrangements of long standing,\r\nand of such infinite combinations with the fiscal system. I answered,\r\nthat the simplicity of the mode of collection proposed for this article,\r\nwithdrew it from all fear of deranging other parts of their system; that\r\nI supposed they would confine the importation to some of their principal\r\nports, probably not more than five or six; that a single collector in\r\neach of these, was the only new officer requisite; that he could get rich\r\nhimself on six livres a hogshead, and would receive the whole revenue,\r\nand pay it into the treasury, at short hand. M. de Reyneval entered\r\nparticularly into this part of the conversation, and explained to the\r\nCount, more in detail, the advantages and simplicity of it, and concluded\r\nby observing to me, that it sometimes happened that useful propositions,\r\nthough not practicable at one time, might become so at another. I told\r\nhim that that consideration had induced me to press the matter when I\r\ndid, because I had understood the renewal of the Farm was then on the\r\ncarpet, and that it was the precise moment when I supposed that this\r\nportion might be detached from the mass of the Farms. I asked Count de\r\nVergennes whether, if the renewal of the Farm was pressing, this article\r\nmight not be separated, merely in suspense, till government should have\r\ntime to satisfy themselves on the expediency of renewing it. He said no\r\npromises could be made.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this conversation, he had mentioned the liberty we\r\nenjoyed of carrying our fish to the French islands. I repeated to him\r\nwhat I had hinted in my letter, of November the 20th, 1785, that I\r\nconsidered as a prohibition the laying such duties on our fish, and\r\ngiving such premiums on theirs, as made a difference between their and\r\nour fishermen of fifteen livres the quintal, in an article which sold\r\nfor but fifteen livres. He said it would not have that effect, for two\r\nreasons: 1. That their fishermen could not furnish supplies sufficient\r\nfor their islands, and, of course, the inhabitants must, of necessity,\r\nbuy our fish. 2. That from the constancy of our fishery, and the short\r\nseason during which theirs continued, and also from the economy and\r\nmanagement of ours, compared with the expense of theirs, we had always\r\nbeen able to sell our fish, in their islands, at twenty-five livres the\r\nquintal, while they were obliged to ask thirty-six livres. (I suppose he\r\nmeant the livre of the French islands.) That thus, the duty and premium\r\nhad been a necessary operation on their side, to place the sale of their\r\nfish on a level with ours, and that without this, theirs could not bear\r\nthe competition.\r\n\r\nI have here brought together the substance of what was said on the\r\npreceding subjects, not pretending to give it verbatim, which my memory\r\ndoes not enable me to do. I have, probably, omitted many things which were\r\nspoken, but have mentioned nothing which was not. It was interrupted, at\r\ntimes, with collateral matters. One of these was important. The Count\r\nde Vergennes complained, and with a good deal of stress, that they did\r\nnot find a sufficient dependence on arrangements taken with us. This\r\nwas the third time too, he had done it; first, in a conversation at\r\nFontainebleau, when he first complained to me of the navigation acts of\r\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire; secondly, in his letter of October the\r\n30th, 1785, on the same subject; and now, in the present conversation,\r\nwherein he added, as another instance, the case of the Chevalier de\r\nMezieres, heir of General Oglethorpe, who, notwithstanding that the 11th\r\narticle of the treaty provides, that the subjects or citizens of either\r\nparty shall succeed, _ab intestato_, to the lands of their ancestors,\r\nwithin the dominions of the other, had been informed from Mr. Adams,\r\nand by me also, that his right of succession to the General's estate in\r\nGeorgia was doubtful. He observed too, that the administration of justice\r\nwith us was tardy, insomuch that their merchants, when they had money\r\ndue to them within our States, considered it as desperate; and that our\r\ncommercial regulations, in general, were disgusting to them. These ideas\r\nwere new, serious and delicate. I decided, therefore, not to enter into\r\nthem at that moment, and the rather, as we were speaking in French, in\r\nwhich language I did not choose to hazard myself. I withdrew from the\r\nobjections of the tardiness of justice with us, and the disagreeableness\r\nof our commercial regulations, by a general observation, that I was not\r\nsensible they were well founded. With respect to the case of the Chevalier\r\nde Mezieres, I was obliged to enter into some explanations. They related\r\nchiefly to the legal operation of our Declaration of Independence, to the\r\nundecided question whether our citizens and British subjects were thereby\r\nmade aliens to one another, to the general laws as to conveyances of\r\nland to aliens, and the doubt whether an act of the Assembly of Georgia\r\nmight not have been passed, to confiscate General Oglethorpe's property,\r\nwhich would of course prevent its devolution on any heir. Mr. Reyneval\r\nobserved, that in this case, it became a mere question of fact, whether a\r\nconfiscation of these lands had taken place before the death of General\r\nOglethorpe, which fact might be easily known by inquiries in Georgia,\r\nwhere the possessions lay. I thought it very material, that the opinion\r\nof this court should be set to rights on these points. On my return,\r\ntherefore, I wrote the following observations on them, which, the next\r\ntime I went to Versailles, (not having an opportunity of speaking to\r\nthe Count de Vergennes,) I put into the hands of M. Reyneval, praying\r\nhim to read them, and to ask the favor of the Count to do the same.\r\n\r\n     _Explanations on some of the subjects of conversation which I had\r\n     the honor of having with his Excellency, the Count de Vergennes,\r\n     when I was last at Versailles._\r\n\r\nThe principal design of that conversation was, to discuss those articles\r\nof commerce which the United States could spare, which are wanted in\r\nFrance, and if received there on a convenient footing, would be exchanged\r\nfor the productions of France. But in the course of the conversation,\r\nsome circumstances were incidentally mentioned by the Count de Vergennes,\r\nwhich induced me to suppose he had received impressions, neither favorable\r\nto us, nor derived from perfect information.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Chevalier de Mezieres was supposed to furnish an instance\r\nof our disregard to treaties; and the event of that case was inferred\r\nfrom opinions supposed to have been given by Mr. Adams and myself. This\r\nis ascribing a weight to our opinions, to which they are not entitled.\r\nThey will have no influence on the decision of the case. The judges in\r\nour courts, would not suffer them to be read. Their guide is the law of\r\nthe land, of which law its treaties make a part. Indeed, I know not what\r\nopinion Mr. Adams may have given on the case. And, if any be imputed\r\nto him derogatory of our regard to the treaty with France, I think\r\nhis opinion has been misunderstood. With respect to myself, the doubts\r\nwhich I expressed to the Chevalier de Mezieres, as to the success of his\r\nclaims, were not founded on any question whether the treaty between France\r\nand the United States would be observed. On the contrary, I venture to\r\npronounce that it will be religiously observed, if his case comes under\r\nit. But I doubted whether it would come under the treaty. The case, as\r\nI understand it, is this: General Oglethorpe, a British subject, had\r\nlands in Georgia. He died since the peace, having devised these lands\r\nto his wife. His heirs are the Chevalier de Mezieres, son of his elder\r\nsister, and the Marquis de Bellegarde, son of his younger sister. This\r\ncase gives rise to legal questions, some of which have not yet been\r\ndecided, either in England or America, the laws of which countries are\r\nnearly the same.\r\n\r\n1. It is a question under the laws of those countries, whether persons\r\n_born before their separation_, and once completely invested, in both,\r\nwith the character of natural subjects, can ever become aliens in either?\r\nThere are respectable opinions on both sides. If the negative be right,\r\nthen General Oglethorpe having never become an alien, and having devised\r\nhis lands to his wife, who, on this supposition, also, was not an alien,\r\nthe devise has transferred the lands to her, and there is nothing left\r\nfor the treaty to operate on.\r\n\r\n2. If the affirmative opinion be right, and the inhabitants of Great\r\nBritain and America, _born before the Revolution_, are become aliens to\r\neach other, it follows by the laws of both, that the lands which either\r\npossessed, within the jurisdiction of the other, became the property of\r\nthe State in which they are. But a question arises, whether the transfer\r\nof the property took place on the Declaration of Independence, or not\r\ntill an office, or an act of Assembly, had declared the transfer. If the\r\nproperty passed to the State on the Declaration of Independence, then\r\nit did not remain in General Oglethorpe, and, of course, at the time of\r\nhis death, he having nothing, there was nothing to pass to his heirs,\r\nand so, nothing for the treaty to operate on.\r\n\r\n3. If the property does not pass till declared by an office found by\r\njury, or an act passed by the Assembly, the question then is, whether\r\nan office had been found, or an act of Assembly been passed for that\r\npurpose, before the peace? If there was, the lands had passed to the\r\nState during his life, and nothing being left in him, there is nothing\r\nfor his heirs to claim under the treaty.\r\n\r\n4. If the property had not been transferred to the State before the\r\npeace, either by the Declaration of Independence, or an office, or an act\r\nof Assembly, then it remained in General Oglethorpe at the epoch of the\r\npeace; and it will be insisted, no doubt, that, by the sixth article of\r\nthe treaty of peace, between the United States and Great Britain, which\r\nforbids future confiscations, General Oglethorpe acquired a capacity of\r\nholding and of conveying his lands. He has conveyed them to his wife.\r\nBut she being an alien, it will be decided by the laws of the land,\r\nwhether she took them for her own use, or for the use of the State. For\r\nit is a general principle of our law, that conveyances to aliens pass\r\nthe lands to the State; and it may be urged, that though, by the treaty\r\nof peace, General Oglethorpe could convey, yet that treaty did not mean\r\nto give him a greater privilege of conveyance than natives hold, to wit:\r\na privilege of transferring the property to persons incapable, by law,\r\nof taking it. However, this would be a question between the State of\r\nGeorgia and the widow of General Oglethorpe, in the decision of which\r\nthe Chevalier de Mezieres is not interested, because, whether she takes\r\nthe land by the will, for her own use, or for that of the State, it is\r\nequally prevented from descending to him: there is neither a conveyance\r\nto him, nor a succession _ab intestato_ devolving on him, which are the\r\ncases provided for by our treaty with France. To sum up the matter in\r\na few words; if the lands had passed to the State before the epoch of\r\npeace, the heirs of General Oglethorpe cannot say they have descended\r\non them, and if they remained in the General at that epoch, the treaty\r\nsaving them to him, he could convey them away from his heirs, and he\r\nhas conveyed them to his widow, either for her own use, or for that of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nSeeing no event in which, according to the facts stated to me, the treaty\r\ncould be applied to this case, or could give any right whatever, to the\r\nheirs of General Oglethorpe, I advised the Chevalier de Mezieres not to\r\nurge his pretensions on the footing of right, nor under the treaty, but\r\nto petition the Assembly of Georgia for a grant of these lands. If, in\r\nthe question between the State and the widow of General Oglethorpe, it\r\nshould be decided that they were the property of the State, I expected\r\nfrom their generosity, and the friendly disposition in America towards\r\nthe subjects of France, that they would be favorable to the Chevalier\r\nde Mezieres. There is nothing in the preceding observations which would\r\nnot have applied against the heir of General Oglethorpe, had he been a\r\nnative citizen of Georgia, as it now applies against him, being a subject\r\nof France. The treaty has placed the subjects of France on a footing\r\nwith natives, as to conveyances and descent of property. There was no\r\noccasion for the Assemblies to pass laws on this subject; the treaty\r\nbeing a law, as I conceive, superior to those of particular Assemblies,\r\nand repealing them, when they stand in the way of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that the treaty was disregarded on our part, in the\r\ninstance of the acts of Assembly of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, which\r\nmade a distinction between natives and foreigners, as to the duties to\r\nbe paid on commerce, was taken notice of in the letter of November the\r\n20th, which I had the honor of addressing to the Count de Vergennes. And\r\nwhile I express my hopes that, on a revision of these subjects, nothing\r\nwill be found in them derogatory from either the letter or spirit of our\r\ntreaty, I will add assurances that the United States will not be behind\r\nhand in going beyond both, whenever occasions shall offer of manifesting\r\ntheir sincere attachment to this country.\r\n\r\nI will pass on to the observation, that our commercial regulations\r\nare difficult, and repugnant to the French merchants. To detail these\r\nregulations minutely, as they exist in every State, would be beyond my\r\ninformation. A general view of them, however, will suffice, because the\r\nStates differ little in their several regulations. On the arrival of a\r\nship in America, her cargo must be reported at the proper office. The\r\nduties on it are to be paid. These are commonly from two and a half to\r\nfive per cent. on its value. On many articles, the value of which is\r\ntolerably uniform, the precise sum is fixed by law. A tariff of these is\r\npresented to the importer, and he can see what he has to pay, as well\r\nas the officer. For other articles, the duty is such a per cent. on\r\ntheir value. That value is either shown by the invoice, or by the oath\r\nof the importer. This operation being once over, and it is a very short\r\none, the goods are considered as entered, and may then pass through\r\nthe whole thirteen States without their being ever more subject to a\r\nquestion, unless they be reshipped. Exportation is still more simple;\r\nbecause, as we prohibit the exportation of nothing, and very rarely\r\nlay a duty on any article of export, the State is little interested in\r\nexamining outward-bound vessels. The captain asks a clearance for his\r\nown purposes. As to the operations of internal commerce, such as matters\r\nof exchange, of buying, selling, bartering, &c., our laws are the same\r\nas the English. If they have been altered in any instance, it has been\r\nto render them more simple.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to the tardiness of the administration of justice with us,\r\nit would be equally tedious and impracticable for me to give a precise\r\naccount of it in every State. But I think it probable that it is much\r\non the same footing through all the States, and that an account of it\r\nin any one of them may found a general presumption of it in the others.\r\nBeing best acquainted with its administration in Virginia, I shall\r\nconfine myself to that. Before the Revolution, a judgment could not be\r\nobtained under eight years in the supreme court, where the suit was\r\nin the department of the common law, which department embraces about\r\nnine-tenths of the subject of legal contestation. In that of the chancery,\r\nfrom twelve to twenty years were requisite. This did not proceed from\r\nany vice in the laws, but from the indolence of the judges appointed by\r\nthe King; and these judges holding their office during his will only, he\r\ncould have reformed the evil at any time. This reformation was among the\r\nfirst works of the legislature after our independence. A judgment can\r\nnow be obtained in the supreme court in one year at the common law, and\r\nin about three years in the chancery. But more particularly to protect\r\nthe commerce of France, which, at that moment, was considerable with us,\r\na law was passed, giving all suits wherein a foreigner was a party, a\r\nprivilege to be tried immediately, on the return of his process, without\r\nwaiting till those of natives, which stand before them, shall have been\r\ndecided on. Out of this act, however, the British stand excluded by a\r\nsubsequent one. This, with its causes, must be explained. The British\r\narmy, after ravaging the State of Virginia, had sent off a very great\r\nnumber of slaves to New York. By the seventh article of the treaty of\r\npeace, they stipulated not to carry away any of these. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, it was known, when they were evacuating New York, that they were\r\ncarrying away the slaves. General Washington made an official demand of\r\nSir Guy Carleton, that he should cease to send them away. He answered,\r\nthat these people had come to them under promise of the King's protection,\r\nand that that promise should be fulfilled in preference to the stipulation\r\nin the treaty. The State of Virginia, to which nearly the whole of these\r\nslaves belonged, passed a law to forbid the recovery of debts due to\r\nBritish subjects. They declared, at the same time, they would repeal\r\nthe law, if Congress were of opinion they ought to do it. But, desirous\r\nthat their citizens should be discharging their debts, they afterwards\r\npermitted British creditors to prosecute their suits, and to receive\r\ntheir debts in seven equal and annual payments; relying that the demand\r\nfor the slaves would be either admitted or denied in time to lay their\r\nhands on some of the latter payments for reimbursement. The immensity of\r\nthis debt was another reason for forbidding such a mass of property to\r\nbe offered for sale under execution at once, as, from the small quantity\r\nof circulating money, it must have sold for little or nothing, whereby\r\nthe creditor would have failed to receive his money, and the debtor would\r\nhave lost his whole estate without being discharged of his debt. This\r\nis the history of the delay of justice in that country in the case of\r\nBritish creditors. As to all others, its administration is as speedy as\r\njustice itself will admit. I presume it is equally so in all the other\r\nStates, and can add, that it is administered in them all, with a purity\r\nand integrity of which few counties afford an example.\r\n\r\nI cannot take leave altogether of the subjects of this conversation\r\nwithout recalling the attention of the Count de Vergennes to what had\r\nbeen its principal drift. This was to endeavor to bring about a direct\r\nexchange between France and the United States (without the intervention\r\nof a third nation), of those productions with which each could furnish\r\nthe other. We can furnish to France (because we have heretofore furnished\r\nto England), of whale oil and spermaceti, of furs and peltry, of ships\r\nand naval stores, and of potash, to the amount of fifteen millions of\r\nlivres; and the quantities will admit of increase. Of our tobacco, France\r\nconsumes the value of ten millions more. Twenty-five millions of livres,\r\nthen, mark the extent of that commerce of exchange, which is, at present,\r\npracticable between us. We want, in return, productions and manufactures,\r\nnot money. If the duties on our produce are light, and the sale free,\r\nwe shall undoubtedly bring it here, and lay out the proceeds on the\r\nspot in the productions and manufactures which we want. The merchants of\r\nFrance will, on their part, become active in the same business. We shall\r\nno more think, when we shall have sold our produce here, of making an\r\nuseless voyage to another country to lay out the money, than we think\r\nat present, when we have sold it elsewhere, of coming here to lay out\r\nthe money. The conclusion is, that there are commodities which form a\r\nbasis of exchange to the extent of a million of guineas annually; it is\r\nfor the wisdom of those in power to contrive that the exchange shall be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nHaving put this paper into the hands of Monsieur Reyneval, we entered\r\ninto conversation again, on the subject of the Farms, which were now\r\nunderstood to be approaching to a conclusion. He told me, that he was\r\ndecidedly of opinion, that the interest of the State required the Farm\r\nof tobacco to be discontinued, and that he had, accordingly, given every\r\naid to my proposition, which laid within his sphere; that the Count\r\nde Vergennes was very clearly of the same opinion, and had supported\r\nit strongly with reasons of his own, when he transmitted it to the\r\nComptroller General; but that the Comptroller, in the discussions of\r\nthis subject which had taken place, besides the objections which the\r\nCount de Vergennes had repeated to me, and which are before mentioned,\r\nhad added, that the contract with the Farmers General was now so far\r\nadvanced, that the article of tobacco could not be withdrawn from it,\r\nwithout unravelling the whole transaction. Having understood that, in this\r\ncontract, there was always reserved to the crown a right to discontinue\r\nit at any moment, making just reimbursements to the Farmers, I asked\r\nM. Reyneval, if the contract should be concluded in its present form,\r\nwhether it might still be practicable to have it discontinued, as to the\r\narticle of tobacco, at some future moment. He said it might be possible.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the true obstacle to this proposition has penetrated,\r\nin various ways, through the veil which covers it. The influence of the\r\nFarmers General has been heretofore found sufficient to shake a minister\r\nin his office. Monsieur de Calonnes' continuance or dismission, has been\r\nthought, for some time, to be on a poise. Were he to shift this great\r\nweight, therefore, out of his own scale into that of his adversaries,\r\nit would decide their preponderance. The joint interests of France and\r\nAmerica would be insufficient counterpoise in his favor.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these efforts to improve the commerce of the\r\nUnited States, have been confined to that branch only which respects\r\nFrance itself, and that nothing passed on the subject of our commerce\r\nwith the West Indies, except an incidental conversation as to our fish.\r\nThe reason of this, was no want of a due sense of its importance. Of\r\nthat, I am thoroughly sensible. But efforts in favor of this branch\r\nwould, at present, be desperate. To nations with which we have not yet\r\ntreated, and who have possessions in America, we may offer a free vent\r\nof their manufactures in the United States, for a full or modified\r\nadmittance into those possessions. But to France, we are obliged to\r\ngive that freedom for a different compensation; to wit, for her aid in\r\neffecting our independence. It is difficult, therefore, to say what we\r\nhave now to offer her, for an admission into her West Indies. Doubtless,\r\nit has its price. But the question is, what this would be, and whether\r\nworth our while to give it. Were we to propose to give to each other's\r\ncitizens all the rights of natives, they would, of course, count what\r\nthey should gain by this enlargement of right, and examine whether it\r\nwould be worth to them as much as their monopoly of their West India\r\ncommerce. If not, that commercial freedom which we wish to preserve, and\r\nwhich, indeed, is so valuable, leaves us little to offer. An expression\r\nin my letter to the Count de Vergennes, of November the 20th, wherein\r\nI hinted that both nations might, perhaps, come into the opinion, that\r\nthe condition of _natives_ might be a better ground of intercourse for\r\ntheir citizens, than that of the _most favored_ nation, was intended\r\nto furnish an opportunity to the minister of parleying on that subject,\r\nif he was so disposed, and to myself, of seeing whereabouts they would\r\nbegin, that I might communicate it to Congress, and leave them to judge of\r\nthe expediency of pursuing the subject. But no overtures have followed;\r\nfor I have no right to consider as coming from the minister, certain\r\nquestions which were, very soon after, proposed to me by an individual.\r\nIt sufficiently accounts for these questions, that that individual had\r\nwritten a memorial on the subject, for the consideration of the minister,\r\nand might wish to know what we would be willing to do. The idea that I\r\nshould answer such questions to him, is equally unaccountable, whether we\r\nsuppose them originating with himself, or coming from the minister. In\r\nfact, I must suppose them to be his own; and I transmit them, only that\r\nCongress may see what one Frenchman, at least, thinks on the subject.\r\nIf we can obtain from Great Britain reasonable conditions of commerce,\r\n(which, in my idea, must forever include an admission into her islands,)\r\nthe freest ground between these two nations would seem to be the best.\r\nBut if we can obtain no equal terms from her, perhaps Congress might\r\nthink it prudent, as Holland has done, to connect us unequivocally with\r\nFrance. Holland has purchased the protection of France. The price she\r\npays, is _aid in time of war_. It is interesting for us to purchase a\r\nfree commerce with the French islands. But whether it is best to pay for\r\nit, by _aids in war, or by privileges in commerce, or not to purchase\r\nit at all_, is the question.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [14]\r\n\r\n     TO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                          PARIS, January 2d, 1786.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--Several conferences and letters having passed\r\n     between the Count de Vergennes and myself, on the subject\r\n     of the commerce of this country with the United States,\r\n     I think them sufficiently interesting to be communicated\r\n     to Congress.

Yet I have not been able to abridge it,\r\n     without omitting circumstances which I thought Congress\r\n     would rather choose to know.

What has led Congress to determine, that the concurrence of seven votes\r\nis requisite in questions which, by the Confederation, are submitted to\r\nthe decision of a majority of the United States, in Congress assembled?\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of Confederation, section six, evidently establishes\r\nthree orders of questions in Congress. 1. The greater ones, which\r\nrelate to making peace or war, alliances, coinage, requisitions for\r\nmoney, raising military force, or appointing its commander-in-chief.\r\n2. The lesser ones, which comprehend all other matters submitted by the\r\nConfederation to the federal head. 3. The single question of adjourning\r\nfrom day to day. This gradation of questions is distinctly characterized\r\nby the article.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the magnitude of these questions, a greater concurrence\r\nof the voices composing the Union was thought necessary. Three degrees\r\nof concurrence, well distinguished by substantial circumstances, offered\r\nthemselves to notice. 1. A concurrence of a _majority of the people_ of\r\nthe Union. It was thought that this would be insured, by requiring the\r\nvoices of nine States; because, according to the loose estimates which\r\nhad been made of the inhabitants, and the proportion of them which were\r\nfree, it was believed that even the nine smallest would include a majority\r\nof the free citizens of the Union. The voices, therefore, of nine States\r\nwere required in the greater questions. 2. A concurrence of the _majority\r\nof the States_. Seven constitute that majority. This number, therefore,\r\nwas required in the lesser questions. 3. A concurrence of the _majority\r\nof Congress_, that is to say, of the States actually present in it. As\r\nthere is no Congress, when there are not seven States present, this\r\nconcurrence could never be of less than four States. But these might\r\nhappen to be the four smallest, which would not include one-ninth part\r\nof the free citizens of the Union. This kind of majority, therefore,\r\nwas entrusted with nothing but the power of adjourning themselves from\r\nday to day.\r\n\r\nHere then are three kind of majorities. 1. Of the people. 2. Of the\r\nStates. 3. Of the Congress: each of which is entrusted to a certain\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThough the paragraph in question be clumsily expressed, yet it strictly\r\nannounces its own intentions. It defines with precision, the _greater_\r\nquestions, for which nine votes shall be requisite. In the _lesser_\r\nquestions, it then requires a _majority of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled_: a term which will apply either to the number seven, as being\r\na _majority of the States_, or to the number four as being a _majority\r\nof Congress_. Which of the two kinds of majority, was meant? Clearly,\r\nthat which would leave a still smaller kind, for the decision of the\r\nquestion of adjournment. The contrary construction would be absurd.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph, therefore, should be understood, as if it had been\r\nexpressed in the following terms: \"The United States, in Congress\r\nassembled, shall never engage in war, &c., but with the consent of nine\r\nStates: nor determine any other question, but with the consent of a\r\nmajority of the whole States, except the question of adjournment from\r\nday to day, which may be determined by a majority of the States actually\r\npresent in Congress.\"\r\n\r\n2. How far is it permitted, to bring on the reconsideration of a question\r\nwhich Congress has once determined?\r\n\r\nThe first Congress which met, being composed mostly of persons who had\r\nbeen members of the legislatures of their respective States, it was\r\nnatural for them to adopt those rules in their proceedings, to which\r\nthey had been accustomed in their legislative houses; and the more so,\r\nas these happened to be nearly the same, as having been copied from the\r\nsame original, those of the British parliament. One of those rules of\r\nproceeding was, that \"a question once determined, cannot be proposed, a\r\nsecond time, in the same session.\" Congress, during their first session,\r\nin the autumn of 1774, observed this rule strictly. But before their\r\nmeeting in the spring of the following year, the war had broken out.\r\nThey found themselves at the head of that war, in an executive as well\r\nas legislative capacity. They found that a rule, wise and necessary for\r\na legislative body, did not suit an executive one, which, being governed\r\nby events, must change their purposes as those change. Besides, their\r\nsession was then to become of equal duration with the war; and a rule,\r\nwhich should render their legislation immutable, during all that period,\r\ncould not be submitted to. They, therefore, renounced it in practice,\r\nand have ever since continued to reconsider their questions freely.\r\nThe only restraint as yet provided against the abuse of this permission\r\nto reconsider, is, that when a question has been decided, it cannot be\r\nproposed for reconsideration, but by some one who voted in favor of the\r\nformer decision, and declares that he has since changed his opinion.\r\nI do not recollect accurately enough, whether it be necessary that his\r\nvote should have decided that of his State, and the vote of his State\r\nhave decided that of Congress.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might have been better, when they were forming the federal\r\nconstitution, to have assimilated it, as much as possible, to the\r\nparticular constitutions of the States. All of these have distributed the\r\nlegislative, executive and judiciary powers, into different departments.\r\nIn the federal constitution, the judiciary powers are separated from the\r\nothers; but the legislative and executive are both exercised by Congress.\r\nA means of amending this defect has been thought of. Congress having a\r\npower to establish what committees of their own body they please, and to\r\narrange among them the distribution of their business, they might, on\r\nthe first day of their annual meeting, appoint an executive committee,\r\nconsisting of a member from each State, and refer to them all executive\r\nbusiness which should occur during their session; confining themselves to\r\nwhat is of a legislative nature, that is to say, to the heads described\r\nin the ninth article, as of the competence of nine States only, and to\r\nsuch other questions as should lead to the establishment of general\r\nrules. The journal of this committee, of the preceding day, might be\r\nread the next morning in Congress, and considered as approved, unless a\r\nvote was demanded on a particular article, and that article changed. The\r\nsessions of Congress would then be short, and when they separated, the\r\nConfederation authorizes the appointment of a committee of the States,\r\nwhich would naturally succeed to the business of the executive committee.\r\nThe legislative business would be better done, because the attention of\r\nthe members would not be interrupted by the details of execution; and\r\nthe executive business would be better done, because, business of this\r\nnature is better adapted to small, than great bodies. A monarchical head\r\nshould confide the execution of its will to departments, consisting, each,\r\nof a plurality of hands, who would warp that will, as much as possible,\r\ntowards wisdom and moderation, the two qualities it generally wants.\r\nBut, a republican head, founding its decrees, originally, in these two\r\nqualities, should commit them to a single hand for execution, giving\r\nthem, thereby, a promptitude which republican proceedings generally\r\nwant. Congress could not, indeed, confide their executive business to a\r\nsmaller number than a committee consisting of a member from each State.\r\nThis is necessary to insure the confidence of the Union. But it would\r\nbe gaining a great deal, to reduce the executive head to thirteen, and\r\nto relieve themselves of those details. This, however, has as yet been\r\nthe subject of private conversations only.\r\n\r\n3. A succinct account of paper money in America?\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Revolution, most of the States were in the habit, whenever\r\nthey had occasion for more money than could be raised immediately by\r\ntaxes, to issue paper notes or bills, in the name of the State, wherein\r\nthey promised to pay to the bearer the sum named in the note or bill. In\r\nsome of the States no time of payment was fixed, nor tax laid to enable\r\npayment. In these, the bills depreciated. But others of the States named\r\nin the bill the day when it should be paid, laid taxes to bring in money\r\nenough for that purpose, and paid the bills punctually, on or before the\r\nday named. In these States, paper money was in as high estimation as gold\r\nand silver. On the commencement of the late Revolution, Congress had no\r\nmoney. The external commerce of the States being suppressed, the farmer\r\ncould not sell his produce, and, of course, could not pay a tax. Congress\r\nhad no resource then but in paper money. Not being able to lay a tax for\r\nits redemption, they could only promise that taxes should be laid for\r\nthat purpose, so as to redeem the bills by a certain day. They did not\r\nforesee the long continuance of the war, the almost total suppression of\r\ntheir exports, and other events, which rendered the performance of their\r\nengagement impossible. The paper money continued for a twelvemonth equal\r\nto gold and silver. But the quantities which they were obliged to emit\r\nfor the purpose of the war, exceeded what had been the usual quantity\r\nof the circulating medium. It began, therefore, to become cheaper, or,\r\nas we expressed it, it depreciated, as gold and silver would have done,\r\nhad they been thrown into circulation in equal quantities. But not\r\nhaving, like them, an intrinsic value, its depreciation was more rapid\r\nand greater than could ever have happened with them. In two years, it\r\nhad fallen to two dollars of paper money for one of silver; in three\r\nyears, to four for one; in nine months more, it fell to ten for one; and\r\nin the six months following, that is to say, by September, 1779, it had\r\nfallen to twenty for one.\r\n\r\nCongress, alarmed at the consequences which were to be apprehended,\r\nshould they lose this resource altogether, thought it necessary to\r\nmake a vigorous effort to stop its further depreciation. They therefore\r\ndetermined, in the first place, that their emissions should not exceed\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars, to which term they were then nearly\r\narrived; and though they knew that twenty dollars of what they were\r\nthen issuing, would buy no more for their army than one silver dollar\r\nwould buy, yet they thought it would be worth while to submit to the\r\nsacrifice of nineteen out of twenty dollars, if they could thereby stop\r\nfurther depreciation. They, therefore, published an address to their\r\nconstituents, in which they renewed their original declarations, that\r\nthis paper money should be redeemed at dollar for dollar. They proved\r\nthe ability of the States to do this, and that their liberty would be\r\ncheaply bought at that price. The declaration was ineffectual. No man\r\nreceived the money at a better rate; on the contrary, in six months more,\r\nthat is, by March, 1780, it had fallen to forty for one. Congress then\r\ntried an experiment of a different kind. Considering their former offers\r\nto redeem this money at par, as relinquished by the general refusal to\r\ntake it, but in progressive depreciation, they required the whole to\r\nbe brought in, declared it should be redeemed at its present value, of\r\nforty for one, and that they would give to the holders new bills, reduced\r\nin their denomination to the sum of gold or silver, which was actually\r\nto be paid for them. This would reduce the nominal sum of the mass in\r\ncirculation to the present worth of that mass, which was five millions;\r\na sum not too great for the circulation of the States, and which, they\r\ntherefore hoped, would not depreciate further, as they continued firm\r\nin their purpose of emitting no more. This effort was as unavailing as\r\nthe former. Very little of the money was brought in. It continued to\r\ncirculate and to depreciate, till the end of 1780, when it had fallen\r\nto seventy-five for one, and the money circulated from the French army,\r\nbeing, by that time, sensible in all the States north of the Potomac,\r\nthe paper ceased its circulation altogether in those States. In Virginia\r\nand North Carolina it continued a year longer, within which time it fell\r\nto one thousand for one, and then expired, as it had done in the other\r\nStates, without a single groan. Not a murmur was heard on this occasion,\r\namong the people. On the contrary, universal congratulations took place\r\non their seeing this gigantic mass, whose dissolution had threatened\r\nconvulsions which should shake their infant confederacy to its centre,\r\nquietly interred in its grave. Foreigners, indeed, who do not, like\r\nthe natives, feel indulgence for its memory, as of a being which has\r\nvindicated their liberties, and fallen in the moment of victory, have\r\nbeen loud, and still are loud in their complaints. A few of them have\r\nreason; but the most noisy are not the best of them. They are persons\r\nwho have become bankrupt by unskilful attempts at commerce with America.\r\nThat they may have some pretext to offer to their creditors, they have\r\nbought up great masses of this dead money in America, where it is to be\r\nhad at five thousand for one, and they show the certificates of their\r\npaper possessions, as if they had all died in their hands, and had been\r\nthe cause of their bankruptcy. Justice will be done to all, by paying\r\nto all persons what this money actually cost them, with an interest of\r\nsix per cent. from the time they received it. If difficulties present\r\nthemselves in the ascertaining the epoch of the receipt, it has been\r\nthought better that the State should lose, by admitting easy proofs,\r\nthan that individuals, and especially foreigners, should, by being held\r\nto such as would be difficult, perhaps impossible.\r\n\r\n4. Virginia certainly owed two millions sterling to Great Britain at\r\nthe conclusion of the war. Some have conjectured the debt as high as\r\nthree millions. I think that State owed near as much as all the rest put\r\ntogether. This is to be ascribed to peculiarities in the tobacco trade.\r\nThe advantages made by the British merchants, on the tobaccos consigned\r\nto them, were so enormous, that they spared no means of increasing those\r\nconsignments. A powerful engine for this purpose, was the giving good\r\nprices and credit to the planter, till they got him more immersed in debt\r\nthan he could pay, without selling his lands or slaves. They then reduced\r\nthe prices given for his tobacco, so that let his shipments be ever\r\nso great, and his demand of necessaries ever so economical, they never\r\npermitted him to clear off his debt, These debts had become hereditary\r\nfrom father to son, for many generations, so that the planters were a\r\nspecies of property, annexed to certain mercantile houses in London.\r\n\r\n5. The members of Congress are differently paid by different States.\r\nSome are on fixed allowances, from four to eight dollars a day. Others\r\nhave their expenses paid, and a surplus for their time. This surplus is\r\nof two, three, or four dollars a day.\r\n\r\n6. I do not believe there has ever been a moment, when a single whig, in\r\nany one State, would not have shuddered at the very idea of a separation\r\nof their State from the confederacy. The tories would, at all times,\r\nhave been glad to see the confederacy dissolved, even by particles at\r\na time, in hopes of their attaching themselves again to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n7. The 11th article of Confederation admits Canada to accede to the\r\nConfederation at its own will, but adds, \"no other colony shall be\r\nadmitted to the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\"\r\nWhen the plan of April, 1784, for establishing new States was on the\r\ncarpet, the committee who framed the report of that plan, had inserted\r\nthis clause, \"provided nine States agree to such admission, according to\r\nthe reservation of the 11th of the articles of Confederation.\" It was\r\nobjected, 1. That the words of the confederation, \"no other colony,\"\r\ncould refer only to the residuary possessions of Great Britain, as the\r\ntwo Floridas, Nova Scotia, &c., not being already parts of the Union;\r\nthat the law for \"admitting\" a new member into the Union, could not be\r\napplied to a territory which was already in the Union, as making part of\r\na State which was a member of it. 2. That it would be improper to allow\r\n\"nine\" States to receive a new member, because the same reasons which\r\nrendered that number proper now, would render a greater one proper, when\r\nthe number composing the Union should be increased. They therefore struck\r\nout this paragraph and inserted a proviso, that \"the consent of so many\r\nStates, in Congress, shall be first obtained, as may, at the time, be\r\ncompetent;\" thus leaving the question, whether the 11th article applies to\r\nthe admission of new States, to be decided when that admission shall be\r\nasked. See the Journal of Congress of April 20, 1784. Another doubt was\r\nstarted in this debate, viz.: whether the agreement of the nine States,\r\nrequired by the Confederation, was to be made by their legislatures, or\r\nby their delegates in Congress? The expression adopted, viz.: \"so many\r\nStates, in Congress, is first obtained,\" show what was their sense of\r\nthis matter. If it be agreed that the 11th article of the Confederation\r\nis not to be applied to the admission of these new States, then it is\r\ncontended that their admission comes within the 13th article, which\r\nforbids \"any alteration, unless agreed to in a Congress of the United\r\nStates, and afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.\"\r\nThe independence of the new States of Kentucky and Franklin, will soon\r\nbring on the ultimate decision of all these questions.\r\n\r\n8. Particular instances whereby the General Assembly of Virginia have\r\nshown that they considered the ordinance called their constitution, as\r\nevery other ordinance, or act of the legislature, subject to be altered\r\nby the legislature for the time being.\r\n\r\n1. The convention which formed that constitution, declared themselves to\r\nbe the House of Delegates, during the term for which they were originally\r\nelected, and in the autumn of the year met the Senate, elected under\r\nthe new constitution, and did legislative business with them. At this\r\ntime, there were malefactors in the public jail, and there was as yet no\r\ncourt established for their trial. They passed a law, appointing certain\r\nmembers by name, who were then members of the Executive Council, to\r\nbe a court for the trial of these malefactors, though the constitution\r\nhad said, in express words, that no person should exercise the powers\r\nof more than one of the three departments, legislative, executive and\r\njudiciary at the same time. This proves that the very men who had made\r\nthat constitution understood that it would be alterable by the General\r\nAssembly. This court was only for that occasion. When the next General\r\nAssembly met, after the election of the ensuing year, there was a new\r\nset of malefactors in the jail, and no court to try them. This Assembly\r\npassed a similar law to the former, appointing certain members of the\r\nExecutive Council to be an occasional court for this particular case.\r\nNot having the journals of Assembly by me, I am unable to say whether\r\nthis measure was repealed afterwards. However, they are instances of\r\n_executive_ and _judiciary_ powers exercised by the same persons, under\r\nthe authority of a law, made in contradiction to the constitution.\r\n\r\n2. There was a process depending in the ordinary courts of justice,\r\nbetween two individuals of the names of Robinson and Fauntleroy, who\r\nwere relations, of different descriptions, to one Robinson, a British\r\nsubject, lately dead. Each party claimed a right to inherit the lands of\r\nthe decedent according to the laws. Their right should by the constitution\r\nhave been decided by the judiciary courts; and it was actually depending\r\nbefore them. One of the parties petitioned the Assembly (I think it was\r\nin the year 1782), who passed a law deciding the right in his favor. In\r\nthe following year, a Frenchman, master of a vessel, entered into port\r\nwithout complying with the laws established in such cases, whereby he\r\nincurred the forfeitures of the law to any person who would sue for them.\r\nAn individual instituted a legal process to recover these forfeitures\r\naccording to the law of the land. The Frenchman petitioned the Assembly,\r\nwho passed a law deciding the question of forfeiture in his favor. These\r\nacts are occasional repeals of that part of the constitution which forbids\r\nthe same persons to exercise _legislative_ and _judiciary_ powers at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly is in the habitual exercise, during their sessions, of\r\ndirecting the Executive what to do. There are few pages of their journals\r\nwhich do not show proofs of this, and consequently instances of the\r\n_legislative_ and _executive_ powers exercised by the same persons at\r\nthe same time. These things prove that it has been the uninterrupted\r\nopinion of every Assembly, from that which passed the ordinance called\r\nthe constitution down to the present day, that their acts may control\r\nthat ordinance, and, of course, that the State of Virginia has no fixed\r\nconstitution at all.\r\n\r\n     [The succeeding observations were made by Mr. Jefferson on an\r\n     article entitled \"Etats Unis,\" prepared for the Encyclopedie\r\n     Methodique, and submitted to him before its publication.]\r\n\r\nPage 8. The malefactors sent to America were not sufficient in number to\r\nmerit enumeration, as one class out of three which peopled America. It\r\nwas at a late period of their history that this practice began. I have no\r\nbook by me which enables me to point out the date of its commencement.\r\nBut I do not think the whole number sent would amount to two thousand,\r\nand being principally men, eaten up with disease, they married seldom and\r\npropagated little. I do not suppose that themselves and their descendants\r\nare at present four thousand, which is little more than one thousandth\r\npart of the whole inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIndented servants formed a considerable supply. These were poor Europeans,\r\nwho went to America to settle themselves. If they could pay their passage,\r\nit was well. If not, they must find means of paying it. They were at\r\nliberty, therefore, to make an agreement with any person they chose,\r\nto serve him such a length of time as they agreed on, upon condition\r\nthat he would repay to the master of the vessel the expenses of their\r\npassage. If, being foreigners, unable to speak the language, they did\r\nnot know how to make a bargain for themselves, the captain of the vessel\r\ncontracted for them with such persons as he could. This contract was by\r\ndeed indented, which occasioned them to be called indented servants.\r\nSometimes they were called redemptioners, because by their agreement\r\nwith the master of the vessel, they could _redeem_ themselves from his\r\npower by paying their passage, which they frequently effected by hiring\r\nthemselves on their arrival, as is before mentioned. In some States I\r\nknow that these people had a right of marrying themselves without their\r\nmaster's leave, and I did suppose they had that right everywhere. I did\r\nnot know that in any of the States they demanded so much as a week for\r\nevery day's absence without leave. I suspect this must have been at a\r\nvery early period, while the governments were in the hands of the first\r\nemigrants, who, being mostly laborers, were narrow-minded and severe. I\r\nknow that in Virginia the laws allowed their servitude to be protracted\r\nonly two days for every one they were absent without leave. So mild was\r\nthis kind of servitude, that it was very frequent for foreigners, who\r\ncarried to America money enough not only to pay their passage, but to\r\nbuy themselves a farm, to indent themselves to a master for three years\r\nfor a certain sum of money, with a view to learn the husbandry of the\r\ncountry. I will here make a general observation. So desirous are the poor\r\nof Europe to get to America, where they may better their condition, that\r\nbeing unable to pay their passage, they will agree to serve two or three\r\nyears on their arrival here, rather than not go. During the time of that\r\nservice, they are better fed, better clothed, and have lighter labor,\r\nthan while in Europe. Continuing to work for hire a few years longer,\r\nthey buy a farm, marry, and enjoy all the sweets of a domestic society\r\nof their own. The American governments are censured for permitting this\r\nspecies of servitude, which lays the foundation of the happiness of\r\nthese people. But what should these governments do? Pay the passage of\r\nall those who choose to go into their country? They are not able; nor\r\nwere they able, do they think the purchase worth the price? Should they\r\nexclude these people from their shores? Those who know their situations\r\nin Europe and America, would not say that this is the alternative which\r\nhumanity dictates. It is said that these people are deceived by those\r\nwho carry them over. But this is done in Europe. How can the American\r\ngovernments prevent it? Should they punish the deceiver? It seems more\r\nincumbent on the European government, where the act is done, and where a\r\npublic injury is sustained from it. However, it is only in Europe that\r\nthis deception is heard of. The individuals are generally satisfied in\r\nAmerica with their adventure, and very few of them wish not to have made\r\nit. I must add that the Congress have nothing to do with this matter.\r\nIt belongs to the legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\nPage 26. \"Une puissance, en effet,\" &c. The account of the settlement of\r\nthe colonies, which precedes this paragraph, shows that that settlement\r\nwas not made by public authority, or at the public expense of England;\r\nbut by the exertions, and at the expense of individuals. Hence it\r\nhappened, that their constitutions were not formed systematically, but\r\naccording to the circumstances which happened to exist in each. Hence,\r\ntoo, the principles of the political connection between the old and new\r\ncountries, were never settled. That it would have been advantageous to\r\nhave settled them, is certain; and, particularly, to have provided a body\r\nwhich should decide, in the last resort, all cases wherein both parties\r\nwere interested. But it is not certain that that right would have been\r\ngiven, or ought to have been given to the Parliament; much less, that it\r\nresulted to the Parliament, without having been given to it expressly.\r\nWhy was it necessary that there should have been a body to decide in the\r\nlast resort? Because, it would have been for the good of both parties.\r\nBut this reason shows it ought not to have been the Parliament, since\r\nthat would have exercised it for the good of one party only.\r\n\r\nPage 105. As to the change of the 8th article of Confederation, for\r\nquoting requisitions of money on the States.\r\n\r\nBy a report of the Secretary of Congress, dated January the 4th, 1786,\r\neight States had then acceded to the proposition; to wit, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand North Carolina.\r\n\r\nCongress, on the 18th of April, 1783, recommended to the States to invest\r\nthem with a power, for twenty-five years, to levy an impost of five per\r\ncent. on all articles imported from abroad. New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nand South Carolina, had complied with this, before the 4th of January,\r\n1786. Maryland had passed an act for the same purpose; but, by a mistake\r\nin referring to the date of the recommendation of Congress, the act\r\nfailed of its effect. This was therefore to be rectified. Since the 4th\r\nof January, the public papers tell us that Rhode Island has complied\r\nfully with this recommendation.\r\n\r\nIt remains still for New York and Georgia to do it. The exportations\r\nof America, which are tolerably well known, are the best measure for\r\nestimating the importations. These are probably worth about twenty\r\nmillions of dollars, annually. Of course, this impost will pay the\r\ninterest of a debt to that amount. If confined to the foreign debt,\r\nit will pay the whole interest of that, and sink half a million of the\r\ncapital, annually. The expenses of collecting this impost, will probably\r\nbe six per cent. on its amount, this being the usual expense of collection\r\nin the United States. This will be sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1784, Congress recommended to the States, to invest\r\nthem with a power, for fifteen years, to exclude from their ports the\r\nvessels of all nations, not having a treaty of commerce with them; and\r\nto pass, as to all nations, an act on the principles of the British\r\nnavigation act. Not that they were disposed to carry these powers into\r\nexecution, with such as would meet them in fair and equal arrangements\r\nof commerce; but that they might be able to do it against those who\r\nshould not. On the 4th of January, 1786, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand North Carolina, had done it. It remained for New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia, to do the same.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the general idea has advanced before the demands of\r\nCongress, and several States have passed acts, for vesting Congress with\r\nthe whole regulation of their commerce, reserving the revenue arising\r\nfrom these regulations, to the disposal of the State in which it is\r\nlevied. The States which, according to the public papers, have passed\r\nsuch acts, are New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware, and Virginia; but the Assembly of Virginia, apprehensive that\r\nthis disjointed method of proceeding may fail in its effect, or be much\r\nretarded, passed a resolution on the 21st of January, 1786, appointing\r\ncommissioners to meet others from the other States, whom they invite into\r\nthe same measure, to digest the form of an act, for investing Congress\r\nwith such powers over their commerce, as shall be thought expedient,\r\nwhich act is to be reported to their several Assemblies, for their\r\nadoption. This was the state of the several propositions relative to the\r\nimpost, and regulation of commerce, at the date of our latest advices\r\nfrom America.\r\n\r\nPage 125. The General Assembly of Virginia, at their session in 1785,\r\npassed an act, declaring that the district, called Kentucky, shall be a\r\nseparate and independent State, on these conditions. 1. That the people\r\nof that district shall consent to it. 2. That Congress shall consent to\r\nit, and shall receive them into the federal Union. 3. That they shall\r\ntake on themselves a proportionable part of the public debt of Virginia.\r\n4. That they shall confirm all titles to lands within their district,\r\nmade by the State of Virginia, before their separation.\r\n\r\nPage 139. It was in 1783, and not in 1781, that Congress quitted\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nPage 140. \"Le Congres qui se trouvoit à la portée des rebelles fut\r\neffrayé.\" I was not present on this occasion, but I have had relations\r\nof the transaction from several who were. The conduct of Congress was\r\nmarked with indignation and firmness. They received no propositions\r\nfrom the mutineers. They came to the resolutions, which may be seen in\r\nthe journals of June the 21st, 1783, then adjourned regularly, and went\r\nthrough the body of the mutineers to their respective lodgings. The\r\nmeasures taken by Dickinson, the President of Pennsylvania, for punishing\r\nthis insult, not being satisfactory to Congress, they assembled, nine\r\ndays after, at Princeton, in Jersey. The people of Pennsylvania sent\r\npetitions declaring their indignation at what had passed, their devotion\r\nto the federal head, and their dispositions to protect it, and praying\r\nthem to return; the legislature, as soon as assembled, did the same\r\nthing; the Executive, whose irresolution had been so exceptionable, made\r\napologies. But Congress were now removed; and, to the opinion that this\r\nexample was proper, other causes were now added, sufficient to _prevent_\r\ntheir return to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPage 155. l. 2. Omit \"La detta actuelle,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAnd also, \"Les details,\" &c., &c., to the end of the paragraph, \"celles\r\ndes Etats Unis;\" page 156. The reason is, that these passages seem to\r\nsuppose, that the several sums emitted by Congress, at different times,\r\namounting nominally to two hundred millions of dollars, had been actually\r\nworth that at the time of emission, and, of course, that the soldiers\r\nand others had received that sum from Congress. But nothing is further\r\nfrom the truth. The soldier, victualler, or other persons who received\r\nforty dollars for a service, at the close of the year 1779, received,\r\nin fact, no more than he who received one dollar for the same service,\r\nin the year 1775, or 1776; because, in those years, the paper money was\r\nat par with silver; whereas, by the close of 1779, forty paper dollars\r\nwere worth but one of silver, and would buy no more of the necessaries\r\nof life. To know what the monies emitted by Congress were worth to the\r\npeople, at the time they received them, we will state the date and amount\r\nof every several emission, the depreciation of paper money at the time,\r\nand the real worth of the emission in silver or gold.\r\n\r\n     +------------------+--------------+-------------+------------------+\r\n     |                  |              |             | Worth of the sum |\r\n     |    Emission.     |  Sum Emitted.|Depreciation.|emitted, in silver|\r\n     |                  |              |             |     dollars.     |\r\n     +------------------+--------------+-------------+------------------+\r\n     |1775.

If we estimate at the same value, the like\r\nsum of two hundred millions, supposed to have been emitted by the States,\r\nand reckon the Federal debt, foreign and domestic, at about forty-three\r\nmillions, and the State debts, at about twenty-five millions, it will\r\nform an amount of one hundred and forty millions of dollars, or seven\r\nhundred and thirty-five millions of livres, Tournois, the total sum which\r\nthe war has cost the inhabitants of the United States. It continued eight\r\nyears, from the battle of Lexington to the cessation of hostilities in\r\nAmerica. The annual expense, then, was about seventeen millions and five\r\nhundred thousand dollars, while that of our enemies was a greater number\r\nof guineas.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, how will the two masses of Continental and of State\r\nmoney have cost the people of the United States seventy-two millions of\r\ndollars, when they are to be redeemed, now, with about six millions? I\r\nanswer, that the difference, being sixty-six millions, has been lost on\r\nthe paper bills, separately, by the successive holders of them. Every\r\none, through whose hands a bill passed, lost on that bill what it lost in\r\nvalue, during the time it was in his hands. This was a real tax on him;\r\nand, in this way, the people of the United States actually contributed\r\nthose sixty-six millions of dollars, during the war, and by a mode of\r\ntaxation the most oppressive of all, because the most unequal of all.\r\n\r\nPage 166; bottom line. Leave out \"Et c'est une autre economie,\" &c. The\r\nreason of this, is, that in 1784, purchases of lands were to be made\r\nof the Indians, which were accordingly made. But in 1785, they did not\r\npropose to make any purchase. The money desired in 1785, five thousand\r\ndollars, was probably to pay agents residing among the Indians, or\r\nbalances of the purchases of 1784. These purchases will not be made every\r\nyear; but only at distant intervals, as our settlements are extended;\r\nand it may be regarded as certain, that not a foot of land will ever\r\nbe taken from the Indians, without their own consent. The sacredness of\r\ntheir rights, is felt by all thinking persons in America, as much as in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nPage 170. Virginia was quotaed the highest of any State in the Union.\r\nBut during the war, several States appear to have paid more, because\r\nthey were free from the enemy, whilst Virginia was cruelly ravaged. The\r\nrequisition of 1784, was so quotaed on the several States, as to bring\r\nup their arrearages; so that when they should have paid the sums then\r\ndemanded, all would be on an equal footing. It is necessary to give a\r\nfurther explanation of this requisition. The requisitions of one million\r\nand two hundred thousand dollars, of eight millions, and two millions,\r\nhad been made during the war, as an experiment, to see whether, in that\r\nsituation, the States could furnish the necessary supplies. It was found\r\nthey could not. The money was thereupon obtained by loans in Europe; and\r\nCongress meant, by their requisition of 1784, to abandon the requisitions\r\nof one million and two hundred thousand dollars, and of two millions,\r\nand also one-half of the eight millions. But as all the States, almost,\r\nhad made some payments in part of that requisition, they were obliged to\r\nretain such a proportion of it, as would enable them to call for equal\r\ncontributions from all the others.\r\n\r\nPage 170. I cannot say how it has happened, that the debt of Connecticut\r\nis greater than that of Virginia. The latter is the richest in\r\nproductions, and, perhaps, made greater exertions to pay for her supplies\r\nin the course of the war.\r\n\r\nPage 172. \"Les Americains sevant aprés une banqueroute,\" &c. The\r\nobjections made to the United States, being here condensed together\r\nin a short compass, perhaps, it would not be improper to condense\r\nthe answers in as small a compass, in some such form as follows. That\r\nis, after the words \"aucun espoir,\" add, \"But to these charges it may\r\nbe justly answered, that those are no bankrupts who acknowledge the\r\nsacredness of their debts, in their just and real amount, who are able,\r\nwithin a reasonable time, to pay them, and who are actually proceeding\r\nin that payment; that they furnish, in fact, the supplies necessary for\r\nthe support of their government; that their officers and soldiers are\r\nsatisfied, as the interest of their debt is paid regularly, and the\r\nprincipal is in a course of payment; that the question, whether they\r\nfought ill, should be asked of those who met them at Bunker's hill,\r\nBennington, Stillwater, King's mountain, the Cowpens, Guilford, and\r\nthe Eutaw. And that the charges of ingratitude, madness, infidelity and\r\ncorruption, are easily made by those to whom falsehoods cost nothing;\r\nbut that no instances, in support of them, have been produced, or can\r\nbe produced.\"\r\n\r\nPage 187. \"Les officiérs et les soldats ont eté payés,\" &c. The balances\r\ndue to the officers and soldiers have been ascertained, and a certificate\r\nof the sum given to each; on these, the interest is regularly paid; and\r\nevery occasion is seized of paying the principal, by receiving these\r\ncertificates as money, whenever public property is sold, till a more\r\nregular and effectual method can be taken, for paying the whole.\r\n\r\nPage 191. \"Quoique la loi dont nous parlons, ne s'observe plus en\r\nAngleterre.\" \"An alien born may purchase lands or other estates, but not\r\nfor his own use; for the King is thereupon entitled to them.\" \"Yet an\r\nalien may acquire a property in goods, money and other personal estate,\r\nor may hire a house for his habitation. For this is necessary for the\r\nadvancement of trade.\" \"Also, an alien may bring an action concerning\r\npersonal property, and may make a will, and dispose of his personal\r\nestate.\" \"When I mention these rights of an alien, I must be understood\r\nof alien _friends_ only, or such whose countries are in peace with ours;\r\nfor alien _enemies_ have no rights, no privileges, unless by the King's\r\nspecial favor, during the time of war.\" Blackstone, B. 1. c. 10, page\r\n372. \"An alien _friend_ may have personal actions, but not real; an\r\nalien _enemy_ shall have neither real, personal, or mixed actions. The\r\nreason why an alien _friend_ is allowed to maintain a personal action,\r\nis, because he would otherwise be incapacitated to merchandise, which\r\nmay be as much to our prejudice as his.\" Cunningham's law dict. title,\r\nAliens. The above is the clear law of England, practiced from the\r\nearliest ages to this day, and never denied. The passage quoted by M.\r\nde Meuisnier from 2 Blackstone, c. 26, is from his chapter, \"Of title\r\nto things _personal by occupancy_.\" The word \"personal,\" shows, that\r\nnothing in this chapter relates to lands, which are _real_ estate; and,\r\ntherefore, this passage does not contract the one before quoted from\r\nthe same author, (1 Bl. c. 10.) which says, that the lands of an alien\r\nbelong to the King. The words, \"of title by _occupancy_,\" show, that it\r\ndoes not relate to _debts_, which, being a moral existence only, cannot\r\nbe the subject of _occupancy_. Blackstone, in this passage, (B. 2. c.\r\n26.) speaks only of personal goods of an alien, which another may find,\r\nand seize as prime occupant.\r\n\r\nPage 193. \"Le remboursement presentera des difficultés des sommes\r\nconsiderables,\" &c. There is no difficulty nor doubt on this subject.\r\nEvery one is sensible how this is to be ultimately settled. Neither the\r\nBritish creditor, nor the State, will be permitted to lose by these\r\npayments. The debtor will be credited for what he paid, according to\r\nwhat it was really worth at the time he paid it, and he must pay the\r\nbalance. Nor does he lose by this; for if a man who owed one thousand\r\ndollars to a British merchant, paid eight hundred paper dollars into\r\nthe treasury, when the depreciation was at eight for one, it is clear\r\nhe paid but one hundred real dollars, and must now pay nine hundred. It\r\nis probable, he received those eight hundred dollars for one hundred\r\nbushels of wheat, which were never worth more than one hundred silver\r\ndollars. He is credited, therefore, the full worth of his wheat. The\r\nequivoque is in the use of the word \"dollar.\"\r\n\r\nPage 226. \"Qu' on abolisse les privileges du clergé.\" This privilege,\r\noriginally allowed to the clergy, is now extended to every man, and\r\neven to women. It is a right of exemption from capital punishment, for\r\nthe first offence, in most cases. It is, then, a pardon by the law. In\r\nother cases, the Executive gives the pardon. But when laws are made as\r\nmild as they should be, both those pardons are absurd. The principle of\r\nBeccaria is sound. Let the legislators be merciful, but the executors of\r\nthe law inexorable. As the term \"privileges du clergé\" may be understood\r\nby foreigners, perhaps, it will be better to strike it out here, and\r\nsubstitute the word \"pardon.\"\r\n\r\nPage 239. \"Les commissaries veulent,\" &c. Manslaughter is the killing a\r\nman with design, but in a sudden gust of passion, and where the killer\r\nhas not had time to cool. The first offence is not punished capitally,\r\nbut the second is. This is the law of England and of all the American\r\nStates; and is not now a new proposition. Those laws have supposed that\r\na man, whose passions have so much dominion over him, as to lead him\r\nto repeated acts of murder, is unsafe to society: that it is better\r\nhe should be put to death by the law, than others, more innocent than\r\nhimself, on the movements of his impetuous passions.\r\n\r\nIbid. \"Mal-aisé d'indiquer la nuance precise,\" &c. In forming a scale\r\nof crimes and punishments, two considerations have principal weight. 1.\r\nThe atrocity of the crime. 2. The peculiar circumstances of a country,\r\nwhich furnish greater temptations to commit it, or greater facilities\r\nfor escaping detection. The punishment must be heavier to counterbalance\r\nthis. Were the first the only consideration, all nations would form\r\nthe same scale. But, as the circumstances of a country have influence\r\non the punishment, and no two countries exist precisely under the same\r\ncircumstances, no two countries will form the same scale of crimes and\r\npunishments. For example; in America, the inhabitants let their horses\r\ngo at large, in the uninclosed lands, which are so extensive, as to\r\nmaintain them altogether. It is easy, therefore, to steal them, and easy\r\nto escape. Therefore, the laws are obliged to oppose these temptations\r\nwith a heavier degree of punishment. For this reason, the stealing of a\r\nhorse in America, is punished more severely, than stealing the same value\r\nin any other form. In Europe, where horses are confined so securely, that\r\nit is impossible to steal them, that species of theft need not be punished\r\nmore severely than any other. In some countries of Europe, stealing\r\nfruit from trees is punished capitally. The reason is, that it being\r\nimpossible to lock fruit trees up in coffers, as we do our money, it is\r\nimpossible to oppose physical bars to this species of theft. Moral ones\r\nare, therefore, opposed by the laws. This, to an unreflecting American,\r\nappears the most enormous of all the abuses of power; because, he has\r\nbeen used to see fruits hanging in such quantities, that, if not taken\r\nby men, they would rot: he has been used to consider them, therefore,\r\nas of no value, and as not furnishing materials for the commission of\r\na crime. This must serve as an apology for the arrangements of crimes\r\nand punishments, in the scale under our consideration. A different one\r\nwould be formed here; and still different ones in Italy, Turkey, China,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nPage 240. \"Les officiers Americains,\" &c., to page 264, \"qui le\r\nmeritoient.\" I would propose to new model this section, in the following\r\nmanner. 1. Give a succinct history of the origin and establishment of\r\nthe Cincinnati. 2. Examine whether, in its present form, it threatens\r\nany dangers to the State. 3. Propose the most practicable method of\r\npreventing them.\r\n\r\nHaving been in America, during the period in which this institution\r\nwas formed, and being then in a situation which gave me opportunities\r\nof seeing it, in all its stages, I may venture to give M. de Meusnier\r\nmaterials for the first branch of the preceding distribution of the\r\nsubject. The second and third, he will best execute himself. I should\r\nwrite its history in the following form:\r\n\r\nWhen, on the close of that war, which established the independence of\r\nAmerica, its army was about to be disbanded, the officers, who, during\r\nthe course of it, had gone through the most trying scenes together, who,\r\nby mutual aids and good offices, had become dear to one another, felt\r\nwith great oppression of mind, the approach of that moment which was to\r\nseparate them, never, perhaps, to meet again. They were from different\r\nStates, and from distant parts of the same State. Hazard alone could,\r\ntherefore, give them but rare and partial occasions of seeing each other.\r\nThey were, of course, to abandon altogether the hope of ever meeting\r\nagain, or to devise some occasion which might bring them together. And\r\nwhy not come together on purpose, at stated times? Would not the trouble\r\nof such a journey be greatly overpaid, by the pleasure of seeing each\r\nother again, by the sweetest of all consolations, the talking over the\r\nscenes of difficulty and of endearment they had gone through? This, too,\r\nwould enable them to know who of them should succeed in the world, who\r\nshould be unsuccessful, and to open the purses of all to every laboring\r\nbrother. This idea was too soothing, not to be cherished in conversation.\r\nIt was improved into that of a regular association, with an organized\r\nadministration, with periodical meetings, general and particular, fixed\r\ncontributions for those who should be in distress, and a badge, by which,\r\nnot only those who had not had occasion to become personally known,\r\nshould be able to recognize one another, but which should be worn by\r\ntheir descendants, to perpetuate among them the friendships which had\r\nbound their ancestors together.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington was, at that moment, oppressed with the operation\r\nof disbanding an army which was not paid, and the difficulty of this\r\noperation was increased, by some two or three States' having expressed\r\nsentiments, which did not indicate a sufficient attention to their\r\npayment. He was sometimes present, when his officers were fashioning in\r\ntheir conversations, their newly proposed society. He saw, the innocence\r\nof its origin, and foresaw no effects less innocent. He was, at that\r\ntime, writing his valedictory letter to the States, which has been so\r\ndeservedly applauded by the world. Far from thinking it a moment to\r\nmultiply the causes of irritation, by thwarting a proposition which\r\nhad absolutely no other basis but that of benevolence and friendship,\r\nhe was rather satisfied to find himself aided in his difficulties by\r\nthis new incident, which occupied, and, at the same time, soothed the\r\nminds of the officers. He thought, too, that this institution would\r\nbe one instrument the more for strengthening the federal bond, and for\r\npromoting federal ideas. The institution was formed. They incorporated\r\ninto it the officers of the French army and navy, by whose sides they\r\nhad fought, and with whose aid they had finally prevailed, extending it\r\nto such grades as they were told might be permitted to enter into it.\r\nThey sent an officer to France, to make the proposition to them, and to\r\nprocure the badges which they had devised for their order. The moment of\r\ndisbanding the army having come, before they could have a full meeting\r\nto appoint their President, the General was prayed to act in that office\r\ntill their first general meeting, which was to be held at Philadelphia,\r\nin the month of May following.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the society were published. Men who read them in their\r\nclosets, unwarmed by those sentiments of friendship which had produced\r\nthem, inattentive to those pains which an approaching separation\r\nhad excited in the minds of the institutors, politicians, who see in\r\neverything only the dangers with which it threatens civil society, in\r\nfine, the laboring people, who, shielded by equal laws, had never seen\r\nany difference between man and man, but had read of terrible oppressions,\r\nwhich people of their description experience in other countries, from\r\nthose who are distinguished by titles and badges, began to be alarmed\r\nat this new institution. A remarkable silence, however, was observed.\r\nTheir solicitudes were long confined within the circles of private\r\nconversation. At length, however, a Mr. Burke, Chief Justice of South\r\nCarolina, broke that silence. He wrote against the new institution,\r\nforeboding its dangers, very imperfectly indeed, because he had nothing\r\nbut his imagination to aid him. An American could do no more; for to\r\ndetail the real evils of aristocracy, they must be seen in Europe. Burke's\r\nfears were thought exaggerations in America; while in Europe, it is known\r\nthat even Mirabeau has but faintly sketched the curses of hereditary\r\naristocracy as they are experienced here, and as they would have followed\r\nin America, had this institution remained. The epigraph of Burke's\r\npamphlet, was, \"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion.\" Its effect corresponded\r\nwith its epigraph. This institution became, first, the subject of\r\ngeneral conversation. Next, it was made the subject of deliberation in\r\nthe legislative Assemblies of some of the States. The Governor of South\r\nCarolina censured it, in an address to the Assembly of that State. The\r\nAssemblies of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania, condemned\r\nits principles. No circumstance, indeed, brought the consideration of\r\nit expressly before Congress; yet it had sunk deep into their minds. An\r\noffer having been made to them, on the part of the Polish order of Divine\r\nProvidence, to receive some of their distinguished citizens into that\r\norder, they made that an occasion to declare, that these distinctions\r\nwere contrary to the principles of their Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness excited by this institution, had very early caught the\r\nnotice of General Washington. Still recollecting all the purity of the\r\nmotives which gave it birth, he became sensible that it might produce\r\npolitical evils, which the warmth of those motives had masked. Add to\r\nthis, that it was disapproved by the mass of citizens of the Union. This,\r\nalone, was reason strong enough, in a country where the will of the\r\nmajority is the law, and ought to be the law. He saw that the objects\r\nof the institution were too light, to be opposed to considerations as\r\nserious as these; and that it was become necessary to annihilate it\r\nabsolutely. On this, therefore, he was decided. The first annual meeting\r\nat Philadelphia was now at hand; he went to that, determined to exert all\r\nhis influence for its suppression. He proposed it to his fellow officers,\r\nand urged it with all his powers. It met an opposition which was observed\r\nto cloud his face with an anxiety, that the most distressful scenes of\r\nthe war had scarcely ever produced. It was canvassed for several days,\r\nand, at length, it was no more a doubt what would be its ultimate fate.\r\nThe order was on the point of receiving its annihilation, by the vote of\r\na great majority of its members. In this moment, their envoy arrived from\r\nFrance, charged with letters from the French officers, accepting with\r\ncordiality the proposed badges of union, with solicitations from others\r\nto be received into the order, and with notice that their respectable\r\nSovereign had been pleased to recognize it, and permit his officers to\r\nwear its badges. The prospect now changed. The question assumed a new\r\nform. After the offer made by them, and accepted by their friends, in\r\nwhat words could they clothe a proposition to retract it, which would\r\nnot cover themselves with the reproaches of levity and ingratitude? which\r\nwould not appear an insult to those whom they loved? Federal principles,\r\npopular discontent, were considerations whose weight was known and felt by\r\nthemselves. But would foreigners know and feel them equally? Would they\r\nso far acknowledge their cogency, as to permit without any indignation,\r\nthe eagle and ribbon to be torn from their breasts, by the very hands\r\nwhich had placed them there? The idea revolted the whole society. They\r\nfound it necessary, then, to preserve so much of their institution as\r\nmight continue to support this foreign branch, while they should prune\r\noff every other, which would give offence to their fellow citizens: thus\r\nsacrificing, on each hand, to their friends and to their country.\r\n\r\nThe society was to retain its existence, its name, its meetings, and\r\nits charitable funds: but these last were to be deposited with their\r\nrespective legislatures. The order was to be no longer hereditary; a\r\nreformation, which had been pressed even from this side the Atlantic; it\r\nwas to be communicated to no new members; the general meetings, instead\r\nof annual, were to be triennial only. The eagle and ribbon, indeed,\r\nwere retained; because they were worn, and they wished them to be worn\r\nby their friends who were in a country where they would not be objects\r\nof offence; but themselves never wore them. They laid them up in their\r\nbureaus with the medals of American Independence, with those of the\r\ntrophies they had taken, and the battles they had won. But through all\r\nthe United States, no officer is seen to offend the public eye, with\r\nthe display of this badge. These changes have tranquillized the American\r\nStates. Their citizens feel too much interest in the reputation of their\r\nofficers, and value too much, whatever may serve to recall to the memory\r\nof their allies, the moments wherein they formed but one people, not\r\nto do justice to the circumstance which prevented a total annihilation\r\nof the order. Though they are obliged by a prudent foresight, to keep\r\nout everything from among themselves, which might pretend to divide\r\nthem into orders, and to degrade one description of men below another,\r\nyet they hear with pleasure, that their allies, whom circumstances have\r\nalready placed under these distinctions, are willing to consider it as\r\none, to have aided them in the establishment of their liberties, and to\r\nwear a badge which may recall them to their remembrance; and it would\r\nbe an extreme affliction to them, if the domestic reformation which has\r\nbeen found necessary, if the censures of individual writers, or if any\r\nother circumstance should discourage the wearing their badge or lessen\r\nits reputation.\r\n\r\nThis short but true history of the order of the Cincinnati, taken from\r\nthe mouths of persons on the spot, who were privy to its origin and\r\nprogress, and who knew its present state, is the best apology which can\r\nbe made for an insinuation, which appeared to be, and was really, so\r\nheterogeneous to the governments in which it was erected.\r\n\r\nIt should be further considered, that in America no other distinction\r\nbetween man and man had ever been known, but that of persons in office,\r\nexercising powers by authority of the laws, and private individuals.\r\nAmong these last, the poorest laborer stood on equal ground with the\r\nwealthiest millionnaire, and generally on a more favored one, whenever\r\ntheir rights seemed to jar. It has been seen that a shoemaker or other\r\nartisan, removed by the voice of his country from his work bench into a\r\nchair of office, has instantly commanded all the respect and obedience\r\nwhich the laws ascribe to his office. But of distinction by birth or\r\nbadge, they had no more idea than they had of the mode of existence in\r\nthe moon or planets. They had heard only that there were such, and knew\r\nthat they must be wrong. A due horror of the evils which flow from these\r\ndistinctions, could be excited in Europe only, where the dignity of man\r\nis lost in arbitrary distinctions, where the human species is classed\r\ninto several stages of degradation, where the many are crushed under\r\nthe weight of the few, and where the order established, can present to\r\nthe contemplation of a thinking being, no other picture than that of God\r\nAlmighty and his angels, trampling under foot the host of the damned. No\r\nwonder, then, that the institution of the Cincinnati should be innocently\r\nconceived by one order of American citizens, should raise in the other\r\norders, only a slow, temperate, and rational opposition, and should be\r\nviewed in Europe as a detestable parricide.\r\n\r\nThe second and third branches of this subject, no body can better execute\r\nthan M. de Meusnier. Perhaps it may be curious to him to see how they\r\nstrike an American mind at present. He shall, therefore, have the ideas\r\nof one who was an enemy to the institution from the first moment of\r\nits conception, but who was always sensible that the officers neither\r\nforesaw nor intended the injury they were doing to their country.\r\n\r\nAs to the question, then, whether any evil can proceed from the\r\ninstitution as it stands at present, I am of opinion their may. 1. From\r\nthe meetings. These will keep the officers formed into a body; will\r\ncontinue a distinction between the civil and military, which it would\r\nbe for the good of the whole to obliterate, as soon as possible; and the\r\nmilitary assemblies will not only keep alive the jealousies and fears of\r\nthe civil government, but give ground for these fears and jealousies.\r\nFor when men meet together, they will make business if they have none;\r\nthey will collate their grievances, some real, some imaginary, all highly\r\npainted; they will communicate to each other the sparks of discontent;\r\nand these may engender a flame which will consume their particular, as\r\nwell as the general happiness. 2. The charitable part of the institution\r\nis still more likely to do mischief, as it perpetuates the dangers\r\napprehended in the preceding clause. For here is a fund provided of\r\npermanent existence. To whom will it belong? To the descendants of\r\nAmerican officers of a certain description. These descendants, then,\r\nwill form a body, having sufficient interest to keep up an attention to\r\ntheir description, to continue meetings, and perhaps, in some moment,\r\nwhen the political eye shall be slumbering, or the firmness of their\r\nfellow citizens relaxed, to replace the insignia of the order and revive\r\nall its pretensions. What good can the officers propose which may weigh\r\nagainst these possible evils? The securing their descendants against\r\nwant? Why afraid to trust them to the same fertile soil, and the same\r\ngenial climate, which will secure from want the descendants of their\r\nother fellow citizens? Are they afraid they will be reduced to labor\r\nthe earth for their sustenance? They will be rendered thereby both more\r\nhonest and happy. An industrious farmer occupies a more dignified place\r\nin the scale of beings, whether moral or political, than a lazy lounger,\r\nvaluing himself on his family, too proud to work, and drawing out a\r\nmiserable existence, by eating on that surplus of other men's labor,\r\nwhich is the sacred fund of the helpless poor. A pitiful annuity will\r\nonly prevent them from exerting that industry and those talents which\r\nwould soon lead them to better fortune.\r\n\r\nHow are these evils to be prevented? 1. At their first general meeting,\r\nlet them distribute the funds on hand to the existing objects of their\r\ndestination, and discontinue all further contributions. 2. Let them\r\ndeclare, at the same time, that their meetings, general and particular,\r\nshall thenceforth cease. 3. Let them melt up their eagles and add the\r\nmass to the distributable fund, that their descendants may have no\r\ntemptation to hang them in their button holes.\r\n\r\nThese reflections are not proposed as worthy the notice of M. de Meusnier.\r\nHe will be so good as to treat the subject in his own way, and no body\r\nhas a better. I will only pray him to avail us of his forcible manner,\r\nto evince that there is evil to be apprehended, even from the ashes of\r\nthis institution, and to exhort the society in America to make their\r\nreformation complete; bearing in mind, that we must keep the passions\r\nof men on our side, even when we are persuading them to do what they\r\nought to do.\r\n\r\nPage 268. \"Et en effet la population,\" &c. Page 270. \"Plus de confiance.\"\r\n\r\nTo this we answer that no such census of the numbers was ever given out\r\nby Congress, nor ever presented to them: and further, that Congress never\r\nhave, at any time, declared by their vote, the number of inhabitants in\r\ntheir respective States. On the 22d of June, 1775, they first resolved\r\nto emit paper money. The sum resolved on was two millions of dollars.\r\nThey declared, then, that the twelve confederate colonies (for Georgia\r\nhad not yet joined them) should be pledged for the redemption of these\r\nbills. To ascertain in what proportion each State should be bound, the\r\nmembers from each were desired to say, as nearly as they could, what\r\nwas the number of the inhabitants of their respective States. They were\r\nvery much unprepared for such a declaration. They guessed, however, as\r\nwell as they could. The following are the numbers, as they conjectured\r\nthem, and the consequent apportionment of the two millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n                        Inhabitants.    Dollars.\r\n     New Hampshire,       100,000         82,713\r\n     Massachusetts,       350,000        289,496\r\n     Rhode Island,         58,000         47,973\r\n     Connecticut,         200,000        165,426\r\n     New York,            200,000        165,426\r\n     New Jersey,          180,000        107,527\r\n     Pennsylvania,        300,000        248,139\r\n     Delaware,             30,000         24,813\r\n     Maryland,            250,000        206,783\r\n     Virginia,            400,000        330,852\r\n     North Carolina,      200,000        165,426\r\n     South Carolina,      200,000        165,426\r\n                        ---------      ---------\r\n                        2,418,000      2,000,000\r\n\r\nGeorgia having not yet acceded to the measures of the other States, was\r\nnot quotaed; but her numbers were generally estimated at about thirty\r\nthousand, and so would have made the whole two million four hundred\r\nand forty-eight thousand persons, of every condition. But it is to\r\nbe observed, that though Congress made this census the basis of their\r\napportionment, yet they did not even give it a place on their journals;\r\nmuch less publish it to the world with their sanction. The way it got\r\nabroad was this: As the members declared from their seats the number of\r\ninhabitants which they conjectured to be in their State, the secretary\r\nof Congress wrote them on a piece of paper, calculated the portion of\r\ntwo millions of dollars to be paid by each, and entered the sum only in\r\nthe journals. The members, however, for their own satisfaction, and the\r\ninformation of their States, took copies of this enumeration and sent\r\nthem to their States. From thence they got into the public papers: and\r\nwhen the English news writers found it answer their purpose to compare\r\nthis with the enumeration of 1783, as their principle is \"to lie boldly\r\nthat they may not be suspected of lying,\" they made it amount to three\r\nmillions one hundred and thirty-seven thousand eight hundred and nine,\r\nand ascribed its publication to Congress itself.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1785, Congress being to call on the States to raise a million\r\nand a half of dollars annually for twenty-five years, it was necessary\r\nto apportion this among them. The States had never furnished them with\r\ntheir exact numbers. It was agreed, too, that in this apportionment five\r\nslaves should be counted as three freemen only. The preparation of this\r\nbusiness was in the hands of a committee; they applied to the members\r\nfor the best information they could give them of the number of their\r\nStates. Some of the States had taken pains to discover their numbers.\r\nOthers had done nothing in that way, and, of course, were now where they\r\nwere in 1775, when their numbers were first called on to declare their\r\nnumbers. Under these circumstances, and on the principle of counting\r\nthree-fifths only of the slaves, the committee apportioned the money\r\namong the States, and reported their work to Congress. In this they\r\nhad assessed South Carolina as having one hundred and seventy thousand\r\ninhabitants The delegate for that State, however, prevailed on Congress\r\nto assess them on the footing of one hundred and fifty thousand only, in\r\nconsideration of the state of total devastation in which the enemy had\r\nleft their country. The difference was then laid on the other States,\r\nand the following was the result:--\r\n\r\n                        Inhabitants.    Dollars.\r\n     New Hampshire,        82,200         52,708\r\n     Massachusetts,       350,000        224,427\r\n     Rhode Island,         50,400         32,318\r\n     Connecticut,         206,000        132,091\r\n     New York,            200,000        128,243\r\n     New Jersey,          130,000         83,358\r\n     Pennsylvania,        320,000        205,189\r\n     Delaware,             35,000         22,443\r\n     Maryland,            220,700        141,517\r\n     Virginia,            400,000        256,487\r\n     North Carolina,      170,000        109,006\r\n     South Carolina,      150,000         96,183\r\n     Georgia,              25,000         16,030\r\n                        ---------      ---------\r\n                        2,339,300      1,500,000\r\n\r\nStill, however, Congress refused to give the enumeration the sanction\r\nof a place on their journals, because it was not formed on such evidence\r\nas a strict attention to accuracy and truth required. They used it from\r\nnecessity, because they could get no better rule, and they entered on\r\ntheir journals only the apportionment of money. The members, however,\r\nas before, took copies of the enumeration, which was the groundwork\r\nof the apportionment, sent them to their States, and thus this second\r\nenumeration got into the public papers, and was by the English ascribed\r\nto Congress as their declaration of their present numbers. To get at the\r\nreal numbers which this enumeration supposes, we must add twenty thousand\r\nto the number on which South Carolina was quoted; we must consider\r\nthat seven hundred thousand slaves are counted but as four hundred\r\nand twenty thousand persons, and add, on that account, two hundred and\r\neighty thousand. This will give us a total of two millions six hundred\r\nand thirty-nine thousand three hundred inhabitants of every condition\r\nin the thirteen States, being two hundred and twenty-one thousand three\r\nhundred more than the enumeration of 1775, instead of seven hundred\r\nand ninety-eight thousand five hundred and nine less, which the English\r\npapers asserted to be the diminution of numbers in the United States,\r\naccording to the confession of Congress themselves.\r\n\r\nPage 272. \"Comportera peut etre une population de thirty millions.\"\r\n\r\nThe territory of the United States contains about a million of square\r\nmiles, English. There is, in them, a greater proportion of fertile\r\nlands than in the British dominions in Europe. Suppose the territory of\r\nthe United States, then, to attain an equal degree of population with\r\nthe British European dominions, they will have an hundred millions of\r\ninhabitants. Let us extend our views to what may be the population of\r\nthe two continents of North and South America, supposing them divided at\r\nthe narrowest part of the isthmus of Panama. Between this line and that\r\nof 50' of north latitude, the northern continent contains about five\r\nmillions of square miles, and south of this line of division the southern\r\ncontinent contains about seven millions of square miles. I do not pass the\r\n50th degree of northern latitude in my reckoning, because we must draw a\r\nline somewhere, and considering the soil and climate beyond that, I would\r\nonly avail my calculation of it, as a make weight, to make good what the\r\ncolder regions within that line may be supposed to fall short in their\r\nfuture population. Here are twelve millions of square miles, then, which,\r\nat the rate of population before assumed, will nourish twelve hundred\r\nmillions of inhabitants, a number greater than the present population\r\nof the whole globe is supposed to amount to. If those who propose medals\r\nfor the resolution of questions, about which nobody makes any question,\r\nthose who have invited discussion on the pretended problem, Whether the\r\ndiscovery of America was for the good of mankind? if they, I say, would\r\nhave viewed it only as doubling the numbers of mankind, and, of course,\r\nthe quantum of existence and happiness, they might have saved the money\r\nand the reputation which their proposition has cost them. The present\r\npopulation of the inhabited parts of the United Stated is of about ten\r\nto the square mile; and experience has shown us, that wherever we reach\r\nthat, the inhabitants become uneasy, as too much compressed, and go off\r\nin great numbers to search for vacant country. Within forty years their\r\nwhole territory will be peopled at that rate. We may fix that, then, as\r\nthe term beyond which the people of those States will not be restrained\r\nwithin their present limits; we may fix that population, too, as the\r\nlimit which they will not exceed till the whole of those two continents\r\nare filled up to that mark, that is to say, till they shall contain one\r\nhundred and twenty millions of inhabitants. The soil of the country on\r\nthe western side of the Mississippi, its climate, and its vicinity to the\r\nUnited States, point it out as the first which will receive population\r\nfrom that nest. The present occupiers will just have force enough to\r\nrepress and restrain the emigrations to a certain degree of consistence.\r\nWe have seen lately a single person go and decide on a settlement in\r\nKentucky, many hundred miles from any white inhabitant, remove thither\r\nwith his family and a few neighbors; and though perpetually harassed by\r\nthe Indians, that settlement in the course of ten years has acquired\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants. Its numbers are increasing while we are\r\nwriting, and the State, of which it formerly made a part, has offered\r\nit independence.\r\n\r\nPage 280, line five. \"Huit des onze Etats,\" &c. Say, \"There were ten\r\nStates present; six voted unanimously for it, three against it, and one\r\nwas divided; and seven votes being requisite to decide the proposition\r\naffirmatively, it was lost. The voice of a single individual of the State\r\nwhich was divided, or of one of those which were of the negative, would\r\nhave prevented this abominable crime from spreading itself over the new\r\ncountry. Thus we see the fate of millions unborn hanging on the tongue\r\nof one man, and heaven was silent in that awful moment! But it is to be\r\nhoped it will not always be silent, and that the friends to the rights\r\nof human nature will in the end prevail.\r\n\r\n\"On the 16th of March, 1785, it was moved in Congress that the same\r\nproposition should be referred to a committee, and it was referred by\r\nthe votes of eight States against three. We do not hear that anything\r\nfurther is yet done on it.\"\r\n\r\nPage 286. \"L'autorité du Congrés etoit necessaire.\" The substance of\r\nthe passage alluded to in the journal of Congress, May the 26th, 1784,\r\nis, \"That the authority of Congress to make _requisitions_ of troops\r\nduring peace is questioned; that such an authority would be dangerous,\r\ncombined with the acknowledged one of emitting or borrowing money; and\r\nthat a few troops only being wanted to guard magazines and garrison the\r\nfrontier posts, it would be more proper at present to _recommend_ than\r\nto require.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson presents his compliments to M. de Meusnier, and sends him\r\ncopies of the thirteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth articles of\r\ntreaty between the King of Prussia and the United States.\r\n\r\nIf M. de Meusnier proposes to mention the facts of cruelty of which\r\nhe and Mr. Jefferson spoke yesterday, the twenty-fourth article will\r\nintroduce them properly, because they produced a sense of the necessity\r\nof that article. These facts are, 1. The death of upwards of eleven\r\nthousand American prisoners in one prison ship (the Jersey), and in the\r\nspace of three years. 2. General Howe's permitting our prisoners, taken\r\nat the battle of Germantown, and placed under a guard in the yard of the\r\nStatehouse of Philadelphia, to be so long without any food furnished them\r\nthat many perished with hunger. Where the bodies laid, it was seen that\r\nthey had eaten all the grass around them within their reach, after they\r\nhad lost the power of rising, or moving from their place. 3. The second\r\nfact was the act of a commanding officer; the first, of several commanding\r\nofficers, and for so long a time as must suppose the approbation of\r\ngovernment. But the following was the act of government itself. During the\r\nperiods that our affairs seemed unfavorable, and theirs successful, that\r\nis to say, after the evacuation of New York, and again, after the taking\r\nof Charleston, in South Carolina, they regularly sent our prisoners,\r\ntaken on the seas and carried to England, to the East Indies. This is\r\nso certain, that in the month of November or December, 1785, Mr. Adams\r\nhaving officially demanded a delivery of the American prisoners sent to\r\nthe East Indies, Lord Cærmarthen answered, officially, \"That orders were\r\nimmediately issued for their discharge.\" M. de Meusnier is at liberty to\r\nquote this fact. 4. A fact to be ascribed not only to the government, but\r\nto the parliament, who passed an act for that purpose in the beginning\r\nof the war, was the obliging our prisoners taken at sea, to join them,\r\nand fight against their countrymen. This they effected by starving and\r\nwhipping them. The insult on Captain Stanhope, which happened at Boston\r\nlast year, was a consequence of this. Two persons, Dunbar and Lowthorp,\r\nwhom Stanhope had treated in this manner (having particularly inflicted\r\ntwenty-four lashes on Dunbar), meeting him at Boston, attempted to beat\r\nhim. But the people interposed and saved him. The fact is referred to\r\nin that paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, which says, \"He\r\nhas constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to\r\nbear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their\r\nfriends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\" This was\r\nthe most afflicting to our prisoners of all the cruelties exercised on\r\nthem. The others affected the body only, but this the mind; they were\r\nhaunted by the horror of having, perhaps, themselves shot the ball by\r\nwhich a father or a brother fell. Some of them had constancy enough to\r\nhold out against half allowance of food and repeated whippings. These\r\nwere generally sent to England, and from thence to the East Indies. One\r\nof them escaped from the East Indies, and got back to Paris, where he\r\ngave an account of his sufferings to Mr. Adams, who happened to be then\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nM. de Meusnier, where he mentions that the slave law has been passed in\r\nVirginia, without the clause of emancipation, is pleased to mention, that\r\nneither Mr. Wythe, nor Mr. Jefferson was present, to make the proposition\r\nthey had meditated; from which, people, who do not give themselves\r\nthe trouble to reflect or inquire, might conclude hastily, that their\r\nabsence was the cause why the proposition was not made; and, of course,\r\nthat there were not in the Assembly, persons of virtue and firmness\r\nenough to propose the clause for emancipation. This supposition would\r\nnot be true. There were persons there, who wanted neither the virtue to\r\npropose, nor talents to enforce the proposition, had they seen that the\r\ndisposition of the legislature was ripe for it. These worthy characters\r\nwould feel themselves wounded, degraded, and discouraged by this idea.\r\nMr. Jefferson would therefore be obliged to M. de Meusnier, to mention it\r\nin some such manner as this. \"Of the two commissioners, who had concerted\r\nthe amendatory clause for the gradual emancipation of slaves, Mr. Wythe\r\ncould not be present, he being a member of the judiciary department, and\r\nMr. Jefferson was absent on the legation to France. But there were not\r\nwanting in that Assembly, men of virtue enough to propose, and talents\r\nto vindicate this clause. But they saw, that the moment of doing it with\r\nsuccess was not yet arrived, and that an unsuccessful effort, as too\r\noften happens, would only rivet still closer the chains of bondage, and\r\nretard the moment of delivery to this oppressed description of men. What\r\na stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! who can endure\r\ntoil, famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself, in vindication\r\nof his own liberty, and, the next moment be deaf to all those motives\r\nwhose power supported him through his trial, and inflict on his fellow\r\nmen a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery, than ages\r\nof that which he rose in rebellion to oppose. But we must await, with\r\npatience, the workings of an overruling Providence, and hope that that\r\nis preparing the deliverance of these, our suffering brethren. When\r\nthe measure of their tears shall be full, when their groans shall have\r\ninvolved heaven itself in darkness, doubtless, a God of justice will\r\nawaken to their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality among\r\ntheir oppressors, or, at length, by his exterminating thunder, manifest\r\nhis attention to the things of this world, and that they are not left\r\nto the guidance of a blind fatality.\"\r\n\r\n     [The following are the articles of the treaty with Prussia,\r\n     referred to in the preceding observations.]\r\n\r\nArticle 13. And in the same case, of one of the contracting parties being\r\nengaged in war with any other power, to prevent all the difficulties\r\nand misunderstandings, that usually arise respecting the merchandise\r\nheretofore called contraband, such as arms, ammunition, and military\r\nstores of every kind, no such articles, carried in the vessels, or by the\r\nsubjects or citizens of one of the parties, to the enemies of the other,\r\nshall be deemed contraband, so as to induce confiscation or condemnation,\r\nand a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless, it shall be lawful\r\nto stop such vessels and articles, and to detain them for such length of\r\ntime, as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience\r\nor damage that might ensue from their proceeding, paying, however, a\r\nreasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the\r\nproprietors; and it shall further be allowed to use, in the service of\r\nthe captors, the whole or any part of the military stores so detained,\r\npaying the owners the full value of the same, to be ascertained by the\r\ncurrent price at the place of its destination. But in the case supposed,\r\nof a vessel stopped for articles heretofore deemed contraband, if the\r\nmaster of the vessel stopped, will deliver out the goods supposed to\r\nbe of contraband nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the vessel\r\nshall not, in that case, be carried into any port, nor further detained,\r\nbut shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.\r\n\r\nArticle 23. If war should arise between the two contracting parties,\r\nthe merchants of either country, then residing in the other, shall be\r\nallowed to remain nine months to collect their debts, and settle their\r\naffairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects, without\r\nmolestation or hindrance; and all women and children, scholars of every\r\nfaculty, cultivators of the earth, artizans, manufacturers, and fishermen,\r\nunarmed, and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, or places, and in\r\ngeneral, all others whose occupations are for the common subsistence\r\nand benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to continue their respective\r\nemployments, and shall not be molested in their persons, nor shall their\r\nhouses be burned or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the\r\narmed force of the enemy, into whose power, by the events of war, they may\r\nhappen to fall; but if anything is necessary to be taken from them, for\r\nthe use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable\r\nprice And all merchant and trading vessels, employed in exchanging the\r\nproducts of different places, and thereby rendering the necessaries,\r\nconveniences, and comforts of human life more easy to be obtained, and\r\nmore general, shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested. And neither\r\nof the contracting parties shall grant, or issue any commission to any\r\nprivate armed vessels, empowering them to take or destroy such trading\r\nvessels, or interrupt such commerce.\r\n\r\nArticle 24. And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of war, by\r\nsending them into distant and inclement countries, or by crowding them\r\ninto close and noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly\r\npledge themselves to each other and the world, that they will not adopt\r\nany such practice; that neither will send the prisoners whom they may\r\ntake from the other, into the East Indies or any other parts of Asia or\r\nAfrica; but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions\r\nin Europe or America, in wholesome situations, that they shall not be\r\nconfined in dungeons, prison ships, nor prisons, nor be put into irons,\r\nnor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs. That\r\nthe officers shall be enlarged, on their paroles, within convenient\r\ndistricts, and have comfortable quarters, and the common men be disposed\r\nin cantonments, open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and lodged\r\nin barracks as roomy and good, as are provided by the party in whose\r\npower they are, for their own troops; that the officers shall be daily\r\nfurnished by the party, in whose power they are, with as many rations,\r\nand of the same articles and quality, as are allowed by them, either in\r\nkind or by commutation, to officers of equal rank in their own army;\r\nand all others shall be daily furnished by them, with such rations as\r\nthey allow to a common soldier in their own service; the value whereof\r\nshall be paid by the other party, on a mutual adjustment of accounts\r\nfor the subsistence of prisoners, at the close of the war; and the said\r\naccounts shall not be mingled with, or set off against any others, nor\r\nthe balances due on them, be withheld as a satisfaction or reprisal for\r\nany other article, or for any other cause, real or pretended, whatever.\r\nThat each party shall be allowed to keep a commissary of prisoners, of\r\ntheir own appointment, with every separate cantonment of prisoners in\r\npossession of the other, which commissary shall see the prisoners as\r\noften as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive and distribute whatever\r\ncomforts may be sent to them by their friends, and shall be free to make\r\nhis reports in open letters, to those who employ him. But if any officer\r\nshall break his parole, or any other prisoners shall escape from the\r\nlimits of his cantonment, after they shall have been designated to him,\r\nsuch individual officer, or other prisoner, shall forfeit so much of\r\nthe benefit of this article, as provides for his enlargement on parole\r\nor cantonment. And it is declared, that either the pretence that war\r\ndissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever, shall be considered as\r\nannulling or suspending this, or the next preceding article, but, on\r\nthe contrary, that the state of war is precisely that for which they\r\nare provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed, as\r\nthe most acknowledged articles in the law of nature and nations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [15] The sum actually voted was 50,000,400, but part of it\r\n     was for exchange of old bills, without saying how much. It is\r\n     presumed that these exchanges absorbed $25,552,783, because\r\n     the remainder, 24,447,620, with all the other emissions\r\n     preceding Sept. 2, 1779, will amount to 159,918,800, the\r\n     sum which Congress declared to be then in circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_Answers to questions propounded by M. de Meusnier, Jan. 24th, 1786._\r\n\r\n1. On the original establishment of the several States, the civil code\r\nof England, from whence they had emigrated, was adopted. This of course\r\ncould extend only to general laws, and not to those which were particular\r\nto certain places in England only. The circumstances of the new States\r\nobliged them to add some new laws, which their special situation required,\r\nand even to change some of the general laws of England in cases which did\r\nnot suit their circumstances or ways of thinking. The law of descents,\r\nfor instance, was changed in several States. On the late revolution, the\r\nchanges which their new form of government rendered necessary were easily\r\nmade. It was only necessary to say that the powers of legislation, the\r\njudiciary, and the executive powers, heretofore exercised by persons of\r\nsuch and such description, shall henceforth be exercised by persons to\r\nbe appointed in such and such manners. This was what their constitution\r\ndid. Virginia thought it might be necessary to examine the whole code\r\nof law, to reform such parts of it as had been calculated to produce\r\na devotion to monarchy, and to reduce into smaller volume such useful\r\nparts as had become too diffuse. A committee was appointed to execute\r\nthis work; they did it; and the Assembly began in October, 1785, the\r\nexamination of it, in order to change such parts of the report as might\r\nnot meet their approbation, and to establish what they should approve.\r\nWe may expect to hear the result of their deliberations about the last\r\nof February next.\r\n\r\nI have heard that Connecticut undertook a like work; but I am not sure\r\nof this, nor do I know whether any other of the States have or have not\r\ndone the same.\r\n\r\n2. The constitution of New Hampshire, established in 1776, having been\r\nexpressly made to continue only during the contest with Great Britain,\r\nthey proceeded, after the close of that, to form and establish a permanent\r\none, which they did. The Convention of Virginia which organized their\r\nnew government, had been chosen before a separation from Great Britain\r\nhad been thought of in their State. They had, therefore, none but the\r\nordinary powers of legislation. This leaves their act for organizing\r\nthe government subject to be altered by every legislative assembly; and\r\nthough no general change in it has been made, yet its effect has been\r\ncontrolled in several special cases. It is therefore thought that that\r\nState will appoint a convention for the special purpose of forming a\r\nstable constitution. I think no change has been made in any other of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\n3. The following is a rough estimate of the particular debts of some of\r\nthe States as they existed in the year 1784:\r\n\r\n     New Hampshire     $500,000\r\n     Rhode Island     5,000,000\r\n     Massachusetts      430,000\r\n     Connecticut      3,439,086⅔\r\n     Virginia         2,300,000.\r\n\r\n     United States' principal of Foreign\r\n     debt nearly                           $7,000,000.\r\n\r\n     The principal of the Domestic\r\n     debt is somewhere between 27½\r\n     millions and 35¼ millions, call\r\n     it therefore                          31,300,000.\r\n                                          ------------\r\n                                          $38,300,000.\r\n\r\nThe other States not named here, are probably indebted in the same\r\nproportion to their abilities. If so, and we estimate their abilities\r\nby the rule of quotaing them those eight States will owe about fourteen\r\nmillions, and consequently the particular debts of all the States will\r\namount to twenty-five or twenty-six millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n5. A particular answer to this question would lead to very minute\r\ndetails: one general idea, however, may be applied to all the States.\r\nEach having their separate debt, and a determinate proportion of the\r\nFederal debt, they endeavor to lay taxes sufficient to pay the interest\r\nof both of these, and to support their own and the Federal Government.\r\nThese taxes are generally about one or one and a-half per cent. on the\r\nvalue of property; and from two and a-half to five per cent. on foreign\r\nmerchandise imported. But the payment of this interest regularly, is not\r\naccomplished in many of the States. The people are as yet not recovered\r\nfrom the depredations of the war. When that ended their houses were\r\nin ruin, their farms waste, themselves distressed for clothing and\r\nnecessaries for their households. They cannot as yet, therefore, bear\r\nheavy taxes. For the payment of the principal no final measures are yet\r\ntaken. Some States will have land for sale, the produce of which may\r\npay the principal debt. Some will endeavor to have an exceeding of their\r\ntaxes to be applied as a sinking fund; and all of them look forward to\r\nthe increase of population, and of course an increase of productions in\r\ntheir present taxes, to enable them to be sinking their debt. This is\r\na general view. Some of the States have not yet made even just efforts\r\nfor satisfying either the principal or interest of their public debt.\r\n\r\n6. By the close of the year 1785 there had probably passed over about\r\n50,000 emigrants. Most of these were Irish. The greatest number of the\r\nresidue were Germans. Philadelphia receives most of them, and next to\r\nthat, Baltimore and New York.\r\n\r\n7. Nothing is decided as to Vermont. The four northernmost States wish\r\nit to be received into the Union. The Middle and Southern States are\r\nrather opposed to it. But the great difficulty arises with New York,\r\nwhich claims that territory. In the beginning every individual revolted\r\nat the idea of giving them up. Congress therefore only interfered from\r\ntime to time, to prevent the two parties from coming to an open rupture.\r\nIn the meanwhile the minds of the New Yorkers have been familiarizing to\r\nthe idea of a separation, and I think it will not be long before they\r\nwill consent to it. In that case, the Southern and Middle States will\r\ndoubtless acquiesce, and Vermont will be received into the Union.\r\n\r\n8. LeMaine, a part of the government of Massachusetts, but detached from\r\nit, (the State of New Hampshire lying between,) begins to desire to be\r\nseparated. They are very weak in numbers as yet: but whenever they shall\r\nattain a certain degree of population, there are circumstances which\r\nrender it highly probable they will be allowed to become a separate\r\nmember of the Union.\r\n\r\n9. It is believed that the State of Virginia has by this time made a\r\nsecond cession of lands to Congress, comprehending all those between\r\nthe meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, the Ohio, Mississippi,\r\nand Carolina boundary. Within this lies Kentucky. I believe that their\r\nnumbers are sufficient already to entitle them to come into Congress. And\r\ntheir reception there will only increase the delay necessary for taking\r\nthe consent of the several Assemblies. There is no other new State as\r\nyet approaching the time of its reception.\r\n\r\n10. The number of Royalists which left New York, South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, when they were evacuated by the British army was considerable,\r\nbut I am absolutely unable to conjecture their numbers. From all the\r\nother States, I suppose perhaps two thousand may have gone.\r\n\r\n11. The Confederation is a wonderfully perfect instrument, considering\r\nthe circumstances under which it was formed. There are, however, some\r\nalterations which experience proves to be wanting. These are principally\r\nthree. 1. To establish a general rule for the admission of new States\r\ninto the Union. By the confederation no new States, except Canada,\r\ncan be permitted to have a vote in Congress without first obtaining\r\nthe consent of all the thirteen legislatures. It becomes necessary to\r\nagree what districts may be established into separate States, and at\r\nwhat period of their population they may come into Congress. The act of\r\nCongress of April 23, 1784, has pointed out what ought to be agreed on,\r\nto say also what number of votes must concur when the number of voters\r\nshall be thus enlarged. 2. The Confederation, in its eighth article,\r\ndecides that the quota of money to be contributed by the several States\r\nshall be proportioned to the value of the landed property in the State.\r\nExperience has shown it impracticable to come at this value. Congress\r\nhave therefore recommended to the States to agree that their quotas\r\nshall be in proportion to the number of their inhabitants, counting five\r\nslaves, however, but as equal to three free inhabitants. I believe all\r\nthe States have agreed to this alteration except Rhode Island. 3. The\r\nConfederation forbids the States individually to enter into treaties of\r\ncommerce, or of any other nature, with foreign nations: and it authorizes\r\nCongress to establish such treaties, with two reservations however,\r\nviz., that they shall agree to no treaty which would, 1. restrain the\r\nlegislatures from imposing such duties on foreigners as natives are\r\nsubject to; or 2., from prohibiting the exportation or importation of\r\nany species of commodities. Congress may therefore be said to have a\r\npower to regulate commerce so far as it can be effected by conventions\r\nwith other nations, and by conventions which do not infringe the two\r\nfundamental reservations before mentioned. But this is too imperfect.\r\nBecause, till a convention be made with any particular nation, the\r\ncommerce of any one of our States with that nation may be regulated by\r\nthe State itself, and even when a convention is made, the regulation\r\nof the commerce is taken out of the hands of the several States only so\r\nfar as it is covered or provided for by that convention or treaty. But\r\ntreaties are made in such general terms, that the greater part of the\r\nregulations would still result to the legislatures. Let us illustrate\r\nthese observations by observing how far the commerce of France and\r\nEngland can be affected by the State Legislatures. As to England, any\r\none of the legislatures may impose on her goods double the duties which\r\nare paid other nations; may prohibit their goods altogether; may refuse\r\nthem the usual facilities for recovering their debts or withdrawing\r\ntheir property; may refuse to receive their Consuls or to give those\r\nConsuls any jurisdiction. But with France, whose commerce is protected\r\nby a treaty, no State can give any molestation to that commerce which is\r\ndefended by the treaty. Thus, though a State may exclude the importation\r\nof all wines (because one of the reservations aforesaid is that they\r\nmay prohibit the importation of any species of commodities), yet they\r\ncannot prohibit the importation of French wines, particularly while they\r\nallow wines to be brought in from other countries. They cannot impose\r\nheavier duties on French commodities than on those of other nations. They\r\ncannot throw peculiar obstacles in the way of their recovery of debts\r\ndue to them, &c., &c., because those things are provided for by treaty.\r\nTreaties, however, are very imperfect machines for regulating commerce\r\nin the detail. The principal objects in the regulation of our commerce\r\nwould be: 1. to lay such duties, restrictions, or prohibitions on the\r\ngoods of any particular nation, as might oblige that nation to concur in\r\njust and equal arrangements of commerce. 2. To lay such uniform duties\r\non the articles of commerce throughout all the States, as may avail\r\nthem of that fund for assisting to bear the burthen of public expenses.\r\nNow, this cannot be done by the States separately, because they will not\r\nseparately pursue the same plan. New Hampshire cannot lay a given duty\r\non a particular article unless Massachusetts will do the same, because\r\nit will turn the importation of that article from her ports into those\r\nof Massachusetts, from whence they will be smuggled into New Hampshire by\r\nland. But though Massachusetts were willing to concur with New Hampshire\r\nin laying the same duty, yet she cannot do it for the same reason, unless\r\nRhode Island will also, nor can Rhode Island without Connecticut, nor\r\nConnecticut without New York, nor New York without New Jersey, and so\r\non quite to Georgia. It is visible, therefore, that the commerce of the\r\nStates cannot be regulated to the best advantage but by a single body,\r\nand no body so proper as Congress. Many of the States have agreed to add\r\nan article to the Confederation for allowing to Congress the regulation\r\nof their commerce, only providing that the revenues to be raised on it\r\nshall belong to the States in which they are levied. Yet it is believed\r\nthat Rhode Island will prevent this also. An everlasting recurrence to\r\nthis same obstacle will occasion a question to be asked. How happens it\r\nthat Rhode Island is opposed to every useful proposition? Her geography\r\naccounts for it, with the aid of one or two observations. The cultivators\r\nof the earth are the most virtuous citizens, and possess most of the\r\namor patriæ. Merchants are the least virtuous, and possess the least of\r\nthe amor patriæ. The latter reside principally in the seaport towns, the\r\nformer in the interior country. Now, it happened that of the territory\r\nconstituting Rhode Island and Connecticut, the part containing the\r\nseaports was erected into a State by itself, called Rhode Island, and\r\nthat containing the interior country was erected into another State\r\ncalled Connecticut. For though it has a little sea-coast, there are no\r\ngood ports in it. Hence it happens that there is scarcely one merchant\r\nin the whole State of Connecticut, while there is not a single man in\r\nRhode Island who is not a merchant of some sort. Their whole territory is\r\nbut a thousand square miles, and what of that is in use is laid out in\r\ngrass farms almost entirely. Hence they have scarcely any body employed\r\nin agriculture. All exercise some species of commerce. This circumstance\r\nhas decided the characters of these two States. The remedies to this\r\nevil are hazardous. One would be to consolidate the two States into\r\none. Another would be to banish Rhode Island from the Union. A third, to\r\ncompel her submission to the will of the other twelve. A fourth, for the\r\nother twelve to govern themselves according to the new propositions, and\r\nto let Rhode Island go on by herself according to the ancient articles.\r\nBut the dangers and difficulties attending all these remedies are obvious.\r\n\r\nThese are the only alterations proposed to the confederation, and the\r\nlast of them is the only additional power which Congress is thought to\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n12. Congress have not yet ultimately decided at what rates they will\r\nredeem the paper money in the hands of the holders. But a resolution of\r\n1784 has established the principle, so that there can be little doubt but\r\nthat the holders of paper money will receive as much real money as the\r\npaper was actually worth at the time they received it, and an interest\r\nof six per cent. from the time they received it. Its worth will be found\r\nin the depreciation table of the State wherein it was received; these\r\ndepreciation tables having been formed according to the market price of\r\nthe paper money at different epochs.\r\n\r\n13. Those who talk of the bankruptcy of the United States, are of two\r\ndescriptions: 1. Strangers who do not understand the nature and history\r\nof our paper money. 2. Holders of that paper money who do not wish that\r\nthe world should understand it. Thus, when in March, 1780, the paper\r\nmoney being so far depreciated that forty dollars of it would purchase\r\nonly one silver dollar, Congress endeavored to correct the progress of\r\nthat depreciation by declaring they would emit no more, and would redeem\r\nwhat was in circulation at the rate of one dollar of silver for forty of\r\npaper; this was called by the brokers in paper money, a bankruptcy. Yet\r\nthese very people who had only given one dollar's worth of provisions,\r\nof manufactures, or perhaps of silver, for their forty dollars, were\r\ndispleased that they could not in a moment multiply their silver into\r\nforty. If it were decided that the United States should pay a silver\r\ndollar for every paper dollar they emitted, I am of opinion (conjecturing\r\nfrom loose data of my memory only as to the amount and true worth of the\r\nsums emitted by Congress and by the several States) that a debt, which\r\nin its just amount is not more, perhaps, than six millions of dollars,\r\nwould amount up to four hundred millions, and instead of assessing every\r\ninhabitant with a debt of about two dollars, would fix on him thirty\r\nguineas, which is considerably more than the national debt of England\r\naffixes on each of its inhabitants, and would make a bankruptcy where\r\nthere is none. The real just debts of the United States, which were\r\nstated under the third query, will be easily paid by the sale of their\r\nlands, which were ceded on the fundamental condition of being applied\r\nas a sinking fund for this purpose.\r\n\r\n14. The whole army of the United States was disbanded at the close of\r\nthe war. A few guards only were engaged for their magazines. Lately they\r\nhave enlisted some two or three regiments to garrison the posts along\r\nthe Northern boundary of the United States.\r\n\r\n16. The United States do not own, at present, a single vessel of war;\r\nnor has Congress entered into any resolution on that subject.\r\n\r\n17. I conjecture there are six hundred and fifty thousand negroes in\r\nthe five southernmost States, and not fifty thousand in the rest. In\r\nmost of these latter, effectual measures have been taken for their\r\nfuture emancipation. In the former, nothing is done towards that. The\r\ndisposition to emancipate them is strongest in Virginia. Those who\r\ndesire it, form, as yet, the minority of the whole State, but it bears\r\na respectable portion to the whole in numbers and weight of character,\r\nand it is continually recruiting by the addition of nearly the whole of\r\nthe young men as fast as they come into public life. I flatter myself\r\nit will take place there at some period of time not very distant. In\r\nMaryland and North Carolina a very few are disposed to emancipate. In\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, not the smallest symptom of it, but, on the\r\ncontrary, these two States, and North Carolina, continue importations\r\nof negroes. These have been long prohibited in all the other States.\r\n\r\n18. In Virginia, where a great proportion of the legislature consider the\r\nconstitution but as other acts of legislation, laws have been frequently\r\npassed which controlled its effects. I have not heard that in the other\r\nStates they have ever infringed their constitution, and I suppose they\r\nhave not done it, as the Judges would consider any law as void which was\r\ncontrary to the constitution. Pennsylvania is divided into two parties\r\nvery nearly equal, the one desiring to change the constitution, the\r\nother opposing a change. In Virginia there is a part of the State which\r\nconsiders the act for organizing their government as a constitution, and\r\nare content to let it remain; there is another part which considers it\r\nonly as an ordinary act of the legislature, who, therefore, wish to form\r\na real constitution, correcting some defects which have been observed in\r\nthe act now in force. Most of the young people as they come into office\r\narrange themselves on this side, and I think they will prevail ere long.\r\nBut there are no heats on this account. I do not know that any of the\r\nother States propose to change their constitution.\r\n\r\n19. I have heard of no malversations in office which have been of any\r\nconsequence, unless we consider as such some factious transactions in the\r\nPennsylvania Assembly; or some acts of the Virginia Assembly which have\r\nbeen contrary to their constitution. The causes of these were explained\r\nin the preceding article.\r\n\r\n20. Broils among the States may happen in the following ways: 1. A State\r\nmay be embroiled with the other twelve by not complying with the lawful\r\nrequisitions of Congress. 2. Two States may differ about their boundaries.\r\nBut the method of settling these is fixed by the confederation, and most\r\nof the States which have any differences of this kind, are submitting\r\nthem to this mode of determination, and there is no danger of opposition\r\nto the decree by any State. The individuals interested may complain, but\r\nthis can produce no difficulty. 3. Other contestations may arise between\r\ntwo States, such as pecuniary demands, affrays among their citizens, and\r\nwhatever else may arise between any two nations, with respect to these,\r\nthere are two opinions. One that they are to be decided according to the\r\nninth article of the confederation, which says that Congress shall be the\r\nlast resort in all differences between two or more States, concerning\r\nboundary jurisdiction, _or any other cause whatever_; and prescribes\r\nthe mode of decision, and the weight of reason is undoubtedly in favor\r\nof this opinion, yet there are some who question it.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the decisions of Congress are impotent because\r\nthe confederation provides no compulsory power. But when two or more\r\nnations enter into compact, it is not usual for them to say what shall\r\nbe done to the party who infringes it. Decency forbids this, and it is\r\nas unnecessary as indecent, because the right of compulsion naturally\r\nresults to the party injured by the breach. When any one State in the\r\nAmerican Union refuses obedience to the confederation by which they\r\nhave bound themselves, the rest have a natural right to compel them to\r\nobedience. Congress would probably exercise long patience before they\r\nwould recur to force; but if the case ultimately required it, they would\r\nuse that recurrence. Should this case ever arise, they will probably\r\ncoerce by a naval force, as being more easy, less dangerous to liberty,\r\nand less likely to produce much bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, too, that our governments, both federal and particular,\r\nwant energy; that it is difficult to restrain both individuals and States\r\nfrom committing wrong. This is true, and it is an inconvenience. On the\r\nother hand, that energy which absolute governments derive from an armed\r\nforce, which is the effect of the bayonet constantly held at the breast\r\nof every citizen, and which resembles very much the stillness of the\r\ngrave, must be admitted also to have its inconveniences. We weigh the two\r\ntogether, and like best to submit to the former. Compare the number of\r\nwrongs committed with impunity by citizens among us with those committed\r\nby the sovereign in other countries, and the last will be found most\r\nnumerous, most oppressive on the mind, and most degrading of the dignity\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n22. The States differed very much in their proceedings as to British\r\nproperty, and I am unable to give the details. In Virginia, the sums\r\nsequestered in the treasury remain precisely as they did at the conclusion\r\nof the peace. The British having refused to make satisfaction for the\r\nslaves they carried away, contrary to the treaty of peace, and to deliver\r\nup the ports within our limits, the execution of that treaty is in some\r\ndegree suspended. Individuals, however, are paying off their debts to\r\nBritish subjects, and the laws even permit the latter to recover them\r\njudicially. But as the amount of these debts are twenty or thirty times\r\nthe amount of all the money in circulation in that State, the same laws\r\npermit the debtor to pay his debts in seven equal and annual payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_Notes on M.

Soulés._\r\n\r\nI am unable to say what was the number of Americans engaged in the affair\r\nof Bunker's Hill. I am able, however, to set right a gross falsehood of\r\nAndrews. He says the Americans there engaged were constantly relieved by\r\nfresh hands. This is entirely untrue. Bunker's Hill (or rather Breed's\r\nhill whereon the action was) is a peninsular joined to the main land by\r\na neck of land almost level with the water, a few paces wide, and about\r\none or two hundred toises long. On one side of this neck lay a vessel\r\nof war, and on the other several gun-boats. The body of our army was on\r\nthe main land, and only a detachment had been sent into the peninsular.\r\nWhen the enemy determined to make the attack, they sent the vessel of\r\nwar and gun-boats to take the position, before mentioned, to cut off all\r\nreinforcements, which they effectually did. Not so much as a company\r\ncould venture to the relief of the men engaged, who therefore fought\r\nthrough the whole action, and at length were obliged to retire across\r\nthe neck through the cross-fire of the vessels before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"On the fall of Montgomery and his aids at Quebec, there were present\r\nColonel Campbell and Major Dubois. Campbell, though having the rank of\r\ncolonel, was only of the staff; Dubois was of the line. The usage of\r\nall nations, therefore, authorized the latter to take the command. But\r\nit was a case for which Congress had not yet provided. Campbell availed\r\nhimself of this; and believing, on the sight of blood, that all was\r\nlost, ordered a retreat.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech to the Indians, in Andrews', page 357, is a little altered\r\nand abridged. You will find the genuine one in the Journal of Congress,\r\nof July, 1775. I do not distinctly enough recollect the anecdote of the\r\nold man's company, related by Andrews, to affirm it in all its parts.\r\nI think I recollect in general that there was such a company.\r\n\r\nThe questions relative to General Thomas, I could only have answered\r\nindistinctly from my own memory: but fortunately there came to Paris a\r\nfew days ago, and will yet continue there a few days, a Colonel Blackden,\r\nan American officer of good understanding and of truth, and who was\r\nat the latter part of the affair of Quebec. He was at the surprise of\r\nTiconderoga by Allen, and continued with the army until 1781. I have\r\nspoken with him on this subject, and find that he possesses treasures\r\nof details, which will be precious to M. Soulés. Any day that M. Soulés\r\nwill do me the honor to come and take a _famille soupe_ with me, (after\r\nthe 16th instant,) if he will give me notice in the morning, I will ask\r\nColonel Blackden to meet him here, and will make them acquainted. He is\r\nperfectly disposed to give all the information in his power to M. Soulés,\r\nand whatever he gives may be relied on. To him, then, I shall refer M.\r\nSoulés for answers to his military questions, and will wait his orders,\r\nrecommending despatch, as Colonel Blackden has not long to stay.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act was passed in February, 1765.\r\n\r\nWhat powers the Parliament might rightfully exercise over us, and whether\r\nany, had never been declared either by them or us. They had very early\r\ntaken the gigantic step of passing the Navigation Act. The colonies\r\nremonstrated violently against it, and one of them, Virginia, when she\r\ncapitulated to the commonwealth of England, expressly capitulated for a\r\nfree trade. [See the articles on the Notes on Virginia, p. 201.] This\r\ncapitulation, however, was as little regarded as the original right,\r\nrestored by it, had been. The navigation act was re-enacted by Charles,\r\nand was enforced. And we had been so long in the habit of seeing them\r\nconsider us merely as objects for the extension of their _commerce_, and\r\nof submitting to every duty or regulation imposed with that view, that\r\nwe had ceased to complain of them. But when they proposed to consider us\r\nas objects of _taxation_, all the States took the alarm. Yet so little\r\nhad we attended to this subject, that our advocates did not at first\r\nknow on what ground to take their stand. Mr. Dickenson, a lawyer of\r\nmore ingenuity than sound judgment, and still more timid than ingenious,\r\nnot daring to question the authority to regulate commerce so as best to\r\nanswer their own purpose, to which we had so long submitted, admitted\r\nthat authority in its utmost extent. He acknowledged * * * * * that they\r\ncould levy duties, internal or external, payable in Great Britain or in\r\nthe States. He only required that these duties should be bonâ fide for\r\nthe _regulation_ of commerce, and not to raise a solid _revenue_. He\r\nadmitted, therefore, that they might control our commerce, but not tax\r\nus. This mysterious system took, for a moment, in America as well as in\r\nEurope. But sounder heads saw in the first moment, that he who could put\r\ndown the loom, could stop the spinning wheel, and he who could stop the\r\nspinning wheel could tie the hands which turned it. They saw that this\r\nflimsey fabric could not be supported. Who were to be judges whether\r\nduties were imposed with a view to burthen and suppress a branch of\r\nmanufacture, or to raise a revenue? If either party, exclusively of the\r\nother, it was plain where that would end. If both parties, it was plain\r\nwhere that would end also. They saw, therefore, no sure clue to lead\r\nthem out of their difficulties but reason and right. They dared to follow\r\nthem, assured that they alone could lead them to defensible ground. The\r\nfirst elements of reason showed that the members of Parliament could have\r\nno power which the people of the several counties had not. That these\r\nhad naturally a power over their own farms, and, collectively, over all\r\nEngland. That if they had any power over counties out of England, it must\r\nbe founded on compact or force. No compact could be shown, and neither\r\nparty chose to bottom their pretensions on force. It was objected that\r\nthis annihilated the navigation act. True, it does. The navigation act,\r\ntherefore, becomes a proper subject of treaty between the two nations.\r\nOr if Great Britain does not choose to have its basis questioned, let\r\nus go on as we have done. Let no new shackles be imposed, and we will\r\ncontinue to submit to the old. We will consider the restrictions on\r\nour commerce, now actually existing, as compensations yielded by us for\r\nthe protection and privileges we actually enjoy, only trusting that if\r\nGreat Britain, on a revisal of these restrictions, is sensible that some\r\nof them are useless to her and oppressive to us, she will repeal them.\r\nBut on this she shall be free. Place us in the condition we were when\r\nthe king came to the throne, let us rest so, and we will be satisfied.\r\nThis was the ground on which all the States very soon found themselves\r\nrallied, and that there was no other which could be defended.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed with remarks on the history. I do not think that M.\r\nSoulés mentioned the affair of the Cedars, which happened in April, 1775.\r\nThis was an affair of no small importance. A committee was appointed by\r\nCongress to institute inquiries concerning it, as may be seen by the\r\njournal of June 14, 1776. The report of that committee is inserted in\r\nthe journal of July the 10th, and I can assure M. Soulés, that the facts\r\ntherein stated were proved unhesitatingly to the committee by witnesses\r\npresent at the transactions, and who were on watch. I have the originals\r\nof that inquiry in my possession in America. The Captain Foster therein\r\nmentioned, was afterwards taken with Burgoyne's army, though permitted\r\nto go at large on his parole. He was not received into any American\r\ncompany, nor did the British officers, his fellow-prisoners, choose to\r\nbe seen in company with him--so detestable had been the transaction,\r\n&c. Vol. i. p. 324. I have been very well informed, that during all\r\nthe latter part of the defence, the garrison were obliged to return the\r\ncannon balls of the enemy, with which, indeed, the ground was covered,\r\nhaving none of their own left.\r\n\r\nPage 325. \"Il Peut un Serjent,\" &c. This particular truly related in\r\nAndrews.\r\n\r\nPage 5. \"Ils en vinrent,\" &c. See the journal of Congress. That it was\r\non that day put off to the 1st of July. This was done at the instance\r\nof the members opposed to it. The friends of the resolution objected,\r\nthat if it were not agreed to till the 1st of July, they would after\r\nthat have to frame a Declaration of Independence, and that more time\r\nwould then be lost. It was therefore agreed between the two, that the\r\nresolution should be put off till the 1st of July; and that a committee\r\nshould be immediately appointed to draw a Declaration of Independence,\r\nconformable to the resolution, should it be adopted. A committee was\r\naccordingly appointed the next day. On the 1st of July the resolution\r\nwas proposed, and when ready for a vote, a State required it to be put\r\noff till the next day. It was done, and was passed the next day, 2d of\r\nJuly. The Declaration of Independence was debated the 2d, 3d and 4th\r\ndays of July, and on the last of these was passed and signed.\r\n\r\nPage 6th. A \"se retirèrent ensuite du Congres.\" I do not remember that\r\nthe delegates of Maryland retired from Congress, and I think I could not\r\nhave forgotten such a fact. On the contrary, I find by the journal of\r\nCongress, that they were present, and acting on the 11th, 12th, 17th,\r\n18th and 24th of June.\r\n\r\nPage 7. A \"la plus grande partie.\" It should rather be the most important\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nPage 7, 6. \"Les états ferraient encore aujourd'hui partie de l'empire\r\nBritannique.\" M. Soulés may be assured that the submission of the States\r\ncould not have been effected but by a long course of disasters, and such,\r\ntoo, as were irreparable in their nature. Their resources were great,\r\nand their determination so rooted, that they would have tried the last\r\nof them. I am as satisfied as I can be of anything, that the conjecture\r\nhere stated would not have been verified by the event.\r\n\r\nPage 14. \"Provinces unis,\" should not this always be \"états unis?\"\r\n\r\nPage 15. \"Mais qu'on pouvoir aussi les interpreter,\" &c. His exact answer\r\nwas, \"That it was true the, &c. might include _anything_, but that might\r\nalso include _nothing_.\"\r\n\r\nPage 16. \"Tant de confiance,\" &c. Their main confidence was in their own\r\nresources. They considered foreign aid as probable and desirable, but\r\nnot essential. I believe myself, from the whole of what I have seen of\r\nour resources and perseverance, that had we never received any foreign\r\naid, we should not have obtained our independence. But that we should\r\nhave made a peace with Great Britain on any terms we pleased short of\r\nthat, which would have been a subjection to the same king, a union of\r\nforce in war, &c. 2. That had France supplied us plentifully with money,\r\nsuppose about four millions of guineas a year, without entering into the\r\nwar herself at all, we should have established our independence, but it\r\nwould have cost more time and blood, but less money. 3. That France,\r\naiding us as she did, with money and forces, shortened much the time,\r\nlessened the expense of blood, but at a greater expense of money to her\r\nthan would have otherwise been requisite.\r\n\r\nPage 18. \"_L'extremité_ septentrional,\" &c. I think the word \"cotè\"\r\nwould be better adapted than \"extremité\" to the form of the island.\r\n\r\nPage 21. \"3000 hommes,\" inquire of Colonel Blackden.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the propositions of Congress to the Hessians may be worth\r\nmentioning. See their journals, 1776, Aug. 14.\r\n\r\nI will make a general observation here on the events of Long Island,\r\nNew York, &c., at this time. The maxim laid down by Congress to their\r\ngenerals was, that not a foot of territory was to be ceded to their\r\nenemies where there was a possibility of defending it. In consequence\r\nof these views, and against his own judgment, General Washington was\r\nobliged to fortify and attempt to defend the city of New York. But that\r\ncould not be defended without occupying the heights on Long Island which\r\ncommanded the city of New York. He was therefore obliged to establish\r\na strong detachment in Long Island to defend those heights. The moment\r\nthat detachment was routed, which he had much expected, his first object\r\nwas to withdraw them, and his second to evacuate New York. He did this,\r\ntherefore, immediately, and without waiting any movement of the enemy.\r\nHe brought off his whole baggage, stores and other implements, without\r\nleaving a single article except the very heaviest of his cannon and\r\nthings of little value. I well remember his letter to Congress, wherein\r\nhe expressed his wonder that the enemy had given him this leisure, as,\r\nfrom the heights they had got possession of, they might have compelled\r\nhim to a very precipitate retreat. This was one of the instances where\r\nour commanding officers were obliged to conform to popular views, though\r\nthey foresaw certain loss from it. Had he proposed at first to abandon\r\nNew York, he might have been abandoned himself. An obedience to popular\r\nwill cost us an army in Charleston in the year 1779.\r\n\r\nPage 30. \"Une fuite precipiteé.\" It was a leisurely retreat as I have\r\nbefore observed.\r\n\r\nPage 41. \"Que je n'ai prie obtener que d'un anglais.\" Colonel Blackden\r\ncan probably give M. Soulés good intelligence on this affair. I think\r\nI recollect the slaughter on Kniphauser's side to have been very great.\r\n\r\nVolume 3. \"Si dans son institution,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis is a luminous idea, and worthy of being a little more developed.\r\nIt places the question between Great Britain and America in the simplest\r\nform possible. No Englishman will pretend that a right to participate in\r\ngovernment can be derived from any other source than a personal right,\r\nor a right of property. The conclusion is inevitable that he, who had\r\nneither his _person_ nor _property_ in America, could rightfully assume\r\na participation in its government.\r\n\r\nPage 17. The seeds of the war are here traced to their true source. The\r\ntory education of the King was the first preparation for that change\r\nin the British government which that party never ceases to wish. This\r\nnaturally ensured tory administrations during his life. At the moment\r\nhe came to the throne and cleared his hands of his enemies by the peace\r\nof Paris, the assumptions of unwarrantable right over America commenced.\r\nThey were so signal, and followed one another so close, as to prove they\r\nwere part of a system, either to reduce it under absolute subjection,\r\nand thereby make it an instrument for attempts on Britain itself, or\r\nto sever it from Britain, so that it might not be a weight in the whig\r\nscale. This latter alternative, however, was not considered as the one\r\nwhich would take place. They knew so little of America, that they thought\r\nit unable to encounter the little finger of Great Britain. M. de Soulés\r\nhas well developed this subject. He is best judge whether anything more\r\nneed be said on this subject.\r\n\r\nPage 43. \"Se le ministere anglais avoit eu la patience d'attendre,\" &c.\r\n\r\nHaving seen and intimately known the positions of the Americans at that\r\nmoment, I am certain that this conjecture would not have been verified.\r\nThe determined resolution with which they met every effort of the\r\nministry, whether made in the form of force, fraud, or persuasion, gives\r\nus a moral certainty they would have been equally immoveable, if tried\r\nin the way of privation here proposed.\r\n\r\nPage 51. The substitution of Gage for Hutchinson was not intended as\r\na favor, but, by putting the civil government into military hands, was\r\nmeant to show they would enforce their measures by arms. See page 109,\r\nwhere Congress makes it one of their grievances.\r\n\r\nPage 102. \"Plusieurs criminals,\" &c. Notwithstanding the laws the English\r\nmade, I think they never ventured to carry a single person to be tried\r\nin England. They knew that reprisals would be made, and probably on the\r\nperson of the governor who ventured on the measure.\r\n\r\nPage 149. The fact that the English commenced hostilities at Lexington\r\nbeing proved beyond question by us, and even acknowledged by the English,\r\njustice requires it should be plainly asserted and left clear of doubt.\r\nFew of the facts which history asserts and relies on, have been so well\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nPage 150. \"L'humanité des Britons.\" I doubt whether this is the character\r\nof the nation in general. But this history, and every one which is\r\nimpartial, must in its relation of this war show, in such repeated\r\ninstances, that they conducted it, both in theory and practice, on the\r\nmost barbarous principles, that the expression here cited will stand\r\nin contradiction to the rest of the work. As examples of their theory,\r\nrecollect the act of Parliament for constraining our prisoners, taken\r\non the sea, to bear arms against their fathers, brothers, &c. For their\r\npractice, recollect the exciting the savages against us, insurrections\r\nof our slaves, sending our prisoners to the East Indies, killing them in\r\nprison ships, keeping them on half rations, and of the most unwholesome\r\nquality, cruel murders of unarmed individuals of every sex, massacres\r\nof those in arms after they had asked quarters, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nPage 150. \"A cé que l'on dét à 20,000 hommes.\" It was of 22,000 men.\r\nI was in a situation to know the fact from General Washington's own\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nPage 158. 1. 8. Strike out \"ét probablement,\" and insert \"mais\r\nveritablement.\" I remember the fact well, and the leading persons of\r\nConnecticut, and particularly their delegates in Congress made no secret,\r\nthat their object was to overawe New York into its duty. Page 159. \"Et\r\nfut resolvè de la reduire [_i. e._, nouvelle York] en cendre.\" This was\r\nproposed and considered in Congress, but they refused to come to this\r\nresolution, nor do I recollect that any other body resolved it.\r\n\r\nPage 163. _Doctor_ Franklin has been called by that title as early as\r\n1760, within my own knowledge; I do not know how much longer.\r\n\r\nHis quality in France was that of Minister Plenipotentiary, and not as\r\nAmbassador. We have never appointed an Ambassador. France offered to\r\nreceive one.\r\n\r\nPage 166. The English set fire to Charleston. Query, as to the number\r\nof their killed.\r\n\r\nPage 180. 181. Gates was and still is an inhabitant of Virginia. He\r\nnever lived in any other State.\r\n\r\nPage 190. \"M. Arnold avoit formé une entreprise,\" &c. I never understood\r\nthat he formed this enterprise, nor do I believe he did. I heard and\r\nsaw all General Washington's letters on this subject. I do not think he\r\nmentioned Arnold as author of the proposition, yet he was always just\r\nin ascribing to every officer the merit of his own works; and he was\r\ndisposed particularly in favor of Arnold. This officer is entitled to\r\ngreat merit in the execution, but to ascribe to him that of having formed\r\nthe enterprise, is probably to ascribe to him what belongs to General\r\nWashington or some other person.\r\n\r\nPage 209. \"Et qu' il ne leur fut plus permis de lever la milice, &c.\" They\r\nhad formerly had a law on the subject of invasions and insurrections,\r\nwhich was of a perpetual tenor. They altered this law by one which was\r\nto be in force for a certain term of years only. That term of years\r\neffluxed at this time, the altering law expired, and therefore, the\r\nold one resumed its vigor. It was very imperfect, yet they chose to act\r\nunder the color of that rather than without any color of law.\r\n\r\nPage 216. \"Dont elles se plaignorent.\" This seems to be the proper place\r\nto rectify a small error in the arrangement of facts, and to state the\r\nanswer to the conciliatory proposition, which was, in truth, the first\r\nwork of the Assembly. I have not here the journals of the Assembly,\r\nbut there are certain circumstances which render it impossible for my\r\nmemory to lead me astray. I was under appointment to attend the general\r\nCongress; but knowing the importance of the answer to be given to the\r\nconciliatory proposition, and that our leading whig characters were\r\nthen in Congress, I determined to attend on the Assembly, and, though\r\na young member, to take on myself the carrying through an answer to the\r\nproposition. The Assembly met the 1st of June. I drew and proposed the\r\nanswer, and carried it through the house with very little alteration,\r\nagainst the opposition of our timid members who wish to speak a different\r\nlanguage. This was finished before the 11th of June, because on that\r\nday, I set out from Williamsburg to Philadelphia, and was the bearer of\r\nan authenticated copy of this instrument to Congress. The effect it had\r\nin fortifying their minds, and in deciding their measures, renders its\r\ntrue date important; because only Pennsylvania had as yet answered the\r\nproposition. Virginia was the second. It was known how Massachusetts\r\nwould answer it, and the example of these three principal colonies would\r\ndetermine the measures of all the others, and of course the fate of the\r\nproposition. Congress received it therefore, with much satisfaction. The\r\nAssembly of Virginia did not deliver the answer to Lord Dunmore till\r\nlate in the session. They supposed it would bring on a dissolution of\r\ntheir body whenever they should deliver it to him; and they wished\r\npreviously to get some important acts passed. For this reason they kept\r\nit up. I think that Lord Dunmore did not quit the Metropolis till he\r\nknew that the answer framed by the house was a rejection of the\r\nproposition, though that answer was not yet communicated to him regularly.\r\n\r\nPage 231. \"Quelques certaines de blancs.\" These were composed principally\r\nof Scotch merchants and factors, and some few English, who had settled\r\nin the country. I doubt whether there was a single native among them. If\r\nM. Soulés could therefore characterize more particularly who they were\r\nwho joined Lord Dunmore, it would be an agreeable act of justice to the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nPage 283. \"Les Americains qui avoit joint Milord Dunmore.\" The same\r\nobservation applies to this.\r\n\r\nPage 245. \"Pendant l'eté, le congres general avoit eté occupé à dresser\r\nun plan pour former une confederation.\" It is necessary to set to rights\r\nhere a fact which has been mistaken by every person who has written on\r\nthis subject. I will do it from a perfect recollection of facts, but my\r\nmemory does not enable me to state the date exactly. I was absent from\r\nCongress from the beginning of January, 1776, to the middle of May.\r\nEither just before I left Congress, or immediately on my return to it,\r\n(I rather think it was the former,) Doctor Franklin put into my hands\r\nthe draught of a plan of Confederation, desiring me to read it, and\r\ntell him what I thought of it. I approved it highly. He showed it to\r\nothers. Some thought as I did; others were revolted at it. We found it\r\ncould not be passed, and the proposing it to Congress as the subject for\r\nany vote whatever would startle many members so much, that they would\r\nsuspect we had lost sight of reconciliation with Great Britain, and that\r\nwe should lose much more ground than we should gain by the proposition.\r\nYet, that the idea of a more firm bond of union than the undefined one\r\nunder which we then acted might be suggested and permitted to grow,\r\nDoctor Franklin informed Congress that he had sketched the outlines of an\r\ninstrument which might become necessary at a future day, if the minority\r\ncontinued pertinacious, and would ask leave for it to lay on the table of\r\nCongress, that the members might in the meantime be turning the subject\r\nin their minds, and have something more perfect prepared by the time it\r\nshould become necessary. This was agreed to by the timid members, only\r\non condition, that no entry whatever should be made in the journals of\r\nCongress relative to this instrument. This was to continue in force only\r\ntill a reconciliation with Great Britain. This was all that ever was done\r\nor proposed in Congress on the subject of a Confederation before June\r\n1776, when the proposition was regularly made to Congress, a committee\r\nappointed to draw an instrument of Confederation, who accordingly drew\r\none, very considerably differing from the sketch of Doctor Franklin.\r\n\r\nPage 294. \"Il est á croire qu'il y avoit quelque convention.\" It is well\r\nknown that there was such a convention. It was never made a secret of,\r\non our part. I do not exactly recollect its terms, but I believe they\r\nwere what M. Soulés states.\r\n\r\nPage 301. \"La petite verole.\" I have been informed by officers who were\r\non the spot, and whom I believe myself, that this disorder was sent into\r\nour army designedly by the commanding officer in Quebec. It answered\r\nhis purpose effectually.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_Observations on the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes, to Monsieur\r\nJefferson, dated Fontainebleau, October 22d, 1786._\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed, in the course of the last year, to take a\r\nview of the subjects of commerce which might be brought from the United\r\nStates of America, in exchange for those of France, and to consider what\r\nadvantages and facilities might be offered to encourage that commerce.\r\nThe letter of Monsieur de Calonnes was founded on their report. It\r\nwas conclusive as to the articles on which satisfactory information\r\nhad been then obtained, and reserved for future consideration certain\r\nothers needing further enquiry. It is proposed, now, to review those\r\nunfinished articles, that they also may be comprehended in the Arrêt,\r\nand the regulations on this branch of commerce be rendered complete.\r\n\r\n1st. The letter promises to diminish the Droits du roi et d'amirauté,\r\npayable by an American vessel entering into a port of France, and to\r\nreduce what should remain into a single duty, which shall be regulated by\r\nthe draught of the vessel, or her number of masts. It is doubted whether\r\nit will be expedient to regulate the duty in either of these ways. If by\r\nthe draught of water, it will fall unequally on us as a Nation; because\r\nwe build our vessels sharp-bottomed, for swift sailing, so that they draw\r\nmore water than those of other nations, of the same burthen; if by the\r\nnumber of masts, it will fall unequally on individuals, because we often\r\nsee ships of one hundred and eighty tons, and brigs of three hundred\r\nand sixty. This, then, would produce an inequality among individuals of\r\nsix to one. The present principle is the most just, to regulate by the\r\nburthen.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly desirable that these duties should be reduced to a single\r\none. Their names and numbers perplex and harass the merchant more than\r\ntheir amount, subject him to imposition, and to the suspicion of it where\r\nthere is none. An intention of general reformation in this article has\r\nbeen accordingly announced[16] with augmentation as to foreigners. We\r\nare in hopes that this augmentation is not to respect us; because it is\r\nproposed as a measure of reciprocity; whereas, in some of our States no\r\nsuch duties exist, and in others they are extremely light; because we have\r\nbeen made to hope a diminution instead of augmentation; and because this\r\ndistinction cannot draw on France any just claims from other nations, the\r\n_Jura gentis amicissimæ_ conferred by her late treaties having reference\r\nexpressly to the nations of Europe only; and those conferred by the\r\nmore ancient ones not being susceptible of any other interpretation, nor\r\nadmitting a pretension of reference to a nation which did not then exist,\r\nand which has come into existence under circumstances distinguishing\r\nits commerce from that of all other nations. Merchandise received from\r\nthem take employment from the poor of France; ours give it; theirs is\r\nbrought in the last stage of manufacture, ours in the first; we bring\r\nour tobaccoes to be manufactured into snuff, our flax and hemps into\r\nlinen and cordage, our furs into hats, skins into saddlery, shoes, and\r\nclothing; we take nothing till it has received the last hand.\r\n\r\n2d. Fish-oils. The Hanseatic treaty was the basis on which the diminution\r\nof duty on this article was asked and granted. It is expressly referred\r\nto as such in the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes. Instead, however, of\r\nthe expression \"huile et graisse de baleine and d'autres poissons\" used\r\nin that treaty, the letter uses the terms \"huiles de baleine, spermaceti,\r\net tout ce qui est compris sous ces denominations.\" And the farmers have\r\navailed themselves of this variation to refuse the diminution of duty on\r\nthe oils of the vache marine, chien de mer, esturgeon, and other fish.\r\nIt is proposed, therefore, to re-establish in the Arrêt the expressions\r\nof the Hanseatic treaty, and to add from the same treaty the articles\r\n\"baleine coupee et fanon de baleine.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter states these regulations as finally made by the King. The\r\nmerchants on this supposition entered into speculations. But they found\r\nthemselves called on for the old duties, not only on other fish oils, but\r\non the whale oil. Monsieur de Calonnes always promised that the Arrêt\r\nshould be retrospective to the date of the letter, so as to refund to\r\nthem the duties they had thus been obliged to pay. To this attention\r\nis prayed in forming the Arrêt. His majesty having been pleased, as\r\nan encouragement to the importation of our fish oils, to abolish the\r\nDroits de fabrication, it is presumed that the purpose [17]announced of\r\ncontinuing those duties on foreign oils will not be extended to us.\r\n\r\n3d. Rice. The duty on this is only seven and a half deniers the quintal,\r\nor about one-quarter per cent. on its first cost. While this serves to\r\ninform the government of the quantities imported, it cannot discourage\r\nthat importation. Nothing further, therefore, is necessary on this\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n4th. Potash. This article is of principal utility to France in her\r\nbleacheries of linen, glass-works, and soap-works; and the potash of\r\nAmerica, being made of green wood, is known to be the best in the world.\r\nAll duty on it was therefore abolished by the King. But the city of Rouen\r\nlevies on it a duty of twenty sols the quintal, which is very sensible\r\nin its price, brings it dearer to the bleacheries near Paris, to those\r\nof Beauvais, Laval Company, and to the glass-works, and encourages them\r\nto give a preference to the potash or soda of other nations. This is a\r\ncounteraction of the views of the King expressed in the letter, which\r\nit is hoped will be prevented.\r\n\r\n5th. Turpentine, tar, and pitch, were not decided on the former occasion.\r\nTurpentine (Terebenthine) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols the\r\nlivre, making fifteen sols the quintal; which is ten per cent. on its\r\nprime cost. Tar, (goudron, braigras) pays eight livres the leth of twelve\r\nbarrels, and ten sols the livre, amounting to twenty sols the barrel,\r\nwhich is twelve and a half per cent. on its prime cost. Pitch (brai\r\nsec) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols the livre, making fifteen\r\nsols the quintal, which is twenty per cent. on its prime cost. Duties\r\nof from ten to twenty per cent. on articles of heavy carriage, prevent\r\ntheir importation. They eat up all the profits of the merchant, and\r\noften subject him to loss. This has been much the case with respect to\r\nturpentine, tar, and pitch, which are a principal article of remittance\r\nfor the State of North Carolina. It is hoped that it will coincide with\r\nthe views of government in making the present regulations, to suppress\r\nthe duties on these articles, which of all others can bear them least.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [16] Memoires presentées à l'assemblée des Notables, page 53.\r\n\r\n     [17] Memoires presentées ex. page 51, 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n[18]_Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with\r\nthe piratical States of Barbary, November 1786._\r\n\r\n1. It is proposed that the several powers at war with the piratical\r\nStates of Barbary, (or any two or more of them who shall be willing,)\r\nshall enter into a convention to carry on their operations against those\r\nStates in concert, beginning with the Algerines.\r\n\r\n2. This convention shall remain open to any other power who shall, at\r\nany future time, wish to accede to it: the parties reserving a right to\r\nprescribe the conditions of such accession according to the circumstances\r\nexisting at the time it shall be proposed.\r\n\r\n3. The object of the convention shall be to compel the piratical States\r\nto perpetual peace, without price, and to guarantee that peace to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n4. The operations for obtaining that peace shall be constant cruises\r\non their coast, with a naval force to be agreed on. It is not proposed\r\nthat this force shall be so considerable as to be inconvenient to any\r\nparty. It is believed that half a dozen frigates, with as many tenders,\r\nor xebecks, one half of which shall be on cruise while the other half\r\nis at rest, will suffice.\r\n\r\n5. The force agreed to be necessary, shall be furnished by the parties\r\nin certain quotas now to be fixed: it being expected that each will be\r\nwilling to contribute in such proportion as circumstances may render\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n6. As miscarriages often proceed from the want of harmony among officers\r\nof different nations, the parties shall now consider and decide, whether\r\nit shall not be better to contribute their quotas in money, to be employed\r\nin fitting out and keeping on duty, a single fleet of the force agreed\r\non.\r\n\r\n7. The difficulties and delays too, which will attend the management\r\nof these operations, if conducted by the parties themselves separately,\r\ndistant as their courts may be from one another, and incapable of meeting\r\nin consultation, suggest a question whether it will not be better\r\nfor them to give full powers for that purpose to their ambassador or\r\nother minister resident at some one court of Europe, who shall form a\r\ncommittee or council for carrying this convention into effect; wherein\r\nthe vote of each member shall be computed in proportion to the quota\r\nof his sovereign, and the majority, so computed, shall prevail in all\r\nquestions within the view of this convention. The court of Versailles\r\nis proposed, on account of its neighborhood to the Mediterranean, and\r\nbecause all those powers are represented there who are likely to become\r\nparties to this convention.\r\n\r\n8. To save to that council the embarrassment of personal solicitations\r\nfor office, and to assure the parties that their contributions will be\r\napplied solely to the object for which they are destined, there shall be\r\nno establishment of officers for the said council, such as Commissaries,\r\nSecretaries, or of any other kind, with either salaries or perquisites,\r\nnor any other lucrative appointments, but such as whose functions are\r\nto be exercised on board of the said vessels.\r\n\r\n9. Should war arise between any two of the parties to this convention,\r\nit shall not extend to this enterprise, nor interrupt it; but as to this\r\nthey shall be reputed at peace.\r\n\r\n10. When Algiers shall be reduced to peace, the other piratical States,\r\nif they refuse to discontinue their piracies, shall become the objects\r\nof this convention either successively or together, as shall seem best.\r\n\r\n11. Where this convention would interfere with treaties actually existing\r\nbetween any of the parties and of the said States of Barbary, the treaty\r\nshall prevail, and such party shall be allowed to withdraw from the\r\noperations against that State.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [18] [This plan was approved by Portugal, Naples, the\r\n     two Sicilies, Venice, Denmark, and Sweden. France seemed\r\n     favorably disposed. Spain alone, having just concluded\r\n     a treaty with Algiers, was indisposed. In this state of\r\n     things, the plan was communicated to Congress, together\r\n     with information that we would be expected to maintain a\r\n     frigate towards its execution. Unfortunately, the supplies\r\n     of the Treasury were so uncertain, that Congress were not\r\n     willing to enter into an engagement which they might not\r\n     be able to fulfil, and thus the plan failed.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Journal de Paris._\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, August 29, 1787\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am a citizen of the United States of America, and have passed in\r\nthose States almost the whole of my life. When young, I was passionately\r\nfond of reading books of history and travels. Since the commencement of\r\nthe late revolution which separated us from Great Britain, our country\r\ntoo, has been thought worthy to employ the pens of historians and\r\ntravellers. I cannot paint to you, Sir, the agonies which these have\r\ncost me, in obliging me to renounce these favorite branches of reading,\r\nand in discovering to me at length, that my whole life has been employed\r\nin nourishing my mind with fables and falsehoods. For thus I reason. If\r\nthe histories of d'Auberteuil and of Longchamps, and the travels of the\r\nAbbé Robin can be published in the face of the world, and can be read\r\nand believed by those who are cotemporary with the events they pretend\r\nto relate, how may we expect that future ages shall be better informed?\r\nWill those rise from their graves to bear witness to the truth, who would\r\nnot, while living, lift their voices against falsehood? If cotemporary\r\nhistories are thus false, what will future compilations be? And what are\r\nall those of preceding times? In your journal of this day, you announce\r\nand criticise a book under the title of \"les ligues Acheenne, Suisse,\r\n& Hollandoise, et revolution des etats unis d'e l'Amerique par M. de\r\nMayer.\" I was no part of the Achaean, Swiss or Dutch confederacies, and\r\nhave therefore nothing to say against the facts related of them. And\r\nyou cite only one fact from his account of the American revolution. It\r\nis in these words: \"Monsieur Mayer assure qu'une seule voix, un seul\r\nhomme, prononça l'independance des Etats unis. Ce fut, dit il, John\r\nDickinson, un des Deputés de la Pensilvanie au Congrés. La veille, il\r\navoit vôté pour la soumission. L'egalité des suffrages avoit suspendu\r\nla resolution; s'il eut persisté, le Congrés ne deliberoit point, il\r\nfut foible: il ceda aux instances de ceux qui avoient plus d'energie,\r\nplus d'eloquence, et plus de lumieres; il donna sa voix: l'Amerique lui\r\ndoit une reconnaissance eternelle; c'est Dickinson qui l'a affranchie.\"\r\nThe modesty and candor of Mr. Dickinson himself, Sir, would disavow\r\nevery word of this paragraph, except these--\"il avoit voté pour la\r\nsoumission.\" These are true, every other tittle false. I was on the\r\nspot, and can relate to you this transaction with precision. On the\r\n7th of June, 1776, the delegates from Virginia moved, in obedience to\r\ninstructions from their constituents, that Congress should declare the\r\nthirteen united colonies to be independent of Great Britain, that a\r\nconfederation should be formed to bind them together, and measures be\r\ntaken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers. The House ordered\r\na punctual attendance of all their members the next day at ten o'clock,\r\nand then resolved themselves into a committee of the whole and entered\r\non the discussion. It appeared in the course of the debates that seven\r\nStates: viz., New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina and Georgia, were decided for a separation;\r\nbut that six others still hesitated, to wit: New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina. Congress, desirous\r\nof unanimity, and seeing that the public mind was advancing rapidly to\r\nit, referred the further discussion to the first of July, appointing,\r\nin the mean time, a committee to prepare a declaration of independence,\r\na second to form articles for the confederation of the States, and a\r\nthird to propose measures for obtaining foreign aid. On the 28th of\r\nJune, the Declaration of Independence was reported to the House, and was\r\nlaid on the table for the consideration of the members. On the first\r\nday of July, they resolved themselves into a committee of the whole,\r\nand resumed the consideration of the motion of June 7th. It was debated\r\nthrough the day, and at length was decided in the affirmative by the\r\nvote of nine States: viz., New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, _New Jersey_, _Maryland_, Virginia, North Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against it. Delaware,\r\nhaving but two members present, was divided. The delegates from New\r\nYork declared they were for it, and their constituents also; but that\r\nthe instructions against it which had been given them a twelvemonth\r\nbefore, were still unrepealed; that their convention was to meet in a\r\nfew days, and they asked leave to suspend their vote till they could\r\nobtain a repeal of their instructions. Observe that all this was in a\r\ncommittee of the whole Congress, and that according to the mode of their\r\nproceedings, the resolution of that committee to declare themselves\r\nindependent, was to be put to the same persons re-assuming their form as\r\na Congress. It was now evening, the members exhausted by a debate of nine\r\nhours, during which all the powers of the soul had been distended with\r\nthe magnitude of the object--without refreshment, without a pause--and\r\nthe delegates of South Carolina desired that the final decision might\r\nbe put off to the next morning, that they might still weigh in their\r\nown minds their ultimate vote. It was put off, and in the morning of\r\nthe second of July they joined the other nine States in voting for it.\r\nThe members of the Pennsylvania delegation too, who had been absent\r\nthe day before, came in and turned the vote of their State in favor of\r\nindependence; and a third member of the State of Delaware, who, hearing\r\nof the division in the sentiments of his two colleagues, had travelled\r\npost to arrive in time, now came in and decided the vote of that State\r\nalso for the resolution. Thus twelve States voted for it at the time\r\nof its passage, and the delegates of New York, the thirteenth State,\r\nreceived instructions within a few days to add theirs to the general\r\nvote: so that, instead of the \"egalité des suffrages\" spoken of by M.\r\nMayer, there was not a dissenting voice. Congress proceeded immediately\r\nto consider the Declaration of Independence which had been reported by\r\ntheir committee on the 28th of June. The several paragraphs of that were\r\ndebated for three days: viz., the second, third, and fourth of July. In\r\nthe evening of the fourth they were finally closed, and the instrument\r\napproved by an unanimous vote and signed by every member, _except Mr.\r\nDickinson_. Look into the Journal of Congress of that day, Sir, and\r\nyou will see the instrument and the names of the signers, and that Mr.\r\nDickinson's name is not among them. Then read again those words of your\r\npaper: \"il (M. Mayer) assure qu'une seule voix, un seul homme, prononça\r\nl'independance des etats unis, ce fut John Dickinson--l'Amerique lui\r\ndoit une reconnoissance eternel; c'est Dickinson qui l'a affranchie.\"\r\nWith my regrets, and my adieus to history, to travels, to Mayer, and\r\nto you, Sir, permit me to mingle assurances of the great respect with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_Memoranda taken on a journey from Paris into the southern parts of\r\nFrance, and northern of Italy, in the year 1787._\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE. March 3. _Sens_ to _Vermanton_. The face of the country is\r\nin large hills, not too steep for the plough, somewhat resembling the\r\nElk hill, and Beaver-dam hills of Virginia. The soil is generally a rich\r\nmulatto loam, with a mixture of coarse sand and some loose stone. The\r\nplains of the Yonne are of the same color. The plains are in corn, the\r\nhills in vineyard, but the wine not good. There are a few apple trees,\r\nbut none of any other kind, and no inclosures. No cattle, sheep, or\r\nswine; fine mules.\r\n\r\nFew châteaux; no farm-houses, all the people being gathered in villages.\r\nAre they thus collected by that dogma of their religion, which makes them\r\nbelieve, that to keep the Creator in good humor with his own works, they\r\nmust mumble a mass every day? Certain it is, that they are less happy\r\nand less virtuous in villages, than they would be insulated with their\r\nfamilies on the grounds they cultivate. The people are illy clothed.\r\nPerhaps they have put on their worst clothes at this moment, as it is\r\nraining. But I observe women and children carrying heavy burthens, and\r\nlaboring with the hoe. This is an unequivocal indication of extreme\r\npoverty. Men, in a civilized country, never expose their wives and\r\nchildren to labor above their force and sex, as long as their own labor\r\ncan protect them from it. I see few beggars. Probably this is the effect\r\nof a police.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY. March 4. _Lucy le bois._ _Cussy les forges._ _Rouvray._\r\n_Maison-neuve._ _Vitteaux._ _La Chaleure._ _Pont de Panis._ _Dijon._ The\r\nhills are higher and more abrupt. The soil, a good red loam and sand,\r\nmixed with more or less grit, small stone, and sometimes rock. All in\r\ncorn. Some forest wood here and there, broom, whins and holly, and a\r\nfew inclosures of quick hedge. Now and then a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\nThe people are well clothed, but it is Sunday. They have the appearance\r\nof being well fed. The Château de Sevigny, near Cussy les forges, is\r\na charming situation. Between Maisonneuve and Vitteaux the road leads\r\nthrough an avenue of trees, eight American miles long, in a right line.\r\nIt is impossible to paint the ennui of this avenue. On the summits of the\r\nhills which border the valley in which Vitteaux is, there is a parapet\r\nof rock, twenty, thirty, or forty feet perpendicular, which crowns the\r\nhills. The tops are nearly level, and appear to be covered with earth.\r\nVery singular. Great masses of rock in the hills between la Chaleure\r\nand Pont de Panis, and a conical hill in the approach to the last place.\r\n\r\n_Dijon._ The tavern price of a bottle of the best wine (_e. g._ of Vaune)\r\nis four livres. The best round potatoes here I ever saw. They have begun\r\na canal thirty feet wide, which is to lead into the Saone at ----. It\r\nis fed by springs. They are not allowed to take any water out of the\r\nriviere d'Ouche, which runs through this place, on account of the mills\r\non that river. They talk of making a canal to the Seine, the nearest\r\nnavigable part of which at present is fifteen leagues from hence. They\r\nhave very light wagons here for the transportation of their wine. They\r\nare long and narrow; the fore wheels as high as the hind. Two pieces\r\nof wine are drawn by one horse in one of these wagons. The road in this\r\npart of the country is divided into portions of forty or fifty feet by\r\nstones, numbered, which mark the task of the laborers.\r\n\r\nMarch 7 and 8. From _la Baraque_ to _Chagny_. On the left are plains\r\nwhich extend to the Saone, on the right the ridge of mountains called\r\nthe Cote. The plains are of a reddish-brown, rich loam, mixed with much\r\nsmall stone. The Cote has for its basis a solid rock, on which is about\r\na foot of soil and small stone, in equal quantities, the soil red and of\r\nmiddling quality. The plains are in corn; the Cote in vines. The former\r\nhave no inclosures, the latter is in small ones of dry stone wall. There\r\nis a good deal of forest. Some small herds of small cattle and sheep.\r\nFine mules, which come from Provence, and cost twenty louis. They break\r\nthem at two years old, and they last to thirty.\r\n\r\nThe corn lands here rent for about fifteen livres the arpent. They are\r\nnow planting, pruning, and sticking their vines. When a new vineyard is\r\nmade, they plant the vines in gutters about four feet apart. As the vines\r\nadvance, they lay them down. They put out new shoots, and fill all the\r\nintermediate space, till all trace of order is lost. They have ultimately\r\nabout one foot square to each vine. They begin to yield good profit at\r\nfive or six years old, and last one hundred, or one hundred and fifty\r\nyears. A vigneron at Voulenay carried me into his vineyard, which was\r\nof about ten arpents. He told me that some years it produced him sixty\r\npieces of wine, and some, not more than three pieces. The latter is the\r\nmost advantageous produce, because the wine is better in quality, and\r\nhigher in price in proportion as less is made, and the expenses at the\r\nsame time diminish in the same proportion. Whereas, when much is made,\r\nthe expenses are increased, while the price and quality become less.\r\nIn very plentiful years, they often give one half the wine for casks\r\nto contain the other half. The cask for two hundred and fifty bottles,\r\ncosts six livres in scarce years, and ten in plentiful. The Feuillette\r\nis of one hundred and twenty-five bottles, the Piece of two hundred and\r\nfifty, and the Queue or Botte, of five hundred. An arpent rents at from\r\ntwenty to sixty livres. A farmer of ten arpents has about three laborers\r\nengaged by the year. He pays four louis to a man, and half as much to a\r\nwoman, and feeds them. He kills one hog, and salts it, which is all the\r\nmeat used in the family during the year. Their ordinary food is bread\r\nand vegetables. At Pommard and Voulenay, I observed them eating good\r\nwheat bread; at Meursault, rye. I asked the reason of this difference.\r\nThey told me that the white wines fail in quality much oftener than the\r\nred, and remain on hand. The farmer, therefore, cannot afford to feed his\r\nlaborers so well. At Meursault, only white wines are made, because there\r\nis too much stone for the red. On such slight circumstances depends the\r\ncondition of man! The wines which have given such celebrity to Burgundy,\r\ngrow only on the Cote, an extent of about five leagues long, and half a\r\nleague wide. They begin at Chambertin, and go through Vougeau, Romanie,\r\nVeaune, Nuys, Beaune, Pommard, Voulenay, Meursault, and end at Monrachet.\r\nThose of the two last are white, the others red. Chambertin, Vougeau\r\nand Neaune are strongest, and will bear transportation and keeping. They\r\nsell, therefore, on the spot for twelve hundred livres the queue, which\r\nis forty-eight sous the bottle. Voulenay is the best of the other reds,\r\nequal in flavor to Chambertin, &c., but being lighter, will not keep,\r\nand therefore sells for not more than three hundred livres the queue,\r\nwhich is twelve sous the bottle. It ripens sooner than they do, and\r\nconsequently is better for those who wish to broach at a year old. In\r\nlike manner of the white wines, and for the same reason, Monrachet sells\r\nfor twelve hundred livres the queue (forty-eight sous the bottle), and\r\nMeursault of the best quality, viz., the Goutte d'or, at only one hundred\r\nand fifty livres (six sous the bottle). It is remarkable, that the best\r\nof each kind, that is, of the red and white, is made at the extremities\r\nof the line, to wit, at Chambertin and Monrachet. It is pretended that\r\nthe adjoining vineyards produce the same qualities, but that belonging\r\nto obscure individuals, they have not obtained a name, and therefore\r\nsell as other wines. The aspect of the Cote is a little south of east.\r\nThe western side is also covered with vines, and is apparently of the\r\nsame soil, yet the wines are of the coarsest kinds. Such, too, are those\r\nwhich are produced in the plains; but there the soil is richer and less\r\nstrong. Vougeau is the property of the monks of Citeaux, and produces\r\nabout two hundred pieces. Monrachet contains about fifty arpents, and\r\nproduces, one year with another, about one hundred and twenty pieces.\r\nIt belongs to two proprietors only, Monsieur de Clarmont, who leases to\r\nsome wine merchants, and the Marquis de Sarsnet, of Dijon, whose part\r\nis farmed to a Monsieur de la Tour, whose family for many generations\r\nhave had the farm. The best wines are carried to Paris by land. The\r\ntransportation costs thirty-six livres the piece. The more indifferent\r\ngo by water. Bottles cost four and a half sous each.\r\n\r\nMarch 9. _Chalons._ _Sennecy._ _Tournus._ _St. Albin._ _Macon._ On the\r\nleft are the fine plains of the Saone; on the right, high lands, rather\r\nwaving than hilly, sometimes sloping gently to the plains, sometimes\r\ndropping down in precipices, and occasionally broken into beautiful\r\nvallies by the streams which run into the Saone. The plains are a dark\r\nrich loam, in pasture and corn; the heights more or less red or reddish,\r\nalways gritty, of middling quality only, their sides in vines, and their\r\nsummits in corn. The vineyards are inclosed with dry stone walls, and\r\nthere are some quick hedges in the corn grounds. The cattle are few and\r\nindifferent. There are some good oxen, however. They draw by the head.\r\nFew sheep, and small. A good deal of wood lands.\r\n\r\nI passed three times the canal called le Charollois, which they are\r\nopening from Chalons on the Saone to Dijon on the Loire. It passes near\r\nChagny, and will be twenty-three leagues long. They have worked on it\r\nthree years, and will finish it in four more. It will re-animate the\r\nlanguishing commerce of Champagne and Burgundy, by furnishing a water\r\ntransportation for their wines to Nantes, which also will receive new\r\nconsequence by becoming the emporium of that commerce. At some distance\r\non the right are high mountains, which probably form the separation\r\nbetween the waters of the Saone and Loire. Met a malefactor in the hands\r\nof one of the Marechausée; perhaps a dove in the talons of the hawk. The\r\npeople begin now to be in separate establishments, and not in villages.\r\nHouses are mostly covered with tile.\r\n\r\nBEAUJOLOIS. _Maison blanche._ _St. George._ _Château de Laye-Epinaye._\r\nThe face of the country is like that from Chalons to Macon. The plains\r\nare a dark rich loam, the hills a red loam of middling quality, mixed\r\ngenerally with more or less coarse sand and grit, and a great deal of\r\nsmall stone. Very little forest. The vineyards are mostly inclosed with\r\ndry stone wall. A few small cattle and sheep. Here, as in Burgundy, the\r\ncattle are all white.\r\n\r\nThis is the richest country I ever beheld. It is about ten or twelve\r\nleagues in length, and three, four, or five in breadth; at least, that\r\npart of it which is under the eye of the traveller. It extends from\r\nthe top of a ridge of mountains, running parallel with the Saone, and\r\nsloping down to the plains of that river, scarcely any where too steep\r\nfor the plough. The whole is thick set with farm-houses, chateaux, and\r\nthe Bastides of the inhabitants of Lyons. The people live separately, and\r\nnot in villages. The hill sides are in vine and corn; the plains in corn\r\nand pasture. The lands are farmed either for money, or on half-stocks.\r\nThe rents of the corn lands, farmed for money, are about ten or twelve\r\nlivres the arpent. A farmer takes, perhaps, about one hundred and fifty\r\narpents, for three, six, or nine years. The first year they are in corn;\r\nthe second in other small grain, with which he sows red clover. The third\r\nis for the clover. The spontaneous pasturage is of green sward, which\r\nthey call fromenteau. When lands are rented on half-stocks, the cattle,\r\nsheep, &c., are furnished by the landlord. They are valued, and must be\r\nleft of equal value. The increase of these, as well as the produce of\r\nthe farm, is divided equally. These leases are only from year to year.\r\nThey have a method of mixing beautifully the culture of vines, trees,\r\nand corn. Rows of fruit trees are planted about twenty feet apart.\r\nBetween the trees, in the row, they plant vines four feet apart, and\r\nespalier them. The intervals are sowed alternately in corn, so as to\r\nbe one year in corn, the next in pasture, the third in corn, the fourth\r\nin pasture, &c. One hundred toises of vines in length, yield generally\r\nabout four pieces of wine. In Dauphiné, I am told, they plant vines only\r\nat the roots of the trees, and let them cover the whole trees. But this\r\nspoils both the wine and the fruit. Their wine when distilled, yields\r\nbut one-third its quantity in brandy. The wages of a laboring man here,\r\nare five louis; of a woman, one half. The women do not work with the\r\nhoe; they only weed the vines, the corn, &c., and spin. They speak a\r\nPatois very difficult to understand. I passed some time at the Château de\r\nLaye-Epinaye. Monsieur de Laye has a seignory of about fifteen thousand\r\narpents, in pasture, corn, vines, and wood. He has over this, as is\r\nusual, a certain jurisdiction, both criminal and civil. But this extends\r\nonly to the first crude examination, which is before his judges. The\r\nsubject is referred for final examination and decision, to the regular\r\njudicatures of the country. The Seigneur is keeper of the peace on his\r\ndomains. He is therefore subject to the expenses of maintaining it. A\r\ncriminal prosecuted to sentence and execution, costs M. de Laye about five\r\nthousand livres. This is so burthensome to the Seigneurs, that they are\r\nslack in criminal prosecutions. A good effect from a bad cause. Through\r\nall Champagne, Burgundy, and the Beaujolois, the husbandry seems good,\r\nexcept that they manure too little. This proceeds from the shortness of\r\ntheir leases. The people of Burgundy and Beaujolois are well clothed,\r\nand have the appearance of being well fed. But they experience all the\r\noppressions which result from the nature of the general government, and\r\nfrom that of their particular tenures, and of the seignorial government\r\nto which they are subject. What a cruel reflection, that a rich country\r\ncannot long be a free one. M. de Laye has a Diana and Endymion, a very\r\nsuperior morsel of sculpture by Michael Angelo Slodtz, done in 1740.\r\nThe wild gooseberry is in leaf; the wild pear and sweet briar in bud.\r\n\r\n_Lyons._ There are some feeble remains here, of an amphitheatre of two\r\nhundred feet diameter, and of an aqueduct in brick. The Pont d'Ainay\r\nhas nine arches of forty feet from centre to centre. The piers are of\r\nsix feet. The almond is in bloom.\r\n\r\nDAUPHINE. From _St. Fond_ to _Mornas_. March 15, 16, 17, 18. The Rhone\r\nmakes extensive plains, which lie chiefly on the eastern side, and are\r\noften in two stages. Those of Montelimart are three or four miles wide,\r\nand rather good. Sometimes, as in the neighborhood of Vienne, the hills\r\ncome in precipices to the river, resembling then very much our Susquehanna\r\nand its hills, except that the Susquehanna is ten times as wide as the\r\nRhone. The highlands are often very level. The soil, both of hill and\r\nplain, where there is soil, is generally tinged, more or less, with\r\nred. The hills are sometimes mere masses of rock, sometimes a mixture\r\nof loose stone and earth. The plains are always stony, and, as often as\r\notherwise, covered perfectly with a coat of round stones, of the size\r\nof the fist, so as to resemble the remains of inundations, from which\r\nall the soil has been carried away. Sometimes they are middling good,\r\nsometimes barren. In the neighborhood of Lyons, there is more corn than\r\nwine. Towards Tains, more wine than corn. From thence, the plains, where\r\nbest, are in corn, clover, almonds, mulberries, walnuts; where there\r\nis still some earth, they are in corn, almonds, and oaks. The hills are\r\nin vines. There is a good deal of forest-wood near Lyons, but not much\r\nafterwards. Scarcely any inclosures. There are a few small sheep before\r\nwe reach Tains; there the number increases.\r\n\r\nNature never formed a country of more savage aspect, than that on both\r\nsides the Rhone. A huge torrent, rushes like an arrow between high\r\nprecipices, often of massive rock, at other times of loose stone, with\r\nbut little earth. Yet has the hand of man subdued this savage scene,\r\nby planting corn where there is a little fertility, trees where there\r\nis still less, and vines where there is none. On the whole, it assumes\r\na romantic, picturesque, and pleasing air. The hills on the opposite\r\nside of the river, being high, steep, and laid up in terraces, are of\r\na singular appearance. Where the hills are quite in waste, they are\r\ncovered with broom, whins, box, and some clusters of small pines. The\r\nhigh mountains of Dauphiné and Languedoc are now covered with snow. The\r\nalmond is in general bloom, and the willow putting out its leaf. There\r\nwere formerly olives at Pains; but a great cold, some years ago, killed\r\nthem, and they have not been replanted. I am told at Montelimart, that\r\nan almond tree yields about three livres profit a year. Supposing them\r\nthree toises apart, there will be one hundred to the arpent, which gives\r\nthree hundred livres a year, besides the corn growing on the same ground.\r\nA league below Vienne, on the opposite side of the river, is Cote Rotie.\r\nIt is a string of broken hills, extending a league on the river, from the\r\nvillage of Ampuys to the town of Condrieux. The soil is white, tinged\r\na little, sometimes, with yellow, sometimes with red, stony, poor, and\r\nlaid up in terraces. Those parts of the hills only, which look to the\r\nsun at mid-day, or the earlier hours of the afternoon, produce wines\r\nof the first quality. Seven hundred vines, three feet apart, yield a\r\nfeuillette, which is about two and a half pieces, to the arpent. The best\r\nred wine is produced at the upper end, in the neighborhood of Ampuys;\r\nthe best white, next to Condrieux. They sell of the first quality and\r\nlast vintage, at one hundred and fifty livres the piece, equal to twelve\r\nsous the bottle. Transportation to Paris is sixty livres, and the bottle\r\nfour sous; so it may be delivered at Paris in bottles, at twenty sous.\r\nWhen old, it costs ten or eleven louis the piece. There is a quality\r\nwhich keeps well, bears transportation, and cannot be drunk under four\r\nyears. Another must be drunk at a year old. They are equal in flavor\r\nand price.\r\n\r\nThe wine called Hermitage is made on the hills impending over the village\r\nof Tains; on one of which is the hermitage, which gives name to the hills\r\nfor about two miles, and to the wine made on them. There are but three\r\nof those hills which produce wine of the first quality, and of these,\r\nthe middle regions only. They are about three hundred feet perpendicular\r\nheight, three-quarters of a mile in length, and have a southern aspect.\r\nThe soil is scarcely tinged red, consists of small rotten stone, and\r\nis, where the best wine is made, without any perceptible mixture of\r\nearth. It is in sloping terraces. They use a little dung. An homme\r\nde vignes, which consists of seven hundred plants, three feet apart,\r\nyields generally about three quarters of a piece, which is nearly four\r\npieces to the arpent. When new, the piece is sold at about two hundred\r\nand twenty-five livres; when old, at three hundred. It cannot be drunk\r\nunder four years, and improves fastest in a hot situation. There is so\r\nlittle white made in proportion to the red, that it is difficult to buy\r\nit separate. They make the white sell the red. If bought separately, it\r\nis from fifteen to sixteen louis the piece, new, and three livres the\r\nbottle, old. To give quality to the red, they mix one eighth of white\r\ngrapes. Portage to Paris is seventy-two livres the piece, weighing six\r\nhundred pounds. There are but about one thousand pieces of both red and\r\nwhite, of the first quality, made annually. Vineyards are never rented\r\nhere, nor are laborers in the vineyard hired by the year. They leave buds\r\nproportioned to the strength of the vine; sometimes as much as fifteen\r\ninches. The last hermit died in 1751.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Montelimart, and below that, they plant vines in\r\nrows, six, eight, or ten feet apart, and two feet asunder in the row,\r\nfilling the intervals with corn. Sometimes the vines are in double rows,\r\ntwo feet apart. I saw single asses in ploughs proportioned to their\r\nstrength. There are few chateaux in this province. The people, too, are\r\nmostly gathered into villages. There are, however, some scattering farm\r\nhouses. These are made either of mud, or of round stone and mud. They\r\nmake inclosures also, in both those ways. Day laborers receive sixteen or\r\neighteen sous the day, and feed themselves. Those by the year receive,\r\nmen three louis, women half that, and are fed. They rarely eat meat; a\r\nsingle hog salted, being the year's stock for a family. But they have\r\nplenty of cheese, eggs, potatoes and other vegetables, and walnut oil\r\nwith their salad. It is a trade here, to gather dung along the road for\r\ntheir vines. This proves they have few cattle. I have seen neither hares\r\nnor partridges since I left Paris, nor wild fowl on any of the rivers.\r\nThe roads from Lyons to St. Rambert, are neither paved nor gravelled.\r\nAfter that, they are coated with broken flint. The ferry boats on the\r\nRhone and the Isere, are moved by the stream, and very rapidly. On\r\neach side of the river is a moveable stage, one end of which is on an\r\naxle and two wheels, which, according to the tide, can be advanced or\r\nwithdrawn, so as to apply to the gunwale of the boat. The Prætorian\r\npalace at Vienne is forty-four feet wide, of the Corinthian order, four\r\ncolumns in front, and four in flank. It was begun in the year 400, and\r\nfinished by Charlemagne. The Sepulchral pyramid, a little way out of the\r\ntown, has an order for its basement, the pedestal of which, from point\r\nto point of its cap, is twenty-four feet one inch. At each angle, is a\r\ncolumn, engaged one fourth in the wall. The circumference of the three\r\nfourths disengaged, is four feet four inches; consequently, the diameter\r\nis twenty-three inches. The base of the column indicates it to be Ionic,\r\nbut the capitals are not formed. The cornice, too, is a bastard Ionic,\r\nwithout modillions or dentils. Between the columns, on each side, is an\r\narch of eight feet four inches, opening with a pilaster on each side of\r\nit. On the top of the basement is a zocle, in the plane of the frieze\r\nbelow. On that is the pyramid, its base in the plane of the collarins of\r\nthe pilaster below. The pyramid is a little truncated on its top. This\r\nmonument is inedited.\r\n\r\nMarch 18th. _Principality of Orange._ The plains on the Rhone here are\r\ntwo or three leagues wide, reddish, good, in corn, clover, almonds,\r\nolives. No forests. Here begins the country of olives, there being very\r\nfew till we enter this principality. They are the only tree which I see\r\nplanted among vines. Thyme grows wild here on the hills. Asses, very\r\nsmall, sell here for two or three louis. The high hills in Dauphiné are\r\ncovered with snow. The remains of the Roman aqueduct are of brick: a\r\nfine piece of Mosaic, still on its bed, forming the floor of a cellar.\r\nTwenty feet of it still visible. They are taking down the circular wall\r\nof the amphitheatre to pave a road.\r\n\r\nMarch 19th to 23d. LANGUEDOC. _Pont St. Esprit._ _Bagnols._ _Connault._\r\n_Valignieres._ _Remoulins._ _St. Gervasy._ _Nismes._ _Pont d'Arles._ To\r\nRemoulins, there is a mixture of hill and dale. Thence to Nismes, hills\r\non the right, on the left, plains extending to the Rhone and the sea.\r\nThe hills are rocky. Where there is soil, it is reddish and poor. The\r\nplains, generally reddish and good, but stony. When you approach the\r\nRhone, going to Arles, the soil becomes a dark gray loam with some sand,\r\nand very good. The culture is corn, clover, St. foin, olives, vines,\r\nmulberries, willow, and some almonds. There is no forest. The hills are\r\ninclosed in dry stone wall. Many sheep.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the first hill, after leaving Pont St. Esprit, there\r\nis a beautiful view of the bridge at about two miles distance, and\r\na fine landscape of the country both ways. From thence, an excellent\r\nroad, judiciously conducted, through very romantic scenes. In one part,\r\ndescending the face of a hill, it is laid out in serpentine, and not\r\nzigzag, to ease the descent. In others, it passes through a winding\r\nmeadow, from fifty to one hundred yards, walled, as it were, on both\r\nsides, by hills of rock; and at length issues into plain country. The\r\nwaste hills are covered with thyme, box, and chene-vert. Where the\r\nbody of the mountains has a surface of soil, the summit has sometimes a\r\ncrown of rock, as observed in Champagne. At Nismes, the earth is full\r\nof lime-stone. The horses are shorn. They are now pruning the olive.\r\nA very good tree produces sixty pounds of olives, which yield fifteen\r\npounds of oil: the best quality sells at twelve sous the pound, retail,\r\nand ten sous, wholesale. The high hills of Languedoc still covered with\r\nsnow. The horse chestnut and mulberry are leafing; apple trees and peas\r\nblossoming. The first butterfly I have seen. After the vernal equinox,\r\nthey are often six or eight months without rain. Many separate farm\r\nhouses, numbers of people in rags, and abundance of beggars. The mine\r\nof wheat, weighing thirty pounds, costs four livres and ten sous. Wheat\r\nbread, three sous the pound. Vin ordinaire, good, and of a strong body,\r\ntwo or three sous the bottle. Oranges, one sous a piece. They are nearly\r\nfinishing at Nismes, a great mill, worked by a steam engine, which\r\npumps water from a lower into an upper cistern, from whence two overshot\r\nwheels are supplied, each of which turns two pair of stones. The upper\r\ncistern being once filled with water, it passes through the wheels into\r\nthe lower one, from whence it is returned to the upper by the pumps. A\r\nstream of water of one quarter or one half inch diameter, supplies the\r\nwaste of evaporation, absorption, &c. This is furnished from a well by\r\na horse. The arches of the Pont St. Esprit are of eighty-eight feet.\r\nWild figs, very flourishing, grow out of the joints of the Pont du Gard.\r\nThe fountain of Nismes is so deep, that a stone was thirteen seconds\r\ndescending from the surface to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMarch 24th. From _Nismes_ to _Arles_. The plains extending from Nismes\r\nto the Rhone, in the direction of Arles, are broken in one place by a\r\nskirt of low hills. They are red and stony at first, but as you approach\r\nthe Rhone, they are of a dark gray mould, with a little sand, and very\r\ngood. They are in corn and clover, vines, olives, almonds, mulberries,\r\nand willow. There are some sheep, no wood, no inclosures.\r\n\r\nThe high hills of Languedoc are covered with snow. At an ancient church,\r\nin the suburbs of Arles, are some hundreds of ancient stone coffins,\r\nalong the road side. The ground is thence called les champs elysées. In\r\na vault in a church, are some curiously wrought, and in a back yard are\r\nmany ancient statues, inscriptions, &c. Within the town, are a part of\r\ntwo Corinthian columns, and of the pediment with which they were crowned,\r\nvery rich, having belonged to the ancient capitol of the place. But the\r\nprincipal monument here, is an amphitheatre, the external portico of which\r\nis tolerably complete. How many porticoes there were, cannot be seen:\r\nbut at one of the principal gates, there are still five, measuring, from\r\nout to in, seventy-eight feet ten inches, the vault diminishing inwards.\r\nThere are sixty-four arches, each of which is, from centre to centre,\r\ntwenty feet six inches. Of course, the diameter is of four hundred and\r\nthirty-eight feet; or of four hundred and fifty feet, if we suppose the\r\nfour principal arches a little larger than the rest. The ground-floor\r\nis supported on innumerable vaults. The first story, externally, has\r\na tall pedestal, like a pilaster, between every two arches: the upper\r\nstory, a column, the base of which would indicate it Corinthian. Every\r\ncolumn is truncated as low as the impost of the arch, but the arches\r\nare all entire. The whole of the upper entablature is gone, and of the\r\nAttic, if there was one. Not a single seat of the internal is visible.\r\nThe whole of the inside, and nearly the whole of the outside, is masked\r\nby buildings. It is supposed there are one thousand inhabitants within\r\nthe amphitheatre. The walls are more entire and firm than those of the\r\namphitheatre at Nismes. I suspect its plan and distribution to have been\r\nvery different from that.\r\n\r\n_Terrasson._ The plains of the Rhone from Arles to this place, are\r\na league or two wide: the mould is of a dark gray, good, in corn and\r\nlucerne. Neither wood, nor inclosures. Many sheep.\r\n\r\n_St. Remis._ From Terrasson to St. Remis, is a plain of a league or two\r\nwide, bordered by broken hills of massive rock. It is gray and stony,\r\nmostly in olives. Some almonds, mulberries, willows, vines, corn, and\r\nlucerne. Many sheep. No forest, nor inclosures.\r\n\r\nA laboring man's wages here, are one hundred and fifty livres, a woman's\r\nhalf, and fed. Two hundred and eighty pounds of wheat sell for forty-two\r\nlivres. They make no butter here. It costs, when bought, fifteen sous the\r\npound. Oil is ten sous the pound. Tolerably good olive trees yield, one\r\nwith another, about twenty pounds of oil. An olive tree must be twenty\r\nyears old before it has paid its own expenses. It lasts forever. In 1765,\r\nit was so cold, that the Rhone was frozen over at Arles for two months.\r\nIn 1767, there was a cold spell of a week, which killed all the olive\r\ntrees. From being fine weather, in one hour there was ice hard enough to\r\nbear a horse. It killed people on the road. The old roots of the olive\r\ntrees put out again. Olive grounds sell for twenty-four livres a tree,\r\nand lease at twenty-four sous the tree. The trees are fifteen pieds\r\napart. But lucerne is a more profitable culture. An arpent yields one\r\nhundred quintals of hay a year, worth three livres the quintal. It is\r\ncut four or five times a year. It is sowed in the broadcast, and lasts\r\nfive or six years. An arpent of ground for corn, rents at from thirty\r\nto thirty-six livres. Their leases are for six or nine years. They plant\r\nwillow for fire-wood, and for hoops to their casks. It seldom rains here\r\nin summer. There are some chateaux, many separate farm-houses, good,\r\nand ornamented in the small way, so as to show that the tenant's whole\r\ntime is not occupied in procuring physical necessaries.\r\n\r\nMarch 25th. _Orgon._ _Pontroyal._ _St. Cannat._ From Orgon to Pontroyal,\r\nafter quitting the plains of the Rhone, the country seems still to be\r\na plain, cut into compartments by chains of mountains of massive rock,\r\nrunning through it in various directions. From Pontroyal to St. Cannat,\r\nthe land lies rather in basins. The soil is very various, gray and\r\nclay, gray and stony, red and stony; sometimes good, sometimes middling,\r\noften barren. We find some golden willows. Towards Pontroyal, the hills\r\nbegin to be in vines, and afterwards, in some pasture of green sward and\r\nclover. About Orgon are some inclosures of quick set, others of conical\r\nyews planted close. Towards St. Cannat, they begin to be of stone.\r\n\r\nThe high mountains are covered with snow. Some separate farm-houses of\r\nmud. Near Pontroyal is a canal for watering the country; one branch goes\r\nto Terrasson, the other to Arles.\r\n\r\nMarch 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th. _Aix._ The country is waving in vines,\r\npasture of green sward and clover, much inclosed with stone, and abounding\r\nwith sheep.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Aix, the valley which opens from thence towards the\r\nmouth of the Rhone and the sea, is rich and beautiful; a perfect grove\r\nof olive trees, mixed among which, are corn, lucerne, and vines. The\r\nwaste grounds throw out thyme and lavender. Wheat bread is three sous\r\nthe pound. Cow's milk sixteen sous the quart, sheep's milk six sous,\r\nbutter of sheep's milk twenty sous the pound. Oil, of the best quality,\r\nis twelve sous the pound, and sixteen sous if it be virgin oil. This\r\nis what runs from the olive when put into the press, spontaneously;\r\nafterwards they are forced by the press and by hot water. Dung costs ten\r\nsous the one hundred pounds. Their fire-wood is chene-vert and willow.\r\nThe latter is lopped every three years. An ass sells for from one to\r\nthree louis; the best mules for thirty louis. The best asses will carry\r\ntwo hundred pounds; the best horses three hundred pounds; the best mules\r\nsix hundred pounds. The temperature of the mineral waters of Aix, is\r\n90° of Farenheit's thermometer, at the spout. A mule eats half as much\r\nas a horse. The allowance to an ass for the day, is a handful of bran\r\nmixed with straw. The price of mutton and beef, about six and a half\r\nsous the pound. The beef comes from Auvergne, and is poor and bad. The\r\nmutton is small, but of excellent flavor. The wages of a laboring man\r\nare one hundred and fifty livres the year, a woman's sixty to sixty-six\r\nlivres, and fed. Their bread is half wheat, half rye, made once in three\r\nor four weeks, to prevent too great a consumption. In the morning, they\r\neat bread with an anchovy, or an onion. Their dinner in the middle of\r\nthe day, is bread, soup, and vegetables. Their supper the same. With\r\ntheir vegetables, they have always oil and vinegar. The oil costs about\r\neight sous the pound. They drink what is called piquette. This is made\r\nafter the grapes are pressed, by pouring hot water on the pumice. On\r\nSunday they have meat and wine. Their wood for building comes mostly\r\nfrom the Alps, down the Durance and Rhone. A stick of pine, fifty feet\r\nlong, girting sixty feet and three inches at one end, and three feet\r\nthree inches at the other, costs, delivered here, from fifty-four to\r\nsixty livres. Sixty pounds of wheat cost seven livres. One of their\r\nlittle asses will travel with his burthen about five or six leagues a\r\nday, and day by day; a mule from six to eight leagues.[19]\r\n\r\nMarch 29. _Marseilles._ The country is hilly, intersected by chains of\r\nhills and mountains of massive rock. The soil is reddish, stony, and\r\nindifferent where best. Wherever there is any soil, it is covered with\r\nolives. Among these are corn, vines, some lucerne, mulberry, some almonds\r\nand willow. Neither inclosures, nor forest. A very few sheep.\r\n\r\nOn the road I saw one of those little whirlwinds which we have in\r\nVirginia, also some gullied hill sides. The people are in separate\r\nestablishments. Ten morning observations of the thermometer, from the\r\n20th to the 31st of March inclusive, made at Nismes, St. Renny, Aix\r\nand Marseilles, give me an average of 52 1-2° and 46° and 61°, for the\r\ngreatest and least morning heats. Nine afternoon observations, yield an\r\naverage of 62 2-3° and 57° and 66°, the greatest and least. The longest\r\nday here, from sunrise to sunset, is fifteen hours and fourteen minutes;\r\nthe shortest is eight hours and forty-six minutes; the latitude being\r\n----. There are no tides in the Mediterranean. It is observed to me,\r\nthat the olive tree grows no where more than thirty leagues distant\r\nfrom that sea. I suppose, however, that both Spain and Portugal furnish\r\nproofs to the contrary, and doubt its truth as to Asia, Africa, and\r\nAmerica. They are six or eight months at a time, here, without rain.\r\nThe most delicate figs known in Europe, are those growing about this\r\nplace, called figues Marcelloises, or les veritables Marcelloises, to\r\ndistinguish them from others of inferior quality growing here. These\r\nkeep any length of time. All others exude a sugar in the spring of the\r\nyear, and become sour. The only process for preserving them, is drying\r\nthem in the sun, without putting any thing to them whatever. They sell\r\nat fifteen sous the pound, while there are others as cheap as five sous\r\nthe pound. I meet here a small dried grape from Smyrna without a seed.\r\nThere are few of the plants growing in this neighborhood. The best grape\r\nfor drying known here, is called des Panses. They are very large, with\r\na thick skin and much juice. They are best against a wall of southern\r\naspect, as their abundance of juice requires a great deal of sun to\r\ndry it. Pretty good fig trees are about the size of the apricot tree,\r\nand yield about twenty pounds of figs when dry, each. But the largest\r\nwill yield the value of a louis. They are sometimes fifteen inches in\r\ndiameter. It is said the Marseilles fig degenerates when transported\r\ninto any other part of the country. The leaves of the mulberry tree will\r\nsell for about three livres, the purchaser gathering them. The caper is\r\na creeping plant. It is killed to the roots every winter. In the spring\r\nit puts out branches, which creep to the distance of three feet from the\r\ncentre. The fruit forms on the stem, as that extends itself, and must be\r\ngathered every day as it forms. This is the work of women. The pistache\r\ngrows in this neighborhood also, but not very good. They eat them in\r\ntheir milky state. Monsieur de Bergasse has a wine cellar two hundred\r\nand forty pieds long, in which are one hundred and twenty tons, of from\r\nfifty to one hundred pieces each. These tons are twelve pieds diameter;\r\nthe staves four inches thick, the heading two and a half pouces thick.\r\nThe temperature of his cellar is of 9 1-2 of Reaumur. The best method\r\nof packing wine, when bottled, is to lay the bottles on their side, and\r\ncover them with sand. The 2nd of April, the young figs are formed; the\r\n4th we have Windsor beans. They have had asparagus ever since the middle\r\nof March. The 5th, I see strawberries and the Guelder rose in blossom.\r\nTo preserve the raisin, it is first dipped into ley and then dried in\r\nthe sun. The aloe grows in the open ground. I measured a mule, not the\r\nlargest, five feet and two inches high. Marseilles is in an amphitheatre,\r\nat the mouth of the Vaune, surrounded by high mountains of naked rock,\r\ndistant two or three leagues. The country within that amphitheatre is\r\na mixture of small hills, vallies and plains. The latter are naturally\r\nrich. The hills and vallies are forced into production. Looking from\r\nthe Château de Notre dame de la garde, it would seem as if there was\r\na Bastide for every arpent. The plain land sells for one hundred louis\r\nthe caterelle, which is less than an acre. The ground of the arsenal in\r\nMarseilles, sold for from fifteen to forty louis the square verge, being\r\nnearly the square yard English. In the fields open to the sea, they are\r\nobliged to plant rows of canes, every here and there, to break the force\r\nof the wind. Saw at the Château Borelli, pumps worked by the wind.\r\n\r\nApril 6. From _Marseilles_ to _Aubagne_. A valley on the Vaune, bordered\r\non each side by high mountains of massive rock, on which are only some\r\nsmall pines. The interjacent valley is of small hills, vallies and\r\nplains, reddish, gravelly, and originally poor, but fertilized by art,\r\nand covered with corn, vines, olives, figs, almonds, mulberries, lucerne\r\nand clover. The river is twelve or fifteen feet wide, one or two feet\r\ndeep and rapid.\r\n\r\nFrom _Aubagne_ to _Cuges_, _Beausset_, _Toulon_. The road quitting\r\nthe Vaune and its wealthy valley, a little after Aubagne, enters those\r\nmountains of rock, and is engaged with them about a dozen miles. Then\r\nit passes six or eight miles through a country still very hilly and\r\nstony, but laid up in terraces, covered with olives, vines and corn. It\r\nthen follows for two or three miles, a hollow between two of those high\r\nmountains, which has been found or made by a small stream. The mountains\r\nthen, reclining a little from their perpendicular, and presenting a coat\r\nof soil, reddish and tolerably good, have given place to the little\r\nvillage of Olioules, in the gardens of which are oranges in the open\r\nground. It continues hilly till we enter the plain of Toulon. On different\r\nparts of this road there are figs in the open fields. At Cuges, is a\r\nplain of about three-fourths of a mile in diameter, surrounded by high\r\nmountains of rock. In this, the caper is principally cultivated. The soil\r\nis mulatto, gravelly, and of middling quality, or rather indifferent.\r\nThe plants are set in quincunx, about eight feet apart. They have been\r\ncovered during winter by a hill of earth a foot high. They are now\r\ninclosing, pruning and ploughing them.\r\n\r\n_Toulon._ From Olioules to Toulon, the figs are in the open fields. Some\r\nof them have stems of fifteen inches diameter. They generally fork near\r\nthe ground, but sometimes have a single stem of five feet long. They\r\nare as large as apricot trees. The olive trees of this day's journey\r\nare about the size of large apple trees. The people are in separate\r\nestablishments. Toulon is in a valley at the mouth of the Goutier, a\r\nlittle river of the size of the Vaune; surrounded by high mountains of\r\nnaked rock, leaving some space between them and the sea. This space is\r\nhilly, reddish, gravelly, and of middling quality, in olives, vines,\r\ncorn, almonds, figs and capers. The capers are planted eight feet apart.\r\nA bush yields, one year with another, two pounds, worth twelve sous the\r\npound. Every plant then, yields twenty-four sous, equal to one shilling\r\nsterling. An acre containing six hundred and seventy-six plants, would\r\nyield thirty-three pounds sixteen shillings sterling. The fruit is\r\ngathered by women, who can gather about twelve pounds a day. They begin\r\nto gather about the last of June, and end about the middle of October.\r\nEach plant must be picked every day. These plants grow equally well in\r\nthe best or worst soil, or even in the walls where there is no soil.\r\nThey will last the life of a man or longer. The heat is so great at\r\nToulon in summer, as to occasion very great cracks in the earth. Where\r\nthe caper is in a soil that will admit it, they plough it. They have\r\npeas here through the winter, sheltering them occasionally; and they\r\nhave had them ever since the 25th of March without shelter.\r\n\r\nApril 6. _Hieres._ This is a plain of two or three miles diameter, bounded\r\nby the sea on one side, and mountains of rock on the other. The soil\r\nis reddish, gravelly, tolerably good and well watered. It is in olives,\r\nmulberries, vines, figs, corn, and some flax. There are also some cherry\r\ntrees. From Hieres to the sea, which is two or three miles, is a grove\r\nof orange trees, olives, and mulberries. The largest orange tree is of\r\ntwo feet diameter one way, and one foot the other, (for the section of\r\nall the larger ones would be an oval, not a round,) and about twenty\r\nfeet high. Such a tree will yield about six thousand oranges a year.\r\nThe garden of M. Fille, has fifteen thousand six hundred orange trees.\r\nSome years they yield forty thousand livres, some only ten thousand;\r\nbut generally about twenty-five thousand. The trees are from eight to\r\nten feet apart. They are blossoming and bearing all the year, flowers\r\nand fruit in every stage, at the same time. But the best fruit is that\r\nwhich is gathered in April and May. Hieres is a village of about five\r\nthousand inhabitants, at the foot of a mountain which covers it from\r\nthe north, and from which extends a plain of two or three miles to the\r\nsea shore. It has no port. Here are palm trees twenty or thirty feet\r\nhigh, but they bear no fruit. There is also a botanical garden kept by\r\nthe King. Considerable salt ponds here. Hieres is six miles from the\r\npublic road. It is built on a narrow spur of the mountain. The streets\r\nin every direction are steep, in steps of stairs, and about eight feet\r\nwide. No carriage of any kind can enter it. The wealthiest inhabitants\r\nuse _chaises a porteurs_. But there are few wealthy, the bulk of the\r\ninhabitants being laborers of the earth. At a league's distance in the\r\nsea, is an island on which is the Château de Geans, belonging to the\r\nMarquis de Pontoives; there is a cause-way leading to it. The cold of the\r\nlast November killed the leaves of a great number of the orange trees,\r\nand some of the trees themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom Hieres to _Cuers_, _Pignans_, _Luc_, is mostly a plain, with\r\nmountains on each hand, at a mile or two distance. The soil is generally\r\nreddish, and the latter part very red and good. The growth is, olives,\r\nfigs, vines, mulberries, corn, clover, and lucerne. The olive trees are\r\nfrom three to four feet in diameter. There are hedges of pomegranates,\r\nsweetbriar, and broom. A great deal of thyme growing wild. There are\r\nsome inclosures of stone; some sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nApril 9th. From Luc to _Vidauban_, _Muy_, _Frejus_, the road leads\r\nthrough vallies, and crosses occasionally the mountains which separate\r\nthem. The vallies are tolerably good, always red and stony, gravelly or\r\ngritty. Their produce as before. The mountains are barren.\r\n\r\n_Lesterelle_, _Napoule_. Eighteen miles of ascent and descent, of a very\r\nhigh mountain. Its growth, where capable of any, two-leaved pine, very\r\nsmall, and some chene vert.\r\n\r\n_Antibes_, _Nice_. From Napoule, the road is generally near the sea,\r\npassing over little hills or strings of vallies, the soil stony, and\r\nmuch below mediocrity in its quality. Here and there, is a good plain.\r\n\r\nThere is snow on the high mountains. The first frogs I have heard, are\r\nof this day (the 9th.) At Antibes are oranges in the open ground, but\r\nin small inclosures; palm trees also. From thence to the Var, are the\r\nlargest fig trees and olive trees I have seen. The fig trees are eighteen\r\ninches in diameter, and six feet, stem; the olives, sometimes six feet\r\nin diameter, and as large heads as the largest low ground apple trees.\r\nThis tree was but a shrub where I first fell in with it, and has become\r\nlarger and larger to this place. The people are mostly in villages. The\r\nseveral provinces, and even cantons are distinguished by the form of the\r\nwomen's hats, so that one may know of what canton a woman is, by her hat.\r\n\r\n_Nice._ The pine bur is used here for kindling fires. The people are in\r\nseparate establishments. With respect to the orange, there seems to be no\r\nclimate on this side of the Alps, sufficiently mild in itself to preserve\r\nit without shelter. At Olioules, they are between two high mountains;\r\nat Hieres, covered on the north by a very high mountain; at Antibes and\r\nNice, covered by mountains, and also within small high enclosures. Quære.\r\nTo trace the true line from east to west, which forms the northern and\r\nnatural limit of that fruit? Saw an elder tree (sambucus) near Nice,\r\nfifteen inches in diameter, and eight feet stem. The wine made in this\r\nneighborhood is good, though not of the first quality. There are one\r\nthousand mules, loaded with merchandise, which pass every week between\r\nNice and Turin, counting those coming as well as going.\r\n\r\nApril 13th. _Scarena._ _Sospello._ There are no orange trees after we\r\nleave the environs of Nice. We lose the olive after rising a little\r\nabove the village of Scarena, on Mount Braus, and find it again on the\r\nother side, a little before we get down to Sospello. But wherever there\r\nis soil enough, it is terraced, and in corn. The waste parts are either\r\nin two-leaved pine and thyme, or of absolutely naked rock. Sospello is\r\non a little torrent, called Bevera, which runs into the river Roia, at\r\nthe mouth of which is Ventimiglia. The olive trees on the mountain, are\r\nnow loaded with fruit; while some at Sospello are in blossom. Firewood\r\nhere and at Scarena, costs fifteen sous the quintal.\r\n\r\nApril 14th. _Ciandola._ _Tende._ In crossing Mount Brois, we lose the\r\nolive tree after getting to a certain height, and find it again on the\r\nother side at the village of Breglio. Here we come to the river Roia,\r\nwhich, after receiving the branch on which is Sospello, leads to the\r\nsea at Ventimiglia. The Roia is about twelve yards wide, and abounds\r\nwith speckled trout. Were a road made from Breglio, along the side of\r\nthe Roia, to Ventimiglia, it might turn the commerce of Turin to this\r\nlast place instead of Nice; because it would avoid the mountains of\r\nBraus and Brois, leaving only that of Tende; that is to say, it would\r\navoid more than half the difficulties of the passage. Further on, we\r\ncome to the Château di Saorgio, where a scene is presented, the most\r\nsingular and picturesque I ever saw. The castle and village seem hanging\r\nto a cloud in front. On the right, is a mountain cloven through, to\r\nlet pass a gurgling stream; on the left, a river, over which is thrown\r\na magnificent bridge. The whole forms a basin, the sides of which are\r\nshagged with rocks, olive trees, vines, herds, &c. Near here, I saw a\r\ntub wheel without a ream; the trunk descended from the top of the water\r\nfall to the wheel, in a direct line, but with the usual inclination.\r\nThe produce along this passage, is most generally olives, except on\r\nthe heights as before observed; also corn, vines, mulberries, figs,\r\ncherries, and walnuts. They have cows, goats, and sheep. In passing on\r\ntowards Tende, olives fail us ultimately at the village of Fontan, and\r\nthere the chesnut trees begin in good quantity. Ciandola consists of\r\nonly two houses, both taverns. Tende is a very inconsiderable village,\r\nin which they have not yet the luxury of glass windows; nor in any of\r\nthe villages on this passage, have they yet the fashion of powdering the\r\nhair. Common stone and limestone are so abundant, that the apartments\r\nof every story are vaulted with stone, to save wood.\r\n\r\nApril 15th. _Limone._ _Coni._ I see abundance of limestone as far as the\r\nearth is uncovered with snow; _i. e._ within half or three-quarters of\r\nan hour's walk of the top. The snows descend much lower on the eastern\r\nthan the western side. Wherever there is soil, there is corn quite to\r\nthe commencement of the snows, and I suppose under them also. The waste\r\nparts are in two-leaved pine, lavender and thyme. From the foot of the\r\nmountain to Coni, the road follows a branch of the Po, the plains of which\r\nbegin narrow, and widen at length into a general plain country, bounded\r\non one side by the Alps. They are good, dark colored, sometimes tinged\r\nwith red, and in pasture, corn, mulberries, and some almonds. The hill\r\nsides bordering these plains, are reddish, and where they admit of it,\r\nare in corn, but this is seldom. They are mostly in chesnut, and often\r\nabsolutely barren. The whole of the plains are plentifully watered from\r\nthe river, as is much of the hill side. A great deal of golden willow\r\nall along the rivers, on the whole of this passage through the Alps.\r\nThe southern parts of France, but still more the passage through the\r\nAlps, enable one to form a scale of the tenderer plants, arranging them\r\naccording to their several powers of resisting cold. Ascending three\r\ndifferent mountains, Braus, Brois, and Tende, they disappear one after\r\nanother; and descending on the other side, they show themselves again one\r\nafter another. This is their order, from the tenderest to the hardiest.\r\nCaper, orange, palm, aloe, olive, pomegranate, walnut, fig, almond. But\r\nthis must be understood of the plant; for as to the fruit, the order\r\nis somewhat different. The caper, for example, is the tenderest plant,\r\nyet being so easily protected, it is the most certain in its fruit. The\r\nalmond, the hardiest plant, loses its fruit the oftenest, on account of\r\nits forwardness. The palm, hardier than the caper and the orange, never\r\nproduces perfect fruit in these parts. Coni is a considerable town, and\r\npretty well built. It is walled.\r\n\r\nApril 16th. _Centale._ _Savigliano._ _Racconigi._ _Poerino._ _Turin._\r\nThe Alps, as far as they are in view from north to south, show the\r\ngradation of climate, by the line which terminates the snows lying on\r\nthem. This line begins at their foot northwardly, and rises, as they\r\npass on to the south, so as to be half way up their sides on the most\r\nsouthern undulations of the mountain, now in view. From the mountains\r\nto Turin, we see no tree tenderer than the walnut. Of these, as well\r\nas of almonds and mulberries, there are a few; somewhat more of vines,\r\nbut most generally, willows and poplars. Corn is sowed with all these.\r\nThey mix with them also clover and small grass. The country is a general\r\nplain; the soil dark, and sometimes, though rarely, reddish. It is rich,\r\nand much infested with wild onions. At Racconigi, I see the tops and\r\nshocks of maize, which prove it is cultivated here; but it can be in\r\nsmall quantities only, because I observe very little ground, but what\r\nhas already something else in it. Here and there, are small patches\r\nprepared, I suppose, for maize. They have a method of planting the vine,\r\nwhich I have not seen before. At intervals of about eight feet, they\r\nplant from two to six plants of vine in a cluster. At each cluster they\r\nfix a forked staff, the plane of the prongs of the fork at a right angle\r\nwith the row of vines. Athwart these prongs they lash another staff,\r\nlike a handspike, about eight feet long, horizontally, seven or eight\r\nfeet from the ground. Of course, it crosses the rows at right angles.\r\nThe vines are brought from the foot of the fork up to this cross piece,\r\nturned over it, and conducted along over the next, the next, and so\r\non, as far as they will extend, the whole forming an arbor eight feet\r\nwide and high, and of the whole length of the row, little interrupted\r\nby the stems of the vines, which being close around the fork, pass up\r\nthrough hoops, so as to occupy a space only of smaller diameter. All the\r\nbuildings in this country are of brick, sometimes covered with plaster,\r\nsometimes not. There is a very large and handsome bridge of seven arches,\r\nover the torrent of Sangone. We cross the Po, in swinging batteaux. Two\r\nare placed side by side, and kept together by a plank floor, common to\r\nboth, and lying on the gunwales. The carriage drives on this, without\r\ntaking out any of the horses. About one hundred and fifty yards up the\r\nriver, is a fixed stake, and a rope tied to it, the other end of which\r\nis made fast to one side of the batteaux, so as to throw them oblique to\r\nthe current. The stream then acting on them, as on an inclined plane,\r\nforces them cross the current in the portion of a circle of which the\r\nrope is the radius. To support the rope in its whole length, there are\r\ntwo intermediate canoes, about fifty yards apart, in the heads of which\r\nare short masts. To the top of these, the rope is lashed, the canoes\r\nbeing free otherwise to concur with the general vibration, in their\r\nsmaller arcs of circles. The Po is there, about fifty yards wide, and\r\nabout one hundred in the neighborhood of Turin.\r\n\r\nApril 17th, 18th. _Turin._ The first nightingale I have heard this year,\r\nis to-day (18th.) There is a red wine of Nebiule made in the neighborhood,\r\nwhich is very singular. It is about as sweet as the silky Madeira, as\r\nastringent on the palate as Bourdeaux, and as brisk as Champagne. It\r\nis a pleasing wine. At Moncaglieri, about six miles from Turin, on the\r\nright side of the Po, begins a ridge of mountains, which, following the\r\nPo by Turin, after some distance, spreads wide, and forms the duchy of\r\nMontferrat. The soil is mostly red, and in vines, affording a wine called\r\nMontferrat, which is thick and strong.\r\n\r\nApril 19th. _Settimo._ _Chivasco._ _Ciliano._ _S. Germano._ _Vercelli._\r\nThe country continues plain and rich, the soil black. The culture, corn,\r\npasture, maize, vines, mulberries, walnuts, some willow and poplar. The\r\nmaize bears a very small proportion to the small grain. The earth is\r\nformed into ridges from three to four feet wide, and the maize sowed in\r\nthe broad cast on the higher parts of the ridge, so as to cover a third\r\nor half of the whole surface. It is sowed late in May. This country is\r\nplentifully and beautifully watered at present. Much of it is by torrents\r\nwhich are dry in summer. These torrents make a great deal of waste ground,\r\ncovering it with sand and stones. These wastes are sometimes planted\r\nin trees, sometimes quite unemployed. They make hedges of willows, by\r\nsetting the plants from one to three feet apart. When they are grown\r\nto the height of eight or ten feet, they bend them down, and interlace\r\nthem one with another. I do not see any of these, however, which are\r\nbecome old. Probably, therefore, they soon die. The women here smite on\r\nthe anvil, and work with the maul and spade. The people of this country\r\nare ill dressed in comparison with those of France, and there are more\r\nspots of uncultivated ground. The plough here is made with a single\r\nhandle, which is a beam twelve feet long, six inches in diameter below,\r\nand tapered to about two inches at the upper end. They use goads for\r\nthe oxen, not whips. The first swallows I have seen, are to-day. There\r\nis a wine called Gatina, made in the neighborhood of Vercelli, both red\r\nand white. The latter resembles Calcavallo. There is also a red wine\r\nof Salusola which is esteemed. It is very light. In the neighborhood of\r\nVercelli begin the rice fields. The water with which they are watered is\r\nvery dear. They do not permit rice to be sown within two miles of the\r\ncities on account of the insalubrity. Notwithstanding this, when the\r\nwater is drawn off the fields in August, the whole country is subject\r\nto agues and fevers. They estimate that the same measure of ground\r\nyields three times as much rice as wheat, and with half the labor. They\r\nare now sowing. As soon as sowed, they let on the water, two or three\r\ninches deep. After six weeks, or two months, they draw it off to weed;\r\nthen let it on again, and it remains till August, when it is drawn off,\r\nabout three or four weeks before the grain is ripe. In September they\r\ncut it. It is first threshed, then beaten in the mortar to separate the\r\nhusk, then by different siftings it is separated into three qualities.\r\nTwelve rupes, equal to three hundred pounds of twelve ounces each, sell\r\nfor sixteen livres, money of Piedmont, where the livre is exactly the\r\nshilling of England. Twelve rupes of maize sell for nine livres. The\r\nmachine for separating the husk is thus made. In the axis of a water\r\nwheel are a number of arms inserted, which, as they revolve, catches\r\neach the cog of a pestle, lifts it to a certain height, and lets it\r\nfall again. These pestles are five and a quarter inches square, ten\r\nfeet long, and at their lower end formed into a truncated cone of three\r\ninches diameter, where cut off. The conical part is covered with iron.\r\nThe pestles are ten and a half inches apart in the clear. They pass\r\nthrough two horizontal beams, which string them, as it were, together,\r\nand while the mortises in the beams are so loose, as to let the pestles\r\nwork vertically, it restrains them to that motion. There is a mortar of\r\nwood, twelve or fifteen inches deep, under each pestle, covered with a\r\nboard, the hole of which is only large enough to let the pestle pass\r\nfreely. There are two arms in the axis for every pestle, so that the\r\npestle gives two strokes for every revolution of the wheel. Poggio, a\r\nmuleteer, who passes every week between Vercelli and Genoa, will smuggle\r\na sack of rough rice for me to Genoa; it being death to export it in that\r\nform. They have good cattle, and in good number, mostly cream-colored;\r\nand some middle-sized sheep. The streams furnish speckled trout.\r\n\r\nApril 20th. _Novara._ _Buffalora._ _Sedriano._ _Milan._ From Vercelli to\r\nNovara the fields are all in rice, and now mostly under water. The dams\r\nseparating the several water-plats, or ponds, are set in willow. At Novara\r\nthere are some figs in the gardens, in situations well protected. From\r\nNovara to the Ticino, it is mostly stony and waste, grown up in broom.\r\nFrom Ticino to Milan, it is all in corn. Among the corn are willows,\r\nprincipally a good many mulberries, some walnuts, and here and there\r\nan almond. The country still a plain, the soil black and rich, except\r\nbetween Novara and the Ticino, as before mentioned. There is very fine\r\npasture round Vercelli and Novara to the distance of two miles, within\r\nwhich rice is not permitted. We cross the Sisto on the same kind of\r\nvibrating or pendulum boat as on the Po. The river is eighty or ninety\r\nyards wide; the rope fastened to an island two hundred yards above, and\r\nsupported by five intermediate canoes. It is about one and a half inches\r\nin diameter. On these rivers they use a short oar of twelve feet long,\r\nthe flat end of which is hooped with iron, shooting out a prong at each\r\ncorner, so that it may be used occasionally as a setting pole. There is\r\nsnow on the Appenines, near Genoa. They have still another method here\r\nof planting the vine. Along rows of trees, they lash poles from tree to\r\ntree. Between the trees are set vines, which, passing over the pole,\r\nare carried on to the pole of the next tree, whose vines are in like\r\nmanner brought to this, and twined together, thus forming the intervals\r\nbetween the rows of trees alternately into arbors and open space. They\r\nhave another method also of making quick set hedges. Willows are planted\r\nfrom one to two feet apart, and interlaced, so that every one is crossed\r\nby three or four others.\r\n\r\nApril 21st, 22d. _Milan._ Figs and pomegranates grow here unsheltered,\r\nas I am told. I saw none, and therefore suppose them rare. They had\r\nformerly olives; but a great cold in 1709 killed them, and they have not\r\nbeen replanted. Among a great many houses painted _al fresco_, the Casa\r\nRoma and Casa Candiani, by Appiani, and Casa Belgioiosa, by Martin, are\r\nsuperior. In the second is a small cabinet, the ceiling of which is in\r\nsmall hexagons, within which are Cameos and heads painted alternately, no\r\ntwo the same. The salon of the Casa Belgioiosa is superior to anything I\r\nhave ever seen. The mixture called Scaiola, of which they make their walls\r\nand floors, is so like the finest marble as to be scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom it. The nights of the 20th and 21st instant the rice ponds froze\r\nhalf an inch thick. Drouths of two or three months are not uncommon here\r\nin summer. About five years ago, there was such a hail as to kill cats.\r\nThe Count del Verme tells me of a pendulum odometer for the wheel of a\r\ncarriage. Leases here are mostly for nine years. Wheat costs a louis\r\nd'or the one hundred and forty pounds. A laboring man receives sixty\r\nlivres, and is fed and lodged. The trade of this country is principally\r\nrice, raw silk, and cheese.\r\n\r\nApril 23d. _Casino_, five miles from Milan. I examined another\r\nrice-beater of six pestles. They are eight feet nine inches long. Their\r\nends, instead of being a truncated cone, have nine teeth of iron, bound\r\nclosely together. Each tooth is a double pyramid, joined at the base.\r\nWhen put together, they stand with the upper ends placed in contact,\r\nso as to form them into one great cone, and the lower ends diverging.\r\nThe upper are socketed into the end of the pestle, and the lower, when\r\na little blunted by use, are not unlike the jaw teeth of the mammoth,\r\nwith their studs. They say here, that pestles armed with these teeth,\r\nclean the rice faster, and break it less. The mortar, too, is of stone,\r\nwhich is supposed as good as wood, and more durable. One half of these\r\npestles are always up. They rise about twenty-one inches, and each makes\r\nthirty-eight strokes in a minute; one hundred pounds of rough rice is\r\nput into the six mortars, and beaten somewhat less than a quarter of\r\nan hour. It is then taken out, put into a sifter of four feet diameter,\r\nsuspended horizontally; sifted there; shifted into another of the same\r\nsize; sifted there; returned to the mortars; beaten little more than a\r\nquarter of an hour; sifted again; and it is finished. The six pestles\r\nwill clear four thousand pounds in twenty-four hours. The pound here\r\nis twenty-eight ounces; the ounce equal to that of Paris. The best rice\r\nrequires half an hour's boiling; a more indifferent kind, somewhat less.\r\nTo sow the rice, they first plough the ground, then level it with a\r\ndrag harrow, and let on the water; when the earth has become soft, they\r\nsmooth it with a shovel under the water, and then sow the rice in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Rozzano._ Parmesan cheese. It is supposed this was formerly made at\r\nParma, and took its name thence, but none is made there now. It is made\r\nthrough all the country extending from Milan for one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. The most is made about Lodi. The making of butter being connected\r\nwith that of making cheese, both must be described together. There are,\r\nin the stables I saw, eighty-five cows, fed on hay and grass, not on\r\ngrain. They are milked twice in twenty-four hours, ten cows yielding at\r\nthe two milkings a _brenta_ of milk, which is twenty-four of our gallons.\r\nThe night's milk is scummed in the morning at daybreak, when the cows are\r\nmilked again, and the new milk mixed with the old. In three hours, the\r\nwhole mass is scummed a second time, the milk remaining in a kettle for\r\ncheese, and the cream being put into a cylindrical churn, shaped like\r\na grind-stone, eighteen inches radius, and fourteen inches thick. In\r\nthis churn, there are three staves pointing inwardly, endwise, to break\r\nthe current of the milk. Through its centre passes an iron axis, with\r\na handle at each end. It is turned about an hour and a half by two men\r\ntill the butter is produced. Then they pour off the buttermilk, and put\r\nin some water which they agitate backwards and forwards about a minute,\r\nand pour it off. They take out the butter, press it with their hands into\r\nloaves, and stamp it. It has no other washing. Sixteen American gallons\r\nof milk yield fifteen pounds of butter, which sell at twenty-four sous\r\nthe pound.\r\n\r\nThe milk, which, after being scummed as before, had been put into a\r\ncopper kettle, receives its due quantity of rennet, and is gently warmed,\r\nif the season requires it. In about four hours it becomes a slip. Then\r\nthe whey begins to separate. A little of it is taken out. The curd is\r\nthen thoroughly broken by a machine like a chocolate mill. A quarter of\r\nan ounce of saffron is put to seven brenta of milk, to give color to\r\nthe cheese. The kettle is then moved over the hearth, and heated by a\r\nquick fire till the curd is hard enough, being broken into small lumps\r\nby continued stirring. It is moved off the fire, most of the whey taken\r\nout, the curd compressed into a globe by the hand, a linen cloth slipped\r\nunder it, and it is drawn out in that. A loose hoop is then laid on a\r\nbench, and the curd, as wrapped in the linen, is put into the hoop; it\r\nis a little pressed by the hand, the hoop drawn tight and made fast.\r\nA board two inches thick is laid on it, and a stone on that of about\r\ntwenty pounds weight. In an hour, the whey is run off, and the cheese\r\nfinished. They sprinkle a little salt on it every other day in summer,\r\nand every day in winter, for six weeks. Seven brentas of milk make a\r\ncheese of fifty pounds, which requires six months to ripen, and is then\r\ndried to forty-five pounds. It sells on the spot for eighty-eight livres\r\nthe one hundred pounds. There are now one hundred and fifty cheeses in\r\nthis dairy. They are nineteen inches diameter, and six inches thick.\r\nThey make a cheese a day in summer, and two in three days, or one in\r\ntwo days, in winter.\r\n\r\nThe whey is put back into the kettle, the butter-milk poured into it,\r\nand of this, they make a poor cheese for the country people. The whey\r\nof this is given to the hogs. Eight men suffice to keep the cows and to\r\ndo all the business of this dairy. Mascarponi, a kind of curd, is made\r\nby pouring some butter-milk into cream, which is thereby curdled, and\r\nis then pressed into a linen cloth.\r\n\r\nThe ice-houses at Rozzano are dug about fifteen feet deep, and twenty\r\nfeet diameter, and poles are driven down all round. A conical thatched\r\nroof is then put over them, fifteen feet high, and pieces of wood are\r\nlaid at the bottom, to keep the ice out of the water which drips from it,\r\nand goes off by a sink. Straw is laid on this wood, and then the house\r\nfilled with ice, always putting straw between the ice and the walls, and\r\ncovering ultimately with straw. About a third is lost by melting. Snow\r\ngives the most delicate flavor to creams; but ice is the most powerful\r\ncongealer, and lasts longest. A tuft of trees surrounds these ice-houses.\r\n\r\nRound Milan, to the distance of five miles, are corn, pasture, gardens,\r\nmulberries, willows, and vines. For in this State, rice ponds are not\r\npermitted within five miles of the cities.\r\n\r\n_Binasco._ _Pavia._ Near Cassino the rice ponds begin, and continue to\r\nwithin five miles of Pavia, the whole ground being in rice, pasture, and\r\nwillows. The pasture is in the rice grounds which are resting. In the\r\nneighborhood of Pavia, again, are corn, pasture, &c., as round Milan.\r\nThey gave me green peas at Pavia.\r\n\r\nApril 24th. _Voghera._ _Tortona._ _Novi._ From Pavia to Novi, corn,\r\npasture, vines, mulberries, willows; but no rice. The country continues\r\nplain, except that the Appenines are approaching on the left. The soil,\r\nalways good, is dark till we approach Novi, and then red. We cross the\r\nPo where it is three hundred yards wide, in a pendulum boat. The rope\r\nis fastened on one side of the river, three hundred yards above, and\r\nsupported by eight intermediate canoes, with little masts in them to\r\ngive a greater elevation to the rope. We pass in eleven minutes. Women,\r\ngirls, and boys are working with the hoe, and breaking the clods with\r\nmauls.\r\n\r\nApril 25th. _Voltaggio._ _Campo-Marone._ _Genoa._ At Novi, the Appenines\r\nbegin to rise. Their growth of timber is oak, tall, small and knotty, and\r\nchesnut. We soon lose the walnut, ascending, and find it again, about\r\none-fourth of the way down, on the south side. About half way down,\r\nwe find figs and vines, which continue fine and in great abundance.\r\nThe Appenines are mostly covered with soil, and are in corn, pasture,\r\nmulberries, and figs, in the parts before indicated. About half way\r\nfrom their foot to Genoa, at Campo-Marone, we find again the olive tree.\r\nHence the produce becomes mixed, of all the kinds before mentioned. The\r\nmethod of sowing the Indian corn at Campo-Marone, is as follows: With\r\na hoe shaped like the blade of a trowel, two feet long, and six inches\r\nbroad at its upper end; pointed below, and a little curved, they make\r\na trench. In that, they drop the grains six inches apart. Then two feet\r\nfrom that, they make another trench, throwing the earth they take out of\r\nthat on the grain of the last one, with a singular slight and quickness;\r\nand so through the whole piece. The last trench is filled with the earth\r\nadjoining.\r\n\r\nApril 26th. _Genoa._ Strawberries at Genoa. Scaffold poles for the upper\r\nparts of a wall, as for the third story, rest on the window sills of the\r\nstory below. Slate is used here for paving, for steps, for stairs, (the\r\nrise as well as tread) and for fixed Venetian blinds. At the Palazzo\r\nMarcello Durazzo, benches with straight legs, and bottoms of cane. At\r\nthe Palazzo del principe Lomellino, at Sestri, a phaeton with a canopy.\r\nAt the former, tables folding into one plane. At Nervi they have peas,\r\nstrawberries, &c., all the year round. The gardens of the Count Durazzo\r\nat Nervi, exhibit as rich a mixture of the _utile dulci_, as I ever saw.\r\nAll the environs in Genoa, are in olives, figs, oranges, mulberries,\r\ncorn, and garden stuff. Aloes in many places, but they never flower.\r\n\r\nApril 28th. _Noli._ The Apennine and Alps appear to me, to be one and\r\nthe same continued ridge of mountains, separating everywhere the waters\r\nof the Adriatic Gulf from those of the Mediterranean. Where it forms an\r\nelbow, touching the Mediterranean, as a smaller circle touches a larger,\r\nwithin which it is inscribed, in the manner of a tangent, the name\r\nchanges from Alps to Apennine. It is the beginning of the Apennine which\r\nconstitutes the State of Genoa, the mountains there generally falling\r\ndown in barren naked precipices into the sea. Wherever there is soil on\r\nthe lower parts, it is principally in olives and figs, in vines also,\r\nmulberries, and corn. Where there are hollows well protected, there are\r\noranges. This is the case at Golfo de Laspeze, Sestri, Bugiasco, Nervi,\r\nGenoa, Pegli, Savona, Finale, Oneglia, (where there are abundance,)\r\nSt. Remo, Ventimiglia, Mantone, and Monaco. Noli, into which I was\r\nobliged to put, by a change of wind, is forty miles from Genoa. There\r\nare twelve hundred inhabitants in the village, and many separate houses\r\nround about. One of the precipices hanging over the sea is covered with\r\naloes. But neither here, nor anywhere else I have been, could I procure\r\nsatisfactory information that they ever flower. The current of testimony\r\nis to the contrary. Noli furnishes many fishermen. Paths penetrate up\r\ninto the mountains in several directions, about three-fourths of a mile;\r\nbut these are practicable only for asses and mules. I saw no cattle nor\r\nsheep in the settlement. The wine they make, is white and indifferent.\r\nA curious cruet for oil and vinegar in one piece, I saw here. A bishop\r\nresides here, whose revenue is two thousand livres, equal to sixty-six\r\nguineas. I heard a nightingale here.\r\n\r\nApril 29th. _Albenga._ In walking along the shore from Louano to this\r\nplace, I saw no appearance of shells. The tops of the mountains are\r\ncovered with snow, while there are olive trees, &c. on the lower parts. I\r\ndo not remember to have seen assigned anywhere, the cause of the apparent\r\ncolor of the sea. Its water is generally clear and colorless, if taken\r\nup and viewed in a glass. That of the Mediterranean is remarkably so.\r\nYet in the mass, it assumes, _by reflection_, the color of the sky or\r\natmosphere, black, green, blue, according to the state of the weather.\r\nIf any person wished to retire from his acquaintance, to live absolutely\r\nunknown, and yet in the midst of physical enjoyments, it should be in\r\nsome of the little villages of this coast, where air, water and earth\r\nconcur to offer what each has, most precious. Here are nightingales,\r\nbeccaficas, ortolans, pheasants, partridges, quails, a superb climate,\r\nand the power of changing it from summer to winter at any moment, by\r\nascending the mountains. The earth furnishes wine, oil, figs, oranges,\r\nand every production of the garden, in every season. The sea yields\r\nlobsters, crabs, oysters, thunny, sardines, anchovies, &c. Ortolans sell\r\nat this time, at thirty sous, equal to one shilling sterling, the dozen.\r\nAt this season, they must be fattened. Through the whole of my route from\r\nMarseilles, I observe they plant a great deal of cane or reed, which\r\nis convenient while growing, as a cover from the cold and boisterous\r\nwinds, and when cut, it serves for espaliers to vines, peas, &c. Through\r\nPiedmont, Lombardy, the Milanese, and Genoese, the garden bean is a\r\ngreat article of culture; almost as much so as corn. At Albenga, is a\r\nrich plain opening from between two ridges of mountains, triangularly,\r\nto the sea, and of several miles extent. Its growth is olives, figs,\r\nmulberries, vines, corn, and beans. There is some pasture. A bishop\r\nresides here, whose revenue is forty thousand livres. This place is said\r\nto be rendered unhealthy in summer, by the river which passes through\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nApril 30th. _Oneglia._ The wind continuing contrary, I took mules\r\nat Albenga for Oneglia. Along this tract are many of the tree called\r\ncarroubier, being a species of locust. It is the ceratonia siliqua of\r\nLinnæus. Its pods furnish food for horses, and also for the poor, in time\r\nof scarcity. It abounds in Naples and Spain. Oneglia and Port Maurice,\r\nwhich are within a mile of each other, are considerable places, and in\r\na rich country. At St. Remo, are abundance of oranges and lemons, and\r\nsome palm trees.\r\n\r\nMay 1st. _Ventimiglia._ _Menton._ _Monaco._ _Nice._ At Bordighera,\r\nbetween Ventimiglia and Menton, are extensive plantations of palms, on\r\nthe hill as well as in the plain. They bring fruit, but it does not\r\nripen. Something is made of the midrib, which is in great demand at\r\nRome, on the Palm Sunday, and which renders this tree profitable here.\r\nFrom Menton to Monaco, there is more good land, and extensive groves\r\nof oranges and lemons. Orange water sells here at forty sous, equal to\r\nsixteen pence sterling, the American quart. The distances on this coast,\r\nare, from Laspeze, at the eastern end of the territories of Genoa to\r\nGenoa, fifty-five miles, geometrical; to Savona, thirty; Albenga, thirty;\r\nOneglia, twenty; Ventimiglia, twenty-five; Monaco, ten; Nice, ten; in\r\nthe whole, one hundred and eighty miles. A superb road might be made\r\nalong the margin of the sea from Laspeze, where the champaign country\r\nof Italy opens, to Nice, where the Alps go off northwardly, and the\r\npost roads of France begin; and it might even follow the margin of the\r\nsea quite to Cette. By this road, travellers would enter Italy without\r\ncrossing the Alps, and all the little insulated villages of the Genoese\r\nwould communicate together, and in time form one continued village along\r\nthat road.\r\n\r\nMay 3d. _Luc._ _Brignolles._ _Tourves._ _Pourcieux._ _La Galiniere._ Long,\r\nsmall mountains, very rocky, the soil reddish from bad to middling; in\r\nolives, grapes, mulberries, vines and corn. Brignolles is in an extensive\r\nplain, between two ridges of mountains, and along a water course which\r\ncontinues to Tourves. Thence to Pourcieux we cross a mountain, low and\r\neasy. The country is rocky and poor. To la Galiniere are waving grounds,\r\nbounded by mountains of rock at a little distance. There are some\r\ninclosures of dry wall from Luc to la Galiniere; also, sheep and hogs.\r\nThere is snow on the high mountains. I see no plums in the vicinities of\r\nBrignolles; which makes me conjecture that the celebrated plum of that\r\nname, is not derived from this place.\r\n\r\nMay 8. _Orgon._ _Avignon._ _Vaucluse._ Orgon is on the Durance. From\r\nthence, its plain opens till it becomes common with that of the Rhone; so\r\nthat from Orgon to Avignon is entirely a plain of rich dark loam, which\r\nis in willows, mulberries, vines, corn and pasture. A very few figs. I\r\nsee no olives in this plain. Probably the cold winds have too much power\r\nhere. From the Bac de Nova (where we cross the Durance) to Avignon, is\r\nabout nine American miles; and from the same Bac to Vaucluse, eleven\r\nmiles. In the valley of Vaucluse, and on the hills impending over it,\r\nare olive trees. The stream issuing from the fountain of Vaucluse is\r\nabout twenty yards wide, four or five feet deep, and of such rapidity\r\nthat it could not be stemmed by a canoe. They are now mowing hay, and\r\ngathering mulberry leaves. The high mountains just back of Vaucluse are\r\ncovered with snow. Fine trout in the stream of Vaucluse, and the valley\r\nabounds peculiarly with nightingales. The vin blanc de M. de Rochequde\r\nof Avignon, resembles dry Lisbon. He sells it at six years old for\r\ntwenty-two sous the bottle, the price of the bottle, &c., included.\r\n\r\n_Avignon._ _Remoulins._ Some good plains, but generally hills, stony\r\nand poor. In olives, mulberries, vines and corn. Where it is waste the\r\ngrowth is, chene-vert, box, furze, thyme and rosemary.\r\n\r\nMay 10. _Nismes._ _Lunel._ Hills on the right, plains on the left. The\r\nsoil reddish, a little stony, and of middling quality. The produce,\r\nolives, mulberries, vines, corn, St. foin. No wood and few inclosures.\r\nLunel is famous for its vin de muscat blanc, thence called Lunel, or vin\r\nmuscat de Lunel. It is made from the raisin muscat, without fermenting\r\nthe grain in the hopper. When fermented it makes a red muscat, taking the\r\ntinge from the dissolution of the skin of the grape, which injures the\r\nquality. When a red muscat is required, they prefer coloring it with a\r\nlittle Alicant wine. But the white is best. The piece of two hundred and\r\nforty bottles, after being properly drawn off from its lees, and ready\r\nfor bottling, costs from one hundred and twenty to two hundred livres,\r\nthe first quality and last vintage. It cannot be bought old, the demand\r\nbeing sufficient to take it all the first year. They are not more than\r\nfrom fifty to one hundred pieces a year, made of this first quality. A\r\n_setterie_ yields about one piece, and my informer supposes there are\r\nabout two setteries in an arpent. Portage to Paris by land is fifteen\r\nlivres the quintal. The best _recoltes_ are these of M. Bouquet and M.\r\nTremoulet. The vines are in rows four feet apart, every way.\r\n\r\nMay 11. _Montpelier._ Snow on the Cevennes, still visible from here.\r\nWith respect to the muscat grape, of which the wine is made, there are\r\ntwo kinds, the red and the white. The first has a red skin, but a white\r\njuice. If it be fermented in the cuve, the coloring matter which resides\r\nin the skin is imparted to the wine. If not fermented in the cuve, the\r\nwine is white. Of the white grape, only a white wine can be made. The\r\nspecies of St. foin cultivated here by the name of sparsette, is the\r\nhedysarum onobryches. They cultivate a great deal of madder (garance)\r\nrubia tinctorum here, which is said to be immensely profitable. Monsieur\r\nde Gouan tells me that the pine, of which they use the burs for fuel,\r\nis the pinus sativus, being two leaved. They use for an edging to the\r\nborders of their gardens, the santolina, which they call garderobe. I\r\nfind the yellow clover here, in a garden; and the large pigeon succeeding\r\nwell, confined in a house.\r\n\r\nMay 12. _Frontignan._ Some tolerably good plains in olives, vines, corn,\r\nSt. foin, and lucerne. A great proportion of the hills are waste. There\r\nare some inclosures of stone, and some sheep. The first four years of\r\nmadder are unproductive; the fifth and sixth yield the whole value of\r\nthe land. Then it must be renewed. The sparsette is the common or true\r\nSt. foin. It lasts about five years; in the best land it is cut twice,\r\nin May and September, and yields three thousand pounds of dry hay to\r\nthe setterie, the first cutting, and five hundred pounds the second.\r\nThe setterie is of seventy-five _dextres en tout sens_, supposed about\r\ntwo arpents. Lucerne is the best of all forage; it is sowed here in the\r\nbroadcast, and lasts about twelve or fourteen years. It is cut four\r\ntimes a year, and yields six thousand pounds of dry hay at the four\r\ncuttings, to the setterie. The territory in which the vin muscat de\r\nFrontignan is made, is about a league of three thousand toises long,\r\nand one-fourth of a league broad. The soil is reddish and stony, often\r\nas much stone as soil. On the left, it is a plain, on the right, hills.\r\nThere are made about one thousand pieces (of two hundred and fifty bottles\r\neach) annually, of which six hundred are of the first quality, made on\r\nthe _coteaux_. Of these, Madame Soubeinan makes two hundred, Monsieur\r\nReboulle, ninety. Monsieur Lambert, médicin de la faculté de Montpelier,\r\nsixty, Monsieur Thomas, notaire, fifty, Monsieur Argilliers, fifty,\r\nMonsieur Audibert, forty; equal to four hundred and ninety; and there\r\nare some small proprietors who make small quantities. The first quality\r\nis sold, _brut_, for one hundred and twenty livres the piece; but it is\r\nthen thick, and must have a winter and the _fouet_ to render it potable\r\nand brilliant. The fouet is like a chocolate mill, the handle of iron,\r\nthe brush of stiff hair. In bottles, this wine costs twenty-four sous,\r\nthe bottles, &c., included. It is potable the April after it is made,\r\nis best that year, and after ten years begins to have a pitchy taste,\r\nresembling it to Malaga. It is not permitted to ferment more than half\r\na day, because it would not be so liquorish. The best color, and its\r\nnatural one, is the amber. By force of whipping, it is made white, but\r\nloses favor. There are but two or three pieces a year of red muscat\r\nmade; there being but one vineyard of the red grape, which belongs to\r\na baker called Pascal. This sells in bottles at thirty sous, the bottle\r\nincluded. Rondelle, negociant en vin, Porte St. Bernard, fauxbourg St.\r\nGermains, Paris, buys three hundred pieces of the first quality every\r\nyear. The coteaux yield about half a piece to the setterie, the plains a\r\nwhole piece. The inferior quality is not at all esteemed. It is bought\r\nby the merchants of Cette, as is also the wine of Bezieres, and sold\r\nby them for Frontignan of the first quality. They sell thirty thousand\r\npieces a year under that name. The town of Frontignan marks its casks\r\nwith a hot iron: an individual of that place having two casks emptied,\r\nwas offered forty livres for the empty cask by a merchant of Cette. The\r\ntown of Frontignan contains about two thousand inhabitants; it is almost\r\non the level of the ocean. Transportation to Paris is fifteen livres the\r\nquintal, and takes fifteen days. The price of packages is about eight\r\nlivres eight sous the one hundred bottles. A setterie of good vineyard\r\nsells for from three hundred and fifty to five hundred livres, and rents\r\nfor fifty livres. A laboring man hires at one hundred and fifty livres\r\nthe year, and is fed and lodged; a woman at half as much. Wheat sells\r\nat ten livres the settier, which weighs one hundred pounds, poids de\r\ntable. They make some Indian corn here, which is eaten by the poor. The\r\nolives do not extend northward of this into the country, above twelve\r\nor fifteen leagues. In general, the olive country in Languedoc is about\r\nfifteen leagues broad. More of the waste lands between Frontignan and\r\nMirval are capable of culture; but it is a marshy country, very subject\r\nto fever and ague, and generally unhealthy. Thence arises, as is said,\r\na want of hands.\r\n\r\n_Cette._ There are in this town about ten thousand inhabitants. Its\r\nprincipal commerce is wine; it furnishes great quantities of grape pomice\r\nfor making verdigrise. They have a very growing commerce; but it is kept\r\nunder by the privileges of Marseilles.\r\n\r\nMay 13. _Agde._ On the right of the Etang de Tau, are plains of some\r\nwidth, then hills, in olives, vines, mulberry, corn and pasture. On the\r\nleft, a narrow sand bar separating the Etang from the sea, along which\r\nit is proposed to make a road from Cette to Agde. In this case, the\r\npost would lead from Montpelier, by Cette and Agde, to Bezieres, being\r\nleveller, and an hour, or an hour and a half nearer. Agde contains six\r\nor eight thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMay 14. _Bezieres._ Rich plains in corn, St. foin and pasture; hills at a\r\nlittle distance to the right, in olives; the soil both of hill and plain\r\nis red, going from Agde to Bezieres. But at Bezieres the country becomes\r\nhilly, and is in olives, St. foin, pasture, some vines and mulberries.\r\n\r\nMay 15. _Bezieres._ _Argilies._ _Le Saumal._ From Argilies to Saumal are\r\nconsiderable plantations of vines. Those on the red hills to the right,\r\nare said to produce good wine. No wood, no inclosures. There are sheep\r\nand good cattle. The Pyrenees are covered with snow. I am told they are\r\nso in certain parts all the year. The canal of Languedoc, along which I\r\nnow travel, is six toises wide at bottom, and ten toises at the surface\r\nof the water, which is one toise deep. The barks which navigate it\r\nare seventy and eighty feet long, and seventeen or eighteen feet wide.\r\nThey are drawn by one horse, and worked by two hands, one of which is\r\ngenerally a woman. The locks are mostly kept by women, but the necessary\r\noperations are much too laborious for them. The encroachments by the\r\nmen, on the offices proper for the women, is a great derangement in the\r\norder of things. Men are shoemakers, tailors, upholsterers, stay-makers,\r\nmantua-makers, cooks, housekeepers, house-cleaners, bed-makers, they\r\n_coeffe_ the ladies, and bring them to bed: the women, therefore, to\r\nlive, are obliged to undertake the offices which they abandon. They\r\nbecome porters, carters, reapers, sailors, lock-keepers, smiters on the\r\nanvil, cultivators of the earth, &c. Can we wonder, if such of them as\r\nhave a little beauty, prefer easier courses to get their livelihood, as\r\nlong as that beauty lasts? Ladies who employ men in the offices which\r\nshould be reserved for their sex, are they not bawds in effect? For every\r\nman whom they thus employ, some girl, whose place he has thus taken, is\r\ndriven to whoredom. The passage of the eight locks at Bezieres, that\r\nis, from the opening of the first to the last gate, took one hour and\r\nthirty-three minutes. The bark in which I go, is about thirty-five feet\r\nlong, drawn by one horse, and goes from two to three geographical miles\r\nan hour. The canal yields abundance of carp and eel. I see also small\r\nfish resembling our perch and chub. Some plants of white clover and\r\nsome of yellow, on the banks of the canal near Capestan; santolina also,\r\nand a great deal of yellow iris. Met a raft of about three hundred and\r\nfifty beams, forty feet long, and twelve or thirteen inches in diameter,\r\nformed into fourteen rafts, tacked together. The extensive and numerous\r\nfields of St. foin in general bloom, are beautiful.\r\n\r\nMay 16th. _Le Saumal._ _Marseillette._ May 17th. _Marseillette._\r\n_Carcassonne._ From Saumal to Carcassonne, we have always the river Aube\r\nclose on our left. This river runs in the valley between the Cevennes\r\nand Pyrenees, serving as the common receptacle for both their waters. It\r\nis from fifty to one hundred and fifty yards wide, always rapid, rocky,\r\nand insusceptible of navigation. The canal passes in the side of hills\r\nmade by that river, overlooks the river itself, and its plains, and has\r\nits prospect ultimately terminated, on one side, by mountains of rock\r\novertopped by the Pyrenees, on the other, by small mountains, sometimes of\r\nrock, sometimes of soil, overtopped by the Cevennes. Marseillette is on\r\na ridge, which separates the river Aube from the Etang de Marseillette.\r\nThe canal, in its approach to this village, passes the ridge, and rides\r\nalong the front, overlooking the Etang, and the plains on its border;\r\nand having passed the village, re-crosses the ridge, and resumes its\r\ngeneral ground in front of the Aube. The land is in corn, St. foin,\r\npasture, vines, mulberries, willows, and olives.\r\n\r\nMay 18th. _Carcassonne._ _Castelnaudari._ Opposite to Carcassonne, the\r\ncanal receives the river Fresquel, about thirty yards wide, which is\r\nits substantial supply of water from hence to Bezieres. From Bezieres\r\nto Agde, the river Orb furnishes it, and the Eraut, from Agde to the\r\nEtang de Thau. By means of _ecluse ronde_ at Agde, the waters of the\r\nEraut can be thrown towards Bezieres, to aid those of the Orb, as far as\r\nthe ecluse de Porcaraigne, nine geometrical miles. Where the Fresquel\r\nenters the canal, there is, on the opposite side, a waste, to let off\r\nthe superfluous waters. The horseway is continued over this waste, by\r\na bridge of stone of eighteen arches. I observe them fishing in the\r\ncanal, with a skimming net of about fifteen feet diameter, with which\r\nthey tell me they catch carp. Flax in blossom. Neither strawberries\r\nnor peas yet at Carcassonne. The Windsor bean just come to table. From\r\nthe ecluse de la Lande we see the last olive trees near a metairée, or\r\nfarm house, called la Lande. On a review of what I have seen and heard\r\nof this tree, the following seem to be its northern limits. Beginning\r\non the Atlantic, at the Pyrenees, and along them to the meridian of\r\nla Lande, or of Carcassonne; up that meridian to the Cevennes, as they\r\nbegin just there to raise themselves high enough to afford it shelter.\r\nAlong the Cevennes, to the parallel of forty-five degrees of latitude,\r\nand along that parallel (crossing the Rhone near the mouth of the Isere)\r\nto the Alps; thence along the Alps and Apennines, to what parallel of\r\nlatitude I know not. Yet here the tracing of the line becomes the most\r\ninteresting. For from the Atlantic, so far, we see this production the\r\neffect of shelter and latitude combined. But where does it venture to\r\nlaunch forth unprotected by shelter, and by the mere force of latitude\r\nalone? Where for instance does its northern limits cross the Adriatic?\r\nI learn that the olive tree resists cold to eight degrees of Reaumur\r\nbelow the freezing point, which corresponds to fourteen above zero of\r\nFarenheit; and that the orange resists to four degrees below freezing\r\nof Reaumur, which is twenty-three degrees above zero of Farenheit.\r\n\r\nMay 19th. _Castelnaudari._ _St. Feriol._ _Escamaze._ _Lampy._ Some sheep\r\nand cattle; no inclosures. St. Feriol, Escamaze, and Lampy are in the\r\n_montagnes noires_. The country almost entirely waste. Some of it in\r\nshrubbery. The _voute_ d'Escamaze is of one hundred and thirty-five\r\nyards. Round about Castelnaudari, the country is hilly, as it has been\r\nconstantly from Bezieres; it is very rich. Where it is plain, or nearly\r\nplain, the soil is black; in general, however, it is hilly and reddish,\r\nand in corn. They cultivate a great deal of Indian corn here, which they\r\ncall millet; it is planted but not yet up.\r\n\r\nMay 20th. _Castelnaudari._ _Naurouze._ _Villefranche._ _Baziege._ At\r\nNaurouze, is the highest ground which the canal had to pass, between the\r\ntwo seas. It became necessary then to find water still higher to bring\r\nit here. The river Fresquel heading by its two principal branches in\r\nthe montagnes noires, a considerable distance off to the eastward, the\r\nsprings of the most western one were brought together, and conducted\r\nto Naurouze, where its waters are divided, part furnishing the canal\r\ntowards the ocean, the rest towards the Mediterranean, as far as the\r\necluse de Fresquel, where, as has been before noted, the Lampy branch,\r\nand the Alzau, under the name of the Fresquel, enter.\r\n\r\nMay 20th. They have found that a lock of six pieds is best; however,\r\neight pieds is well enough. Beyond this, it is bad. Monsieur Pin tells\r\nme of a lock of thirty pieds, made in Sweden, of which it is impossible\r\nto open the gates. They therefore divided it into four locks. The small\r\ngates of the locks of this canal, have six square pieds of surface. They\r\ntried the machinery of the jack for opening them. They were more easily\r\nopened, but very subject to be deranged, however strongly made. They\r\nreturned therefore to the original wooden screw, which is excessively\r\nslow and laborious. I calculate that five minutes are lost at every\r\nbasin by this screw, which, on the whole number of basis, is one eighth\r\nof the time necessary to navigate the canal; and of course, if a method\r\nof lifting the gate at one stroke could be found, it would reduce the\r\npassage from eight to seven days, and the freight equally. I suggested\r\nto Monsieur Pin and others, a quadrantal gate, turning on a pivot, and\r\nlifted by a lever like a pump handle, aided by a windlass and cord, if\r\nnecessary. He will try it, and inform me of the success. The price of\r\ntransportation from Cette to Bourdeaux, through the canal and Garonne is\r\n---- the quintal; round by the straits of Gibraltar is ----. Two hundred\r\nand forty barks, the largest of twenty-two hundred quintals (or say, in\r\ngeneral, of one hundred tons) suffice to perform the business of this\r\ncanal, which is stationary, having neither increased nor diminished for\r\nmany years. When pressed, they can pass and repass between Toulouse and\r\nBezieres in fourteen days; but sixteen is the common period. The canal\r\nis navigated ten and a half months of the year; the other month and a\r\nhalf being necessary to lay it dry, cleanse it and repair the works.\r\nThis is done in July and August, when there would, perhaps, be a want\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nMay 21st. _Baziege._ _Toulouse._ The country continues hilly, but very\r\nrich. It is in mulberries, willows, some vines, corn, maize, pasture,\r\nbeans, flax. A great number of chateaux and good houses, in the\r\nneighborhood of the canal. The people partly in farm houses, partly in\r\nvillages. I suspect the farm houses are occupied by the farmers, while\r\nthe laborers (who are mostly by the day) reside in the villages. Neither\r\nstrawberries nor peas yet at Baziege or Toulouse. Near the latter, are\r\nsome fields of yellow clover.\r\n\r\nAt Toulouse the canal ends. It has four communications with the\r\nMediterranean. 1. Through the ponds of Thau, Frontignan, Palavas,\r\nMaguelone, and Manjo, the canal de la Radela Aiguesmortes, le canal des\r\nSalines de Pecair, and the arm of the Rhone called Bras de fer, which\r\nends at Fourgues, opposite to Arles, and thence down the Rhone. 2. At\r\nCette, by a canal of a few hundred toises, leading out of the Etang de\r\nThau into the sea. The vessels pass the Etang, through a length of nine\r\nthousand toises, with sails. 3. At Agde, by the river Eraut, twenty-five\r\nhundred toises. It has but five or six pieds of water at its mouth. It\r\nis joined to the canal at the upper part of this communication, by a\r\nbranch of a canal two hundred and seventy toises long. 4. At Narbonne, by\r\na canal they are now opening, which leads from the great canal near the\r\naqueduct of the river Cesse, twenty-six hundred toises, into the Aude.\r\nThis new canal will have five lock-basins of about twelve pieds fall,\r\neach. Then you are to cross the Aude very obliquely, and descend a branch\r\nof it six thousand toises, through four lock-basins to Narbonne, and\r\nfrom Narbonne down the same branch, twelve hundred toises into the Etang\r\nde Sigen, across that Etang four thousand toises, issuing at an inlet,\r\ncalled Grau de la nouvelle, into the Gulph of Lyons. But only vessels of\r\nthirty or forty tons can enter this inlet. Of these four communications,\r\nthat of Cette only, leads to a deep sea-port, because the exit is there\r\nby a canal, and not a river. Those by the Rhone, Eraut, and Aude, are\r\nblocked up by bars at the mouths of those rivers. It is remarkable, that\r\nall the rivers running into the Mediterranean, are obstructed at their\r\nentrance by bars and shallows, which often change their position. This\r\nis the case with the Nile, Tyber, the Po, the Lez, le Lyoron, the Orbe,\r\nthe Gly, the Tech, the Tet, &c. Indeed, the formation of these bars seems\r\nnot confined to the mouths of the rivers, though it takes place at them,\r\nmore certainly. Along almost the whole of the coast, from Marseilles\r\ntowards the Pyrenees, banks of sand are thrown up, parallel with the\r\ncoast, which have insulated portions of the sea, that is, formed them\r\ninto etangs, ponds, or sounds, through which here and there, narrow and\r\nshallow inlets only, are preserved by the currents of the rivers. These\r\nsounds fill up in time, with the mud and sand deposited in them by the\r\nrivers. Thus the Etang de Vendres, navigated formerly by vessels of sixty\r\ntons, is now nearly filled up by the mud and sand of the Aude. The Vistre\r\nand Vidourle which formerly emptied themselves into the Gulf of Lyons,\r\nare now received by the Etangs de Manjo and Aiguesmortes, that is to say,\r\nthe part of the Gulf of Lyons which formerly received, and still receives\r\nthose rivers, is now cut off from the sea by a bar of sand, which has\r\nbeen thrown up in it, and has formed it into sounds. Other proofs that\r\nthe land gains there on the sea, are, that the towns of St. Gilles and\r\nNotre dame d'asposts, formerly sea ports, are now far from the sea, and\r\nthat Aiguesmortes, where are still to be seen the iron rings to which\r\nvessels were formerly moored, and where St. Louis embarked for Palestine,\r\nhas now in its vicinities, only ponds which cannot be navigated, and\r\ncommunicates with the sea by an inlet, called Grau du roy, through which\r\nonly fishing barks can pass. It is pretty well established, that all the\r\nDelta of Egypt has been formed by the depositions of the Nile, and the\r\nalluvions of the sea, and it is probable that that operation is still\r\ngoing on. Has this peculiarity of the Mediterranean any connection with\r\nthe scantiness of its tides, which even at the equinoxes, are of two or\r\nthree feet only?\r\n\r\nThe communication from the western end of the canal to the ocean is by\r\nthe river Garonne. This is navigated by flat boats of eight hundred\r\nquintals, when the water is well; but when it is scanty, these boats\r\ncarry only two hundred quintals till they get to the mouth of the Tarn.\r\nIt has been proposed to open a canal that far, from Toulouse, along the\r\nright side of the river.\r\n\r\nMay 22d. _Toulouse._ 23d. _Agen._ 24th. _Castres._ _Bourdeaux._ The\r\nGaronne and rivers emptying into it, make extensive and rich plains, which\r\nare in mulberries, willows, corn, maize, pasture, beans and flax. The\r\nhills are in corn, maize, beans, and a considerable proportion of vines.\r\nThere seems to be as much maize as corn in this country. Of the latter,\r\nthere is more rye than wheat. The maize is now up, and about three inches\r\nhigh. It is sowed in rows two feet, or two and a half feet apart, and\r\nis pretty thick in the row. Doubtless they mean to thin it. There is a\r\ngreat deal of forage they call farouche. It is a species of red trefoil,\r\nwith few leaves, a very coarse stalk, and a cylindrical blossom of two\r\ninches in length, and three quarters of an inch in diameter, consisting\r\nof floscules, exactly as does that of the red clover. It seems to be a\r\ncoarse food, but very plentiful. They say it is for their oxen. These\r\nare very fine, large, and cream-colored. The services of the farm, and\r\nof transportation, are performed chiefly by them. There are a few horses\r\nand asses, but no mules. Even in the city of Bourdeaux, we see scarcely\r\nany beasts of draught but oxen. When we cross the Garonne at Langon,\r\nwe find the plains entirely of sand and gravel, and they continue so to\r\nBourdeaux. Where they are capable of anything, they are in vines, which\r\nare in rows, four, five, or six feet apart, and sometimes more. Near\r\nLangon is Sauterne, where the best white wines of Bourdeaux are made. The\r\nwaste lands are in fern, furze, shrubbery, and dwarf trees. The farmers\r\nlive on their farms. At Agen, Castres, Bourdeaux, strawberries and peas\r\nare now brought to table, so that the country on the canal of Languedoc\r\nseems to have later seasons than that east and west of it. What can be\r\nthe cause? To the eastward, the protection of the Cevennes makes the\r\nwarm season advance sooner. Does the neighborhood of the Mediterranean\r\nco-operate? And does that of the ocean mollify and advance the season\r\nto the westward? There are ortolans at Agen, but none at Bourdeaux. The\r\nbuildings on the canal and the Garonne are mostly of brick, the size\r\nof the bricks the same with that of the ancient Roman brick, as seen in\r\nthe remains of their buildings in this country. In those of a circus at\r\nBourdeaux, considerable portions of which are standing, I measured the\r\nbricks, and found them nineteen or twenty inches long, eleven or twelve\r\ninches wide, and from one and a half to two inches thick; their texture\r\nas fine, compact, and solid as that of porcelain. The bricks now made,\r\nthough of the same dimensions, are not so fine. They are burnt in a\r\nkind of furnace, and make excellent work. The elm tree shows itself at\r\nBourdeaux, peculiarly proper for being spread flat for arbors. Many are\r\ndone in, this way on the quay des Charterons. Strawberries, peas, and\r\ncherries at Bourdeaux.\r\n\r\nMay 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th. _Bourdeaux._ The cantons in which the\r\nmost celebrated wines of Bourdeaux are made, are Medoc down the river,\r\nGrave adjoining the city, and the parishes next above; all on the same\r\nside of the river. In the first is made red wine principally, in the\r\ntwo last, white. In Medoc, they plant the vines in cross rows of three\r\nand a half pieds. They keep them so low, that poles extended along the\r\nrows one way, horizontally, about fifteen or eighteen inches above the\r\nground, serve to tie the vines to, and leave the cross row open to the\r\nplough. In Grave, they set the plants in quincunx, _i. e._ in equilateral\r\ntriangles of three and a half pieds every side; and they stick a pole\r\nof six or eight feet high to every vine, separately. The vine stock is\r\nsometimes three or four feet high. They find these two methods equal in\r\nculture, duration, quantity and quality. The former, however, admits the\r\nalternative of tending by hand or with the plough. The grafting of the\r\nvine, though a critical operation, is practised with success. When the\r\ngraft has taken, they bend it into the earth, and let it take root above\r\nthe scar. They begin to yield an indifferent wine at three years old,\r\nbut not a good one till twenty-five years, nor after eighty, when they\r\nbegin to yield less, and worse, and must be renewed. They give three or\r\nfour workings in the year, each worth seventy, or seventy-five livres\r\nthe _journal_, which is of eight hundred and forty square toises, and\r\ncontains about three thousand plants. They dung a little in Medoc and\r\nGrave, because of the poverty of the soil; but very little, as more would\r\neffect the wine. The journal yields, _communibus annis_, about three\r\npieces (of two hundred and forty or two hundred and fifty bottles each).\r\nThe vineyards of first quality are all worked by their proprietors.\r\nThose of the second rent for three hundred livres the journal, those\r\nof the third at two hundred livres. They employ a kind of overseer at\r\nfour or five hundred livres the year, finding him lodging and drink;\r\nbut he feeds himself. He superintends and directs, though he is expected\r\nto work but little. If the proprietor has a garden, the overseer tends\r\nthat. They never hire laborers by the year. The day wages for a man are\r\nthirty sous, a woman's fifteen sous, feeding themselves. The women make\r\nthe bundles of sarment, weed, pull off the snails, tie the vines, and\r\ngather the grapes. During the vintage, they are paid high and fed well.\r\n\r\nOf red wines, there are four vineyards of the first quality, viz., 1.\r\nChâteau Margau, belonging to the Marquis d'Agincourt, who makes about\r\none hundred and fifty tons, of one thousand bottles each. He has engaged\r\nto Jernon, a merchant. 2. La Tour de Segur, en Saint Lambert, belonging\r\nto Monsieur Miresmenil, who makes one hundred and twenty-five tons.\r\n3. Hautbrion, belonging two thirds to M. le Comte de Femelle, who has\r\nengaged to Barton, a merchant; the other third to the Comte de Toulouse,\r\nat Toulouse. The whole is seventy-five tons. 4. Château de la Fite,\r\nbelonging to the President Pichard, at Bourdeaux, who makes one hundred\r\nand seventy-five tons. The wines of the three first are not in perfection\r\ntill four years old; those of De la Fite, being somewhat lighter, are\r\ngood at three years, that is, the crop of 1786 is good in the spring of\r\n1789. These growths of the year 1783 sell now at two thousand livres the\r\nton; those of 1784, on account of the superior quality of that vintage,\r\nsell at twenty-four hundred livres; those of 1785, at eighteen hundred\r\nlivres; those of 1786, at eighteen hundred livres, though they had sold at\r\nfirst for only fifteen hundred livres. Red wines of the second quality,\r\nare Rozan, Dabbadie or Lionville, la Rose, Quirouen, Durfort; in all\r\neight hundred tons, which sell at one thousand livres, new. The third\r\nclass are, Calons, Mouton, Gassie, Arboete, Pontette, de Ferme, Candale;\r\nin all two thousand tons, at eight or nine hundred livres. After these,\r\nthey are reckoned common wines, and sell from five hundred livres down\r\nto one hundred and twenty livres the ton. All red wines decline after\r\na certain age, losing color, flavor and body. Those of Bourdeaux begin\r\nto decline at about seven years old.\r\n\r\nOf white wines, those made in the canton of Grave are most esteemed at\r\nBourdeaux. The best crops are, 1. Pontac, which formerly belonged to M.\r\nde Pontac, but now to M. de Lamont. He makes forty tons, which sell at\r\nfour hundred livres, new. 2. St. Brise, belonging to M. de Pontac; thirty\r\ntons, at three hundred and fifty livres. 3. De Carbonius, belonging to the\r\nBenedictine monks, who make fifty tons, and never selling till three or\r\nfour years old, get eight hundred livres the ton. Those made in the three\r\nparishes next above Grave, and more esteemed at Paris, are, 1. Sauterne.\r\nThe best crop belonging to M. Diquem at Bourdeaux, or to M. de Salus,\r\nhis son-in-law; one hundred and fifty tons, at three hundred livres,\r\nnew, and six hundred livres, old. The next best crop is M. de Filotte's;\r\none hundred tons, sold at the same price. 2. Prignac. The best is the\r\nPresident du Roy's, at Bourdeaux. He makes one hundred and seventy-five\r\ntons, which sell at three hundred livres, new, and six hundred livres,\r\nold. Those of 1784, for their extraordinary quality, sell at eight hundred\r\nlivres. 3. Barsac. The best belongs to the President Pichard, who makes\r\none hundred and fifty tons, at two hundred and eighty livres, new, and\r\nsix hundred livres, old. Sauterne is the pleasantest; next Prignac, and\r\nlastly Barsac; but Barsac is the strongest; next Prignac, and lastly\r\nSauterne; and all stronger than Grave. There are other good crops made\r\nin the same parishes of Sauterne, Prignac, and Barsac; but none as good\r\nas these. There is a virgin wine, which, though made of a red grape,\r\nis of a light rose color, because, being made without pressure, the\r\ncoloring matter of the skin does not mix with the juice. There are other\r\nwhite wines, from the preceding prices down to seventy-five livres. In\r\ngeneral, the white wines keep longest. They will be in perfection till\r\nfifteen or twenty years of age. The best vintage now to be bought, is\r\nof 1784; both of red and white. There has been no other good year since\r\n1779.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated vineyards before mentioned are plains, as is generally\r\nthe canton of Medoc, and that of the Grave. The soil of Hautbrion,\r\nparticularly, which I examined, is a sand, in which is near as much round\r\ngravel or small stone, and very little loam; and this is the general soil\r\nof Medoc. That of Pontac, which I examined also, is a little different.\r\nIt is clayey, with a fourth or fifth of fine rotten stone; and at two\r\nfeet depth it becomes all a rotten stone. M. de Lamont tells me he has a\r\nkind of grape without seeds, which I did not formerly suppose to exist;\r\nbut I saw at Marseilles dried raisins from Smyrna without seeds. I saw\r\nin his farm at Pontac some plants of white clover, and a good deal of\r\nyellow; also some small peach trees in the open ground. The principal\r\nEnglish wine merchants at Bourdeaux are, Jemon, Barton, Johnston, Foster,\r\nSkinner, Copinger and M'Cartey; the chief French wine merchants are,\r\nFeger, Nerac, Bruneau, Jauge, and du Verget. Desgrands, a wine broker,\r\ntells me they never mix the wines of first quality; but that they mix\r\nthe inferior ones to improve them. The smallest wines make the best\r\nbrandy. They yield about a fifth or sixth.\r\n\r\nMay 28th, 29th. From Bordeaux to Blaye, the country near the river\r\nis hilly, chiefly in vines, some corn, some pasture; further out, are\r\nplains, boggy and waste. The soil, in both cases, clay and grit. Some\r\nsheep on the waste. To Etauliere, we have sometimes boggy plains,\r\nsometimes waving grounds and sandy, always poor, generally waste, in\r\nfern and furze, with some corn however, interspersed. To Mirambeau and\r\nSt. Genis, it is hilly, poor, and mostly waste. There are some corn and\r\nmaize however, and better trees than usual. Towards Pons, it becomes a\r\nlittle red, mostly rotten stone. There are vines, corn, and maize, which\r\nis up. At Pons we approach the Clarenton; the country becomes better,\r\na blackish mould mixed with a rotten chalky stone; a great many vines,\r\ncorn, maize, and farouche. From Lajart to Saintes and Rochefort, the\r\nsoil is reddish, its foundation a chalky rock, at about a foot depth;\r\nin vines, corn, maize, clover, lucerne, and pasture. There are more and\r\nbetter trees than I have seen in all my journey; a great many apple and\r\ncherry trees; fine cattle and many sheep. May 30th. From Rochefort to le\r\nRochex, it is sometimes hilly and red, with a chalky foundation, middling\r\ngood; in corn, pasture, and some waste; sometimes it is reclaimed marsh,\r\nin clover and corn, except the parts accessible to the tide, which are\r\nin wild grass. About Rochelle, it is a low plain. Towards Usseau, and\r\nhalf way to Marans, level highlands, red, mixed with an equal quantity\r\nof broken chalk; mostly in vines, some corn and pasture; then to Marans\r\nand half way to St. Hermines, it is reclaimed marsh, dark, tolerably\r\ngood, and all in pasture; there we rise to plains a little higher, red,\r\nwith a chalky foundation, boundless to the eye, and altogether in corn\r\nand maize. May 31st. At St. Hermines, the country becomes very hilly, a\r\nred clay mixed with chalky stone, generally waste, in furze and broom,\r\nwith some patches of corn and maize; and so it continues to Chantenay,\r\nand St. Fulgent. Through the whole of this road from Bourdeaux, are\r\nfrequent hedge rows, and small patches of forest wood, not good, yet\r\nbetter than I had seen in the preceding part of my journey. Towards\r\nMontaigu, the soil mends a little; the cultivated parts in corn and\r\npasture, the uncultivated in broom. It is in very small inclosures of\r\nditch and quickset. On approaching the Loire to Nantes, the country\r\nis leveller; the soil from Rochelle to this place, may be said to have\r\nbeen sometimes red, but oftener grey, and always on a chalky foundation.\r\nThe last census, of about 1770, made one hundred and twenty thousand\r\ninhabitants at Nantes. They conjecture there are now one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand, which equals it to Bourdeaux. June 1st, 2d. The country\r\nfrom Nantes to L'Orient is very hilly and poor, the soil grey; nearly\r\nhalf is waste, in furze and broom, among which is some poor grass. The\r\ncultivated parts are in corn, some maize, a good many apple trees; no\r\nvines. All is in small inclosures of quick hedge and ditch. There are\r\npatches and hedge-rows of forest wood, not quite deserving the name of\r\ntimber. The people are mostly in villages; they eat rye bread, and are\r\nragged. The villages announce a general poverty, as does every other\r\nappearance. Women smite on the anvil, and work with the hoe, and cows\r\nare yoked to labor. There are great numbers of cattle, insomuch that\r\nbutter is their staple. Neither asses nor mules; yet it is said that\r\nthe fine mules I have met with on my journey, are raised in Poictou.\r\nThere are but few chateaux here. I observe mill ponds, and hoes with\r\nlong handles. Have they not, in common with us, derived these from\r\nEngland, of which Bretagne is probably a colony? L'Orient is supposed\r\nto contain twenty-five thousand inhabitants. They tell me here, that to\r\nmake a reasonable profit on potash and pearl ash, as bought in America,\r\nthe former should sell at thirty livres, the latter thirty-six livres\r\nthe quintal. Of turpentine they make no use in their vessels. Bayonne\r\nfurnishes pitch enough; but tar is in demand, and ours sells well. The\r\ntower of L'Orient is sixty-five pieds above the level of the sea, one\r\nhundred and twenty pieds high, twenty-five pieds in diameter; the stairs\r\nfour feet radius, and cost thirty-thousand livres, besides the materials\r\nof the old tower.\r\n\r\nJune 3d, 4th, 5th. The country and productions from L'Orient to Rennes,\r\nand from Rennes to Nantes, are precisely similar to those from Nantes to\r\nL'Orient. About Rennes, it is somewhat leveller, perhaps less poor, and\r\nalmost entirely in pasture. The soil always grey. Some small separate\r\nhouses which seem to be the residence of laborers, or very small farmers;\r\nthe walls frequently of mud, and the roofs generally covered with slate.\r\nGreat plantations of walnut, and frequently of pine. Some apple trees\r\nand sweet briar still in bloom, and broom generally so. I have heard no\r\nnightingale since the last day of May. There are gates in this country\r\nmade in such a manner, that the top rail of the gate overshoots backwards\r\nthe hind post, so as to counterpoise the gate, and prevent its swagging.\r\n\r\n_Nantes._ Vessels of eight feet draught only, can come to Nantes. Those\r\nwhich are larger, lie at Point Boeuf, ten leagues below Nantes, and five\r\nleagues above the mouth of the river. There is a continued navigation\r\nfrom Nantes to Paris, through the Loire, the canal de Briare and the\r\nSeine. Carolina rice is preferred to that of Lombardy for the Guinea\r\ntrade, because it requires less water to boil it.\r\n\r\nJune 6th, 7th, 8th. _Nantes._ _Ancenis._ _Angers._ _Tours._ Ascending\r\nthe Loire from Nantes, the road, as far as Angers, leads over the hills,\r\nwhich are grey, oftener below than above mediocrity, and in corn, pasture,\r\nvines, some maize, flax, and hemp. There are no waste lands. About the\r\nlimits of Bretagne and Anjou, which are between Loriottiere and St.\r\nGeorge, the lands change for the better. Here and there, we get views\r\nof the plains on the Loire, of some extent, and good appearance, in corn\r\nand pasture. After passing Angers, the road is raised out of the reach of\r\ninundations, so as at the same time, to ward them off from the interior\r\nplains. It passes generally along the river side; but sometimes leads\r\nthrough the plains, which, after we pass Angers, become extensive and\r\ngood, in corn, pasture, some maize, hemp, flax, peas, and beans; many\r\nwillows, also poplars and walnuts. The flax is near ripe. Sweet briar in\r\ngeneral bloom. Some broom here still, on which the cattle and sheep browse\r\nin winter and spring, when they have no other green food; and the hogs\r\neat the blossoms and pods, in spring and summer. This blossom, though\r\ndisagreeable when smelt in a small quantity, is of delicious fragrance\r\nwhen there is a whole field of it. There are some considerable vineyards\r\nin the river plains, just before we reach Les trois volées, (which is at\r\nthe one hundred and thirty-sixth mile stone) and after that, where the\r\nhills on the left come into view, they are mostly in vines. Their soil\r\nis clayey and stony, a little reddish, and of southern aspect. The hills\r\non the other side of the river, looking to the north, are not in vines.\r\nThere is very good wine made on these hills; not equal indeed to the\r\nBourdeaux of best quality, but to that of good quality, and like it. It\r\nis a great article of exportation from Anjou and Touraine, and probably\r\nis sold abroad, under the name of Bourdeaux. They are now mowing the\r\nfirst crop of hay. All along both hills of the Loire, is a mass of white\r\nstone, not durable, growing black with time, and so soft, that the people\r\ncut their houses out of the solid, with all the partitions, chimnies,\r\ndoors, &c. The hill sides resemble cony burrows, full of inhabitants.\r\nThe borders of the Loire, are almost a continued village. There are many\r\nchateaux; many cattle, sheep, and horses; some asses.\r\n\r\nTours is at the one hundred and nineteenth mile stone. Being desirous\r\nof inquiring here into a fact stated by Voltaire, in his Questions\r\nEncyclopediques, article Coquilles, relative to the growth of shells\r\nunconnected with animal bodies, at the Château of Monsieur de la\r\nSauvagiere, near Tours, I called on Monsieur Gentil, premier secretaire\r\nde l'Intendance, to whom the Intendant had written on my behalf, at\r\nthe request of the Marquis de Chastellux. I stated to him the fact as\r\nadvanced by Voltaire, and found he was, of all men, the best to whom I\r\ncould have addressed myself. He told me he had been in correspondence\r\nwith Voltaire on that very subject, and was perfectly acquainted with\r\nMonsieur de la Sauvagiere, and the Faluniere where the fact is said to\r\nhave taken place. It is at the Château de Grillemont, six leagues from\r\nTours, on the road to Bourdeaux, belonging now to Monsieur d'Orcai. He\r\nsays, that de la Sauvagiere was a man of truth, and might be relied on\r\nfor whatever facts he stated as of his own observations; but that he was\r\novercharged with imagination, which, in matters of opinion and theory,\r\noften led him beyond his facts; that this feature in his character had\r\nappeared principally in what he wrote on the antiquities of Touraine;\r\nbut that, as to the fact in question, he believed him. That he himself,\r\nindeed, had not watched the same identical shells, as Sauvagiere had\r\ndone, growing from small to great; but that he had often seen such\r\nmasses of those shells of all sizes, from a point to a full size, as\r\nto carry conviction to his mind that they were in the act of growing;\r\nthat he had once made a collection of shells for the Emperor's cabinet,\r\nreserving duplicates of them for himself; and that these afforded proofs\r\nof the same fact; that he afterwards gave those duplicates to a Monsieur\r\ndu Verget, a physician of Tours, of great science and candor, who was\r\ncollecting on a larger scale, and who was perfectly in sentiment with\r\nMonsieur de la Sauvagiere, that not only the Faluniere, but many other\r\nplaces about Tours, would convince any unbiassed observer, that shells\r\nare a fruit of the earth, spontaneously produced; and he gave me a copy\r\nof de la Sauvagiere's Recueil de Dissertations, presented by the author\r\nwherein is one Sur la vegetation spontanée des coquilles du Château des\r\nPlaces. So far, I repeat from him. What are we to conclude? That we have\r\nnot materials enough yet, to form any conclusion. The fact stated by\r\nSauvagiere is not against any law of nature, and is therefore possible;\r\nbut it is so little analogous to her habitual processes, that, if true,\r\nit would be extraordinary; that to command our belief, therefore, there\r\nshould be such a suite of observations, as that their untruth would\r\nbe more extraordinary than the existence of the fact they affirm. The\r\nbark of trees, the skin of fruits and animals, the feathers of birds,\r\nreceive their growth and nutriment from the internal circulation of a\r\njuice through the vessels of the individual they cover. We conclude from\r\nanalogy, then, that the shells of the testaceous tribe, receive also\r\ntheir growth from a like internal circulation. If it be urged, that this\r\ndoes not exclude the possibility of a like shell being produced by the\r\npassage of a fluid through the pores of the circumjacent body, whether\r\nof earth, stone, or water; I answer, that it is not within the usual\r\neconomy of nature, to use two processes for one species of production.\r\nWhile I withhold my assent, however, from this hypothesis, I must deny\r\nit to every other I have ever seen, by which their authors pretend to\r\naccount for the origin of shells in high places. Some of these are against\r\nthe laws of nature, and therefore impossible; and others are built on\r\npositions more difficult to assent to, than that of de la Sauvagiere.\r\nThey all suppose the shells to have covered submarine animals, and have\r\nthen to answer the question, How came they fifteen thousand feet above\r\nthe level of the sea? And they answer it, by demanding what cannot be\r\nconceded. One, therefore, who had rather have no opinion than a false\r\none, will suppose this question one of those beyond the investigation\r\nof human sagacity; or wait till further and fuller observations enable\r\nhim to decide it.\r\n\r\n_Chanteloup._ I heard a nightingale to-day at Chanteloup. The gardener\r\nsays, it is the male who alone sings, while the female sits; and that\r\nwhen the young are hatched, he also ceases. In the border at Chanteloup,\r\nis an ingenious contrivance to hide the projecting steps of a stair-case.\r\nThree steps were of necessity to project into the boudoir: they are\r\ntherefore made triangular steps; and instead of being rested on the\r\nfloor, as usual, they are made fast at their broad end to the stair\r\ndoor, swinging out and in, with that. When it shuts, it runs them under\r\nthe other steps; when open, it brings them out to their proper place.\r\nIn the kitchen garden, are three pumps, worked by one horse. The pumps\r\nare placed in an equilateral triangle, each side of which is of about\r\nthirty-five feet. In the centre is a post, ten or twelve feet high,\r\nand one foot in diameter. In the top of this, enters the bent end of a\r\nlever, of about twelve or fifteen feet long, with a swingle tree at the\r\nother end. About three feet from the bent end, it receives on a pin,\r\nthree horizontal bars of iron, which at their other end lay hold of one\r\ncorner of a quadrantal crank (like a bell crank) moving in a vertical\r\nplane, to the other corner of which is hooked the vertical handle of the\r\npump. The crank turns on its point as a centre, by a pin or pivot passing\r\nthrough it. The horse moving the lever horizontally in a circle, every\r\npoint of the lever describes a horizontal circle. That which receives\r\nthe three bars, describes a circle of six feet in diameter. It gives a\r\nstroke then of six feet to the handle of each pump, at each revolution.\r\n\r\n_Blois._ _Orleans._ June 9, 10. At Blois, the road leaves the river,\r\nand traverses the hills, which are mostly reddish, sometimes gray, good\r\nenough, in vines, corn, St. foin. From Orleans to the river Juines, at\r\nEstampes, it is a continued plain of corn, and St. foin, tolerably good,\r\nsometimes gray, sometimes red. From Estampes to Estrechy, the country\r\nis mountainous and rocky, resembling that of Fontainebleau. Quære. If\r\nit may not be the same vein?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [19] It is twenty American miles from Aix to Marseilles,\r\n     and they call it five leagues. Their league, then, is of\r\n     four American miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_A Tour to some of the Gardens of England._\r\n\r\n[Memoranda made on a tour to some of the gardens in England, described\r\nby Whateley in his book on gardening.] While his descriptions, in point\r\nof style, are models of perfect elegance and classical correctness, they\r\nare as remarkable for their exactness. I always walked over the gardens\r\nwith his book in my hand, examined with attention the particular spots\r\nhe described, found them so justly characterized by him as to be easily\r\nrecognized, and saw with wonder, that his fine imagination had never been\r\nable to seduce him from the truth. My inquiries were directed chiefly\r\nto such practical things as might enable me to estimate the expense of\r\nmaking and maintaining a garden in that style. My journey was in the\r\nmonths of March and April, 1786.\r\n\r\n_Chiswick._--Belongs to Duke of Devonshire. A garden about six acres;--the\r\noctagonal dome has an ill effect, both within and without: the garden\r\nshows still too much of art. An obelisk of very ill effect; another in\r\nthe middle of a pond useless.\r\n\r\n_Hampton-Court._--Old fashioned. Clipt yews grown wild.\r\n\r\n_Twickenham._--Pope's original garden, three and a half acres. Sir Wm.\r\nStanhope added one and a half acre. This is a long narrow slip, grass and\r\ntrees in the middle, walk all round. Now Sir Wellbore Ellis's. Obelisk\r\nat bottom of Pope's garden, as monument to his mother. Inscription, \"Ah!\r\nEditha, matrum optima, mulierum amantissima, Vale.\" The house about thirty\r\nyards from the Thames: the ground shelves gently to the water side; on\r\nthe back of the house passes the street, and beyond that the garden.\r\nThe grotto is under the street, and goes out level to the water. In the\r\ncentre of the garden a mound with a spiral walk round it. A rookery.\r\n\r\n_Esher-Place._--The house in a bottom near the river; on the other side\r\nthe ground rises pretty much. The road by which we come to the house forms\r\na dividing line in the middle of the front; on the right are heights,\r\nrising one beyond and above another, with clumps of trees; on the farthest\r\na temple. A hollow filled up with a clump of trees, the tallest in the\r\nbottom, so that the top is quite flat. On the left the ground descends.\r\nClumps of trees, the clumps on each hand balance finely--a most lovely\r\nmixture of concave and convex. The garden is of about forty-five acres,\r\nbesides the park which joins. Belongs to Lady Frances Pelham.\r\n\r\n_Claremont._--Lord Clive's. Nothing remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Paynshill._--Mr. Hopkins. Three hundred and twenty-three acres, garden\r\nand park all in one. Well described by Whateley. Grotto said to have\r\ncost £7,000. Whateley says one of the bridges is of stone, but both now\r\nare of wood, the lower sixty feet high: there is too much evergreen. The\r\ndwelling-house built by Hopkins, ill-situated: he has not been there in\r\nfive years. He lived there four years while building the present house. It\r\nis not finished; its architecture is incorrect. A Doric temple, beautiful.\r\n\r\n_Woburn._--Belongs to Lord Peters. Lord Loughborough is the present tenant\r\nfor two lives. Four people to the farm, four to the pleasure garden, four\r\nto the kitchen garden. All are intermixed, the pleasure garden being\r\nmerely a highly-ornamented walk through and round the divisions of the\r\nfarm and kitchen garden.\r\n\r\n_Caversham._--Sold by Lord Cadogan to Major Marsac. Twenty-five acres of\r\ngarden, four hundred acres of park, six acres of kitchen garden. A large\r\nlawn, separated by a sunk fence from the garden, appears to be part of\r\nit. A straight, broad gravel walk passes before the front and parallel\r\nto it, terminated on the right by a Doric temple, and opening at the\r\nother end on a fine prospect. This straight walk has an ill effect. The\r\nlawn in front, which is pasture, well disposed with clumps of trees.\r\n\r\n_Wotton._--Now belongs to the Marquis of Buckingham, son of George\r\nGrenville. The lake covers fifty acres, the river five acres, the basin\r\nfifteen acres, the little river two acres--equal to seventy-two acres\r\nof water. The lake and great river are on a level, they fall into the\r\nbasin five feet below, and that again into the little river five feet\r\nlower. These waters lie in form of an [Illustration]: the house is in\r\nmiddle of open side, fronting the angle. A walk goes round the whole,\r\nthree miles in circumference, and containing within it about three\r\nhundred acres: sometimes it passes close to the water, sometimes so far\r\noff as to leave large pasture grounds between it and the water. But two\r\nhands to keep the pleasure grounds in order; much neglected. The water\r\naffords two thousand brace of carp a year. There is a Palladian bridge,\r\nof which, I think, Whateley does not speak.\r\n\r\n_Stowe._--Belongs to the Marquis of Buckingham, son of George Grenville,\r\nand who takes it from Lord Temple. Fifteen men and eighteen boys employed\r\nin keeping pleasure grounds. Within the walk are considerable portions\r\nseparated by inclosures and used for pasture. The Egyptian pyramid is\r\nalmost entirely taken down by the late Lord Temple, to erect a building\r\nthere, in commemoration of Mr. Pitt, but he died before beginning it,\r\nand nothing is done to it yet. The grotto and two rotundas are taken\r\naway. There are four levels of water, receiving it one from the other.\r\nThe basin contains seven acres, the lake below that ten acres. Kent's\r\nbuilding is called the temple of Venus. The inclosure is entirely by\r\nha-ha. At each end of the front line there is a recess like the bastion\r\nof a fort. In one of these is the temple of Friendship, in the other\r\nthe temple of Venus. They are seen the one from the other, the line of\r\nsight passing, not through the garden, but through the country parallel\r\nto the line of the garden. This has a good effect. In the approach to\r\nStowe, you are brought a mile through a straight avenue, pointing to the\r\nCorinthian arch and to the house, till you get to the arch, then you turn\r\nshort to the right. The straight approach is very ill. The Corinthian\r\narch has a very useless appearance, inasmuch as it has no pretension\r\nto any destination. Instead of being an object from the house, it is an\r\nobstacle to a very pleasing distant prospect. The Grecian valley being\r\nclear of trees, while the hill on each side is covered with them, is\r\nmuch deepened to appearance.\r\n\r\n_Leasowes, in Shropshire._--Now the property of Mr. Horne by purchase.\r\nOne hundred and fifty acres within the walk. The waters small. This is\r\nnot even an ornamented farm--it is only a grazing farm with a path round\r\nit, here and there a seat of board, rarely anything better. Architecture\r\nhas contributed nothing. The obelisk is of brick. Shenstone had but three\r\nhundred pounds a year, and ruined himself by what he did to this farm.\r\nIt is said that he died of the heart-aches which his debts occasioned\r\nhim. The part next the road is of red earth, that on the further part\r\ngray. The first and second cascades are beautiful. The landscape at\r\nnumber eighteen, and prospect at thirty-two, are fine. The walk through\r\nthe wood is umbrageous and pleasing. The whole arch of prospect may be\r\nof ninety degrees. Many of the inscriptions are lost.\r\n\r\n_Hagley, now Lord Wescot's._--One thousand acres: no distinction between\r\npark and garden--both blended, but more of the character of garden. Eight\r\nor nine laborers keep it in order. Between two and three hundred deer\r\nin it, some few of them red deer. They breed sometimes with the fallow.\r\nThis garden occupying a descending hollow between the Clent and Witchbury\r\nhills, with the spurs from those hills, there is no level in it for a\r\nspacious water. There are, therefore, only some small ponds. From one\r\nof these there is a fine cascade; but it can only be occasionally, by\r\nopening the sluice. This is in a small, dark, deep hollow, with recesses\r\nof stone in the banks on every side. In one of these is a Venus predique,\r\nturned half round as if inviting you with her into the recess. There\r\nis another cascade seen from the portico on the bridge. The castle is\r\ntriangular, with a round tower at each angle, one only entire; it seems\r\nto be between forty and fifty feet high. The ponds yield a great deal\r\nof trout. The walks are scarcely gravelled.\r\n\r\n_Blenheim._--Twenty-five hundred acres, of which two hundred is garden,\r\none hundred and fifty water, twelve kitchen garden, and the rest park.\r\nTwo hundred people employed to keep it in order, and to make alterations\r\nand additions. About fifty of these employed in pleasure grounds. The\r\nturf is mowed once in ten days. In summer, about two thousand fallow\r\ndeer in the park, and two or three thousand sheep. The palace of Henry\r\nII. was remaining till taken down by Sarah, widow of the first Duke of\r\nMarlborough. It was on a round spot levelled by art, near what is now\r\nwater, and but a little above it. The island was a part of the high road\r\nleading to the palace. Rosamond's bower was near where is now a little\r\ngrove, about two hundred yards from the palace. The well is near where\r\nthe bower was. The water here is very beautiful, and very grand. The\r\ncascade from the lake, a fine one; except this the garden has no great\r\nbeauties. It is not laid out in fine lawns and woods, but the trees\r\nare scattered thinly over the ground, and every here and there small\r\nthickets of shrubs, in oval raised beds, cultivated, and flowers among\r\nthe shrubs. The gravelled walks are broad--art appears too much. There\r\nare but a few seats in it, and nothing of architecture more dignified.\r\nThere is no one striking position in it. There has been a great addition\r\nto the length of the river since Whateley wrote.\r\n\r\n_Enfield Chase._--One of the four lodges. Garden about sixty acres.\r\nOriginally by Lord Chatham, now in the tenure of Dr. Beaver, who married\r\nthe daughter of Mr. Sharpe. The lease lately renewed--not in good repair.\r\nThe water very fine; would admit of great improvement by extending walks,\r\n&c., to the principal water at the bottom of the lawn.\r\n\r\n_Moor Park._--The lawn about thirty acres. A piece of ground up the\r\nhill of six acres. A small lake. Clumps of spruce firs. Surrounded by\r\nwalk--separately inclosed--destroys unity. The property of Mr. Rous, who\r\nbought of Sir Thomas Dundas. The building superb; the principal front a\r\nCorinthian portico of four columns; in front of the wings a colonnade,\r\nIonic, subordinate. Back front a terrace, four Corinthian pilasters.\r\nPulling down wings of building; removing deer; wants water.\r\n\r\n_Kew._--Archimedes' screw for raising water. A horizontal shaft made to\r\nturn the oblique one of the screw by a patent machinery of this form:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _The pieces separate._]\r\n\r\nA is driven by its shank into the horizontal axis of the wheel which\r\nturns the machine.\r\n\r\nB is an intermediate iron to connect the motion of A and C.\r\n\r\nC is driven by its shank into the axis of the screw.\r\n\r\nD is a cross axis, the ends, _a_ and _b_, going into the corresponding\r\nholes _a_ and _b_ of the iron A, and the ends, _c_ and _d_, going into\r\nthe corresponding holes _c_ and _d_ of the iron B.\r\n\r\nE is another cross axis, the ends, _e_ and _f_, going into the\r\ncorresponding holes _e_ and _f_ of the iron B, and the ends, _g_ and\r\n_h_, going into the corresponding holes _g_ and _h_ of the iron C.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Memorandums on a Tour from Paris to Amsterdam, Strasburg, and back to\r\nParis._--March 3d, 1788.\r\n\r\n_Amsterdam._--Joists of houses placed, not with their sides horizontally\r\nand perpendicularly, but diamond wise, thus: [Illustration] first, for\r\ngreater strength; second, to arch between with brick, thus: [Illustration]\r\nWindows opening so that they admit air and not rain. The upper\r\nsash opens on a horizontal axis, or pins in the centre of the sides,\r\nthe lower sash slides up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Windows._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nManner of fixing a flag staff on the mast of a vessel: _a_ is the bolt\r\non which it turns; _b_ a bolt which is taken in and out to fasten it\r\nor to let it down. When taken out, the lower end of the staff is shoved\r\nout of its case, and the upper end being heaviest brings itself down: a\r\nrope must have been previously fastened to the butt end, to pull it down\r\nagain when you want to raise the flag end.[Illustration] Dining tables\r\nletting down with single or double leaves, so as to take the room of their\r\nthickness only with a single leaf when open, thus: [Illustration]\r\nor thus:[Illustration] double-leaves open: [Illustration] shut,\r\nthus: [Illustration] or thus: [Illustration] shut: [Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeat costs about one doit each, or twelve and a half stivers the hundred.\r\nOne hundred make seven cubic feet, and to keep a tolerably comfortable\r\nfire for a study or chamber, takes about six every hour and a half.\r\n\r\nA machine for drawing light _empty_ boats over a dam at Amsterdam. It\r\nis an axis in peritrochio fixed on the dam. From the dam each way is\r\na sloping stage, the boat is presented to this, the rope of the axis\r\nmade fast to it, and it is drawn up. The water on one side of the dam\r\nis about four feet higher than on the other.\r\n\r\nThe camels used for lightening ships over the Pampus will raise the\r\nships eight feet. There are beams passing through the ship's sides,\r\nprojecting to the off side of the camel and resting on it; of course\r\nthat alone would keep the camel close to the ship. Besides this, there\r\nare a great number of windlasses on the camels, the ropes of which are\r\nmade fast to the gunwale of the ship. The camel is shaped to the ship\r\non the near side, and straight on the off one. When placed along side,\r\nwater is let into it so as nearly to sink it; in this state it receives\r\nthe beams, &c., of the ship, and then the water is pumped out.\r\n\r\nWind saw mills. See the plans detailed in the moolen book which I bought.\r\nA circular foundation of brick is raised about three or four feet high,\r\nand covered with a curb or sill of wood, and has little rollers under its\r\nsill which make it turn easily on the curb. A hanging bridge projects at\r\neach end about fifteen or twenty feet beyond the circular area, thus:\r\n[Illustration] horizontally, and thus: [Illustration] in the\r\nprofile to increase the play of the timbers on the frame. The wings are\r\nat one side, as at _a_; there is a shelter over the hanging bridges,\r\nbut of plank with scarce any frame, very light.\r\n\r\nA bridge across a canal formed by two scows, which open each to the\r\nopposite shore and let boats pass.\r\n\r\nA lanthern over the street door, which gives light equally into the\r\nantechamber and the street. It is a hexagon, and occupies the place of\r\nthe middle pane of glass in the circular top of the street door.\r\n\r\nA bridge on a canal, turning on a swivel, by which means it is arranged\r\nalong the side of the canal so as not to be in the way of boats when\r\nnot in use. When used, it is turned across the canal. It is, of course,\r\na little more than double the width of the canal.\r\n\r\nHedges of beach, which, not losing the old leaf till the new bud pushes\r\nit off, has the effect of an evergreen as to cover.\r\n\r\nMr. Ameshoff, merchant at Amsterdam. The distribution of his aviary is\r\nworthy of notice. Each kind of the large birds has its coop eight feet\r\nwide and four feet deep; the middle of the front is occupied by a broad\r\nglass window, on one side of which is a door for the keeper to enter at,\r\nand on the other a little trap-door for the birds to pass in and out.\r\nThe floor strewed with clean hay. Before each coop is a court of eight by\r\nsixteen feet, with wire in front and netting above, if the fowls be able\r\nto fly. For such as require it, there are bushes of evergreen growing in\r\ntheir court for them to lay their eggs under. The coops are frequently\r\ndivided into two stories: the upper for those birds which perch, such as\r\npigeons, &c., the lower for those which feed on the ground, as pheasants,\r\npartridges, &c. The court is in common for both stories, because the\r\nbirds do no injury to each other. For the water-fowl there is a pond of\r\nwater passing through the courts, with a movable separation. While they\r\nare breeding they must be separate, afterwards they may come together.\r\nThe small birds are some of them in a common aviary, and some in cages.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch wheel-barrow is in this form: [Illustration] which is very\r\nconvenient for loading and unloading.\r\n\r\nMr. Hermen Hend Damen, merchant-broker of Amsterdam, tells me that the\r\nemigrants to America come from the Palatinate down the Rhine, and take\r\nshipping from Amsterdam. Their passage is ten guineas if paid here, and\r\neleven if paid in America. He says they might be had in any number to\r\ngo to America, and settle lands as tenants on half stocks or metairies.\r\nPerhaps they would serve their employer one year as an indemnification\r\nfor the passage, and then be bound to remain on his lands seven years.\r\nThey would come to Amsterdam at their own expense. He thinks they would\r\nemploy more than fifty acres each; but _quære_, especially if they have\r\nfifty acres for their wife also?\r\n\r\n_Hodson._--The best house. Stadhonderian, his son, in the government.\r\nFriendly, but old and very infirm.\r\n\r\n_Hope._--The first house in Amsterdam. His first object England; but\r\nit is supposed he would like to have the American business also, yet he\r\nwould probably make our affairs subordinate to those of England.\r\n\r\n_Vollenhoven._--An excellent old house; connected with no party.\r\n\r\n_Sapportus._--A brother, very honest and ingenuous, well-disposed; acts\r\nfor Hope, but will say with truth what he can do for us. The best person\r\nto consult with as to the best house to undertake a piece of business. He\r\nhas brothers in London in business. Jacob Van Staphorst tells me there\r\nare about fourteen millions of florins, new money, placed in loans in\r\nHolland every year, being the savings of individuals out of their annual\r\nrevenue, &c. Besides this, there are every year reimbursements of old\r\nloans from some quarter or other to be replaced at interest in some new\r\nloan.\r\n\r\n1788. March 16th. Baron Steuben has been generally suspected of having\r\nsuggested the first idea of the self-styled Order of Cincinnati. But Mr.\r\nAdams tells me, that in the year 1776 he had called at a tavern in the\r\nState of New York to dine, just at the moment when the British army was\r\nlanding at Frog's Neck. Generals Washington, Lee, Knox and Parsons, came\r\nto the same tavern. He got into conversation with Knox. They talked of\r\nancient history--of Fabius, who used to raise the Romans from the dust;\r\nof the present contest, &c.; and General Knox, in the course of the\r\nconversation, said he should wish for some ribbon to wear in his hat,\r\nor in his button hole, to be transmitted to his descendants as a badge\r\nand a proof that he had fought in defence of their liberties. He spoke\r\nof it in such precise terms, as showed he had revolved it in his mind\r\nbefore. Mr. Adams says he and Knox were standing together in the door of\r\nthe tavern, and does not recollect whether General Washington and the\r\nothers were near enough to hear the conversation, or were even in the\r\nroom at that moment. Baron Steuben did not arrive in America till above\r\na year after that. Mr. Adams is now fifty-three years old, _i. e._ nine\r\nyears more than I am.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOPE'S HOUSE, NEAR HARLAEM.]\r\n\r\nIt is said this house will cost four tons of silver, or forty thousand\r\npounds sterling. The separation between the middle building and wings\r\nin the upper story has a capricious appearance, yet a pleasing one. The\r\nright wing of the house (which is the left in the plan) extends back to\r\na great length, so as to make the ground plan in the form of an L. The\r\nparapet has a pannel of wall, and a pannel of ballusters alternately,\r\nwhich lighten it. There is no portico, the columns being backed against\r\nthe wall of the front.\r\n\r\nMarch 30th, 31st. _Amsterdam._ _Utrecht._ _Nimeguen._ The lower parts\r\nof the low countries seem partly to have been gained from the sea, and\r\npartly to be made up of the plains of the Yssel, the Rhine, the Maese\r\nand the Schelde united. To Utrecht nothing but plains are seen, a rich\r\nblack mould, wet, lower than the level of the waters which intersect\r\nit; almost entirely in grass; few or no farm-houses, as the business of\r\ngrazing requires few laborers. The canal is lined with country houses,\r\nwhich bespeak the wealth and cleanliness of the country; but generally\r\nin an uncouth state, and exhibiting no regular architecture. After\r\npassing Utrecht, the hills north-east of the Rhine come into view, and\r\ngather in towards the river, till at Wyck Dursted they are within three\r\nor four miles, and at Amelengen they join the river. The plains, after\r\npassing Utrecht, become more sandy; the hills are very poor and sandy,\r\ngenerally waste in broom, sometimes a little corn. The plains are in\r\ncorn, grass, and willow. The plantations of the latter are immense, and\r\ngive it the air of an uncultivated country. There are now few châteaux;\r\nfarm-houses abound, built generally of brick, and covered with tile or\r\nthatch. There are some apple-trees, but no forest; a few inclosures of\r\nwillow wattling. In the gardens are hedges of beach, one foot apart,\r\nwhich, not losing its old leaves till they are pushed off in the spring\r\nby the young ones, gives the shelter of evergreens. The Rhine is here\r\nabout three hundred yards wide, and the road to Nimeguen passing it a\r\nlittle below Wattelingen, leaves Hetern in sight on the left. On this\r\nside, the plains of the Rhine, the Ling, and the Waal unite. The Rhine\r\nand Waal are crossed on vibrating boats, the rope supported by a line of\r\nseven little barks. The platform by which you go on to the ferry-boat\r\nis supported by boats. The view from the hill at Cress is sublime. It\r\ncommands the Waal, and extends far up the Rhine. That also up and down\r\nthe Waal from the Bellevue of Nimeguen, is very fine. The château here\r\nis pretended to have lodged Julius Cæsar. This is giving it an antiquity\r\nof at least eighteen centuries, which must be apocryphal. Some few sheep\r\nto-day, which were feeding in turnip patches.\r\n\r\nApril 1st. _Cranenburg._ _Cleves._ _Santen._ _Reynberg._ _Hoogstraat._\r\nThe transition from ease and opulence to extreme poverty is remarkable\r\non crossing the line between the Dutch and Prussian territories. The\r\nsoil and climate are the same; the governments alone differ. With the\r\npoverty, the fear also of slaves is visible in the faces of the Prussian\r\nsubjects. There is an improvement, however, in the physiognomy, especially\r\ncould it be a little brightened up. The road leads generally over the\r\nhills, but sometimes through skirts of the plains of the Rhine. These\r\nare always extensive and good. They want manure, being visibly worn\r\ndown. The hills are almost always sandy, barren, uncultivated, and\r\ninsusceptible of culture, covered with broom and moss; here and there\r\na little indifferent forest, which is sometimes of beach. The plains\r\nare principally in corn; some grass and willow. There are no châteaux,\r\nnor houses that bespeak the existence even of a middle class. Universal\r\nand equal poverty overspreads the whole. In the villages, too, which\r\nseem to be falling down, the over-proportion of women is evident. The\r\ncultivators seem to live on their farms. The farm-houses are of mud,\r\nthe better sort of brick; all covered over with thatch. Cleves is little\r\nmore than a village. If there are shops or magazines of merchandise in\r\nit, they show little. Here and there at a window some small articles\r\nare hung up within the glass. The goose-berry beginning to leaf.\r\n\r\nApril 2d. Passed the Rhine at _Essenberg_. It is there about a quarter of\r\na mile wide, or five hundred yards. It is crossed in a scow with sails.\r\nThe wind being on the quarter, we were eight or ten minutes only in the\r\npassage. Duysberg is but a village in fact, walled in; the buildings\r\nmostly of brick. No new ones, which indicate a thriving state. I had\r\nunderstood that near that were remains of the encampment of Varus, in\r\nwhich he and his legions fell by the arms of Arminius (in the time of\r\nTiberius I think it was), but there was not a person to be found in\r\nDuysberg who could understand either English, French, Italian, or Latin.\r\nSo I could make no inquiry.\r\n\r\nFrom _Duysberg_ to _Dusseldorf_ the road leads sometimes over the hills,\r\nsometimes through the plains of the Rhine, the quality of which are as\r\nbefore described. On the hills, however, are considerable groves of oak,\r\nof spontaneous growth, which seem to be of more than a century; but the\r\nsoil being barren, the trees, though high, are crooked and knotty. The\r\nundergrowth is broom and moss. In the plains is corn entirely. As they\r\nare become rather sandy for grass, there are no inclosures on the Rhine\r\nat all. The houses are poor and ruinous, mostly of brick, and scantling\r\nmixed. A good deal of grape cultivated.\r\n\r\n_Dusseldorf._ The gallery of paintings is sublime, particularly the\r\nroom of Vanderwerff. The plains from Dusseldorf to Cologne are much more\r\nextensive, and go off in barren downs at some distance from the river.\r\nThese downs extend far, according to appearance. They are manuring the\r\nplains with lime. A gate at the Elector's château on this road in this\r\nform. We cross at Cologne on a pendulum boat. I observe the hog of this\r\ncountry (Westphalia), of which the celebrated ham is made, is tall,\r\ngaunt, and with heavy lop ears. Fatted at a year old, would weigh one\r\nhundred or one hundred and twenty pounds. At two years old, two hundred\r\npounds. Their principal food is acorns. The pork, fresh, sells at two\r\nand a half pence sterling the pound. The hams, ready made, at eight\r\nand a half pence sterling the pound. One hundred and six pounds of this\r\ncountry is equal to one hundred pounds of Holland. About four pounds of\r\nfine Holland salt is put on one hundred pounds of pork. It is smoked in\r\na room which has no chimney. Well-informed people here tell me there is\r\nno other part of the world where the bacon is smoked. They do not know\r\nthat we do it. Cologne is the principal market of exportation. They find\r\nthat the small hog makes the sweetest meat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Cologne_ is a sovereign city, having no territory out of its walls. It\r\ncontains about sixty thousand inhabitants; appears to have much commerce,\r\nand to abound with poor. Its commerce is principally in the hands of\r\nProtestants, of whom there are about sixty houses in the city. They are\r\nextremely restricted in their operations, and otherwise oppressed in every\r\nform by the government, which is Catholic, and excessively intolerant.\r\nTheir Senate, some time ago, by a majority of twenty-two to eighteen,\r\nallowed them to have a church; but it is believed this privilege will\r\nbe revoked. There are about two hundred and fifty Catholic churches in\r\nthe city. The Rhine is here about four hundred yards wide. This city\r\nis in 51° latitude, wanting about 6´. Here the vines begin, and it is\r\nthe most northern spot on the earth on which wine is made. Their first\r\ngrapes came from Orleans, since that from Alsace, Champagne, &c. It is\r\nthirty-two years only since the first vines were sent from Cassel, near\r\nMayence, to the Cape of Good Hope, of which the Cape wine is now made.\r\nAfterwards new supplies were sent from the same quarter. That I suppose\r\nis the most southern spot on the globe where wine is made, and it is\r\nsingular that the same vine should have furnished two wines as much\r\nopposed to each other in quality as in situation. I was addressed here\r\nby Mr. Damen, of Amsterdam, to Mr. Jean Jaques Peuchen, of this place,\r\nMerchant.\r\n\r\nApril 4th. _Cologne._ _Bonne._ _Andernach._ _Coblentz._ I saw many\r\nwalnut trees to-day in the open fields. It would seem as if this tree\r\nand wine required the same climate. The soil begins now to be reddish,\r\nboth on the hills and in the plains. Those from Cologne to Bonne extend\r\nabout three miles from the river on each side; but a little above Bonne\r\nthey become contracted, and continue from thence to be from one mile to\r\nnothing, comprehending both sides of the river. They are in corn, some\r\nclover and rape, and many vines. These are planted in rows three feet\r\napart both ways. The vine is left about six or eight feet high, and\r\nstuck with poles ten or twelve feet high. To these poles they are tied\r\nin two places, at the height of about two and four feet. They are now\r\nperforming this operation. The hills are generally excessively steep, a\r\ngreat proportion of them barren; the rest in vines principally, sometimes\r\nsmall patches of corn. In the plains, though rich, I observed they dung\r\ntheir vines plentifully; and it is observed here, as elsewhere, that the\r\nplains yield much wine, but bad. The good is furnished from the hills.\r\nThe walnut, willow, and apple tree beginning to leaf.\r\n\r\n_Andernach_ is the port on the Rhine to which the famous mill-stones of\r\nCologne are brought; the quarry, as some say, being at Mendich, three\r\nor four leagues from thence. I suppose they have been called Cologne\r\nmill-stones, because the merchants of that place having the most extensive\r\ncorrespondence, have usually sent them to all parts of the world. I\r\nobserved great collections of them at Cologne. This is one account.\r\n\r\nApril 5. _Coblentz._ _Nassau._ Another account is, that these stones\r\nare cut at Triers and brought down the Moselle. I could not learn the\r\nprice of them at the quarry; but I was shown a grind-stone of the same\r\nstone, five feet diameter, which cost at Triers six florins. It was of\r\nbut half the thickness of a mill-stone. I supposed, therefore, that two\r\nmill-stones would cost about as much as three of these grind-stones,\r\n_i. e._ about a guinea and a half. This country abounds with slate.\r\n\r\nThe best Moselle wines are made about fifteen leagues from hence, in\r\nan excessively mountainous country. The first quality (without any\r\ncomparison) is that made on the mountain of Brownberg, adjoining to the\r\nvillage of Dusmond; and the best crops is that of the Baron Breidbach\r\nBurrhesheim, grand chambellan et grand Baillif de Coblentz. His Receveur,\r\nof the name of Mayer, lives at Dusmond. The last fine year was 1783, which\r\nsells now at fifty louis the foudre, which contains six aumes of one\r\nhundred and seventy bottles each, equal about one thousand one hundred\r\nand ten bottles. This is about twenty-two sous Tournois the bottle. In\r\ngeneral, the Baron Burrhesheim's crops will sell as soon as made, say at\r\nthe vintage, for one hundred and thirty, one hundred and forty, and one\r\nhundred and fifty ecus the foudre (the ecu is one and a half florin of\r\nHolland), say two hundred. 2. Vialen is the second quality, and sells\r\nnew at one hundred and twenty ecus the foudre. 3. Crach-Bispost is the\r\nthird, and sells for about one hundred and five ecus. I compared Crach\r\nof 1783 with Baron Burrhesheim's of the same year. The latter is quite\r\nclear of acid, stronger, and very sensibly the best. 4. Selting, which\r\nsells at one hundred ecus. 5. Kous-Berncastle, the fifth quality, sells\r\nat eighty or ninety. After this there is a gradation of qualities down\r\nto thirty ecus. These wines must be five or six years old before they\r\nare quite ripe for drinking. One thousand plants yield a foudre of wine\r\na year in the most plentiful vineyards. In other vineyards, it will take\r\ntwo thousand or two thousand and five hundred plants to yield a foudre.\r\nThe culture of one thousand plants costs about one louis a year. A day's\r\nlabor of a man is paid in winter twenty kreitzers (_i. e._ one-third of\r\na florin), in summer twenty-six; a woman's is half that. The red wines\r\nof this country are very indifferent, and will not keep. The Moselle is\r\nhere from one hundred to two hundred yards wide; the Rhine three hundred\r\nto four hundred. A jessamine in the Count de Moustier's garden in leaf.\r\n\r\nIn the Elector of Treves' palace at _Coblentz_, are large rooms very\r\nwell warmed by warm air conveyed from an oven below, through tubes which\r\nopen into the rooms. An oil and vinegar cruet in this form: [Illustration]\r\nAt Coblentz we pass the river on a pendulum boat, and the road to Nassau\r\nis over tremendous hills, on which is here and there a little corn, more\r\nvines, but mostly barren. In some of these barrens are forests of beach\r\nand oak, tolerably large, but crooked and knotty; the undergrowth beach\r\nbrush, broom, and moss. The soil of the plains, and of the hills where\r\nthey are cultivable, is reddish. Nassau is a village the whole rents of\r\nwhich should not amount to more than a hundred or two guineas. Yet it\r\ngives the title of Prince to the house of Orange to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nApril 6th. _Nassau._ _Schwelbach._ _Wisbaden._ _Hocheim._ _Frankfort._\r\nThe road from Nassau to Schwelbach is over hills, or rather mountains,\r\nboth high and steep; always poor, and above half of them barren in beach\r\nand oak. At Schwelbach there is some chesnut. The other parts are either\r\nin winter grain, or preparing for that of the spring. Between Schwelbach\r\nand Wisbaden we come in sight of the plains of the Rhine, which are very\r\nextensive. From hence the lands, both high and low, are very fine, in\r\ncorn, vines, and fruit trees. The country has the appearance of wealth,\r\nespecially in the approach to Frankfort.\r\n\r\nApril 7th. _Frankfort._ Among the poultry, I have seen no turkies in\r\nGermany till I arrive at this place. The Stork, or Crane, is very commonly\r\ntame here. It is a miserable, dirty, ill-looking bird. The Lutheran is\r\nthe reigning religion here, and is equally intolerant to the Catholic\r\nand Calvinist, excluding them from the free corps.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nApril 8th. _Frankfort._ _Hanau._ The road goes through the plains of the\r\nMaine, which are mulatto, and very fine. They are well cultivated till\r\nyou pass the line between the republic and the landgraviate of Hesse,\r\nwhen you immediately see the effect of the difference of government,\r\nnotwithstanding the tendency which the neighborhood of such a commercial\r\ntown as Frankfort has to counteract the effects of tyranny in its\r\nvicinities, and to animate them in spite of oppression. In Frankfort\r\nall is life, bustle, and motion; in Hanau the silence and quiet of the\r\nmansions of the dead. Nobody is seen moving in the streets; every door\r\nis shut; no sound of the saw, the hammer, or other utensil of industry.\r\nThe drum and fife is all that is heard. The streets are cleaner than a\r\nGerman floor, because nobody passes them. At Williamsbath, near Hanau,\r\nis a country seat of the Landgrave. There is a ruin which is clever.\r\nIt presents the remains of an old castle. The ground plan is in this\r\nform: [Illustration] The upper story in this: [Illustration] A circular\r\nroom of thirty-one and a half feet diameter within. The four little square\r\ntowers at the corners finish at the floor of the upper story, so as to\r\nbe only platforms to walk out on. Over the circular room is a platform\r\nalso, which is covered by the broken parapet which once crowned the top,\r\nbut is now fallen off some parts, whilst the other parts remain. I like\r\nbetter, however, the form of the ruin at Hagley, in England, which was\r\nthus a centry box here, covered over with bark, so as to look exactly\r\nlike the trunk of an old tree. This is a good idea; and may be of much\r\navail in a garden. There is a hermitage in which is a good figure of\r\na hermit in plaster, colored to the life, with a table and book before\r\nhim, in the attitude of reading and contemplation. In a little cell is\r\nhis bed; in another his books, some tools, &c.; in another his little\r\nprovision of firewood, &c. There is a monument erected to the son of\r\nthe present landgrave, in the form of a pyramid, the base of which is\r\neighteen and a half feet. The side declines from the perpendicular about\r\ntwenty-one and a half degrees. An arch is carried through it both ways so\r\nas present a door in each side. In the middle of this, at the crossing\r\nof the two arches, is a marble monument with this inscription: \"ante\r\ntempus.\" He died at twelve years of age. Between Hanau and Frankfort, in\r\nsight of the road, is the village of Bergen, where was fought the battle\r\nof Bergen in the war before last. Things worth noting here are: 1. A\r\nfolding ladder. 2. Manner of packing china cups and saucers, the former\r\nin a circle within the latter. 3. The marks of different manufactures\r\nof china, to wit: Dresden with two swords. Hecks with a wheel with\r\n[Illustration], Frankendaal with [Illustration] (for Charles Theodore),\r\nand a [Illustration] over it. Berlin with 4. The top rail of a wagon\r\nsupported by the washers on the ends of the axle-trees.\r\n\r\nApril 10th. _Frankfort._ _Hocheim._ _Mayence._ The little tyrants round\r\nabout having disarmed their people, and made it very criminal to kill\r\ngame, one knows when they quit the territory of Frankfort by the quantity\r\nof game which is seen. In the Republic, everybody being allowed to be\r\narmed, and to hunt on their own lands, there is very little game left\r\nin its territory. The hog hereabouts resembles extremely the little hog\r\nof Virginia. Round like that, a small head, and short upright ears. This\r\nmakes the ham of Mayence so much esteemed at Paris.\r\n\r\nWe cross the Rhine at Mayence on a bridge one thousand eight hundred and\r\nforty feet long, supported by forty-seven boats. It is not in a direct\r\nline, but curved up against the stream; which may strengthen it if the\r\ndifference between the upper and lower curve be sensible, if the planks\r\nof the floor be thick, well jointed together, and forming sectors of\r\ncircles, so as to act on the whole as the stones of an arch. But it has\r\nby no means this appearance. Near one end, one of the boats has an axis\r\nin peritrochio, and a chain, by which it may be let drop down stream\r\nsome distance, with the portion of the floor belonging to it, so as\r\nto let a vessel through. Then it is wound up again into place, and to\r\nconsolidate it the more with the adjoining parts, the loose section is\r\na little higher, and has at each end a folding stage, which folds back\r\non it when it moves down, and when brought up again into place, these\r\nstages are folded over on the bridge. This whole operation takes but\r\nfour or five minutes. In the winter the bridge is taken away entirely,\r\non account of the ice. And then everything passes on the ice through\r\nthe whole winter.\r\n\r\nApril 11th. _Mayence._ _Rudesheim._ _Johansberg._ _Markebronn._ The women\r\ndo everything here. They dig the earth, plough, saw, cut and split wood,\r\nrow, tow the batteaux, &c. In a small but dull kind of batteau, with two\r\nhands rowing with a kind of large paddle, and a square sail, but scarcely\r\na breath of wind, we went down the river at the rate of five miles an\r\nhour, making it three and a half hours to Rudesheim. The floats of wood\r\nwhich go with the current only, go one mile and a half an hour. They\r\ngo night and day. There are five boat-mills abreast here. Their floats\r\nseem to be about eight feet broad. The Rhine yields salmon, carp, pike,\r\nand perch, and the little rivers running into it yield speckled trout.\r\nThe plains from Maintz to Rudesheim are good and in corn; the hills\r\nmostly in vines. The banks of the river are so low that, standing up in\r\nthe batteau, I could generally see what was in the plains. Yet they are\r\nseldom overflowed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A TOWER AT RUDESHEIM.]\r\n\r\nThough they begin to make wine, as has been said, at Cologne, and continue\r\nit up the river indefinitely, yet it is only from Rudesheim to Hocheim\r\nthat wines of the very first quality are made. The river happens there to\r\nrun due east and west, so as to give its hills on that side a southern\r\naspect. And even in this canton, it is only Hocheim, Johansberg, and\r\nRudesheim, that are considered as of the very first quality. Johansberg\r\nis a little mountain (berg signifies mountain), whereon is a religious\r\nhouse, about fifteen miles below Mayence, and near the village of Vingel.\r\nIt has a southern aspect, the soil a barren mulatto clay, mixed with a\r\ngood deal of stone, and some slate. This wine used to be but on a par\r\nwith Hocheim and Rudesheim; but the place having come to the Bishop of\r\nFulda, he improved its culture so as to render it stronger; and since\r\nthe year 1775, it sells at double the price of the other two. It has\r\nnone of the acid of the Hocheim and other Rhenish wines. There are about\r\nsixty tons made in a good year, which sell, as soon as of a drinkable\r\nage, at one thousand franks each. The tun here contains seven and a-half\r\naumes of one hundred and seventy bottles each. Rudesheim is a village of\r\nabout eighteen or twenty miles below Mayence. Its fine wines are made on\r\nthe hills about a mile below the village, which look to the south, and\r\non the middle and lower parts of them. They are terraced. The soil is\r\ngray, about one-half of slate and rotten stone, the other half of barren\r\nclay, excessively steep. Just behind the village also is a little spot,\r\ncalled Hinder House, belonging to the Counts of Sicken and Oschstein,\r\nwhereon each makes about a ton of wine of the very first quality. This\r\nspot extends from the bottom to the top of the hill. The vignerons of\r\nRudesheim dung their wines about once in five or six years, putting a\r\none-horse tumbrel load of dung on every twelve feet square. One thousand\r\nplants yield about four aumes in a good year. The best crops are,\r\n\r\n     The Chanoines of Mayence, who make          15 pieces of 7½ aumes.\r\n     Le Comte de Sicken                           6    \"             \"\r\n     Le Comte d'Oschstein                         9    \"             \"\r\n     L'Electeur de Mayence                        6    \"             \"\r\n     Le Comte de Meternisch                       6    \"             \"\r\n     Monsieur de Boze                             5    \"             \"\r\n     M.

The proprietors\r\nsell them old or young, according to the prices offered, and according\r\nto their own want of money. There is always a little difference between\r\ndifferent casks, and therefore when you choose and buy a single cask,\r\nyou pay three, four, five or six hundred florins for it. They are not\r\nat all acid, and to my taste much preferable to Hocheim, though but of\r\nthe same price. Hocheim is a village about three miles above Mayence,\r\non the Maine, where it empties into the Rhine. The spot whereon the\r\ngood wine is made is the hill side from the church down to the plain,\r\na gentle slope of about a quarter of a mile wide, and extending half a\r\nmile towards Mayence. It is of south-western aspect, very poor, sometimes\r\ngray, sometimes mulatto, with a moderate mixture of small broken stone.\r\nThe wines are planted three feet apart, and stuck with sticks about six\r\nfeet high. The wine, too, is cut at that height. They are dunged once in\r\nthree or four years. One thousand plants yield from one to two aumes a\r\nyear: they begin to yield a little at three years old, and continue to\r\none hundred years, unless sooner killed by a cold winter. Dick, keeper\r\nof the Rothen-house tavern at Frankfort, a great wine merchant, who has\r\nbetween three and four hundred tons of wine in his cellars, tells me\r\nthat Hocheim of the year 1783, sold, as soon as it was made, at ninety\r\nflorins the aume, Rudesheim of the same year, as soon as made, at one\r\nhundred and fifteen florins, and Markebronn seventy florins. But a peasant\r\nof Hocheim tells me that the best crops of Hocheim in the good years,\r\nwhen sold new, sell but for about thirty-two or thirty-three florins\r\nthe aume; but that it is only the poorer proprietors who sell new. The\r\nfine crops are,\r\n\r\n     Count Ingleheim about        10 tuns. }\r\n     Baron d'Alberg                8  \"    }   All of these keep till\r\n     Count Schimbon               14  \"    } about fifteen years old,\r\n     The Chanoines of Mayence     18  \"    } before they sell, unless\r\n     Counsellor Schik de Vetsler  15  \"    } they are offered a very\r\n     Convent of Jacobsberg         8  \"    } good price sooner.\r\n     The Chanoine of Fechbach     10  \"    }\r\n     The Carmelites of Frankfort   8  \"    {   Who only sell by the bottle\r\n                                           { in their own tavern in\r\n                                           { Frankfort.\r\n     The Bailiff of Hocheim       11  \"        Who sells at three or four\r\n                                             years old.\r\n     Zimmerman, a bourgeois        4  \"    }   These being poor, sell new.\r\n     Feldman, a carpenter          2  \"    }\r\n\r\nMarkebronn (bronn signifies a spring, and is probably of affinity with\r\nthe Scotch word, burn) is a little canton in the same range of hills,\r\nadjoining to the village of Hagenheim, about three miles above Johansberg,\r\nsubject to the elector of Mayence. It is a sloping hill side of southern\r\naspect, mulatto, poor, and mixed with some stone. This yields wine of\r\nthe second quality.\r\n\r\nApril 12th. _Mayence._ _Oppenheim._ _Dorms._ _Manheim._ On the road\r\nbetween Mayence and Oppenheim are three cantons, which are also esteemed\r\nas yielding wines of the second quality. These are Laudenheim, Bodenheim,\r\nand Nierstein. Laudenheim is a village about four or five miles from\r\nMayence. Its wines are made on a steep hill side, the soil of which\r\nis gray, poor and mixed with some stone. The river there happens to\r\nmake a short turn to the south-west, so as to present its hills to the\r\nsouth-east. Bodenheim is a village nine miles, and Nierstein another about\r\nten or eleven miles from Mayence. Here, too, the river is north-east and\r\nsouth-west, so as to give the hills between these villages a south-east\r\naspect; and at Thierstein, a valley making off, brings the face of the\r\nhill round to the south. The hills between these villages are almost\r\nperpendicular, of a vermilion red, very poor, and having as much rotten\r\nstone as earth. It is to be observed that these are the only cantons\r\non the south side of the river which yield good wine, the hills on this\r\nside being generally exposed to the cold winds, and turned from the sun.\r\nThe annexed bill of prices current, will give an idea of the estimation\r\nof these wines respectively.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the grapes in this country, there are three kinds in\r\nuse for making white wine, (for I take no notice of the red wines, as\r\nbeing absolutely worthless.) 1. The Klemperien, of which the inferior\r\nqualities of Rhenish wines are made, and is cultivated because of its\r\nhardness. The wines of this grape descend as low as one hundred florins\r\nthe tun of eight aumes. 2. The Rhysslin grape, which grows only from\r\nHocheim down to Rudesheim. This is small and delicate, and therefore\r\nsucceeds only in this chosen spot. Even at Rudesheim it yields a fine\r\nwine only in the little spot called Hinder House, before mentioned; the\r\nmass of good wines made at Rudesheim, below the village, being of the\r\nthird kind of grape, which is called the Orleans grape.\r\n\r\nTo Oppenheim the plains of the Rhine and Maine are united. From that\r\nplace we see the commencement of the Bergstrasse, or mountains which\r\nseparate at first the plains of the Rhine and Maine, then cross the\r\nNeckar at Heidelberg, and from thence forms the separation between the\r\nplains of the Neckar and Rhine, leaving those of the Rhine about ten or\r\ntwelve miles wide. These plains are sometimes black, sometimes mulatto,\r\nalways rich. They are in corn, potatoes, and some willow. On the other\r\nside again, that is, on the west side, the hills keep at first close to\r\nthe river. They are about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred feet\r\nhigh, sloping, red, good, and mostly in vines. Above Oppenheim, they\r\nbegin to go off till they join the mountains of Lorraine and Alsace,\r\nwhich separate the waters of the Moselle and Rhine, leaving to the whole\r\nvalley of the Rhine about twenty or twenty-five miles breadth. About\r\nWorms these plains are sandy, poor, and often covered only with small\r\npine.\r\n\r\nApril 13th. _Manheim._ There is a bridge over the Rhine here, supported\r\non thirty-nine boats, and one over the Neckar on eleven boats. The\r\nbridge over the Rhine is twenty-one and a half feet wide from rail to\r\nrail. The boats are four feet deep, fifty-two feet long, and nine feet\r\neight inches broad. The space between boat and boat is eighteen feet ten\r\ninches. From these data the length of the bridge should be 9ft. 8in. +\r\n18ft. 10in. × 40 = 1140 feet. In order to let vessels pass through, two\r\nboats well framed together, with their flooring, are made to fall down\r\nstream together. Here, too, they make good ham. It is fattened on round\r\npotatoes and Indian corn. The farmers smoke what is for their own use\r\nin their chimneys. When it is made for sale, and in greater quantities\r\nthan the chimney will hold, they make the smoke of the chimney pass into\r\nan adjoining loft, or apartment, from which it has no issue; and here\r\nthey hang their hams.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAn economical curtain bedstead. The bedstead is seven feet by four feet\r\ntwo inches. From each leg there goes up an iron rod three-eighths of an\r\ninch in diameter. Those from the legs at the foot of the bed meeting at\r\ntop as in the margin, and those from the head meeting in like manner, so\r\nthat the two at the foot form one point, and the two at the head another.\r\nOn these points lays an oval iron rod, whose long diameter is five feet,\r\nand short one three feet one inch. There is a hole through this rod at\r\neach end, by which it goes on firm on the point of the upright rods.\r\nThen a nut screws it down firmly. Ten breadths of stuff two feet ten\r\ninches wide, and eight feet six inches long, form the curtains. There\r\nis no top nor vallons. The rings are fastened within two and a half or\r\nthree inches of the top on the inside, which two and a half or three\r\ninches stand up, and are an ornament somewhat like a ruffle.\r\n\r\nI have observed all along the Rhine that they make the oxen draw by the\r\nhorns. A pair of very handsome chariot horses, large, bay, and seven years\r\nold, sell for fifty louis. One pound of beef sells for eight kreitzers,\r\n(_i. e._ eight sixtieths of a florin;) one pound of mutton or veal, six\r\nkreitzers; one pound of pork, seven and a half kreitzers; one pound of\r\nham, twelve kreitzers; one pound of fine wheat bread, two kreitzers;\r\none pound of butter, twenty kreitzers; one hundred and sixty pounds of\r\nwheat, six francs; one hundred and sixty pounds of maize, five francs; one\r\nhundred and sixty pounds of potatoes, one franc; one hundred pounds of\r\nhay, one franc; a cord of wood (which is 4 4 and 6 feet), seven francs;\r\na laborer by the day receives twenty-four kreitzers, and feeds himself.\r\nA journee or arpent of land (which is eight by two hundred steps), such\r\nas the middling plains of the Rhine, will sell for two hundred francs.\r\nThere are more soldiers here than other inhabitants, to wit: six thousand\r\nsoldiers and four thousand males of full age of the citizens, the whole\r\nnumber of whom is reckoned at twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nApril 14th. _Manheim._ _Dossenheim._ _Heidelberg._ _Schwetzingen Manheim._\r\nThe elector placed, in 1768, two males and five females of the Angora\r\ngoat at Dossenheim, which is at the foot of the Bergstrasse mountains.\r\nHe sold twenty-five last year, and has now seventy. They are removed\r\ninto the mountains four leagues beyond Dossenheim. Heidelberg is on the\r\nNeckar just where it issues from the Bergstrasse mountains, occupying\r\nthe first skirt of plain which it forms. The château is up the hill\r\na considerable height. The gardens lie above the château, climbing up\r\nthe mountain in terraces. This château is the most noble ruin I have\r\never seen, having been reduced to that state by the French in the time\r\nof Louis XIV., 1693. Nothing remains under cover but the chapel. The\r\nsituation is romantic and pleasing beyond expression. It is on a great\r\nscale much like the situation of Petrarch's château, at Vaucluse, on a\r\nsmall one. The climate, too, is like that of Italy. The apple, the pear,\r\ncherry, peach, apricot, and almond, are all in bloom. There is a station\r\nin the garden to which the château re-echoes distinctly four syllables.\r\nThe famous ton of Heidelberg was new built in 1751, and made to contain\r\nthirty foudres more than the ancient one. It is said to contain two\r\nhundred and thirty-six foudres of one thousand two hundred bottles each.\r\nI measured it, and found its length external to be twenty-eight feet ten\r\ninches; its diameter at the end twenty feet three inches; the thickness\r\nof the staves seven and a half inches; thickness of the hoops seven\r\nand a half inches; besides a great deal of external framing. There is\r\nno wine in it now. The gardens at Schwetzingen show how much money may\r\nbe laid out to make an ugly thing. What is called the English quarter,\r\nhowever, relieves the eye from the straight rows of trees, round and\r\nsquare basins, which constitute the great mass of the garden. There are\r\nsome tolerable morsels of Grecian architecture, and a good ruin. The\r\nAviary, too, is clever. It consists of cells of about eight feet wide,\r\narranged round, and looking into a circular area of about forty or fifty\r\nfeet diameter. The cells have doors both of wire and glass, and have\r\nsmall shrubs in them. The plains of the Rhine on this side are twelve\r\nmiles wide, bounded by the Bergstrasse mountains. These appear to be\r\neight hundred or a thousand feet high; the lower part in vines, from\r\nwhich is made what is called the vin de Nichar; the upper in chesnut.\r\nThere are some cultivated spots however, quite to the top. The plains\r\nare generally mulatto, in corn principally; they are planting potatoes\r\nin some parts, and leaving others open for maize and tobacco. Many peach\r\nand other fruit trees on the lower part of the mountain. The paths on\r\nsome parts of these mountains are somewhat in the style represented in\r\nthe margin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Manheim._ _Kaeferthal._ _Manheim._ Just beyond Kaeferthal is an\r\nextensive, sandy waste, planted in pine, in which the elector has about\r\ntwo hundred sangliers, tamed. I saw about fifty; the heavies I am told,\r\nwould weigh about three hundred pounds. They are fed on round potatoes,\r\nand range in the forest of pines. At the village of Kaeferthal is a\r\nplantation of rhubarb, begun in 1769 by a private company. It contains\r\ntwenty arpens or jourries, and its culture costs about four or five\r\nhundred francs a year; it sometimes employs forty or fifty laborers\r\nat a time. The best age to sell the rhubarb at is the fifth or sixth\r\nyear, but the sale being dull, they keep it sometimes to the tenth year;\r\nthey find it best to let it remain in the ground. They sell about two\r\nhundred kentals a year at two or three francs a pound, and could sell\r\ndouble that quantity from the ground if they could find a market. The\r\napothecaries of Francfort and of England are the principal buyers. It\r\nis in beds, resembling lettice-beds; the plants four, five or six feet\r\napart. When dug, a thread is passed through every piece of root, and it\r\nis hung separate in a kind of rack; when dry it is rasped; what comes\r\noff is given to the cattle.\r\n\r\nApril 15. _Manheim._ _Spire._ _Carlsruhe._ The valley preserves its\r\nwidth, extending on each side of the river about ten or twelve miles,\r\nbut the soil loses much in its quality, becoming sandy and lean, often\r\nbarren and overgrown with pine thicket. At Spire is nothing remarkable.\r\nBetween that and Carlsruhe we pass the Rhine in a common skow with oars,\r\nwhere it is between three and four hundred yards wide. Carlsruhe is the\r\nresidence of the Margrave of Baden, a sovereign prince. His château is\r\nbuilt in the midst of a natural forest of several leagues diameter, and\r\nof the best trees I have seen in these countries: they are mostly oak,\r\nand would be deemed but indifferent in America. A great deal of money\r\nhas been spent to do more harm than good to the ground--cutting a number\r\nof straight allies through the forest. He has a pheasantry of the gold\r\nand silver kind, the latter very tame, but the former excessively shy.\r\nA little inclosure of stone, two and a half feet high and thirty feet\r\ndiameter, in which are two tamed beavers. There is a pond of fifteen\r\nfeet diameter in the centre, and at each end a little cell for them to\r\nretire into, which is stowed with boughs and twigs with leaves on them,\r\nwhich is their principal food. They eat bread also;--twice a week the\r\nwater is changed. They cannot get over this wall Some cerfs of a peculiar\r\nkind, spotted like fawns, the horns remarkably long, small and sharp,\r\nwith few points. I am not sure there were more than two to each main\r\nbeam, and if I saw distinctly, there came out a separate and subordinate\r\nbeam from the root of each. Eight angora goats--beautiful animals--all\r\nwhite. This town is only an appendage of the château, and but a moderate\r\none. It is a league from Durlach, half way between that and the river.\r\nI observe they twist the flues of their stoves in any form for ornament\r\nmerely, without smoking, as thus, _e. g._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nApril 16. _Carlsruhe._ _Rastadt._ _Scholhoven._ _Bischofheim._ _Kehl._\r\n_Strasburg._ The valley of the Rhine still preserves its breadth, but\r\nvaries in quality; sometimes a rich mulatto loam, sometimes a poor sand,\r\ncovered with small pine. The culture is generally corn. It is to be\r\nnoted, that through the whole of my route through the Netherlands and\r\nthe valley of the Rhine, there is a little red clover every here and\r\nthere, and a great deal of grape cultivated. The seed of this is sold\r\nto be made into oil. The grape is now in blossom. No inclosures. The\r\nfruit trees are generally blossoming through the whole valley. The high\r\nmountains of the Bergstrasse, as also of Alsace, are covered with snow.\r\nWithin this day or two, the every-day dress of the country women here is\r\nblack. Rastadt is a seat also of the Margrave of Baden. Scholhoven and\r\nKehl are in his territory, but not Bischofheim. I see no beggars since\r\nI entered his government, nor is the traveller obliged to ransom himself\r\nevery moment by a chausiee gold. The roads are excellent, and made so, I\r\npresume, out of the coffers of the prince. From Cleves till I enter the\r\nMargravate of Baden, the roads have been strung with beggars--in Hesse\r\nthe most, and the road tax very heavy. We pay it cheerfully, however,\r\nthrough the territory of Francfort and thence up the Rhine, because\r\nfine gravelled roads are kept up; but through the Prussian, and other\r\nparts of the road below Francfort, the roads are only as made by the\r\ncarriages, there not appearing to have been ever a day's work employed\r\non them. At Strasburgh we pass the Rhine on a wooden bridge.\r\n\r\nAt _Brussels and Antwerp_, the fuel is pit-coal, dug in Brabant. Through\r\nall Holland it is turf. From Cleves to Cologne it is pit-coal brought\r\nfrom England. They burn it in open stoves. From thence it is wood, burnt\r\nin close stoves, till you get to Strasburg, where the open chimney comes\r\nagain into use.\r\n\r\nApril 16th, 17th, 18th. _Strasburg._ The vin de paille is made in the\r\nneighborhood of Colmar, in Alsace, about ---- from this place. It takes\r\nits name from the circumstance of spreading the grapes on straw, where\r\nthey are preserved till spring, and then made into wine. The little juice\r\nthen remaining in them makes a rich sweet wine, but the dearest in the\r\nworld, without being the best by any means. They charge nine florins the\r\nbottle for it in the taverns of Strasburg. It is the caprice of wealth\r\nalone which continues so losing an operation. This wine is sought because\r\ndear; while the better wine of Frontignan is rarely seen at a good table\r\nbecause it is cheap.\r\n\r\n_Strasburg._ _Saverne._ _Phalsbourg._ As far as Saverne the country is\r\nin waiving hills and hollows; red, rich enough; mostly in small grain,\r\nbut some vines; a little stone. From Saverne to Phalsbourg we cross a\r\nconsiderable mountain, which takes an hour to rise it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig.1]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig.2]\r\n\r\nApril 19th. _Phalsbourg._ _Fenestrange._ _Moyenvic._ _Nancy._ Asparagus\r\nto-day at Moyenvic. The country is always either mountainous or hilly;\r\nred, tolerably good, and in small grain. On the hills about Fenestrange,\r\nMoyenvic, and Nancy, are some small vineyards where a bad wine is made.\r\nNo inclosures. Some good sheep, indifferent cattle, and small horses. The\r\nmost forest I have seen in France, principally of beech, pretty large.\r\nThe houses, as in Germany, are of scantling, filled in with wicker and\r\nmortar, and covered either with thatch or tiles. The people, too, here\r\nas there, are gathered in villages. Oxen plough here with collars and\r\nhames. The awkward figure of their mould-board leads one to consider what\r\nshould be its form. The offices of the mould-board are to receive the sod\r\nafter the share has cut under it, to raise it gradually, and to reverse\r\nit. The fore-end of it then, should be horizontal to enter under the sod,\r\nand the hind end perpendicular to throw it over; the intermediate surface\r\nchanging gradually from the horizontal to the perpendicular It should\r\nbe as wide as the furrow, and of a length suited to the construction of\r\nthe plough. The following would seem a good method of making it: Take\r\na block, whose length, breadth and thickness, is that of your intended\r\nmould-board, suppose two and a half feet long and eight inches broad\r\nand thick. Draw the lines _a d_ and _c d_, figure 1, with a saw, the\r\ntoothed edge of which is straight, enter at _a_ and cut on, guiding the\r\nhind part of the saw on the line _a b_, and the fore part on the line\r\n_a d_, till the saw reaches the points _c_ and _d_, then enter it at _c_\r\nand cut on, guiding it by the lines _c b_ and _c d_ till it reaches the\r\npoints _b_ and _d_. The quarter, _a b c d_, will then be completely cut\r\nout, and the diagonal from _d_ to _b_ laid bare. The piece may now be\r\nrepresented as in figure 2. Then saw in transversely at every two inches\r\ntill the saw reaches the line _c e_, and the diagonal _b d_, and cut out\r\nthe pieces with an adze. The upper surface will thus be formed. With a\r\ngauge opened to eight inches, and guided by the lines _c e_, scribe the\r\nupper edge of the board from _d b_, cut that edge perpendicular to the\r\nface of the board, and scribe it of the proper thickness. Then form the\r\nunderside by the upper, by cutting transversely with the saw and taking\r\nout the piece with an adze. As the upper edge of the wing of the share\r\nrises a little, the fore end of the board, _b c_, will rise as much\r\nfrom a strict horizontal position, and will throw the hind end, _e d_,\r\nexactly as much beyond the perpendicular, so as to promote the reversing\r\nof the sod. The women here, as in Germany, do all sorts of work. While\r\none considers them as useful and rational companions, one cannot forget\r\nthat they are also objects of our pleasures; nor can they ever forget\r\nit. While employed in dirt and drudgery, some tag of a ribbon, some ring,\r\nor bit of bracelet, earbob or necklace, or something of that kind, will\r\nshow that the desire of pleasing is never suspended in them. It is an\r\nhonorable circumstance for man, that the first moment he is at his ease,\r\nhe allots the internal employments to his female partner, and takes the\r\nexternal on himself. And this circumstance, or its reverse, is a pretty\r\ngood indication that a people are, or are not at their ease. Among the\r\nIndians, this indication fails from a particular cause: every Indian\r\nman is a soldier or warrior, and the whole body of warriors constitute\r\na standing army, always employed in war or hunting. To support that\r\narmy, there remain no laborers but the women. Here, then, is so heavy a\r\nmilitary establishment, that the civil part of the nation is reduced to\r\nwomen only. But this is a barbarous perversion of the natural destination\r\nof the two sexes. Women are formed by nature for attentions, not for\r\nhard labor. A woman never forgets one of the numerous train of little\r\noffices which belong to her. A man forgets often.\r\n\r\nApril 20th. _Nancy._ _Toule._ _Void._ _Ligny en Barrois._ _Bar le Duc._\r\n_St. Dizier._ Nancy itself is a neat little town, and its environs very\r\nagreeable. The valley of the little branch of the Moselle, on which it\r\nis, is about a mile wide: the road then crossing the head-waters of the\r\nMoselle, the Maes, and the Marne, the country is very hilly, and perhaps\r\na third of it poor and in forests of beech: the other two-thirds from\r\npoor up to middling, red, and stony. Almost entirely in corn, now and\r\nthen only some vines on the hills. The Moselle at Toule is thirty or\r\nforty yards wide: the Maese near Void about half that: the Marne at St.\r\nDizier about forty yards. They all make good plains of from a quarter\r\nof a mile to a mile wide. The hills of the Maese abound with chalk.\r\nThe rocks coming down from the tops of the hills, on all the road of\r\nthis day, at regular intervals like the ribs of an animal, have a very\r\nirregular appearance. Considerable flocks of sheep and asses, and, in\r\nthe approach to St. Dizier, great plantations of apple and cherry trees;\r\nhere and there a peach tree, all in general bloom. The roads through\r\nLorraine are strung with beggars.\r\n\r\nApril 21st. _St. Dizier._ _Vitry le Français._ _Chalons sur Marne._\r\n_Epernay._ The plains of the Marne and Sault uniting, appear boundless\r\nto the eye till we approach their confluence at Vitry, where the hills\r\ncome in on the right; after that the plains are generally about a mile,\r\nmulatto, of middling quality, sometimes stony. Sometimes the ground goes\r\noff from the river so sloping, that one does not know whether to call it\r\nhigh or low land. The hills are mulatto also, but whitish, occasioned by\r\nthe quantity of chalk which seems to constitute their universal base.\r\nThey are poor, and principally in vines. The streams of water are of\r\nthe color of milk, occasioned by the chalk also. No inclosures, some\r\nflocks of sheep; children gathering dung in the roads. Here and there\r\na château; but none considerable.\r\n\r\nApril 22d. _Epernay._ The hills abound with chalk. Of this they make\r\nlime, not so strong as stone lime, and therefore to be used in greater\r\nproportion. They cut the blocks into regular forms also, like stone, and\r\nbuild houses of it. The common earth too, well impregnated with this,\r\nis made into mortar, moulded in the form of brick, dried in the sun,\r\nand houses built of them which last one hundred or two hundred years.\r\nThe plains here are a mile wide, red, good, in corn, clover, Luzerne,\r\nSt. Foin. The hills are in vines, and this being precisely the canton\r\nwhere the most celebrated wines of Champagne are made, details must be\r\nentered into. Remember, however, that they will always relate to the\r\nwhite wines, unless where the red are expressly mentioned. The reason\r\nis that their red wines, though much esteemed on the spot, are by no\r\nmeans esteemed elsewhere equally with their white; nor do they merit\r\nequal esteem.\r\n\r\nA Topographical sketch of the position of the wine villages, the course\r\nof the hills, and consequently the aspect of the vine-yards.\r\n\r\n_Soil_, meagre, mulatto clay, mixed with small broken stone, and a little\r\nhue of chalk. Very dry.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Aspect_, may be better seen by the annexed diagram. The wine of Aij\r\nis made from _a_ to _b_, those of Dizij from _b_ to _c_, Auvillij _d_\r\nto _e_, Cumieres _e_ to _f_, Epernay _g_ to _h_, Perij _i_ to _k_. The\r\nhills are generally about two hundred and fifty feet high. The good wine\r\nis made only in the middle region. The lower region, however, is better\r\nthan the upper; because this last is exposed to cold winds, and a colder\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Culture._ The vines are planted two feet apart. Afterwards they are\r\nmultiplied (provignés). When a stock puts out two shoots they lay them\r\ndown, spread them open and cover them with earth, so as to have in the\r\nend about a plant for every square foot. For performing this operation\r\nthey have a hook, of this shape, [Illustration] and nine inches long,\r\nwhich, being stuck in the ground, holds down the main stock, while the\r\nlaborer separates and covers the new shoot. They leave two buds above\r\nthe ground. When the vine has shot up high enough, they stick it with\r\nsplit sticks of oak, from an inch to an inch and a half square, and four\r\nfeet long, and tie the vine to its stick with straw. These sticks cost\r\ntwo florins the hundred, and will last forty years. An arpent, one year\r\nwith another, in the fine vineyards, gives twelve pieces, and in the\r\ninferior vineyards twenty-five pieces, of two hundred bottles each. An\r\narpent of the first quality sells for three thousand florins, and there\r\nhave been instances of seven thousand two hundred florins. The arpent\r\ncontains one hundred verges, of twenty-two pieds square. The arpent of\r\ninferior quality sells at one thousand florins. They plant the vines in\r\na hole about a foot deep, and fill that hole with good mould, to make\r\nthe plant take. Otherwise it would perish. Afterwards, if ever they put\r\ndung, it is very little. During wheat harvest there is a month or six\r\nweeks that nothing is done in the vine-yard, that is to say, from the\r\n1st of August to the beginning of vintage. The vintage commences early\r\nin September, and lasts a month. A day's work of a laborer in the busiest\r\nseason is twenty sous, and he feeds himself: in the least busy season it\r\nis fifteen sous. Corn lands are rented from four florins to twenty-four;\r\nbut vine lands are never rented. The three façons (or workings) of an\r\narpent cost fifteen florins. The whole year's expense of an arpent is\r\nworth one hundred florins.\r\n\r\n_Grapes._--The bulk of their grapes are purple, which they prefer for\r\nmaking even white wine. They press them very lightly, without treading or\r\npermitting them to ferment at all, for about an hour; so that it is the\r\nbeginning of the running only which makes the bright wine. What follows\r\nthe beginning is of a straw color, and therefore not placed on a level\r\nwith the first. The last part of the juice, produced by strong pressure,\r\nis red and ordinary. They choose the bunches with as much care, to make\r\nwine of the very first quality, as if to eat. Not above one-eighth of\r\nthe whole grapes will do for this purpose. The white grape, though not so\r\nfine for wine as the red, when the red can be produced, and more liable\r\nto rot in a moist season, yet grows better if the soil be excessively\r\npoor, and therefore in such a soil is preferred, or rather, is used of\r\nnecessity, because there the red would not grow at all.\r\n\r\n_Wine._--The white wines are either mousseux, sparkling, or non-mousseux,\r\nstill. The sparkling are little drunk in France, but are almost alone\r\nknown and drunk in foreign countries. This makes so great a demand, and\r\nso certain a one, that it is the dearest by about an eighth, and therefore\r\nthey endeavor to make all sparkling if they can. This is done by bottling\r\nin the spring, from the beginning of March till June. If it succeeds,\r\nthey lose abundance of bottles, from one-tenth to one-third. This is\r\nanother cause increasing the price. To make the still wine, they bottle\r\nin September. This is only done when they know from some circumstance\r\nthat the wine will not be sparkling. So if the spring bottling fails to\r\nmake a sparkling wine, they decant it into other bottles in the fall,\r\nand it then makes the very best still wine. In this operation, it loses\r\nfrom one-tenth to one-twentieth by sediment. They let it stand in the\r\nbottles in this case forty-eight hours, with only a napkin spread over\r\ntheir mouths, but no cork. The best sparkling wine, decanted in this\r\nmanner, makes the best still wine, and which will keep much longer than\r\nthat originally made still by being bottled in September. The sparkling\r\nwines lose their briskness the older they are, but they gain in quality\r\nwith age to a certain length. These wines are in perfection from two to\r\nten years old, and will even be very good to fifteen. 1766 was the best\r\nyear ever known. 1775 and 1776 next to that. 1783 is the last good year,\r\nand that not to be compared with those. These wines stand icing very well.\r\n\r\n_Aij._ M. Dorsay makes one thousand and one hundred pieces, which\r\nsell, as soon as made, at three hundred florins, and in good years four\r\nhundred florins, in the cask. I paid in his cellar, to M. Louis, his\r\nhomme d'affaires, for the remains of the year 1783, three florins ten\r\nsous the bottle. Sparkling Champagne, of the same degree of excellence,\r\nwould have cost four florins, (the piece and demiqueue are the same;\r\nthe feuillette is one hundred bottles.) M. le Duc makes four hundred to\r\nfive hundred pieces. M. de Villermont, three hundred pieces. M. Janson,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pieces. All of the first quality, red and white\r\nin equal quantities.\r\n\r\n_Auvillaij._ The Benedictine monks make one thousand pieces, red and\r\nwhite, but three-fourths red, both of the first quality. The king's\r\ntable is supplied by them. This enables them to sell at five hundred\r\nand fifty florins the piece. Though their white is hardly as good as\r\nDorsay's, their red is the best. L'Abbatiale, belonging to the bishop of\r\nthe place, makes one thousand to twelve hundred pieces, red and white,\r\nthree-fourths red, at four hundred to five hundred and fifty florins,\r\nbecause neighbors to the monks.\r\n\r\n_Cumieres_ is all of the second quality, both red and white, at one\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred florins the piece.\r\n\r\n_Epernay._ Madame Jermont makes two hundred pieces at three hundred\r\nflorins. M. Patelaine, one hundred and fifty pieces. M. Mare, two\r\nhundred pieces. M. Chertems, sixty pieces. M. Lauchay, fifty pieces. M.\r\nCousin (Aubergiste de l'hôtel de Róhan à Epernay), one hundred pieces.\r\nM. Pierrot, one hundred pieces. Les Chanoines regulieres d'Epernay, two\r\nhundred pieces. Mesdames les Ursulines religieuses, one hundred pieces.\r\nM. Gilette, two hundred pieces. All of the first quality; red and white\r\nin equal quantities.\r\n\r\n_Pierrij._ M. Casotte makes five hundred pieces. M. de la Motte, three\r\nhundred pieces. M. de Failli, three hundred pieces. I tasted his wine of\r\n1779, one of the good years. It was fine, though not equal to that of M.\r\nDorsay, of 1783. He sells it at two florins ten sous to merchants, and\r\nthree florins to individuals. Les Seminaristes, one hundred and fifty\r\npieces. M. Hoquart, two hundred pieces. All of the first quality; white\r\nand red in equal quantities.\r\n\r\nAt Cramont, also, there are some wines of the first quality made. At\r\nAvisi also, and Aucy, Le Meni, Mareuil, Verzis-Verzenni. This last place\r\nbelongs to the Marquis de Sillery. The wines are carried to Sillery, and\r\nthere stored, whence they are called Vins de Sillery, though not made\r\nat Sillery.\r\n\r\nAll these wines of Epernay and Pierrij sell almost as dear as M. Dorsay's,\r\ntheir quality being nearly the same. There are many small proprietors who\r\nmight make wine of the first quality, if they would cull their grapes,\r\nbut they are too poor for this. Therefore, the proprietors before named,\r\nwhose names are established, buy of the poorer ones the right to cull\r\ntheir vineyards, by which means they increase their quantity, as they\r\nfind about one-third of the grapes will make wines of the first quality.\r\n\r\nThe lowest-priced wines of all are thirty florins the piece, red or\r\nwhite. They make brandy of the pumice. In very bad years, when their\r\nwines become vinegar, they are sold for six florins the piece, and made\r\ninto brandy. They yield one-tenth brandy.\r\n\r\nWhite Champagne is deemed good in proportion as it is silky and still.\r\nMany circumstances derange the scale of wines. The proprietor of the best\r\nvineyard, in the best year, having bad weather come upon him while he is\r\ngathering his grapes, makes a bad wine, while his neighbor, holding a more\r\nindifferent vineyard, which happens to be ingathering while the weather\r\nis good, makes a better. The M. de Casotte at Pierrij formerly was the\r\nfirst house. His successors, by some imperceptible change of culture,\r\nhave degraded the quality of their wines. Their cellars are admirably\r\nmade, being about six, eight or ten feet wide, vaulted, and extending\r\ninto the ground, in a kind of labyrinth, to a prodigious distance, with\r\nan air-hole of two feet diameter every fifty feet. From the top of the\r\nvault to the surface of the earth, is from fifteen to thirty feet. I\r\nhave nowhere seen cellars comparable to these. In packing their bottles,\r\nthey lay on their side; then cross them at each end, they lay laths, and\r\non these another row of bottles, heads and points; and so on. By this\r\nmeans, they can take out a bottle from the top, or where they will.\r\n\r\nApril 23d. _Epernay._ _Château Thieray._ _St. Jean._ _Meaux._ _Vergalant._\r\n_Paris._ From Epernay to St. Jean the road leads over hills, which in\r\nthe beginning are indifferent, but get better towards the last. The\r\nplains, wherever seen, are inconsiderable. After passing St. Jean, the\r\nhills become good, and the plains increase. The country about Vergalant\r\nis pretty. A skirt of a low ridge which runs in on the extensive plains\r\nof the Marne and Seine, is very picturesque. The general bloom of fruit\r\ntrees proves there are more of them than I had imagined from travelling\r\nin other seasons, when they are less distinguishable at a distance from\r\nthe forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_Travelling notes for Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Shippen, June 3, 1788._\r\n\r\n_General Observations._--On arriving at a town, the first thing is to\r\nbuy the plan of the town, and the book noting its curiosities. Walk\r\nround the ramparts when there are any, go the top of a steeple to have\r\na view of the town and its environs.\r\n\r\nWhen you are doubting whether a thing is worth the trouble of going to\r\nsee, recollect that you will never again be so near it, that you may\r\nrepent the not having seen it, but can never repent having seen it.\r\nBut there is an opposite extreme too, that is, the seeing too much. A\r\njudicious selection is to be aimed at, taking care that the indolence\r\nof the moment have no influence in the decision. Take care particularly\r\nnot to let the porters of churches, cabinets, &c., lead you through all\r\nthe little details of their profession, which will load the memory with\r\ntrifles, fatigue the attention, and waste that and your time. It is\r\ndifficult to confine these people to the few objects worth seeing and\r\nremembering. They wish for your money, and suppose you give it the more\r\nwillingly the more they detail to you.\r\n\r\nWhen one calls in the taverns for the _vin du pays_, they give what\r\nis natural and unadulterated and cheap: when _vin etrangere_ is called\r\nfor, it only gives a pretext for charging an extravagant price for an\r\nunwholesome stuff, very often of their own brewery. The people you will\r\nnaturally see the most of will be tavern keepers, _valets de place_, and\r\npostilions. These are the hackneyed rascals of every country. Of course\r\nthey must never be considered when we calculate the national character.\r\n\r\n_Objects of attention for an American._--1. Agriculture. Everything\r\nbelonging to this art, and whatever has a near relation to it. Useful\r\nor agreeable animals which might be transported to America. Species of\r\nplants for the farmer's garden, according to the climate of the different\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n2. Mechanical arts, so far as they respect things necessary in America,\r\nand inconvenient to be transported thither ready-made, such as forges,\r\nstone quarries, boats, bridges, (very especially,) &c., &c.\r\n\r\n3. Lighter mechanical arts, and manufactures. Some of these will be\r\nworth a superficial view; but circumstances rendering it impossible that\r\nAmerica should become a manufacturing country during the time of any man\r\nnow living, it would be a waste of attention to examine these minutely.\r\n\r\n4. Gardens, peculiarly worth the attention of an American, because it is\r\nthe country of all others where the noblest gardens may be made without\r\nexpense. We have only to cut out the superabundant plants.\r\n\r\n5. Architecture worth great attention. As we double our numbers every\r\ntwenty years, we must double our houses. Besides, we build of such\r\nperishable materials, that one half of our houses must be rebuilt in\r\nevery space of twenty years, so that in that time, houses are to be\r\nbuilt for three-fourths of our inhabitants. It is, then, among the most\r\nimportant arts; and it is desirable to introduce taste into an art which\r\nshows so much.\r\n\r\n6. Painting. Statuary. Too expensive for the state of wealth among us. It\r\nwould be useless, therefore, and preposterous, for us to make ourselves\r\nconnoisseurs in those arts. They are worth seeing, but not studying.\r\n\r\n7. Politics of each country, well worth studying so far as respects\r\ninternal affairs. Examine their influence on the happiness of the people.\r\nTake every possible occasion for entering into the houses of the laborers,\r\nand especially at the moments of their repast; see what they eat, how\r\nthey are clothed, whether they are obliged to work too hard; whether\r\nthe government or their landlord takes from them an unjust proportion\r\nof their labor; on what footing stands the property they call their own,\r\ntheir personal liberty, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n8. Courts. To be seen as you would see the tower of London or menagerie\r\nof Versailles, with their lions, tigers, hyenas, and other beast of prey,\r\nstanding in the same relation to their fellows. A slight acquaintance\r\nwith them will suffice to show you that, under the most imposing exterior,\r\nthey are the weakest and worst part of mankind. Their manners, could you\r\nape them, would not make you beloved in your own country, nor would they\r\nimprove it could you introduce them there to the exclusion of that honest\r\nsimplicity now prevailing in America, and worthy of being cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_Queries as to the rights and duties of the United States under her\r\ntreaties with France, and the laws of neutrality._\r\n\r\n1st. Do the treaties between the United States and France give to France\r\nor her citizens a _right_, when at war with a power with whom the United\r\nStates are at peace, to fit out originally and from the ports of the\r\nUnited States, vessels armed for war with or without commission?\r\n\r\n2d. If they give such a right, does it extend to all manner of armed\r\nvessels, or to particular kinds only? If the latter, to what kinds does\r\nit extend?\r\n\r\n3d. Do they give to France or her citizens, in the case supposed, a right\r\nto refit, or arm anew vessels, which, before their coming within any\r\nport of the United States, were armed for war with or without commission?\r\n\r\n4th. If they give such a right, does it extend to all manner of armed\r\nvessels, or to particular kinds only? If the latter, to what kinds does\r\nit extend? Does it include an _augmentation_ of force, or does it only\r\nextend to placing the vessel in _status quo_?\r\n\r\n5th. Does the twenty-second article of the treaty of commerce, in the case\r\nsupposed, extend to vessels armed for war on account of the Government\r\nof a power at war with France, or to merchant-armed vessels belonging\r\nto the subjects or citizens of that power, (viz.) of the description of\r\nthose which, by the English, are called letters of Marque ships; by the\r\nFrench, \"batiments armes en marchandize et en guerre\"?\r\n\r\n6th. Do the treaties aforesaid prohibit the United States from permitting\r\nin the case supposed, the armed vessels belonging to a power at war with\r\nFrance, or to the citizens or subjects of such power to come within the\r\nports of the United States, there to remain as long as they may think fit,\r\nexcept in the case of their coming in with prizes made of the subjects\r\nor property of France?\r\n\r\n7th. Do they prohibit the United States from permitting in the case\r\nsupposed, vessels armed on account of the government of a power at war\r\nwith France, or vessels armed for merchandise and war, with or without\r\ncommission, on account of the subjects or citizens of such power, or\r\nany vessels, other than those commonly called privateers, to sell freely\r\nwhatever they may bring into the ports of the United States, and freely\r\nto purchase in and carry from the ports of the United States, goods,\r\nmerchandise, and commodities, except as excepted in the last question?\r\n\r\n8th. Do they oblige the United States to permit France in the case\r\nsupposed, to sell in their ports the prizes which she or her citizens\r\nmay have made, of any power at war with her, the citizens or subjects\r\nof such powers, or exempt from the payment of the usual duties on ships\r\nand merchandise, the prizes so made, in the case of their being to be\r\nsold within the ports of the United States?\r\n\r\n9th. Do those treaties, particularly the Consular Convention, authorize\r\nFrance, as of right, to erect courts within the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, for the trial and condemnation of prizes made by armed\r\nvessels in her service?\r\n\r\n10th. Do the laws and usages of nations authorize her, as of right, to\r\nerect such courts for such purposes?\r\n\r\n11th. Do the laws of neutrality, considered relatively to the treaties\r\nof the United States with foreign powers, or independently of those\r\ntreaties, permit the United States in the case supposed, to allow to\r\nFrance or her citizens, the privilege of fitting out _originally_ in and\r\nfrom the ports of the United States, vessels armed and commissioned for\r\nwar, either on account of the government, or of private persons, or both?\r\n\r\n12th. Do those laws permit the United States to extend the like privilege\r\nto a power at war with France?\r\n\r\n13th. Do the laws of neutrality, considered as aforesaid, permit the\r\nUnited States, in the case supposed, to allow to France or her citizens\r\nthe privilege of refitting, or arming anew, vessels which, before their\r\ncoming within the United States, were armed and commissioned for war?\r\nMay such privilege include an _augmentation_ of the force of such vessels?\r\n\r\n14th. Do those laws permit the United States to extend the like privilege\r\nto a power at war with France?\r\n\r\n15th. Do those laws in the case supposed, permit merchant vessels of\r\neither of the powers at war to arm in the ports of the United States\r\nwithout being commissioned? May this privilege be rightfully refused?\r\n\r\n16th. Does it make any difference in point of principle, whether a vessel\r\nbe armed for war, or the force of an armed vessel be augmented in the\r\nports of the United States with means procured in the United States, or\r\nwith means brought into them by the party who shall so arm or augment\r\nthe force of such vessels? If the first be unlawful, is the last lawful?\r\n\r\n17th. Do the laws of neutrality, considered as aforesaid, authorize the\r\nUnited States to permit France, her subjects, or citizens, the sale within\r\ntheir ports of prizes made of the subjects or property of a power at war\r\nwith France, before they have been carried into some port of France and\r\nthere condemned, refusing the privilege to her enemy?\r\n\r\n18th. Do those laws authorize the United States to permit to France\r\nthe erection of courts within their territory and jurisdiction, for the\r\ntrial and condemnations of prizes refusing that privilege to a power at\r\nwar with France?\r\n\r\n19th. If any armed vessel of foreign power at war with another, with\r\nwhom the United States are at peace, shall make prize of the subjects\r\nor property of its enemy within the territory or jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, have not the United States a right to cause restitution\r\nof such prize? Are they bound or not by the principles of neutrality so\r\nto do, if such prize shall be within their power?\r\n\r\n20th. To what distance, by the laws and usages of nations, may the United\r\nStates exercise the right of prohibiting the hostilities of foreign\r\npowers at war with each other, within rivers, bays, and arms of the sea,\r\nand upon the sea along the coast of the United States?\r\n\r\n21st. Have vessels armed for war, under commission from a foreign power,\r\na right without the consent of the United States, to engage within their\r\njurisdiction seamen or soldiers, for the service of such vessels, being\r\ncitizens of that power or of another foreign power, or citizens of the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\n22d. What are the articles by name to be prohibited to both or either\r\nparty?\r\n\r\n23d. To what extent does the reparation permitted in the nineteenth\r\narticle of the treaty with France, go?\r\n\r\n24th. What may be done as to vessels armed in our ports before the\r\nPresident's proclamation? And what as to the prizes they made _before_\r\nand _after_?\r\n\r\n25th. May we within our own ports sell ships to both parties prepared\r\nmerely for merchandise? May they be pierced for guns?\r\n\r\n26th. May we carry either or both kinds to the ports of the belligerent\r\npowers for sale?\r\n\r\n27th. Is the principle that free bottoms make free goods, and enemies\r\nbottoms make enemies goods, to be considered as now an established part\r\nof the law of nations?\r\n\r\n28th. If it is not, are nations with whom we have no treaties, authorized\r\nby the law of nations to take out of our vessels enemy passengers, not\r\nbeing soldiers, and their baggage?\r\n\r\n29th. May an armed vessel belonging to any of the belligerent powers,\r\nfollow _immediately_ merchant vessels, enemies departing from our ports,\r\nfor the purpose of making prizes of them? If not, how long ought the\r\nformer to remain after the latter has sailed? And what shall be considered\r\nas the place of departure, from which the time is to be counted? And\r\nhow are the facts to be ascertained?\r\n\r\nThe first twenty-one questions by Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two to twenty-eight, by Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nTwenty-ninth, by the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_Heads of consideration on the conduct we are to observe in the war\r\nbetween Spain and Great Britain, and particularly should the latter\r\nattempt the conquest of Louisiana and the Floridas._\r\n\r\nThe dangers to us, should Great Britain possess herself of those\r\ncountries:--\r\n\r\nShe will possess a territory equal to half ours beyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nShe will reduce that half of ours which is on this side of the\r\nMississippi;--by her language, laws, religion, manners, government,\r\ncommerce, capital;--by the possession of New Orleans, which draws to\r\nit the dependence of all the waters of the Mississippi;--by the markets\r\nshe can offer them in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nShe will take from the remaining part of our States the markets they\r\nnow have for their produce;--by furnishing those markets cheaper with\r\nthe same articles, tobacco, rice, indigo, bread, lumber, arms, naval\r\nstores, furs.\r\n\r\nShe will have then possessions double the size of ours, as good in soil\r\nand climate.\r\n\r\nShe will encircle us completely, by these possessions on our land-board,\r\nand her fleets on our sea-board. Instead of two neighbors balancing each\r\nother, we shall have one with more than the strength of both.\r\n\r\nWould the prevention of this be worth a war?\r\n\r\nConsider our abilities to take part in a war. Our operations would be\r\nby land only. How many men should we need to employ?--their cost? Our\r\nresources of taxation and credit equal to this.\r\n\r\nWeigh the evil of this new accumulation of debt against the loss of\r\nmarkets, and eternal expense and danger from so overgrown a neighbor.\r\n\r\nBut this is on supposition that France, as well as Spain, shall be engaged\r\nin the war; for, with Spain alone, the war would be unsuccessful, and\r\nour situation rendered worse.\r\n\r\nNo need to take a part in the war as yet. We may choose our own time.\r\nDelay gives us many chances to avoid it altogether.\r\n\r\nIn such a choice of objects, Great Britain may not single out Louisiana\r\nand the Floridas. She may fail in her attempt on them. France and Spain\r\nmay recover them.\r\n\r\nIf all these chances fail, we should have to re-take them. The difference\r\nbetween re-taking and preventing, overbalanced by the benefits of delay.\r\nDelay enables us to be better prepared to obtain from the allies a price\r\nfor our assistance.\r\n\r\nSuppose these our ultimate views, what is to be done at this time?\r\n\r\n     1. As to Spain:--\r\n\r\n     If she be as sensible as we are, that she cannot save\r\n     Louisiana and the Floridas, might she not prefer their\r\n     independence to their subjection to Great Britain? Does\r\n     not the proposition of the Count d'Estaing furnish us an\r\n     opening to communicate our ideas on this subject to the\r\n     court of France, and through them to that of Madrid? and\r\n     our readiness to join them in guaranteeing the independence\r\n     of those countries? This might save us from a war, if Great\r\n     Britain respected our weight in a war; and if she does\r\n     not, the object would place the war on popular ground with us.\r\n\r\n     2. As to England?--say to Beckwith,--\r\n\r\n     That as to a treaty of commerce, we would prefer amicable\r\n     to adversary arrangements, though the latter would be\r\n     infallible, and in our own power: that our ideas are, that\r\n     such a treaty should be founded in perfect reciprocity, and\r\n     would, therefore, be its own price: that as to an alliance,\r\n     we can say nothing till its object be shown, and that it is\r\n     not to be inconsistent with existing engagements: that in\r\n     the event of a war between Great Britain and Spain, we are\r\n     disposed to be strictly neutral: that, however, we should\r\n     view with extreme uneasiness any attempts of either power\r\n     to seize the possessions of the other on our frontier, as\r\n     we consider our own safety interested in a due balance\r\n     between our neighbors. [It might be deemed advantageous\r\n     to express this latter sentiment, because, if there be\r\n     any difference of opinion in their councils, whether to\r\n     bend their force against North or South America, or the\r\n     islands (and certainly there is room for difference), and\r\n     if these opinions be nearly balanced, that balance ought\r\n     to be determined by the prospect of having an enemy the\r\n     more or less, according to the object they should select.]\r\n\r\nJuly 12th, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_Heads of consideration on the Navigation of the Mississippi, for Mr.\r\nCarmichael, Aug. 22d, 1790._\r\n\r\nWe have a _right_ to the navigation of the Mississippi--1, by Nature;\r\n2, by Treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is _necessary_ to us. More than half the territory of the United States\r\nis on the waters of that river. Two hundred thousand of our citizens are\r\nsettled on them, of whom forty thousand bear arms. These have no other\r\noutlet for their tobacco, rice, corn, hemp, lumber, house timber, ship\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto respected the indecision of Spain, because we wish\r\npeace;--because our western citizens have had vent at home for their\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nA surplus of production begins now to demand foreign markets. Whenever\r\nthey shall say, \"We cannot, we will not, be longer shut up,\" the United\r\nStates will be reduced to the following dilemma: 1. To force them to\r\nacquiescence. 2. To separate from them, rather than take part in a war\r\nagainst Spain. 3. Or to preserve them in our Union, by joining them in\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThe 1st is neither in our principles, nor in our power. 2d. A multitude\r\nof reasons decide against the second. It may suffice to speak out one:\r\nwere we to give up half our territory rather than engage in a just war\r\nto preserve it, we should not keep the other half long. 3d. The third\r\nis the alternative we must adopt.\r\n\r\nHow are we to obtain that navigation?\r\n\r\n     (A.) By _Force_.\r\n\r\n     I. Acting _separately_. That we can effect this with\r\n     certainty and promptitude, circumstances decide.\r\n\r\n     _Objection._ We cannot retain New Orleans, for instance,\r\n     were we to take it.\r\n\r\n     _Answer._ A moderate force may be so secured, as to hold\r\n     out till succored. Our succors can be prompt and effectual.\r\n     Suppose, after taking it, we withdraw our force. If\r\n     Spain retakes it by an expedition, we can recover it by\r\n     a counter-expedition, and so as often as the case shall\r\n     happen. Their expedition will be slow, expensive, and lead\r\n     to catastrophes. Ours sudden, economical, and a check can\r\n     have no consequences. We should associate the country to\r\n     our Union. The inhabitants wish this. They are not disposed\r\n     to be of the Spanish government. It is idle in Spain to\r\n     suppose our Western inhabitants will unite with them.\r\n     They could be quiet but a short time under a government\r\n     so repugnant to their feelings. Were they to come under\r\n     it for present purposes, it would be with a view to throw\r\n     it off soon. Should they remain, they would communicate a\r\n     spirit of independence to those with whom they should be\r\n     mixed.\r\n\r\n     II. Acting in _conjunction_ with Great Britain, and with\r\n     a view to partition. The Floridas (including New Orleans)\r\n     would be assigned to us. Louisiana (or all the Western\r\n     waters of the Mississippi) to them. We confess that such\r\n     an alliance is not what we would wish. Because it may\r\n     eventually lead us into embarrassing situations with\r\n     our best friend, and put the power of two neighbors into\r\n     the hands of one. L. Lansdowne has declared he gave the\r\n     Floridas to Spain rather than the United States as a bone\r\n     of discord with the House of Bourbon, and of re-union with\r\n     Great Britain. Connolly's attempt (as well as other facts)\r\n     proves they keep it in view.\r\n\r\n     (B.) By _Negotiation_.\r\n\r\n     I. What must Spain do of _necessity_? The conduct of\r\n     Spain has proved that the occlusion of the Mississippi is\r\n     system with her. If she opens it now, it will be because\r\n     forced by imperious circumstances. She will consequently\r\n     shut it again when these circumstances cease. Treaty\r\n     will be no obstacle. Irregularities, real or pretended,\r\n     in our navigators, will furnish color enough. Perpetual\r\n     broils, and finally war will ensue. Prudence, and even\r\n     necessity, imposes on us the law of settling the matter\r\n     now, _finally_, and not by _halves_. With experience of the\r\n     past and prospect of the future, it would be imbecility\r\n     in us to accept the naked navigation. With that, we must\r\n     have what is necessary to its use, and without which it\r\n     would be useless to secure its continuance; that is, a\r\n     port near the mouth to receive our vessels and protect the\r\n     navigation. But even this will not secure the Floridas and\r\n     Louisiana against Great Britain. If we are neutral, she\r\n     will wrest those possessions from Spain. The inhabitants\r\n     (French, English, Scotch, American) would prefer England\r\n     to Spain.\r\n\r\n     II. What then had Spain better do of _choice_? Cede to us\r\n     all territory on our side of the Mississippi: on condition\r\n     that we guarantee all her possessions on the Western waters\r\n     of that river, she agreeing further, to subsidize us if\r\n     the guarantee brings us into the war.\r\n\r\n     Should Great Britain possess herself of the Floridas and\r\n     Louisiana, her governing principles are conquest, colonization,\r\n     commerce, monopoly. She will establish powerful colonies\r\n     in them. These can be poured into the Gulf of Mexico for\r\n     any sudden enterprise there, or invade Mexico, their next\r\n     neighbor, by land. Whilst a fleet co-operates along shore,\r\n     and cuts off relief. And proceed successively from colony\r\n     to colony.\r\n\r\n     With respect to us, if Great Britain establishes herself\r\n     on our whole land-board our lot will be bloody and eternal\r\n     war, or indissoluble confederacy. Which ought we to choose?\r\n     What will be the lot of the Spanish colonies in the jaws\r\n     of such a confederacy? What will secure the ocean against\r\n     the monopoly?\r\n\r\n     Safer for Spain that we should be her neighbor, than\r\n     England. Conquest not in our principles: inconsistent with\r\n     our government. Not our interest to cross the Mississippi\r\n     for ages. And will never be our interest to remain united\r\n     with these who do. Intermediate chances save the trouble\r\n     of calculating so far forward.\r\n\r\n     Consequences of this cession, and guarantee: 1. Every\r\n     subject of difference will be removed from between Spain\r\n     and the United States. 2. Our interest will be strongly\r\n     engaged in her retaining her American possessions. 3. Spain\r\n     will be quieted as to Louisiana, and her territories west\r\n     of that. 4. She may employ her whole force in defence of\r\n     her islands and Southern possessions. 5. If we preserve\r\n     our neutrality, it will be a very partial one to her. 6.\r\n     If we are forced into the war, it will be, as we wish, on\r\n     the side of the House of Bourbon. 7. Her privateers will\r\n     commit formidable depredation on the British trade, and\r\n     occupy much of their force. 8. By withholding supplies\r\n     of provision, as well as by concurring in expeditions,\r\n     the British islands will be in imminent danger. 9. Their\r\n     expenses of precaution, both for their continental and\r\n     insular possessions, will be so augmented as to give a\r\n     hope of running their credit down. In fine, for a narrow\r\n     slip of barren, detached, and expensive country, Spain\r\n     secures the rest of her territory, and makes an ally where\r\n     she might have a dangerous enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Questions to be considered of._\r\n\r\nI. As to France.\r\n\r\nShall it be proposed to M. de Ternant to form a treaty ad referendum\r\nto this effect: The citizens of the United States and of France, their\r\nvessels, productions, and manufactures, shall be received and considered\r\neach in all the dominions of the other as if they were the native\r\ncitizens, or the ships, productions, or manufactures of the other; and the\r\nproductions of the sea shall be received in all the dominions of each,\r\nas if they were the productions of the country by the industry of whose\r\ncitizens they have been taken or produced from the sea. Saving only as\r\nto the persons of their citizens, that they shall continue under those\r\nin capacities for office, each with the other, which the constitution of\r\nFrance, or of the United States, or any of them, have or shall establish\r\nagainst foreigners of all nations, without exception?\r\n\r\nIf not, shall a treaty be proposed to him ad referendum, in which the\r\nconditions shall be detailed on which the persons, ships, productions,\r\nand manufactures of each shall be received with the other, and the\r\nimports to which they shall be liable be formed into a tariff?\r\n\r\nShall the Senate be consulted in the beginning, in the middle, or only\r\nat the close of this transaction?\r\n\r\nII. As to England.\r\n\r\nShall Mr. Hammond be _now_ asked whether he is instructed to give us any\r\nexplanations of the intentions of his court, as to the detention of our\r\nWestern posts, and other infringements of our treaty with them?\r\n\r\nShall he be now asked whether he is authorized to conclude, or to\r\nnegotiate any commercial arrangements with us?\r\n\r\n     November 26, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_Plan of a Bill concerning Consuls._\r\n\r\nThe matter of the bill will naturally divide as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Foreign Consuls residing within the United States under a convention.\r\n\r\nII. Consuls of the United States residing in foreign countries under a\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nIII. Provision for future conventions, and cases where there is no\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary observations._--Nothing should be inserted in the bill\r\nwhich is fully and adequately provided for by the convention with France,\r\nbecause weak magistrates may infer from thence, that the parts omitted\r\nwere not meant by the Legislature to be enforced.\r\n\r\nAre not the first, second and third sections of the printed bill\r\nobjectionable in this view? The instructions of the Executive to their\r\nconsuls will of course provide for the notification directed in the\r\nsecond clause.\r\n\r\nI. For carrying into full effect the convention between his most Christian\r\nMajesty and the United States of America, entered into for the purpose\r\nof defining and establishing the functions and privileges of their\r\nrespective Consuls and Vice-Consuls, Be it enacted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the United States of America, that where, in\r\nthe seventh article of the said convention, it is agreed when there shall\r\nbe no Consul or Vice-Consul of his most Christian King to attend to the\r\nsaving of the wreck of any French vessel stranded on the coast of the\r\nUnited States, or that the residence of the said Consul or Vice-Consul\r\n(he not being at the place of the wreck) shall be more distant from the\r\nsame place than that of the competent judge of the country, the latter\r\nshall immediately proceed to perform the office therein prescribed, the\r\nnearest (here name the officer) shall be the competent judge designated\r\nin the said article, and it shall be incumbent on him to perform the\r\noffice prescribed in the said article, and according to the tenor thereof.\r\nGo on to direct who, in conjunction with the Consul or Vice-Consul, (if\r\nthere be one,) shall ascertain the abatement of duties on the damaged\r\ngoods stipulated in this article.\r\n\r\nArticle 9th allows the Consuls of the most Christian King to arrest and\r\nimprison deserted captains, officers, mariners, seamen, and all others\r\nbeing part of a ship's crew. For which purpose they are to address\r\nthemselves to the courts, judges, and officers competent, who are to\r\naid in arresting the deserter, and to confine him in the prisons of the\r\ncountry. Say who are the competent courts, judges, and officers to whom\r\nhe is to apply, and what prisons they shall use.\r\n\r\nThis clause confines the terms of imprisonment to three months. The\r\nFrench Consuls represent that in many ports of the United States, no\r\nopportunity of re-conveying by a French ship occurs within that term, and\r\nthey ask a longer. Suppose it be referred to the Federal district judge\r\non application by the French Consul, and on his showing good cause, to\r\nprolong the term from time to time, not exceeding three months additional\r\nin the whole.\r\n\r\nArticle 12th. It is necessary to authorize some officer to execute\r\nthe sentences of the Consul, _not extending to life, limb or liberty_.\r\nWill it be best to require the Marshal residing at the port to do it,\r\n(and make it the duty, where none resides, to appoint a deputy residing\r\nthere,) or to allow the Consul to constitute some person of his nation an\r\nofficer for the purpose? If it should be thought indifferent to us, it\r\nmight be well to pay the French the compliment of asking their minister\r\nhere which he would prefer, and it would shield us from complaints of\r\ndelinquencies in the executing officer.\r\n\r\nII. Article 12th. Say by what law the Consul of the United States,\r\nresiding in the French dominion, shall decide the cases whereof he has\r\njurisdiction, viz.: by the same law by which the proper federal court\r\nwould decide the same case.\r\n\r\nDirect appeals from Consular sentences to the proper Federal court,\r\nand save defects of formality in proceedings, where the matter is\r\nsubstantially stated.\r\n\r\nArticle 4th. Declare what validity the authentication under the Consular\r\nseal, of any instrument executed in foreign countries, shall have in\r\nthe courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n     [Duties not prescribed in the Convention.]\r\n\r\nTo subsist ship-wrecked or wandering seamen till an opportunity offers\r\nof sending them back to some port of the United States, and to oblige\r\nevery master of an American vessel homeward bound, to receive and bring\r\nthem back in a certain proportion; they working, if able.\r\n\r\nWhere a ship is sold in a foreign port, oblige the master to send back\r\nthe crew, or furnish wherewithal to do it, on pain of an arrest by the\r\nConsul on his ship, his goods, and his person, (if the laws of the land\r\npermit it,) until he does it.\r\n\r\nOblige all American masters (on pain of arrest, till compliance, of\r\ntheir vessel, cargo, or person, or such other pain as shall be thought\r\neffectual) on their arrival in any foreign port within the jurisdiction\r\nof a Consul or Vice-Consul of the United States, to report to him or\r\nhis agent in the port, their ship's name, and owners, burthen, crew,\r\ncargo, and its owners, from what port of the United States they cleared,\r\nand at what ports they have touched. Also to report to the Consul the\r\ncargo they take in, and the port or ports of destination, and to take\r\nhis certificate that such report has been made, on like pain.\r\n\r\nAllow certain fees to Consuls where none are already allowed, for the\r\nsame services, by the laws of the countries in which they reside.\r\n\r\nAllow salaries not exceeding three thousand dollars to one Consul in\r\neach of the Barbary States.\r\n\r\nIII. Where there are Consuls of the United States residing in foreign\r\ncountries, with which we have no convention, but whose governments indulge\r\nour Consuls in the exercise of functions, extend the provisions of this\r\nbill, or such of them as such government permits, to such Consuls of\r\nthe United States residing with them.\r\n\r\nAlso where any Consular Convention shall hereafter be removed with\r\nthe same, or entered into with any other nation, with stipulations\r\ncorresponding to those provided for in this bill, extend the provisions\r\nof the bill respectively to the Consuls on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_Matters to be arranged between the Governments of England and United\r\nStates. December 12th, 1791._\r\n\r\nThe discussions which are opening between Mr. Hammond and our government,\r\nhave as yet looked towards no objects but those which depend on the treaty\r\nof peace. There are, however, other matters to be arranged between the\r\ntwo governments, some of which do not rest on that treaty. The following\r\nis a statement of the whole of them:\r\n\r\n1st. The Western ports.\r\n\r\n2d. The negroes carried away.\r\n\r\n3d. The debt of their bank to Maryland, and perhaps Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n4th. Goods taken from the inhabitants of Boston, while the town was in\r\ntheir possession, and compensation promised.\r\n\r\n5th. Prizes taken after the dates at which hostilities were to cease.\r\n\r\n6th. Subsistence of prisoners.\r\n\r\n7th. The Eastern boundary.\r\n\r\nWhich of these shall be taken into the present discussion?\r\n\r\nWhich of them shall be left to arrangement through the ordinary channels\r\nof our ministers, in order to avoid embarrassing the more important\r\npoints with matters of less consequence?\r\n\r\nOn the subject of commerce shall Mr. Hammond be desired to produce his\r\npowers to treat, as is usual, before conferences are held on that subject?\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum of communications made to a committee of the Senate on the\r\nsubject of the diplomatic nominations to Paris, London, and the Hague.\r\nJanuary 4th, 1792._\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State having yesterday received a note from Mr. Strong,\r\nas chairman of a committee of the Senate, asking a conference with him\r\non the subject of the late diplomatic nominations to Paris, London, and\r\nthe Hague, he met them in the Senate-chamber in the evening of the same\r\nday, and stated to them in substance what follows:--\r\n\r\nThat he should on all occasions be ready to give to the Senate, or to\r\nany other branch of the government, whatever information might properly\r\nbe communicated, and might be necessary to enable them to proceed in\r\nthe line of their respective offices: that on the present occasion,\r\nparticularly, _as the Senate had to decide on the fitness of certain\r\npersons to act for the United States at certain courts, they would be\r\nthe better enabled to decide, if they were informed of the state of our\r\naffairs at those courts, and what we had to do there_: that when the\r\nbill for providing the means of intercourse with foreign nations was\r\nbefore the legislature, he had met the committees of each House, and\r\nhad given them the ideas of the executive as to the courts with which\r\nwe should keep diplomatic characters, and the grades we should employ:\r\nthat there were two principles, which decided on the courts, viz., 1,\r\n_vicinage_; and 2, _commerce_: that the first operated in the cases of\r\nLondon and Madrid, and the second in the same cases, and also in those\r\nof France and Portugal; perhaps, too, of Holland: that as to all other\r\ncountries, our commerce and connections were too unimportant to call\r\nfor the exchange of diplomatic residents: that he thought we should\r\nadopt the lowest grades admissible, to wit, at Paris that of minister\r\nplenipotentiary, because that grade was already established there; the\r\nsame at London, because of the pride of that court, and perhaps the sense\r\nof our country and its interests, would require a sort of equality of\r\ntreatment to be observed towards them; and for Spain and Lisbon, that\r\nof chargé des affaires only; the Hague uncertain: that at the moment of\r\nthis bill, there was a complete vacancy of appointments between us and\r\nFrance and England, by the accidental translations of the ministers of\r\nFrance and the United States to other offices, and none as yet appointed\r\nto, or from England: that in this state of things, the legislature had\r\nprovided for the grade of minister plenipotentiary, as one that was\r\nto be continued, and showed they had their eye on that grade only, and\r\nthat of chargé des affaires; and that by the sum allowed, they approved\r\nof the views then communicated: that circumstances had obliged us to\r\nchange the grade at Lisbon to minister resident, and this of course would\r\nforce a change at Madrid and the Hague, as had been communicated at the\r\ntime to the Senate; but that no change was made in the salary, that of\r\nresident being made the same as had been established for a chargé des\r\naffaires.----He then added, the new circumstances which had supervened on\r\nthose general ones in favor of these establishments, to wit, with Paris,\r\nthe proposal on their part to make a liberal treaty, the present situation\r\nof their colonies which might lead to a freer commerce with them, and the\r\narrival of a minister plenipotentiary here; with London, their sending\r\na minister here in consequence of notorious and repeated applications\r\nfrom us, the powers given him to arrange the differences which had\r\narisen about the execution of the treaty, to wit, the posts, negroes,\r\n&c., which was now in train, and perhaps some authority to talk on the\r\nsubject of arrangements of commerce, and also the circumstances which\r\nhad induced that minister to produce his commission; with Madrid, the\r\ncommunication from the king, that he was ready to resume the negociations\r\non the navigation of the Mississippi, and to arrange that, and a port of\r\ndeposit on the most friendly footing, if we would send a proper person\r\nto Madrid for that purpose: he explained the idea of joining one of the\r\nministers in Europe to Mr. Carmichael for that purpose; with Lisbon, that\r\nwe had to try to obtain a right of sending flour there, and mentioned Del\r\nPinta's former favorable opinion on that subject: he stated, also, the\r\ninteresting situation of Brazil, and the dispositions of the court of\r\nPortugal with respect to our warfare with the Algerines; with Holland,\r\nthe negotiating loans for the transfer of the whole French debt there,\r\nan operation which must be of some years, because there is but a given\r\nsum of new money to be lent to any one nation. He then particularly\r\nrecapitulated the circumstances which justified the President's having\r\ncontinued the grade of minister plenipotentiary; but added, that whenever\r\nthe biennial bill should come on, each House would have a constitutional\r\nright to review the establishment again, and whenever it should appear\r\nthat either House thought any part of it might be reduced, on giving to\r\nthe executive time to avail themselves of the first convenient occasion\r\nto reduce it, the executive could not but do it; but that it would be\r\nextremely injurious now, or at any other time, to do it so abruptly as\r\nto occasion the recall of ministers, or unfriendly sensations in any of\r\nthose countries with which our commerce is interesting.\r\n\r\nThat a circumstance, recalled to the recollection of the Secretary of\r\nState this morning, induced him immediately to add to the preceding\r\nverbal communication a letter addressed to Mr. Strong in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n                                 PHILADELPHIA, January 4th, 1792.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,--I am just now made to recollect a mistake in one\r\n     of the answers I gave last night in the committee of the\r\n     Senate, and which, therefore, I beg leave to correct. After\r\n     calling to their minds the footing on which Mr. Morris\r\n     had left matters at the court of London, and informing\r\n     them of what had passed between the British minister here\r\n     and myself, I was asked whether this was all that had\r\n     taken place? Whether there had been no other or further\r\n     engagement? I paused, you may remember, to recollect. I\r\n     knew nothing more had passed on the other side the water,\r\n     because Mr. Morris' powers there had been determined,\r\n     and I endeavored to recollect whether anything else had\r\n     passed with Mr. Hammond and myself. I answered that this\r\n     was all, and added in proof, that I was sure nothing had\r\n     passed between the President and Mr. Hammond, personally,\r\n     and so I might safely say this was all. It escaped me that\r\n     there had been an informal agent here, (Colonel Beckwith,)\r\n     and so informal that it was thought proper that I should\r\n     never speak on business with him, and that on a particular\r\n     occasion, the question having been asked whether if a\r\n     British minister should be sent here, we would send one\r\n     in exchange? It was said, through another channel, that\r\n     one would doubtless be sent. Having only been present when\r\n     it was concluded to give the answer, and not having been\r\n     myself the person who communicated it, nor having otherwise\r\n     had any conversation with Colonel Beckwith on the subject,\r\n     it absolutely escaped my recollection at the moment the\r\n     committee put the question, and I now correct the error\r\n     I committed in my answer, with the same good faith with\r\n     which I committed the error in the first moment. Permit me\r\n     to ask the favor of you, sir, to communicate this to the\r\n     other members of the committee, and to consider this as\r\n     a part of the information I have had the honor of giving\r\n     the committee on the subject.\r\n\r\n     I am with the most perfect esteem, sir, Your most obedient\r\n     and most humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nWhich letter, with the preceding statement, contains the substance of\r\nwhat the Secretary of State has communicated to the committee, as far\r\nas his memory enables him to recollect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_Considerations on the subjects of Ransom, and Peace with the Algerines.\r\nApril 1st, 1792._\r\n\r\nI. The Ransom of our captive citizens, being fourteen in number.\r\n\r\nFor facts on this subject refer to the Reports of December 28th, 1790,\r\non the same ransom, and on the Mediterranean trade, and to Mr. Short's\r\nletter of August 21st, 1791, sent to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe probable cost will be one thousand five hundred dollars for the\r\ncommon men, and half as much more for officers: adding presents, duties,\r\nand other expenses, it will be little short of forty thousand dollars.\r\nThis must be ready money, and consequently requires a joint, but secret\r\nvote of both houses. An agent must be sent for the purpose.\r\n\r\nII. Peace, how best to be obtained?\r\n\r\n1st. By war; that is to say, by constant cruises in the Mediterranean.\r\nThis proved practicable by the experiment of M. de Massiac, by the\r\nPortuguese cruise. The co-operation of Portugal, Naples, Genoa, and Malta,\r\ncould possibly be obtained, but the expense would be considerable. Vessels\r\nmounting one hundred guns in the whole, would probably be wanting on our\r\npart. These would cost in the outset four hundred thousand dollars, and\r\nannually afterwards one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. It may\r\nbe doubted if this expense could be met during the present Indian war.\r\nIf it could, it is the most honorable and efficacious way of having peace.\r\n\r\n2d. By paying a gross sum for a peace of fifty years. Respectable\r\nopinions vary from three hundred thousand to one million dollars, as\r\nto the first cost. Then are to follow frequent occasional presents; and\r\nwith all this, the peace will not be respected unless we appear able to\r\nenforce it; and if able to enforce it, why not rely on that solely? The\r\nsame question arises here, to wit: are we able to meet this expense at\r\npresent?\r\n\r\n3d. By tribute annually.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, Danes, Swedes, and Venetians, pay about twenty-four thousand\r\ndollars a year. We might, perhaps, obtain it for something less. If for\r\nten or fifteen thousand dollars, it might be eligible. And by a tariff\r\nfor the ransom of the captives they shall take from us. If low, this\r\nmight do for the present. The agent to be sent for the purpose of ransom\r\nmight be authorized to treat; but should also make himself acquainted\r\nwith their coast, harbor, vessels, manner of fighting, &c. On either of\r\nthese plans a vote of the Senate will be requisite.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st or 2d the Representatives should be consulted, and perhaps\r\non the 3d or 4th. It will be best to bring it on by a message from the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Notes of a conversation with Mr. Hammond. June 3d, 1792._\r\n\r\nHaving received Mr. Hammond's letter of June 2d, informing me that my\r\nletter of May 29th should be sent to his court for their instructions,\r\nI immediately went to his house. He was not at home. I wrote him a\r\nnote, inviting him to come and dine with me alone, that we might confer\r\ntogether in a familiar way on the subject of our letters, and consider\r\nwhat was to be done. He was engaged, but said he would call on me any\r\nhour the next day. I invited him to take a solo dinner the next day.\r\nHe accepted and came. After the cloth was taken off, and the servants\r\nretired, I introduced the conversation by adverting to that part of his\r\nletter wherein he disavowed any intentional deception, if he had been\r\nmisinformed, and had misstated any facts, assuring him that I acquitted\r\nhim of every suspicion of that kind: that he had been here too short a\r\ntime to be acquainted with facts himself, or to know the best sources\r\nfor getting at them: that I had found great difficulty myself in the\r\ninvestigation of facts, and with respect to the proceedings of the\r\ncourts particularly, had been indebted to the circumstance of Congress\r\nbeing in session, so that I could apply to the members of the different\r\nStates for information respecting their States. I told him that each\r\nparty having now stated the matters between the two nations in the point\r\nof view in which they appeared to each, had hoped that we might by the\r\nway of free conversation abridge what remained: that I expected we were\r\nto take for our basis, that the treaty was to be fully executed: that,\r\non our part, we had pronounced our demands explicitly, to have the\r\nupper posts delivered up, and the negroes paid for: that they objected\r\ninfractions on our part, which we denied: that we ought to proceed to\r\ninvestigate the facts on which we differed: that this was the country\r\nin which they could alone be investigated; and if it should be found\r\nwe had _unjustifiably_ broken the treaty, the case was of a nature to\r\nadmit of a proper compromise.\r\n\r\nHe said that he believed the question had never been understood by his\r\ncourt;--admitted they had as yet heard only one side of it, and that\r\nfrom a party which entertained strong feelings against us (I think he\r\nsaid the Refugees): that the idea would be quite new to his court, of\r\ntheir having committed the first infraction, and of the proceedings\r\non the subject of their debts here being on the ground of retaliation:\r\nthat this gave the case a complexion so entirely new and different from\r\nwhat had been contemplated, that he should not be justified in taking a\r\nsingle step: that he should send my letter to the ministers--that they\r\nwould be able to consider facts and dates, see if they had really been\r\nthe first infractors, and say what ground they would take on this new\r\nstate of the case: that the matter was now for the first time carried\r\ninto mutual discussion: that the close of my letter contained specific\r\npropositions, to which they would of course give specific answers\r\nadapted to the new statement of things brought forward. I replied, that\r\nas to the fact of their committing the first infraction, it could not\r\nbe questioned: confessed that I believe the ministers which signed the\r\ntreaty, meant to execute it: that Lord Shelburne's plan was to produce\r\na new coalescence by a liberal conduct towards us: that the ministry\r\nwhich succeeded thought the treaty too liberal, and wished to curtail\r\nits effect in the course of executing it; but that if every move and\r\ncounter-move was to cross the Atlantic, it would be a long game indeed.\r\nHe said, no: that he thought they could take their ultimate ground at\r\nonce, on having before them a full view of the facts, and he thought it\r\nfortunate that Mr. Bord, from whom he got most of his information, and\r\nLord Dorchester, would be on the spot to bring things to rights, and he\r\nimagined he could receive his instructions before November.\r\n\r\nI told him that I apprehended that Lord Dorchester would not feel a\r\ndisposition to promote conciliation, seeing himself marked personally as\r\nan infractor; and mentioned to him the opinions entertained here of the\r\nunfriendliness of Mr. Bord's mind towards us. He justified Mr. Bord. He\r\nhad received information from their other consuls, and the factors of the\r\nmerchants, who assured him that they could furnish proofs of the facts\r\nthey communicated to him, and which he had advanced on their authority,\r\nand that he should now write to them to produce their authority. He\r\nadmitted that the debt to British subjects might be considered as\r\nliquidated from the Potomac northward: that South Carolina was making\r\na laudable effort to pay hers; and that the only important object now\r\nwas, that of Virginia, amounting by his list to two millions sterling:\r\nthat the attention of the British merchants from North to South was\r\nturned to the decision of the case of Jones and Walker, which he hoped\r\nwould take place at the present session, and let them see what they had\r\nto depend on. I told him that I was sorry to learn that but two judges\r\nhad arrived in Richmond, and that unless the third arrived they would\r\nnot take it up. I desired him to observe that the question in that case\r\nrelated only to that description of debts which had been paid into\r\nthe treasury: that without pretending to know with any accuracy what\r\nproportion of the whole debt of Virginia had been paid into the treasury,\r\nI believed it was a small one; but the case of Jones and Walker would\r\nbe a precedent for those debts only: that as to the great residuary\r\nmass, there were precedents enough, as it appeared they were in a full\r\ncourse of recovery, and that there was no obstacle, real or apparent.\r\nHe did not appear to have adverted to the distinction, and showed marks\r\nof satisfaction on understanding that the question was confined to\r\nthe other portion of the debts only. He thought that the collection,\r\nthere being one under a hopeful way, would of itself change the ground\r\non which our difference stands. He observed that the treaty was of\r\nitself so vague and inconsistent in many of its parts, as to require an\r\nexplanatory convention. He instanced the two articles, one of which gave\r\nthem the navigation of the Mississippi, and the other bounded them by a\r\ndue west line from the Lake of the Woods, which being now understood to\r\npass beyond the most northern sources of the Mississippi, intercepted\r\nall access to that river: that to reconcile these articles, that line\r\nshould be so run as to give them access to the navigable waters of the\r\nMississippi, and that it would even be for our interest to introduce a\r\nthird power between us and the Spaniards. He asked my idea of the line\r\nfrom the Lake of the Woods, and of now settling it. I told him I knew\r\nof no objection to the settlement of it: that my idea of it was, that\r\nif it was an impassable line, as proposed in the treaty, it should be\r\nrendered passable by as small and unimportant an alteration as might\r\nbe, which I thought would be to throw in a line running due north from\r\nthe northernmost source of the Mississippi, till it should strike the\r\nwestern line from the Lake of the Woods: that the article giving them\r\na navigation in the Mississippi did not relate at all to this northern\r\nboundary, but to the southern one, and to the secret article respecting\r\nthat: that he knew that our Provisional Treaty was made seven weeks\r\nbefore that with Spain: that at the date of ours, their ministers had\r\nstill a hope of retaining Florida, in which case they were to come up\r\nto the thirty-second degree, and in which case also the navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi would have been important; but that they had not been\r\nable, in event, to retain the country to which the navigation was to\r\nbe an appendage. (It was evident to me that they had it in view to\r\nclaim a slice on our north-western quarter, that they may get into the\r\nMississippi; indeed, I thought it presented as a sort of make-weight with\r\nthe posts to compensate the great losses their citizens had sustained\r\nby the infractions charged on us.)\r\n\r\nI had hinted that I had not been without a hope, that an early possession\r\nof the posts might have been given us as a commencement of full execution\r\nof the treaty.\r\n\r\nHe asked me if I had conceived that he was authorized to write to the\r\nGovernor of Canada to deliver us the posts? I said I had. He smiled\r\nat that idea, and assured me he had by no means any such authority. I\r\nmentioned what I had understood to have passed between him and General\r\nDickinson, which was related to me by Mr. Hawkins, to wit: that the posts\r\nmight be delivered upon the assurance of the recovery of their debts in\r\nVirginia. He said, that if any such thing as that had dropped from him,\r\nit must have been merely as a private and unauthorized opinion, for that\r\nthe opinion of his court was, that the retention of the posts was but a\r\nshort compensation for the losses which their citizens had sustained, and\r\nwould sustain by the delay of their admission into our courts. (Putting\r\ntogether this expression and his frequent declarations that the face of\r\nthe controversy was now so totally changed from what it was understood\r\nto be at his court, that no instructions of his could be applicable to\r\nit, I concluded that his court had entertained no thought of ever giving\r\nup the posts, and had framed their instructions to him on a totally\r\ndifferent hypothesis.) He asked what we understood to be the boundary\r\nbetween us and the Indians? I told him he would see by recurring to my\r\nreport on the North Western Territory, and by tracing the line there\r\ndescribed on Hutchins' map. What did I understand to be our right in the\r\nIndian soil? 1st. A right of preëmption of their lands; that is to say,\r\nthe sole and exclusive right of purchasing from them whenever they should\r\nbe willing to sell. 2d. A right of regulating the commerce between them\r\nand the whites. Did I suppose that the right of preëmption prohibited\r\nany individual of another nation from purchasing lands which the Indians\r\nshould be willing to sell? Certainly. We consider it as established by\r\nthe usage of different nations into a kind of Jus gentium for America,\r\nthat a white nation settling down and declaring that such and such are\r\ntheir limits, makes an invasion of those limits by any other white nation\r\nan act of war, but gives no right of soil against the native possessors.\r\nDid I think the right of regulating the commerce went to prohibit the\r\nBritish traders from coming into the Indian territory? That has been\r\nthe idea. He said this would be hard on the Indians. I observed that\r\nwhichever way the principle was established, it would work equally on\r\nboth sides the line. I did not know whether we would gain or lose by\r\nmutual admission or exclusion. He said they apprehended our intention\r\nwas to exterminate the Indians and take the lands. I assured him that,\r\non the contrary, our system was to protect them, even against our own\r\ncitizens: that we wish to get lines established with all of them, and\r\nhave no views even of purchasing any more lands of them for a long time.\r\nWe consider them as a maze chaussee, or police, for scouring the woods\r\non our borders, and preventing their being a cover for rovers and robbers.\r\n\r\nHe wished the treaty had established an independent nation between us\r\nto keep us apart. He was under great apprehensions that it would become\r\na matter of bidding as it were, between the British and us, who should\r\nhave the greatest army there, and who should have the greatest force on\r\nthe lakes: that we, holding posts on this side the water, and they on\r\nthe other, soldiers looking constantly at one another, would get into\r\nbroils and commit the two nations in war. I told him we might perhaps\r\nregulate by agreement the force to be kept on each side.\r\n\r\nHe asked what was our view in keeping a force there: that he apprehended\r\nif we had these posts, we should be able to hinder vessels from passing.\r\nI answered that I did not know whether the position of the present posts\r\nwas such as that no vessel could pass but within their gun-shot; but\r\nthat each party must have a plenty of such positions on the opposite\r\nsides, exclusively of the present posts: that our view in possessing\r\nthese posts was to awe the Indians, to participate in the fur trade,\r\nto protect that trade. Protect it against whom? Against the Indians.\r\nHe asked what I imagined to be their motives for keeping the posts? To\r\ninfluence the Indians, to keep off a rival nation and the appearance of\r\nhaving a rival nation, to monopolize the fur trade. He said he was not\r\nafraid of rivals if the traders would have fair play. He thought it would\r\nbe better that neither party should have any military posts, but only\r\ntrading houses. I told him that the idea of having no military posts on\r\neither side was new to me: that it had never been mentioned among the\r\nmembers of the executive: that therefore I could only speak for myself\r\nand say that, _primâ facie_, it accorded well with two favorite ideas\r\nof mine, of leaving commerce free, and never keeping an unnecessary\r\nsoldier; but when he spoke of having no military posts on either side,\r\nthere might be difficulty in fixing the distance of the nearest posts.\r\nHe said that though his opinion on this subject was only a private one,\r\nand he understood mine to be so also, yet he was much pleased that we\r\ntwo seemed to think nearly alike, as it might lead to something. He said\r\nthat their principal object in the fur trade was the consumption of the\r\ngoods they gave in exchange for the furs. I answered that whether the\r\ntrade was carried on by English or Americans, it would be with English\r\ngoods, and the route would be, not through Canada, but by the shorter\r\nchannels of the Hudson or Potomac.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that the above is in the exact order, or the exact\r\nwords of the conversation. This was often desultory, and I can only answer\r\nfor having given generally the expression, and always the substance of\r\nwhat passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Extempore thoughts and doubts, on very superficially running over the\r\nBankrupt Bill._\r\n\r\nThe British statute excepts expressly farmers, graziers, drovers, as\r\nsuch, though they buy to sell again. This bill has no exception.\r\n\r\nThe British adjudications exempt the buyers and sellers of bank-stock,\r\ngovernment papers, &c. What feelings guided the draughtsman in adhering\r\nto his original in this case, and departing from it in the other?\r\n\r\nThe British courts adjudge that any artists may be bankrupts if the\r\nmaterials of their art are bought, such as shoemakers, blacksmiths,\r\ncarpenters, &c. Will the body of our artists desire to be brought within\r\nthe vortex of this law? It will follow as a consequence that the master\r\nwho has an artist of this kind in his family, whether hired, indentured,\r\nor a slave, to serve the purposes of his farm or family, but who may at\r\nleisure times do something for his neighbors also, may be a bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe British law makes a departure from the realm, i. e. out of the\r\nmediation of British law, an act of bankruptcy. This bill makes a\r\ndeparture from the _State wherein he resides_, (though into a neighboring\r\none where the laws of the United States run equally,) an act of\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners may open houses, break open doors, chests, &c. Are\r\nwe really ripe for this? Is that spirit of independence and sovereignty\r\nwhich a man feels in his own house, and which Englishmen felt when they\r\ndenominated their houses their castles, to be absolutely subdued? and\r\nis it expedient that it should be subdued?\r\n\r\nThe lands of the bankrupt are to be taken, sold, &c. Is not this a\r\npredominant question between the general and State Legislatures?\r\n\r\nIs commerce so much the basis of the existence of the United States as\r\nto call for a bankrupt law? On the contrary, are we not almost merely\r\nagricultural? Should not all laws be made with a view essentially to\r\nthe poor husbandmen? When laws are wanting for particular descriptions\r\nof other callings, should not the husbandmen be carefully excused from\r\ntheir operation, and preserved under that of the general system only;\r\nwhich general system is fitted to the condition of husbandmen?\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\n_Heads of conversation with Mr. Hammond._\r\n\r\nThat I communicated to the President his information of the consent of\r\nthe Western Indians to hold conferences of peace with us, in the presence\r\nof Governor Simcoe:--took care to apprize him of the informality of\r\nthe conversation;--that it was accidental;--private;--the present to be\r\nconsidered equally so:--unnecessary to note to him that nothing like a\r\nmediation was suggested. 1st. Because so informal a conversation could\r\nnot include so formal a thing as a mediation. 2d. Because, an established\r\nprinciple of public law among the white nations of America, that while\r\nthe Indians included within their limits retain all other national\r\nrights, no other white nations can become their patrons, protectors, or\r\nmediators, nor in any shape intermeddle between them and those within\r\nwhose limits they are. That Great Britain would not propose an example\r\nwhich would authorize us to cross our boundary, and take under our\r\nprotection the Indians within her limits. 3d. Because, should the treaty\r\nprove ineffectual, it would singularly commit the friendship of the two\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThat the idea of Governor Simcoe's attendance was presented only as a\r\nthing desired by the Indians: that the consequences of this had been\r\nconsidered. It is not necessary in order to effect a peace. Our views\r\nso just, so moderate, that we have no fear of effecting peace if left to\r\nourselves. If it cannot be effected, it is much better that nobody on the\r\npart of England should have been present;--for however our government is\r\npersuaded of the sincerity of your assurances that you have not excited\r\nthe Indians, yet our citizens in general are not so. It will be impossible\r\nto persuade them the negotiations were not defeated by British agents:\r\nthat, therefore, we do not pretend to make the exclusion of Governor\r\nSimcoe a _sine quâ non_, provided he be there as a spectator, not as\r\na _party_, yet we should consider his declining to attend, either by\r\nhimself or any other person, as an instance of their friendship, and\r\nas an evidence of it particularly calculated to make due impression on\r\nthe minds of our citizens. That the place fixed on by the Indians is\r\nextremely inconvenient to us, because of the distance and difficulty\r\nof transporting provisions there. Three hundred thousand rations will\r\nprobably be requisite, if three thousand Indians attend. That if we had\r\ntime, we would have proposed some other place, for example the Maumee\r\ntowns; but there not being time, we shall do our best to make provision.\r\n1st. We shall collect and carry as much as possible through the Miami\r\nchannel. 2d. We shall hope for their permission to have purchases made\r\nin Upper Canada, and brought along the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Instructions to Andrew Michaud for exploring the Western Boundary.\r\nJanuary, 1793._\r\n\r\nSundry persons having subscribed certain sums of money for your\r\nencouragement to explore the country along the Missouri, and thence\r\nwestwardly to the Pacific ocean, having submitted the plan of the\r\nenterprise to the directors of the American Philosophical society, and\r\nthe society having accepted of the trust, they proceed to give you the\r\nfollowing instructions:\r\n\r\nThey observe to you that the chief objects of your journey are to find\r\nthe shortest and most convenient route of communication between the\r\nUnited States and the Pacific ocean, within the temperate latitudes,\r\nand to learn such particulars as can be obtained of the country through\r\nwhich it passes, its productions, inhabitants, and other interesting\r\ncircumstances. As a channel of communication between these States and\r\nthe Pacific ocean, the Missouri, so far as it extends, presents itself\r\nunder circumstances of unquestioned preference. It has, therefore, been\r\ndeclared as a fundamental object of the subscription (not to be dispensed\r\nwith) that this river shall be considered and explored as a part of the\r\ncommunication sought for. To the neighborhood of this river, therefore,\r\nthat is to say, to the town of Kaskaskia, the society will procure you\r\na conveyance in company with the Indians of that town now in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFrom thence you will cross the Mississippi and pass by land to the nearest\r\npart of the Missouri above the Spanish settlements, that you may avoid\r\nthe risk of being stopped.\r\n\r\nYou will then pursue such of the largest streams of that river as shall\r\nlead by the shortest way and the lowest latitudes to the Pacific ocean.\r\nWhen, pursuing those streams, you shall find yourself at the point\r\nfrom whence you may get by the shortest and most convenient route to\r\nsome principal river of the Pacific ocean, you are to proceed to such\r\nriver, and pursue its course to the ocean. It would seem by the latest\r\nmaps as if a river called Oregon, interlocked with the Missouri for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and entered the Pacific ocean not far southward\r\nof Nootka Sound. But the society are aware that these maps are not to be\r\ntrusted so far as to be the ground of any positive instruction to you.\r\nThey therefore only mention the fact, leaving to yourself to verify it,\r\nor to follow such other as you shall find to be the real truth.\r\n\r\nYou will in the course of your journey, take notice of the country\r\nyou pass through, its general face, soil, rivers, mountains, its\r\nproductions--animal, vegetable, and mineral--so far as they may be new\r\nto us, and may also be useful or very curious; the latitudes of places\r\nor material for calculating it by such simple methods as your situation\r\nmay admit you to practice, the names, members, and dwellings of the\r\ninhabitants, and such particulars as you can learn of their history,\r\nconnection with each other, languages, manners, state of society, and\r\nof the arts and commerce among them.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of animal history, that of the mammoth is particularly\r\nrecommended to your inquiries, as it is also to learn whether the Lama\r\nor Paca of Peru, is found in those parts of this continent, or how far\r\nnorth they come.\r\n\r\nThe method of preserving your observations is left to yourself, according\r\nto the means which shall be in your power. It is only suggested that\r\nthe noting them on the skin might be best for such as may be the most\r\nimportant, and that further details may be committed to the bark of\r\nthe paper-birch, a substance which may not excite suspicions among the\r\nIndians, and little liable to injury from wet or other common accidents.\r\nBy the means of the same substance you may perhaps find opportunities,\r\nfrom time to time, of communicating to the society information of your\r\nprogress, and of the particulars you shall have noted.\r\n\r\nWhen you shall have reached the Pacific ocean, if you find yourself\r\nwithin convenient distance of any settlement of Europeans, go to them,\r\ncommit to writing a narrative of your journey and observations, and take\r\nthe best measure you can for conveying it thence to the society by sea.\r\n\r\nReturn by the same, or some other route, as you shall think likely to\r\nfulfil with most satisfaction and certainty the objects of your mission,\r\nfurnishing yourself with the best proofs the nature of the case will\r\nadmit of the reality and extent of your progress. Whether this shall be\r\nby certificates from Europeans settled on the western coast of America,\r\nor by what other means, must depend on circumstances. Ignorance of the\r\ncountry through which you are to pass, and confidence in your judgment,\r\nzeal, and discretion, prevent the society from attempting more minute\r\ninstructions, and even from exacting rigorous observance of those already\r\ngiven, except, indeed, what is the first of all objects, that you seek for\r\nand pursue that route which shall form the shortest and most convenient\r\ncommunication between the higher parts of the Missouri and the Pacific\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly recommended to you to expose yourself in no case to\r\nunnecessary dangers, whether such as might affect your health or your\r\npersonal safety, and to consider this not merely as your personal\r\nconcern, but as the injunction of science in general, which expects its\r\nenlargement from your inquiries, and of the inhabitants of the United\r\nStates in particular, to whom your report will open new fields and\r\nsubjects of commerce, intercourse, and observation.\r\n\r\nIf you reach the Pacific ocean and return, the society assign to you\r\nall the benefits of the subscription before mentioned. If you reach the\r\nwaters only which run into that ocean, the society reserve to themselves\r\nthe apportionment of the reward according to the conditions expressed\r\nin the subscription. If you do not reach even those waters they refuse\r\nall reward, and reclaim the money you may have received here under the\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nThey will expect you to return to the city of Philadelphia to give in to\r\nthem a full narrative of your journey and observations, and to answer\r\nthe inquiries they shall make of you, still reserving to yourself the\r\nbenefit arising from the publication of such parts of them as are in\r\nthe said subscription reserved to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum relative to commissioners for laying off the federal city.\r\nMarch 11th, 1793._\r\n\r\n_Question 1st._--What sacrifice may be made to retain Mr. Johnson in\r\nthe office of commissioner for the federal territory?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--For such an object, it is worth while to give up the plan\r\nof an allowance per diem; to give, instead of that, a sum in gross, and\r\nto extend that sum to five hundred dollars per annum, and expenses; the\r\nlatter to be rendered in account.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Johnson persists in resigning, as it is evident Dr. Stewart will\r\nnot continue even for the above allowance, and Mr. Carroll does not\r\nappear to make any conditions, the President will be free as to Mr.\r\nCarroll and two new associates, to adhere to the allowance per diem\r\nalready proposed, or to substitute a sum in gross.\r\n\r\n_Question 2d._--May new commissioners be chosen in the town?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--It is strongly desirable that the commissioners should not\r\nbe of the town, nor interested in it; and this objection is thought a\r\ncounterpoise for a sensible difference in talents; but if persons of\r\nadequate talents and qualifications cannot be found in the country,\r\nit will be better to take them from the town, than to appoint men of\r\ninadequate talents from the country.\r\n\r\n_Question 3d._--How compensate them?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--If they come from the country, the per diem allowance is\r\nthought best; if from the town, a sum in gross will be best, and this\r\nmight be as far as three hundred dollars a year, and no allowance for\r\nexpenses. If partly from the town, and partly from the country, then\r\nthree hundred dollars a year to the former, and the same, with allowance\r\nof expenses, to the latter.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, Mr. Randolph and Thomas Jefferson having consulted together\r\non the preceding questions, with some shades of difference of opinion in\r\nthe beginning, concurred ultimately and unanimously in the above answers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Note given to the President relative to Genet._\r\n\r\nMr. Genet's declaration to the President at his reception, that France\r\ndid not wish to engage the United States in the present war by the clause\r\nof guarantee, but left her free to pursue her own happiness in peace,\r\nhas been repeated to myself in conversation, and to others, and even in\r\na public answer, so as to place it beyond question.\r\n\r\nSome days after the reception of Mr. Genet (which was May 17th), I went to\r\nhis house on business. The Attorney General went with me to pay his first\r\nvisit. After he withdrew, Mr. Genet told me Mr. Fornant had delivered\r\nhim my letter of May 15th on the four memorials of Mr. Hammond. He said\r\nsomething first of the case of the Grange, and then of the vessels armed\r\nat Charleston. He said that on his arrival there, he was surrounded\r\nsuddenly by Frenchmen full of zeal for their country, pressing for\r\nauthority to arm with their own means for its assistance: that they would\r\nfit out their own vessels, provide everything, man them, and only ask a\r\ncommission from him: that he asked the opinion of Governor Moultrie on\r\nthe subject, who said he knew no law to the contrary, but begged that\r\nwhatever was to be done, might be done without consulting him: that he\r\nmust know nothing of it, &c.: that hereupon he gave commission to the\r\nvessels: that he was of opinion that he was justified, not only by the\r\nopinions at Charleston, but by our treaties. I told him the President\r\nhad taken full advice on the subject, had very maturely considered it,\r\nand had come to the decision expressed in my letter. He said he hoped\r\nthe President had not so absolutely decided it, but that he would hear\r\nwhat was to be said against it. I told him I had no doubt but that\r\nthe President, out of respect to him and his country, would receive\r\nwhatever he should have to urge on the subject, and would reconsider\r\nit with candor. He said he would make it his business to write me a\r\nletter on the subject: that he thought the arming the privateers was\r\njustifiable; but that if the President should finally decide otherwise\r\n(though he could not think it would be right), yet he must submit; for\r\nthat assuredly his instructions were to do whatever would be agreeable\r\nto us. He showed, indeed, by his countenance, his manner, and words,\r\nthat such an acquiescence would be with reluctance; but I was and am\r\npersuaded he then meant it.\r\n\r\nMr. Genet called at my office on Tuesday sennight, or fortnight, say\r\n(July 16th or 9th), but I think it was Tuesday sennight; and knew it was\r\non a Tuesday, because he went from thence to the President's. He was\r\nsumming up to me the strength of the French naval force now arrived.\r\nI took that occasion to observe to him, that having such great means\r\nin his hands, I thought he ought not to hesitate in abandoning to the\r\norders of the government the little pickeroons which had been armed\r\nhere unauthorized by them, and which occasioned so much embarrassment\r\nand uneasiness: that certainly their good dispositions must be worth\r\nmore than the trifling services these little vessels could render. He\r\nimmediately declared, that having such a force in his hands, he had\r\nabandoned every idea of further armament in our ports: that these small\r\nobjects were now beneath his notice, and he had accordingly written to\r\nthe consuls to stop everything further of that kind; but that as to those\r\nwhich had been fitted out before, their honor would not permit them to\r\ngive them up, but he wished an oblivion of everything which had passed,\r\nand that in future the measure so disagreeable to the government should\r\nnot be pursued, though he thought it clearly justifiable by the treaty.\r\nI told him the government was of a different opinion: that both parties\r\nindeed had equal right to construe the treaty: that, consequently, he\r\nhad done his duty in remonstrating against our construction, but that\r\nsince the government remained finally persuaded of the solidity of its\r\nown construction, and had a right to act accordingly within their own\r\nlimits, it was now his duty, as a diplomatic man, to state the matter\r\nto his government, to ask and await their orders, and in the meantime\r\nto acquiesce, and by no means to proceed in opposition within our limits.\r\n\r\nIt was at the same time, he informed me, that he had sent out the Little\r\nDemocrat, July 26th, 1793, to obtain intelligence of the state of the\r\ncoast, and whether it was safe for the fleet to proceed round from\r\nNorfolk to New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\n_Rules for the regulation of our conduct towards the belligerent Powers\r\nrecommended to the President for his adoption._\r\n\r\n1st. The original arming and equipping of vessels in the ports of the\r\nUnited States by any of the belligerent powers for military service,\r\noffensive or defensive, is deemed unlawful.\r\n\r\n2d. Equipments of merchant vessels by either of the belligerent parties\r\nin the ports of the United States, purely for the accommodation of them\r\nas such, is deemed lawful.\r\n\r\n3d. Equipments in the ports of the United States of vessels of war in the\r\nimmediate service of the government of any of the belligerent parties,\r\nwhich, if done to other vessels, would be of a doubtful nature, as\r\nbeing applicable either to commerce or war, are deemed lawful, except\r\nthose which shall have made prize of the subjects, people or property\r\nof France, coming with their prizes into the ports of the United States,\r\npursuant to the seventeenth article of our treaty of amity and commerce\r\nwith France.\r\n\r\n4th. Equipments in the ports of the United States by any of the parties\r\nat war with France, of vessels fitted for merchandise and war, whether\r\nwith or without commissions, which are doubtful in their nature, as\r\nbeing applicable either to commerce or war, are deemed lawful, except\r\nthose which shall have made prize, &c.\r\n\r\n5th. Equipments of any of the vessels of France in the ports of the\r\nUnited States, which are doubtful in their nature, as being applicable\r\nto commerce or war, are deemed lawful.\r\n\r\n6th. Equipments of every kind in the ports of the United States of\r\nprivateers of the powers at war with France, are deemed unlawful.\r\n\r\n7th. Equipments of vessels in the ports of the United States which are\r\nof a nature solely adapted to war, are deemed unlawful; except those\r\nstranded or wrecked, as mentioned in the eighteenth article of our treaty\r\nwith France, the sixteenth of our treaty with the United Netherlands,\r\nthe ninth of our treaty with Prussia, and except those mentioned in the\r\nnineteenth article of our treaty with France, the seventeenth of our\r\ntreaty with the United Netherlands, the eighteenth of our treaty with\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\n8th. Vessels of either of the parties not armed, or armed previous to\r\ntheir coming into the ports of the United States, which shall not have\r\ninfringed any of the foregoing rules, may lawfully engage or enlist\r\ntherein their own subjects, or aliens not being inhabitants of the United\r\nStates, except privateers of the powers at war with France, and except\r\nthose vessels which shall have made prize, &c.\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1793. The foregoing rules having been considered by us at\r\nseveral meetings, and being now unanimously approved, they are submitted\r\nto the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n                                TH: JEFFERSON.      ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n                                H. KNOX.            EDW: RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\n_Opinion relative to the propriety of convening the Legislature at an\r\nearlier period than that fixed by law. August 4th, 1793._\r\n\r\nThe President having been pleased to propose for consideration, the\r\nquestion whether it be proper or not to convene the Legislature at an\r\nearlier period than that at which it is to meet by law, and at what\r\ntime? I am of opinion it will be proper.\r\n\r\n1st. Because the protection of our southern frontiers seems to render\r\nindispensable a war with the Creeks, which cannot be declared nor provided\r\nfor but by the Legislature, nor prudently undertaken by the Executive\r\non account of the consequences it may involve with respect to Spain.\r\n\r\n2d. Because several Legislative provisions are wanting to enable the\r\ngovernment to steer steadily through the difficulties daily produced\r\nby the war of Europe, and to prevent our being involved in it by the\r\nincidents and perplexities to which it is constantly giving birth.\r\n\r\n3d. Because, should we be involved in it, which is every day possible,\r\nhowever anxiously we endeavor to avoid it, the Legislature, meeting a\r\nmonth earlier, will place them a month forwarder in their provisions\r\nfor that state of things.\r\n\r\nI think the first Monday in November would be a proper time for convening\r\nthem, because, while it would gain a month in making provisions to prevent\r\nor prepare for war, it leaves such a space of time for their assembling\r\nas will avoid exciting alarm either at home or abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\n_Communication relative to our French relations. August 22d, 1793._\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson has the honor to enclose to the President the letter of\r\nthe National Assembly to him, of December 22d, 1792. Its most distinct\r\nobject seems to have been to thank the United States for their measures\r\nto St. Domingo. It glances blindly, however, at commercial arrangements,\r\nand on the 19th of February, the same Assembly passed the decree putting\r\nour commerce in their dominions on the footing of natives, and directing\r\ntheir executive council to treat with us on the subject. On this the\r\nfollowing questions arise:\r\n\r\n1st. Would the President choose to answer the letter, acknowledging\r\nits receipt, thanking them in turn for the favors to our commerce,\r\nand promising to consult the constitutional powers (the Senate) on the\r\nsubject of the treaty proposed?\r\n\r\n2d. Would he rather choose to make no reply to the letter, but that Mr.\r\nMorris be instructed to negotiate a renewal of Mr. Genet's powers to\r\ntreat, to his successor?\r\n\r\n3d. Or would he choose that nothing be said on the subject to anybody?\r\n\r\nIf the President would in his judgment be for a treaty on the principles\r\nof the decree, or any modification of them, the 1st or 2d measure will\r\nbe well to be adopted.\r\n\r\nIf he is against a treaty on those principles or any modification of\r\nthem, the 3d measure seems to be the proper one.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the origin of the principle that \"free bottoms make free\r\ngoods.\" Dec. 20th, 1793._\r\n\r\nA doubt being entertained whether the use of the word _modern_, as\r\napplied to the _law of nations_ in the President's proclamation, be not\r\ninconsistent with ground afterwards taken in a letter to Genet, I will\r\nstate the matter while it is fresh in my mind,--beginning it from an\r\nearly period.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that according to the general law of nations, the\r\ngoods of an enemy are lawful prize in the bottom of a friend, and the\r\ngoods of a friend privileged in the bottom of an enemy; or in other\r\nwords, that _the goods follow the owner_. The inconvenience of this\r\nprinciple in subjecting neutral vessels to vexatious searches at sea,\r\nhas for more than a century rendered it usual for nations to substitute\r\na _conventional_ principle _that the goods shall follow the bottom_,\r\ninstead of the _natural_ one before mentioned. France has done it in all\r\nher treaties; so I believe had Spain, before the American Revolution.\r\nBritain had not done it. When that war had involved those powers, Russia,\r\nforeseeing that her commerce would be much harassed by the British ships,\r\nengaged Denmark, Sweden, and Portugal to arm, and to declare that the\r\nconventional principle should be observed by the powers at war, towards\r\nneutrals, and that they would make common cause against the party who\r\nshould violate it; declaring expressly, at the same time, that that\r\nConvention should be in force only during the war then existing. Holland\r\nacceded to the Convention, and Britain instantly attacked her. But the\r\nother neutral powers did not think proper to comply with their stipulation\r\nof making common cause. France declared at once that she would conform\r\nto the conventional principle. This in fact imposed no new obligation on\r\nher, for she was already bound by her treaties with all those powers to\r\nobserve that principle. Spain made the same declaration. Congress gave\r\nsimilar orders to their vessels; but Congress afterwards gave instructions\r\nto their ministers abroad not to engage them in any future combination\r\nof powers for the general enforcement of the conventional principle\r\nthat goods should follow the bottom, as this might at some time or other\r\nengage them in a war for other nations; but to introduce the principle\r\nseparately with every nation by the treaties they were authorized to make\r\nwith each. It had been already done with France and Holland, and it was\r\nafterwards done with Prussia, and made a regular part in every treaty they\r\nproposed to others. After the war, Great Britain established it between\r\nherself and France. When she engaged in the present war with France, it\r\nwas thought extremely desirable for us to get this principle admitted by\r\nher, and hoping that as she had acceded to it in one instance, she might\r\nbe induced to admit it as a principle now settled by the common consent\r\nof nations, (for every nation, belligerent or neutral, had stipulated\r\nit on one or more occasions,) that she might be induced to consider it\r\nas now become a _conventional_ law of nations, I proposed to insert the\r\nword _modern_ in the proclamation, to open upon her the idea that we\r\nshould require the acquiescence in that principle as the condition of\r\nour remaining in peace. It was thought desirable by the other gentlemen;\r\nbut having no expectation of any effect from it, they acquiesced in the\r\ninsertion of the word, merely to gratify me. I had another view, which\r\nI did not mention to them, because I apprehended it would occasion the\r\nloss of the word.\r\n\r\nBy the ancient law of nations, _e. g._ in the time of the Romans, the\r\nfurnishing a limited aid of troops, though stipulated, was deemed a\r\ncause of war. In latter times, it is admitted not to be a cause of war.\r\nThis is one of the improvements in the law of nations. I thought we\r\nmight conclude, by parity of reasoning, that the guaranteeing a limited\r\nportion of territory, in a stipulated case, might not, by the modern law\r\nof nations, be a cause of war. I therefore meant by the introduction of\r\nthat word, to lay the foundation of the execution of our guarantee, by\r\nway of negotiation with England. The word was, therefore, introduced,\r\nand a strong letter was written to Mr. Pinckney to observe to Great\r\nBritain that we were bound by our treaties with the other belligerent\r\npowers to observe certain principles during this war: that we were\r\nwilling to observe the same principles towards her; and indeed, that\r\nwe considered it as essential to proceed by the same rule to all, and\r\nto propose to her to select those articles concerning our conduct in a\r\ncase of our neutrality from any one of our treaties which she pleased;\r\nor that we would take those from her own treaty with France, and make\r\na temporary Convention of them for the term of the present war; and he\r\nwas instructed to press this strongly. I told Genet that we had done\r\nthis; but instead of giving us time to work our principles into effect\r\nby negotiation, he immediately took occasion in a letter, to threaten\r\nthat if we did not resent the conduct of the British in taking French\r\nproperty in American bottoms, and protect their goods by _effectual\r\nmeasures_ (meaning by arms), he would give direction that the principle\r\nof our treaty of goods following the bottom, should be disregarded.\r\nHe was, at the same time, in the habit of keeping our goods taken in\r\nBritish bottoms; so that they were to take the gaining alternative of\r\neach principle, and give us the losing one. It became necessary to oppose\r\nthis in the answer to his letter, and it was impossible to do it soundly,\r\nbut by placing it on its true ground, to wit: that the law of nations\r\nestablished as a general rule that _goods should follow the owner_, and\r\nthat the making them _follow the vessel_ was an exception depending on\r\nspecial conventions only in those cases where the Convention had been\r\nmade: that the exception had been established by us in our treaties with\r\nFrance, Holland, and Prussia, and that we should endeavor to extend it\r\nto England, Spain, and other powers; but that till it was done, we had\r\nno right to make war for the enforcement of it. He thus obliged us to\r\nabandon in the first moment the ground we were endeavoring to gain, that\r\nis to say, his ground against England and Spain, and to take the very\r\nground of England and Spain against him. This was my private reason for\r\nproposing the term _modern_ in the proclamation; that it might reserve\r\nus a ground to obtain the very things he wanted. But the world, who knew\r\nnothing of these private reasons, were to understand by the expression\r\nthe _modern law of nations_, that law with all the improvements and\r\nmollifications of it which an advancement of civilization in _modern_\r\ntimes had introduced. It does not mean strictly anything which is not a\r\npart of the _law of nations_ in _modern_ times, and therefore could not\r\nbe inconsistent with the ground taken in the letter to Genet, which was\r\nthat of the _law of nations_, and by no means could be equivalent to\r\na declaration by the President of the specific principle, that _goods\r\nshould follow the bottom_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\n_An account of the Capitol in Virginia._\r\n\r\nThe Capitol in the city of Richmond, in Virginia, is the model of the\r\nTemples of Erectheus at Athens, of Balbec, and of the Maison quarrée of\r\nNismes. All of which are nearly of the same form and proportions, and\r\nare considered as the most perfect examples of cubic architecture, as\r\nthe Pantheon of Rome is of the spherical. Their dimensions not being\r\nsufficient for the purposes of the capitol, they were enlarged, but their\r\nproportions rigorously observed. The capitol is of brick, one hundred\r\nthirty-four feet long, seventy feet wide, and forty-five feet high,\r\nexclusive of the basement. Twenty-eight feet of its length is occupied\r\nby a portico of the whole breadth of the house, showing six columns in\r\nfront, and two intercolonnations in flank. It is of a single order,\r\nwhich is Ionic; its columns four feet two inches diameter, and their\r\nentablature running round the whole building. The portico is crowned by\r\na pediment, the height of which is two ninths of its span.\r\n\r\nWithin the body of the building, which is one hundred and six feet\r\nlong, are two tier of rooms twenty-one feet high each. In the lower,\r\nat one end, is the room in which the Supreme court sets, thirty feet by\r\nsixty-four feet with a vestibule fourteen feet by twenty-two feet, and\r\nan office for their clerk, fourteen feet by thirteen feet. In the other\r\nend is the room for the House of Delegates, thirty feet by sixty-four\r\nfeet, with a lobby fourteen feet by thirty-six feet. In the middle is\r\na room thirty-six feet square, of the whole height of the building, and\r\nreceiving its light from above. In the centre of this room is a marble\r\nstatue of General Washington, made at Paris, by Houdon, who came over\r\nto Virginia for the express purpose of taking his form. The statue is\r\nmade accurately of the size of life. A peristile of columns in the same\r\nroom, six feet from the wall, and twenty-two and a half feet high with\r\ntheir entablature, support a corridor above, serving as a communication\r\nfor all the upper apartments, the stairs landing in it. In the upper\r\ntier is a Senate chamber thirty feet square, an office for their clerk,\r\nfive rooms for committees and juries, an office for the clerk of the\r\nHouse of Delegates, a chamber for the Governor and Council, and a room\r\nfor their clerk. In the basement of the building are the Land office,\r\nAuditor's office, and Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe drawings of the Façade and other elevations, were done by Clarissault,\r\none of the most correct architects of France, and author of the\r\nantiquities of Nismes, among which was the Maison quarrée. The model in\r\nstucco was made under his direction, by an artist who had been employed\r\nmany years in Greece, by the Count de Choiseul, ambassador of France\r\nat Constantinople, in making models of the most celebrated remains of\r\nancient architecture in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\n_To the Speaker and House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia,\r\nbeing a Protest against interference of Judiciary between Representative\r\nand Constituent.--1797._\r\n\r\nThe petition of the subscribers, inhabitants of the counties of Amherst,\r\nAlbemarle, Fluvanna, and Coochland, sheweth:\r\n\r\nThat by the constitution of this State, established from its earliest\r\nsettlement, the people thereof have professed the right of being\r\ngoverned by laws to which they have consented by representatives chosen\r\nby themselves immediately: that in order to give to the will of the\r\npeople the influence it ought to have, and the information which may\r\nenable them to exercise it usefully, it was a part of the common law,\r\nadopted as the law of this land, that their representatives, in the\r\ndischarge of their functions, should be free from the cognizance or\r\ncoercion of the co-ordinate branches, Judiciary and Executive; and\r\nthat their communications with their constituents should of right, as\r\nof duty also, be free, full, and unawed by any: that so necessary has\r\nthis intercourse been deemed in the country from which they derive\r\nprincipally their descent and laws, that the correspondence between\r\nthe representative and constituent is privileged there to pass free of\r\nexpense through the channel of the public post, and that the proceedings\r\nof the legislature have been known to be arrested and suspended at times\r\nuntil the Representatives could go home to their several counties and\r\nconfer with their constituents.\r\n\r\nThat when, at the epoch of Independence, the constitution was formed\r\nunder which we are now governed as a commonwealth, so high were the\r\nprinciples of representative government esteemed, that the legislature\r\nwas made to consist of two branches, both of them chosen immediately\r\nby the citizens; and that general system of laws was continued which\r\nprotected the relations between the representative and constituent, and\r\nguarded the functions of the former from the control of the Judiciary\r\nand Executive branches.\r\n\r\nThat when circumstances required that the ancient confederation of this\r\nwith the sister States, for the government of their common concerns,\r\nshould be improved into a more regular and effective form of general\r\ngovernment, the same representative principle was preserved in the\r\nnew legislature, one branch of which was to be chosen directly by the\r\ncitizens of each State, and the laws and principles remained unaltered\r\nwhich privilege the representative functions, whether to be exercised\r\nin the State or General Government, against the cognizance and notice\r\nof the co-ordinate branches, Executive and Judiciary; and for its safe\r\nand convenient exercise, the inter-communication of the representative\r\nand constituent has been sanctioned and provided for through the channel\r\nof the public post, at the public expense.\r\n\r\nThat at the general partition of this commonwealth into districts, each of\r\nwhich was to choose a representative to Congress, the counties of Amherst,\r\nAlbemarle, Fluvanna, and Coochland, were laid off into one district:\r\nthat at the elections held for the said district, in the month of April,\r\nin the years 1795 and 1797, the electors thereof made choice of Samuel\r\nJordan Cabell, of the county of Amherst, to be their representative in\r\nthe legislature of the general government; that the said Samuel Jordan\r\nCabell accepted the office, repaired at the due periods to the legislature\r\nof the General Government, exercised his functions there as became a\r\nworthy member, and as a good and dutiful representative was in the habit\r\nof corresponding with many of his constituents, and communicating to us,\r\nby way of letter, information of the public proceedings, of asking and\r\nreceiving our opinions and advice, and of contributing, as far as might\r\nbe with right, to preserve the transactions of the general government\r\nin unison with the principles and sentiments of his constituents: that\r\nwhile the said Samuel J. Cabell was in the exercise of his functions\r\nas a representative from this district, and was in the course of that\r\ncorrespondence which his duty and the will of his constituents imposed\r\non him, the right of thus communicating with them, deemed sacred under\r\nall the forms in which our government has hitherto existed, never\r\nquestioned or infringed even by Royal judges or governors, was openly\r\nand directly violated at a Circuit court of the General Government, held\r\nat the city of Richmond, for the district of Virginia, in the month of\r\nMay of this present year, 1790: that at the said court, A, B, &c., some\r\nof whom were foreigners, having been called upon to serve in the office\r\nof grand jurors before the said court, were sworn to the duties of said\r\noffice in the usual forms of the law, the known limits of which duties\r\nare to make presentment of those acts of individuals which the laws have\r\ndeclared to be crimes or misdemeanors: that departing out of the legal\r\nlimits of their said office, and availing themselves of the sanction of\r\nits cover, wickedly and contrary to their fidelity to destroy the rights\r\nof the people of this commonwealth, and the fundamental principles of\r\nrepresentative government, they made a presentment of the act of the\r\nsaid Samuel J. Cabell, in writing letters to his constituents in the\r\nfollowing words, to wit: \"We, of the grand jury of the United States, for\r\nthe district of Virginia, present as a real evil, the circular letters\r\nof several members of the late Congress, and particularly letters with\r\nthe signature of Samuel J. Cabell, endeavoring, at a time of real public\r\ndanger, to disseminate unfounded calumnies against the happy government\r\nof the United States, and thereby to separate the people therefrom;\r\nand to increase or produce a foreign influence, ruinous to the peace,\r\nhappiness, and independence of these United States.\"\r\n\r\nThat the grand jury is a part of the Judiciary, not permanent indeed,\r\nbut in office, _pro hac vice_ and responsible as other judges are for\r\ntheir actings and doings while in office: that for the Judiciary to\r\ninterpose in the legislative department between the constituent and his\r\nrepresentative, to control them in the exercise of their functions or\r\nduties towards each other, to overawe the free correspondence which exists\r\nand ought to exist between them, to dictate what communications may pass\r\nbetween them, and to punish all others, to put the representative into\r\njeopardy of criminal prosecution, of vexation, expense, and punishment\r\nbefore the Judiciary, if his communications, public or private, do\r\nnot exactly square with their ideas of fact or right, or with their\r\ndesigns of wrong, is to put the legislative department under the feet\r\nof the Judiciary, is to leave us, indeed, the shadow, but to take away\r\nthe substance of representation, which requires essentially that the\r\nrepresentative be as free as his constituents would be, that the same\r\ninterchange of sentiment be lawful between him and them as would be\r\nlawful among themselves were they in the personal transaction of their own\r\nbusiness; is to do away the influence of the people over the proceedings\r\nof their representatives by excluding from their knowledge, by the terror\r\nof punishment, all but such information or misinformation as may suit\r\ntheir own views; and is the more vitally dangerous when it is considered\r\nthat grand jurors are selected by officers nominated and holding their\r\nplaces at the will of the Executive: that they are exposed to influence\r\nfrom the judges who are nominated immediately by the Executive, and who,\r\nalthough holding permanently their commissions as judges, yet from the\r\ncareer of additional office and emolument _actually_ opened to them of\r\nlate, whether _constitutionally_ or not, are under all those motives\r\nwhich interest or ambition inspire, of courting the favor of that branch\r\nfrom which appointments flow: that grand juries are frequently composed\r\nin part of bystanders, often foreigners, of foreign attachments and\r\ninterests, and little knowledge of the laws they are most improperly\r\ncalled to decide on; and finally, is to give to the Judiciary, and through\r\nthem to the Executive, a complete preponderance over the legislature,\r\nrendering ineffectual that wise and cautious distribution of powers made\r\nby the constitution between the three branches, and subordinating to\r\nthe other two that branch which most immediately depends on the people\r\nthemselves, and is responsible to them at short periods.\r\n\r\nThat independently of these considerations of a constitutional nature, the\r\nright of free correspondence between citizen and citizen on their joint\r\ninterests, public or private, and under whatsoever laws these interests\r\narise, is a natural right of every individual citizen, not the gift of\r\nmunicipal law, but among the objects for the protection of which municipal\r\nlaws are instituted: that so far as the attempt to take away this natural\r\nright of free correspondence is an offence against the privileges of\r\nthe legislative house, of which the said Samuel J. Cabell is a member,\r\nit is left to that house, entrusted with the preservation of its own\r\nprivileges, to vindicate its immunities against the encroachments and\r\nusurpations of a co-ordinate branch; but so far as it is an infraction of\r\nour individual rights as citizens by other citizens of our own State, the\r\njudicature of this commonwealth is solely competent to its cognizance,\r\nno other possessing any powers of redress: that the commonwealth retains\r\nall its judiciary cognizances not expressly alienated in the grant of\r\npowers to the United States as expressed in their constitution: that\r\nthat constitution alienates only those enumerated in itself, or arising\r\nunder laws or treaties of the United States made in conformity with its\r\nown tenor; but the right of free correspondence is not claimed under\r\nthat constitution nor the laws or treaties derived from it, but as a\r\nnatural right, placed originally under the protection of our municipal\r\nlaws, and retained under the cognizance of our own courts.\r\n\r\nYour petitioners further observe that though this crime may not be\r\nspecifically defined and denominated by any particular statute, yet\r\nit is a crime, and of the highest and most alarming nature; that the\r\nconstitution of this commonwealth, aware it would sometimes happen that\r\ndeep and dangerous crimes, pronounced as such in the heart of every\r\nfriend to his country and its free constitution, would often escape the\r\ndefinitions of the law, and yet ought not to escape its punishments,\r\nfearing at the same time to entrust such undescribed offences to\r\nthe discretion of ordinary juries and judges, has reserved the same\r\nto the cognizance of the body of the commonwealth acting by their\r\nrepresentatives in general assembly, for which purpose provision is made\r\nby the constitution in the following words, to wit: \"The Governor, when\r\nhe is out of office, and _others_ offending against the State, either\r\nby mal-administration, corruption, _or other means_ by which the safety\r\nof the State may be endangered, shall be impeachable by the House of\r\nDelegates. Such impeachment to be prosecuted by the Attorney General or\r\nsuch other person or persons as the house may appoint in the general\r\ncourt, according to the laws of the land. If found guilty, he or they\r\nshall be either forever disabled to hold any office under government,\r\nor removed from such offices _pro tempore_, or subjected to such pains\r\nor penalties as the law shall direct.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering then the House of Delegates as the standing inquest of\r\nthe whole commonwealth so established by the constitution, that its\r\njurisdiction as such extends over all persons within its limits, and\r\nthat no pale, no sanctuary has been erected against their jurisdiction\r\nto protect offenders who have committed crimes against the laws of the\r\ncommonwealth and rights of its citizens: that the crime committed by the\r\nsaid grand jurors is of that high and extraordinary character for which\r\nthe constitution has provided extraordinary procedure: that though the\r\nviolation of right falls in the first instance on us, your petitioners\r\nand the representative chosen immediately by us, yet in principle and\r\nconsequence it extends to all our fellow-citizens, whose safety is\r\npassed away whenever their representatives are placed, in the exercise\r\nof their functions, under the direction and coercion of either of the\r\nother departments of government, and one of their most interesting rights\r\nis lost when that of a free communication of sentiment by speaking or\r\nwriting is suppressed: We, your petitioners, therefore pray that you\r\nwill be pleased to take your constitutional cognizance of the premises,\r\nand institute such proceedings for impeaching and punishing the said\r\nA, B, &c., as may secure to the citizens of this commonwealth their\r\nconstitutional right: that their representatives shall in the exercise\r\nof their functions be free and independent of the other departments\r\nof government, may guard that full intercourse between them and their\r\nconstituents which the nature of their relations and the laws of the\r\nland establish, may save to them the natural right of communicating\r\ntheir sentiments to one another by speaking and writing, and may serve\r\nas a terror to others attempting hereafter to subvert those rights and\r\nthe fundamental principles of our constitution, to exclude the people\r\nfrom all direct influence over the government they have established by\r\nreducing that branch of the legislature which they choose directly, to a\r\nsubordination under those over whom they have but an indirect, distant,\r\nand feeble control.\r\n\r\nAnd your petitioners further submit to the wisdom of the two houses of\r\nassembly whether the safety of the citizens of this commonwealth in their\r\npersons, their property, their laws, and government, does not require\r\nthat the capacity to act in the important office of a juror, grand\r\nor petty, civil or criminal, should be restrained in future to native\r\ncitizens of the United States, or such as were citizens at the date of\r\nthe treaty of peace which closed our revolutionary war, and whether the\r\nignorance of our laws and natural partiality to the countries of their\r\nbirth are not reasonable causes for declaring this to be one of the\r\nrights incommunicable in future to adoptive citizens.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, your petitioners, relying with entire confidence on\r\nthe wisdom and patriotism of our representatives in General assembly,\r\nclothed preëminently with all the powers of the people which have not\r\nbeen reserved to themselves, or enumerated in the grant to the General\r\nGovernment delegated to maintain all their rights and relations not\r\nexpressly and exclusively transferred to other jurisdictions, and\r\nstationed as sentinels to observe with watchfulness and oppose with\r\nfirmness all movements tending to destroy the equilibrium of our excellent\r\nbut complicated machine of government, invoke from you that redress of\r\nour violated rights which the freedom and safety of our common country\r\ncalls for. We denounce to you a great crime, wicked in its purpose, and\r\nmortal in its consequences unless prevented, committed by citizens of\r\nthis commonwealth against the body of their country. If we have erred\r\nin conceiving the redress provided by the law, we commit the subject to\r\nthe superior wisdom of this house to devise and pursue such proceedings\r\nas they shall think best; and we, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.\r\n\r\n_Etiquette._\r\n\r\n     [Endorsed in Mr. Jefferson's hand: \"This rough paper\r\n     contains what was agreed upon.\"]\r\n\r\nI. In order to bring the members of society together in the first\r\ninstance, the custom of the country has established that residents shall\r\npay the first visit to strangers, and, among strangers, first comers to\r\nlater comers, foreign and domestic; the character of stranger ceasing\r\nafter the first visits. To this rule there is a single exception. Foreign\r\nministers, from the necessity of making themselves known, pay the first\r\nvisit to the ministers of the nation, which is returned.\r\n\r\nII. When brought together in society, all are perfectly equal, whether\r\nforeign or domestic, titled or untitled, in or out of office.\r\n\r\nAll other observances are but exemplifications of these two principles.\r\n\r\nI. 1st. The families of foreign ministers, arriving at the seat of\r\ngovernment, receive the first visit from those of the national ministers,\r\nas from all other residents.\r\n\r\n2d. Members of the Legislature and of the Judiciary, independent of\r\ntheir offices, have a right as strangers to receive the first visit.\r\n\r\nII. 1st. No title being admitted here, those of foreigners give no\r\nprecedence.\r\n\r\n2d. Differences of grade among the diplomatic members, gives no precedence.\r\n\r\n3d. At public ceremonies, to which the government invites the presence\r\nof foreign ministers and their families, a convenient seat or station\r\nwill be provided for them, with any other strangers invited and the\r\nfamilies of the national ministers, each taking place as they arrive,\r\nand without any precedence.\r\n\r\n4th. To maintain the principle of equality, or of _pêle mêla_, and prevent\r\nthe growth of precedence out of courtesy, the members of the Executive\r\nwill practice at their own houses, and recommend an adherence to the\r\nancient usage of the country, of gentlemen in mass giving precedence\r\nto the ladies in mass, in passing from one apartment where they are\r\nassembled into another.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Charges exhibited to the President of the United States against the\r\nHonorable Arthur Sinclair, as Governor of the territory of the United\r\nStates north-west of the river Ohio._\r\n\r\n1st. He has usurped legislative powers by the erection of counties\r\nand location of the seats of justice, by proclamation, on his own sole\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n2d. He has misused the power of negativing legislative acts, by putting\r\nhis negative on laws useful and necessary for the territory.\r\n\r\n3d. He has refused to perform the duties of his office but on the payment\r\nof arbitrary fees not established by any lawful authority.\r\n\r\n4th. He has negatived an act of the Legislature abolishing those fees, and\r\npassed their act giving him five hundred dollars--meant as a compensation\r\nfor that abolition, thereby holding both the fees and the compensation.\r\n\r\n5th. He has attempted to effect the dismemberment of the territory,\r\nand to destroy its constitutional boundaries, in order to prevent its\r\nadvancement to those rights of self-government to which its numbers\r\nwould entitle it.\r\n\r\n6th. He has granted commissions generally during pleasure; but that of\r\nAttorney General to his own son during good behavior.\r\n\r\n7th. He has endeavored arbitrarily to influence and control the\r\nproceedings of the Judiciary, and has revoked or effected a surrender\r\nof the commissions of those who have refused to bend to his will,\r\n(acknowledged, p. 22; revoked three commissions, p. 32.)\r\n\r\n8th. He has appointed persons residing out of a county to offices,\r\nthe duties of which were to be habitually performed within them.\r\n(Acknowledged, p. 20, in the case of Robb, his son-in-law, made Recorder\r\nof Clermont though living in Hamilton--executed by deputy.)\r\n\r\n9th. He has obstructed the organization and disciplining of a militia\r\nfor the defence of the territory, by withholding the appointment of\r\nofficers years after a law had passed establishing them.\r\n\r\n10th. He has avowed his hostility to the form and substance of republican\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n1st. The ordinance in the paragraph respecting counties, speaks of laws\r\nadopted or made, which must refer both to the first and second stage of\r\ngovernment; it then gives the Governor power to lay out counties from\r\ntime to time, reserving a right to the Legislature thereafter to alter\r\nthem. This may mean that the Governor is always to lay out first, and\r\nthe Legislature thereafter to alter; or it may mean that the Governor is\r\nto lay out during the first stage of government, and the Legislature to\r\ndo it in the second, _reddendo singula singulis_. The first construction\r\nrenders the power reserved the Legislature null, because the Governor\r\nhaving a negative will not permit the other branches to act against his\r\nopinion manifested in the original laying out. The second construction\r\ngives it full effect, and must therefore be understood to be that intended\r\nby Congress, who certainly meant to reserve a practicable right to the\r\nLegislature--not a nugatory one, and the rather as the forming counties\r\nis an act of law-making, not of the execution of a law. The place of\r\ndispensing justice may not seem essentially legislative at first view,\r\nbut to rest naturally with those who are to dispense it; yet when we\r\nconsider it in all its relations to public convenience as well as justice,\r\nat how early a date it was deemed a grievance in England, and fixed by\r\nlaw, and how universally so in these States, this gives a sure practical\r\nconstruction of what Congress must have intended.\r\n\r\n2d. The policy of giving a negative on laws to the Executive seems to\r\nbe: 1st, to provide protection against the Legislature for the other\r\nindependent departments. 2d. To protect such portions of the citizens as\r\nmight be oppressed by a local or partial interest happening to predominate\r\nin the Legislature at the moment. But not to set up the judgment of a\r\nsingle individual in cases of ordinary legislation against the collected\r\nwisdom of the nation. If these ideas be just, Governor Sinclair is guilty\r\non the second charge.\r\n\r\n5th. The ordinance permits the whole territory north-west of the Ohio\r\nto be divided by Congress into three or five States, and says, whenever\r\nany of the said _States_ shall have sixty thousand inhabitants it shall\r\nbe received in Congress. The change of boundary proposed by the late\r\nact of the north-west Legislature did divide the population into two\r\nparts, so that both would have been much longer reaching sixty thousand\r\nthan if the boundaries remained fixed by the ordinance. That the act\r\ndismembered that portion of territory which claimed to be a State, is\r\ncertain. That Governor Sinclair assented to it at least is certain. That\r\nhe promoted it by his influence, and with a view to continue himself and\r\nfriends the longer in place and power, is suggested by many, and will\r\nbe judged of by every one according to the opinion entertained of his\r\nattachment to his office, or his power of preserving his mind unbiassed\r\nby that attachment or any other particular views. See Sinclair's letter\r\nto Harrison, printed State papers, March 14th, 1800.\r\n\r\n6th. The censure implied in this charge seems to be not so much in the\r\nGovernor's giving commissions during pleasure in the judiciary line,\r\nthough a tenure for life there is familiar, as the making the Attorney\r\nGeneral an officer for life, a thing unprecedented, and its being in the\r\ncase of his own son. The reason assigned by the Governor that he gave him\r\nthis fixed tenure, because he at that time proposed himself to retire\r\nfrom office, and meant thus to protect his son against his successor,\r\nadmits the fact charged, and is far from justifying it.\r\n\r\n7th. Admitting the tenure of every commission, without any special\r\nlimitation, to be during the will of him who grants it, the conduct of\r\nthe three justices whose commission was revoked, and that of Mr. Finlay\r\nwhose resignation was not accepted, is not sufficiently clear of blame to\r\nfix the charge of arbitrarily influencing and controlling the judiciary.\r\n\r\n8th. This charge is admitted to be true by Governor Sinclair, in the\r\ncase of his son-in-law, made Recorder of Clermont, while he lived in\r\nHamilton. See pp. 20. He urges some matters in justification. Several\r\nother instances are stated by Worthington and Meigs. Will's case, p. 46.\r\n\r\n9th. This cannot be decided but on a view of the laws.\r\n\r\n4th. That one of these acts was meant as a compensation for the other,\r\nis not proved. See p. 24, 43.\r\n\r\n3d. The real charge here is that the Governor and judges selected laws\r\nfrom the codes of the States to give themselves fees. I was a member of\r\nCongress, and I believe of the committee which prepared the first plan\r\nfor the organization of the new States. A Legislature to be composed\r\nof the Governor and judges was a measure of necessity in the earliest\r\nstages of those territorial governments; yet we were sensible it was\r\nfundamentally wrong to submit freemen to laws made by officers of the\r\nExecutive. It was determined, then, they should not make laws themselves,\r\nbut adopt from the codes of the States, which being passed by freemen for\r\ntheir own government, it was supposed would never be oppressive. But no\r\none dreamt of their selecting laws to give themselves fees. For to what\r\na length might not this be carried by entitling themselves to fees for\r\nevery act which was allowed a fee in any single State. Their salaries\r\nwere certainly understood to be in lieu of all emoluments; yet they early\r\nbegan this abuse. Governor Sinclair and his associates set the example.\r\nIt was not unnoticed. But as every one had rather another should pass\r\npersonal censures than himself, the first laws for this purpose were\r\nlaid by myself before Congress with the other laws, without comment, the\r\npower of repealing being in them. Partly from much business, partly from\r\nno individual member being willing to come forward as the denunciator,\r\nthe thing went on till the arbitrary and intolerable temper of Governor\r\nSarjeant urged it on the notice of Congress. On the 12th of February,\r\n1795, this among other legislative practices, had been disapproved by\r\nthe House of Representatives, (report, p. 8, 9, February 19, 1801,) and\r\nlost in the Senate. But February 19, 1801, a committee of friends to\r\nSarjeant, appointed by his friend Sedgwick, reported it an abuse, but\r\nnot proceeding from criminal intentions, and therefore resolved that\r\nthere ought to be no further proceedings for mal-administration against\r\nhim, to which resolution the House disagreed by a vote of fifty against\r\nthirty-eight, though a federal house; but this being late in the day of\r\nthe 3d of March, 1801, on which day they were to rise, nothing further\r\ncould be done. But Governor Sarjeant's time expiring soon after, his\r\ncommission was not renewed for this among other reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.\r\n\r\n_Hints on the subject of Indian boundaries, suggested for consideration.\r\nDecember 29th, 1802._\r\n\r\nAn object, becoming one of great importance, is the establishment of\r\na strong front on our western boundary, the Mississippi, securing us\r\non that side, as our front on the Atlantic does towards the East. Our\r\nproceedings with the Indians should tend systematically to that object,\r\nleaving the extinguishment of title in the interior country to fall in\r\nas occasions may arise. The Indians being once closed in between strong\r\nsettled countries on the Mississippi and Atlantic, will, for want of game,\r\nbe forced to agriculture, will find that small portions of land, well\r\nimproved, will be worth more to them than extensive forests unemployed,\r\nand will continually be parting with portions of them for money to buy\r\nstock, utensils, and necessaries for their farms and families.\r\n\r\nOn the Mississippi, we hold at present from our southern boundary to\r\nthe Yazoo. From the Yazoo to the Ohio is the property of the Chickasaw,\r\na tribe the most friendly to us, and at the same time the most adverse\r\nto the diminution of their lands. The portion of their territory of\r\nfirst importance to us, would be the slip between the Mississippi on the\r\nwest, and on the east the Yazoo and the ridge dividing the waters of the\r\nMississippi and Tennessee. Their main settlements are eastward of this.\r\nI believe they have few within this and towards the Mississippi. The\r\nmethod by which we may advance towards our object will be, 1, to press\r\nthe encouragements to agriculture, by which they may see how little land\r\nwill maintain them much better, and the advantage of exchanging useless\r\ndeserts to improve their farms. 2. To establish among them a factory or\r\nfactories for furnishing them with all the necessaries and comforts they\r\nmay wish (spirituous liquors excepted), encouraging these, and especially\r\ntheir leading men, to run in debt for these beyond their individual\r\nmeans of paying; and whenever in that situation, they will always cede\r\nlands to rid themselves of debt. A factory about the Chickasaw bluffs,\r\nwould be tolerably central, and they might admit us to tend corn for\r\nfeeding the factory and themselves when at it, and even to fix some\r\npersons for the protection of the factory from the Indians west of the\r\nMississippi, and others. After awhile we might purchase these, and add\r\nto it from time to time. 3. We should continue to increase and nourish\r\ntheir friendship and confidence by every act of justice and of favor\r\nwhich we can possibly render them. What we know in favor of the other\r\nIndians, should not constitute the measure of what we do for these, our\r\nviews as to these being so much more important. This tribe is very poor,\r\nand they want necessaries with which we abound. We want lands with which\r\nthey abound; and these natural wants seem to offer fair ground of mutual\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe country between the Mississippi and Illinois on one side, and the\r\nOhio and Wabash on the other, is also peculiarly desirable to us, and\r\nis in a situation this moment which renders it particularly easy for\r\nus to acquire a considerable portion of it. It has belonged to the\r\nKaskaskias, Cahokias and Piorias. The Cahokias (of whom the Michiganris\r\nwere a part) have been anticipated by the Sacs, the Piorias driven off,\r\nand the Kaskaskias decreased to a few families. Governor Harrison, in\r\nhis letter of November 28th, 1802, says the Pioria chief has offered\r\nthe right of his nation to these lands for a trifle. We should not fail\r\nto purchase it immediately. The Cahokias being extirpated, we have a\r\nright to their lands in preference to any Indian tribe, in virtue of our\r\npermanent sovereignty over it. He also says that Deloigne, the Kaskaskia\r\nchief, would make easy terms with us. I think we should be liberal in\r\nour offers to the Kaskaskians. They are now but a few families, exposed\r\nto numerous enemies, and unable to defend themselves, and would cede\r\nlands in exchange for protection. We might agree to their laying off\r\none hundred acres of the best soil for every person, young and old, of\r\ntheir tribe, we might enclose it well for them in one general inclosure,\r\ngive to every family utensils and stock sufficient for their portion\r\nof it, and give them an annuity in necessaries, on their ceding to us\r\ntheir whole country, on retaining for themselves only a moderate range\r\naround their farms for their stock to range in; and we might undertake\r\nto protect them from their enemies. Having thus established ourselves\r\nin the rights of the Kaskaskias, Cahokias and Piorias, we should have to\r\nsettle the boundaries between them and the Kickapoos, Powtawatamies and\r\nWeaws. We should press again the good will of these tribes by friendly\r\nacts, and of their chiefs by largesses, and then propose to run the line\r\nbetween us, to claim whatever can be said to be doubtful, offering them\r\na liberal price for their pretensions, and even endeavoring to obtain\r\nfrom them a cession of so much of their acknowledged territory as they\r\ncan be induced to part with.\r\n\r\nAs to the country on the Mississippi above the mouth of the Illinois,\r\nits acquisition is not pressing in the present state of things. It might\r\nbe well to be inquiring into titles, and to claim whatever may have\r\nbeen abandoned or lost by its native owners, so as to prevent usurpation\r\nby tribes having no right; as also to purchase such portions as may be\r\nfound in the occupation of small remnants of tribes nearly extinct and\r\ndisposed to emigrate.\r\n\r\nFor the present, it is submitted to the consideration of the Secretary\r\nof War, whether instructions should not be immediately given to Governor\r\nHarrison to treat with the Piorias and Kaskaskias chiefs; as to the\r\nlatter, which is most important, it would be easy to solicit and bring\r\nover by presents every individual of mature age.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Notes on the subject of the consular convention between the United\r\nStates and France. May 3d, 1803._\r\n\r\nIn 1784 a convention was entered into between Dr. Franklin and the Count\r\nde Vergennes concerning consuls. It contained many things absolutely\r\ninadmissible by the laws of the several States, and inconsistent with\r\ntheir genius and character. Dr. Franklin, not being a lawyer, and\r\nthe project offered by the Count de Vergennes being a copy of the\r\nconventions which were established between France and the despotic\r\nStates on the continent (for with England they never had one), he seems\r\nto have supposed it a formula established by universal experience, and\r\nnot to have suspected that it might contain matters inconsistent with\r\nthe principles of a free people. He returned to America soon after the\r\nsignature of it. Congress received it with the deepest concern. They\r\nhonored Dr. Franklin, they were attached to the French nation; but they\r\ncould not relinquish fundamental principles. They declined ratifying it,\r\nand sent it back with new powers and instructions to Mr. Jefferson, who\r\nsucceeded Dr. Franklin at Paris. The most objectionable matters were\r\nthe privileges and exemptions given to the consuls, and their powers\r\nover persons of the nation, establishing a jurisdiction independent\r\nof that of the nation in which it was exercised, and uncontrollable by\r\nit. The French government valued these, because they then apprehended a\r\nvery extensive emigration from France to the United States, which this\r\nconvention enabled them to control. It was, therefore, with the utmost\r\nreluctance, and inch by inch, that they could be induced to relinquish\r\nthese conditions. The following changes, however, were effected by the\r\nconvention of 1788:\r\n\r\nThe clauses of the convention of 1784, clothing consuls with the\r\nprivileges of the laws of nations, were struck out, and they were\r\nexpressly subjected, in their persons and property, to the laws of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe giving the right of sanctuary to their houses, was reduced to a\r\nprotection of their chancery room and its papers.\r\n\r\nTheir coercive powers over passengers were taken away; and those whom\r\nthey might have termed deserters of their nation, were restrained to\r\ndeserted seamen only.\r\n\r\nThe clause allowing them to arrest and send back vessels, was struck\r\nout, and instead of it they were allowed to exercise a police over the\r\nships of their nation generally.\r\n\r\nSo was that which declared the indelibility of the character of subject,\r\nand the explanation and extension of the eleventh article of the treaty\r\nof amity.\r\n\r\nThe innovations in the laws of evidence were done away; and the\r\nconvention, from being perpetual, was limited to twelve years.\r\n\r\nAlthough strong endeavors were made to do away some other disagreeable\r\narticles, yet it was found that more could not be done without disturbing\r\nthe good humor which Congress wished so much to preserve, and the\r\nlimitation obtained for the continuance of the constitution insured our\r\ngetting finally rid of the whole. Congress, therefore, satisfied with\r\nhaving so far amended their situation, ratified the convention of 1788\r\nwithout hesitation.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Wingate.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.\r\n\r\n_Resolutions relative to the alien and sedition laws._[20]\r\n\r\n1. _Resolved_, That the several States composing the United States of\r\nAmerica, are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to\r\ntheir general government; but that, by a compact under the style and\r\ntitle of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto,\r\nthey constituted a general government for special purposes,--delegated\r\nto that government certain definite powers, reserving, each State to\r\nitself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and\r\nthat whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its\r\nacts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force: that to this compact\r\neach State acceded as a State, and is an integral party, its co-States\r\nforming, as to itself, the other party: that the government created by\r\nthis compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of\r\nthe powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion,\r\nand not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all\r\nother cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party\r\nhas an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of\r\nthe mode and measure of redress.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That the Constitution of the United States, having\r\ndelegated to Congress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the\r\nsecurities and current coin of the United States, piracies, and felonies\r\ncommitted on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations, and\r\nno other crimes whatsoever; and it being true as a general principle,\r\nand one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that\r\n\"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,\r\nor to the people,\" therefore the act of Congress, passed on the 14th day\r\nof July, 1798, and intituled \"An Act in addition to the act intituled An\r\nAct for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,\" as\r\nalso the act passed by them on the ---- day of June, 1798, intituled \"An\r\nAct to punish frauds committed on the bank of the United States,\" (and\r\nall their other acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes,\r\nother than those so enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether\r\nvoid, and of no force; and that the power to create, define, and punish\r\nsuch other crimes is reserved, and, of right, appertains solely and\r\nexclusively to the respective States, each within its own territory.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That it is true as a general principle, and is also\r\nexpressly declared by one of the amendments to the Constitution, that\r\n\"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,\r\nor to the people;\" and that no power over the freedom of religion, freedom\r\nof speech, or freedom of the press being delegated to the United States\r\nby the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, all lawful\r\npowers respecting the same did of right remain, and were reserved to the\r\nStates or the people: that thus was manifested their determination to\r\nretain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of\r\nspeech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful\r\nfreedom, and how far those abuses which cannot be separated from their\r\nuse should be tolerated, rather than the use be destroyed. And thus\r\nalso they guarded against all abridgment by the United States of the\r\nfreedom of religious opinions and exercises, and retained to themselves\r\nthe right of protecting the same, as this State, by a law passed on\r\nthe general demand of its citizens, had already protected them from all\r\nhuman restraint or interference. And that in addition to this general\r\nprinciple and express declaration, another and more special provision has\r\nbeen made by one of the amendments to the Constitution, which expressly\r\ndeclares, that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment\r\nof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging\r\nthe freedom of speech or of the press:\" thereby guarding in the same\r\nsentence, and under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,\r\nand of the press: insomuch, that whatever violated either, throws down\r\nthe sanctuary which covers the others, and that libels, falsehood, and\r\ndefamation, equally with heresy and false religion, are withheld from the\r\ncognizance of federal tribunals. That, therefore, the act of Congress\r\nof the United States, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, intituled\r\n\"An Act in addition to the act intituled An Act for the punishment of\r\ncertain crimes against the United States,\" which does abridge the freedom\r\nof the press, is not law, but is altogether void, and of no force.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That alien friends are under the jurisdiction and\r\nprotection of the laws of the State wherein they are: that no power\r\nover them has been delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to\r\nthe individual States, distinct from their power over citizens. And\r\nit being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the\r\nConstitution having also declared, that \"the powers not delegated to the\r\nUnited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,\r\nare reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,\" the act of\r\nthe Congress of the United States, passed on the -- day of July, 1798,\r\nintituled \"An Act concerning aliens,\" which assumes powers over alien\r\nfriends, not delegated by the Constitution, is not law, but is altogether\r\nvoid, and of no force.\r\n\r\n5. _Resolved_, That in addition to the general principle, as well as\r\nthe express declaration, that powers not delegated are reserved, another\r\nand more special provision, inserted in the Constitution from abundant\r\ncaution, has declared that \"the migration or importation of such persons\r\nas any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall\r\nnot be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808:\" that this\r\ncommonwealth does admit the migration of alien friends, described as\r\nthe subject of the said act concerning aliens: that a provision against\r\nprohibiting their migration, is a provision against all acts equivalent\r\nthereto, or it would be nugatory: that to remove them when migrated,\r\nis equivalent to a prohibition of their migration, and is, therefore,\r\ncontrary to the said provision of the Constitution, and void.\r\n\r\n6. _Resolved_, That the imprisonment of a person under the protection of\r\nthe laws of this commonwealth, on his failure to obey the simple _order_\r\nof the President to depart out of the United States, as is undertaken\r\nby said act intituled \"An Act concerning aliens,\" is contrary to the\r\nConstitution, one amendment to which has provided that \"no person shall\r\nbe deprived of liberty without due progress of law;\" and that another\r\nhaving provided that \"in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall\r\nenjoy the right to public trial by an impartial jury, to be informed\r\nof the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the\r\nwitnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses\r\nin his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence,\"\r\nthe same act, undertaking to authorize the President to remove a person\r\nout of the United States, who is under the protection of the law, on\r\nhis own suspicion, without accusation, without jury, without public\r\ntrial, without confrontation of the witnesses against him, without\r\nhearing witnesses in his favor, without defence, without counsel, is\r\ncontrary to the provision also of the Constitution, is therefore not\r\nlaw, but utterly void, and of no force: that transferring the power of\r\njudging any person, who is under the protection of the laws, from the\r\ncourts to the President of the United States, as is undertaken by the\r\nsame act concerning aliens, is against the article of the Constitution\r\nwhich provides that \"the judicial power of the United States shall be\r\nvested in courts, the judges of which shall hold their offices during\r\ngood behavior;\" and that the said act is void for that reason also. And\r\nit is further to be noted, that this transfer of judiciary power is to\r\nthat magistrate of the general government who already possesses all the\r\nExecutive, and a negative on all Legislative powers.\r\n\r\n7. _Resolved_, That the construction applied by the General Government\r\n(as is evidenced by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts of the\r\nConstitution of the United States which delegate to Congress a power \"to\r\nlay and collect taxes, duties, imports, and excises, to pay the debts,\r\nand provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United\r\nStates,\" and \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution in\r\nthe government of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof,\" goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to their power\r\nby the Constitution: that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary\r\nonly to the execution of limited powers, ought not to be so construed\r\nas themselves to give unlimited powers, nor a part to be so taken as\r\nto destroy the whole residue of that instrument: that the proceedings\r\nof the General Government under color of these articles, will be a fit\r\nand necessary subject of revisal and correction, at a time of greater\r\ntranquillity, while those specified in the preceding resolutions call\r\nfor immediate redress.\r\n\r\n8th. _Resolved_, That a committee of conference and correspondence\r\nbe appointed, who shall have in charge to communicate the preceding\r\nresolutions to the Legislatures of the several States; to assure them\r\nthat this commonwealth continues in the same esteem of their friendship\r\nand union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common\r\ndanger first suggested a common union: that it considers union, for\r\nspecified national purposes, and particularly to those specified in\r\ntheir late federal compact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness and\r\nprosperity of all the States: that faithful to that compact, according\r\nto the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded\r\nto by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its preservation:\r\nthat it does also believe, that to take from the States all the powers\r\nof self-government and transfer them to a general and consolidated\r\ngovernment, without regard to the special delegations and reservations\r\nsolemnly agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness\r\nor prosperity of these States; and that therefore this commonwealth is\r\ndetermined, as it doubts not its co-States are, to submit to undelegated,\r\nand consequently unlimited powers in no man, or body of men on earth: that\r\nin cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general\r\ngovernment, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would\r\nbe the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have\r\nnot been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy:\r\nthat every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact,\r\n(casus non fœderis,) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions\r\nof power by others within their limits: that without this right, they\r\nwould be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever\r\nmight exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless, this\r\ncommonwealth, from motives of regard and respect for its co-States, has\r\nwished to communicate with them on the subject: that with them alone it\r\nis proper to communicate, they alone being parties to the compact, and\r\nsolely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised\r\nunder it, Congress being not a party, but merely the creature of the\r\ncompact, and subject as to its assumptions of power to the final judgment\r\nof those by whom, and for whose use itself and its powers were all\r\ncreated and modified: that if the acts before specified should stand,\r\nthese conclusions would flow from them; that the general government\r\nmay place any act they think proper on the list of crimes, and punish\r\nit themselves whether enumerated or not enumerated by the constitution\r\nas cognizable by them: that they may transfer its cognizance to the\r\nPresident, or any other person, who may himself be the accuser, counsel,\r\njudge and jury, whose _suspicions_ may be the evidence, his _order_ the\r\nsentence, his _officer_ the executioner, and his breast the sole record\r\nof the transaction: that a very numerous and valuable description of\r\nthe inhabitants of these States being, by this precedent, reduced, as\r\noutlaws, to the absolute dominion of one man, and the barrier of the\r\nConstitution thus swept away from us all, no rampart now remains against\r\nthe passions and the powers of a majority in Congress to protect from\r\na like exportation, or other more grievous punishment, the minority of\r\nthe same body, the legislatures, judges, governors and counsellors of\r\nthe States, nor their other peaceable inhabitants, who may venture to\r\nreclaim the constitutional rights and liberties of the States and people,\r\nor who for other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious to the views,\r\nor marked by the suspicions of the President, or be thought dangerous\r\nto his or their election, or other interests, public or personal: that\r\nthe friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of\r\na first experiment; but the citizen will soon follow, or rather, has\r\nalready followed, for already has a sedition act marked him as its prey:\r\nthat these and successive acts of the same character, unless arrested\r\nat the threshold, necessarily drive these States into revolution and\r\nblood, and will furnish new calumnies against republican government,\r\nand new pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that man cannot\r\nbe governed but by a rod of iron: that it would be a dangerous delusion\r\nwere a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for\r\nthe safety of our rights: that confidence is everywhere the parent of\r\ndespotism--free government is founded in jealousy, and not in confidence;\r\nit is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions,\r\nto bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power: that our\r\nConstitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which, and no further,\r\nour confidence may go; and let the honest advocate of confidence read the\r\nAlien and Sedition acts, and say if the Constitution has not been wise\r\nin fixing limits to the government it created, and whether we should be\r\nwise in destroying those limits. Let him say what the government is, if\r\nit be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice have conferred on our\r\nPresident, and the President of our choice has assented to, and accepted\r\nover the friendly strangers to whom the mild spirit of our country and\r\nits laws have pledged hospitality and protection: that the men of our\r\nchoice have more respected the bare _suspicions_ of the President, than\r\nthe solid right of innocence, the claims of justification, the sacred\r\nforce of truth, and the forms and substance of law and justice. In\r\nquestions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but\r\nbind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution. That this\r\ncommonwealth does therefore call on its co-States for an expression of\r\ntheir sentiments on the acts concerning aliens, and for the punishment of\r\ncertain crimes herein before specified, plainly declaring whether these\r\nacts are or are not authorized by the federal compact. And it doubts\r\nnot that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment\r\nunaltered to limited government, whether general or particular. And that\r\nthe rights and liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dangers\r\nby remaining embarked in a common bottom with their own. That they will\r\nconcur with this commonwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably\r\nagainst the Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration\r\nthat that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the\r\nGeneral Government, but that it will proceed in the exercise over these\r\nStates, of all powers whatsoever: that they will view this as seizing the\r\nrights of the States, and consolidating them in the hands of the General\r\nGovernment, with a power assumed to bind the States, (not merely as the\r\ncases made federal, (casus fœderis,) but) in all cases whatsoever, by\r\nlaws made, not with their consent, but by others against their consent:\r\nthat this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen,\r\nand live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and not from\r\nour authority; and that the co-States, recurring to their natural right\r\nin cases not made federal, will concur in declaring these acts void, and\r\nof no force, and will each take measures of its own for providing that\r\nneither these acts, nor any others of the General Government not plainly\r\nand intentionally authorized by the Constitution, shall be exercised\r\nwithin their respective territories.\r\n\r\n9th, _Resolved_, That the said committee be authorized to communicate by\r\nwriting or personal conferences, at any times or places whatever, with\r\nany person or persons who may be appointed by any one or more co-States\r\nto correspond or confer with them; and that they lay their proceedings\r\nbefore the next session of Assembly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [20] [Two copies of these resolutions are preserved among\r\n     the manuscripts of the author, both in his own handwriting.\r\n     One is a rough draught, and the other very neatly and\r\n     carefully prepared. The probability is, that they are the\r\n     original of the celebrated Kentucky Resolutions on the\r\n     same subject.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Stevens' case._[21] _June 12th, 1804._\r\n\r\nI consider the annual act which appropriates a given sum to the expenses\r\nof intercourse with foreign nations, as a sufficient authority to the\r\nPresident (the constitutional organ of foreign intercourse) to expend\r\nthat sum for the purposes of foreign intercourse at his discretion. If\r\nhe abuses that discretion, he is responsible for it in a constitutional\r\nway. The legal restrictions on this power are, 1. That for outfit or\r\ncompensation for personal services and expenses to certain specified\r\ngrades (which are those chiefly used by the United States), not more than\r\nspecified sums shall be allowed. 2. That the whole expenses shall not\r\nexceed the sum appropriated. 3. That an account of the expenditure shall\r\nbe rendered. The sum on which these restrictions leave the executive\r\ndiscretion to act, is too small to excite any rational jealousy, or\r\nto render it useful to restrict it further by rigorous and unusual\r\nconstructions. The executive, therefore, is believed to be free to make\r\nallowance to the specified grades for any object than those (for personal\r\nservices and expenses), and to employ any unspecified grade on such\r\nsalary and allowance as he thinks proper within the limits of the whole\r\nappropriation. Nor is any law, or principle of law known, which would\r\nforbid the superadding these agencies and allowances for them to the\r\nordinary functions of a court minister, &c. I consider the appointment,\r\ntherefore, and allowance to Dr. Stevens to have been within the limits\r\nof the Executive authority.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is agreed between two parties that certain services shall\r\nbe performed by the one for the other, and no special compensation is\r\nstipulated, the law understands their intention to be that a _quantum\r\nmeruit_, or a reasonable compensation shall be allowed. Such an agreement\r\nwill therefore be implied by law in the case of Dr. Stevens. What is\r\nthat reasonable compensation? Not his expenses, however extravagant,\r\neven if a contract could be proved that his expenses were to be paid.\r\nThe law understands such a promise to mean his reasonable expenses only.\r\nHis functions were in a certain degree of a diplomatic nature. Yet the\r\ngovernment to which he was sent, not being independent, he could not be\r\ninvested formally with any diplomatic grade. If we place him, therefore,\r\non the level of the lowest grade, that of a chargé des affaires, and make\r\nthat the measure of his _quantum meruit_, we shall do him full justice.\r\nNo circumstance justifies his assuming a higher place.\r\n\r\nBut shall he be considered as a permanent agent, and therefore entitled\r\nto an outfit, or only as an occasional one to be allowed the reasonable\r\nexpenses of his passage, which is the rule with occasional diplomatic\r\nagents? His not having been nominated to the Senate clearly excludes him\r\nfrom the character of a permanent agent, if it does not take from him\r\nall legal character after their first session following his appointment.\r\nTo draw such a line as will admit the Executive, during the recess of\r\nthe Senate, to despatch a special agent for a particular purpose without\r\nawaiting their approbation, and yet not enable him, by continuing that\r\nagent permanently, to evade the constitutional approbation of the Senate,\r\nand to keep up a separate corps of diplomacy of his own, will require\r\ngreat consideration, caution and candor, and until it be done, great\r\nattention in the Executive to keep within unquestionable bounds. I do\r\nnot think, however, that the right of Dr. Stevens ought to depend on\r\nthat definition. An individual who is employed by the highest public\r\nfunctionary to do a public service within the line of his authority, is\r\nbound to consider him as acting with legal powers, and as alone charged\r\nwith all the responsibility if he transcends his powers. Dr. Stevens\r\nhad a right to expect the Executive would nominate him to the Senate\r\nfor approbation, if that nomination was necessary. He proceeds in his\r\nduty, and supposes the Executive does the same, and ought not to lose\r\nhis right by the failure of the latter. The public in such case should\r\npay the individual, and take on themselves the measures necessary to\r\nprevent similar infractions of the Constitution in future.\r\n\r\nQuestions meriting great consideration, have been made as to the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence offered in support of Dr. Stevens' claims.\r\nThe settling by a _quantum meruit_, the claim (for personal services and\r\nexpenses) gets rid of this question so far. For that the services were\r\nperformed is notorious, and that it was by public authority, results from\r\nthe whole correspondence. It has been suspected, indeed, that there was\r\nno contract, nor any other reward intended than certain privileges of\r\ncommerce. But this is not the way the United States pay their servants.\r\nMonopolizing compensations are among the most fatal abuses which some\r\ngovernments practice from false economy. They are not the usage here,\r\nand if suggested, the _onus probandi_ is thrown on the party suggesting\r\nit. The law will presume a fair and usual contract, but not one which\r\nis improper and unusual.\r\n\r\nThe claim for travelling expenses within the limits of his agency, would\r\nrequire proof of positive contract. When an agent for a limited district,\r\nis sent into another, his expenses have been usually allowed; but never\r\nthose of travelling to and from places within his regular care, and for\r\nthe regular purposes of that care. His general allowance compensates\r\nhis general superintendence over the whole, and to pay him for visiting\r\neach particular part also, would be a double payment. This would lead\r\nto endless claims and difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe hire of despatch vessels has been attended with such singular\r\ncircumstances as excite almost invincible suspicion that they came on\r\nthe ordinary business of the mercantile house. This means of conveying\r\ninformation is so expensive, that it is not allowed even to diplomatic\r\nagencies, but on great and important emergencies, on each of which as it\r\narises, the Department of State will decide, at the risk of the agent\r\nventuring on it. Whether these despatch vessels came purely on public\r\naccount, and whether the matter they were charged with justified the\r\nexpense, should be strictly inquired into.\r\n\r\nInquiry will doubtless also be made, 1, whether Mr. Yard's connection\r\nin interest with Dr. Stevens will admit him to be a witness in this\r\ncase; and 2, if it does, his testimony will be estimated, as every other\r\nman's is which is given under circumstances of bias of which he is not\r\nsensible himself.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on these questions of evidence, we are bound to proceed\r\nby the same laws of evidence which govern the courts of justice. These\r\nare the laws of the land, admitting no exceptions of person, public or\r\nprivate. The laws in refusing an appeal to the ordinary tribunals in\r\nquestions between an individual and the public, and leaving the decision\r\nin the executive department, has changed the judge in this instance,\r\nbut not the law. It has given judiciary but not legislative powers; and\r\nthe laws of the land are the inheritance and the right of every man,\r\nbefore whatever tribunal he is brought. For instance, that a contract\r\nneed not be on record; that it may be by parol as well as in writing,\r\nthat a written contract may be controlled by verbal agreement or other\r\nintrinsic matter, are principles of law to which Dr. Stevens is entitled\r\non the one hand, as it is our duty, on the other, to bring his claims\r\nto the test of law, to sift the facts on which they rest by the common\r\nrules of evidence, and to decide according to these on every item of his\r\naccounts, not weakly to relieve an individual by giving him the public\r\nmoney, nor arbitrarily to withhold by public power what is justly due to\r\nan individual. This investigation cannot be better trusted than to the\r\njustice and judgment of the comptroller, to whom therefore it is referred.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [21]\r\n                                               June 12th, 1804.\r\n\r\n     MR. GALLATIN,--On the subject of Dr. Stevens' case, I had,\r\n     before receiving your letter, endeavored to form as correct\r\n     a judgment as I could, and had made some notes, keeping\r\n     them open till I might see whether anything further should\r\n     be added. I have this morning put them into some form.\r\n     Of the purity of the motives of your objections, it was\r\n     impossible I should ever entertain a moment's doubt. Of\r\n     my opinion of their solidity, you will see a proof in the\r\n     conclusions I have drawn, and which will probably condemn\r\n     more than the half of Dr. Stevens' claims. I enclose you a\r\n     copy of my opinion on the subject, which may serve as the\r\n     direction of the Department of State to the comptroller.\r\n     Accept my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI.\r\n\r\n_Notes on a Draught for a second Inaugural Address._\r\n\r\nThe former one was an exposition of the principles on which I thought\r\nit my duty to administer the government. The second, then, should\r\nnaturally be a _compte rendu_, or a statement of facts showing that I\r\nhave conformed to those principles. The former was _promise_: this is\r\n_performance_. Yet the nature of the occasion requires that detail should\r\nbe avoided; that the most prominent heads only should be selected, and\r\nthese placed in a strong light, but in as few words as possible. These\r\nheads are foreign affairs, domestic ditto, viz.: Taxes, Debts, Louisiana,\r\nReligion, Indians, the Press. None of these heads need any commentary\r\nbut that of Indians. This is a proper topic, not only to promote the\r\nwork of humanizing our citizens towards these people, but to conciliate\r\nto us the good opinion of Europe on the subject of the Indians. This,\r\nhowever, might have been done in half the compass it here occupies. But\r\nevery respecter of science, every friend to political reformation, must\r\nhave observed with indignation the hue and cry raised against philosophy\r\nand the rights of man; and it really seems as if they would be overborne,\r\nand barbarism, bigotry, and despotism, would recover the ground they\r\nhave lost by the advance of the public understanding. I have thought the\r\noccasion justified some discountenance of these anti-social doctrines,\r\nsome testimony against them. But not to commit myself in direct warfare\r\non them, I have thought it best to say what is directly applied to the\r\nIndians only, but admits by inference a more general extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.\r\n\r\n_Farewell Address to Th: Jefferson. President of the United States._\r\n\r\n[Agreed to by both Houses, Feb. 7, 1809.]\r\n\r\nSir,--The General Assembly of your native State cannot close their\r\nsession, without acknowledging your services in the office which you are\r\njust about to lay down, and bidding you a respectful and affectionate\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nWe have to thank you for the model of an administration conducted on\r\nthe purest principles of republicanism; for pomp and state laid aside;\r\npatronage discarded; internal taxes abolished; a host of superfluous\r\nofficers disbanded; the monarchic maxim \"that a national debt is a\r\nnational blessing,\" renounced, and more than thirty-three millions of\r\nour debt discharged; the native right to nearly one hundred millions\r\nof acres of our national domain extinguished; and, without the guilt or\r\ncalamities of conquest, a vast and fertile region added to our country,\r\nfar more extensive than her original possessions, bringing along with it\r\nthe Mississippi and the port of Orleans, the trade of the west to the\r\nPacific Ocean, and in the intrinsic value of the land itself, a source\r\nof permanent and almost inexhaustible revenue. These are points in your\r\nadministration which the historian will not fail to seize, to expand,\r\nand teach posterity to dwell upon with delight. Nor will he forget our\r\npeace with the civilized world, preserved through a season of uncommon\r\ndifficulty and trial; the good will cultivated with the unfortunate\r\naborigines of our country, and the civilization humanely extended among\r\nthem; the lesson taught the inhabitants of the coast of Barbary, that we\r\nhave the means of chastising their piratical encroachments, and awing them\r\ninto justice; and that theme, on which, above all others, the historic\r\ngenius will hang with rapture, the liberty of speech and of the press\r\npreserved inviolate, without which genius and science are given to man\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nIn the principles on which you have administered the government, we see\r\nonly the continuation and maturity of the same virtues and abilities,\r\nwhich drew upon you in your youth the resentment of Dunmore. From the\r\nfirst brilliant and happy moment of your resistance to foreign tyranny,\r\nuntil the present day, we mark with pleasure and with gratitude the same\r\nuniform, consistent character, the same warm and devoted attachment\r\nto liberty and the republic, the same Roman love of your country, her\r\nrights, her peace, her honor, her prosperity.\r\n\r\nHow blessed will be the retirement into which you are about to go! How\r\ndeservedly blessed will it be! For you carry with you the richest of all\r\nrewards, the recollection of a life well spent in the service of your\r\ncountry, and proofs the most decisive, of the love, the gratitude, the\r\nveneration of your countrymen.\r\n\r\nThat your retirement may be as happy as your life has been virtuous and\r\nuseful; that our youth may see in the blissful close of your days, an\r\nadditional inducement to form themselves on your model, is the devout and\r\nearnest prayer of your fellow citizens who compose the General Assembly\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII.\r\n\r\n_Notes on Fifth Volume of Marshall's Life of Washington._\r\n\r\nPage 2. _\"The practicability of perpetuating his authority,\" &c._ I\r\nam satisfied that General Washington had not a wish to perpetuate his\r\nauthority; but he who supposes it was practicable, had he wished it,\r\nknows nothing of the spirit of America, either of the people or of those\r\nwho possessed their confidence. There was indeed a cabal of the officers\r\nof the army who proposed to establish a monarchy and to propose it to\r\nGeneral Washington. He frowned indignantly at the proposition, [according\r\nto the information which got abroad,] and Rufus King and some few civil\r\ncharacters, chiefly [indeed, I believe, to a man] north of Maryland, who\r\njoined in this intrigue. But they never dared openly to avow it, knowing\r\nthat the spirit which had produced a change in the form of government\r\nwas alive to the preservation of it.\r\n\r\nPage 28. The member of Congress here alluded to was myself, and the\r\nextracts quoted, was part of a letter from myself in answer to one\r\nGeneral Washington wrote. (See both.) General Washington called on me at\r\nAnnapolis (where I then was as a member of Congress), on his way to the\r\nmeeting of the Cincinnati in Philadelphia. We had much conversation on the\r\ninstitution, which was chiefly an amplification of the sentiments in our\r\nletters, and, in conclusion, after I had stated to him the modifications\r\nwhich I thought might remove all jealousies, as well as dangers, and the\r\nparts which might still be retained, he appeared to make up his mind, and\r\nsaid: \"No! not a fibre of it must be retained--no half-way reformation\r\nwill suffice. If the thing be bad, it must be totally abolished.\" And\r\nhe declared his determination to use his utmost endeavors to have it\r\nentirely abolished. On his return from Philadelphia he called on me\r\nagain at Annapolis, and sat with me until a very late hour in the night,\r\ngiving me an account of what passed in their convention. The sum of it\r\nwas that he had exerted his whole influence in every way in his power\r\nto procure an abolition; that the opposition to it was extreme, and\r\nespecially from some of the younger members; but that after several days\r\nof struggle within doors and without, a general sentiment was obtained\r\nfor its entire abolition. Whether any vote had been taken on it or not,\r\nI do not remember; but his affirmation to me was, that within a few days\r\n(I think he said two or three) it would have been formally abolished.\r\nJust in that moment arrived Major L'Enfant, who had been sent to France\r\nto procure the Eagles, and to offer the order to the French officers who\r\nhad served in America. He brought the King's permission to his officers\r\nto accept it, the letters of thanks of these officers accepting it,\r\nletters of solicitation from other officers to obtain it, and the Eagles\r\nthemselves. The effect of all this on the minds of the members was to\r\nundo much of what had been done; to rekindle all the passions which had\r\nproduced the institution, and silence all the dictates of prudence, which\r\nhad been operating for its abolition. After this, the General said, the\r\nutmost that could be effected was the modification which took place, and\r\nwhich provided for its extinction with the death of the existing members.\r\nHe declined the Presidency, and, I think, Baron Steuben was appointed. I\r\nwent soon after to France. While there, M. de Munier, charged with that\r\npart of the Encyclopedie Methodique which relates to economy politique\r\nand diplomatique, called on me with the article of that dictionary,\r\n\"Etats Unis,\" which he had prepared ready for the press, and begged I\r\nwould revise it and make any notes on it which I should think necessary\r\ntowards rendering it correct. I furnished him most of the matter of his\r\nfifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and tenth sections of the article \"Etats\r\nUnis,\" with which, however, he intermixed some of his own. The ninth is\r\nthat which relates to the Cincinnati. On this subject, the section, as\r\nprepared by him, was an unjust and incorrect Philippic against General\r\nWashington and the American officers in general. I wrote a substitute\r\nfor it, which he adopted, but still retaining considerable of his own\r\nmatter, and interspersing it in various parts.\r\n\r\nPage 33. _\"In a government constituted,\" &c._ Here begins the artful\r\ncomplexion he has given to the two parties, Federal and Republican. In\r\ndescribing the first by their views and motives, he implies an opposition\r\nto those motives in their opponents which is totally untrue. The real\r\ndifference consisted in their different degrees of inclination to Monarchy\r\nor Republicanism. The Federalists wished for everything which would\r\napproach our new government to a Monarchy. The Republicans to preserve\r\nit essentially Republican. This was the true origin of the division,\r\nand remains still the essential principle of difference between the two\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV.\r\n\r\n_Scheme for a system of Agricultural Societies. March, 1811._\r\n\r\nSeveral persons, farmers and planters of the county of Albemarle, having,\r\nduring their visits and occasional meetings together, in conversations\r\non the subjects of their agricultural pursuits, received considerable\r\nbenefits from an intercommunication of their plans and processes in\r\nhusbandry, they have imagined that these benefits might be usefully\r\nextended by enlarging the field of communication so as to embrace the\r\nwhole dimensions of the State. Were practical and observing husbandmen\r\nin each county to form themselves into a society, commit to writing\r\nthemselves, or state in conversations at their meetings to be written\r\ndown by others, their practices and observations, their experiences\r\nand ideas, selections from these might be made from time to time by\r\nevery one for his own use, or by the society or a committee of it, for\r\nmore general purposes. By an interchange of these selections among the\r\nsocieties of the different counties, each might thus become possessed of\r\nthe useful ideas and processes of the whole; and every one adopt such\r\nof them as he should deem suitable to his own situation. Or to abridge\r\nthe labor of such multiplied correspondences, a central society might\r\nbe agreed on to which, as a common deposit, all the others should send\r\ntheir communications. The society thus honored by the general confidence,\r\nwould doubtless feel and fulfil the duty of selecting such papers as\r\nshould be worthy of entire communication, of extracting and digesting\r\nfrom others whatever might be useful, and of condensing their matter\r\nwithin such compass as might reconcile it to the reading, as well as to\r\nthe purchase of the great mass of practical men. Many circumstances would\r\nrecommend, for the central society, that which should be established in\r\nthe county of the seat of government. The necessary relations of every\r\ncounty with that would afford facilities for all the transmissions which\r\nshould take place between them. The annual meeting of the legislature at\r\nthat place, the individuals of which would most frequently be members of\r\ntheir county societies, would give opportunities of informal conferences\r\nwhich might promote a general and useful understanding among all the\r\nsocieties; and presses established there offer conveniences entirely\r\npeculiar to that situation.\r\n\r\nIn a country, of whose interests agriculture forms the basis, wherein the\r\nsum of productions is limited by the quantity of the labor it possesses,\r\nand not of its lands, a more judicious employment of that labor would be a\r\nclear addition of gain to individuals as well as to the nation, now lost\r\nto both by a want of skill and information in its direction. Every one\r\nmust have seen farms otherwise equal, the one producing the double of the\r\nother by the superior culture and management of its possessor; and every\r\none must have under his eye numerous examples of persons setting out in\r\nlife with no other possession than skill in agriculture, and speedily,\r\nby its sole exercise, acquire wealth and independence. To promote,\r\ntherefore, the diffusion of this skill, and thereby to procure, with the\r\nsame labor now employed, greater means of subsistence and of happiness\r\nto our fellow citizens, is the ultimate object of this Association; and\r\ntowards effecting it, we consider the following particulars among those\r\nmost worthy of the attention of the societies proposed.\r\n\r\n1st. And principally the cultivation of our primary staples of wheat,\r\ntobacco, and hemp, for market.\r\n\r\n2d. All subsidiary articles for the support of the farm, the food, the\r\nclothing and the comfort of the household, as Indian corn, rye, oats,\r\nbarley, buckwheat, millet, the family of peas and beans, the whole family\r\nof grasses, turnips, potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and other useful\r\nroots, cotton and flax, the garden and orchard.\r\n\r\n3d. The care and services of useful animals for the saddle or draught,\r\nfor food or clothing, and the destruction of noxious quadrupeds, fowls,\r\ninsects, and reptiles.\r\n\r\n4th. Rotations of crops, and the circumstances which should govern or\r\nvary them, according to the varieties of soil, climate, and markets, of\r\nour different counties.\r\n\r\n5th. Implements of husbandry and operations with them, among which\r\nthe plough and all its kindred instruments for dividing the soil,\r\nholds the first place, and the threshing machine an important one, the\r\nsimplification of which is a great desideratum. Successful examples,\r\ntoo, of improvement in the operations of these instruments would be\r\nan excitement to correct the slovenly and unproductive practices too\r\ngenerally prevalent.\r\n\r\n6th. Farm buildings and conveniences, inclosures, roads, fuel, timber.\r\n\r\n7th. Manures, plaster, green-dressings, fallows, and other means of\r\nameliorating the soil.\r\n\r\n8th. Calendars of works, showing how a given number of laborers and of\r\ndraught animals are to be employed every day in the year so as to perform\r\nwithin themselves, and in their due time, according to the usual course\r\nof seasons, all the operations of a farm of given size. This being\r\nessential to the proportioning the labor to the size of the farm.\r\n\r\n9th. A succinct report of the different practices of husbandry in the\r\ncounty, including the bad as well as the good, that those who follow the\r\nformer may read and see their own condemnation in the same page which\r\noffers better examples for their adoption. It is believed that a judicious\r\nexecution of this article alone, might nearly supersede every other duty\r\nof the society, inasmuch as it would present every good practice which\r\nhas occurred to the mind of any cultivator of the State for imitation,\r\nand every bad one for avoidance. And the choicest processes culled from\r\nevery farm, would compose a course probably near perfection.\r\n\r\n10th. The county communications being first digested in their respective\r\nsocieties, a methodical and compact digest and publication of these would\r\nbe the duty of the central society; and on the judicious performance of\r\nthis, would in a great degree depend the utility of the institutions,\r\nand extent of improvement flowing from them.\r\n\r\n11th. That we may not deter from becoming members, those practical and\r\nobserving husbandmen whose knowledge is the most valuable, and who are\r\nmostly to be found in that portion of citizens with whom the observance\r\nof economy is necessary, all duties of every kind should be performed\r\ngratis; and to defray the expenses of the central publication alone,\r\neach member should pay at the first stated meeting of his society in\r\nevery year, ---- dollars, for which he should be entitled to receive a\r\ncopy of the publication bound in boards.\r\n\r\n12th. The first association of ---- persons in any county notifying\r\nthemselves as constituted to the central society, should be received\r\nas the society of the county making a part of the general establishment\r\nhere proposed; but every county society should be free to adopt associate\r\nmembers, although residents of other counties, and to receive and avail\r\nthe institution of communications from persons not members, whether in\r\nor out of their county.\r\n\r\nWe are far from presuming to offer this organization and these principles\r\nof constitution as complete, and worthy the implicit adoption of other\r\nsocieties. They are suggested only as propositions for consideration\r\nand amendment, and we shall readily accede to any others more likely to\r\neffect the purposes we have in view. We know that agricultural societies\r\nare already established in some counties; but we are not informed of\r\ntheir particular constitutions. We request these to be admitted into\r\ntheir brotherhood, and to make with them parts of one great whole. We\r\nhave learned that such a society is formed or forming at the seat of our\r\ngovernment. We ask their affiliation, and give them our suffrage for the\r\nstation of central society. We promise to all our zealous co-operation in\r\npromoting the objects of the institution, and to contribute our mite in\r\nexchange for the more abundant information we shall receive from others.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes we now constitute ourselves an agricultural society\r\nof the county of Albemarle, and adopt as rules for present observance,\r\nthe principles before stated.\r\n\r\nOur further organization shall be a President, Secretary and Treasurer,\r\nto be chosen at the first stated meeting to be held in every year, by a\r\nmajority of the members present, provided those present be a majority of\r\nthe existing members, and to continue in office until another election\r\nshall be made.\r\n\r\nThere shall be four stated meetings in ever year, to wit: on the first\r\nMondays in January, April, July and October.\r\n\r\nThe place of meeting, and rules of the society, shall be established,\r\nrevoked or altered, and new members admitted, at any of the stated\r\nmeetings, by a majority of the attending members, if they be a majority\r\nof those present, not being less than one-fourth of the whole. And, lest\r\nthe powers given to the greater quorum of a majority of the whole, should\r\nat any time remain unexercised from insufficient attendance, the same\r\nmay be exercised by a resolution of the lesser quorum of one-fourth,\r\npassed at a stated meeting: provided it be confirmed at the next stated\r\nmeeting, by either a greater or lesser quorum, and in the meantime have\r\nno force.\r\n\r\nThose who for two whole years shall not have attended any stated meeting\r\nshall, _ipso facto_, cease to be members. And to ascertain at all times\r\nwho are the existing members, the names of those attending every meeting\r\nshall be regularly entered in the journals of the society.\r\n\r\nThe President shall preside at all meetings when present, and when\r\nabsent, a president _pro tempore_ may be appointed for that purpose _by\r\nthose present_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV.\r\n\r\n_Observations on the force and obligation of the common law in the\r\nUnited States, on the occasion of Hardin's case, in Kentucky. November\r\n11th, 1812._\r\n\r\nThe _common law of England_ is that system of law which was established\r\nin that country anterior to the Magna Charta, 9 H. 3, before which period\r\nno statutes are extant of record. It is used in contradistinction to\r\nthe term _statute law_, which comprehends all the laws passed by their\r\nParliament from the Magna Charta down to this day.\r\n\r\nThe term _common law_ is used also in contradistinction to the _chancery_,\r\nas when we speak of the doctrines or courts of the common law, the\r\ndoctrines or courts of chancery, and then include the _statute law_ also.\r\nIn which sense the term is used, must always depend on the subject matter.\r\n\r\nOn the settlement of the colonies now composing the United States, and\r\nthe establishment of a legislature in each of them, that legislature,\r\nin some cases, finding that the enacting a complete code of laws, which\r\nshould reach every transaction needing legislative regulation, would\r\nbe far beyond their time and abilities, adopted, by an express act of\r\ntheir own, the laws of England as they stood at that date, comprehending\r\nthe common law, statutes to that period, and the chancery law. In other\r\ncases, instead of adopting them by an express statute of their own, they\r\nconsidered themselves as having brought with them, and been, even on\r\ntheir passage, under the constant obligation of the laws of the mother\r\ncountry, and on their arrival they continued to practice them without\r\nany act of adoption, which practice or usage is evidence that there was\r\nan adoption by general consent. In the case of Connecticut, they did not\r\nadopt the common law of England at all as their basis, but declared by an\r\nact of their own, that the law of God, as it stood revealed in the Old\r\nand New Testament, should be the basis of their laws, to be subject to\r\nsuch alterations as they should make. In all the cases where the common\r\nlaw, or laws of England, were adopted either expressly or tacitly, the\r\nlegislatures held of course, and exercised the power of making additions\r\nand alterations.\r\n\r\nAs the different States were settled at very different periods, and\r\nthe adoption for each State was the laws of England as they stood at\r\nthe moment of the adoption by the State, it is evident that the system\r\nas adopted in 1607 by Virginia, was one thing, as by Pennsylvania was\r\nanother thing, as by Georgia, in 1759, was still a different one. And\r\nwhen to this is added the very diversified modifications of the adoptive\r\ncode, produced by the subsequent laws passed by the legislatures of the\r\ndifferent States, the system of common law in force in any one State on\r\nthe 24th of September, 1789, when Congress assumed the jurisdiction given\r\nthem by the Constitution, was very different from the systems in force\r\nat the same moment in the several other States: that in all of these the\r\ncommon law was in force by virtue of the adoption of the State, express\r\nor tacit, and that it was not in force in Connecticut, because they had\r\nnever adopted it.\r\n\r\nHaving settled, by way of preliminary, to what extent, and by what\r\nauthority, the common law of England is the law of each of the States,\r\nwe will proceed to consider how far, and by what authority, it is the\r\nlaw of the United States as a national government.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution, the General Government has jurisdiction in all cases\r\narising under the Constitution, under the (constitutional) laws of the\r\nUnited States, and under treaties; in all cases, too, of ambassadors,\r\nof admiralty jurisdiction, where the United States is a party, between\r\na State or its citizens, or another State or its citizens, or a foreign\r\nState or its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe General Government, then, had a right to take under their cognizance\r\nall these cases, and no others. This might have been done by Congress, by\r\npassing a complete code, assuming the whole field of their jurisdiction,\r\nand applying uniformly to every State, without any respect to the laws\r\nof that State. But, like the State legislatures, who had been placed\r\nbefore in a similar situation, they felt that it was a work of too much\r\ntime and difficulty to be undertaken. Observing, therefore, that (except\r\ncases of piracy and murder on the high seas) all the cases within their\r\njurisdiction must arise in some of the States, they declared by the act\r\nSept. 24, 1789, c. 20, § 34, \"That the laws of the several States, except\r\nwhere the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States shall\r\notherwise provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials\r\nat _common law_ in the courts of the United States in cases where they\r\napply.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, Congress adopt for each State the laws of that State; and\r\namong the laws so adopted were portions of the common law, greater or\r\nless in different States, and in force, not by any innate authority of\r\nits own, but by the adoption or enacting of it by the State authority.\r\n\r\nNow what was the opinion to which this was opposed? Several judges\r\nof the General Government declared that \"the common law of England is\r\nthe unwritten law of the United States in their national and federal\r\ncapacity.\" A State judge, in a printed work, lays it down as \"certainly\r\nwrong to say that the judiciary power of the nation can exercise no\r\nauthority but what depends for its principle on acts of the national\r\nlegislature.\" And then quoting the preamble to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, which says that its object is \"to insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, promote the general welfare,\" &c., he adds, that \"what\r\nis here expressed is the _common law_ of the whole country,\" and that\r\n\"whatever is in opposition to it, whether treason, insurrection, sedition,\r\nmurder, riot, assaults, batteries, thefts or robberies, may be punished\r\nas crimes, independent of any act of Congress.\" And opinions equivalent\r\nto this were declared by one party on the floor of Congress. This is\r\nthe doctrine which the republicans declared heretical. They deny that\r\nCongress can pass any law not authorized by the Constitution, and that\r\nthe judges can act on any law not authorized by Congress, or by the\r\nConstitution in very direct terms.\r\n\r\nIf the true doctrine then be, that certain portions of the common and\r\nstatute law of England be in force in the different States by virtue of\r\nthe adoption of that State, and in the federal courts of the same State\r\nby virtue of the adoption by Congress of the laws of that State within\r\nits limits, then whenever a case is presented to a federal court, they\r\nare to ask themselves the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is this case within any of the definitions of jurisdiction given by\r\nthe Constitution to the General Government? If it be decided that it\r\nis, then\r\n\r\n2. Has Congress by any positive statute assumed cognizance of this case\r\nas permitted them by the Constitution? To determine this question, the\r\njudge must first look into the statutes of Congress generally; if he\r\nfinds it not there, he must look into the laws of the State, as well as\r\nthat portion of the English code which the State may have adopted, as\r\nthe acts passed specially by the legislature. If the case be actually\r\nfound provided for in these laws, another question still remains, viz.:\r\n\r\n3. Is the law of the State applicable to the analogous case of the\r\nGeneral Government? for it may happen that a law of the State, adapted\r\nperfectly to its own organization and local circumstances, may not\r\ntally with the different organization or circumstances of the federal\r\ngovernment. If the difference be such as to defeat the application,\r\nit must be considered as a case unprovided for by Congress, and not\r\ncognizable in their courts. Just so parts of the common or statute law\r\nof England are found by the State judges inapplicable to their State\r\nfrom a difference of circumstance. These differences of circumstance\r\nwill be shaded off from nothing to direct inconsistence, and it will be\r\nonly by many decisions on a great variety of cases that the line will\r\nat length be drawn.\r\n\r\nLet us apply these questions to Hardin's case, which is simply this:\r\nCongress, by an express statute, 1802, c. 13, § 6, have made the murder\r\nof an Indian within the territory of the United States punishable by\r\ndeath. A murder is committed on an Indian in that territory. The murderers\r\nfly to Kentucky. They are demanded by the Governor of Indiana of the\r\nGovernor of Kentucky; under whose authority our officer attempting to\r\ntake them, they are protected by Hardin and others in arms.\r\n\r\n1. Is this case within the jurisdiction of Congress? _Answer._ Congress\r\nhaving a right \"to make all rules and regulations respecting the territory\r\nof the United States,\" have declared this to be a case of murder. As\r\nthey can \"make all laws necessary and proper for carrying their powers\r\ninto execution,\" they can make the protecting a murderer criminal in\r\nany part of the United States.\r\n\r\n2. Has Congress assumed cognizance of the offence of Hardin? We must\r\nfirst examine whether the act of Congress, 1790, c. 9, § 22, takes in\r\nthis offence. Then whether the laws of Kentucky, common, statute, or\r\nState law, as adopted by Congress, comprehend this offence.\r\n\r\n3. Whether any difference of organization or other circumstance renders\r\nthe law of Kentucky inapplicable to this offence, can be decided by\r\nthose only who are particularly acquainted with that law.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI.\r\n\r\n_Plan for Elementary Schools._\r\n\r\n                                             POPLAR FOREST, Sept 9th, 1817.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I promised you that I would put into the form of a bill my\r\nplan of establishing the Elementary Schools, without taking a cent from\r\nthe Literary fund. I have had leisure at this place, to do this, and now\r\nsend you the result. If twelve or fifteen hundred schools are to be placed\r\nunder one general administration, an attention so divided will amount\r\nto a dereliction of them to themselves. It is surely better, then, to\r\nplace each school at once under the care of those most interested in its\r\nconduct. In this way the Literary fund is left untouched to complete at\r\nonce the whole system of education, by establishing a college in every\r\ndistrict of about eighty miles square, for the second grade of education,\r\nto wit: languages, ancient and modern, and for the third grade a single\r\nUniversity, in which the sciences shall be taught in their highest degree.\r\n\r\nI should apologize, perhaps, for the style of this bill. I dislike the\r\nverbose and intricate style of the English statutes, and in our revised\r\ncode I endeavored to restore it to the simple one of the ancient statutes,\r\nin such original bills as I drew in that work. I suppose the reformation\r\nhas not been acceptable, as it has been little followed. You, however,\r\ncan easily correct this bill to the taste of my brother lawyers, by\r\nmaking every other word a \"said\" or \"aforesaid,\" and saying everything\r\nover two or three times, so that nobody but we of the craft can untwist\r\nthe diction, and find out what it means; and that, too, not so plainly\r\nbut that we may conscientiously divide one half on each side. Mend it,\r\ntherefore, in form and substance to the orthodox taste, and make it what\r\nit should be; or, if you think it radically wrong, try something else,\r\nand let us make a beginning in some way. No matter how wrong, experience\r\nwill amend it as we go along, and make it effectual in the end.\r\n\r\nI shall see you of course at our stated visitation, and hope all the\r\ngentlemen will consider Monticello as the rendezvous of the preceding\r\nday or evening.\r\n\r\n                                  I salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _An Act for establishing Elementary Schools._\r\n\r\n1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, that at the first\r\nsession of the Superior Court in every county within this commonwealth,\r\nnext ensuing the passage of this act, the judge thereof shall appoint\r\nthree discreet and well-informed persons, residents of the county, and\r\nnot being ministers of the gospel[22] of any denomination, to serve\r\nas visitors of the Elementary Schools in the said county; of which\r\nappointment the sheriff shall, within fifteen days thereafter deliver a\r\ncertificate, under the hand of the clerk of the said court, to each of\r\nthe persons so appointed.\r\n\r\n2. The said visitors shall meet at the court-house of their county on\r\nthe first county court day after they shall have received notice of\r\ntheir appointment, and afterwards at such times and places as they, or\r\nany two of them, with reasonable notice to the third, shall have agreed;\r\nand shall proceed to divide their county into wards,[23] by metes and\r\nbounds so designated as to comprehend each, about the number of militia\r\nsufficient for a company, and so also as not to divide, and throw into\r\ndifferent wards[24] the lands of any one person held in one body; which\r\ndivision into wards shall, within six months from the date of their\r\nappointment, be completely designated, published, and reported, by their\r\nmetes and bounds, to the office of the clerk of the Superior Court,\r\nthere to be recorded, subject, however, to such alterations, from time\r\nto time afterwards, as changes of circumstances shall, in the opinion\r\nof the said visitors or their successors, with the approbation of the\r\nsaid court, render expedient.\r\n\r\n3. The original division into wards being made, the visitors shall\r\nappoint days for the first meeting of every ward, at such place as they\r\nshall name within the same, of which appointment notice shall be given\r\nat least two weeks before the day of meeting, by advertisement at some\r\npublic place within the ward, requiring every free, white male citizen,\r\nof full age, resident within the ward, to meet at the place, and by the\r\nhour of twelve of the day so appointed, at which meeting some one of the\r\nvisitors shall also attend, and a majority of the said warders being\r\nin attendance, the visitor present shall propose to them to decide by\r\na majority of their votes,--1. The location of a school-house for the\r\nward, and a dwelling-house for the teacher, (the owner of the ground\r\nconsenting thereto.) 2. The size and structure of the said houses; and\r\n3. Whether the same shall be built by the joint labor of the warders,\r\nor by their pecuniary contributions; and also 4. To elect by a plurality\r\nof their votes a warden, resident, who shall direct and superintend the\r\nsaid buildings, and be charged with their future care.\r\n\r\n4. And if they decide that the said buildings[25] shall be erected by\r\nthe joint labor of the warders, then all persons within the said ward\r\nliable to work in the highways, shall attend at the order of the warden,\r\nand, under his direction, shall labor thereon until completed, under\r\nthe same penalties as provided by law to enforce labor on the highways.\r\nAnd if they decide on erection by pecuniary contributions, the residents\r\nand owners of property within the ward shall contribute toward the cost,\r\neach in proportion to the taxes they last paid to the State for their\r\npersons and for the same property: of which the sheriff or commissioners\r\nshall furnish a statement to the warden, who, according to the ratio of\r\nthat statement, shall apportion and assess the quota of contribution\r\nfor each, and be authorized to demand, receive, and apply the same to\r\nthe purposes of the contribution, and to render account thereof, as in\r\nall other his pecuniary transactions for the school, to the visitors;\r\nand on failure of payment by any contributor, the sheriff, on the order\r\nof the warden, shall collect and render the same under like powers and\r\nregulations as provided for the collection of the public taxes. And\r\nin every case it shall be the duty of the warden to have the buildings\r\ncompleted within six months from the date of his election.\r\n\r\n5. It shall be the duty of the said visitors to seek and to employ for\r\nevery ward,[26] whenever the number and ages of its children require it,\r\na person of good moral character, qualified to teach reading, writing,\r\nnumeral arithmetic and geography, whose subsistence shall be furnished by\r\nthe residents and proprietors of the ward, either in money or in kind, at\r\nthe choice of each contributor, and in the ratio of their public taxes,\r\nto be apportioned and levied as on the failures before provided for. The\r\nteacher shall also have the use of the house and accommodations provided\r\nfor him, and shall moreover receive annually such standing wages as the\r\nvisitors shall have determined to be proportioned on the residents and\r\nproprietors of the ward, and to be paid, levied and applied as before\r\nprovided in other cases of pecuniary contribution. At this school shall\r\nbe received and instructed gratis, every infant of competent age who has\r\nnot already had three years schooling. And it is declared and enacted,\r\nthat no person unborn or under the age of twelve years at the passing\r\nof this act, and who is _compos mentis_, shall, after the age of fifteen\r\nyears, be a citizen of this commonwealth until he or she can read readily\r\nin some tongue, native or acquired.\r\n\r\n6. To keep up a constant succession of visitors, the judge of the Superior\r\nCourt of every county shall at his first session in every bissextile year,\r\nappoint visitors as before characterized, either the same or others, at\r\nhis discretion. And in case of the death or resignation of any visitor\r\nduring the term of his appointment, or of his removal by the said judge\r\nfor good cause, moral or physical, he shall appoint another to serve\r\nuntil the next bissextile appointment. Which visitors shall have their\r\nfirst meeting at their court house on the county court day next ensuing\r\ntheir appointment, and afterwards at such times and places as themselves\r\nor any two of them with reasonable notice to the third shall agree.\r\nBut the election of wardens shall be annually, at the first meeting of\r\nthe ward after the month of March, until which election the warden last\r\nelected shall continue in office.\r\n\r\n7. All ward meetings shall be at their school house, and on a failure\r\nof the meeting of a majority of the wardens on the call of a visitor,\r\nor of their warden, such visitor or warden may call another meeting.\r\n\r\n8. At all times when repairs or alterations of the buildings before\r\nprovided for shall be wanting, it shall be the duty of the warden or of\r\na visitor, to call a ward meeting and to take the same measures towards\r\nsuch repairs or alterations as are herein before authorized for the\r\noriginal buildings.\r\n\r\n9. When, on the application of any warden, authorized thereto by the\r\nvote of his ward, the judge of the Superior Court shall be of opinion\r\nthat the contributors of any particular ward are disproportionably\r\nand oppressively overburthened with an unusual number of children of\r\nnon-contributors of their ward, he may direct an order to the county\r\ncourt to assess in their next county levy the whole or such part of the\r\nextra burthen as he shall think excessive and unreasonable, to be paid\r\nto the warden for its proper use, to which order the said county court\r\nis required to conform.\r\n\r\n10. The said teachers shall, in all things relating to the education and\r\ngovernment of their pupils, be under the direction and control of the\r\nvisitors; but no religious reading, instruction or exercise, shall be\r\nprescribed or practiced inconsistent with the tenets of any religious\r\nsect or denomination.\r\n\r\n11. Some one of the visitors, once in every year at least, shall visit\r\nthe several schools: shall inquire into the proceedings and practices\r\nthereat: shall examine the progress of the pupils, and give to those\r\nwho excel in reading, in writing, in arithmetic, or in geography, such\r\nhonorary marks and testimonies of approbation, as may encourage and\r\nexcite to industry and emulation.\r\n\r\n12. All decisions and proceedings of the visitors relative to the original\r\ndesignation of wards at any time before the buildings are begun, or\r\nchanges of wards at any time after, to the quantum of subsistence, or\r\nwages allowed to the teacher, and to the rules prescribed to him for the\r\neducation and government of his pupils, shall be subject to be controlled\r\nand corrected by the judge of the Superior Court of the county, on the\r\ncomplaint of any individual aggrieved or interested.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [22] § 1. Ministers of the Gospel are excluded to avoid\r\n     jealousy from the other sects, were the public education\r\n     committed to the ministers of a particular one; and with\r\n     more reason than in the case of their exclusion from the\r\n     legislative and executive functions.\r\n\r\n     [23] § 2. This designation of the size of a ward is\r\n     founded on these considerations: 1st. That the population\r\n     which furnishes a company of militia will generally about\r\n     furnish children enough for a school. 2d. That in most\r\n     instances, at present, the militia captaincies being laid\r\n     off compactly by known and convenient metes and bounds, many\r\n     will be adopted without change, and others will furnish a\r\n     canvas to work on and to reform. 3d. That these wards once\r\n     established, will be found convenient and salutary aids\r\n     in the administration of government, of which they will\r\n     constitute the organic elements, and the first integral\r\n     members in the composition of the military.\r\n\r\n     [24] § 3. The prohibition to place among different wards\r\n     the lands of a single individual, held in a body is, 1st.\r\n     To save the proprietor from the perplexity of multiplied\r\n     responsibilities; and 2. To prevent arbitrary and inconsistent\r\n     apportionments, by different wardens, of the comparative\r\n     values of the different portions of his lands in their\r\n     respective wards.\r\n\r\n     [25] § 4. It is presumed that the wards will generally\r\n     build such log-houses for the school and teacher as they\r\n     now do, and will join force and build them themselves,\r\n     experience proving them to be as comfortable as they\r\n     are cheap. Nor would it be advisable to build expensive\r\n     houses in the country wards, which, from changes in their\r\n     population, will be liable to changes of their boundaries\r\n     and consequent displacements of their centre, drawing\r\n     with it a removal of their school-house. In towns, better\r\n     houses may be more safely built, or rented for both purposes.\r\n\r\n     [26] § 5. Estimating eight hundred militia to a county,\r\n     there will be twelve captaincies or wards in a county on\r\n     an average. Suppose each of these, three years in every\r\n     six, to have children enough for a school, who have not\r\n     yet had three years schooling; such a county will employ\r\n     six teachers, each serving two wards by alternate terms.\r\n     These teachers will be taken from the laboring classes, as\r\n     they are now, to wit: from that which furnishes mechanics,\r\n     overseers and tillers of the earth; and they will chiefly\r\n     be the cripples, the weakly and the old, of that class, who\r\n     will have been qualified for these functions by the ward\r\n     schools themselves. If put on a footing then, for wages and\r\n     subsistence, with the young and the able of their class,\r\n     they will be liberally compensated: say with one hundred\r\n     and fifty dollars wages and the usual allowance of meat\r\n     and bread. The subsistence will probably be contributed in\r\n     kind by the warders, out of their family stock. The wages\r\n     alone will be a pecuniary tax of about nine hundred dollars.\r\n     To a county, this addition would be of about one-fifth of\r\n     the taxes we now pay to the State, or about one-fifth of\r\n     one per cent, on every man's taxable property; if tax can\r\n     be called that which we give to our children in the most\r\n     valuable of all forms, that of instruction. Were those\r\n     schools to be established on the public funds, and to be\r\n     managed by the Governor and council, or the commissioners\r\n     of the Literary fund, brick houses to be built for the\r\n     schools and teachers, high wages and subsistence given\r\n     them, they would be badly managed, depraved by abuses,\r\n     and would exhaust the whole Literary fund. While under the\r\n     eye and animadversion of the wards, and the control of the\r\n     wardens and visitors, economy, diligence, and correctness\r\n     of conduct, will be enforced, the whole Literary fund will\r\n     be spared to complete the general system of education,\r\n     by colleges in every district for instruction in the\r\n     languages, and an university for the whole of the higher\r\n     sciences; and this, by an addition to our contributions\r\n     almost insensible, and which, in fact, will not be felt\r\n     as a burthen, because applied immediately and visibly to\r\n     the good of our children.\r\n\r\n     A question of some doubt might be raised on the latter\r\n     part of this section, as to the rights and duties of\r\n     society towards its members, infant and adult. Is it a\r\n     right or a duty in society to take care of their infant\r\n     members in opposition to the will of the parent? How far\r\n     does this right and duty extend?--to guard the life of\r\n     the infant, his property, his instruction, his morals?\r\n     The Roman father was supreme in all these: we draw a line,\r\n     but where?--public sentiment does not seem to have traced\r\n     it precisely. Nor is it necessary in the present case.\r\n     It is better to tolerate the rare instance of a parent\r\n     refusing to let his child be educated, than to shock the\r\n     common feelings and ideas by the forcible asportation and\r\n     education of the infant against the will of the father. What\r\n     is proposed here is to remove the objection of expense,\r\n     by offering education gratis, and to strengthen parental\r\n     excitement by the disfranchisement of his child while\r\n     uneducated. Society has certainly a right to disavow him\r\n     whom they offer, and are not permitted to qualify for the\r\n     duties of a citizen. If we do not force instruction, let\r\n     us at least strengthen the motives to receive it when offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII.\r\n\r\n_The solemn Declaration and Protest of the Commonwealth of Virginia,\r\non the principles of the Constitution of the United States of America,\r\nand on the violations of them._\r\n\r\nWe, the General Assembly of Virginia, on behalf, and in the name of the\r\npeople thereof, do declare as follows:\r\n\r\nThe States in North America which confederated to establish their\r\nindependence of the government of Great Britain, of which Virginia was\r\none, became, on that acquisition, free and independent States, and as\r\nsuch, authorized to constitute governments, each for itself, in such\r\nform as it thought best.\r\n\r\nThey entered into a compact, (which is called the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America,) by which they agreed to unite in a single\r\ngovernment as to their relations with each other, and with foreign\r\nnations, and as to certain other articles particularly specified. They\r\nretained at the same time, each to itself, the other rights of independent\r\ngovernment, comprehending mainly their domestic interests.\r\n\r\nFor the administration of their federal branch, they agreed to appoint,\r\nin conjunction, a distinct set of functionaries, legislative, executive,\r\nand judiciary, in the manner settled in that compact: while to each,\r\nseverally, and of course, remained its original right of appointing, each\r\nfor itself, a separate set of functionaries, legislative, executive,\r\nand judiciary, also, for administering the domestic branch of their\r\nrespective governments.\r\n\r\nThese two sets of officers, each independent of the other, constitute thus\r\na _whole_ of government, for each State separately; the powers ascribed\r\nto the one, as specifically made federal, exercised over the whole, the\r\nresiduary powers, retained to the other, exercisable exclusively over\r\nits particular State, foreign herein, each to the others, as they were\r\nbefore the original compact.\r\n\r\nTo this construction of government and distribution of its powers, the\r\ncommonwealth of Virginia does religiously and affectionately adhere,\r\nopposing, with equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpation of either\r\nset of functionaries on the rightful powers of the other.\r\n\r\nBut the federal branch has assumed in some cases, and claimed in others,\r\na right of enlarging its own powers by constructions, inferences, and\r\nindefinite deductions from those directly given, which this assembly\r\ndoes declare to be usurpations of the powers retained to the independent\r\nbranches, mere interpolations into the compact, and direct infractions\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThey claim, for example, and have commenced the exercise of a right to\r\nconstruct roads, open canals, and effect other internal improvements\r\nwithin the territories and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to the\r\nseveral States, which this assembly does declare has not been given to\r\nthat branch by the constitutional compact, but remains to each State\r\namong its domestic and unalienated powers, exercisable within itself\r\nand by its domestic authorities alone.\r\n\r\nThis assembly does further disavow and declare to be most false and\r\nunfounded, the doctrine that the compact, in authorizing its federal\r\nbranch to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises to pay\r\nthe debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the\r\nUnited States, has given them thereby a power to do whatever _they_ may\r\nthink, or pretend, would promote the general welfare, which construction\r\nwould make that, of itself, a complete government, without limitation\r\nof powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning were, that they\r\nmight levy the taxes necessary to provide for the general welfare, by\r\nthe various acts of power therein specified and delegated to them, and\r\nby no others.\r\n\r\nNor is it admitted, as has been said, that the people of these States, by\r\nnot investing their federal branch with all the means of bettering their\r\ncondition, have denied to themselves any which may effect that purpose;\r\nsince, in the distribution of these means they have given to that branch\r\nthose which belong to its department, and to the States have reserved\r\nseparately the residue which belong to them separately. And thus by the\r\norganization of the two branches taken together, have completely secured\r\nthe first object of human association, the full improvement of their\r\ncondition, and reserved to themselves all the faculties of multiplying\r\ntheir own blessings.\r\n\r\nWhilst the General Assembly thus declares the rights retained by the\r\nStates, rights which they have never yielded, and which this State\r\nwill never voluntarily yield, they do not mean to raise the banner of\r\ndisaffection, or of separation from their sister States, co-parties\r\nwith themselves to this compact. They know and value too highly the\r\nblessings of their Union as to foreign nations and questions arising\r\namong themselves, to consider every infraction as to be met by actual\r\nresistance. They respect too affectionately the opinions of those\r\npossessing the same rights under the same instrument, to make every\r\ndifference of construction a ground of immediate rupture. They would,\r\nindeed, consider such a rupture as among the greatest calamities which\r\ncould befall them; but not the greatest. There is yet one greater,\r\nsubmission to a government of unlimited powers. It is only when the\r\nhope of avoiding this shall become absolutely desperate, that further\r\nforbearance could not be indulged. Should a majority of the co-parties,\r\ntherefore, contrary to the expectation and hope of this assembly, prefer,\r\nat this time, acquiescence in these assumptions of power by the federal\r\nmember of the government, we will be patient and suffer much, under\r\nthe confidence that time, ere it be too late, will prove to them also\r\nthe bitter consequences in which that usurpation will involve us all.\r\nIn the meanwhile, we will breast with them, rather than separate from\r\nthem, every misfortune, save that only of living under a government of\r\nunlimited powers. We owe every other sacrifice to ourselves, to our\r\nfederal brethren, and to the world at large, to pursue with temper\r\nand perseverance the great experiment which shall prove that man is\r\ncapable of living in society, governing itself by laws self-imposed, and\r\nsecuring to its members the enjoyment of life, liberty, property, and\r\npeace; and further to show, that even when the government of its choice\r\nshall manifest a tendency to degeneracy, we are not at once to despair\r\nbut that the will and the watchfulness of its sounder parts will reform\r\nits aberrations, recall it to original and legitimate principles, and\r\nrestrain it within the rightful limits of self-government. And these\r\nare the objects of this Declaration and Protest.\r\n\r\nSupposing then, that it might be for the good of the whole, as some of\r\nits co-States seem to think, that the power of making roads and canals\r\nshould be added to those directly given to the federal branch, as more\r\nlikely to be systematically and beneficially directed, than by the\r\nindependent action of the several States, this commonwealth, from respect\r\nto these opinions, and a desire of conciliation with its co-States, will\r\nconsent, in concurrence with them, to make this addition, provided it be\r\ndone regularly by an amendment of the compact, in the way established by\r\nthat instrument, and provided also, it be sufficiently guarded against\r\nabuses, compromises, and corrupt practices, not only of possible, but\r\nof probable occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnd as a further pledge of the sincere and cordial attachment of this\r\ncommonwealth to the union of the whole, so far as has been consented\r\nto by the compact called \"The Constitution of the United States of\r\nAmerica,\" (constructed according to the plain and ordinary meaning\r\nof its language, to the common intendment of the time, and of those\r\nwho framed it;) to give also to all parties and authorities, time for\r\nreflection and for consideration, whether, under a temperate view of\r\nthe possible consequences, and especially of the constant obstructions\r\nwhich an equivocal majority must ever expect to meet, they will still\r\nprefer the assumption of this power rather than its acceptance from the\r\nfree will of their constituents; and to preserve peace in the meanwhile,\r\nwe proceed to make it the duty of our citizens, until the legislature\r\nshall otherwise and ultimately decide, to acquiesce under those acts\r\nof the federal branch of our government which we have declared to be\r\nusurpations, and against which, in point of right, we do protest as null\r\nand void, and never to be quoted as precedents of right.\r\n\r\nWe therefore do enact, and be it enacted by the General Assembly of\r\nVirginia, that all citizens of this commonwealth, and persons and\r\nauthorities within the same, shall pay full obedience at all times to\r\nthe acts which may be passed by the Congress of the United States, the\r\nobject of which shall be the construction of post roads, making canals of\r\nnavigation, and maintaining the same in any part of the United States,\r\nin like manner as if said acts were, _totidem verbis_, passed by the\r\nLegislature of this Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII.\r\n\r\n_Thoughts on Lotteries. February, 1826._\r\n\r\nIt is a common idea that games of chance are immoral. But what is\r\nchance? Nothing happens in this world without a cause. If we know the\r\ncause, we do not call it chance; but if we do not know it, we say it was\r\nproduced by chance. If we see a loaded die turn its lightest side up,\r\nwe know the cause, and that it is not an effect of chance; but whatever\r\nside an unloaded die turns up, not knowing the cause, we say it is\r\nthe effect of chance. Yet the morality of a thing cannot depend on our\r\nknowledge or ignorance of its cause. Not knowing why a particular side\r\nof an unloaded die turns up, cannot make the act of throwing it, or of\r\nbetting on it, immoral. If we consider games of chance immoral, then\r\nevery pursuit of human industry is immoral; for there is not a single\r\none that is not subject to chance, not one wherein you do not risk a\r\nloss for the chance of some gain. The navigator, for example, risks\r\nhis ship in the hope (if she is not lost in the voyage) of gaining an\r\nadvantageous freight. The merchant risks his cargo to gain a better\r\nprice for it. A landholder builds a house on the risk of indemnifying\r\nhimself by a rent. The hunter hazards his time and trouble in the hope\r\nof killing game. In all these pursuits, you stake some one thing against\r\nanother which you hope to win. But the greatest of all gamblers is the\r\nfarmer. He risks the seed he puts into the ground, the rent he pays for\r\nthe ground itself, the year's labor on it, and the wear and tear of his\r\ncattle and gear, to win a crop, which the chances of too much or too\r\nlittle rain, and general uncertainties of weather, insects, waste, &c.,\r\noften make a total or partial loss. These, then, are games of chance.\r\nYet so far from being immoral, they are indispensable to the existence\r\nof man, and every one has a natural right to choose for his pursuit such\r\none of them as he thinks most likely to furnish him subsistence. Almost\r\nall these pursuits of chance produce something useful to society. But\r\nthere are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the\r\nindividuals engaged in them, or of others depending on them. Such are\r\ngames with cards, dice, billiards, &c. And although the pursuit of them\r\nis a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible\r\nbent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by\r\nthem to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a\r\ncase of insanity, _quoad hoc_, step in to protect the family and the\r\nparty himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, &c.,\r\nand suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following\r\nit. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions,\r\nand injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are\r\ninsurances, lotteries, raffles, &c. These they do not suppress, but\r\ntake their regulation under their own discretion. The insurance of\r\nships on voyages is a vocation of chance, yet useful, and the right to\r\nexercise it therefore is left free. So of houses against fire, doubtful\r\ndebts, the continuance of a particular life, and similar cases. Money is\r\nwanting for a useful undertaking, as a school, &c., for which a direct\r\ntax would be disapproved. It is raised therefore by a lottery, wherein\r\nthe tax is laid on the willing only, that is to say, on those who can\r\nrisk the price of a ticket without sensible injury for the possibility\r\nof a higher prize. An article of property, insusceptible of division\r\nat all, or not without great diminution of its worth, is sometimes of\r\nso large value as that no purchaser can be found while the owner owes\r\ndebts, has no other means of payment, and his creditors no other chance\r\nof obtaining it but by its sale at a full and fair price. The lottery\r\nis here a salutary instrument for disposing of it, where many run small\r\nrisks for the chance of obtaining a high prize. In this way the great\r\nestate of the late Colonel Byrd (in 1756) was made competent to pay his\r\ndebts, which, had the whole been brought into the market at once, would\r\nhave overdone the demand, would have sold at half or quarter the value,\r\nand sacrificed the creditors, half or three-fourths of whom would have\r\nlost their debts. This method of selling was formerly very much resorted\r\nto, until it was thought to nourish too much a spirit of hazard. The\r\nlegislature were therefore induced not to suppress it altogether, but\r\nto take it under their own special regulation. This they did for the\r\nfirst time by their act of 1769, c. 17, before which time every person\r\nexercised the right freely; and since which time, it is made unlawful\r\nbut when approved and authorized by a special act of the legislature.\r\n\r\nSince then this right of sale, by way of lottery, has been exercised only\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the legislature. Let us examine the purposes\r\nfor which they have allowed it in practice, not looking beyond the date\r\nof our independence.\r\n\r\n1. It was for a long time an item of the standing revenue of the State.\r\n\r\n     1813. c. 1, § 3. An act imposing taxes for the support of government,\r\n                        and c. 2, § 10.\r\n     1814. Dec. c. 1, § 3.\r\n     1814. Feb. c. 1, § 3.\r\n     1818. c. 1, § 1.\r\n     1819. c. 1.\r\n     1820. c. 1.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a declaration by the nation, that an act was not immoral,\r\nof which they were in the habitual use themselves as a part of the regular\r\nmeans of supporting the government; the tax on the vender of tickets was\r\ntheir share of the profits, and if their share was innocent, his could\r\nnot be criminal.\r\n\r\n2. It has been abundantly permitted to raise money by lottery for the\r\npurposes of schools; and in this, as in many other cases, the lottery\r\nhas been permitted to retain a part of the money (generally from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent.) for the use to which the lottery has been applied.\r\nSo that while the adventurers paid one hundred dollars for tickets, they\r\nreceived back eighty-five or ninety dollars only in the form of prizes,\r\nthe remaining ten or fifteen being the tax levied on them, with their\r\nown consent. Examples are,\r\n\r\n     1784. c.  34. Authorizing the city of Williamsburg to raise £2,000\r\n                     for a grammar school.\r\n\r\n     1789. c.  68.

For the Bannister Academy.             }\r\n           c.  79. For the Belfield Academy.              }\r\n           c.  82. For the Petersburg Academy.            }\r\n     1804. c.  40. For the Hotsprings Seminary.           }\r\n           c.  76. For the Stevensburg Academy.           }\r\n           c. 100. For William and Mary College.          }\r\n     1805. c.  24. For the Rumford Academy.               }\r\n     1812. c.  10. For the Literary Fund. To sell the privilege for\r\n                     $30,000 annually, for seven years.\r\n     1816. c.  80. For Norfolk Academy, $12,000.\r\n                       Norfolk Female Society, $2,000.\r\n                       Lancastrian School, $6,000.\r\n\r\n3. The next object of lotteries has been rivers.\r\n\r\n     1790. c. 46. For a bridge between Gosport and Portsmouth,\r\n                    £400.\r\n     1796. c. 83. For clearing Roanoke River.\r\n     1804. c. 62. For clearing Quantico Creek.\r\n     1805. c. 42. For a toll bridge over Cheat River.\r\n     1816. c. 49. For the Dismal Swamp, $50,000.\r\n\r\n4. For roads.\r\n\r\n     1790. c. 46. For a road to Warminster, £200.\r\n                  For cutting a road from Rockfish gap to Scott's\r\n                    and Nicholas's landing, £400.\r\n     1796. c. 85. To repair certain roads.\r\n\r\n     1803. c. 60. For improving roads to Snigger's and Ashby's\r\n                    gaps.\r\n           c. 61.

To raise £4,000 for William Tatham, to enable\r\n                    him to complete his geographical work.\r\n                  To enable ---- to complete a literary work.[28]\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that every vocation in life is subject to the\r\ninfluence of chance; that so far from being rendered immoral by the\r\nadmixture of that ingredient, were they abandoned on that account,\r\nman could no longer subsist; that, among them, every one has a natural\r\nright to choose that which he thinks most likely to give him comfortable\r\nsubsistence; but that while the greater number of these pursuits are\r\nproductive of something which adds to the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife, others again, such as cards, dice, &c., are entirely unproductive,\r\ndoing good to none, injury to many, yet so easy, and so seducing in\r\npractice to men of a certain constitution of mind, that they cannot\r\nresist the temptation, be the consequences what they may; that in this\r\ncase, as in those of insanity, idiocy, infancy, &c., it is the duty of\r\nsociety to take them under its protection, even against their own acts,\r\nand to restrain their right of choice of these pursuits, by suppressing\r\nthem entirely; that there are others, as lotteries particularly, which,\r\nalthough liable to chance also, are useful for many purposes, and are\r\ntherefore retained and placed under the discretion of the Legislature, to\r\nbe permitted or refused according to the circumstances of every special\r\ncase, of which they are to judge; that between the years 1782 and 1820,\r\na space of thirty-eight years only, we have observed seventy cases, where\r\nthe permission of them has been found useful by the Legislature, some of\r\nwhich are in progress at this time. These cases relate to the emolument\r\nof the whole State, to local benefits of education, of navigation, of\r\nroads, of counties, towns, religious assemblies, private societies, and\r\nof individuals under particular circumstances which may claim indulgence\r\nor favor. The latter is the case now submitted to the Legislature, and\r\nthe question is, whether the individual soliciting their attention, or\r\nhis situation, may merit that degree of consideration which will justify\r\nthe Legislature in permitting him to avail himself of the mode of selling\r\nby lottery, for the purpose of paying his debts.\r\n\r\nThat a fair price cannot be obtained by sale in the ordinary way, and\r\nin the present depressed state of agricultural industry, is well known.\r\nLands in this State will now sell for more than a third or fourth of what\r\nthey would have brought a few years ago, perhaps at the very time of the\r\ncontraction of the debts for which they are now to be sold. The low price\r\nin foreign markets, for a series of years past, of agricultural produce,\r\nof wheat generally, of tobacco most commonly, and the accumulation of\r\nduties on the articles of consumption not produced within our State, not\r\nonly disable the farmer or planter from adding to his farm by purchase,\r\nbut reduces him to sell his own, and remove to the western country,\r\nglutting the market he leaves, while he lessens the number of bidders.\r\nTo be protected against this sacrifice is the object of the present\r\napplication, and whether the applicant has any particular claim to this\r\nprotection, is the present question.\r\n\r\nHere the answer must be left to others. It is not for me to give it. I\r\nmay, however, more readily than others, suggest the offices in which I\r\nhave served. I came of age in 1764, and was soon put into the nomination\r\nof justice of the county in which I live, and at the first election\r\nfollowing I became one of its representatives in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nI was thence sent to the old Congress.\r\n\r\nThen employed two years with Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Wythe, on the revisal\r\nand reduction to a single code of the whole body of the British statutes,\r\nthe acts of our Assembly, and certain parts of the common law.\r\n\r\nThen elected Governor.\r\n\r\nNext to the Legislature, and to Congress again.\r\n\r\nSent to Europe as Minister Plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\nAppointed Secretary of State to the new government.\r\n\r\nElected Vice-President, and\r\n\r\nPresident. And lastly, a Visitor and Rector of the University. In these\r\ndifferent offices, with scarcely any interval between them, I have been\r\nin the public service now sixty-one years; and during the far greater\r\npart of the time, in foreign countries or in other States. Every one\r\nknows how inevitably a Virginia estate goes to ruin, when the owner is\r\nso far distant as to be unable to pay attention to it himself; and the\r\nmore especially, when the line of his employment is of a character to\r\nabstract and alienate his mind entirely from the knowledge necessary to\r\ngood, and even to saving management.\r\n\r\nIf it were thought worth while to specify any particular services\r\nrendered, I would refer to the specification of them made by the\r\nLegislature itself in their Farewell Address, on my retiring from\r\nthe Presidency, February, 1809. [This will be found in 2 Pleasant's\r\nCollection, page 144.] There is one, however, not therein specified, the\r\nmost important in its consequences, of any transaction in any portion of\r\nmy life; to wit, the head I personally made against the federal principles\r\nand proceedings, during the administration of Mr. Adams. Their usurpations\r\nand violations of the constitution at that period, and their majority in\r\nboth Houses of Congress, were so great, so decided, and so daring, that\r\nafter combating their aggressions, inch by inch, without being able in\r\nthe least to check their career, the republican leaders thought it would\r\nbe best for them to give up their useless efforts there, go home, get\r\ninto their respective Legislatures, embody whatever of resistance they\r\ncould be formed into, and if ineffectual, to perish there as in the last\r\nditch. All, therefore, retired, leaving Mr. Gallatin alone in the House\r\nof Representatives, and myself in the Senate, where I then presided as\r\nVice-President. Remaining at our posts, and bidding defiance to the brow\r\nbeatings and insults by which they endeavored to drive us off also, we\r\nkept the mass of republicans in phalanx together, until the Legislature\r\ncould be brought up to the charge; and nothing on earth is more certain,\r\nthan that if myself particularly, placed by my office of Vice-President\r\nat the head of the republicans, had given way and withdrawn from my post,\r\nthe republicans throughout the Union would have given up in despair,\r\nand the cause would have been lost forever. By holding on, we obtained\r\ntime for the Legislature to come up with their weight; and those of\r\nVirginia and Kentucky particularly, but more especially the former, by\r\ntheir celebrated resolutions, saved the constitution at its last gasp.\r\nNo person who was not a witness of the scenes of that gloomy period, can\r\nform any idea of the afflicting persecutions and personal indignities we\r\nhad to brook. They saved our country however. The spirits of the people\r\nwere so much subdued and reduced to despair by the X Y Z imposture, and\r\nother stratagems and machinations, that they would have sunk into apathy\r\nand monarchy, as the only form of government which could maintain itself.\r\n\r\nIf Legislative services are worth mentioning, and the stamp of liberality\r\nand equality, which was necessary to be imposed on our laws in the\r\nfirst crisis of our birth as a nation, was of any value, they will find\r\nthat the leading and most important laws of that day were prepared by\r\nmyself, and carried chiefly by my efforts; supported, indeed, by able\r\nand faithful coadjutors from the ranks of the House, very effective as\r\nseconds, but who would not have taken the field as leaders.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the further importation of slaves was the first of\r\nthese measures in time.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the abolition of entails, which broke up the\r\nhereditary and high-handed aristocracy, which, by accumulating immense\r\nmasses of property in single lines of families, had divided our country\r\ninto two distinct orders, of nobles and plebeians.\r\n\r\nBut further to complete the equality among our citizens so essential to\r\nthe maintenance of republican government, it was necessary to abolish\r\nthe principle of primogeniture. I drew the law of descents, giving equal\r\ninheritance to sons and daughters, which made a part of the revised code.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the establishment of a dominant religion, was first made\r\nby myself. It could be carried at first only by a suspension of salaries\r\nfor one year, by battling it again at the next session for another year,\r\nand so from year to year, until the public mind was ripened for the\r\nbill for establishing religious freedom, which I had prepared for the\r\nrevised code also. This was at length established permanently, and by\r\nthe efforts chiefly of Mr. Madison, being myself in Europe at the time\r\nthat work was brought forward.\r\n\r\nTo these particular services, I think I might add the establishment of\r\nour University, as principally my work, acknowledging at the same time,\r\nas I do, the great assistance received from my able colleagues of the\r\nVisitation. But my residence in the vicinity threw, of course, on me\r\nthe chief burthen of the enterprise, as well of the buildings as of the\r\ngeneral organization and care of the whole. The effect of this institution\r\non the future fame, fortune and prosperity of our country, can as yet\r\nbe seen but at a distance. But an hundred well-educated youths, which\r\nit will turn out annually, and ere long, will fill all its offices with\r\nmen of superior qualifications, and raise it from its humble state to\r\nan eminence among its associates which it has never yet known; no, not\r\nin its brightest days. That institution is now qualified to raise its\r\nyouth to an order of science unequalled in any other State; and this\r\nsuperiority will be the greater from the free range of mind encouraged\r\nthere, and the restraint imposed at other seminaries by the shackles\r\nof a domineering hierarchy, and a bigoted adhesion to ancient habits.\r\nThose now on the theatre of affairs will enjoy the ineffable happiness of\r\nseeing themselves succeeded by sons of a grade of science beyond their\r\nown ken. Our sister States will also be repairing to the same fountains\r\nof instruction, will bring hither their genius to be kindled at our fire,\r\nand will carry back the fraternal affections which, nourished by the same\r\n_alma mater_, will knit us to them by the indissoluble bonds of early\r\npersonal friendships. The good Old Dominion, the blessed mother of us\r\nall, will then raise her head with pride among the nations, will present\r\nto them that splendor of genius which she has ever possessed, but has\r\ntoo long suffered to rest uncultivated and unknown, and will become a\r\ncentre of ralliance to the States whose youth she has instructed, and,\r\nas it were, adopted.\r\n\r\nI claim some share in the merits of this great work of regeneration. My\r\nwhole labors, now for many years, have been devoted to it, and I stand\r\npledged to follow it up through the remnant of life remaining to me.\r\nAnd what remuneration do I ask? Money from the treasury? Not a cent. I\r\nask nothing from the earnings or labors of my fellow citizens. I wish\r\nno man's comforts to be abridged for the enlargement of mine. For the\r\nservices rendered on all occasions, I have been always paid to my full\r\nsatisfaction. I never wished a dollar more than what the law had fixed\r\non. My request is, only to be permitted to sell my own property freely\r\nto pay my own debts. To _sell_ it, I say, and not to _sacrifice_ it, not\r\nto have it gobbled up by speculators to make fortunes for themselves,\r\nleaving unpaid those who have trusted to my good faith, and myself without\r\nresource in the last and most helpless stage of life. If permitted to\r\nsell it in a way which will bring me a fair price, all will be honestly\r\nand honorably paid, and a competence left for myself, and for those who\r\nlook to me for subsistence. To sell it in a way which will offend no moral\r\nprinciple, and expose none to risk but the willing, and those wishing\r\nto be permitted to take the chance of gain. To give me, in short, that\r\npermission which you often allow to others for purposes not more moral.\r\n\r\nWill it be objected, that although not evil in itself, it may, as a\r\nprecedent, lead to evil? But let those who shall quote the precedent\r\nbring their case within the same measure. Have they, as in this case,\r\ndevoted three-score years and one of their lives, uninterruptedly, to\r\nthe service of their country? Have the times of those services been\r\nas trying as those which have embraced our Revolution, our transition\r\nfrom a colonial to a free structure of government? Have the stations of\r\ntheir trial been of equal importance? Has the share they have borne in\r\nholding their new government to its genuine principles, been equally\r\nmarked? And has the cause of the distress, against which they seek a\r\nremedy, proceeded, not merely from themselves, but from errors of the\r\npublic authorities, disordering the circulating medium, over which they\r\nhad no control, and which have, in fact, doubled and trebled debts, by\r\nreducing, in that proportion, the value of the property which was to pay\r\nthem? If all these circumstances, which characterize the present case,\r\nhave taken place in theirs also, then follow the precedent. Be assured,\r\nthe cases will be so rare as to produce no embarrassment, as never to\r\nsettle into an injurious habit. The single feature of a sixty years'\r\nservice, as no other instance of it has yet occurred in our country, so\r\nit probably never may again. And should it occur, even once and again,\r\nit will not impoverish your treasury, as it takes nothing from that, and\r\nasks but a simple permission, by an act of natural right, to do one of\r\nmoral justice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [27] The acts not being at hand, the sums allowed are not known.\r\n\r\n     [28] I found such an act, but not noting it at the time,\r\n     I have not been able to find it again. But there is such\r\n     an one.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Jefferson's Will._\r\n\r\nI, Thomas Jefferson, of Monticello, in Albemarle, being of sound mind\r\nand in my ordinary state of health, make my last will and testament in\r\nmanner and form as follows:\r\n\r\nI give to my grandson Francis Eppes, son of my dear deceased daughter\r\nMary Eppes, in fee simple, all that part of my lands at Poplar Forest\r\nlying west of the following lines, to wit: beginning at Radford's upper\r\ncorner, near the double branches of Bear Creek and the public road, and\r\nrunning thence in a straight line to the fork of my private road, near\r\nthe barn; thence along that private road, (as it was changed in 1817,)\r\nto its crossing of the main branch of North Tomahawk Creek; and from\r\nthat crossing, in a direct line over the main ridge which divides the\r\nNorth and South Tomahawk, to the South Tomahawk, at the confluence of\r\ntwo branches where the old road to the Waterlick crossed it, and from\r\nthat confluence up the northernmost branch, (which separate M'Daniels'\r\nand Perry's fields,) to its source; and thence by the shortest line\r\nto my western boundary. And having, in a former correspondence with\r\nmy deceased son-in-law John W. Eppes, contemplated laying off for him,\r\nwith remainder to my grandson Francis, a certain portion in the southern\r\npart of my lands in Bedford and Campbell, which I afterwards found to be\r\ngenerally more indifferent than I had supposed, and therefore determined\r\nto change its location for the better; now to remove all doubt, if\r\nany could arise on a purpose merely voluntary and unexecuted, I hereby\r\ndeclare that what I have herein given to my said grandson Francis, is\r\ninstead of, and not additional to, what I had formerly contemplated. I\r\nsubject all my other property to the payment of my debts in the first\r\nplace. Considering the insolvent state of the affairs of my friend and\r\nson-in-law Thomas Mann Randolph, and that what will remain of my property\r\nwill be the only resource against the want in which his family would\r\notherwise be left, it must be his wish, as it is my duty, to guard that\r\nresource against all liability for his debts, engagements or purposes\r\nwhatsoever, and to preclude the rights, powers, and authorities over\r\nit, which might result to him by operation of law, and which might,\r\nindependently of his will, bring it within the power of his creditors,\r\nI do hereby devise and bequeath all the residue of my property, real\r\nand personal, in possession or in action, whether held in my own right,\r\nor in that of my dear deceased wife, according to the powers vested\r\nin me by deed of settlement for that purpose, to my grandson Thomas J.\r\nRandolph, and my friends Nicholas P. Trist and Alexander Garrett, and\r\ntheir heirs, during the life of my said son-in-law Thomas M. Randolph,\r\nto be held and administered by them, in trust, for the sole and separate\r\nuse and behoof of my dear daughter Martha Randolph, and her heirs; and\r\naware of the nice and difficult distinction of the law in these cases,\r\nI will further explain by saying, that I understand and intend the\r\neffect of these limitations to be, that the legal estate and actual\r\noccupation shall be vested in my said trustees, and held by them in\r\nbase fee, determinable on the death of my said son-in-law, and the\r\nremainder during the same time be vested in my said daughter and her\r\nheirs, and of course disposable by her last will, and that at the death\r\nof my said son-in-law, the particular estate of the trustees shall be\r\ndetermined, and the remainder, in legal estate, possession, and use,\r\nbecome vested in my said daughter and her heirs, in absolute property\r\nforever. In consequence of the variety and indescribableness of the\r\narticles of property within the house at Monticello, and the difficulty\r\nof inventorying and appraising them separately and specifically, and\r\nits inutility, I dispense with having them inventoried and appraised;\r\nand it is my will that my executors be not held to give any security for\r\nthe administration of my estate. I appoint my grandson Thomas Jefferson\r\nRandolph, my sole executor during his life, and after his death, I\r\nconstitute executors my friends Nicholas P. Trist and Alexander Garrett,\r\njoining to them my daughter Martha Randolph, after the death of my said\r\nson-in-law Thomas M. Randolph. Lastly, I revoke all former wills by me\r\nheretofore made; and in witness that this is my will, I have written\r\nthe whole with my own hand on two pages, and have subscribed my name\r\nto each of them this sixteenth day of March, one thousand eight hundred\r\nand twenty-six.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI, Thomas Jefferson, of Monticello, in Albemarle, make and add the\r\nfollowing codicil to my will, controlling the same so far as its\r\nprovisions go:\r\n\r\nI recommend to my daughter Martha Randolph, the maintenance and care\r\nof my well beloved sister Anne Scott, and trust confidently that from\r\naffection to her, as well as for my sake, she will never let her want a\r\ncomfort. I have made no specific provision for the comfortable maintenance\r\nof my son-in-law Thomas M. Randolph, because of the difficulty and\r\nuncertainty of devising terms which shall vest any beneficial interest\r\nin him, which the law will not transfer to the benefit of his creditors,\r\nto the destitution of my daughter and her family, and disablement of\r\nher to supply him: whereas, property placed under the exclusive control\r\nof my daughter and her independent will, as if she were a femme sole,\r\nconsidering the relation in which she stands both to him and his children,\r\nwill be a certain resource against want for all.\r\n\r\nI give to my friend James Madison, of Montpelier, my gold-mounted\r\nwalking staff of animal horn, as a token of the cordial and affectionate\r\nfriendship which for nearly now an half century, has united us in the\r\nsame principles and pursuits of what we have deemed for the greatest\r\ngood of our country.\r\n\r\nI give to the University of Virginia my library, except such particular\r\nbooks only, and of the same edition, as it may already possess, when this\r\nlegacy shall take effect; the rest of my said library, remaining after\r\nthose given to the University shall have been taken out, I give to my two\r\ngrandsons-in-law Nicholas P. Trist and Joseph Coolidge. To my grandson\r\nThomas Jefferson Randolph, I give my silver watch in preference of the\r\ngolden one, because of its superior excellence. My papers of business\r\ngoing of course to him, as my executor, all others of a literary or\r\nother character I give to him as of his own property.\r\n\r\nI give a gold watch to each of my grandchildren, who shall not have\r\nalready received one from me, to be purchased and delivered by my executor\r\nto my grandsons, at the age of twenty-one, and granddaughters at that\r\nof sixteen.\r\n\r\nI give to my good, affectionate, and faithful servant Burwell, his\r\nfreedom, and the sum of three hundred dollars, to buy necessaries to\r\ncommence his trade of glazier, or to use otherwise, as he pleases.\r\n\r\nI give also to my good servants John Hemings and Joe Fossett, their\r\nfreedom at the end of one year after my death;
