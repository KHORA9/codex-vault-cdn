IV.--DECEMBER, 1863.--No. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are of the race of the Empire Builders. Some races have been sent\r\ninto the world to destroy. Ours has been sent to create. It was needed\r\nthat the blunders of ten centuries and more, across the water, should be\r\ngiven a chance for amendment. On virgin soil, the European races might\r\ncure themselves of the fever pains of ages. So they were called here to\r\ntry. There was no rubbish to sweep away. The mere destructive had no\r\noccupation. The builder and creator was the man wanted. In the full glow\r\nof civilization, with the accumulated experience of the toiling\r\ngenerations, with all the wealth of the fruitful past, we, 'the foremost\r\nin the files of time,' have been called to this business of _nation\r\nmaking_.\r\n\r\nThe men of our blood, they say, are given to boasting. America adds\r\nflashing nerve fire to the dull muscle of Europe. That is the fact. But\r\nthe tendency to boasting is an honest inheritance. We can hardly boast\r\nlouder than our fathers across the sea have taught us. The boasting of\r\nNew York can scarcely drown the boasting of London. Jonathan thinks\r\nhighly of himself, but, certainly, John Bull is not behind him in\r\nself-esteem.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, what wonder? Ten centuries of victory over nature and\r\nover men may give a race the right to boast--ten centuries of victory\r\nwith never a defeat! The English tongue is an arrogant tongue, we grant.\r\nCommand, mastery, lordliness, are bred into its tones. The old tongue of\r\nthe Romans was never deeper marked in those respects than our own. It is\r\na freeman's speech, this mother language. A slave can never speak it. He\r\ngarbles, clips, and mumbles it, makes 'quarter talk' of it. The hour he\r\nlearns to speak English he is spoiled for a slave. It is the tongue of\r\nconquerors, the language of imperial will, of self-asserting\r\nindividuality, of courage, masterhood, and freedom. There is no need of\r\nbeing thin-skinned under the charge of boasting. A man cannot very well\r\nlearn, in his cradle, 'the tongue that Shakspeare spake,' without\r\ntalking sometimes as if he and his owned creation.\r\n\r\nFor the tongue is the representative of the speaker. A people embodies\r\nits soul in its language. And the people who inherit English have done\r\nwork enough in this little world to give them a right to do some\r\ntalking. They, at least, can speak their boast, and hear it seconded, in\r\nthe bold accents their mothers taught them, on every shore and on every\r\nsea. They have been the world's day-laborers now for some centuries.\r\nThey have felled its forests, drained its marshes, dug in its mines,\r\nploughed its wastes, built its cities. They have done rough pioneer work\r\nover all its surface. They have done it, too, as it never was done\r\nbefore. They have made it _stay done_. They have never given up one inch\r\nof conquered ground. They have never yielded back one square foot to\r\nbarbarism. Won once to civilization, under their leadership, and your\r\nsquare mile of savage waste and jungle is won forever.\r\n\r\nWe are inclined to think the world might bear with us. We talk a great\r\ndeal about ourselves, perhaps; but, on the whole, are we not buying the\r\nprivilege? Did a race ever buckle to its business in this world in more\r\nsplendid style than our own? With both hands clenched, stripped to the\r\nwaist, blackened and begrimed and sweat bathed, this race takes its\r\nplace in the vanguard of the world and bends to its chosen toil. The\r\ngrand, patient, hopeful people, how they grasp blind brute nature, and\r\ntame her, and use her at their word! How they challenge and defeat in\r\nthe death grapple the grim giants of the waste and the storm--fever,\r\nfamine, and the frost!\r\n\r\nYou will find them down, to-day, among the firedamps in the mines,\r\nto-morrow among the splendid pinnacles of the mountains, to settle a\r\nfact of science, or add a mite to human knowledge. Here is one,\r\npainfully toiling through the tangled depths of a desert continent, to\r\nfind a highway for commerce or Christianity. Here is another, in the\r\nlonely seas around the pole, where the ghostly ice-mountains go drifting\r\nthrough the gray mists, patiently wrestling with the awful powers of\r\nnature, to snatch its secret from the hoary deep, and bring it home in\r\ntriumph. Hard fisted, big boned, tough brained, and stout hearted,\r\nscared at nothing, beaten back by no resistance, baffled, for long, by\r\nno obstacle, this race works as though the world were only one vast\r\nworkshop, and they wanted all the tools and all the materials, and were\r\nanxious to monopolize the work of the world.\r\n\r\nThey are workers primarily, makers, producers, builders. Labor is their\r\nappointed business as a people. Sometimes they have to fight, when fools\r\nstand in their way, or traitors oppose their endeavors. They have had to\r\ndo, indeed, their fair share of fighting. Things go so awry in this\r\nworld that a patient worker is often called to drop his tools, square\r\nhimself, and knock down some idiot who insists on bothering him. And\r\nthis race of ours has therefore often, patient as it is, flamed out into\r\noccasional leonine wrath. It really does not like fighting. That\r\nperformance interferes with its proper business. It takes to the\r\nploughshare more kindly than to the sabre, and likes to manage a steam\r\nengine better than a six-gun battery. But if imbeciles and scoundrels\r\nwill get in its way, and will mar its pet labors, then, heaven help\r\nthem! The patient blood blazes into lava, fire, the big muscles strain\r\nover the black cannon, the brawny arm guides the fire-belching tower of\r\niron on the sea, and, when these people do fight, they fight, like the\r\nTitans when they warred with Jove, with a roar that shakes the spheres.\r\nThey go at that as they do at everything. They fight to clear this\r\nconfusion up, to settle it once for all, so it will _stay_ settled, that\r\nthey may go to their work again in peace. Fond of a clean job, they\r\ninsist on making a clean job of their fighting, if they have to fight at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n'But, after all, this race of ours is selfish,' you say. 'It works only\r\nfor itself, and you are making something grand and heroic out of that.\r\nIf it civilizes, it civilizes for itself. If it builds cities, drains\r\nmarshes, redeems jungles, explores rivers, builds railroads, and prints\r\nnewspapers, it is doing all for its own pocket.' Well, we say, why not?\r\nIs the laborer not worthy of his hire? Do you expect a patient, toiling\r\npeople to conquer a waste continent here, for God and man, and get\r\nnothing for it from either? A people never yet did a good stroke of work\r\nin this world without getting a fair day's wages for the job. The old\r\ntwo-fisted Romans, in their day, did a good deal of hard work in the way\r\nof road and bridge building, and the like of that, across the sea, and\r\ndid it well, and they got paid for it by several centuries of mastery\r\nover Europe. We rather think, high as the pay was, and little as the\r\nlate Romans seem to have deserved it, it was, on the whole, a profitable\r\nbargain for Europe. The truth is, our race has, like all other great\r\ncreating races, been building wiser than it knew. It is not necessary\r\nthat such a race should be conscious of its mission. In its own\r\nintention it may work for itself. By the guiding of the Great Master, it\r\ndoes work for all humanity and all time. If a race comes on the earth\r\nmere fighters, brigands, and thieves, living by force, fraud, and\r\noppression, even then it serves a purpose. It destroys something that\r\nneeds destroying. In its own turn, however, it must perish. But an\r\nhonest race, that undertakes to earn its honest living on the earth, and\r\nin the main does earn it, honestly and industriously, by planting and\r\nbuilding, like our own, never works merely for itself. It plants and\r\nbuilds to stand forever. The results of patient toil never perish. They\r\nare so much clear gain to humanity.\r\n\r\nTo many, the _conscious_ end of the existence of the Yankee nation may\r\nhave been a small affair indeed. That end is only what they make it. Its\r\n_unconscious_ end is, however, another matter. That end God has made. To\r\none man, the nation exists that he may make wooden clocks and sell them.\r\nTo another, the chief end of the nation's existence is that he may get a\r\ngood crop of wheat to market during rising quotations. To another, that\r\nhe may do a good stroke of business in the boot and shoe line. To\r\nanother, that he may make a good thing in stocks. To some in the past,\r\nthis nation existed solely that men might breed negroes in Virginia, and\r\nwork them in Alabama! This great nation was worth the blacks it owned,\r\nand the cotton it raised! Actually that was all. The _conscious_ end to\r\nthousands amounted to about this. Men looked at the nation from their\r\nown small place. They dwarfed its purposes. They made them small and\r\nmean and low. They did this three years ago more commonly, we think,\r\nthan they do now. The war has taught us many things. It has certainly\r\ntaught us higher ideas of the value of the Nation, and a loftier idea of\r\nthe meaning of its life. We have awaked to the fact that we are trustees\r\nof this continent for the world. We have been fighting for two years and\r\nmore, not to save this nation for the value of its wheat, or cotton, or\r\nmanufactures, or exports, but for the value of the ideas, the hopes, the\r\naspirations, the tendencies this nation embodies. We have risen to see\r\nthat it were a good bargain to barter all the material wealth it holds\r\nfor the priceless spiritual ideas it represents. France babbles about\r\n'going to war for an idea.' We don't babble. We buckle on our armor and\r\nfight, we practical, money-making Yankees, who are said to value\r\neverything by dollars, and, after two years of tremendous fighting, are\r\nhalf amazed ourselves to find we have been fighting solely for a\r\nhalf-dozen ideas the world can lose only at the cost of despair. Since\r\nthe days when men left house and home and friends, with red crosses on\r\ntheir hearts, to redeem from the hands of the infidel the sepulchre\r\nwhich the dead Christ once made holy, the world has never seen a war\r\ncarried on for a more purely ideal end than our own. We fight for the\r\nintegrity of _the Nation_. We fight for what that word means of hope\r\nand confidence and freedom and advancement to the groaning and\r\nbewildered world. We say, let all else perish,--wealth, commerce,\r\nagriculture, cunning manufacture, humanizing art. We expend all to save\r\n_the Nation_. That priceless possession we shall hold intact to the end,\r\nfor ourselves, our children, and the coming years!\r\n\r\nLet us see what this thing is that we prize so highly. Let us see if we\r\nare paying any too high a price for our object--if it is worth a million\r\nlives and a countless treasure. What is _the Nation_?\r\n\r\nThere used to be a theory of 'the Social Compact.' It was a prominent\r\ntheory in the French Revolution, It was vastly older, however, than that\r\nevent. It was originally a theory of the Epicureans. Ovid has something\r\nto say about it. Horace advocates it. It has not perished. It exists in\r\na fragmentary way in some books taught in colleges. It has more or less\r\nof a hold still on many minds. This theory teaches that the natural\r\nstate of man is a state of warfare, an isolated savagery, where each\r\nman's hand is against his neighbor, each lord and master for himself,\r\nwith no rights except what force gives him, and no possessions except\r\nwhat he can hold by force. This natural state, however, was found to be\r\na very uncomfortable state, and so men contrive to get out of it as soon\r\nas possible. For this purpose they form a 'social compact.' They come\r\ntogether, and agree to give up some of their natural rights to a settled\r\ngovernment, on condition that government protect them in the others.\r\nThat is to say, naturally they have the right to steal all they can lay\r\ntheir hands on, to rob, plunder, murder, and commit adultery, if they\r\nhave the power, and, generally, to live like a pack of amiable tiger\r\ncats; but that these pleasant and amusing natural rights they consent to\r\ngive up, on condition they are relieved from the trouble of guarding\r\nothers. Just such babblement as that you can read in very learned books,\r\nand stuff like that has actually been taught in colleges, and nobody was\r\nsent to the lunatic asylum! That is the theory of the 'Social Compact.'\r\nThat is the way, according to that theory, that nations are made.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to say of this old heathen dream, that there never was such\r\na state of savage brutalism known since man was man. All men are born\r\nunder some law, some government, some controlling authority. As long as\r\nfathers and mothers are necessary, in the economy of nature, to a man's\r\ngetting into the world at all, it is very hard for him to escape law and\r\ncontrol when he comes. I was never asked whether I would be a citizen of\r\nthe United States, whether it was my high will to come into 'the Social\r\nCompact' existing here. Neither were you. No man ever was. Just fancy\r\nthe United States solemnly asking all the infants born this year, 'if\r\nthey are willing to join the social compact and behave themselves in the\r\ncountry as respectable babies should!\r\n\r\nIt is vastly better to take facts and try to comprehend and use them.\r\nAnd, as a fact, man is not naturally a brute beast. He never had to make\r\na Social Compact. He has always found one made ready to his hand. Some\r\nestablished order, some national life has always stood ready to receive\r\nthe new recruit to the ranks of humanity, put him in his place, and ask\r\nhim no questions. He is made for society. Society is made for him. He is\r\nnot isolated, but joined to his fellows by links stronger than iron, by\r\nbands no steel can sever. The nation stands waiting for him. In some\r\nshape, with some development of national life, but always essentially\r\nthe same, the nation takes him, plastic at his birth, into its great\r\nhands, and moulds and fashions him, by felt and unfelt influences,\r\nwhether he will or no, into the national shape and figure.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what nations are made for. They do not exist to produce\r\nwheat, corn, cattle, cotton, or cutlery, but to produce _men_. The\r\nwheat, corn, and the rest exist for the sake of the men. The real value\r\nof the nation, to itself and to the world, is not the things it\r\nproduces, but the style of man it produces. That is the broad difference\r\nbetween China and Massachusetts, between Japan and New York. Nations\r\nexist to be training schools for men. That is their real business.\r\nAccordingly as they do it better or worse they are prospering or the\r\nreverse. What is France about? The newspaper people tell me she is\r\nbuilding ships, drilling zouaves, diplomatizing at Rome, brigandizing in\r\nMexico, huzzaing for glory and Napoleon the Third. That is about the\r\nwisdom of the newspapers. She is moulding a million unsuspecting little\r\ninnocents into Frenchmen! That is what she is at, and nobody seems to\r\nnotice. What is England doing? Weaving cotton, when she can get it, I am\r\ntold, drilling rifle brigades, blustering in the _Times_, starving her\r\nworkmen in Lancashire, and feasting her Prince in London, talking\r\n'strict neutrality' in Parliament, and building pirates on the Clyde.\r\nShe's doing worse than that. That is not half her wrong-doing. She is\r\ntaking thousands of plastic, impressible, innocent babes, into her big\r\nhands, monthly, and kneading them and hardening them into regular John\r\nBulls! That's a pretty job to think of!\r\n\r\nSo the nations are at work all over the world. And the nation that, as a\r\nrule, takes 'mamma's darling' into its arms, and in twenty or thirty\r\nyears makes him the best specimen of a man, is the most perfect nation\r\nand best fulfils a nation's purpose.\r\n\r\nFor the business of Education, which so many consider the schoolmaster's\r\nspeciality, is a larger business than they think. The Family exists to\r\ndo it, the Church exists to do it. It is the real business of the State.\r\nThe great Universe itself, with all its vastness, its powers and its\r\nmysteries, was created for this. It is simply God's great schoolroom. He\r\nhas floored it with the emerald queen of the earth and of the gleaming\r\nseas. He has roofed it with a sapphire dome, lit with flaming starfire\r\nand sun blaze. He has set the great organ music of the spheres\r\nreverberating forevermore through its high arches. He has put his\r\nchildren here, to train them for their grand inheritance. He has ordered\r\nnature and life and circumstance for this one great end.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Nation is not a joint-stock company. It is not a\r\npaper association. It is not a mutual assurance society for life\r\nand property. That is the shallow, surface notion that makes\r\nsuch miserable babble in political speeches. The Nation is Divine and\r\nnot Human. It is of GOD's making and not of man's. It is a moral\r\nschool, a spiritual training institute for educating and graduating men.\r\nFor that purpose it is _alive_. Men can make associations, companies,\r\ncompacts. God only makes _living bodies_, divine, perpetual\r\ninstitutions, with life in themselves, which exist because man exists,\r\nwhich can never end till man ends. The Family is one of these. The Church\r\nis another, in any shape it comes. The Nation is another, holding Family\r\nand Church both in its arms.\r\n\r\nTrue, from the fact that the power, the administration and the\r\narrangements of details are in men's hands in the nation mistake is\r\ncommon, and people are tempted to think the Nation purely human. All\r\nthought below the surface will show the fallacy and stamp the Nation as\r\nthe handiwork of God.\r\n\r\nWe believe true thought on this matter is, at this day and in this land,\r\nof first importance. The Lord of Hosts rules, and not the master of a\r\nthousand regiments with smoking cannon. God builds the Nation for a\r\npurpose. While it fulfils that purpose it shall stand. The banded folly\r\nand scoundrelhood within and the gathered force of all enemies without\r\nshall never overthrow one pillar in its strong foundations or topple\r\ndown one stone from its battlements while it works honestly toward its\r\ntrue end. Not till it turn traitor to its place and purposes, not till\r\nit madly plant itself in the way of the great wheels that roll the world\r\nback to light and justice, will He who built it hurl it to the earth\r\nagain in crashing ruin, to build another order in its place. The man who\r\nhas let that great truth, written out in flame across the dusky forehead\r\nof the Past, slip from his foolish atheist's heart and his shallow\r\natheist's brain, is blind, not only to our own land's short history, but\r\nto the lessons of the long ages and the broad world.\r\n\r\nWe have been driven back to the loftiest ground on this question. We\r\nhave found that only on that could we stand. When the very foundations\r\nof what we held most awful and reverential have been assailed by mad\r\ntraitorous hands, as though they were vulgar things, when frenzied\r\nself-will has laid its profane grasp upon the Ark of the Covenant, we\r\nhave been forced back to those strong foundations on which nations\r\nstand, for hope and confidence, to those tremendous sanctions that\r\ngirdle in, as with the fires of God, the sanctity of Law, the majesty of\r\nOrder, and established Right. We have declared these things Divine. We\r\nhave said men administer truly, but men did not create, and men have no\r\nright to destroy. We arise in the defence of institutions of which\r\nJehovah has made us the guardians for men!\r\n\r\nWe have said the Nation exists to train men, that the best nation is the\r\none that trains the best men. Let us see how it does this.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it educates by Written Law. To be sure, laws are\r\npassed to define and protect human rights, in person, purse, family, or\r\ngood name. People sometimes think that is all they do. But consider.\r\nThese laws on the Statute Book are the Nation's deliberate convictions,\r\nso far, on right and wrong, a real code of morals, the decisions of the\r\nnational conscience on moral subjects. An act is passed punishing theft.\r\nIt is intended to protect property indeed, but it does more. It stands\r\nthere, the Nation's conviction on a point of ethics. Theft is absolutely\r\nwrong. It passes another act punishing perjury. The mere lawyer looks at\r\nthis solely as a facility for getting at the truth before a jury. It is\r\nvastly more. It is a moral decision. The Nation binds the Ten\r\nCommandments on the popular conscience, and declares, 'Thou shalt not\r\nbear false witness.' It declares, 'There are everlasting distinctions,\r\nthings absolutely right, and things absolutely wrong. So far has the\r\nconscience of the Nation made things clear. The good citizen knows all\r\nthis without the Statute Book, and much more. But there must be a limit\r\nsomewhere. Here it is. Up to this point you may come, but no farther.\r\nEverlasting distinctions must be taught by bolts, chains, and scaffolds,\r\nif there are those in the Nation who will learn them from no other\r\nteachers.'\r\n\r\nIt has been very easy to tamper with Law among ourselves, very easy to\r\ntry experiments. And people get the notion that Law is a mere human\r\naffair, the act of a legislature, the will of a majority. It is all a\r\nmistake. A Nation's living laws are the slow growth of ages. They are\r\nits solemn convictions on wrongs and rights, written in its heart. The\r\nbusiness of a wise legislator is to help all those convictions to\r\nexpression in formal enactment. Meddling fools try to choke them, pass\r\nacts against them even, think they can annihilate such convictions. One\r\nday the convictions insist on being heard, if not by formal law, then by\r\nterrible informal protest against some legalized wrong. Think how\r\nlaboriously lawmakers have toiled to prevent the expression of the\r\nNation's determined convictions on the subject of Slavery! Think of the\r\nend! Nay, all enactments which accord with these deep decisions of the\r\nNational Conscience, which help them to better expression and clearer\r\nacknowledgment, are the real Laws of the Land. All that oppose these\r\ndecisions, though passed by triumphant majorities, with loud jubilation,\r\nand fastened on the Nation as its sense of right, are mere rubbish, sure\r\nto be swept away as the waves of the National life roll on.\r\n\r\nWe, by no means, hold that even the best nation, in its most living\r\nlaws, always declares perfect truth and perfect right. Human errors and\r\nweaknesses enter into all things with which men deal. And the Nation is\r\nordered and guided by men. Nevertheless the Nation is an authorized\r\nteacher of morals, and these errors are the accidents of the\r\ninstitution. They are not of its essence. So far as they exist, they\r\nblock its working, they stand in its way. Pure, clear Justice is the\r\nperfect ideal toward which a living, advancing Nation aims. That it\r\ndaily come nearer this ideal is the basis of its permanence. And,\r\nmeanwhile, though the result be far from attained, we none the less hold\r\nthat the Law of the Nation is, to every man within it, the Law of God.\r\nHis business, as a wise man, is to accept it, obey it, help it to\r\namendment where he believes there is error, with all patience and\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nFor the first disorder in the makeup of man is wilfulness. The child\r\nkicks and scratches in his cradle. It wants to have its own small will.\r\nThe first lesson it has to learn is the lesson of submission, that the\r\nuntried world, into which it is thrust, is not a place of self-pleasing\r\nbut of law. It takes parents and teachers years to get that fact through\r\nthe stubborn youngster's head. It will burn its fingers, it will tumble\r\ndown stairs, it will pitch head first over fences, because it will not\r\nlearn to forego its own small, ignorant will, and submit to wiser and\r\nlarger wills. In the good old days they used to think that matter ought\r\nto be learned in childhood once for all, and they labored faithfully to\r\nconvince us urchins, by the unsparing logic of the rod, that the law of\r\nlife is not self-will. Some of us, possibly, remember those emphatic\r\nlessons yet.\r\n\r\nIt is hard, however, to learn this thing perfectly. And so after the\r\nMother, Father, and Teacher get through, the Nation takes up the lesson.\r\nA wise, wide, unselfish will takes command, and puts down the narrow,\r\nconceited, selfish will of the individual. The individual will may think\r\nitself very wise and very right. But the large will, the broad, strong,\r\nwise will of the Nation, comes and says: 'Here is the _Law_, the\r\nembodiment of the great, wide, wise will, to which the wisest and the\r\nstrongest must submit and bow.'\r\n\r\nThat is the law of human position. Not self-will but obedience, not\r\nanarchy but order, not mad uncontrolledness, but calm submission, even\r\nto temporary error and wrong, is the road to ultimate perfection.\r\nTherefore, we can say nothing too reverential of Law. We cannot guard\r\ntoo jealously the clear trumpet-tongued preacher of everlasting right,\r\nsounding out a great Nation's convictions of obligation and duty. Hedge\r\nits sanctity with a ring wall of fire. Reverence the voice of the land\r\nfor right and order. We have exploded forever, let us trust, the notion\r\nof 'the right divine of kings to govern wrong.' We must cling,\r\ntherefore, with tenfold tenacity to the right divine of Law, the Sacred\r\nMajesty of the Nation's settled Order.\r\n\r\nBut the Written Law is only one way in which the Nation brings its\r\nteachings home to the individual. It is not the strongest way. The\r\nNation's most powerful formative influence lies in its _traditions_, its\r\nunwritten law, its sense and feeling about the questions of human life\r\nand conduct, handed down from father to son in the continuity of the\r\nnational life. And the power to hand these down depends on the fact that\r\nthe Nation is a living organism.\r\n\r\nFor examine, and you will find every nation has a power to mould men\r\nafter a certain model. We are Americans because we have been made so by\r\nthe national influence. Rome, in old time, moulded men after a certain\r\ntype, and, with infinite small diversities, made them all Romans. Greece\r\ntook them, and, on another model, made them Greeks. England has the\r\nartistic power, and kneads the clay of childhood into the grown up\r\ncreature the world knows as an Englishman. France has the same power,\r\nand manufactures the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nNow this moulding power, which every nation has, and the greatest\r\nnations the most markedly of all, comes mostly from what we call the\r\nNational Tradition. Some people call it Public Opinion. They think they\r\ncan even make it. They suppose it belongs to the present. In fact, they\r\ncannot make it to any extent at all. It belongs to the past. It is a\r\nthing inherited. It is best to call it National Tradition.\r\n\r\nFor the nation, being an organism, and living, its life does not end\r\nwith one generation. The river flows to-day, and is the same river it\r\nwas a thousand years ago, though every wave and every drop has changed a\r\nmillion times. So the generations heave on into the great sea and are\r\nforgotten, but the Nation abides the same. So all the thought, and\r\nfeeling, and conviction of the Nation to-day, on questions of human life\r\nand duty, it brings from the far-away past, from the gray mists of the\r\ndistant hills where it took its rise.\r\n\r\nJust think! The life of every great, strong man and woman, who has\r\nlived, thought, worked in the Nation, has it not entered into the\r\nNation's life? Is not here yet, a part of the Nation's influence? Every\r\ngreat, distinct type of human nature grown in the Nation becomes forever\r\na mould in which to cast men. Every great deed done, every strong\r\nthought uttered, every noble life lived, is committed to the stream of\r\nthis national tradition. Every great victory won, every terrible defeat\r\nsuffered, every grand word spoken, every noble song sung, is alive to\r\nthe last. The living Nation drops nothing, loses nothing out of its\r\nlife. The Saxon Alfred, the Norman William, Scandinavian viking, moss\r\ntrooper of the border, they have all gone into our circulation, they all\r\nhelp to shape Americans. And we have added Washington, the stainless\r\ngentleman, and Jefferson, the unselfish statesman, and Franklin, the\r\npatient conqueror of circumstance, and a thousand others, as types by\r\nwhich to form the children of this people for a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThink, too, how the national tradition rejects all bad models, all mean\r\ntypes, how it refuses to touch them at any price, how it will only carry\r\ndown the grand models, the noble types. Arnold never enters as an\r\ninfluence into national training. The Arnolds and their treason are\r\nwhelmed and sunk, as the Davises and their treason will be. The\r\nWashingtons do live as types. Their deeds sweep on, like stately barks,\r\nborne proudly on the rolling waves of the Nation's life, with triumphal\r\nmusic on their snowy decks, the land's glory for evermore! Only the\r\nnoble, only the good, the true in some shape, never the utterly false or\r\nvile, will this national tradition hold and keep, as an influence and a\r\npower for time.\r\n\r\nUnseen, unfelt, but strong like God's hand, this power surrounds the\r\ncradle of the child. He finds it waiting for him. He does not know about\r\nit or reason about it. It takes him, soft and plastic as it finds him,\r\nand calls out his powers, and fashions them after its own forms. Before\r\nhe is twenty-one he is made up for good and all, an American, an\r\nEnglishman, or a Frenchman, _for life_. The creating influence was like\r\nthe air. He breathed it into his circulation.\r\n\r\nThere are people who think it very wise to quarrel with this state of\r\nthings. They think it philosophic to sneer at national prejudices, as\r\nthey call them, to call national pride and national feeling narrow and\r\nbigoted. It is simply very silly to quarrel with any divine and\r\nunalterable order of life. Better work under it and with it. Does not\r\nlove of country exalt and ennoble, and all the more because of its\r\nprejudices? Does not the very meanest feel himself higher, more worthy,\r\nmore self-respecting, because he is one of a strong, great, free people,\r\nwith a grand inheritance of heroism from the past, and grand\r\npossibilities for the future? Who will quarrel with the Frenchman, the\r\nEnglishman, or the Japanese, for holding his land the fairest land, his\r\nnation the noblest nation the sun shines on? Is it not my fixed faith\r\nthat he is utterly deluded? Do I not _know_ that my own land is the\r\ngarden of the Lord? Do I not see that its valleys are the holiest, and\r\nits mountains the loftiest, its rivers the most majestic, and its seas\r\nthe broadest, its men the bravest, and its women the purest and fairest\r\non the broad earth's face? Even Fourth of July orations have their uses.\r\n\r\nNo! thank Heaven for this virtue of patriotism! It lifts a man out of\r\nhis lower nature, and makes his heart beat with the hearts of heroes.\r\nThere are two or three things in the world men will die for. The Nation\r\nis one. They will die for the land where their fathers sleep. They will\r\nfling fortune, hope, peace, family bliss, life itself, all into the\r\ngulf, to save its hearths from shame, its roof trees from dishonor. They\r\nwill follow the tattered rag they have made the symbol of its right,\r\nthrough bursting shells and hissing hail of rifle shot, and serried\r\nranks of gleaming bayonets, 'into the jaws of death, into the mouth of\r\nHell,' when they are called. They will do this in thousands, the poorest\r\nbetter than the richest often, the humblest just as heroically as the\r\nleaders of the people. And therefore, we say, thank God for the\r\nelevating power of Patriotism, for national Pride, for national\r\n_prejudice_, if you will, that can, by this great love of country, so\r\nconquer selfishness, meanness, cowardice, and all lower loves, and make\r\nthe very lowest by its power a hero, while the mortal man dies for the\r\nimmortal Nation! Let a man commit himself boldly to the tendencies and\r\ninfluences of his race then. Let him work with them, not against them.\r\nHe cannot be too much an American, too thoroughly penetrated with the\r\nconvictions and the spirit of his country. And he need fear no\r\ncontracting narrowness. The Nation's aims are wiser far and loftier far\r\nthan the wisest and the loftiest of any one man, or any one generation.\r\n\r\nWe have faintly shadowed out here something of the meaning of THE\r\nNATION. If we are right, we can pay no price that shall come near\r\nits value. For ourselves, for our children, for the ages coming, it is\r\nverily the Ark of the Covenant. We have seen that we are here to build\r\nit. Because GOD needed these United States, He kept a continent\r\ntill the time was ripe, and then sent His workmen to the work. We are\r\nall, in our degree, builders on those walls. We are building fast, these\r\ndays. Some rotten stones have entered into the structure, and it is hard\r\nwork to get them out, but we shall succeed. We shall see that no more of\r\nthat kind get in. Let us build on the broad foundation of the fathers a\r\nstately palace, of marble, pure and white, whose towers shall flash back\r\nin glory the sunlight of centuries, towers of refuge against falsehood\r\nand wrong and cruelty forevermore.\r\n\r\nWe are all builders, we say. The humblest does his share. There's fear\r\nin that thought, but more of hope. Nothing perishes. The private, who\r\nfalls, bravely fighting, does his part like the general. The ploughman's\r\nhonest life gives its contribution to the Nation's greatness as the\r\nlife of Webster does. All is telling in 'the long results of time,'\r\nhelping to decide what style of manhood shall be fashioned in America\r\nfor generations.\r\n\r\nFor the great Nation grows slowly upward to its perfect proportions, as\r\nthe parent and teacher of men. And all things and all men in it help to\r\ndecide and develop that capacity. Not dazzling battle-bursts alone, not\r\nalone victorious charges on the trampled plain, not splendid triumphs,\r\nwhen laurelled legions march home from conquered provinces and humbled\r\nlands, not the mighty deeds of mighty men in camps, nor the mighty words\r\nof mighty men in senates, though all these do their part, and a grand\r\npart too--not these alone give the great land its character and might.\r\nThese come from a thousand little things, we seldom think of. By the\r\nworkman's axe that fells the forest as by the soldier's bayonet, by the\r\ngleaming ploughshare in the furrow as by the black Columbiad couchant on\r\nthe rampart, by the schoolhouse in the valley as by the grim battery on\r\nthe bay, by the church spire rising from the grove, by the humble\r\ncottage in the glen, by the Bible on the stand at eve, by the prayer\r\nfrom the peaceful hearth, by the bell that calls to worship through the\r\nhallowed air; by the merchant at his desk, and by the farmer in the\r\nharvest field, by the judge upon the bench, and the workman in his shop,\r\nby the student in his silent room, and by the sailor on the voiceful\r\nsea, by the honest speaker's tongue, by the honest writer's pen, and by\r\nthe free press that gives the words of both a thousand pair of eagles'\r\nwings over land and sea, by every just and kindly word and work, by\r\nevery honest, humble industry, by every due reward to manliness and\r\nright and loyalty, and by every shackle forged and every gallows built\r\nfor villany and scoundrelhood; by a thousand things like these about us\r\ndaily, working unnoticed year by year, is the great river swelled, of\r\nthought and feeling and conviction, that floats a mighty nation's\r\ngrandeur on through the waiting centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKLE, DRAPER, AND A SCIENCE OF HISTORY.\r\n\r\n_SECOND PAPER._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word _Science_ has been so indiscriminately applied to very diverse\r\ndepartments of our intellectual domain, that it has ceased to have any\r\ndistinctive or well-defined signification. Meaning, appropriately, that\r\nwhich is certainly _known_, as distinguished from that which is matter\r\nof conjecture, opinion, thought, or plausible supposition merely, its\r\napplication to any special branch of human inquiry signifies, in that\r\nsense, that the facts and principles relating to the given branch, or\r\nconstituting it, are no longer subjects of uncertain investigation, but\r\nhave become accurately and positively _known_, so as to be demonstrable\r\nto all intelligent minds and invariably recognized by them as true when\r\nrightly apprehended and understood. In the absence, however, of any\r\nclear conception of what constitutes _knowledge_, of where the dividing\r\nline between it and opinion lay, departments of the universe of\r\nintelligence almost wholly wanting in exactness and certainty have been\r\ndignified with the same title which we apply to departments most\r\npositively _known_. We hear of the Science of Mathematics, the Science\r\nof Chemistry, the Science of Medicine, the Science of Political Economy,\r\nand even of the Science of Theology.\r\n\r\nThis vague use of the word Science is not confined to general custom\r\nonly, but appertains as well to Scientists and writers on scientific\r\nsubjects. So general is this indistinct understanding of the meaning of\r\nthis term, that there does not exist in the range of scientific\r\nliterature a precise, compact, exhaustive, intelligible definition of\r\nit. In order, therefore, to approach our present subject with clear\r\nmental vision, we must gain an accurate conception of the character and\r\nconstituents of Science.\r\n\r\nIn his _History of the Inductive Sciences_, Professor Whewell says:\r\n\r\n     'In the first place, then, I remark, that to the formation of\r\n     science, two things are requisite:--Facts and Ideas; observation of\r\n     Things without, and an inward effort of Thought; or, in other\r\n     words, Sense and Reason. Neither of these elements, by itself, can\r\n     constitute substantial general knowledge. The impression of sense,\r\n     unconnected by some rational and speculative principle, can only\r\n     end in a practical acquaintance with individual objects; the\r\n     operations of the rational faculties, on the other hand, if allowed\r\n     to go on without a constant reference of external things, can lead\r\n     only to empty abstraction and barren ingenuity. Real speculative\r\n     knowledge demands the combination of the two ingredients--right\r\n     reason and facts to reason upon. It has been well said, that true\r\n     knowledge is the interpretation of nature; and therefore it\r\n     requires both the interpreting mind, and nature for its subject,\r\n     both the document, and ingenuity to read it aright. Thus invention,\r\n     acuteness, and connection of thought, are necessary on the one\r\n     hand, for the progress of philosophical knowledge; and on the other\r\n     hand, the precise and steady application of these faculties to\r\n     facts well known and clearly conceived.'\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the nature of Science, more elaborately expanded in\r\n_The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, is limited by its author to\r\nthe Physical Sciences only. In addition to this circumscribed\r\napplication, it is moreover indistinct by reason of the use of the word\r\nIdeas, a word to which so many different significations have been\r\nattached by different writers that its meaning is vague and\r\nundefined--to convey the impression of Laws or Principles. The same\r\ndefect exists in the detailed exposition is perhaps the most extended\r\nand complete extant.\r\n\r\nBut even when we gain a clear conception of the proposition which\r\nProfessor Whewell only vaguely apprehends and therefore does not clearly\r\nstate, namely--that Science is an assemblage of Facts correlated by Laws\r\nor Principles, a system in which the mutual _relations_ of the Facts are\r\nknown, and the Laws or Principles established by them are\r\ndiscovered;--when we understand this ever so distinctly, we are still at\r\nthe beginning of a knowledge of what constitutes Science. When do we\r\nknow that we have a Fact? How are we to be sure that our proof is not\r\ndefective? By what means shall it be certain, beyond the cavil of a\r\ndoubt, that the right Laws or Principles, and no more than those\r\nwarranted by the Facts, are deduced? These and some other questions must\r\nbe definitely settled before we can thoroughly comprehend the nature of\r\nScience, and the consideration of which brings us, in the first place,\r\nto the examination of the characteristics of Scientific Methods.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual development of the world has proceeded under the\r\noperation of three Methods. Two of these, identical in their mode of\r\naction, but arriving, nevertheless, at widely different results, from\r\nthe different points at which they take their departure, are not\r\ncommonly discriminated, but are both included in the technical term\r\n_Deductive Method_. The other is denominated the _Inductive_. A brief\r\nanalysis of these Methods will clear the way for an understanding of the\r\nnature of Science, particularly in its application to the subject of\r\nHistory, with which we are at present especially concerned.\r\n\r\nThe earliest evolution of that which has been called Science,--the\r\nMathematics, which we dismiss for the instant, excepted,--took place\r\nunder the operation of a Method, which, ordinarily confounded with the\r\ntrue Deductive one, is now better known among rigorous Scientists as the\r\nHypothetical or Anticipative Method. This has two modes of expression,\r\none of which consists in the assumption of Laws or Principles, which\r\nhave not been adequately verified, or in the erection of fanciful\r\nhypotheses, as the starting points of reasoning for the purpose of\r\nestablishing other Facts. The second and most common operation referred\r\nto this Method, which is, however, strictly speaking, an imperfect\r\napplication of the Inductive Method, is _to draw conclusions from Facts\r\nwhich these do not warrant_--sometimes conclusions not related to the\r\nFacts, oftener those which, being so related, are a step beyond the\r\nlegitimate inferences which the Facts authorize, though in the same\r\ndirection. This results in the establishment of Laws or Principles as\r\ntrue, which are by no means proven, many of which are subsequently found\r\nto be incorrect. It is to this operation of the Hypothetical Method that\r\nProfessor Whewell, who does not discriminate the two, refers when he\r\ndescribes the defect in the physical speculations of the Greek\r\nphilosophers to have been, 'that though they had in their possession\r\nFacts and Ideas, _the Ideas were not distinct and appropriate to the\r\nFacts_.' The main cause of defect in the mental process here employed is\r\nthe tendency of the human mind to generalize at too early a stage of the\r\ninvestigation, and consequently upon a too narrow basis of Facts.\r\n\r\nThis Method characterized the intellectual activity of the race from the\r\nearliest beginnings of thought up to a period which is commonly said to\r\nhave commenced with the publication of the _Novum Organum_ of Lord\r\nBacon. It was of course fruitless of _Scientific_ results, as it was not\r\na Scientific, but an absolutely Unscientific Method, since _certainty_\r\nis the basis of all Science, and since a Method which attempts to deduce\r\nFacts from Principles which are not ascertained to be Principles, or\r\nPrinciples from an insufficient accumulation of Facts, cannot insure\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt is common to aver that the Anticipative or Hypothetical Method failed\r\nto secure distinct and established verities, and thus to answer the\r\npurpose of a guide to knowledge, because it neglected Facts, disregarded\r\nexperience, and endeavored to spin philosophy out of the unverified\r\nthoughts of men. Professor Whewell, in the two able and valuable works\r\nto which we have referred, has shown that this was not the case among\r\nthe Greeks, at least, whose Philosophy 'did, in its opinions, recognize\r\nthe necessity and paramount value of observation; did, in its origin,\r\nproceed upon observed Facts, and did employ itself to no small extent in\r\nclassifying and arranging phenomena;' and furthermore, 'that Aristotle,\r\nand other ancient philosophers, not only asserted in the most pointed\r\nmanner that all our knowledge must begin from experience, but also\r\nstated, in language much resembling the habitual phraseology of the most\r\nmodern schools of philosophizing, that particular facts must be\r\n_collected_; that from these, general principles must be obtained by\r\ninduction; and that these principles, when of the most general kind, are\r\n_axioms_.'\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thought which has existed and, to a considerable\r\nextent, still exists, even among Scientific men, in relation to the\r\nnature of this Method, arises from the want of an understanding of its\r\ntwofold mode of operation, as just explained. The assertion of those\r\nwho ascribe the failure of this Method to its neglect of Facts, is true;\r\nthe averment of Professor Whewell that it was neither from a lack of\r\nFacts nor Ideas, but because the Ideas were not distinct and appropriate\r\nto the Facts, is not less so. But the former statement applies to that\r\nphase of the Method which assumed unverified Laws or Principles, or\r\nfanciful hypotheses, as the starting points of reasoning without\r\nreference to Facts; while the latter refers to the process, which, while\r\nit collected Facts and derived Laws therefrom, did not stop at the\r\ninferences which were warranted by the Facts. This last was the mode of\r\napplying the Method most in vogue with Aristotle and the Greek\r\nScientists; while the first was preëminently, almost exclusively, the\r\nprocess of the Greek Philosophers and the mediæval Schoolmen.\r\n\r\nBut while the endeavor to arrive at certain knowledge by the Deductive\r\nMethod, by attempting to reason from Principles to Facts, from Generals\r\nto Particulars, failed so completely as far as the Anticipative or\r\nHypothetical branch, of the Method was concerned, the same mode of\r\nprocedure was productive of the most satisfactory results when applied\r\nto Mathematics, and furnished a rapid and easy means of arriving at the\r\nulterior Facts of this department of the universe with precision and\r\ncertainty. We have thus the curious exhibition of the same process\r\nleading into utter confusion when applied to one set of phenomena, and\r\ninto exactitude and surety when applied to another; and behold the\r\nScientific world condemning as utterly useless for other departments of\r\ninvestigation, and throwing aside, a Method which is still retained in\r\nthe only Science that is called _exact_, and in which proof amounts to\r\n_demonstration_, in the strict sense of the term. This anomaly will be\r\nrecurred to and explained farther on.\r\n\r\nSoon after the invention of printing, with its resulting multiplication\r\nof books and increased intellectual activity, the mind of Europe began\r\nto emerge from the deep darkness in which it had been shrouded for\r\ncenturies, and a number of great intellects engaged in the search after\r\nknowledge by the close and laborious examination of the actual\r\nexistences and operations of nature around them. Leonardo da Vinci and\r\nGalileo in Italy; Copernicus, Kepler, and Tycho Brahe in Central Europe;\r\nand Gilbert in England, peered into the hidden depths of the universe,\r\ncollected Facts, and established those Principles which are the\r\nfoundations of the magnificent structures of modern Astronomy and\r\nPhysics. About the same time, Francis Bacon put forth the formal and\r\nelaborate statement of that Method of acquiring knowledge which is often\r\ncalled after him the Baconian, but more commonly the Inductive Method;\r\nsubstantially the Method pursued by the great scientific dicoverers whom\r\nwe have just named.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of this Method is the precise Observation of Facts or\r\nPhenomena and the Induction (drawing in) or accumulation of these\r\naccurate Observations as the basis of knowledge. (This is seemingly the\r\nfirst or etymological reason for the use of the term _Induction_; a term\r\nsubsequently transferred, as we shall see, to the establishment of the\r\nLaws, from which then _ulterior_ Facts are to be _deduced_.) When a\r\nsufficient number of Facts have been accumulated and classified in any\r\nsphere of investigation, and these are found uniformly to reveal the\r\nsame Law or Principle, it is assumed that all similar Phenomena are\r\ninvariably governed by this Principle or Law, which, in reality\r\n_deduced_ or derived, is, by this inversion of terms, said to be\r\n_induced_ from the observed Facts. The Law so established has\r\nthenceforth two distinct functions: I, all the Facts of subsequent\r\nObservation, by the primitive Method of observation, are ranged under\r\nthe Law which, to this extent, serves merely as a superior mode of\r\nclassification; and, II, the Law itself, now assumed to be known and\r\ninfallible, becomes an instrument of prevision and the consequent\r\ndiscovery through it of new Facts, the same which were meant by the\r\nexpression 'ulterior Facts' above used. It is this _deduction_ of new\r\nFacts from an established Law which constitutes the true and legitimate\r\nDeductive Method of Science, the third of the three Methods above stated\r\nand the one which, as has been pointed out, is often erroneously\r\nconfounded with the Anticipative or Hypothetical Method.\r\n\r\nThe mode of investigation by the Inductive Method is, therefore, in\r\ngeneral, similar to that which Aristotle and the Greek Scientists\r\nadopted. It first Observes and Collects Facts; then it resorts to\r\nClassification for the purpose of discovering the Law by which the\r\nobserved Facts are regulated; then _derives_ from this Classification a\r\nGeneral Law, presumed to be applicable to all similar Facts, although\r\nthey have not yet been observed; and, finally, _deduces_ from the\r\nGeneral Law thus established, new Facts and Particulars, by bringing\r\nthem in under the Law.\r\n\r\nThe Inductive Method is, therefore, almost identical in its mode of\r\nprocedure with one of the processes anciently adopted for the\r\nacquisition of knowledge under the Anticipative or Hypothetical Method.\r\nIt failed of fruitful results, in this earlier age, because, as we have\r\nseen, men were not content with adhering rigorously and patiently to the\r\nlogical, irresistible conclusions which Facts evolved, but sought to\r\nwrench from them Principles, which required for their establishment a\r\nwider or different range of phenomena. On the revival of this Method\r\namong the modern Scientists, it was conceived, especially by Bacon, that\r\na rigid adhesion to the legitimate deductions of Facts and a faithful\r\nexclusion from the domain of knowledge of everything which did _not_\r\nlogically and inevitably result from the Observation and Classification\r\nof Facts, was the only safe way to arrive at certainty in any department\r\nof thought. It is this fidelity to conclusions rigorously derived from\r\nFacts, and the severe exclusion of everything not clearly substantiated\r\nby Observation, Classification, and Induction, which has given us the\r\nbody of proximately definite knowledge that we now possess, and which,\r\nso far as it has been persevered in, has been productive of such\r\nbeneficial intellectual results.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of this Inductive Method new Sciences have been\r\ngradually generated, whose foundations and Principles are capable of\r\nsuch a degree of satisfactory proof as the Method itself affords. During\r\nthe present century, Auguste Comte, a distinguished French philosopher,\r\noften denominated the Bacon of our epoch, the special champion of the\r\nInductive Method, has undertaken, for our day, the task which his\r\nillustrious English predecessor attempted for his, namely--an Inventory\r\nand Classification of our intellectual stores. He endeavored to bring\r\nthe Scientific world up to the _practical_ recognition of that which\r\nthey had _theoretically_ maintained since Bacon's time,--that nothing\r\ndeserves to be considered as true, which cannot be undoubtedly,\r\nconclusively established by inference, from the Facts of Experience,--a\r\ntheory to which they had never strictly adhered. He insisted that all\r\nTheological, Metaphysical, and Transcendental Speculations were wholly\r\nbeyond the range of exact inquiry, and should therefore be excluded from\r\nthe domain in which human knowledge was to be sought; and that\r\ninvestigation should be confined to those regions of thought and\r\nactivity which were within the limits of precise apprehension. Upon this\r\nclear, logical and right application of the Inductive Method, Comte\r\nbased his Classification of our existing knowledge. He denominated as\r\n_Positive_ Sciences those systems of Principles and correlated Facts,\r\ncomprising Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Biology,\r\nSociology, and their derivative domains, which were founded on the exact\r\nObservation of Phenomena, and set aside all other realms of the universe\r\nof thought as departments in which _exact_ knowledge was impossible, and\r\nwhose intellectual examination was therefore fruitless. The Philosophy\r\nbased on this critical Method was denominated by its founder Positivism.\r\nAll modern Scientists, with rare exceptions, whether they are disciples\r\nof Comte or not, are theoretical Positivists in their modes of\r\ninvestigation, in their unwillingness to accept theories not proven, in\r\ntheir partiality for Facts, and in their devotion to the Inductive\r\nMethod, although the nature of _proof_ is still but dimly comprehended\r\nby them as a body, and much laxity creeps into their practical efforts\r\nat demonstration. Under the influence of Positivism, however, the\r\nScientific field is being rapidly cleared of unestablished theories\r\nwhich formerly mingled with it, claiming to be an integral part of its\r\narea, and the boundaries of Science are becoming more closely defined.\r\nThe Inductive Method is enthusiastically eulogized as the source of the\r\nsuccess of modern Scientific investigators, as the true Scientific\r\nMethod, and--except among a few of the most advanced thinkers--as the\r\nfinal word of wisdom in regard to the manner of establishing definite\r\nand exact knowledge. The Deductive, often called the _à priori_\r\nMethod--in which term the Anticipative or Hypothetical and the true\r\nDeductive Method, seen in Mathematical investigations, are not\r\nsufficiently discriminated--is, on the other hand, almost everywhere\r\ndenounced as essentially false, the source of all error; and we are\r\nassured that the attempt to work it was the fault of the old world,\r\nprior to Bacon, and the cause of its failure to secure great\r\nintellectual results.\r\n\r\nA distinguished thinker, Stephen Pearl Andrews, from whose writings some\r\nof these suggestions concerning Methods have been borrowed, points out\r\nthree sources of confusion in the minds even of the learned themselves,\r\nin connection with this subject. First, in the verbal point of view, the\r\nterms Induction and Deduction are applied in a way directly the opposite\r\nof that which their Etymology would indicate: _In_-duction is used for\r\nthe _De_-rivation of a Law from Facts, and _De_-duction for the\r\n_Intro_-duction of new Facts under the Law. Secondly, the two terms\r\nInductive and Deductive, which are alone usually spoken of, are not\r\nenough to designate all the processes involved in the several Scientific\r\nMethods; and, thirdly, these terms are sometimes used to denote\r\n_Processes_ merely, and sometimes to designate Methods which are merely\r\ncharacterized by the predominance of one or the other of these\r\nProcesses.\r\n\r\nThis intricate subject of Methods may be better understood after a\r\nstatement of the following considerations. Induction, as a _Process_,\r\noccurs whenever Facts are used as an instrument by which to discover a\r\nPrinciple or Law of Nature. The Principle is derived from, or, as\r\nScientists have chosen to conceive it, _induced upon_ the Facts.\r\nDeduction, as a _Process_, occurs whenever a Principle or Law of Nature\r\nis used as an instrument by which to discover Facts. The new Facts are\r\nranged under, or, as it is conceived, _deduced from_ the Principle.\r\n\r\nEach, of these Processes occurs in _every_ Scientific Method; but\r\ndifferent Methods are _characterised_ by that one of these two Processes\r\nwhich is _put first or takes the lead in the given Method_. Thus, in\r\nboth Methods which are included in the one generally called the\r\nDeductive, the main Process was _Deduction_, there being no perceptible\r\n_Induction_ from Collected Facts in the proper Hypothetical or\r\nAnticipative Method, while in the true Deductive Method, as applied to\r\nMathematics, the Inductive stage is so short and so slight that it is\r\nperformed instinctively by all people and the Deductive stage at once\r\nreached. The other branch of the Hypothetical Method, that used by\r\nAristotle and the Greek Scientists, was, as we have seen, in reality a\r\nfirst and imperfect attempt to use the Inductive Method. In this Method\r\nitself, on the other hand, the main Process is the _Induction_ or\r\nderivation of a Principle or Law from accumulated Facts, while\r\n_Deduction_, or the bringing in of new Facts under the Law, is a\r\nsubordinate or Secondary Process.\r\n\r\nIn reality, there is but ONE Method, having several stages or\r\n_Processes_, which Processes, preponderating at different epochs, have\r\nnot been clearly apprehended as necessary complements of each other, and\r\nhave, hence, been regarded as different Methods. In one phase of the\r\nAnticipative or Hypothetical stage,--the assumption of basic Principles\r\nas points to reason from,--the Observation and Collection of Facts, and\r\nthe Induction therefrom, were processes so imperfectly performed, that\r\nthey appeared to have no existence; in another phase, that employed by\r\nAristotle, these Processes were apparent, but still imperfectly\r\nconducted, and hence, in both cases, the Law or Principle employed for\r\nthe _Deductive_ Process was liable to be defective, and therefore\r\ninsufficient as a guide to the acquisition of certain knowledge. In the\r\nInductive stage or Method, on the other hand, the Processes thus\r\ndefectively employed in the former stage, the Hypothetical, are\r\npreëminently and disproportionately active, while the Deductive Process\r\nis given a very inferior position. The establishment of the just,\r\nreciprocal activity of these two Processes in intellectual investigation\r\nwould secure the perfection of the _one true Scientific Method_.\r\n\r\nThe Inductive Method--preserving the term Method to avoid confusion--in\r\nwhich the mode of procedure from Facts to Principles predominates, and\r\nwhich is hence sometimes called the Empirical, or the Experimental, or\r\nthe Positive, or the _à posteriori_ Method, is that which now prevails\r\nin the world, which is extolled as if it were the only legitimate\r\nMethod, and the only possible route to Scientific Discovery. That the\r\njust claims of the Inductive Method are very great is universally\r\nadmitted, but let us not stultify ourselves by assuming a position in\r\nits defence which is in direct violation of the teachings of the Method\r\nitself,--namely, the assumption of a theory which is not verified by\r\nFacts. That the Inductive Method is vastly superior to the Anticipative\r\nor Hypothetical one, is abundantly proved; but that it is the _only_\r\ncorrect path to Scientific truth, that it is the best path to Scientific\r\ntruth which will ever be known, or that in a rightly balanced Method it\r\nwould be the _main_ Process, is an averment for which there is no\r\nwarrant. On the contrary, a very cursory examination of the Inductive\r\nMethod will show defects which render it unavailable as the sole or the\r\nchief guide in Scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe leading characteristic of the Inductive Method, that for which it is\r\nmainly admired, is its cautious, laborious, oftentimes tedious\r\nObservation and Collection of the Facts of Experience, and their careful\r\nClassification as a basis for the derivation of a Principle or Law\r\napplicable to the Phenomena grouped together. By this means, it is said,\r\nwe secure precision and _certainty_, by which is intended, not only the\r\n_certainty of that which is already observed and classified_, but also\r\n_the certainty of that which is deduced from the Law or Principle\r\nderived from these known Facts_. It is just here, however, that the\r\nInductive Method is lacking. Experience may testify a thousand, ten\r\nthousand, any indefinite number of times, to the repetition of the same\r\nPhenomena, and yet we can have no _certainty_ of the recurrence of the\r\nsame Phenomena, in the future, in the same way. All the Facts of\r\nObservation and Experience for thousands of years went to convince men\r\nthat the earth was at rest and the sun and stars passing around it. A\r\nlarger Experience showed them their error. How shall we know that our\r\nObservation has at any time included all the Facts necessary to\r\nestablish a Law? The history of Science, even under the guidance of the\r\nInductive Method, is a history of Principles announced as firmly\r\nestablished, which a little later were found to be defective and had to\r\nbe adjusted to the advanced stage of human Experience. The very nature\r\nof the Inductive Method indicates its inadequacy for the largest and\r\nmost important purposes of Science. It gives certainty, where it does\r\ngive it, only up to the point of the present, _it can never afford\r\ncomplete certainty for the future_. The logical and rigid testimony of\r\nthis Method can never be more than this;--Observation and Experience\r\nshow that such has been the uniform operation of Nature in this\r\nparticular _so far as can be discovered_, and _in all probability_ it\r\nwill always continue to be such. _High Probability_, amounting, it may\r\nbe, at times, to an assurance of certainty, is the strongest proof which\r\nthis Method can, from its very nature, produce. To establish a Principle\r\nor Law for a _certainty beyond any possibility of doubt_ by the\r\nInductive Method, it is essential that we should know that we are in\r\npossession of every Fact in the universe which has any relation to the\r\ngiven Principle, or rather that we should know that there are _no_ Facts\r\nin the universe at variance with it. To _know_ this, it is necessary to\r\nbe in possession of _all_ the Facts in the universe, since the Inductive\r\nMethod has no mode of discovering when it has sifted out of the immense\r\nmass of Facts all those which exist in connection with any given Law. As\r\nwe shall _never_ be in possession of all the Facts of the universe, we\r\nshall never be able, by the Inductive Method, to possess _certainty_ in\r\nrespect to the future operations of Nature; and thus we discover the\r\ninsufficiency of this Method as a perfect guide to the acquisition of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe famed Inductive Method, like the Anticipative or Hypothetical,\r\nfurnishes, in truth, only an _assumption_ as a starting point for\r\nreasoning in the endeavor to establish other Facts than those already\r\nknown. The verification of the Law or Principle assumed is, indeed, in\r\nthe former Method, as complete as it can be, in the nature of the case,\r\nwhile in the latter it is not; but we have just seen that the strongest\r\nproof which Observation, Classification, and Induction can give is that\r\nof High Probability, on the _supposition_ that a certain number of Facts\r\nfrom which a Law is derived include substantially all that the whole\r\nrange of Phenomena belonging to the given sphere would represent. Any\r\npossible application of the Inductive Method is, therefore, only a\r\nnearer or more remote approximation to an Exactitude and Certainty which\r\nthe Method itself can never _fully_ attain.\r\n\r\nThe Inductive Method being thus defective as a Scientific guide, in the\r\nmost important requirement of Science, it is unnecessary to enter into\r\nan exposition of minor defects, not the least of which is the _slowness_\r\nwith which conclusions must necessarily be arrived at, when they are\r\nreached only by the gradual accumulation of Facts and the derivation of\r\na Law from these. A Method or a Process which lacks that which is the\r\nvery essence of Science--the power of making _known_, of introducing\r\n_certainty_ into investigation, may be an important factor in the _true\r\nScientific_ Method, but cannot constitute the _Method itself_, or its\r\n_leading_ feature. Let it not be understood, however, that in bringing\r\nthe Inductive Method in Science to the ordeal of a critical examination,\r\nit is designed to detract from its just dues or to depreciate its true\r\nvalue. Science is preëminently severe in its probings; and that which,\r\nasserts its claim to the highest Scientific position, and affects to be\r\nthe only guide to exact knowledge, cannot expect anything less than the\r\nmost rigorous inquiry into the validity of such claim, and the most\r\nperemptory insistence upon the production of proper credentials before\r\nso lofty a seat be accorded it. If inquiry discovers deficiencies in its\r\ncharacter, Science should rejoice that truth is vindicated, and that, by\r\ncorrectly understanding the nature and powers of their present guide,\r\nScientific men may avoid being tempted to consider it as competent to\r\nconduct them into regions where the blind must inevitably be leading the\r\nblind, and both be in danger of the ditch. If the devotees of the\r\nInductive Method have in their enthusiasm set up claims for it which\r\ncannot be substantiated, they must not blame the rigorous hand, which,\r\nin the service of Science, unmasks their idol and exhibits its defects,\r\nbut rather impute to their own deviation from the severity of Scientific\r\ntruth, the disappointment which they may experience. The question of\r\nMethod lies at the foundation of all Science. Until it is thoroughly\r\nunderstood, until the exact character of all our Methods or Processes is\r\ndefinitely and rightly apprehended, there can be no full understanding\r\nof the true nature of Science, and, hence, no critical and exact line\r\ndrawn between that which is Science and that which is not.\r\n\r\nOur examination of the Methods in use thus far in our past search after\r\nknowledge has developed these facts:--that prior to an era which is\r\ncommonly said to commence with Bacon, the Method of intellectual\r\ninvestigation was _mainly_ by attempting to proceed from Principles to\r\nFacts, and that the attempt exhibits three distinct phases: one, in\r\nwhich the Induction stage is so simple and so short as to be\r\ninstinctively and correctly performed by all people, and the Deductive\r\nstage at once reached--this furnishes the Mathematics, the only Science\r\nin which hitherto the _true_ Deductive Method has prevailed; a second,\r\nin which Principles are assumed to reason from, without any previous\r\neffort at Induction, such as existed, being unconsciously made from the\r\nsupposed Facts or Knowledge which the mind was in possession of; and a\r\nthird, in which Facts were collected, classified, and Induction\r\ntherefrom as a basis of further investigation attempted, but in which\r\nthe Laws or Principles assumed as established by the Facts were not\r\nrigorously and accurately derived from Facts; or, in other words, in\r\nwhich the Facts were not strictly used for the purpose of deriving from\r\nthem just such Laws or Principles only as they actually established, but\r\nwere wrenched to the attempted support of Laws, Principles, or Ideas\r\nmore or less fanciful or unrelated to the Facts. These two last phases\r\nare included in what is known among Scientists as the Anticipative or\r\nHypothetical Method; while the three phases are commonly undiscriminated\r\nand collectively termed the Deductive Method. It was also developed that\r\nthe results of this period of intellectual activity were fruitless of\r\ndefinite Scientific achievements, _except so far as the true Deductive\r\nMethod_ had been employed. It was furthermore seen that since Bacon's\r\ntime, the opposite Method of procedure, namely, from Facts to\r\nPrinciples, has been chiefly in vogue; that under its impulse\r\ndistinctness and clearness have been brought to pervade those stores of\r\nknowledge which were already in our possession, thus fulfilling _one_ of\r\nthe requisites of a perfect Scientific Method, while, however, the other\r\nnecessary requirement, that of furnishing a _certain_ guide to future\r\ndiscoveries, has been only proximately attained by it.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from this exhibition of the characteristics of the two\r\nleading Scientific Methods, or the two leading Processes of the one\r\nMethod, in whichever light we may choose to view them, that so far from\r\nbeing the best or the only true Method or Process of intellectual\r\ninvestigation, the Inductive is far inferior to the _true Deductive_\r\nMethod or Process, in all the essentials of a Scientific guide. The\r\nInductive can give us only a _high degree_ of precision and\r\ndefiniteness, with only proximate certainty for the future as the result\r\nof a slow mode of procedure; while the true Deductive Method gives us\r\nperfect precision, exactitude, and complete certainty, as the result of\r\na rapid mode. The true Deductive Method--brought into disrepute by being\r\nconfounded with the Anticipative or Hypothetical, which differs from it\r\nonly in this, that the Principles from which the latter reasons are\r\n_true_, while those of the former are _doubtful_--has thus far prevailed\r\nin Mathematics alone, and _Mathematics_ is, up to our day, _the only\r\nrecognized Exact Science_, the only Science in which _Demonstration_, in\r\nthe strict sense of that term, is now possible,--the fruits of the\r\nInductive Method being known as the _Inexact_ Sciences, in which only\r\nProbable Reasoning prevails.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to say, in the _strict sense of the term_, because the\r\nsame laxity exists in the use of the word _Demonstration_, as in that of\r\nScience, and hence it has lost the distinctive meaning which attaches to\r\nit, in its legitimate use, as signifying a mode of reasoning in which\r\nthe _self-evident truths or axioms_, with which we start, and every step\r\nin the deduction, 'are not only perfectly definite, but incapable of\r\nbeing apprehended differently--if really apprehended, they must be\r\napprehended alike by all and at all times.' It is because this Method of\r\nproof exists only in Mathematics, that this alone is denominated the\r\n_Exact_ Science, or its branches, the Exact Sciences; Sciences whose\r\nLaws or Principles, and the Facts connected with or deduced from them,\r\nare irresistible conclusions of thought, in all minds, which conclusions\r\nrest upon universally recognized axioms; while the _Inexact Sciences_,\r\nincluding all except Mathematics, the Sciences in which the Inductive\r\nMethod prevails, are systems of Laws or Principles, with their related\r\nFacts, of the truth of which there is great probability, but of which\r\nthere is, nevertheless, no complete certainty; whose conclusions are not\r\n_based_ upon universally undeniable axioms, or are not _themselves_\r\nirresistible to the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Deductive Method, both in its mode of advancing\r\nto the discovery of new truth and in the precision, clearness, and\r\ncertainty which accompany its findings, must now easily become apparent.\r\nWhether we regard Induction and Deduction as correlative Processes\r\nbelonging to one Method, each of which has been disproportionately in\r\nvogue at different epochs, or as distinctive Methods, having each their\r\nown Deductive and Inductive Processes, in either aspect, Induction is\r\nonly a preparative labor, leading in the more important work of the\r\napplication of the Law or Principle derived. It is only, indeed, for the\r\npurpose of discovering this Law that Observation, Classification, and\r\nInduction are undertaken. It has been the triumphant boast of the\r\nInductive Method, that it guarded, by means of these preliminary steps,\r\nin the most careful manner, against error in establishing its Laws. To\r\nthe extent of its capacity it has done so. But we have already seen,\r\nthat deriving its Principles, as it was obliged to, from less than _all_\r\nthe Facts which appertained to the Principles, these must inevitably\r\nhave been lacking in some particulars; it being impossible to make the\r\nwhole out of less than all its parts.\r\n\r\nThe Inductive Method has obtained an importance greatly exaggerated, for\r\nthe reason that it has been brought into comparison, for the most part,\r\nwith the Anticipative or Hypothetical, the bastard Deductive Method\r\nonly, and its superiority over this exhibited in the most detailed\r\nmanner, while the right application of the Deductive Method, except in\r\nMathematics, has not been considered possible. The reason of this can be\r\nmade obvious.\r\n\r\nThe immense superiority of _Mathematical_ Reasoning, as _Demonstration_\r\nis often called, over all other kinds, is universally known and\r\nrecognized. For in this mode of reasoning there is no room for doubt or\r\nuncertainty. It starts from Principles of whose truth there can be no\r\ndoubt, because it is impossible for _the human mind to apprehend them in\r\nmore than one way_, and proceeds by steps, every one of which can\r\nlikewise be apprehended in only one way. Hence all men arrive\r\n_inevitably_ at the same conclusion at the close of the chain of\r\nreasoning. It is, therefore, a Method of proof which sets out from a\r\nprecise, definite, universally established Law or Principle which really\r\ncontains the conclusion in itself, and which can be developed to the end\r\nthrough a series of necessary and irresistible convincements; while in\r\nthe Inductive Method we are obliged to start from this or that admitted\r\nFact or Truth assumed after Observation, Classification, and Induction,\r\nwhich may have been rigorously performed, but which, nevertheless, could\r\nnot, in the nature of the case, prove the Fact or Truth with complete\r\ncertainty, and which is not, perhaps, universally admitted, and proceed\r\nby merely probable inferences drawn from various, diverse, and often\r\nuncertain relations, until we reach a conclusion. Such reasoning may be\r\nsufficient to incline the mind to a particular conclusion, as against\r\nthose which tend to any other conclusion, but they are never quite\r\nsufficient, as in Demonstrative or _true_ Deductive reasoning, to\r\n_necessitate_ the conclusion, and render any other impossible.\r\n\r\nA Method of Scientific investigation which proceeds from self-evident\r\ntruths to necessary results by undeniable steps, would of course be\r\npreferable to one which, starting from truths whose precision and\r\ncertainty might be doubtful, advances by more or less probable\r\ninferences to a more or less probable conclusion, did there not exist\r\nsome powerful cause for a contrary action. A difficulty thus far\r\ninsurmountable has, indeed, stood in the way of the adoption of the\r\nDeductive Method in any department of investigation, save the one\r\nalready referred to. This Method, we have seen, leads to truth or error\r\naccordingly as the Principles or Laws from which it commences its\r\nreasoning process are true or false. In the Mathematics, the basic\r\ntruths, being of a simple character, were arrived at by easy and\r\ninstinctive mental processes, and the Method achieved in this department\r\ngreat success. But the other domains of human knowledge being more\r\ncomplex, involving more qualities or characteristics than mere Number\r\nand Form and Force, which are all that come within the scope of\r\nMathematics, their fundamental bases or truths were not so easily\r\nattainable. Hence, when Principles or Ideas which men believed to\r\ncontain all the fundamentals of a specific domain of thought were\r\nadopted as starting points of reasoning, they were generally lacking in\r\nsome important element, which caused the conclusion to be in some way\r\nincorrect. We have seen the historical results of this mode of procedure\r\nin what is denominated the Anticipative or Hypothetical Method. The\r\nfailure of this to secure good results, and the absence of any standard\r\nby which to be certain when a Law or Principle was fundamental, exact,\r\nand inclusive, when it was a valid basis to reason from, led to the\r\nabandonment of the Deductive Method, except in its application to\r\nMathematics, where true starting points were known. The Observation and\r\nClassification of Facts was then resorted to, first, in a loose way, in\r\nGreece, and afterward, in a more rigorous way, in the world at large,\r\nfor the purpose of endeavoring to discover, by the only mode considered\r\neffective--the examination of Phenomena--the fundamental Principles,\r\nwhich, like those of Mathematics, should include all the essentials of\r\nthe special domain under consideration. These being discovered, might\r\nfurnish, it was instinctively felt, starting points from which to work\r\nthe Deductive Process, with the same success as that which attended its\r\napplication to Mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe Inductive Principle, considered either as a Process or a Method, is\r\nvaluable, therefore, mainly as it furnishes proper starting points for\r\nthe activity of the Deductive Principle. Thus far in the history of the\r\nNatural Sciences it has been the best and safest guide in affording such\r\nstarting points. But the indications are numerous all about us that the\r\nprogress of Scientific discovery will ere long bring us to a stage,\r\nwhere the Laws or Principles which underlie every department of the\r\nUniverse being fully revealed, the function of the Inductive Principle\r\nas a guide to fundamental bases, will be at an end, and the Deductive\r\nMethod once more assume the leadership, opening to us all departments of\r\ninvestigation, with the rapidity, precision, and certainty which\r\ncharacterize Mathematical research and Demonstrative Reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis _desideratum_ must necessarily result whenever a Unitary Law shall\r\nbe discovered in Science; whenever the Sciences, and the Phenomena\r\nwithin the different Sciences, shall be _basically_ connected. All the\r\npresent conditions and tendencies of knowledge indicate that the\r\nattainment of this crowning intellectual goal was predestined to our\r\nepoch. It has been the grand work of the Inductive Method to arrange\r\nFacts under Principles, and these latter as Facts or Truths under a\r\nsmaller number of Principles, and these in turn under a still smaller\r\nnumber, until all the Phenomena of the different domains of thought\r\nwhich are reckoned as Sciences are included within a few Principles\r\nwhich lie at the foundation of each domain. The connection of these few\r\nPrinciples by a still more fundamental Law, is all that is necessary to\r\nthe completion of the work of the centuries and the establishment of a\r\nUniversal or Unitary Science. Already those recognized as leaders in the\r\nScientific world watch expectantly the signs of the times and await the\r\nadvent of the Grand Discovery which is to usher in a new intellectual\r\nera, 'We have reached the point,' says Agassiz, in one of his _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_ articles, 'where the results of Science _touch the very problem\r\nof existence, and all men listen for the solving of that mystery_. When\r\nit will come, and how, none can say; but this much, at least, is\r\ncertain, _that all our researches are leading up to that question_, and\r\nmankind will never rest till it is answered.'\r\n\r\n'All the Phenomena of Physics,' says Professor Silliman, in his _First\r\nPrinciples of Philosophy_, 'are dependent on a limited number of general\r\nlaws, _of which they are the necessary consequences_. However various\r\nand complex may be the phenomena, their laws are few, and distinguished\r\nfor their exceeding simplicity. All of them may be represented by\r\nnumbers and algebraic symbols, and these condensed _formulæ_ enable us\r\nto conduct investigations _with the certainty and precision of pure\r\nMathematics_. As in geometry, all the properties of figures are deduced\r\nfrom a few axioms and definitions; so _when the general laws of Physics\r\nare known, we may deduce from them, by a series of rigorous reasonings,\r\nall the phenomena to which they give rise_.'\r\n\r\nAuguste Comte, in his elaborate and encyclopædic _Course of Positive\r\nPhilosophy_, tells us that 'these _three_ laws [the Law of Inertia, the\r\nLaw of the Equality of action and reaction, and the Law of the\r\nComposition of forces] are the experimental basis of the Science of\r\nMechanics. From them the mind may proceed _to the logical construction\r\nof the Science, without further reference to the external world_. * * *\r\nWe cannot, however, conceive of any case which is not met by these three\r\nlaws of Kepler, of Newton, and of Galileo, and their expression is so\r\nprecise that they can be immediately treated in the form of analytical\r\nequations easily obtained.' While also exhibiting the small number of\r\nPrinciples which lie at the foundation of other domains of our\r\nintellectual accumulations, Comte remarks: 'The ultimate perfection of\r\nthe Positive system would be (if such perfection could be hoped for) to\r\nrepresent all phenomena as particular aspects of a single general\r\nfact;--such as Gravitation, for instance.'\r\n\r\nThese are a few specimens of what may be found in the books, pointing\r\nout the gradual approach of Scientific investigation to the discovery of\r\na Unitary Law, and the expectation among Scientists of the advent, at\r\nsome period not far distant, of a new Science, the greatest among\r\nSciences, a true Pantology or Universology. Upon the apprehension of\r\nthis Law, which must establish the true basis of every domain of thought\r\nor activity, and show it to be identical or analogous in the several\r\ndomains, we shall be placed, _in relation to the whole universe_,\r\nprecisely where we now stand in relation to Mathematics, Mechanics, and\r\nPhysics; that is, the General Law or Laws of every domain of\r\ninvestigation will become known, as we now know those of these Sciences,\r\nand, to adopt the words of the French writer, 'from them the mind may\r\nproceed to the logical construction of the Science [being now the\r\nScience of the whole Universe], without further reference to the\r\nexternal world;' or to use the language of Professor Silliman, 'when the\r\ngeneral laws of [the Universe] are known, we may _deduce_ from them, by\r\na series of rigorous reasonings, _all the phenomena to which they give\r\nrise_.' Thus, upon the discovery of a Unitary Law, linking the Sciences\r\ntogether, and showing the identity of their starting points or bases,\r\nthe Deductive Principle, considered either as a Method or a Process,\r\nmust once more take the lead, and the Inductive occupy its legitimate\r\nposition as a subordinate and corroborative auxiliary. Under the\r\nguidance of this new adjustment of the Deductive and Inductive\r\nPrinciples, a full, exact, complete, definite, _Scientific_\r\nClassification of our knowledge will become possible, and the true\r\nboundaries of every domain of intellectual examination may be critically\r\nand clearly established. In the absence of such a Classification, it is\r\nonly by viewing departments of the Universe with reference to the Method\r\nor Process employed in the investigation of their Phenomena, that we are\r\nable to estimate their present relations to Science, and to ascertain\r\nproximately their Scientific or Unscientific character. We proceed,\r\nthen, to examine the connection of History, in its present development,\r\nwith Science, a task to which the foregoing brief and incomplete\r\nconsideration of the subject of Method has been a necessary preliminary.\r\n\r\nA number of Classifications of human knowledge have been attempted, none\r\nof which were exact or complete, or could have been, for a reason which\r\nwas stated above, and none of which are now considered to be\r\nsatisfactory by the Scientific world. Bacon and D'Alembert, men of\r\nvigorous and vast intellectual capacity, were admirably adapted to such\r\na work, so far as it could be performed in their day. But the state of\r\nknowledge and Scientific progress was not sufficiently advanced, at that\r\ntime, to render any Classification which could be made of more than\r\ntemporary value, and those furnished by these illustrious thinkers now\r\nappertain only to the archæology of Science.\r\n\r\nThe Classification of Auguste Comte, in the absence of a more exact,\r\ncomplete, and inclusive one, still holds the highest rank, and is the\r\nonly one which now claims the attention of the general Thinker. It is\r\nvery restricted in its application, professing to include only the\r\ndomain which Comte calls abstract or general Science, which has for its\r\nobject the discovery of the laws which regulate Phenomena in all\r\nconceivable cases within their domain, and excluding the sphere of what\r\nhe denominates concrete, particular, or descriptive Science, whose\r\nfunction it is to apply these laws to the history of existing beings.\r\nThis throws such Natural Sciences as Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy,\r\nGeology, etc., out of his range. He also excludes the domain of\r\n_practical_ Knowledge, comprising what is included under the terms, the\r\nApplied Sciences, the Arts, the Mechanical Sciences, etc. A\r\nClassification, far more detailed and comprehensive in its scope than\r\nanything yet published, is in preparation by Professor P. H. Vander\r\nWeyde, of the Cooper Institute--advanced sheets of which, so far as it\r\nis elaborated, have been kindly furnished to the writer by the\r\nauthor--the incomplete state of which, however, prevents a further\r\nconsideration here.\r\n\r\nThe Principle which Comte adopted to guide him in his Classification was\r\nthe following: 'All observable phenomena may be included within a very\r\nfew natural categories, so arranged as that the study of each category\r\nmay be grounded on the principal laws of the preceding, and serve as the\r\nbasis of the next ensuing. This order is determined by the degree of\r\nsimplicity, or, what comes to the same thing, of generality of their\r\nphenomena. Hence results their successive dependence, and the greater or\r\nlesser facility for being studied.' In accordance with this Principle,\r\nComte establishes what he denominates the _Hierarchy of the Sciences_.\r\nMathematics stands at the base of this, as being that Science whose\r\nPhenomena are the most general, the most simple, and the most abstract\r\nof all. Astronomy comes next, wherein the Static and Dynamic properties\r\nof the heavenly bodies complicate the nature of the investigation; in\r\nPhysics, Phenomena must be considered in the midst of the still greater\r\ncomplications of Weight, Light, Heat, Sound, etc.; Chemistry has\r\nadditional characteristics to trace in its subjects; Biology adds the\r\nintricacies of vital Phenomena to all below it; and Sociology, the sixth\r\nand last of Comte's Hierarchy--all other departments of thought other\r\nthan those previously excluded from his survey, being regarded as out of\r\nthe bounds of human cognition--deals with the still more complicated\r\nproblem of the relations of men to each other in society.\r\n\r\nThis Classification is admirable for the purpose of showing the mutual\r\ninterdependence of the branches of Knowledge included in it; but aside\r\nfrom its covering only a small part of our intellectual domain, it is\r\nalso defective in not distinguishing with sufficient clearness that\r\nwhich is properly Science, from that which is merely Theory or Plausible\r\nConjecture. Biology and Sociology are classed with Mathematics as\r\n_Positive_ Sciences, as if the Laws or Principles which correlated the\r\nPhenomena of the former were established as certainly and definitely as\r\nthose of the latter; while there is no prominence given to the different\r\nnature of _proof_ in Mathematics and that in every other department of\r\ninvestigation--except in so far as Mathematical Phenomena and Processes\r\nenter into the latter--if, indeed, the founder of Positivism has even\r\nanywhere distinctly stated it. Chemistry, Biology, and Sociology,\r\nleaving Astronomy and Physics aside for the present, are not yet\r\n_Positive_ Sciences, in any such sense as Mathematics. The lack of\r\n_exact_ analysis is apparent in all of Comte's generalizations,\r\notherwise magnificent and masterly as they undoubtedly are. In respect\r\nto the matter under consideration, it renders his Classification\r\nunavailing for determining with sufficient precision and exactitude the\r\ncharacter of any intellectual domain. History, while it is the source\r\nwhence the proof of his fundamental positions is drawn, finds no place\r\nin his Scientific schedule. Even had it been otherwise, the defect just\r\nalluded to would have rendered it useless for our present purposes,\r\nuntil a prior Classification had first been made, exhibiting the radical\r\ndifference between the various domains, which are all indiscriminately\r\ngrouped under the name of _Science_. After such a Classification, based\r\non the nature of _proof_ as involved in Method, the Principle which\r\nguided Comte in the establishment of the Hierarchy of the Sciences will\r\nenable us, in a concluding paper, to estimate with proximate certainty\r\nthe character of a possible Science of History, and to ascertain how far\r\nthe labors of Mr. Buckle and Professor Draper have aided toward the\r\ncreation of such a Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Friday, _April 10th._\r\n\r\nEaster week is over, and I am really sorry; I had found happiness in\r\nrepose, and already have care and disquiet won their way into my heart\r\nand my mind.... How many sins I have committed! Poor humanity! poor\r\nnature, so frail and weak! Notwithstanding my promises and the\r\nresolutions which I fancied so strong, I yield to the least temptation.\r\n\r\nFor example, and it is indeed incredible, but a fact, that on Holy\r\nThursday, the very day after my confession, I sinned, and sinned through\r\npride. I should have worn black when I went to be present at the court\r\nceremony, but I could not resist the seduction of a beautiful costume.\r\nJust as I was beginning my preparations, the Princess Lubomirska entered\r\nmy room, accompanied by her maids, who brought me a charming dress of\r\nwhite velvet, with a long train, and trimmed with white roses; the\r\nheaddress consisted of a garland of white roses, and a long white blonde\r\nveil. The taste and richness of this costume surpasses description! How\r\ncould I resist the happiness of seeing myself so becomingly attired!\r\n\r\nI asked the princess why she required me to wear so brilliant a costume\r\nto church; she replied that on Holy Thursday it was customary after the\r\nservice to go into the great hall of the castle, where the king would\r\nwash the feet of twelve old men, in commemoration of the humility of our\r\nSaviour, and that he would also wait upon them at table. During this\r\npious and edifying ceremony, a young girl belonging to one of the\r\nnoblest families must make a collection for the poor; the king himself\r\nnames the lady, and this year he was pleased to honor me by his\r\nselection; he at the same time announced that the results of my efforts\r\nshould be given to the hospital for the poor under the Abbé Baudoin's\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nI was very happy as I listened to the princess; but, must I confess it?\r\nI was not happy through the good action I was about to perform; I\r\nthought only of myself, of my beauty, of the charming costume, of the\r\neffect I should produce among all the other women dressed in black, and\r\nI rejoiced to think that I should be the most beautiful. What culpable\r\nvanity! And on Holy Thursday! But at least I frankly admit my sin, and\r\nhumiliate myself for it.\r\n\r\nMy collection surpassed my hopes. I received nearly four thousand\r\nducats. Prince Charles Radziwill said, as he put his hand to his purse:\r\n'My dear (Panie Kochanku, his favorite expression), one must give\r\nsomething to so beautiful a lady;' and he threw five hundred gold pieces\r\non my plate, which would have fallen from my hands had I not been aided\r\nin holding it. When I began my collection, I was very much embarrassed;\r\nI trembled all over, and blushed at each new offering I received; but by\r\ndegrees I gained courage, and profited by my dancing master's lessons.\r\nThe grand marshal of the court gave me his hand, and named each lord as\r\nhe repeated the customary formula employed in handing them the plate; as\r\nfor me, I could not have said a word; I found it quite enough to make a\r\nproper and becoming courtesy to each one. When the plate became too\r\nheavy, the marshal emptied it into a large bag, borne behind us.\r\n\r\nI heard many compliments, and I was more looked at and admired than I\r\never had been before in my life. The prince royal said to me: 'If you\r\nhad asked each of us to give you his heart, no one could have refused\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nI replied: 'Affection is not solicited, it is inspired.'\r\n\r\nHe seemed pleased with my frankness. I cannot comprehend how a woman\r\ncould solicit love, and say: Love me, admire me.... For a king I could\r\nnot thus degrade myself. Tenderness is involuntary; one may seek to win\r\nit, one may gladly accept it when offered; but to solicit it, is even\r\nmore ridiculous than criminal.\r\n\r\nThe washing of the feet is one of the most striking ceremonies of our\r\nreligion. A king kneeling before those twelve aged men, and then\r\nstanding behind them while they are at table, is a most touching and\r\nsublime spectacle. That ceremony can never pass from my memory. Augustus\r\nIII, although no longer young, is still handsome; his gestures bear the\r\nimpress of dignity and nobility: the prince royal, Charles, resembles\r\nhim exactly.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday we visited the sepulchre; all the court ladies were\r\ndressed in black; we made our stations in seven churches, and in each we\r\nsaid appropriate prayers. I was on my knees during a whole hour in the\r\ncathedral. On Holy Saturday the services were magnificent, and the\r\norgans pealed forth the most heavenly strains of music.\r\n\r\nTho princess's Easter collation (swiencone) was superb; until yesterday,\r\nthe tables were continually covered with cakes and cold meats. It is\r\njust one year since I assisted at Madame Strumle's very modest\r\ncollation; I was then a schoolgirl; who could have guessed that on the\r\nfollowing Easter Monday I should be with the princess palatiness, that\r\nthe prince royal would partake of the same collation with myself, and\r\nthat we should eat out of the same plate!\r\n\r\nOne really finds a pleasure in eating meat after a Lent so rigorously\r\nobserved; for all here are as particular as at Maleszow. During holy\r\nweek, everything is cooked in oil, and on Good Friday a severe fast is\r\nadhered to, each one taking only food sufficient to keep him from\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\nThe prince royal has fasted so much that he has become quite thin. I\r\nnoticed this yesterday, and my eyes involuntarily rested upon his\r\nfeatures with a more tender expression than usual: as he was talking\r\nwith the prince palatine, I did not think he was paying any attention to\r\nme, but thoughts springing from the heart never escape him, he is so\r\ngood, so quick in understanding; soon after, he thanked me for my\r\nsolicitude. I grew very red, and promised myself in future to keep a\r\nstrict guard over the expression of my eyes.\r\n\r\nA woman's part, especially that of an unmarried girl, is very difficult;\r\nnot only must she measure out her words and watch the tones of her\r\nvoice, but she must also command the expression of her countenance. I\r\nmust ask, of what use are governesses and their lessons in such cases?\r\nThe princess is quite right when she says, that ten governesses, let\r\nthem be as watchful as they may, cannot guard a young girl who does not\r\nknow how to guard herself.\r\n\r\n                                         Wednesday, _April 15th._\r\n\r\nWe leave Warsaw to-morrow; I am going with the prince and princess to\r\ntheir estate at Opole. My father has written to the princess to say that\r\nI may remain with her so long as my presence may be agreeable to her. I\r\nhope she will never be dissatisfied with me; I endeavor to please her in\r\nevery possible way. She inspires me with infinite fear and respect; she\r\ncontrols me entirely, and I am always ready to yield to the lightest\r\nexpression of her will; when she smiles upon me, when she looks at me\r\nkindly, it seems to me as if heaven were opening before me. If I should\r\never reach an advanced age, I would like to inspire the same feelings\r\nwhich I experience toward her. The prince royal himself is afraid of the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nWould any one believe that I am glad to think that I shall not now go to\r\nMaleszow? I dread the home of my childhood; it seems to me as if I\r\nshould profane it were I to visit it with a heart so filled with unrest\r\nand disquietude!\r\n\r\nOught I to regret the past? Will a life of torment be the price of a\r\nsingle ray of happiness enlightening the highest pinnacle of human\r\nfelicity? If the wish which I dare not express should ever be\r\naccomplished, I will surely be equal to my position; but I will also\r\nknow how to bear the shipwreck of my dearest hopes.... Great God, how\r\ncan I write, how dare I confide to paper what I fear to confess to\r\nmyself! When I think of him, I tremble lest any one should divine my\r\nfeelings, and yet I write!... If my journal were to fall into any one's\r\nhands I should be deemed mad, or at least most foolishly presumptuous; I\r\nmust shut it up under four locks.\r\n\r\n                           CASTLE OF OPOLE, Friday, _April 24th._\r\n\r\nWe have been here nearly a week; the situation of the castle is very\r\nagreeable, but I am no longer gay, and nothing pleases me. The trees\r\nshould already be green, and they are still bare; it should be warm, and\r\nthe air freezes me. I desired to embroider, but the indispensable silks\r\nwere wanting; I tried the piano, but it was not in tune: it will be\r\nnecessary to send to Lublin for the organist. There is quite a large\r\nlibrary here, but I dare not ask the princess for the key. The prince\r\nhas several new works; he paid in my presence six gold ducats for ten\r\nlittle volumes of M. Voltaire's works: Voltaire is now the most\r\ncelebrated writer in France. The princess forbids my reading his books,\r\nand I am sure I am quite content. But what I cannot endure is, that I am\r\nnot permitted to read a romance lately come from Paris, entitled _La\r\nNouvelle Héloïse_. It is by a certain Rousseau, and has made a great\r\nsensation here. I picked up one volume, and read a few pages of the\r\npreface, but what did I see? Rousseau himself says: 'A mother will\r\nforbid her daughter to read it.' The princess is quite right, and I laid\r\nthe book aside with a flutter at my heart which still continues.\r\n\r\nThe physicians in Warsaw have ordered the princess to ride on horseback\r\nduring her sojourn in the country; they say this exercise will be\r\nexcellent for her health. She laughed at the prescription, and had not\r\nthe faintest intention of trying it; but the prince palatine will hear\r\nof no jesting where physicians are concerned.\r\n\r\nHe has bought a pretty mare, very gentle and well trained, as also a\r\nmost comfortable saddle; but the princess still refuses to mount the\r\nanimal. She was with great difficulty persuaded yesterday to mount a\r\ndonkey, and thus make the circuit of the garden. She will be obliged to\r\nrepeat this exercise every day. As for me, who have no fear of horses, I\r\nhad a most burning desire to try the mare; I spoke of it yesterday\r\nevening; but the princess chid me, and told me with quite a severe air,\r\nthat it was the most improper thing in the world for a young lady. I\r\nmust of course renounce my desire; but I do it with real regret, for I\r\nalready saw myself in fancy riding through the forests, going to the\r\nchase, climbing the steep mountain sides with _him_, and admiring his\r\nstrength and skill....\r\n\r\nThe castle has become more lively; several persons have come from the\r\ncity and the neighborhood to present their homage to the palatine. They\r\nmight perhaps afford me amusement; and yet I do not even find a passing\r\ndistraction in their presence. I have seen Michael Chronowski, my\r\nfather's former chamberlain; how the poor young man is changed! The\r\nprince palatine, in consequence of my father's recommendation, placed\r\nhim at the bar in Lublin. They say he is doing very well, but he is\r\nthin, bent, and old before his time; his face is strangely colored, and\r\nhe has some frightful scars. He has not danced once since Barbara's\r\nwedding. The time for mazourkas and cracoviennes is past: they have been\r\nreplaced by law cases, pleading, chicanery, and all its tiresome\r\naccompaniments; his language is so learned that one can no longer\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\nAs a compensation, however, we have here one very agreeable visitor,\r\nPrince Martin Lubomirski, the prince palatine's cousin, though much\r\nyounger than he. I had already met him in society at Warsaw. The\r\nprincess, who is severe, and who never overlooks the least defect,\r\ncriticizes him a little; but I find his manners very agreeable: he owns\r\nin the neighborhood the estate of Janowiec, and has given us all a most\r\npressing invitation to visit his castle. It is possible we may go there;\r\nI should be charmed, for no one talks more agreeably. He is gay, fond of\r\npleasantry, and a great friend to the prince royal; he often speaks of\r\nhim, and always well and worthily; he appreciates him and knows how to\r\npraise him.... My heart swells with pleasure while I listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CASTLE OF JANOWIEC, Friday, _May 1st, 1760._\r\n\r\nWe came here two days ago, and Prince Martin says he will not let us\r\nsoon depart. Everything is more beautiful at Janowiec than at Opole; no\r\none can be more generous, more hospitable, or more amiable than Prince\r\nMartin. The princess says he scatters gold and silver about as if he\r\nexpected it to grow. He is now having a wide avenue cut through the\r\nforest surrounding the castle. I can see from the windows of my room\r\nimmense trees falling beneath the axes of hundreds of laborers; at the\r\nend of the avenue, a pavilion is being built, at which they work so\r\nrapidly that one can see it grow from hour to hour. The prince sent to\r\nWarsaw and to various other places for his workmen; he pays them double\r\nwages, and he has made a bet with the palatine that the pavilion will be\r\nentirely finished in four weeks. I am quite sure he will win. The forest\r\nis to be transformed into an enclosed park. The whole neighborhood\r\nabounds in wild beasts; but he has had many elks and bears taken to\r\npeople his wonderful park. There must be some mystery lurking behind all\r\nthese preparations. I feel, rather than guess it.\r\n\r\nI like Janowiec better than any other place; the situation is charming,\r\nand the castle magnificent. It stands upon a mountain overlooking the\r\nVistula; its architecture belongs to a very ancient period. From the\r\ncastle the whole city may be seen, with the granaries of Kazimierz, and\r\nalso Pulawy, belonging to the Princess Czartoryski. The apartments are\r\nlarge, very numerous, and gorgeously furnished; but I believe that my\r\nboudoir is the most delightful room in the castle. It is situated at the\r\ntop of a tower, and while I am in it I can fancy myself a real heroine\r\nof romance. It has three windows, all opening in different directions,\r\nand each with a most enchanting view. I generally sit by the window\r\noverlooking the new avenue and the pavilion, which rises as if built by\r\nfairies. The panels of my cabinet are adorned with paintings,\r\nrepresenting Olympus. 'Venus alone was wanting,' said the prince, with\r\nthat grace for which he is distinguished, 'but you have come to finish\r\nthe picture.'\r\n\r\nI feel here an incomprehensible sense of well-being, I am soothed by\r\nsuch sweet presentiments, I fancy myself on the eve of some very happy\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                Sunday, _May 3d._\r\n\r\nI do not think I ever rose so early before in my whole life; the castle\r\nclock has just struck three, and I am already at my writing. I took a\r\nwalk before daylight through the long corridors of the castle: had any\r\none seen me, I should have been taken for an ancestral shade, come to\r\nvisit the domain of its descendants. Prince Martin, following an old and\r\nexcellent custom, has built a gallery, containing the portraits of all\r\nthe most distinguished members of his family; all the memories of the\r\nrace of Lubomirski may be found in this gallery. He sent to Italy for an\r\nartist to execute the portraits, and he called to his aid a learned man\r\nfully acquainted with the history of the Lubomirski family and of our\r\ncountry. After much deliberation and many discussions, the project was\r\nfinally carried into effect in 1756, as announced by the main\r\ninscription. It is to be regretted, says the princess, that these\r\npictures are in fresco, and not in oil colors, as they would then have\r\nbeen more solid and transportable.\r\n\r\nLet what will happen in the future, at present this gallery is truly\r\nmagnificent. Yesterday, Prince Martin, with the palatine and the\r\npalatiness, gave me a historical account of each picture; I immediately\r\ndetermined to transfer them to my journal. With this intention I rose\r\nbefore day and visited the gallery on tiptoe while all were still\r\nsleeping. I will write down all I have been told, and all I have seen.\r\n\r\nIn the four corners of the hall are the arms of the Lubomirski family,\r\nSrzeniawa, received on the occasion of a battle gained by one of the\r\nancestors on the banks of the Srzeniawa, not far from Cracow. The first\r\npicture represents the division of the property between the three\r\nbrothers Lubomirski; a division which was made according to law, during\r\nthe reign of Wladislas I, and signed February 1st, 1088. Nearly all the\r\nother pictures are family portraits; women rendered illustrious by noble\r\ndeeds, and men distinguished in political, civil, military, or religious\r\ncareers, especially during the reigns of Sigismund III, of John Casimir,\r\nand of John III, Sobieski, There are several copies of the portrait of\r\nBarbara Tarlo, who brought the castle of Janowiec as a dowry to a\r\nLubomirski.\r\n\r\nThe series is ended by a picture which is equivalent to a whole poem; it\r\nrepresents a winter sky and a naked forest; a furious bear endeavors to\r\noverthrow a tall and athletic man; a young woman, wearing a hunting\r\ncostume, comes behind the bear and places a pistol at each ear. In the\r\ndistance is a horse running away and dragging behind him an upset\r\nsledge. I asked an explanation of the picture, and was told as follows:\r\n\r\nA certain Princess Lubomirska, who was very fond of the chase, set out\r\none winter day on a bear hunt; as she was returning in a little sledge,\r\ndrawn by one horse, and having only one attendant with her, a furious\r\nbear, driven by some other hunters, fell upon the princess. The\r\nterrified horse upset the sledge, and she and the attendant must\r\ninfallibly have perished, had not the courageous servant determined to\r\nsacrifice himself for his mistress; he threw himself before the bear,\r\nsaying these words; 'Princess, remember my wife and children.' But the\r\nnoble and heroic woman, thinking only of the danger of him who was about\r\nto sacrifice his life for her, drew two small pistols from her pockets,\r\nplaced the barrels in the bear's ears, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\nIn truth, I envy this noble and generous action.... It is needless to\r\nadd that the servant with his wife and children became henceforth the\r\nspecial care of the princess.\r\n\r\nBut, during the last few moments, I have heard considerable noise\r\nthrough the castle, and I must return to my own room. I hear Prince\r\nMartin's voice resounding through the corridors. He is calling his dogs,\r\nof which he is exceedingly fond, as indeed he may well be, for his\r\nhounds are the most beautiful in the whole country. He is always sorry\r\nwhen the season will not admit of hunting; but at present the most\r\nintrepid hunters are forced to renounce their sport. I must close my\r\nbook. It is five o'clock, and some one might come into the gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Thursday, _May 14th._\r\n\r\nWe have been to Opole, where we spent several days; but Prince Martin\r\nmade us promise to return here, and here we are again installed. He\r\nwished us to see the pavilion entirely finished. The exterior is\r\ncompleted, and only a few interior embellishments are yet wanting.\r\nPrince Martin has then won his bet, and he talks to me about it in such\r\nstrange enigmas that I cannot comprehend him; for example, he said to me\r\nthis morning: 'Every one says that I am expending the most enormous sums\r\non my park and my pavilion; but I shall receive a recompense which I\r\nshall owe to you, far above anything I can do.'\r\n\r\nIndeed, I lose myself in conjecture; either I am mad, or all who come\r\nnear me have lost their senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Saturday, _May 16th._\r\n\r\nCould I ever have anticipated such happiness! The prince royal has\r\narrived; the pavilion, the park, and all, were for him, or rather for\r\nme; for they know that he loves me, and to please him, the princes have\r\ninvented this pretext for bringing him to Janowiec. Great Heaven! what\r\nwill my fate be! I bless the happy accident that brought him here at\r\nnightfall, for otherwise every one must have observed my blushes, my\r\nembarrassment, and that throbbing at my heart which deprived me of the\r\npower of speech and took away my breath; he too would have understood my\r\njoy! I never saw him so tender before; but the future--what will that\r\nbe?...\r\n\r\nUntil now, I have always feigned not to comprehend the meaning of his\r\nwords, and have striven to hide from him all that was passing in my\r\nsoul; but can I always control myself when I must see him every moment?\r\nAh! how painful will be the effort!... What torture ever to repress the\r\nbest feelings of one's soul! To refuse expression to my thoughts, when\r\nmy thoughts are all personified in him.... Notwithstanding my efforts, I\r\nfear lest my heart should be in my eyes, in my voice, in some word\r\napparently trivial.... God give me courage, for what can my future\r\ndestiny be? On what can I rely?... My fate sometimes appears to me so\r\nbrilliant, I foresee a superhuman happiness; and then again it seems to\r\nme so dark and menacing that a shudder runs through my whole frame.\r\n\r\nI do not know what to decide upon; I do not know whether I should trust\r\nto my heart or my reason. Alas! my reason--I have only fears and\r\nmelancholy foreshadowings, which lead me back to the truth when I have\r\nyielded too willingly to the enchantment of such sweet illusions.\r\n\r\nIf I could confide in any one; if I could find a friend and guide in the\r\nprincess! But my attachment to her is too respectful to be tender and\r\nconfiding; then she says, perhaps by chance, words which destroy my\r\ndesire to make a confidante of her. She blames the prince's character,\r\nand pities the woman who would bind herself to him.... The palatine\r\ngives me no assistance; he doubtless believes my virtue is strong enough\r\nto suffice without aid or counsel.\r\n\r\nI will accept all the happiness which Heaven may send me; I will guard\r\nit as a sacred treasure, but I will commit no imprudence, no action\r\nunworthy of my name. God will be my refuge; he will deign to enlighten\r\nme. I passed the whole of last night in prayer. Ah! how sorry I am the\r\nAbbé Baudoin is not here, for each day will be a new trial. The prince\r\nwill remain some time at the castle; the princes, his brothers, will\r\nsoon join him here, and great projects for hunting have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             _May 18th._ evening.\r\n\r\nHeaven has been gracious, and my destiny is the happiest of all! I,\r\nFrances Krasinska, in whose veins runs no royal blood, am to be the wife\r\nof the prince royal, Duchess of Courland, and one day, perhaps, may wear\r\na crown.... He loves me, loves me beyond everything; he sacrifices his\r\nfather to me, and overleaps the inequality in our rank; he forgets all,\r\nhe loves me!\r\n\r\nIt seems to me I must be misled by some deceitful dream! Is it indeed\r\ntrue that I went alone with him this afternoon to walk in the park? The\r\nprincess's recent accident was the cause. As she was ascending the\r\nstairs of the pavilion, she made a false step, and was forced to remain\r\nin the saloon with one of the young lady companions. Usually, she does\r\nnot leave us a single moment; but as her foot would not permit her to\r\nwalk, the princes, he and I, went without her. Prince Martin stopped by\r\nthe way to show the prince palatine some of his preparations for the\r\nchase. The prince royal told them he preferred to walk on, and passed my\r\narm within his own. He was silent during some moments; I was surprised,\r\nfor I had always seen him so abounding in wit, and so fertile in\r\nsubjects of conversation. He finally asked me if I still persisted in\r\nmisunderstanding the motive which had brought him to Janowiec. I\r\nreplied, as usual, that the anticipated pleasures of the chase had\r\ndoubtless determined him to accept Prince Martin's invitation.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, 'I came for you, for myself, to secure the happiness of\r\nmy whole life.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible?' I cried; 'Prince, do you forget your rank, and the\r\nthrone which awaits you in the future? The prince royal should wed a\r\nking's daughter!'\r\n\r\nHe replied: 'You, Frances, you are my queen; your charms first seduced\r\nmy eyes, and later, your truth and virtue subjugated my heart. Before I\r\nknew you, I had been always accustomed to receive advances from women;\r\nscarcely had I said a word, when I was overwhelmed with coquetries....\r\nYou, who have perhaps loved me more than they, you have avoided me; one\r\nmust divine your secret thoughts if one would love you without losing\r\nall hope; you merit the loftiest throne in the universe, and if I\r\ndesired to be King of Poland, it would only be that I might place a\r\ncrown upon your noble and beautiful brow.'\r\n\r\nMy surprise, my happiness, deprived me of all power to reply; meanwhile,\r\nthe princes rejoined us, and the prince royal said to them:\r\n\r\n'I here take you for the witnesses of my oath: I swear to wed no other\r\nbride than Frances Krasinska; circumstances require secrecy until a\r\ncertain period, and you alone will know my love and my happiness: he who\r\nbetrays me will be henceforth my enemy.'\r\n\r\nThe princes made the most profound salutations, and expressed themselves\r\ndeeply honored by the prince royal's confidence; they assured him that\r\nthey would keep his secret most religiously; then, passing by my side,\r\nthey whispered in my ear, 'You are worthy of your good fortune,' and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nI stood motionless and dumb, but the prince was so tender, his words\r\nwere so persuasive and so eloquent, that I ended by confessing to him\r\nthat I had long loved him: I believe one may, without criminality, make\r\nthis avowal to one's future husband.... The castle clock at length\r\nstruck midnight, that hour for ghosts and wandering spirits; after\r\nmidnight their power vanishes.... Can I yet be the plaything of an\r\nillusion?... But no, all is true, my happiness is real, my grandeur is\r\nno dream.... The ring I wear upon my finger attests its truth.\r\n\r\nBarbara gave me a ring in the form of a serpent, the symbol of eternity;\r\nthe prince royal often fixed his eyes upon it, and now he has had one\r\nmade exactly like it, with this inscription: 'Forever,' which he has\r\nexchanged with me for mine. Our first and holy betrothal had no\r\nwitnesses but the trees and the nightingales. I will tell no one of this\r\noccurrence, not even the princess.\r\n\r\nAlas! Barbara and my parents are also ignorant of it--they have not\r\nblessed our rings; it was not my father who promised me to my betrothed,\r\nnor has my mother given me her blessing!... Alas! my sorrow oppresses\r\nme, and my face is bathed in tears.... Yes, all is true, this must\r\nindeed be life, since I begin to suffer!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Monday, _May 25th._\r\n\r\nI have written, and it seems to me as if I had said nothing; I have not\r\nwritten during the past week, because I found no words to express my\r\nthoughts.... I am happy, and language, which is eloquent in the\r\nexpression of sorrow, has no tongue for joy and happiness.\r\n\r\nLast week, I took up my pen to write, but I soon gave up the attempt; my\r\nfeelings and ideas were confused with their own constant repetition and\r\nrenewal, and when my poor head would have presided over the arrangement\r\nof the words, my heart melted into hopes and desires.... I can write\r\nto-day, because the fear of misfortune, of some sudden catastrophe, has\r\nseized upon me.... If he should cease to love me!...\r\n\r\nThe royal princes, Clement and Albert, arrived last Thursday. There have\r\nbeen hunting parties without intermission. Prince Martin had sent for\r\nplenty of wild animals; they were let loose in the park, and the princes\r\nhave had as much as they could do. My maid tells me the princes Clement\r\nand Albert leave this morning; my first thought was that he would go\r\ntoo.... Happiness has entirely absorbed me during the past week;\r\nhappiness, unalloyed by a single fear; my cares too as mistress of the\r\nhouse (for since the princess's accident I have taken her place) have\r\nleft me not a moment unemployed!... And now, these few words uttered by\r\nmy maid have completely unsettled my mind: Great Heaven, if he were to\r\ngo too! For whom would I wake in the morning, for whom would I dress\r\nwith so much care, for whom would I strive to be more beautiful? Ah!\r\nwithout him, I can see but death and a void which nothing can fill!... I\r\ngrow faint.... I must open the window.... I breathe, and already feel\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIt is only six o'clock, and yet I see a white handkerchief floating from\r\nthe window of the pavilion. That is his daily signal, to say good\r\nmorning. I will never confess to him that my awakening each day preceded\r\nhis.... But who is that man running toward the castle; I know him\r\nwell--his favorite huntsman; he brings me a bouquet of fresh flowers;\r\nthey must have been sent for to an orangery four leagues from here....\r\nHow silly and unjust I was to torment myself so! He is still here, no\r\none has told me that he is going, he will doubtless remain a long\r\ntime.... Ah yes, some days of happiness will still be granted\r\nme--perhaps some weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLEEPING SOLDIER.\r\n\r\n  On the wild battle field where the bullets were flying,\r\n  With a ball in his breast a brave soldier was lying,\r\n  While the roar of the cannon and cannon replying,\r\n    And the roll of the musketry, shook earth and air.\r\n\r\n  The red ooze from his breast the green turf was a-staining;\r\n  The light of his life with the daylight was waning;\r\n  From his pain-parted lips came no word of complaining:\r\n    Where the fighting was hottest his spirit was there.\r\n\r\n  He had marched in the van where his leader commanded;\r\n  He had fall'n like a pine that the lightning has branded;\r\n  He was left by his mates like a ship that is stranded,\r\n    And far to the rear and a-dying he lay.\r\n\r\n  His comrades press on in a gleaming of glory,\r\n  But backward he sinks on his couch cold and gory;\r\n  They shall tell to their children hereafter the story,\r\n    His lips shall be silent forever and aye.\r\n\r\n  A smile lit his face, for the foe were retreating,\r\n  And the shouts of his comrades his lips were repeating,\r\n  And true to his country his chill heart was beating,\r\n    When over his senses a weariness crept.\r\n\r\n  The rifle's sharp crack, the artillery's thunder,\r\n  The whizzing of shell and their bursting asunder,\r\n  Heaven rending above and the earth rumbling under,\r\n    Nevermore might awake him, so soundly he slept.\r\n\r\n  He had rushed to the wars from the dream of his wooing,\r\n  For fame as for favor right gallantly suing,\r\n  Stem duty each softer emotion subduing,\r\n    In the camp, on the field--the dominion of Mars.\r\n\r\n  And there when the dark and the daylight were blended,\r\n  Still there when the glow of the sunset was ended,\r\n  He slept his last sleep, undisturbed, unattended,\r\n    Overwept by the night, overwatched by the stars.\r\n\r\n    BATON ROUGE, LA., _September 10th, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY MISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and looked out.\r\n\r\nNot that I had been exactly asleep, but dreamily ruminating over a\r\nseries of chaotic visions that had about as much reason and order as a\r\nmusical medley. I had been riding in the cars for the past six hours,\r\nand had now become so accustomed to the monotony that all idea of a\r\nchange seemed wildly absurd; in my half-awake state, I was feebly\r\nimpressed with the conviction that I was to ride in the cars for the\r\nremainder of my existence.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the conductor, with the dull little glowworms of lamps\r\nwhich he so quickly jerked into their proper places, made a sudden break\r\nin my train of thought; and, not having anything else to occupy me just\r\nthen, I became speedily beset with the idea that the luminary just above\r\nmy head was only awaiting a favorable opportunity to tumble down upon\r\nit. The thought became unpleasantly absorbing; and, not having\r\nsufficient energy to get up and change my seat, I looked out of the\r\nwindow again.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was, like most country views, of no particular beauty when\r\nseen in the ungenial light of a November evening: the sky rather leaden\r\nand discouraging; the earth, chilled by the sun's neglect, was growing\r\nshrivelled and ugly with all its might; and the trees were dreary\r\nskeletons, flying past the car window in a kind of mad dance, after the\r\nfashion of Alonzo and the false Imogen. I gave up the idea of making the\r\ncars my future residence, and considered that it was quite time to look\r\nabout me, and inquire, for present, practical purposes, what I was and\r\nwhere I was going.\r\n\r\nBut, at the very outset of this laudable occupation, a disagreeable fact\r\nthrust itself impudently in my face, and even shook its fist at me in\r\ninsolent defiance. There was no getting over it--I was undeniably a\r\n_woman_--and, what was worse, rather a womanly woman. I am aware, of\r\ncourse, that this depends. If you should ask that stately lily, radiant\r\nwith beauty, from the crown of the head to the sole of her foot,\r\nsurrounded by her kind, and cherished and admired as one of the choicest\r\ngems of the garden, whether she considered it an agreeable thing to be a\r\nflower, she would probably toss her head in scorn, as youthful beauties\r\ndo, at the very question. But ask the poor roadside blossom, trampled\r\non, switched off, and subjected to every trial that is visited on\r\nstrength and roughness, without the strength and roughness to protect\r\nher, and there is very little doubt that she would express a desire to\r\nwake up, some morning, and find herself transformed into a prickly pear.\r\nWomanhood, under some circumstances, is very much like sitting partly on\r\none chair, and partly on another, without being secure on either.\r\n\r\nIt is an unnatural combination to have the propensities of a Columbus or\r\nRobinson Crusoe united with a habit of trembling at stray dogs in the\r\ndaytime, and covering one's head with the bedclothes at night. I had\r\nlonged to be afloat for some time past; but now, that I was fairly out\r\nof sight of land, I shuddered at the immensity of the fathomless sea\r\nthat stretched before me. Whither bound? To the 'Peppersville Academy,'\r\nin a town on the border of a lake familiar to me in my geography days at\r\nschool, but which seemed, practically, to have no more connection with\r\nNew York than if it had been in Kamtchatka. To this temple of learning I\r\nwas going as assistant teacher; and the daring nature of the undertaking\r\nsuddenly flashed upon me. Suppose that, when weighed in the examining\r\nbalances, I should be found wanting? Suppose that some horridly sharp\r\nboy should 'stump' me with 'Davies' Arithmetic?'\r\n\r\nThat was my weak point, and I realized it acutely. Figures never would\r\narrange themselves in my brain in proper order; I am by no means sound\r\neven on the multiplication table; and the only dates that ever fixed\r\nthemselves in my memory are 1492 and 1776. The very sight of a slate and\r\npencil gave me a nervous headache, and as I had lately been told that\r\n_idiots_ always failed in calculation, I considered myself but a few\r\nremoves from idiocy. My answering that advertisement was a proof of it;\r\nand here I was, hundreds of miles from any familiar sight, going to\r\nteach pupils who probably knew more than I did! I had my music and\r\nFrench, to be sure, and that was _some_ foundation--but not half so\r\nsolid as a substantial base of figures.\r\n\r\nIn a sort of frantic desperation, I began, to ply myself with impossible\r\nsums in mental arithmetic, until I nearly got a brain fever; and the\r\ncars stopped, and the dreaded station was shouted in my ears, while I\r\nwas in the midst of a desperate encounter with a group of stubborn\r\nfractions.\r\n\r\nHow I dreaded the sight of the personage who had twice subscribed\r\nhimself my 'obedient servant, Elihu Summers'! My 'obedient servant,'\r\nindeed! More likely my inexorable taskmaster, with figures in his eye\r\nand compound fractions at his tongue's end. I painted his portrait:\r\ntall, wiry, with compressed lips, and a general air of seeing through\r\none at a glance. Now, when one is painfully conscious of being deficient\r\nin several important points, this sort of person is particularly\r\nexasperating; and I immediately began to hate Mr. Summers with all my\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I shook considerably, and, having been informed that I\r\nwould be met at the station, though by whom or what was not specified, I\r\nprepared to alight, with my bag and shawl and 'Harper,' attached to\r\nvarious parts of my person. Considering how short the step is from the\r\nsublime to the ridiculous, the length, or rather height, of that step\r\nfrom the car to the platform was out of all proportion; I looked upon it\r\nas an invention of the enemy, and stood hopelessly considering the\r\nimpossibility of a descent without the aid of a pair of wings.\r\n\r\nRaising my eyes in dismay, I saw in the dim light a pair of arms\r\noutstretched to my assistance; and, observing that the shoulders\r\npertaining thereto were broad and solid-looking, I deposited my hundred\r\nand twenty pounds of flesh and bone thereon without any compunctions of\r\nconscience, and no questions asked. I almost fell in love with that\r\nindividual for the very tender manner in which I was lifted to the\r\nground; but, once safe on terra firma, I merely said, 'Thank you, sir,'\r\nand was gliding rapidly into the ladies' saloon, half afraid of\r\nencountering Mr. Summers in my journey.\r\n\r\nBut my _aide-de-camp_, with a hasty stride, arrested my progress, as he\r\nsaid inquiringly, 'This is Miss Wade, I believe?'\r\n\r\nI turned and looked at him, as the light fell upon his figure from the\r\nopen doorway--large and well proportioned, with the kind of face that\r\none sees among the heroes of a college 'commencement,' or the successful\r\ncandidates for diplomas--half manly, half boyish, with a firm mouth and\r\nlaughing eyes; and he immediately added, 'I have come to conduct you to\r\nyour boarding house.'\r\n\r\nI concluded that he was either a son or nephew of 'Elihu Summers,'\r\npossibly an assistant in the school; and I felt glad at the prospect of\r\nsome congenial society.\r\n\r\nThe walk to the boarding house was not a long one, and we said very\r\nlittle on the way. My companion had quietly relieved me of my small\r\narticles of baggage; and I had mechanically taken the offered arm as\r\nthough I had known him all my life. I could not see much of the town in\r\nthe dark, and what I did see did not impress me with a very exalted idea\r\nof its liveliness--the inhabitants apparently considering it sinful to\r\nshow any lights in the fronts of their houses, except an occasional\r\nglimmering over the hall door.\r\n\r\nMy companion suddenly turned, mounted two steps, and lifted a knocker.\r\nThe sound, at first, produced no reply; but presently a sound of\r\nunbolting and unbarring ensued, and the door was opened, as Morgiana\r\nwould have opened it to let in the forty thieves. A small, pale man,\r\nwith whitish eyes, and gray hair standing on end, peered at us rather\r\ninhospitably; and on the lower step of the staircase a tallow candle, in\r\na brass candlestick, emitted the brilliant light that tallow candles\r\nusually do.\r\n\r\nWe effected an entrance by some miracle; and once in that full blaze of\r\nlight, the old man exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Mr. Summers, so it is you, is it? I was kind of puzzled to make out\r\n_who_ 'twas. And is this the new teacher you've brought along, or a\r\nboarding scholar? Looks about as much like one as t'other.'\r\n\r\nWith a smile, I was introduced as 'Miss Wade;' and just as a pleasant\r\nmatronly looking woman made her appearance, the old man seized me in an\r\nunexpected embrace, observing, quite as a matter of course, 'I always\r\nkiss nice-looking young gals.'\r\n\r\n'Not always,' thought I, giving him a desperate push that sent him,\r\nwhere he more properly belonged, to the arms of Mrs. Bull, who\r\nopportunely arrived in time to restore his equilibrium.\r\n\r\nI suppose my cheeks were blazing, they felt so hot, for the good wife\r\ngently remarked, 'It is only Mr. Bull's way--he doesn't mean anything by\r\nit, or I should have been jealous long ago.'\r\n\r\nHad the observation not been so hackneyed, I would have advised Mr. Bull\r\nto mend his way; but he seemed so thoroughly astonished that further\r\ncomment was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA glance at Mr. Summers, who had proved to be the redoubtable Elihu,\r\ndiscovered an amused smile hovering around the corners of his mouth; and\r\nit _was_ ridiculous that, at my first entrance into a house, I should\r\nhave a pitched battle with the master of it. To do the old man justice,\r\nI do not believe that he _did_ 'mean anything,' as the intended salute\r\nwas to be given in the presence of witnesses; he only labored under the\r\nhallucination of old men in general, who seem to think that, because it\r\nis an agreeable thing to them to kiss all the fresh young lips they\r\nencounter, it must be just as agreeable to the fresh young lips to\r\nreceive it; reminding me of a wise saying I encountered somewhere\r\nlately, that, 'although age sees a charm in youth, youth sees no charm\r\nin age.'\r\n\r\nBut father Bull was not malicious; he only said that 'he guessed I\r\nwasn't used to country ways;' and after that little brush we became very\r\ngood friends.\r\n\r\nI took to _Mrs._ Bull at once; and, following her into a neat little\r\nroom, where there was a stove, a rag carpet, and a table laid for one, I\r\nwas informed that this was the dining room, sitting room, and room in\r\nordinary. Tea was over long ago; indeed, as it was eight o'clock, they\r\nhad begun to think of going to bed. Cars in which I travel are always\r\nbehindhand; and they had almost given me up.\r\n\r\nHaving introduced me to my host and hostess, Mr. Summers took his leave,\r\nfor he did not board there, and went to see that my trunk was speedily\r\nforwarded to its destination.\r\n\r\nI sat down at the neat table, and tried what Mr. Bull denominated\r\n'presarved squinches'--which might have passed for fragments of granite,\r\nand were a trifle sour in addition; the apple pie, which, had it been\r\nlarge enough, would have been a splendid foundation for a quadrille; the\r\nbread, which looked like rye, but wasn't; and the tea, which neither\r\ncheered nor inebriated. This is what good, honest city people eulogize\r\nunder the name of 'a real country tea;' and half an hour after I had\r\nleft the festive board, I could not positively have sworn whether I had\r\nhad any tea or not.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bull were very hospitable, and pressed me continually to\r\neat, remarking that 'I had an awful small appetite;' but I considered it\r\nawful under the circumstances, without being small. They had one other\r\nboarder, they said, 'a single lady, who was very quiet, and didn't\r\ndisturb any one.' They evidently intended this as an eulogy for Miss\r\nFriggs, but I should have preferred an inmate with more life about her.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock I concluded, from various signs, that it was time to\r\nturn my steps bedward; and producing a fresh tallow candle, Mrs. Bull\r\nplaced it in another brass candlestick, and led the way up stairs. The\r\nstairs were narrow, crooked, and winding, and the doors opened with\r\nlatches. My sanctum was of moderate size, with a comfortable-looking\r\nbed, covered with a white counterpane (I had dreaded patchwork), a white\r\ncurtain to the window, and a white cover on the table,--a pleasant\r\nharmony, I thought, with the snow that would soon cover the ground; and\r\nfeeling chilled through, in spite of the fire that burned in the funny\r\nlittle stove, I wondered that so many people never think of providing\r\nfor but one kind of hunger.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bull helped me to arrange my things, and kissed me good-night in a\r\nway that went to my heart at once. I did not treat her on this occasion\r\nas I had treated Mr. Bull.\r\n\r\n'I suspect,' said she, kindly, 'that you've been used to things very\r\ndifferent from what you'll find here; but we'll do all in our power to\r\nmake it pleasant for you, and I dare say that, before long, you'll feel\r\nquite at home in Peppersville.'\r\n\r\nPeople 'dare say' anything, and many things appeared more probable than\r\nthat I should ever feel at home in Peppersville.\r\n\r\nOne thing I thoroughly congratulated myself upon, and that was that Mr.\r\nSummers boarded elsewhere. It is a dreadful thing to be housed under the\r\nsame roof, in a place where there is a total want of all excitement,\r\nwith any sort of a man--people have even become attached to spiders when\r\nshut up alone with them--and when the man is young, good-looking, and\r\npoor, the danger is increased. I did not come to Peppersville to fall in\r\nlove with the principal of the Academy; and I was glad that _one_ road,\r\nat least, to that undesirable end was cut off.\r\n\r\nI found the evening psalms and lessons, and then climbed into my\r\nnest--where I sank down, down, down into the feathery depths, in a\r\nmanner peculiarly terrifying to one whose nights had all been spent on\r\nhair mattresses. A few hours' ride had transplanted me into a new\r\nregion, among an entirely different race of people, and I fell asleep to\r\ndream that a whole army of intricate sums were charging upon me with\r\nfixed bayonets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMorning came, and I was under the painful necessity of getting up--which\r\nis always an unnatural wrench under the most favorable auspices. The\r\nfirst bell had rung at an unearthly hour, and I paid no attention to it,\r\nbut the second bell was not much more civilized; and as I failed to\r\nappear, Mrs. Bull came to the door to see if I had made way with myself.\r\n\r\nI told her not to wait--I would be down as soon as I could get dressed;\r\nand I plunged desperately into a basin of cold water. Thankful for the\r\ninstitution of nets, I hastily packed my hair into what Artemus Ward\r\ncalls 'a mosquito bar,' and with a final shake-out of my\r\nhurriedly-thrown-on drapery, I descended, with the expectation of\r\nfinding the family in the full enjoyment of their morning meal.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bull stood at the head of the table, Mr. Bull at the foot, and\r\nMiss Friggs at the side, all with their hands on their respective\r\nchairs. If they had stood in that position ever since Mrs. Bull's visit\r\nto my door, they had enjoyed it for at least half an hour.\r\n\r\nThis was very embarrassing; but the only answer that I received to my\r\nremonstrances was that 'they knew what manners was.' After that, I\r\nalways managed to be down in time.\r\n\r\nI found Miss Friggs just as she had been represented, with the addition\r\nof being very kindly disposed toward me; but between her and Mr. Bull\r\nthere existed a sort of chronic squabble that led to frequent passages\r\nof wit. Mr. Bull opened the ball, that morning, by observing, with a\r\nhalf wink at me, that 'he see she hadn't been kerried off yet,' which\r\nreferred to a previously expressed objection on the part of Miss Friggs\r\nto sleep without some secure fastening on the door of her room; and\r\npeople in the country can never understand why you should want anything\r\ndifferent from the existing state of things. Then Mr. Bull remarked that\r\nMiss Friggs had better sleep in a bandbox or an old stocking, as folks\r\npacked away valuables in such things, because they were seldom looked\r\ninto by housebreakers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Miss Friggs asked her tormentor if he had seen any robbers\r\nlately--when he turned around and handed me the butter. This referred to\r\na tradition that Mr. Bull had come running home one evening, entirely\r\nout of breath, under the firm belief that he was pursued by a robber,\r\nand nearly shut the door in Mr. Summers's face, who had been in vain\r\nhallooing to him to stop, in order to apprise him of my expected\r\narrival, and make some provision for my accommodation.\r\n\r\nThese things were all explained to me by degrees; and in the uneventful\r\nroutine upon which I had entered, I learned to consider them quite spicy\r\nand champagne-ish.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers called at fifteen minutes before nine, according to\r\nagreement, and we set out together for the Academy. It was a one-storied\r\nedifice, after a Grecian model, which probably looked well in marble,\r\nwith classical surroundings, but which, repeated in dingy wood, with no\r\nsurroundings at all, grated on an eye that studied the fitness of\r\nthings. But, unfortunately, my business was with the inside; and I felt\r\nuneasy when I saw the formidable rows of desks.\r\n\r\n'And now, Miss Wade,' said my companion, with admirable seriousness,\r\n'you see your field of action. You will have charge of about thirty\r\ngirls; and when they behave badly, so that you have any difficulty with\r\nthem, just send them in to me.'\r\n\r\nThis sounded as though they were in the habit of behaving very badly\r\nindeed; but I doubted if sending them in to him would have been much of\r\na punishment for any over fifteen.\r\n\r\nThere was one scholar there when I arrived--a tall, awkward-looking\r\ngirl, somewhat my senior--whom Mr. Summers introduced as 'Helen Legram.'\r\nHer only beauty was a pair of very clear eyes, that seemed to comprehend\r\nme at a glance; for the rest, her face was oddly shaped, her figure bad;\r\nand a narrow merino scarf, tied around her throat, was not a becoming\r\narticle of dress.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had I made these observations when the Philistines were\r\nupon me--arriving by twos, threes, and fours, and pouring through the\r\nopen door like overwhelming hordes of barbarians. Of course, every pair\r\nof eyes that entered was immediately fixed upon me; and, although I\r\nendeavored to keep up my dignity under the infliction, I could not help\r\nwishing that it were possible to be suddenly taken up and dropped into\r\nthe middle of next week, when my _mauvaise honte_ would have had a\r\nreasonable chance to wear off by several days' contact.\r\n\r\nThis _beginning_ is a terrible lion blocking up the way of every\r\nundertaking, and never does he appear so formidable as at the outset of\r\nschool teaching, unless it is in writing a story. I cast about in my\r\nmind for various models, as a sort of guide; but the only spirits that\r\nemerged from the vasty deep were Dr. Blimber and Cornelia. With an\r\ninconvenient perversity, they refused to be laid, and kept dancing\r\nbefore me all day. In entering upon my career, I was firmly impressed\r\nwith two convictions: one was that I didn't know anything, and the other\r\nwas that my pupils would speedily find it out.\r\n\r\nThe day began, as all sorts of days do; and through the open door of the\r\nadjoining apartment I watched Mr. Summers, and endeavored to follow all\r\nhis proceedings. When he rang his bell, I rang mine; and, by dint of\r\nlooking as wise and sober as I possibly could, I contrived to begin with\r\na tolerable degree of success.\r\n\r\nBut a pair of clear eyes, that never seemed to be removed from my face,\r\nembarrassed me beyond expression. Their owner was a perfect bugbear.\r\nSuch a formidable memory I never encountered; and in her recitations,\r\nwhich were long and frequent, I do not think she ever misplaced a\r\nletter. That girl had algebra written on her face; and when, in a slow,\r\ndeliberate way, she approached me with slate, pencil, and book, I felt\r\nsure that this would prove my Manassas. I was inexpressibly relieved to\r\ndiscover that the problems, complicated enough to bring on a slow fever,\r\nwere all unravelled; indeed, my feelings bore no small resemblance to\r\nthose of a criminal at the gallows just presented with a reprieve.\r\n\r\nAll that I had to do was to say, 'Very well, indeed, Miss Legram; are\r\nyou fond of algebra?' To which she replied, 'Very,' and went back to her\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nGoing in to Mr. Summers for some private instructions, I found his desk\r\ncovered with votive offerings, as though it had been the shrine of some\r\ndeity to be propitiated. There were large winter apples; hard winter\r\npears; bunches of chrysanthemum; bags of chestnuts, and even popped\r\ncorn; but the parcel that received the most honorable treatment was a\r\npaper of black-walnut kernels, carefully arranged and presented by a\r\nlittle, mild-eyed lame girl. I made a note of that.\r\n\r\nWith the dignity of a professor, Mr. Summers solved my difficulties;\r\nwhile I meekly listened, and wondered if this could be the half-boyish\r\nindividual who had lifted me from the cars. He did not look over\r\ntwenty-three, though, and, if not strictly handsome, had had a very\r\nnarrow escape of it. His hair had a way of getting into his eyes, and he\r\nhad a way of tossing it back as horses toss their manes; and this motion\r\ninvariably brings up a train of associations connected with Mr. Summers.\r\n\r\nThe day's session was over, and the pupils had departed. I thought that\r\nMr. Summers had departed also; and, nervous and wearied out with the\r\nunwonted strain upon my patience and equanimity, I applied myself\r\ndejectedly to the fascinating columns of 'Davies' Arithmetic,' for\r\nunless I speedily added to my small stock of knowledge, a mortifying\r\n_exposé_ would be the inevitable consequence. Why, thought I, with all\r\nthe ills that man is naturally heir to, must some restless genius invent\r\nfigures? The people in those examples have such an insane way of\r\ntransacting business, I could make nothing of them; my answers never\r\nagreed with the key, but I fully agreed with the poor man who said so\r\ndespairingly, 'Wat wi' faeth, and wat wi' the earth goin' round the sun,\r\nand wat wi' the railways all a whuzzin' and a buzzin', I'm clean\r\nmuddled, confoozled, and bet!' and flinging the book out of sight, I\r\ngave myself up to the luxury of a good cry.\r\n\r\nI had not been enjoying myself long, though, before I was interrupted;\r\nand as the crying was not intended for effect, the interruption was an\r\nunpleasant one. Of course, I had to answer that original question, 'What\r\nis the matter?' but instead of replying, after the most approved fashion\r\nin such cases, 'Nothing,' I went directly to the fountain head, and\r\nsaid, abruptly, 'Davies' Arithmetic.'\r\n\r\nMr. Summers quietly picked up the book, and I saw that he understood the\r\nmatter at once--for the dimples in his cheeks deepened perceptibly, and\r\nbeneath the dark mustache there was a gleam of white teeth. My face grew\r\nhot as I noted these signs, and I exclaimed desperately:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Summers, I should like, if you please, to resign my situation. I am\r\naware that I must seem to you like an impostor, for I cannot do anything\r\nat all with figures; and I thought'--\r\n\r\nHere I broke down, and cried again, and Mr. Summers finished the\r\nsentence by saying:\r\n\r\n'You thought that you would not be called upon to teach arithmetic? A\r\nvery natural conclusion, and there is no reason why you should. I prefer\r\ntaking charge of these classes myself--but no one can supply your place\r\nin French and music.'\r\n\r\n'A sugar plum for the baby,' thought I, and kept silence.\r\n\r\n'I think, though,' continued my mentor, 'that anything as dry and\r\npractical as figures is a very good exercise for an imaginative turn of\r\nmind, by supplying a sort of balancing principle; and, if you would like\r\nto improve yourself in this branch, I should take great pleasure in\r\nassisting you.'\r\n\r\nVery kindly done, certainly, and I accepted the offer with eagerness. I\r\nwas to rest that evening, he said--I had had enough for one day; but it\r\nwas understood that on other evenings generally he was to come to Mr.\r\nBull's and instruct his assistant teacher in the A B C of mathematics. I\r\ncould not help thinking that few employers would have taken this\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Bull appeared to be of no earthly use in the household except to go\r\nto the door, which, in Peppersville, was not an onerous duty; and had I\r\nnot so frequently seen the same thing, I should have wondered what Mrs.\r\nBull ever married him for. From frequent references to the time 'when\r\nMr. Bull was in the store,' I came to the conclusion that he had once\r\ndealt in the heterogeneous collection of articles usually found in such\r\nplaces. I was not informed whether Mr. Bull had 'given up the store,' or\r\nwhether 'the store' had given up Mr. Bull; but I was disposed to\r\nentertain the latter idea.\r\n\r\nThere was no servant in the establishment except an old Indian woman,\r\nwho amused herself by preparing vegetables and washing dishes in the\r\nkitchen--not being at all active, in consequence of having lost part of\r\nher feet from indulging in a fancy for a couch of snow on one of the\r\ncoldest nights of the preceding winter, when, to use a charitable\r\nphrase, 'she was not quite herself.' I believe that, even after this\r\nmelancholy warning, that eccentric person was frequently somebody else.\r\n'However,' as Mrs. Bull said, 'she didn't disturb any one'--and although\r\nI could not exactly see the force of this reasoning, I treated it with\r\nrespectful silence for Mrs. Bull's sake.\r\n\r\nMiss Friggs, who was 'quite one of the family,' and had lived in it so\r\nlong that I believe she almost persuaded herself that she had been born\r\nin it, 'did' her own room--which was perfectly appalling with its\r\nfearful neatness. There was not a thread on the carpet, nor a particle\r\nof dust in the corners; and the bed, when made up, was as accurately\r\nproportioned as though it had all been scientifically measured off. I\r\nhave caught glimpses of Miss Friggs going about this business with her\r\nhead carefully tied up, as though it might burst with the immensity of\r\nher ideas on the subject; and when she had finished, you might have\r\neaten off the floor--that is, if you preferred it to a table. This was\r\nher one occupation in life, and she did it thoroughly; but it seemed\r\ntoo sad to have so few occupations that any could be accomplished in so\r\nfaultless a manner.\r\n\r\nFired with honest but misguided zeal, I one morning entered the lists\r\nagainst Miss Friggs in a vain attempt to make my own bed; but those\r\nhorrid feathers acted like the things in the Philosopher's Scales, for\r\nwhen some were up, others were down; neither north nor south, east nor\r\nwest would agree to terms of equality, and it was impossible to bring\r\nthem to any sort of compromise.\r\n\r\nI related my experience to Mrs. Bull; and when I assured her that I had\r\ncrawled all over the bed in the vain attempt to bring some order out of\r\nchaos, she was more amused, in her quiet way, than I had ever known her\r\nto be. She desired me, however, to leave the room, to her in future, as\r\nshe enjoyed it, and I could not be expected to do everything. I did not\r\ninterfere with her measures again.\r\n\r\nA lesson had been given me to look over; and on Mr. Summers's first\r\nvisit to me, in Mrs. Bull's parlor, I felt as if he had been a dentist\r\nwith evil designs on my largest grinder. He was as cool as though he had\r\nbeen fifty and I five, and behaved himself generally as though it were a\r\nvery common thing for youthful principals to give private lessons to\r\ntheir young lady-teachers.\r\n\r\nMr. Bull had made a fire, which was another talent that I discovered in\r\nhim; and Mrs. Bull had given the room as much of a look of comfort as a\r\nroom can have that is very seldom used. The good woman had even placed a\r\ndish of apples and doughnuts on a table in the corner--which, she said,\r\nwere always on hand when Mr. Bull was paying his addresses to her; but\r\nthe family did not appear to put any such construction on Mr. Summer's\r\nvisits to me. I had told them that we had a great deal of school\r\nbusiness in common; and they seemed to think it quite natural that we\r\nshould have.\r\n\r\nAnd to business Mr. Summers proceeded immediately on his arrival,\r\nthrowing me into a state of complete confusion by asking me questions\r\nnot definitely set down in the book, and calmly allowing me to blunder\r\nthrough to something like an end without the least interruption or\r\nassistance. I, whose childhood had for some time been made miserable by\r\nthe question of a sharp schoolmate, 'Which is the heaviest--a pound of\r\nlead or a pound of feathers?' and her calm persistence that they were\r\nboth alike, in spite of my passionate denial in favor of lead, was not\r\nlikely to distinguish myself at these sittings; and whatever I had\r\nhitherto admired in Mr. Summers was now eclipsed by my appreciation of\r\nhis extraordinary patience.\r\n\r\n'You must think me a perfect fool!' I exclaimed, unguardedly.\r\n\r\n'No,' replied my imperturbable companion, 'I consider you a very fair\r\naverage.'\r\n\r\nI bit my lip in anger at myself, and turned assiduously to my slate and\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n'You will take that for next time,' said my preceptor, rising at the end\r\nof an hour, and calling my attention to a portion that he had marked in\r\npencil, 'when I shall be more particular about your recitations. Good\r\nevening.'\r\n\r\n'Very romantic,' thought I, as I walked rather discontentedly into the\r\nsitting room, and I wondered what sort of stuff Mr. Summers was made of.\r\nI began to be afraid that I might be piqued into flirting with him.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have the talent, though, of winning golden opinions from\r\nall sorts of people. Mr. Bull pronounced him 'a cute chap,' and 'real\r\nclever, too,' for he did not consider the terms synonymous. Mrs. Bull\r\nsaid that he was just the right person in the right place; and Miss\r\nFriggs declared that he was 'a young man among a thousand.' Not at\r\nPeppersville, certainly, for there were but five others in the place;\r\nbut, to use the phraseology most in vogue there, they could not hold a\r\ncandle to him.\r\n\r\nThat quiet, overgrown girl, with her faultless recitations and steady\r\npursuance of one idea, interested me exceedingly, and I determined to\r\nfind out her history. I spoke of her to Mr. Summers, and he replied:\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes; Helen Legram is quite an original. 'Born of poor, but\r\nrespectable parents,' I have little doubt that she will turn out like\r\nthe heroes of all biographies that commence in a similar manner. Her\r\nfather is a very plain farmer, living somewhere among the mountains,\r\nwith a large family to provide for; and Helen, in consequence, has\r\nhitherto enjoyed no advantages in the way of education beyond those\r\nobtained from an occasional quarter at the district school. In the\r\nintervals she had to wash, bake, mend, and make, with untiring industry,\r\nwith short snatches of reading, her only indulgence; until, last summer,\r\na relative, well to do in the world, spent some months at the mountain\r\nfarm, and presented Helen with the means of obtaining her heart's\r\ndesire--a thorough education. To that end she is now assiduously\r\ndevoting herself in the spirit of Milton, who 'cared not how late he\r\ncame into life, only that he came fit.' Helen Legram is a plain,\r\nunformed country girl; but she has those three handmaids of talent who\r\nso frequently eclipse their mistress: industry, patience, and\r\nperseverance; and I prophesy that not only will she succeed in her\r\npresent undertaking, but win for herself a name among the Hannah Mores\r\nand Corinnes of posterity. What a wife such a woman would make!'\r\n\r\nI wondered if he was engaged to her? They were about the same age, and\r\nbeing entirely opposite in every respect, it was quite natural that they\r\nshould fall in love with each other.\r\n\r\nI had some trouble with my tall pupil in French, as she had not quite\r\nthe Parisian accent, and at her time of life it was not easy to acquire\r\nit. She persevered, though, with unparalleled firmness; and as she\r\nwished to study Latin, I was obliged to learn it myself, from Mr.\r\nSummers. I pitied that man when I began to stumble through the\r\ndeclensions. Virgil would have torn his hair in frenzy at such rendering\r\nof his lines, and I should have been very sorry to encounter him alone.\r\nThere we sat, hour after hour, in Mrs. Bull's parlor, scarcely a word\r\npassing between us except on the subject of Latin or arithmetic. Mr.\r\nSummers was an excellent teacher; and it was worth my sojourn in\r\nPeppersville to learn what I did.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, we were rather more sociable; and in answer to\r\nsome remark of mine, Mr. Summers asked me where I supposed he was born!\r\n\r\nBeginning with Maine, I went regularly through the Eastern States, with\r\na strong desire to leave him in Massachusetts; but, very much to my\r\nsurprise, he denied them all.\r\n\r\n'New York, then, or New Jersey,' I persisted.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers only smiled; and then I tried the Hoosier States, where they\r\nare 'half horse and half alligator;' his figure was somewhat in the\r\nbackwoodsman style. But none of these would do.\r\n\r\n'Then,' said I, out of all patience, 'you could not have been born\r\nanywhere. I give it up.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' was the reply, 'I think you might as well, for you would never\r\nguess.'\r\n\r\nAnd here the matter ended. But frequently afterward did I find myself\r\nwondering what portion of the globe Mr. Summers could claim as his own,\r\nhis native land; for I had come to the conclusion that he might not be\r\nan American at all.\r\n\r\nSkating season arrived; and all Peppersville took to the lake like a\r\ncolony of ducks. It was splendidly exhilarating, and my crotchet needle\r\nhad for some time previous been flying through tangled mazes of crimson\r\nworsted, to the great admiration of the household, in the manufacture of\r\na skating cap.\r\n\r\nI must have been built expressly for going on ice, for it seemed like my\r\nnative element. Those beautiful moonlight nights, with the cold blue sky\r\nabove and the glittering crystal beneath, were like glimpses of\r\nfairyland. Mr. Summers taught me how to skate, for which I was\r\nsufficiently grateful; but I had no idea of being handed over to him\r\nexclusively for the benefit of Peppersville, so I seized upon 'big\r\nboys,' or staid, married men, or anything that came handy in the way of\r\nsupport, until I was sufficiently experienced to go alone.\r\n\r\nHelen Legram did not skate. Nothing could induce her to venture; and\r\nprobably, while we were cultivating our heels on the ice, she was\r\ncultivating her head in milder latitudes. I thought, _then_, that she\r\nwas to be pitied; but, two weeks later, I would have given all that I\r\npossessed to have followed her example in the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt was intensely cold that night, and somehow my skates were very\r\ntroublesome. Mr. Summers bent down to arrange them, and I declined\r\nmaking use of his shoulder as a support. I never knew how I did it, but\r\nice is slippery; I performed an extraordinary slide--kicked Mr. Summers\r\ndirectly in the mouth, thereby knocking out one of his front teeth, as\r\nthough I had been a vicious horse--and went backward into the arms of\r\nthe oldest male pupil of the Peppersville Academy, while my unfortunate\r\nvictim, knocked into a state of insensibility, fell prostrate on the\r\nice.\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered, of course, and raised their venerable preceptor, and\r\nbrought him to his senses, while I was congratulated on my escape. I\r\nlooked upon this as the most awkward predicament I had ever been placed\r\nin, and was completely nonplussed as to the course of action to be\r\npursued under the circumstances. Had I been in love with Mr. Summers, or\r\nhe with me, the case would have been different; as it was, I would have\r\ngiven much to have changed places with him. He declared, however, that\r\nit was nothing, laughed about the accident, and said that one tooth more\r\nor less made very little difference. Had he been a woman, he never would\r\nhave forgiven me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Mr. Summers was not at school, and Helen Legram took\r\nhis place. They boarded in the same house; and from her I learned that\r\nhis mouth was so much swollen he could scarcely speak. It was very\r\ndisagreeable, certainly; but, having weighed the matter all the morning,\r\nI came to the conclusion by afternoon, that it was decidedly my duty to\r\ngo and see after Mr. Summers.\r\n\r\nI found him in the parlor, considerably disfigured; and Helen Legram was\r\nmaking him some pap--that being the only style of sustenance upon which\r\nhe could venture. His mouth was very sore, for the sharp runner of a\r\nskate is rather a formidable weapon; but he laughed with his eyes when I\r\npresented myself, and seemed to enjoy my embarrassment.\r\n\r\n'I do not see how it happened,' said I, very much annoyed.\r\n\r\n'All that I know of the case,' replied Mr. Summers, quite as though it\r\nhad been somebody else's case, 'is that, while engaged in the discharge\r\nof my duty, a cloud of dimity suddenly floated before my eyes--a\r\nstunning shock ensued--I saw stars--and then exit into the region of\r\nknow-nothingdom.'\r\n\r\nRather awkwardly, I suppose, I offered myself as head nurse, having been\r\nthe cause of the mischief; but Mr. Summers, with many thanks for the\r\noffer, did not think there would be any necessity for availing himself\r\nof it. I felt very sorry for him, and quite as sorry for myself.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the principal returned to his school duties. He possessed\r\na remarkable degree of reticence; and, owing to this blessed quality,\r\nno one but ourselves and Helen Legram ever knew of my share in that\r\nunfortunate accident. I felt rather guilty whenever allusion was made to\r\nit by some well-meaning person; but I noticed that Mr. Summers always\r\nturned the conversation as soon as possible. We were on more social\r\nterms after that disaster; and somehow the evenings spent over Latin and\r\narithmetic became less practical, and decidedly more interesting. Mr.\r\nSummers, however, was very cautious, and so was I. He never seemed to be\r\nswayed by impulse; and I should have nipped anything like tenderness in\r\nthe bud.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, I was considerably astonished at him, and not a\r\nlittle indignant. The 'faculty' of the Peppersville Academy were invited\r\nto a small party at the house of one of its wealthiest patrons, who\r\nlived some miles out of town.\r\n\r\nThey sent a covered wagon for us, and a 'boy,' that indispensable\r\narticle in the country, to drive us.\r\n\r\nThe boy seemed to drive with his eyes shut; suddenly, there was a\r\nterrific jolt, and I screamed and clung to Mr. Summers for protection.\r\nUnder the circumstances this was unavoidable; but, as he seemed disposed\r\nto retain my hand, I tried to disengage it.\r\n\r\nIt was held in a firm grasp; and I said, in a tone that could not be\r\nmistaken: 'Mr. Summers!'\r\n\r\nMy hand was immediately released; and neither of us spoke another word\r\nduring the drive.\r\n\r\nI did not enjoy that party. I was angry at Mr. Summers, and I let him\r\nsee it; but I had no patience with any other man in the room. In driving\r\nback, Mr. Summers 'thought that he would sit outside, to get a little\r\nfresh air,'--which, as the thermometer stood at twenty, must have been\r\nexhilarating. I was handed out in silence, and went to bed in as bad a\r\nhumor as that in which many a belle comes from the ball room.\r\n\r\nThere was a coolness between us for several days, which gradually thawed\r\ninto a more genial state of things, but it did not seem to me that it\r\never became quite as it was before.\r\n\r\nAll winter there were rumblings deep and continual in the political\r\nsky--sometimes the sun broke out, and people said that it was going to\r\nclear; but usually the weathercocks predicted a long, southerly storm. I\r\nnever saw a man so full of prophecy as Mr. Bull. One would have supposed\r\nthat every hour brought him telegraphic despatches both from the real\r\nand the spurious Congress; and that President Lincoln and Jeff. Davis\r\nwere both convinced of their utter inability to take any steps without\r\nthe cognizance and approval of Mr. Bull.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bull said mildly that 'she hoped it would blow over;' but Mr. Bull\r\nexclaimed indignantly that 'he didn't want it to blow over--he wanted it\r\nto blow out and done with it, if it was goin' to, and not keep a\r\nthreatenin' all to no purpose. It was high time that things was settled,\r\nand people knew what was what. If we was goin' to hev a rumpus, he hoped\r\nwe'd _hev_ it.'\r\n\r\nIf the old man had not been really good-natured and inoffensive, I\r\nshould have taken him in hand; but these disconnected remarks appeared\r\nto give him so much pleasure that it would have been cruel to deprive\r\nhim of it.\r\n\r\nHelen Legram had a reverential way of speaking of Mr. Summers that\r\nprovoked me; but she told me one day, when I laughed at this, that no\r\none who knew his life could do otherwise. And how did _she_ 'know his\r\nlife'? He had never disclosed it to _me_--and I could not see what there\r\nwas in Helen Legram to entitle her to this confidence. They certainly\r\nwere engaged--everything went to prove it; and, if I had been at all in\r\nlove with Mr. Summers, I should have classed the feeling that pervaded\r\nme under the head of jealousy.\r\n\r\nMr. Bull 'guessed that Mr. Summers and that tall gal were goin' to make\r\na match of it;' and, when I assented to the proposition, he added that\r\n'she didn't _pretty_ much, but he kalkilated she'd make a good, stirrin'\r\nwife for a young man who had his livin' to get. Should hev kind o'\r\nthought,' continued Mr. Bull, who seemed to love the subject, 'that he'd\r\nhev fancied _you_; but there's no accountin' for tastes.'\r\n\r\nI glided out of the room unperceived, and the old gentleman probably\r\ntalked confidentially to the four walls for some time afterward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSumter had fallen; and the whole school broke out in badges.\r\nPeppersville was on fire, and burning, of course, in red, white, and\r\nblue flames. No one bought a dress even that had not the loyal colors\r\ndisplayed _somewhere_ in it; and a man who did not wear a cockade was\r\nrather looked askance upon.\r\n\r\nMr. Bull was in his element, and spent his time principally in going to\r\nthe post office in search of news, and asking everybody's political\r\nshibboleth. The subject was discussed at every meal. Mr. Bull thought\r\nthat half the members of Congress ought to have been hung long ago. Miss\r\nFriggs, who sometimes attempted the poetical, said that it made her\r\nheart bleed to think of the glorious figure of Liberty wandering\r\ndesolate and forsaken, with her costly robe of stars and stripes\r\ntrailing in the dust; and Mrs. Bull, who was one of the wisest women I\r\never knew, prudently said nothing on a subject which she did not quite\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe militia of Peppersville began to turn out in rusty regimentals, and\r\ncut up queer antics in the street; and Mr. Summers, who appeared to have\r\na talent for everything, took them in hand to drill.\r\n\r\n'Do you understand military tactics?' I inquired in surprise.\r\n\r\n'Somewhat,' was the reply. He had been captain of a company of boy\r\nsoldiers; and, now that I came to think of it, there was something\r\ndecidedly military in his bearing.\r\n\r\n'If I were only a _man!_' I exclaimed, discontentedly, 'I would be off\r\nto the war and distinguish myself; but a woman is good for nothing but\r\nto be insignificant.'\r\n\r\n'The works of a watch are 'insignificant,' in one sense,' observed my\r\ncompanion; 'but what would the watch he without them?'\r\n\r\n'I do not see any application in this case,' I replied, indifferently.\r\n\r\n'A woman,' said he, bending down to adjust some papers, 'is often the\r\nMiriam and Aaron of some Moses whose hands need holding up. Many a\r\nbullet that finds the heart of an enemy is sent, not by the hand that\r\npulls the trigger, but by a softer hand miles away. Something, or rather\r\nsome _one_, to work for, is an incentive to great deeds.'\r\n\r\nMr. Summers's face was flushed; and he looked suddenly up when he had\r\ndone speaking.\r\n\r\nI withdrew my eyes in confusion, and, with the careless remark, 'Mrs.\r\nPartington would tell you that you were speaking paregorically,' I left\r\na place that was getting entirely too hot to hold me.\r\n\r\nA few days after, Mr. Summers started for the seat of war, with the\r\ncommission of first lieutenant, and Helen Legram became principal of the\r\nPeppersville Academy. I think that bright spring days are disagreeable,\r\nglaring things, when some one whom you like and have been accustomed to\r\nsee in certain places, is seen there no more; and the day that Mr.\r\nSummers left, I was out of all patience with the April sunshine.\r\n\r\nHe had said no more: a friendly pressure of the hand from him, and a\r\nsincerely expressed hope on my part that he would return unharmed--a\r\nrequest from Mr. Bull to 'give it to 'em well'--a caution from Mrs. Bull\r\nnot to expose himself, if he could help it, to the night air--a\r\npincushion from Miss Friggs, because men never have conveniences-and he\r\nwas gone, with, no reasonable prospect of his return.\r\n\r\nI said this to myself a great many times; but I also said that I did not\r\ngo to Peppersville to fall in love with the principal of the Academy.\r\n\r\nThose everlasting recitations began to be unendurable; the walks about\r\nPeppersville were totally uninteresting, and I did not know what to do\r\nwith myself. I cultivated Helen Legram; and, during the vacation, she\r\ntook me home with her to the farm.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a new life, that three weeks' visit, and I enjoyed it\r\nextremely. We went on expeditions up the mountains, and lived a sort of\r\nvagrant life that was just what we both needed. The roar of cannon could\r\nnot reach us there; the sight of bleeding, dying men was far away; and\r\nwe almost forgot that the teeth of the children whom she had nourished\r\nat her breast were tugging at the vitals of the Union.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, amid the fragrant odor of pine trees, Helen Legram told\r\nme the story of Mr. Summers's life.\r\n\r\nHe was born and educated in Florida, much to my astonishment, and had\r\nentailed upon him the misery of a worthless, dissipated father. His\r\nmother, after dragging out a saddened existence, sank into the grave\r\nwhen her youngest boy was just entering upon the years of boyhood.\r\nFinally, the elder Summers, who had always boasted of his patrician\r\nblood, killed a man in a fit of mingled passion and intemperance, and\r\nthen cheated the gallows of its due by putting an end to his own life.\r\nHis property was quite exhausted; and the two sons who survived him\r\ncould only look upon his death as a release from continued mortification\r\nand disgrace. An uncle's house was open to receive them; but, before\r\nmany years had elapsed, Arthur Summers, who was described as a miracle\r\nof manly beauty, changed his name for that of a rich heiress who\r\nbestowed herself and her lands upon him, and requested his brother to\r\nfollow his example in the matter of the name at once, and in the matter\r\nof the heiress as soon as convenient.\r\n\r\nElihu Summers, however, persisted in retaining the name that his father\r\nhad disgraced; he said that he would redeem it, and declared that no\r\nwife of his should furnish him with bread while his brain and hands were\r\nin working order. His brother looked upon him as a harmless lunatic; but\r\nElihu was firm, and took up his abode at the North, as better calculated\r\nto further his design. After a series of adventures he became principal\r\nof the Peppersville Academy, with the view of ultimately studying a\r\nprofession; and there he had been for two years when I came in contact\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nI had been studying Helen Legram's face during this recital; and at its\r\nconclusion I asked her if she was engaged to Mr. Summers.\r\n\r\n'No, I am not engaged to him,' she replied, with a vivid blush; 'I have\r\ngood reason to suppose that he is attached to some one else.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' thought I, as I noted the blush, 'if not engaged to him, you are\r\ncertainly in love with him;' and I felt sorry for her if it was not\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nI did not go back to Peppersville that summer--I had had enough of\r\nschool teaching; and I returned to the relatives with whom I had become\r\ndisgusted, on promises of better behavior from them for the future. They\r\nwere not _near_ relatives--I had none; and I had rebelled at being\r\ntutored and watched like a child. Having fully asserted my independence,\r\nI was treated with more respect; but, while they supposed that I was\r\nnestling down in quiet content, I was busily casting about in my mind\r\nthe practicability of another venture.\r\n\r\nI burned to do something for my country; I could not do as meek women\r\ndid, and sit down and sew for it; the monotonous motion of the needle,\r\nwhich some people call so soothing, fairly distracted me; and, in spite\r\nof the low diet of Latin and mathematics on which I had been kept all\r\nwinter, I entertained vague visions of myself, in cropped hair and army\r\nblue, following the drum.\r\n\r\nJust at this critical juncture, when common sense was spreading her\r\npinions for flight, I received a letter from a darling Mentor of a\r\nfriend, who was spending the golden sunshine of her life as her Saviour\r\nspent His, in doing good; and she ordered me to the hospitals.\r\n\r\n'You have youth and health,' she wrote; 'spend them in the service of\r\nyour country. Many a brave soldier lies stiffening in his gore on the\r\nbloody field of Manassas; many as brave are writhing in agony in the\r\nhospitals that received the wounded of that disastrous day; go among\r\nthem with words of comfort, and smooth the pillow of those brave\r\ndefenders whose blood has been freely poured out to enable _you_ to\r\nsleep in peace.'\r\n\r\nI could wait no longer; in spite of protestation, I put my chattels in\r\norder, and was off with a noble band of women, who were all bent on the\r\nsame errand.\r\n\r\nI had heard nothing from Mr. Summers since his departure: he might have\r\nbeen killed at Manassas, or have fallen, side by side with the noble\r\nWinthrop, at Big Bethel, or have perished, as the lamented Ellsworth\r\nperished, by the hand of the assassin. I never expected to behold him\r\nagain in _this_ world; and I began to think that I had not appreciated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot describe my life as hospital nurse: it was just passing from\r\none scene of suffering to another; and I had not realized that there\r\n_could_ be so much misery in this bright, beautiful world. At first I\r\nused to tremble and faint; but finally the intense desire to _do_\r\nsomething for these poor, mutilated wrecks of humanity conquered the\r\nweakness; and I even wondered at my own self-control.\r\n\r\nThere were pleasant gleams, too, in this life, of utter\r\nself-abandonment; blessings from fever-parched lips; grateful looks from\r\ndying eyes; pleased attention to holy words; and, wrapping all like a\r\nhalo, the thought that I was working in very deed, ay, and battling,\r\ntoo, for the glorious flag that floated over my head.\r\n\r\nThey were constantly bringing in fresh patients, and the sight roused no\r\ncuriosity; but one day, such a ghastly face was upturned to view, as\r\nthey placed the shattered body tenderly on a cot, that, involuntarily, I\r\nbent closer.\r\n\r\n'Awful things, those Minié wounds,' observed a young surgeon who stood\r\nnear me; and then, as he went on to describe how the horrible ball\r\nrevolves in the lacerated flesh, I suddenly caught a full view of the\r\nfeatures, over which the shadow of death seemed to have settled, and\r\nfainted dead away.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time, I believe, before I regained my senses; but as soon\r\nas I did, I went to work. Mr. Summers was stretched before me on that\r\ncot, with a gaping wound in his shoulder, that had not been attended to\r\nin proper time. He opened his eyes once, and smiled, as he seemed to\r\nrecognize me bending over him; but a fainting fit ensued, and then he\r\nbecame delirious.\r\n\r\nI could not bear to have any one else attend to him, and I watched him\r\nfaithfully day and night. That dreadful Minié wound seemed as if it\r\nnever would heal, and I think that the doctors scarcely expected him to\r\nget up again. I almost felt as if I had been brought to the hospital for\r\nthis one purpose; and without his ever having told me in plain words\r\nthat he loved me--in spite of all my wise resolutions to the\r\ncontrary--during silent watches beside that couch of suffering, I became\r\nconvinced that I loved him with all the strength of which I was capable.\r\nYes, I who had nominally devoted myself to the service of my country,\r\nhad ignominiously closed my career by falling in love with the first\r\ngood-looking patient that had been brought into my ward!\r\n\r\nIf any stupid man, though (a woman would know better), supposes that I\r\ninformed Mr. Summers of this, either by word or look, in his first lucid\r\nmoment, he is entirely mistaken. On the contrary to punish myself for\r\nthis humiliating weakness, I was more severe than ever; and when the\r\npatient became well enough to thank me for my kind attention, etc., I\r\ntold him, as coldly as I could, that it was no more than I would have\r\ndone for the commonest soldier--(which was not strict truth)--that my\r\nlabors were given to my country, and not to individuals--with much more\r\nto the same purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers sighed deeply, and turned over on his pillow; and he did not\r\nimagine how I felt.\r\n\r\nHe said no more on the subject then; but, one evening, when he had been\r\nmoved from his bed to an easy chair, he spoke out like a man, and a\r\npretty determined one, too, in plain terms, and asked me if I would ever\r\nmarry him?\r\n\r\nIn just as plain terms I told him that I never would--I had resolved to\r\ndevote my life in this manner; and, with an expression of utter\r\nhopelessness, he replied that he took back all his thanks for the\r\nmiserable life I had saved; he was weary of it, and would hasten to\r\nthrow it away on the next battle field.\r\n\r\nThis was very dreadful, of course; but that winter's practice had given\r\nme quite a turn for arithmetic, and I fell to calculating how many\r\nbattles would probably transpire before that crippled shoulder would let\r\nhim take the field again.\r\n\r\n'You will not get out under three months,' said I, confidently.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a moment; and then, bending closer, he whispered,\r\n'You do not really mean it, Isabel?'\r\n\r\nMy face flushed uncomfortably at this address, but, making a last\r\nstruggle, I inquired carelessly, 'And why not, pray?'\r\n\r\n'Because,' he replied, with a steady voice, 'you have too kind a heart\r\nto consign to a disappointed life one who loves you so devotedly.'\r\n\r\nI suppose I had; for, after that, he had the impudence to assure me that\r\nI was engaged to him.\r\n\r\n'Providence seems to smile upon us,' observed my convalescing patient,\r\nthe next morning; 'read this, Isabel.'\r\n\r\nThe formidable looking document was placed in my hand, and I learned\r\nthat Lieutenant Elihu Summers, for gallant conduct at the battle of Bull\r\nRun, was promoted to the rank of colonel.\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Colonel Summers,' said he, with the old mischief beaming in his\r\neye; 'isn't that tempting?'\r\n\r\nI immediately punished him by reading an article that happened to be on\r\nhand, which proved conclusively that army and navy officers were a\r\nworthless, dissipated set. Nevertheless, it was a satisfaction to think\r\nthat my wish of entering the army was about to be gratified--although in\r\nsuch an unexpected way.\r\n\r\nI could never definitely ascertain whether Helen Legram loved Mr.\r\nSummers or not; but I am under the impression that she did, and that she\r\nwill never marry. She makes a splendid principal for the Peppersville\r\nAcademy; and, when we have a house of our own, she will be the first\r\ninvited guest.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that I have no 'mission.' I spoiled my school teaching by\r\nfalling in love with the principal, and my hospital nursing by becoming\r\ninfatuated with my most troublesome patient. I do not feel disposed,\r\ntherefore, to try another field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Atossa, a Persian queen, the daughter of Cyrus and the mother of\r\nXerxes, has been ascribed the invention of letter writing. She, although\r\na royal barbarian, was, like her prototype of Sheba, not only an admirer\r\nof wisdom in others, but wise herself. She first composed epistles. So\r\ntestifies Hellanicus, a general historian of the ancient states, and so\r\ninsists Tatian in his celebrated oration against the Greeks. In that\r\noration he contends that none of the institutions of which the Greeks\r\nwere so boastful had their origin with them, but were all invented by\r\nthe barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted, however, whether to any known person in the domains\r\nof olden time can be truly attributed the high honor of such an\r\ninvention. Indeed, the views that may justly be entertained as to what\r\nconstitutes an invention may be various and diverse. Perhaps, in a\r\nqualified sense, any signal addition or improvement deserves to be so\r\ndistinguished. What was precisely the subject matter of Atossa's\r\ninvention is not told, nor is anything recorded to lead to the\r\nconclusion that she invented any new material; but, if she discovered\r\nany way of committing the communications between persons, separated or\r\nat a distance from each other, to paper--whether composed of the\r\ninterior bark of trees, or of the Egyptian papyrus, or other flexible\r\nsubstance--and making it into a roll or volume, to be sent by some\r\ncarrier, that Persian queen may be accredited as the inventress of\r\nepistolary composition.\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that letter writing was an art existing in the\r\ndays of Homer; because one of that great poet's characters, named\r\nPretus, gives a folded tablet to another personage, Bellerophontes, to\r\ndeliver to a third individual, Jobates. But the learned commentators,\r\nboth German and English, agree in the fact that the Iliad and the\r\nOdyssey were never written, but recited to various audiences by\r\n\r\n  'The grand old bard of Scio's rocky isle.'\r\n\r\nWriting, however, was in use throughout Greece before the time of Homer,\r\nif not in ordinary intercourse, certainly for memorials and\r\ninscriptions. The age of Homer may be regarded as preceding the\r\nChristian era by about one thousand years. It synchronizes with the time\r\nof Solomon. Thus the greatest of poets and the wisest of kings\r\ncoexisted--truly a noticeable fact, a theme for the imagination.\r\n\r\nBut the Holy Scriptures afford instances of letter writing, in some form\r\nor other, at a period considerably anterior to the age of Solomon. David\r\nwrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah: 'And he wrote\r\nin the letter, saying.' (2 Samuel xi, 14, 15.) And, about one hundred\r\nand forty years afterward, Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name (1 Kings\r\nxxi, 8, 9), and 'sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto\r\nthe elders and to the nobles that were in the city, dwelling with\r\nNaboth, and she wrote in the letters, saying, (2 Kings v, 5, 6, 7; 2\r\nKings x, 1, 2, 6, 7.) The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of\r\nIsrael, and therewith sent Naaman, his servant, to be cured of his\r\nleprosy: 'And it came to pass when the king of Israel read the letter,\r\nthat he rent his clothes.'\r\n\r\nNow this occurred about nine hundred years before the Christian era;\r\nand, about twenty years later, we are told that Jehu wrote letters and\r\nsent them to Samaria. A second time he transmitted other letters of a\r\nsimilar import, which were cruelly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThen there is the threatening letter of the king of Assyria to Hezekiah,\r\nset forth in the second book of Kings, and also the complimentary\r\nletter from Berodach-Baladan to the same king of Judah after his\r\nsickness; a king who subsequently appears himself to have written\r\nletters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, to summon them to\r\nJerusalem. (2 Kings xix, 14; xx, 12; 2 Chron. xxx, 1-6.)\r\n\r\nCyrus, after publishing his decree giving liberty to the Jews to return\r\nto their own country and rebuild the house of the Lord at Jerusalem,\r\nwrote letters recommendatory to the governors of several provinces to\r\nassist the Jews in their undertaking; one of which letters Josephus has\r\nrecorded as being addressed to the governors of Syria, and commencing\r\nwith the regular epistolary salutation, 'Cyrus, the king, to Sysina and\r\nSarabasan sendeth a greeting.' And while the children of the captivity\r\nwere rebuilding their temple (and this was five hundred and twenty-two\r\nyears before Christ), there was a frequent correspondence by letters\r\nbetween, their adversaries and Artaxerxes, king of Persia. Now,\r\nsupposing the invention, in any modified sense, of letter writing _on\r\npaper_, or what may answer to the idea conveyed by that term, is in any\r\nmeasure attributable to the daughter of Cyrus, this was quite a matter\r\nof course and in accordance with the general practice.\r\n\r\nStill, let us not be disposed to take away from the royal lady the honor\r\nof having invented an art which her sex have, in modern years, carried\r\nto a perfection scarcely attainable by the male sex; for it may be set\r\ndown as an axiom that one woman's letter is worth a dozen letters by\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the instances of communication by means of letter writing to\r\nwhich allusions have thus been made are plainly no specimens of that use\r\nof the invention which constitutes it the medium of free thought and\r\nintelligence, or even the simple vehicle of domestic intercourse. Those\r\nletters or missives were either formal announcements of authoritative\r\nmandates and despatches, or, at best, only the conveyancers of certain\r\ninformation, to be the motive to some act or understanding, or to\r\ndetermine or direct some course of proceeding. There are no examples of\r\nwhat can properly be called _familiar letters_ before the time of\r\nCicero, whose correspondence may justly be regarded as among the most\r\nprecious remains of ancient literature which have survived to our own\r\nday. In connection with this remark, we may be permitted to observe\r\nthat, as with the greatest of ancient, so with the greatest of modern\r\norators, he was distinguished for the beauty, power, and brilliancy of\r\nhis letters. There are few instances of English style more charming in\r\nthemselves than the epistles, whether published or still in manuscript,\r\nwritten by that versatile and wonderful person, Daniel Webster.\r\n(_Nunquam tetigit quod non ornavit._) How copious is their expression!\r\nHow facile and felicitous their illustrations! What grace! What beauty\r\nof diction! What simplicity, elevated by a matchless elegance! Nothing\r\nmore clearly proves the various talents of both the Roman and the\r\nAmerican statesman than that they should no more have excelled in their\r\nforensic achievements on grand occasions than in those common and\r\ntrivial affairs of every-day life, so unaffected and so effortless as\r\nthe writing of letters to their friends.\r\n\r\nAll the letters of Greek and Roman origin which have come down to us\r\nseem to be doubtful, except those of Plato and Isocrates, until the days\r\nof Cicero. Under his genius the mind of the Roman nation took a sudden\r\nspring, and the polite literature of the world was embellished by\r\nepistolary composition. As the rules and illustrations of poetic writing\r\nwere borrowed by Aristotle from the example of Homer, so the practice\r\nand authority of Cicero appear to have furnished precepts best entitled\r\nto determine the character and merits of the epistolary style. He\r\nesteemed it as a species of composition enjoying the privilege of great\r\nease and familiarity, as well in its diction as in its treatment of its\r\nsubject, and also in its employment of the weapons of wit and humor. The\r\ngeneral style most suitable to its spirit and character he considered to\r\nbe that most in use in the ordinary and daily intercourse of society. He\r\nadmired a simple and playful use of language, and he affected, as he\r\nasserts, a common and almost plebeian manner of writing, using words of\r\nevery-day stamp in his correspondence. In his view of letter writing,\r\nits style and manner ought to vary with the complexion of its subject\r\nmatter, and be subjected to no abstract system of rules. Ho propounds\r\nthree principal kinds of epistles: first, that which merely conveys\r\ninteresting intelligence, being, as he says, the very object for which\r\nthe thing itself came into existence; second, the jocose letter; third,\r\nthe serious and solemn letter. And it was besides the opinion of the\r\ngreat orator--an opinion sanctioned and ratified by all honorable\r\npersons then and in our own day--that there is something sacred in the\r\ncontents of a letter which gives it the strongest claims to be withheld\r\nfrom third persons. 'For who,' he exclaims, in his second Philippic,\r\n'who that is at all influenced by good habits and feelings, has ever\r\nallowed himself to resent an affront or injury by exposing to others any\r\nletters received from the offending persons during their intercourse of\r\nfriendship?' 'What else,' he eloquently exclaims, 'would be the tendency\r\nof such conduct but to rob the very life of life of its social charms!\r\nHow many pleasantries find their way into letters, as amusing to the\r\ncorrespondents as they are insipid to others; and how many subjects of\r\nserious interest, which are entirely unfit to be brought before the\r\npublic!'\r\n\r\nTruly is it gratifying, in our treatment of this topic, to be able to\r\nadduce such high, classical authority concerning the sacred and\r\ninviolable character of all private correspondence. In our humble view,\r\nnot only is the seal of a letter a lock more impregnable to the hand of\r\nhonor than the strongest bank safe which the expert Mr. Hobbs might\r\nvainly have tried to open; but even when that seal has already been\r\nrightfully broken and the contents of the letter exposed, those contents\r\nare to the eye of delicacy as unreadable as if written in that _Bass_\r\nlanguage which Adam and Eve are said to have spoken while in the garden\r\nof Eden, and which, since the fall, none but angels have ever been able\r\nto comprehend. Now, if Cicero thought it base for a third party to read\r\na private letter, what eloquent thunder would he not have hurled at the\r\nhead of that wretch who not only read, but printed and published it!\r\nThere is an epithet, which, in certain parts of New England, the folks\r\napply to the poorest of poor scamps--'mean.' Now who, in this round\r\nworld, of all that dwell therein, can be found one half so 'mean' as the\r\nbetrayer and revealer of another's secrets? A whip should be placed in\r\nevery honest hand to lash the rascal naked through the world. He should\r\nbe fastened in an air-tight mail bag, and sent jolting and bouncing,\r\namid innumerable letters and packages and ponderous franked documents of\r\nmembers of Congress, over all the roughest roads of our Northwestern\r\ncountry!\r\n\r\nTo return to what a letter should be. It seems, upon the whole, to have\r\nbeen Cicero's opinion--and in this we shall fain agree as well as in his\r\nview of the secrecy of letters--that, whether the subject be solemn or\r\nfamiliar, learned or colloquial, general or particular, political or\r\ndomestic, an easy, vivacious, unaffected diction gives to epistolary\r\nwriting its proper grace and perfection.\r\n\r\nIn very truth, good letter writing is little else than conversation upon\r\npaper, carried on between parties personally separate, with this\r\nespecial advantage, that it brings the minds of the interlocutors into\r\nreciprocal action, with more room for reflection, and with, fewer\r\ndisturbances than can usually consist with personal conversation.\r\n\r\nWe have thus made mention of Cicero as the greatest of authorities with\r\nregard to this subject, because he was himself the greatest of letter\r\nwriters. The epistle was the shape in which his versatile and beautiful\r\nmind most gracefully ran and moulded itself. His fluctuating and\r\nunstable character no less than his vanity and love of distinction,\r\nseemed to minister occasion to those varied forms of diction and\r\nexpression in which the genius of animated letter writing may be said to\r\ndelight. Read his 'Familiar Letters,' if not in Latin, yet in\r\ntranslation, if you wish to study the most perfect specimens of this\r\nstyle--a style which has not been equalled or approached since his day.\r\n\r\nNext to the letters of the great Roman orator, merit points to those of\r\nthe philosopher Seneca. He, too, cultivates and enjoins an easy and\r\nunstudied diction. So great is the excellence of his letters; so nearly\r\nis their beauty allied to the beauty of our Holy Scriptures; so does he\r\nseem to anticipate the morals and teachings of our Christian\r\ndispensation, that it is almost reprehensible to speak of them at all,\r\nwithout setting forth their extraordinary charms of style and thought,\r\neven in a larger space than the present article can be allowed to\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nAfter Seneca, the next most noted of the ancient letter writers was\r\nPliny the younger. And now we are brought down to the days of the\r\nApostles and their Epistles. With a simple reverential allusion to the\r\nletters of St. Paul and the other immediate followers of our Lord,\r\nletters that teach men the way of salvation--we pass to a more modern\r\nconsideration of our topic.\r\n\r\nLetters can hardly be classified. They are of various sorts. Most of\r\nthem, as schoolboys say, end in t-i-o-n, _tion_. There are Letters of\r\nIntroduction; Letters of Congratulation; Letters of Consolation; Letters\r\nof Invitation; Letters of Recommendation; Letters of Administration.\r\nThere are, moreover, letters of friendship, business letters, letters of\r\ndiplomacy, letters of credit, letters patent, letters of marque (apt\r\nalso to be letters of mark), and love letters--the last being by no\r\nmeans least.\r\n\r\nLet not the gentle reader imagine from this enumeration than we are\r\ngoing to be so tedious as to divide the remainder of this article into\r\nheads, and to treat of each one of these kinds of letters in its turn.\r\nNo; our object is, by indicating thus the number of sorts, to elucidate\r\nthe importance of letters, and to prove that, if their writing be not,\r\nlike that of poetry, ranked among the fine arts, it well deserves to be.\r\nFor what more admirable accomplishment can there be--what is of more\r\nimportance often than the proper composing of letters? Many a reputation\r\nis made or marred by a single epistle. Great consequences follow in the\r\ntrain of a single epistle. The pen is mightier than the sword. How well\r\nmay our readers remember one brief letter of Henry Clay (_clarum et\r\nvenerabile nomen!_), who, when a candidate for the Presidency, wrote\r\nmany excellent letters, and too many--so many, indeed, that his\r\nadversaries indulged in pointless ridicule, and called him 'The Complete\r\nLetter Writer.' We allude, of course, to that brief letter to certain\r\nimportunate individuals in Alabama, which lost for him the decisive and\r\nfinal vote of New York, and made Mr. Polk President--its consequences\r\nbeing the war with Mexico, the acquisition and annexation of California,\r\nthe discovery of the gold mines--working an utter change in the\r\npolitical and commercial fortunes of the world, which would probably\r\nnever have taken place, or, at least, not in our century, but for that\r\none brief Alabama letter! It is, we believe, fully conceded that the\r\nsafest rule for becoming Chief Magistrate of our country is never to\r\nwrite a letter.\r\n\r\nMany a man and woman, who has written a letter and posted it, wishes\r\nardently that it could be recalled; and many a one who has something\r\ndisagreeable to say, and is obliged to say it in a letter because he has\r\npromised to write, wishes that he could send the letter in blank--like\r\nLarry O'Branigan to his wife Judy, when he was constrained to inform her\r\nthat he had been dismissed from his place, thus done into verse by the\r\nbard of Erin:\r\n\r\n  'As it was but last week that I sent you a letter,\r\n    You'll wonder, dear Judy, what this is about,\r\n  And, troth, it's a letter myself would like better,\r\n    Could I manage to leave the contents of it out.'\r\n\r\nExcellent, by the way, as this Hibernicism is, it is not so perfect as\r\nthe following, which it would be difficult for the most accomplished of\r\nPaddies to surpass. A man, dying, wrote an epistle, in which, stating\r\nthat he was near death, he took an affectionate farewell of his friends.\r\nHe left the letter open on a table near him, and expired before he had\r\ntime to complete it. His attendant, just after his demise, taking up the\r\ndefunct's pen, in which the ink was scarcely yet dry, added, by way of\r\npostcript, or rather _post-mortem-script_: 'Since writing the foregoing,\r\nI have died.'\r\n\r\nThere is more philosophy than one would at first imagine in the apology\r\nof him who said that his pen was so bad it could not spell correctly. To\r\nwrite a letter as it should be in all respects, to be what it ought to\r\nbe, orthographically, grammatically, rhetorically right, there should be\r\na good pen, good paper, good ink. Many a pleasant correspondence has\r\nbeen marred by want of these adjuncts; many an agreeable thought\r\narrested; many a composition, happily begun, hurried to an abrupt\r\nconclusion. And how many delightful letters have been omitted or\r\nneglected to be written by their want! We are not jesting. These\r\nconcomitants, together with nice envelopes, are as requisite to a\r\nrespectable epistle as becoming costume is to a lady. When we see a\r\nscrawling hand on coarse paper, ill folded, worse directed, and ending,\r\n'Yours in haste,' we think but little of the writer. Such a one may\r\ncomplain of being in a hurry, but ladies and gentlemen should always\r\ntake time to do well whatsoever they do at all. No letters should be\r\nwritten 'in haste' except angry ones, and the faster they are 'committed\r\nto paper' the better. We have found it a capital plan, when in hot\r\nwrath, to sit directly down and scratch off a furious letter, and then,\r\nhaving thus committed our ire to the paper, to commit that to the\r\nflames. The process is highly refrigerant, in any state of the weather.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more false than the phraseology of most letters. Many a\r\nletter is commenced with 'dear,' when the writer, if he dared express\r\nhis real sentiment, would use a very opposite word. But, be the\r\nsentiments of a letter what they may, true or false, real or affected,\r\nit is the desire of the present writer to insist upon the indispensable\r\nneatness of letters--that they should be externally faultless, however\r\ndefective inside. We regret to record the unpleasant fact that our\r\nAmerican ladies seldom write good hands, whereas a fair chirography is\r\nproperly considered as among the very first accomplishments for a\r\nwell-educated girl in England. Who ever saw a letter from a true English\r\nlady that was not faultless in its details? What nice, legible\r\npenmanship! How happily expressed! How trim and pretty a cover! How\r\nbeautiful and classic a seal! Very different these from the concomitants\r\nof half a sheet of ruled paper, scrawled over as if chickens had been\r\nwalking upon it, and folded slopingly, and held loosely together by a\r\nwafer!\r\n\r\nIt is an affectation of many lawyers and most literary people to write\r\nill, probably to create an impression that such is the vast importance\r\nof their occupations and lucubrations that they have not time to attend\r\nto so minor a matter as penmanship. A certain highly distinguished\r\ncounsellor of Massachusetts was said to have written so badly that he\r\ncould not comprehend his own legal opinions after he had put them on\r\npaper. Now such affectation is in very poor taste. Those who cannot\r\nwrite fairly and legibly had better go to school and practise until they\r\ncan. Incomprehensible writing is as bad as incomprehensible speaking. A\r\nclear enunciation is scarcely more important than a plain hand. A\r\nlawyer, in speaking, may as well jumble his words so together that not\r\none in fifty can be understood, as in writing to scrawl and run them\r\nabout so that not one in fifty can be read.\r\n\r\nWhat a world of content or of unhappiness lies within the little fold of\r\na letter! Hark! There is the postman's ring at the door, sharp, quick,\r\nimperative; as much as to say, 'Don't, keep me standing here; I'm in a\r\nhurry.' How your heart beats! It has come at length--the long-expected\r\nletter; an answer to a proposal of marriage, perhaps; a reply to an\r\nurgent inquiry concerning a matter of business; information with regard\r\nto some near and dear relative; a bulletin from the field of battle;\r\nwhat the heart sighs for, hopes for--fears, yet welcomes--desires, yet\r\ndreads. You seize the letter. Has it a black seal? Yes? The blood leaves\r\nyour cheeks and rushes to its citadel, frozen with fear, and in your ear\r\nsounds the knell of a departed joy. No? Then you heave a long sigh of\r\nrelief, and gaze for a moment at the missive, wondering from whom it can\r\nbe. Your doubts are soon resolved, and you rest satisfied or you are\r\ndisappointed. Recall the emotions which you have experienced in opening\r\nand reading many a letter, and you will acknowledge that fate and\r\nfortune often announce their happiest or sternest decrees through a\r\nlittle sheet of folded paper. Have you not thought so, wife, when came\r\nthe long looked-for, long hoped-for, long prayed-for--with so many sighs\r\nand tears, such throbbing, and such sinking of the heart--letter from\r\nyour husband, telling the fruition of his schemes, and the prospect of\r\nhis speedy return? Have you not thought so, mother, when your son's\r\nletter came, assuring you that your early teachings had been blessed to\r\nhim; and, though perchance surrounded by the temptations of a great city\r\nor a great camp, he had found that 'peace which passeth understanding?'\r\nHave you not thought so, O happy damsel--yes! that blush tells how\r\ndeeply--when _his_ letter came at last, that letter which told you you\r\nwere beloved, and that all his future felicity depended upon your reply?\r\nAnd that soft reply--how covered with kisses, how worn in that pocket of\r\nthe coat in which it can feel the beatings of the precordial region! And\r\nnot of you alone, ye refined and accomplished lovers--but of swains and\r\nsweethearts are the letters dear. Nothing more prized than such\r\nepistles, commencing with: 'This comes to inform you that I am well,\r\nsaving a bad cold, and hope you enjoy the same blessing,' and ending:\r\n\r\n  'My pen is poor, my ink is pale,\r\n  My love for you shall never fail.'\r\n\r\nAssuredly, if there can be unalloyed happiness in this world, it\r\nappertains to those dear and distant friends, parted from one another by\r\nintervening ocean or continent, at those moments of mental communion\r\nwhich are vouchsafed by long and loving letters. Ah, how would the bands\r\nof friendship weaken and drop apart if it were not for them! They\r\nbrighten the links of our social affections; they freshen the verdure of\r\nkind thoughts; they are like the morning dew and the evening rain to\r\nfilial, conjugal, fraternal, paternal and parental love!\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to say something concerning those different kinds of\r\nletters that we named. Letters of diplomacy are affairs in which words\r\nare used for the purpose of concealing or obscuring the author's\r\nmeaning, and which always conclude: 'Yours, with distinguished\r\nconsideration.' To this species of epistle, the 'non-committal style,'\r\nof which the late Martin Van Buren was reputed to be a perfect master,\r\nis best adapted. Diplomatists seldom desire to be comprehended; but\r\noccasionally, when they do, how luminously plain they can be! Witness\r\nthat celebrated letter which Mr. Webster dictated to Edward Everett, and\r\nthe latter put on paper to be sent to Austria's minister, the Chevalier\r\nHulsemann. The 'distinguished consideration' of that discomfited\r\nofficial was exercised to an unpleasant extent; and the result is that\r\nAustria has ceased to instruct this republic.\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult to compose than a letter of consolation or\r\ncondolence. The more earnestly you desire to express sympathy and impart\r\nsolace, the more impossible it seems to find gentle and appropriate\r\nterms. You would shun commonplaces and avoid sermonizing. You wish to\r\nsay something simple, kind, soothing. And yet the reflection of how far\r\nshort of the exigencies of the grief you would mitigate, fails your best\r\nand most effectual efforts, oppresses and restrains your pen.\r\n\r\nOf letters of business, it is quite well to say as little as they say\r\nthemselves: 'Yours received; contents noted. Yours, &c.' As brevity is\r\nthe soul of wit, so is it the soul of a business letter--the argument of\r\nwhich should be _ad rem_, to the matter; _cum punctu_, with point.\r\n\r\nLetters of invitation and congratulation are often mere formalities,\r\nalthough there is a way of infusing kindness, courtesy, and sincerity\r\ninto them, especially into the latter, which ought at least to seem to\r\nbe in cordial earnest.\r\n\r\nLetters of introduction and recommendation are very difficult to write,\r\nbecause most people endeavor to give an original turn to their\r\nexpressions. After all, it is judicious, in the composition of such\r\naffairs, to follow the briefest and most usual formulas, unless, indeed,\r\nyou desire to introduce and recommend some particular person in\r\ndownright reality, and then the farther you deviate from mere customary\r\nexpressions the better. And if you are truly in earnest, you need be at\r\nno loss what to say: the words will suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nLetters of friendship may be divided into two sorts--real and pretended.\r\nA real letter of friendship commends itself directly to the heart. There\r\nis a warm, genial glow about it, as welcome as the blaze of a hickory or\r\nsea-coal fire to one coming in from the cold, bitter breeze of a\r\nDecember night. It makes one philanthropic and a believer in human\r\ngoodness. What cheer--what ardent cheer is there in a letter\r\nunexpectedly received from an old friend between whom and one's self\r\nroll years of absence, or stretch lands and seas of distance! It is like\r\na boon from the very heaven of memory. But a pretended letter of\r\nfriendship--how easily detected! how transparent its falsity! The\r\nloadstone of love touches it, and finds it mere brass. Its influence is\r\nicy and bleak, like the rays of the moon, from which all the lenses on\r\nearth cannot extract one particle of heat.\r\n\r\nAnd what can be said of love letters--those flowers of feeling, those\r\nredundant roses of recapitulation? There is one strain running through\r\ntheir first parts, and then--_da capo_. They are the same thing, over\r\nand over and over again, and then--repeat. Yet are they never wearisome\r\nto those who write or to those who acceptably receive. They are like the\r\ninterviews of their writers, excessively stupid to everybody else, but\r\nexquisitely charming to themselves; that is, _real_ love letters; not\r\nthose absurd things--amusing from their very absurdity--which novelists\r\npalm off upon innocent readers as the correspondence of heroes and\r\nheroines. Verily is there a distinction between letters written by\r\nlovers and love letters. The former may be deeply interesting to\r\nuninterested readers, while the latter are the very quintessence of\r\negotistical selfishness; for, indeed, lovers may sometimes write about\r\nother matters besides love, as, for example, in the famous epistles of\r\nAbelard and Héloïse.\r\n\r\n  'Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,\r\n  Some banish'd lover or some captive maid;\r\n  They live, they breathe, they speak what love inspires,\r\n  Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;\r\n  The virgin's wish without her fears impart,\r\n  Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart;\r\n  Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,\r\n  And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole.'\r\n\r\nAbout the other kinds of letters which have been enumerated, we shall\r\nhave nothing to say; because they are letters rather in name than in\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nThe fashion prevalent in modern days, to publish on the demise of an\r\nauthor pretty much all his private correspondence, proves the general\r\ninterest which is felt in mere letters. Many of these are utterly\r\nworthless, vastly inferior to those which constantly pass between\r\nfriends on the topics of the hour or their own affairs. It is charitable\r\nto conjecture that their writers never imagined that they could be\r\nexposed in print, or would not be burned as soon as read. And yet, with\r\nwhat avidity are they conned and discussed! Look at the letters of Lord\r\nByron, Moore, and Campbell. How much brainless twattle do they contain,\r\namid a few grains of wit and humor. What mere commonplace! Editors may\r\nas well publish every word a man says, as what he writes familiarly in\r\nhis dressing gown and slippers. We have not a doubt that by far the best\r\nletters ever written still remain unpublished. There are many printed\r\nvolumes of travels very inferior to those which could be made up from\r\nthe letters of private persons abroad, composed purely for the\r\ndelectation of friends. There is hardly anything so difficult in writing\r\nas to write with ease. They who write letters on purpose to be\r\npublished, feel and show a constraint which a mere private correspondent\r\nnever entertains nor exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe war in which we are engaged has brought forth whole hosts of\r\ncorrespondents. They come not single spies, but in battalions. None of\r\nthese letters, so far as we have read, can boast of any striking or\r\npeculiar excellence. Their great fault is their immense prolixity. Their\r\nwords far outnumber their facts. An editor having once complained to a\r\nwriter of the inordinate length of his composition, the writer replied\r\nthat he had not had time to make it _shorter_. This is doubtless the\r\ntrouble with our army letter writers. They are forced to write _currente\r\ncalamo_--sometimes on the heads of drums, and not unfrequently are such\r\nepistles as full of sound and fury and as empty as the things on which\r\nthey are written. The best of these correspondents so far is the\r\nsomewhat ignominious Mr. Russell, of the London _Times_; the only one,\r\nindeed, who has achieved a reputation. Mr. Charles Mackay, his successor\r\n(_heu! quantum mutatus ab illo_), writes letters that are poorer, if\r\npossible, than his poems; he has just sufficient imagination to be\r\nindebted to it for his facts. As for his opinions, he seems to gather\r\nthem, like a ragpicker, from political stews, reeking with the filth of\r\ntreason and foul with the garbage of secession.\r\n\r\nSo far as _literary_ merit goes, we regret to give our verdict in favor\r\nof correspondents for the Southern journals. They write with greater\r\nfacility, greater elegance, and greater force than our own too\r\nvoluminous reporters. But, as much as they have figured, it is not\r\nprobable that they will live in print. They are like exhalations over a\r\nbattle field--touched briefly by the hues of sunlight, then fading,\r\nrolling off, and vanishing in the distance.\r\n\r\nOf all the methods of acquiring a good English style, there is no\r\npractice so beneficial as that of frequent and familiar letter writing.\r\nBecause your object in writing to a friend is to make yourself perfectly\r\nclear to him, therefore you make use of the simplest, plainest, readiest\r\nwords--and such are ever the best for an essay, sermon, lecture, or even\r\noration. This practice imparts ease and perspicuity, and it teaches that\r\nwriting ought to be and may be as little difficult as conversation. It\r\nteaches every one not to say anything till he shall have something to\r\nsay. A want of something to say is generally not felt in writing\r\nletters, especially by ladies; but it would seem to be a great pity that\r\nthere are so many words in our language; for, whenever one desires to\r\nsay anything, three or four ways of saying it run in one's head\r\ntogether, and it is hard to choose the best! It is quite as puzzling to\r\na lady as the choice of a ribbon or a--husband. But let us earnestly\r\nadvise all fair letter writers to lessen their perplexity by restricting\r\nthemselves to words of home manufacture. They may perhaps think it looks\r\nprettily to garnish their correspondence with such phrases as _de tout\r\nmon coeur_. Now, _with all my heart_ is really better English; the\r\nonly advantage on the side of the former expression is that it is far\r\nless sincere. French silks and French laces may be superior, but it is\r\nmuch better to make use of the English language. Whenever there is any\r\ndoubt between two words or expressions, choose the plainest, the\r\ncommonest, the most idiomatic. Let ladies eschew fine phrases as they\r\nwould _rouge_; let them love simple words as they do native roses on\r\ntheir cheeks. A true lady should be emulous to deserve that praise which\r\nthe old poet Chaucer bestows on his Virginia:\r\n\r\n  'Though she were wise as Pallas, dare I sain\r\n  Her faconde eke full womanly and plain,\r\n  No contrefeted terms hadde she\r\n  To semen wise; but after her degree\r\n  She spake; and all her wordes more or less\r\n  Sounding in virtue and in gentilesse.'\r\n\r\nExquisite examples of this pure, mother English are to be found in the\r\nspeeches put by Shakspeare into the mouths of his female characters.\r\n\r\n  'No fountain from its rocky cave\r\n  E'er tripped with foot more free;'\r\n\r\nnever were its waters clearer, more translucent, or more musical. This\r\nis indeed the peculiar beauty of a feminine style--choice and elegant\r\nwords, but such as are familiar in well-bred conversation; words, not\r\nused scientifically, but according to their customary signification. It\r\nis from being guided wholly by usage, undisturbed by extraneous\r\nconsiderations, and from their characteristic fineness of discernment\r\nwith regard to what is fit and appropriate, as well as from their being\r\nmuch less influenced by the vanity of fine writing, that sensible,\r\neducated women have a grace of style so rarely attainable by men. What\r\nare called the graces of composition are often its blemishes. There is\r\nno better test of beauties or defects of style than to judge them by the\r\nstandard of letter writing. An expression, a phrase, a figure of speech,\r\nthought to be very splendid in itself, would often appear perfectly\r\nridiculous if introduced in a letter. The rule of the cynic is a pretty\r\ngood one, after all: _In writing, when you think you have done something\r\nparticularly brilliant, strike it out._\r\n\r\nWe are pretty well persuaded that authors are but poor judges of their\r\nown productions. They pride themselves on what they did with most labor.\r\nIt is not good praise of any work to say that it is 'elaborate.' An\r\nauthor's letters are not apt to be labored, 'to smell of the lamp;' and\r\nthey are, therefore, in general, his best specimens. In letter writing\r\nthere will be found a facility, a freedom from constraint, a\r\nsimplicity, and a directness, which are the capital traits of a good\r\nstyle. Of Shakspeare it is said, in the preface to the first edition of\r\nhis works: 'His mind and hand went together, and what he thought he\r\nuttered with that easiness, that we have scarce received from him a blot\r\nin his papers.' Shakspeare did not, therefore,\r\n\r\n  'Write with fury, and correct with phlegm;'\r\n\r\nbut he wrote straightforwardly and naturally, as they do who assiduously\r\npractise letter writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Come, gentle Snowdrop, come; we welcome thee:\r\n    Shine, fiery Crocus, through that dewy tear!\r\n  That thou, arrayed in burnished gold, may'st be\r\n    A morning star to hail the dawning year.\r\n\r\n  Now Winter hath ta'en Summer by the hand,\r\n   And kissed her on her cheek so fair and clear;\r\n  While Spring strews bridal blossoms o'er the land\r\n    To grace the marriage of the youthful year.\r\n\r\n  The blackbird sings upon the budding spray,\r\n    I hear the clarion tones of chanticleer,\r\n  And robins chirp about from break of day,--\r\n    All pipe their carols to the opening year.\r\n\r\n  The butterfly mounts up on jewelled wing,\r\n    Risen to new life from out her prison drear:\r\n  All Nature smileth;--every living thing\r\n    Breaks forth in praises of the gladsome year.\r\n\r\n  Down in the sheltered valley, Mayflowers blow,--\r\n    Their small, sweet, odorous cups in beauty peer\r\n  Forth from their mother's breast in softened glow,\r\n    To deck the vestments of the princely year.\r\n\r\n  And splendid flowers in richly-colored dress\r\n    Will bloom when warm winds from the south shall veer:\r\n  And clustering roses in their gorgeousness\r\n    Shall form a coronet for the regal year.\r\n\r\n  Rejoice, O beauteous Earth--O shining Sea!\r\n    Rejoice, calm Summer sky, and all things dear:\r\n  Give thanks, and let your joyful singing be\r\n    An anthem for the glories of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AMERICAN CRISIS.\r\n\r\n_PART ONE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American crisis, actual and impending; the causes which have led to\r\nit through the years that have passed; the consequences which must flow\r\nfrom it; the new responsibilities which it devolves on us as a people in\r\nthe practical sphere; the new theoretical problems which it forces upon\r\nour consideration--everything, in fine, which concerns it, constitutes\r\nit a subject of the most momentous importance. The greatest experiment\r\never yet instituted to bring the progress of humanity to a higher plane\r\nof development is being worked out on this continent and in this age;\r\nand the war now progressing between the Northern and the Southern States\r\nis, in a marked sense, the acme and critical ordeal to which that\r\nexperiment is brought.\r\n\r\nFirst in order, in any methodical consideration of the subject, is the\r\nquestion of the causes which have led to this open outburst of collision\r\nand antagonism between the two great sections of a common country, whose\r\ninstitutions have hitherto been--with one remarkable exception--so\r\nsimilar as to be almost identical. Look at the subject as we will, the\r\nfact reveals itself more and more that the one exception alluded to is\r\nthe 'head and front of this offending,' the heart and core of this\r\ngigantic difficulty, the one and sole cause of the desperate attempt now\r\nbeing waged to disturb and break up the process of experiment, otherwise\r\nso peacefully and harmoniously progressing, in favor of the freedom of\r\nman. There is no possibility of grappling rightly with the difficulty\r\nitself, unless we understand to the bottom the nature of the disease.\r\n\r\nWhen the question is considered of the causes of the present war, the\r\nsuperficial and incidental features of the subject--the mere symptoms of\r\nthe development of the deep-seated affection in the central constitution\r\nof our national life--are firstly observed. Some men perceive that the\r\nSouth were disaffected by the election of Abraham Lincoln and the\r\nsuccess of the Republican party, and see no farther than this. Some see\r\nthat the Northern philanthropists had persisted in the agitation of the\r\nsubject of slavery, and that this persistency had so provoked and\r\nagitated the minds of Southern man that their feelings had become heated\r\nand irritated, and that they were ready for any rash and unadvised step.\r\nOthers see the causes of the war in the prevalence of ignorance among\r\nthe masses of the Southern people, the exclusion of the ordinary sources\r\nof information from their minds, the facility with which they have been\r\nimposed on by false and malignant reports of the intentions of the\r\nNorthern people, or a portion of the Northern people. Others find the\r\nsame causes in the unfortunate prevalence at the South of certain\r\npolitical heresies, as Nullification, Secession, and the exaggerated\r\ntheory of State Rights.\r\n\r\nA member of President Lincoln's cabinet, speaking of its causes, near\r\nthe commencement of the war, says:\r\n\r\n     'For the last ten years an angry controversy has existed upon this\r\n     question of Slavery. The minds of the people of the South have been\r\n     deceived by the artful representations of demagogues, who have\r\n     assured them that the people of the North were determined to bring\r\n     the power of this Government to bear upon them for the purpose of\r\n     crushing out this institution of slavery. I ask you, is there any\r\n     truth in this charge? _Has the Government of the United States, in\r\n     any single instance, by any one solitary act, interfered with the\r\n     institutions of the South? No, not in one._'\r\n\r\nBut let us go behind the symptoms--let us dive deeper than the\r\nsuperficial manifestations--let us ask why is it that the South were so\r\nspecially disaffected by the election of a given individual, or the\r\nsuccess of a given political party, to an extent and with an expression\r\ngiven to that disaffection wholly disproportionate to any such cause,\r\nand wholly unknown to the political usages of the land? Why is the South\r\nsusceptible to this intense degree of offence at the ordinary\r\ncontingency of defeat in a political encounter? Why, again, does the\r\npersistent discussion or agitation of _any_ subject tend so specially to\r\ninflame the Southern mind beyond all the ordinary limits of\r\nmoderation--to the denial of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the\r\npress, and finally of the right of national existence itself to the\r\nNorth--except in conformity with preconceived opinions and theories of\r\nits own? Why were they of the South standing ready, as to their mental\r\nposture, for any or every rash and unadvised step? Why, again, are the\r\nSouthern people uneducated and ignorant, as the predominant fact\r\nrespecting a majority of their population? Why is the state of popular\r\ninformation in that whole region of a nominally free country, such as to\r\nmake it an easy thing to impose upon their credulity and instruct them\r\ninto a full belief in the most absurd and monstrous fabrications, or\r\nfalsifications of the truth? Why were the ordinary sources of\r\ninformation excluded from their minds, more than from ours, or from the\r\npopulation of any other country? Why this fatal facility on the part of\r\nthe Southern public for being misled by the designing purposes of\r\nambitious demagogues; imbued with unjust prejudices; deluded into a\r\nmurderous assault upon their best friends, and into the infliction of\r\nthe most serious political injury upon themselves? Why, as a people, are\r\nthey prompt to rush from the pursuits of peace into all the horrors and\r\ncontingencies of war?--from the enjoyment of political freedom, at least\r\nnominal and apparent, into the arms of a military despotism, the natural\r\nand necessary ultimatum of the course which they have chosen to adopt?\r\n\r\nThe one and sole answer to all these questions is, Slavery. Some one has\r\nsaid, in speaking of the present crisis, that the sentiment of loyalty\r\nhas never been prevalent at the South. This is a grand mistake. No\r\npeople on the surface of the planet have more sincerely felt or more\r\ninvariably and unflinchingly demonstrated loyalty than they. But it is\r\nnot loyalty to the American Government, nor indeed to any political\r\ninstitutions whatsoever. It is loyalty to slavery and to cotton. No\r\nother ideas exist, with any marked prominence, at the South. The\r\nNorthern people have never understood the South, and their greatest\r\ndanger in the present collision results from that ignorance. The\r\ndifference between the two peoples is indeed so wide that it is not\r\nequalled by that which exists between any two nations of Europe--if we\r\nexcept, perhaps, the Western nations and the Turks. The single\r\ninstitution of slavery has, for the last sixty or seventy years, taken\r\nabsolute possession of the Southern mind, and moulded it in all ways to\r\nits own will. Everything is tolerated which does not interfere with it;\r\nnothing whatsoever is tolerated which does. No system of despotism was\r\never established on earth so thorough, so efficient, so all-seeing, so\r\nwatchful, so permeating, so unscrupulous, and so determined.\r\n\r\nThe inherent, vital principle of slavery is irresponsible, despotic\r\nrule. The child is born into the exercise of that right; his whole\r\nmental constitution is imbued with its exercise. Hence for twenty or\r\nthirty years--not by virtue of law, but against law--the mails have been\r\nsearched throughout the South for incendiary matter, with a strictness\r\nof censorship unknown to any Government of Europe. Northern men and\r\nEuropeans immigrating to the South have uniformly been quietly dragooned\r\nand terrorized into the acceptance of theories and usages wholly unknown\r\nto any free country;--quietly, only because the occasion for doing the\r\nsame thing violently and barbarously had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe two civilizations, North and South, are wholly unlike. Without the\r\nslavery of four millions of men, to be kept in subjection by a\r\nconspiracy to that effect, on the part of the whole free population--the\r\nlack of fidelity to which conspiracy is the only treason known in those\r\nregions--the existence of a people like the inhabitants of the Southern\r\nStates would be a riddle incapable of solution. Slavery itself, is _a\r\nremnant of barbarism overlapping the period of civilization_; but,\r\nunlike the slaveries of the barbaric ages, American slavery has been\r\nstimulated into all the enterprising and audacious energy of this\r\nadvanced and progressive age. It is an engine of ancient barbarism\r\nworked by the steam of modern intelligence. The character of the people\r\nwhich has been created under this rare and anomalous state of things is\r\nalike rare and anomalous. No other people ever so commingled in\r\nthemselves the elements of barbarous and even savage life with traits of\r\nthe highest civilization. No other community were ever so instinct with\r\nthe life of the worst ages of the past, and so endowed with the physical\r\nand intellectual potencies of the present. The national character of the\r\nSouth is that of the gentlemanly blackleg, bully, and desperado.\r\nCourteous when polished, but always overbearing; pretentious of a\r\nconventional sense of honor--which consists solely in a readiness to\r\nfight in the duel, the brawl, or the regular campaign, and to take\r\noffence on every occasion; with no trace of that modesty or delicacy of\r\nsentiment which constitutes the soul of true honor; ambitious,\r\nunscrupulous, bold; dashing and expert; with absolutely no restrictions\r\nfrom conscience, routine, or the ordinary suggestions of prudence; false\r\nand, like all braggarts, cowardly when beaten; confident of their own\r\nstrength until brought to the severest tests; capable of endurance and\r\nshifts of all kinds; awaiting none of the usual conditions of\r\nsuccess--the Southern man and the Southern people are neither\r\ncomfortable neighbors in a state of peace, nor enemies to be slightly\r\nconsidered or despised in war.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous character of Southern society, it cannot be too often\r\nrepeated, is not understood and cannot be understood by the people of\r\nthe North, or of Europe, otherwise than through the sharp experience of\r\nhostile and actual contact; nor otherwise than in the light of the\r\ninherent tendency and necessary educational influences of the one\r\ninstitution of slavery. Of the whole South, in degree, and of the\r\nSouthwestern States preëminently, it may be said as a whole description\r\nin a single form of expression: _They know no other virtue than brute\r\nphysical courage, and no other crime than abolitionism or\r\nnegro-stealing._\r\n\r\nAll this is said, not for the purpose of blackening the South, not from\r\npartisan rancor or local prejudice, or exaggerated patriotic zeal, but\r\nbecause it is true. It is not true, however, of the whole population of\r\nthe South, nor true, perhaps, in the absolute sense of any portion. It\r\nis impossible to characterize any people without a portion of individual\r\ninjustice, or to state the drift of an individual character even,\r\nwithout a like injustice to better traits, adverse to the general drift,\r\nand which, to constitute a complete inventory of national or personal\r\nattributes, should be enumerated. There is at the South a large\r\ncounterpoise, therefore, of adverse statement, which might be, and\r\nshould be made if the object of the present writing were a complete\r\nanalysis of the subject. It is, however, not so, but a statement of the\r\npreponderance of public character and opinion in those States. As a\r\npeople they have their countervailing side of advantage--a great deal of\r\namiability and refinement in certain neighborhoods, so long as their\r\ninherent right of domination is not disputed. Men and women are found,\r\nall over the South, who as individuals are better than the institution\r\nby which their characters are affected, and whose native goodness could\r\nnot be wholly spoiled by its adverse operation. Slavery, too, offers\r\ncertain advantages for some special kinds of culture. We of the North,\r\non the other hand, have our own vices of a kind not to be disguised nor\r\ndenied; so that the present statement should not be mistaken for an\r\nattempt to characterize in full either population. It is simply\r\nperceived that the grand distinctive drift of Southern society is\r\ndirectly away from the democratic moorings of our favorite republican\r\ninstitutions; is rapid in its current and irresistible in its momentum;\r\nand that already the divergency attained between the political and\r\npopular character of the people at the North and the South is immense;\r\nthat these constantly widening tendencies--one in behalf of more and\r\nmore practical enlargement of the liberty of the individual; the other\r\nbackward and downward toward the despotic political dogmas and practices\r\nof the ignorant and benighted past--have proceeded altogether beyond\r\nanything which has been seen and recognized by the people of the North;\r\nand that, consequently, the whole North has been acting under a\r\nmisapprehension.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the South is and has been belligerent, rancorous, and\r\nunscrupulous. The idea of settling any question by the discussion of\r\nprinciples, by mutual concessions, by the understanding, admission, and\r\ndefence of the rights of each, is not in all their thoughts. They are\r\ninherently and essentially invaders and conquerors, in disposition, and\r\nso far as it might chance to prove for them feasible, would ever be so\r\nin fact. War with them is therefore no matter of child's play, no matter\r\nof courtesy or chivalry toward enemies, except from a pompous and\r\ntheatrical show of a knightly character, which they do not possess;--it\r\nis simply a question of pillaging and enslaving, without let or\r\nhindrance from moral or humanitary considerations, to any extent to\r\nwhich they may find, by the experiment now inaugurated, their physical\r\npower to extend. The North, let it be repeated, entered into this war\r\nunder a misapprehension of the whole state of the case. It is at the\r\npresent hour, to a fearful extent, under the same misapprehension. There\r\nis still a belief prevailing that the South only needs to be coaxed or\r\ntreated kindly or magnanimously to be convinced that she has mistaken\r\nthe North; that she has not the grievances to complain of which she\r\nsupposes she has, and that she can yet obtain just and equitable\r\ntreatment from us. There is a tacit assumption in the minds of men that\r\nshe _must_ be content to receive the usage at our hands which we are\r\nconscious that we are ready to bestow, and which has in it no touch of\r\naggressive and unjust intention. It is not realized that the spirit of\r\nthe South, in respect to the North, in respect to Mexico, in respect to\r\nthe islands of the sea, and--should their power prove proportionate to\r\ntheir unscrupulous piratical aspirations--in respect to all the nations\r\nof the earth, is that of the burglar and the highwayman. It is not\r\nrealized that the institution of slavery--itself essential robbery of\r\nthe rights of man; covering the area of half a continent, and the number\r\nof four millions of subjects; planted in the midst of an intellectually\r\nenlightened people, whose moral sense it has utterly sapped--is\r\nessentially a great educational system, as all-pervading and influential\r\nover the minds of the whole population as the common schools of New\r\nEngland; and that this grand educational force tends toward and\r\nculminates in this same tendency toward robbery and the suppression of\r\nhuman rights or the individual and national rights of all other\r\npeople--expressed _in a collective and belligerent way_. It is not, as\r\nsaid before, that all men at the South are of this filibustering cast;\r\nbut the bold, enterprising, and leading class of the population are so,\r\nand the remainder are passive in their hands. Virtually and practically,\r\ntherefore, the South are a nation of people having far more relationship\r\nin thought and purpose with the old Romans during the period of the\r\nrepublic and the empire, or with the more modern Goths and Vandals and\r\nHuns, than they have with the England or New England of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is such a people, planted on our borders and aroused for the first\r\ntime to an exhibition on a large scale of those abiding and augmenting\r\nnational attributes and propensities which have thus been indicated,\r\nwith whom we are now brought into hostile array. They are at present\r\ntrying their hand at the collective and organic activities of a national\r\ncutthroatism which, in an individual and sporadic way, has for many\r\nyears past constituted the national life of that people. Who at the\r\nNorth, at the commencement of the war, impressively understood these\r\nfacts? Who even now sees and knows, as the fact is, that the military\r\nsuccess of Jefferson Davis; that his triumphant march on Philadelphia,\r\nNew York, and Boston--as they of the South threaten, and intend if they\r\nhave the power, and have already twice unsuccessfully attempted--would\r\nterminate not, in a separation of these States by a permanent disruption\r\nof the old Union; nor in new compromises of any kind whatsoever; but in\r\nthe absolute conquest of the whole North--not conquest even in any sense\r\nnow understood among civilized people; but conquest with more than all\r\nthe horrors which fourteen centuries ago were visited on Southern Europe\r\nby the overwhelming avalanche of Northern barbarian invasion?--that in\r\nthat event, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of\r\nlocomotion without question, freedom in any sense which makes life\r\nvaluable to the man once educated into the conception of freedom, is\r\nlost?--that the whole progress of modern civilization and development,\r\nas it has been working itself out in the Northern American States, would\r\nnot only be diverted from its course, but positively reversed and made\r\nto contribute all its accumulations of power to the building up, not of\r\nthe temple of Freedom for the blessing of the nations, but of an\r\ninfernal pantheon of Despotism and human oppression?\r\n\r\nThe North was forced, reluctantly and unwillingly, into this war: with\r\nher as yet it has hardly become a matter of earnest. She has endeavored\r\nto carry it on considerately and tenderly, for the well-being of the\r\nSouth as well as of the North, much in the spirit of a quiet Quaker\r\ngentleman unexpectedly set upon by a drunken rowdy, 'spoiling for a\r\nfight,' and whom in his benevolence and surprise, he is anxious indeed\r\nto restrain, but without inflicting on him serious injury. In an\r\nespecial degree was this tenderness felt on the part of the Government\r\nand people of the North toward that peculiar institution of the South\r\nwhich is distinctively known to be, in some way, fundamentally related\r\nto this unprovoked and unreasonable attack. While the South was\r\nattributing to the whole North a rabid abolitionism; while the North\r\nitself was half suspecting that it had committed some wrong in the\r\nexcess of its devotion to human rights; the simple fact on the contrary\r\nwas, that the whole North had been and was still 'psychologized' into a\r\npositive respect for slavery, and for slaves as property, which we feel\r\nfor no other species of property whatsoever. The existence of this\r\nsentiment of veneration for what our Abolition apostles have for some\r\nyears been denominating the 'sum of all villanies,' is a curious fact\r\nin the spiritual history of our people, which had very generally escaped\r\ncritical observation.\r\n\r\nAt the South, the individual planter, owning and possessing ten slaves,\r\nof an aggregate value, it may be, of ten thousand dollars, ranks higher,\r\nsocially, is regarded indeed, in some subtile way, as a richer man, than\r\nthe merchant or banker who may be worth his hundred thousand or half\r\nmillion of dollars, provided he has no slaves. To come to be the owner\r\nof negroes, and of more and more negroes, is the social ambition, the\r\naristocratic purpose and pretension of the whole Southern people. It is\r\nby virtue of this mystical _prestige_ of the institution itself; which\r\ncouples the charms of wealth with the exercise of authority, or a\r\ncertain show of official supremacy on the part of the master; which\r\nbegins by subjugating the imagination of the poorer classes, the whites\r\nthroughout the South, whose direct interests are wholly opposed to those\r\nof the slaveholding class, and ends by subjecting them, morally and\r\nspiritually, and binding them in the bonds of the most abject allegiance\r\nto the oligarchy of slaveholders. It is in this way that the South is\r\nmade a unit out of elements seemingly the most incongruous and radically\r\nopposed. For a series of years past, the South has sent forth its annual\r\ncaravan of wealthy planters to visit the watering places, and inhabit\r\nthe great hotels of the North. Coming in intimate contact with the\r\nsuperior classes of our own population; floating up in the atmosphere of\r\nserene self-complacency; radiating, shedding down upon those with whom\r\nthey chanced to associate, the ineffable consciousness of their own\r\nunquestionable superiority; they have communicated without effort on\r\ntheir part, and without suspicion on the part of those who were\r\ninoculated by their presence, the exact mould and pressure of their own\r\nslaveholding opinion. To this extent, and in this subtile and ethereal\r\nway, the North had imposed upon it, unconsciously, a certain respect,\r\namounting to veneration, for what may be called the sanctity of slavery,\r\nas it rests in and constitutes the aromal emanation from every Southern\r\nmind. Hence not only did we begin this war with the feeling of\r\ntenderness toward the Southern man and the Southern woman as brother and\r\nsister in the common heritage of patriotism, but, superadded to this,\r\nwith a _special_ sentiment of tenderness toward that _special_\r\ninstitution for which it is known that they, our brethren, entertain\r\nsuch _special_ regard.\r\n\r\nNow all this is rapidly changing; the outrages inflicted on citizens of\r\nthe North residing at the South at the opening of the war--hardly\r\nparalleled in the most barbarous ages in any other land;--their reckless\r\nand bloodthirsty methods of war; their bullying arrogance and\r\npresumption; the true exposition, in fine, of the Southern character as\r\nit is, in the place of a high-toned chivalry which they have claimed for\r\nthemselves, and which the people of the North have been tacitly inclined\r\nto accord--are all awakening the Government and the people to some\r\ngrowing sense of the real state of the case. Still, however, we are so\r\nfar dominated by these influences of the past, that we are not fighting\r\nthe South upon anything like a fair approximation to equal terms. They\r\nhave no other thought than to inflict on us of the North the greatest\r\namount of evil; the _animus_ of deadly war. We, on the other hand, fight\r\nan unwilling fight, with a constant _arrière pensée_ to the best\r\ninterests of the people whom we oppose--not even as _we_ might construe\r\nthose interests, but, by a curious tenderness and refinement of\r\ndelicacy, for those interests as _they_, from their point of view,\r\nconceive them to be. We forbear from striking the South in their most\r\nvital and defenceless point, while they forbear _in nothing_, and have\r\nno purpose of forbearance.\r\n\r\nWho doubts for a moment that a thousand mounted men, acting with the\r\nfreedom which characterized the movements of the detachment of Garibaldi\r\nin the Italian war, acting with the authorization of the Government,\r\nactuated by the spirit of a John Brown or a Nat Turner, sent, or rather\r\nlet go, into the mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, or Georgia, with\r\nthe authority to assemble and arm the slaves, retreating whenever\r\nassailed to the fastnesses of the mountains, would cause more terror in\r\nthose States; would do more, in a word, toward the actual conquest in\r\nthree months' time of those rebel commonwealths, than fifty or a hundred\r\ntimes their number organized in the regular forms of modern warfare,\r\noperating against the whites only, and half-committed to the coöperative\r\nprotection of the institution of slavery, would accomplish in a year?\r\nWho doubts for a moment that, if the South could find a like vulnerable\r\npoint in the openings of our armor, she would make, with no hesitation,\r\nthe most fearful and tremendous use of her advantage? The whole North is\r\naware of its possession, in its own hands, of this immense engine of\r\ndestructive power over its enemy. The whole civilized world stands by,\r\nbeholding us possessed of it, and expecting, as a simple matter of\r\ncourse, that we shall not fail to employ it--standing by indeed,\r\nperplexed and confused at the seeming lack of any significance in the\r\nwar itself, unless we make use of the power at our command in this\r\nfortuitous struggle, not only to inflict the greatest injury upon our\r\nenemy, but to extinguish forever the cause of the whole strife. Still we\r\nforbear to make the most efficient use of our advantage. We for a long\r\ntime embarrassed and partially crippled ourselves in all our movements\r\nby an almost unconscious sense of responsibility for the protection of\r\nthis very institution of slavery from the disastrous consequences which\r\nwere liable to fall upon it as the results of the war.\r\n\r\nTrue, we are slowly and gradually recovering from this perversion of\r\nopinion. The Emancipation Proclamation was probably issued as soon, or\r\nnearly as soon, as the Northern sentiment was prepared to give it even a\r\nmoral support. Another term had to expire to accustom the same public\r\nmind to appropriate the spirit of that document as matter of earnest; to\r\ncome to regard it as anything more than a mere _brutum fulmen_, a Pope's\r\nbull, as President Lincoln once called it himself, against the comet. Up\r\nto this hour, its effect on the war has been far more as a moral\r\ninfluence preparing for a great change of opinion and of conduct, than\r\nas a charter of efficient operations. General Thomas's action at the\r\nSouth, just previous to the capture of Vicksburg, began experimentally\r\nto inaugurate, on something like an adequate scale, the new programme of\r\npractical work in the conduct of the war. Even a month earlier his\r\nmovement would hardly have been tolerated by the same army, which, just\r\nthen beginning to appreciate the tremendous difficulty of the enterprise\r\nof conquering the South, were ready to accept anything new which\r\npromised to augment their own strength and to weaken that of the enemy.\r\nStill another term of waiting and suffering is requisite to change the\r\nhabit of mind which has so long despised and maltreated the negro,\r\nbefore he will be put, in all respects, upon the footing of his own\r\nmerit as a patriot and a soldier; and before all of his uses as the\r\nseverest goad in the sides of the hostile South will be fairly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThus in all ways we are only now in the midst of a revolution of\r\nopinion, which, when it is accomplished, will be seen to be the greatest\r\ntriumph of the war. Though we have spoken of this change as slowly and\r\ngradually occurring, yet, viewed with reference to the long periods of a\r\nnation's life, it is an immense revolution almost instantly effected. We\r\nare perhaps already one half prepared adequately to use our tremendous\r\nadvantage. New disasters may be providentially requisite to quicken our\r\neducation in the right direction; more punishment for our complicity in\r\nthe crimes of the South; new incentives to a more perfect love of\r\njustice as a people; but every indication points to the early\r\nachievement of these substantial victories over ourselves, while, at the\r\nsame time, we conquer the powerful array of Southern intrepidity and\r\ndesperation, in behalf of their bad cause, upon the external battle\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nTo resume the question of causes. Why is there, and why has there always\r\nbeen at the South this unfortunate prevalence of certain political\r\nheresies, as Nullification, Secession, and the exaggerated theory of\r\nState Rights?\r\n\r\nThe answer is still, slavery. The cause of causes, lying back of the\r\nwhole wide gulf of difference in Northern and Southern politics is\r\nstill, slavery. From the date of our Constitution, opinion has divided\r\ninto two great currents, North and South, in behalf of paramount\r\nallegiance to the General Government at the North, and paramount\r\nallegiance to the several State Governments at the South. The\r\nresolutions of '98 and '99 began the public expression of a political\r\nheresy, which has gone on augmenting at the South from that day to this.\r\nAt the North, the Government of the United States was never feared as\r\nlikely to become injurious in any sense to the inhabitants of the\r\nStates. Each State fell quietly and harmoniously into its true\r\nsubordinate orbit, acknowledging gladly and without question the\r\nsupremacy of the new Government, representative of the whole of the\r\npeople, in simple accord with the spirit and intention of the\r\nConstitution and the Government which the people had formed. At the\r\nSouth, on the contrary, the United States Government was, from the\r\nfirst, looked upon with a suspicion plainly expressed in the speech, for\r\nexample, of Patrick Henry, in the Virginia convention, which consented\r\nreluctantly that the State should come into the Union, lest the National\r\nGovernment might, in some unforeseen contingency, interfere with the\r\ninterests of the institution of slavery. That fear, the determination to\r\nhave it otherwise, to make the General Government, on the contrary, the\r\nengine and supporter of slavery, the propagandist of slavery, in fine;\r\nhas been always, since, the animating spirit of Southern political\r\ndoctrine. A doctrine so inaugurated and developed has endeavored to\r\nengraft itself by partisan alliance upon the Democratic party of the\r\nNorth, but always hitherto with an imperfect success. State Rights, as\r\naffirmed at the North, has never been a dogma of any considerable power,\r\nbecause it has rested on no substratum of suspicion against the General\r\nGovernment, nor of conspiracy to employ its enginery for special or\r\nlocal designs. At the South it has been vital and significant from the\r\nfirst, and it has grown more mischievous to the last. President Lincoln,\r\nin his first message, discussed, ably enough, the right of secession as\r\na mere constitutional or legal right. Others have done the same before\r\nand since. The opinion of the lawyer is all very well, but it has no\r\nspecial potency to restrain the nocturnal activities of the burglar. All\r\nsuch discussions are, for the present behalf, utterly puerile.\r\nSecession, revolution, the bloody destruction and extinction of the\r\nwhole nation, were for years before the war foregone determinations in\r\nthe Southern mind, to be resorted to at any instant at which such\r\nextreme measures might become necessary; not merely to prevent any\r\ninterference with the holy institution; but equally to secure that\r\nabsolute predominance of the slaveholding interest over the whole\r\npolitical concerns of the country which should protect it from\r\ninterference, and give to it all the expansion and potency which it\r\nmight see fit to claim. So long as that absolute domination could be\r\nmaintained within the administration of the Government, slavery and\r\nslaveholders were content to remain nominally republican and\r\ndemocratic--actually despots and unlimited rulers. But a contingency\r\nthreatened them in the future. The numerical growth of population at the\r\nNorth, the moral convictions of the North--both of these united, or some\r\nother unforeseen circumstance, might withdraw the operations of the\r\nGeneral Government from their exclusive control. To provide for that\r\npossible contingency, the doctrine of paramount allegiance to the\r\nindividual States, and secondary allegiance merely to the General\r\nGovernment--a perpetual indoctrination of incipient treason--was\r\ninvented, and has been sedulously taught at the South from the very\r\ninception of the Government. Hardly a child in attendance upon his\r\nlessons in an 'old-field' schoolhouse throughout that region but has\r\nbeen imbued with this primary devotion to the interests of his State;\r\ncertainly, not a young lawyer commencing to acquire his profession, and\r\nriding the circuit from county court-house to court-house, but has had\r\nthe doctrine drummed into his ears, of allegiance to his State; and when\r\nthe meaning and importance of that teaching was inquired for, he was\r\nimpressively and confidentially informed that the occasion might arise\r\nof collision between the South and the General Government on the subject\r\nof slavery; and that then it would be of the last importance that every\r\nSouthern man should be true to his section. Thus the way has been\r\nprepared through three generations of instruction, for the precise event\r\nwhich is now upon us, flaunting its pretensions as a new and accidental\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the North has suspected nothing of all this. Her own devotion\r\nand loyalty to the General Government have been constantly on the\r\nincrease, and she has taken it for granted that the same sentiments\r\nprevailed throughout the South. Hence the utter surprise felt at the\r\nenormous dimensions which the revolt so suddenly took on, and at the\r\nunaccountable defection of such numbers of Southern men from the army\r\nand the navy at the first call upon sectional loyalty. The question is\r\nnot one of legal or constitutional rights in accordance with the literal\r\nunderstanding of any parchment or document whatsoever. The most\r\ntriumphant arguments of President Lincoln or of anybody else have had in\r\nthe past, and have now, no actual relevancy to the question at the\r\nSouth, and might as well be totally spared. It is purely and simply that\r\nthe South are in dead earnest to have their own way, unchecked by any\r\nconsiderations of justice or right, or any other considerations of any\r\nkind whatsoever--less than the positive demonstration of their physical\r\ninability to accomplish their most cherished designs. Even in a\r\ntechnical way, the question is not most intelligibly stated as one of\r\nthe right of secession; it is the bald question of Paramount Allegiance;\r\nit is so understood at the South. The whole action of the South is based\r\nupon a thorough indoctrination into a political dogma never so much as\r\nfairly conceived of at the North as existing anywhere, until events now\r\ndeveloping themselves have revealed it, and which is not now even well\r\nunderstood among us. Back of this indoctrination again, and the sole\r\ncause of it, is the existence of the institution of slavery; its own\r\ninstinct from the first that it had no other ground of defence or hope\r\nof perpetuation but physical force; its fears of invasion and its\r\nobstinate determination to invade.\r\n\r\nThe supposition has, until quite recently, extensively prevailed in the\r\nNorthern mind that slavery is or was regarded at the South as a\r\nnecessary evil, borne because it was inherited from the past and because\r\nits removal had become now next to impossible. A certain school of\r\nNorthern philanthropists, headed, we believe, by Elihu Burritt, had gone\r\nso far, previous to the war, as to form a society and appeal to the\r\nNorthern people for aid to enable their Southern brethren, through such\r\naid, and finally, perhaps, through the interposition of the General\r\nGovernment, to rid themselves of this monster evil. This handful of\r\nkindly individuals must soon have discovered, had they come into actual\r\ncontact with the prevailing sentiment of the South, that their whole\r\nmovement was based upon a misapprehension of that sentiment. Thirty-five\r\nyears ago, and before the Northern abolition movement had taken root in\r\nthe land, it was a pleasant fiction for the Southern mind to speak\r\ndeprecatingly of the blame which they otherwise might seem to incur in\r\nthe mind of mankind for adhering to their barbarous institution; to\r\nplead their own conviction of its entire wrongfulness, and to\r\ncommiserate themselves for their utter inability to free themselves from\r\nits weight. A certain considerable freedom of discussion in relation to\r\nits abstract merits was allowed, with the tacit condition imposed,\r\nhowever, just as really though not as consciously as now, that slavery\r\nitself must not be disturbed. Talk which had in it any touch of genuine\r\nfeeling in favor of active exertion to rid the country of the\r\ninstitution as an evil, was then as effectually tabooed as it is to-day,\r\nwith some minor exceptions on the borders of the slaveholding region, in\r\nBaltimore, North Carolina, Eastern Tennessee, etc., and with the further\r\nexception when Virginia was terrified for a few weeks or months by the\r\nresults of a desperate insurrection. On the strength of these few\r\nexceptions, it has been claimed at the South, and still more\r\npersistently by Southern sympathizers at the North, that the whole drift\r\nand tendency of things at the South prior to the commencement of the\r\nabolition agitation at the North were toward gradual emancipation, and\r\nthat they would have ultimated at an early day in that result. This,\r\ntoo, is a pleasant fiction with the least possible percentage of truth\r\nat the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery, under the stimulus given to it by the\r\ninvention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, and the consequent\r\ndevelopment of the cotton-growing industry--aided, curiously enough, in\r\na certain sense, by the prohibition of the African slave trade, giving\r\nrise to the slave-rearing business in Virginia and Maryland--has all\r\nalong been exhibiting a steady, sturdy, and rapid growth. By the\r\nalliance, accidentally as it were, resulting from the prohibition of the\r\nslave trade, between the Southern and the Northern slaveholding States,\r\na robustness and consistency were given to the whole slaveholding\r\ninterest which possibly it might never have had under a different\r\npolicy. If the foreign importation of slaves had continued, that species\r\nof population would gradually have overrun the cotton-raising border of\r\nStates--would have overrun them to an extent threatening the safety of\r\nthe institution there by its own plethora--while from the southern line\r\nof North Carolina and Tennessee northward, where this extra-profitable\r\nindustry could not readily be extended, the temptation to the\r\nimportation of slaves would have been slight, no market existing for the\r\nhome increase. The hold of the institution would have been constantly\r\nweakened there in the affections of the white population; and, in those\r\nStates, there is a seeming probability that white labor and free labor\r\nwould have taken the place of the present system, as it did in the\r\nStates farther north. This would have deprived the Southern belt of\r\ncotton-raising and negro-holding States of that sympathy which, under\r\nexisting circumstances, they have steadily had from their more northern\r\nsisters, and favored an early extinction of the system. However this\r\nmight have been, as things are and have been actually, it is certain\r\nthat at no period has the growth of the slaveholding institution\r\nexhibited any weakness or defect of vitality. Like an infant giant, it\r\nhas steadily waxed stronger and stronger, and more and more arrogant\r\nand aggressive.\r\n\r\nWhen the anti-slavery agitation commenced at the North, the parties who\r\nengaged in it had no consciousness of the immense magnitude and potent\r\nvitality of the institution against which they proposed to carry on a\r\nmoral warfare. They supposed that, as a matter of course, they would\r\nfind a universal sympathy throughout the North with doctrines in behalf\r\nof freedom, where freedom was the basis of all our institutions, and\r\nwhere, apparently, there was no alliance of interest, no possible reason\r\nfor a sympathy with slavery or the denial of freedom to man. They were\r\nmet unexpectedly by a powerful current of semi-slaveholding opinion\r\npervading the whole area of the Free States, and ready to deny to them\r\nfree speech or the rightfulness of any effort to arouse the people to a\r\nconsideration of the subject. When, after some years of contest, this\r\ncurrent of prejudgment was partially reversed, and their new thought\r\nbegan to find audience by the Northern ear; when, strengthened by\r\nnumbers and the better comprehension of the subject by themselves; the\r\nincreased determination and enthusiasm which arose from the _esprit du\r\ncorps_; and the assurance--satisfactory to themselves at least--that\r\nthey were engaged in a good cause; they began to grapple more directly\r\nwith intensified and genuine pro-slavery sentiment at the South itself,\r\nthey were astonished to find that, instead of battling with a weak\r\nthing, they had engaged in moral strife with one of the most mighty\r\ninstitutions of the earth.\r\n\r\nPro-slavery sentiment at the South, inherently arrogant and aggressive,\r\nas already said, was, at the same time and from the same causes, aroused\r\nto the consciousness of its own strength. Called on to answer for the\r\nunseemly fact of its existence in the midst of these modern centuries,\r\nwhen the world boasts of human freedom and progression, it began by\r\nblushing for its hideous aspect and uttering feeble and deprecative\r\napologies. Not that it was at bottom ashamed of its existence, for\r\nslavery, like despotism of all sorts, is characteristically\r\nself-confident and proud; but because it had been allowed to grow up\r\nunder protest in the midst of free institutions, and among a people\r\nconscious of the incongruity of the relationship existing between them\r\nand it; and had so contracted the habit of apology, and the hypocritical\r\nprofession of regret for its own inherent wrongfulness. Provoked,\r\nhowever, to try its strength against the feeble assaults of the new\r\nfriends of freedom, finding all its demands readily yielded to, and\r\nitself victorious in every conflict, it soon threw off its false\r\nprofessions of modesty, pronounced itself free from every taint of\r\nwrong-doing, claimed to be the very corner stone and basis of free\r\ninstitutions themselves, the condition _sine qua non_ of all successful\r\nexperiment in republican and democratic organizations, and became boldly\r\nand openly the assailant and propagandist, instead of occupying any\r\nlonger the position of defence. Then followed the various attempts to\r\noverthrow and extinguish free speech in the capital of the nation by the\r\nuse of the bludgeon, to extend slavery by illegal and bloodthirsty means\r\nover the soil of Kansas, to strengthen the enactments of the fugitive\r\nslave law by new and more offensive provisions, and to cause the\r\nauthority of the Slave Power to be openly and confessedly recognized\r\nthroughout the whole land, as it had been for years secretly and warily\r\npredominant. The opposition to these measures of aggression ceased to be\r\nwholly confined to the mere handful of technical abolitionists, and to\r\nspread and to take possession of the minds of the whole people, exciting\r\nsurprise and alarm, and arousing them to some slight efforts at\r\nresistance. With this rising tendency to resist arose in like measure\r\nthe tendency of the slaveholding power to invade. The alternative was\r\nquietly but resolutely chosen in the minds of the leading politicians\r\nof the South to 'rule or ruin.' Preparation was made for retaining the\r\nabsolute control of the General Government at Washington, and for\r\nextending the influence of the peculiar institution over the whole North\r\nand all adjacent countries, so long as that policy should prove\r\npracticable; and, if by any contingency defeated in it, to break up the\r\nUnion as it existed, and reconstruct it upon terms which should place\r\nthe slaveholding aristocracy in that front rank of authority without\r\nquestion, to which, as a settled conviction, ever present and dominant\r\nin their minds, they alone, of all men, are preëminently entitled.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they imposed their weight more and more heavily upon the\r\nsuccessive administrations from Van Buren down to Buchanan, and were\r\nencouraged to find that, in proportion as they pressed harder in their\r\ndemands, proportionate concessions seldom failed to be made. The\r\nreaction at the North was nevertheless steadily progressing. Wisely\r\nperceiving that the first part of their _programme_ of action had nearly\r\nserved its day; that preparation must be made for entering on the second\r\nand more desperate part of their conspiracy against free government;\r\nthey forced on the crisis at the Democratic Convention in Charleston, by\r\ndemanding terms which, with the fire in the rear now regularly organized\r\nand steadily operative at the North, that party could not accede to,\r\nwithout consenting to its own death. A disruption ensued of the\r\nunnatural alliance between the Southern oligarchy and the Northern\r\nDemocracy, and the Southern leaders from that hour availed themselves of\r\ntheir sole remaining lease of power under the administration of Mr.\r\nBuchanan to strengthen their position by all means, honorable and\r\ndishonorable, for the coming conflict, which by them had been long\r\nplanned or at least looked forward to, as the probable contingency.\r\nHaving virtually the entire control of the General Government, they used\r\ntheir power for sending South the arms of the common country, for\r\ndisposing the army and navy in such ways as to leave them in the least\r\ndegree effective for opposing their designs; and with all the quietness\r\nand deliberation of a dying millionaire making his will, they prepared\r\nto begin the conflict which the lazy and confiding North had not even\r\nbegun to suspect as among the possibilities of the future; and to begin\r\nit absolutely upon their own terms.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said, perhaps, in relation to the causes of the\r\npresent war. The present stage of its development is such as might have\r\nbeen fairly anticipated from such a commencement. The South has had the\r\nadvantage of earnestness and concentration of purpose; of a warlike and\r\naggressive spirit; of prior preparation, and of a full knowledge from\r\nthe first of the desperate nature of the enterprise upon which they were\r\nabout to enter, with a readiness to meet all its contingencies, and,\r\nsince the great uprising, with no anticipation of easy work. The North\r\nwas hurried into a war for which it had no preparation, to which it had\r\nnever looked as a serious probability, and for which it had been\r\nstripped in a great measure, through the pilfering policy of the South,\r\nof the ordinary means at its command. A peaceable and highly civilized\r\npeople, among whom actual war upon its own soil had been unknown for\r\nnearly fifty years, and among whom the spirit of war, always so rife at\r\nthe South, was opposed and neutralized by a thousand industrial and\r\npeaceful propensities, was suddenly called into the field. Uninstructed\r\nat first in the real nature of the conflict, regarding it as an\r\nunreasonable disaffection, and therefore necessarily limited in extent,\r\nnot aroused even yet to a full consciousness of the momentous\r\nconsequences involved in the struggle and its gigantic proportions, they\r\nhave come to the work, in a great measure, unprepared. Their condition\r\nat its commencement was even less favorable than that of the British\r\nnation at the commencement of the Russian war. Both of these great\r\nindustrial peoples, with whom war had fallen among the traditions of the\r\npast, had to begin new struggles by learning anew the theory and\r\npractice of war. The Northern people rose, after the assault on Fort\r\nSumter demonstrated to them that the South was in earnest, with the\r\nunanimity and power as of a single man, but bewildered and uncertain\r\nwhich way to turn, or how to grapple with the strange and unaccountable\r\nmonster of rebellion which had suddenly precipitated himself among them.\r\nThe whole habits of the nation had to undergo a violent and rapid\r\nchange. A new educational experience had to be hurried through its\r\nsuccessive courses of instruction. The gristle on the bone of the new\r\nmilitary organization had to have time to harden. Sharp experiences had\r\nto be undergone, and will still have to be endured, as part of the price\r\nof tuition in the novel career to which we have been so unexpectedly\r\ncalled. Still, we have great power in reserve; no feeling of\r\ndiscouragement, no thought of abandoning the purpose of maintaining our\r\nintegrity as a people, no sense of weakness possesses our minds. Great\r\nand triumphant successes are attending our arms. State after State,\r\nswept at first wholly or in part into the vortex of revolt, is again\r\nincluded within our military lines and brought back to a partial\r\nallegiance. New questions are rising into importance. We pass from the\r\nconsideration of causes to that of results. It is a different and a\r\ndifficult work to forecast the future. It is a perilous experiment to\r\nenact the prophet or seer, but in another paper we shall venture at\r\nleast upon some suggestions which may have their uses in modulating that\r\nnational destiny which none of us have the power actually to create or\r\neven to foretell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_ it--to\r\nnot many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\ninteresting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\nintended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMiss Arabella Thorne was the daughter of an old citizen of New York, a\r\nworthy man, a plumber by trade, who, by means of plenty of work, small\r\ncompetition, and high prices, managed to scrape together fifty or sixty\r\nthousand dollars, which from time to time he judiciously invested in\r\nreal estate. Late in life he married a tall, lean, sour-visaged\r\nspinster, considerably past thirty, with nothing whatever to recommend\r\nher except that she belonged to one of the first families. The fact is,\r\nshe was a poor relation, and had all her life been passed around from\r\ncousin to cousin, each endeavoring to shift the burden as quick as\r\npossible. As she grew older she became more fretful and ill tempered,\r\nuntil it was a serious question with all interested how to dispose of\r\nher. Of late years she had taken to novel reading, and when engaged with\r\na favorite romance, she was so peevish and irritable, that, to use a\r\ncommon expression, there was no living with her.\r\n\r\nThings were at this pass when Thorn (he spelled his name without an\r\n_e_) was called to do some work at the house of Mr. de Silver, an uncle\r\nof the 'poor relation,' with whom she was then staying. This gentleman,\r\nwho for years had been at his wits' end to know what to do with his\r\nniece, conceived the design of marrying her to Thorn, who was in good\r\ncircumstances, and could give her a comfortable home. It so happened\r\nthat she was at that time absorbed with a novel (she always fancied\r\nherself the heroine) where the principal character was called on to make\r\na sacrifice, and by so doing married a nobleman in disguise. She\r\ntherefore was ready; but it was not without some difficulty that Thorn\r\nwas brought into the arrangement. However, the distinction of marrying\r\nso much above him, and the advantage which might avail to his children,\r\novercame his natural good sense, and the 'poor relation' became Mrs.\r\nThorn.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that Mrs. Thorn would have been the death of her\r\nhusband in a reasonably short period, had she not herself been suddenly\r\ncut off the second year of her married life, leaving an infant a few\r\nhours old, whom she named Arabella, after her last heroine, just as the\r\nbreath was leaving her body.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorn buried his wife, and was comforted. He never married again.\r\nHis eighteen months' experience was sufficient. He even consented to\r\ngive up the direction of the infant, who would _not_ be a poor relation\r\nlike her mother, to Mrs. de Silver, who proceeded to look after it quite\r\nas she would one of her own children.\r\n\r\n[And this was all because old Thorn was getting rich, and would probably\r\nnot marry again, and Arabella would have his money.]\r\n\r\nWhen Arabella was ten years old, her father died. By his will he made\r\nMr. de Silver his executor, but prudently forbade any sale of his real\r\nestate till his daughter should be twenty-one, when she was to enter\r\ninto possession. The personal property was ample for her meantime.\r\nArabella grew up quite as the adopted child of the De Silvers. They had\r\nno daughter, but were blessed with three sons. The youngest was but ten\r\nyears older than Arabella, for whom Mrs. de Silver had destined him.\r\nMiss Thorne (to whose name an _e_ had been mysteriously added) bore a\r\nstrong resemblance to her deceased mother, but there was one striking, I\r\nmay say overwhelming difference between them. Mrs. Thorn had all her\r\nlife been poor and dependent, and treated as such while thrown about\r\nfrom house to house for a precarious home. She was crossed and snubbed,\r\nand a naturally unamiable temper made a thousand times worse by the\r\ntreatment she received. Arabella was rich and independent, and spoiled\r\nby over indulgence to her idle whims and caprices. For Mrs. de Silver,\r\nintent on making the match, did not dare cross her dear Arabella in the\r\nleast thing. She was shrewd, and soon perceived that she controlled the\r\nsituation, and did not hesitate to take advantage of it. In fact, she\r\nkept everybody dancing attendance on her. Fond of admiration to an\r\nabsurd degree, she still had a constant suspicion that she was courted\r\nfor her money. As I have said, in person she resembled her mother, but\r\nhere wealth came in to do away with the resemblance. True, she was tall\r\nand angular, but she made up superbly, so that on looking at her one\r\nwould exclaim: 'What a stylish woman!' True, her features were homely,\r\nand her complexion without freshness, but over these were spread the\r\nmagic atmosphere of fashion and assured position. She had a\r\nconsciousness which repelled any idea that _she_ could be otherwise than\r\nhandsome, fascinating, intelligent, and everything else desirable, and\r\nthis consciousness actually produced, in a large majority, the pleasing\r\nillusion that she was really all these. But she was not. On the\r\ncontrary, stripped of the gloss, she was censorious, supercilious, and\r\nselfish. Deprived of her dressmaker, she was gaunt and unsightly.\r\nSeparated from her position, she would have been unbearable. Arabella\r\nhad many offers, of course, but she was too fond of her power and too\r\nsuspicious of an attempt on her purse to yield easily. She was enough of\r\na coquette not absolutely to destroy the hopes of an admirer, but\r\nmanaged to keep him dangling in her train. She had never absolutely\r\ndiscouraged young De Silver, but she would not commit herself even to\r\nMrs. de S., who still fondly hoped that the money of the industrious\r\nplumber would come into her family. So matters ran on till Miss Thorne\r\nwas of age. Mr. de Silver evidently did not suppose there was to be any\r\nchange in the management of his ward's affairs. He was soon undeceived.\r\nThe young lady, about two weeks after the event, asked for a private\r\ninterview with her guardian, and very quietly, after a series of polite\r\nphrases, announced that from that time she should herself take charge of\r\nher own property. There was nothing in this to which Mr. de Silver could\r\nobject. Beyond some advantages which he derived from its management,\r\nwithout injury to his ward, it was of no importance; but he was not a\r\nlittle mortified nevertheless. It looked as if there was a lack of\r\nconfidence in his management, but he could only assent, and say his\r\naccounts were ready for her inspection. The truth is that Arabella had\r\nmade some acquaintances who ranked a grade higher in the fashionable\r\nworld even than the De Silvers. They had impressed her with an idea that\r\nit would add to her importance to have her own 'solicitor' and take on\r\nherself the management of her affairs. To this end she had consulted Mr.\r\nFarrar, a well-known and experienced lawyer, who had been recommended to\r\nher by one of her friends. Just then speculation in real estate was\r\nrife, and prices had reached an extravagant point. The first thing which\r\nMiss Thorne did under the advice of Mr. Farrar, was to sell from time to\r\ntime, as opportunity offered, all the real estate which her father had\r\nleft her, and invest it in personal securities. In this way a very large\r\nsum was realized, and Miss Thorne's labors soon reduced to the simple\r\ntask of receiving her semi-annual dividends. Mr. Bennett had not\r\noverrated the value of her property when he pronounced her worth two\r\nhundred thousand dollars. On the contrary, it is probable one might add\r\nfifty thousand to the computation and be nearer the mark.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. de Silver saw the independent course Miss Thorne was pursuing,\r\nshe became still more assiduous in her efforts to please her dear\r\nArabella. The latter, since it was still convenient to live with the De\r\nSilvers, was sufficiently amiable, but she never omitted an opportunity\r\nto show that she was her own mistress and intended to continue so. The\r\nDe Silvers were Episcopalians, but they did not attend the most\r\nfashionable church. Miss Thorne very soon purchased an expensive pew in\r\nSt. Jude's, and although Mrs. de Silver kept a carriage which was always\r\nat Miss Thorne's disposal, the latter set up a handsome brougham of her\r\nown. The young lady, after joining her new church, had determined to\r\ndistinguish herself. She was not content with moderate performances. She\r\naspired to lead. She kept at the very height of fashion. Yet St. Jude's\r\nhad no more zealous member. She was an inveterate party goer, and\r\nnothing pleased her better than to have double engagements through the\r\nwhole season; but the period of Lent found her utterly _dévote_--a most\r\nzealous attendant on all the ordinances of the Church. She was very\r\nintimate with Mr. Myrtle, and it is probable no one had half so much\r\ninfluence with her as the Rev. Charles Myrtle himself. She had her\r\n_protégés_ also--generally some handsome young fellow about taking\r\norders, whose devotion to Miss Thorne was perfectly excruciating. Time\r\nwent on and Miss Arabella Thorne was carried along in the train of the\r\ntyrant. With the passing years she became more intensely fashionable,\r\nmore bigoted, more fond of admiration, more difficult to please. She had\r\nrefused so many offers, while she had coquetted so much, that young men\r\nbegan to avoid her. This greatly increased her natural irritability;\r\nmade her jealous of the success of every rising belle, censorious, ill\r\nnatured in remark, and generally disagreeable. When Hiram Meeker first\r\nsaw Miss Arabella Thorne in her pew at St. Jude's, the interesting young\r\nwoman was (dare I mention it?) already twenty-eight. In respect to\r\nappearance, she had altered very little since she was eighteen. So much\r\ndepended on her milliner, her dressmaker, her costumer, and her maid,\r\nand to their credit be it spoken, they performed their duty so well,\r\nthat the 'ravages' of the fashionable seasons she had passed through\r\nwere not at all visible. There were times when Miss Arabella Thorne\r\nwould confess to herself that she ought to marry. But with every\r\nsucceeding birthday came increased suspicion that she was sought only\r\nfor her fortune.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs when the shrewd wholesale drygoods\r\nmerchant, satisfied that all his cousin cared for in matrimony was\r\nmoney, conceived the idea of making a match between Hiram and the\r\nfashionable Arabella. It did not take the former long, after Mr. Bennett\r\nonce explained just how things stood, to comprehend exactly the\r\nsituation, and to form and mature his plans accordingly. He had\r\ncommitted a blunder, as Mr. Bennett termed it, in giving up Miss Tenant,\r\nbut that was a conventional mistake, if, which it is very doubtful,\r\nHiram ever admitted that it was a mistake. Here, however, he could bring\r\nhis keen knowledge of human nature to play, and once understanding the\r\ncharacter of Miss Thorne, he felt fully equal to the enterprise. In\r\nfact, Hiram was once more on his old ground, and he enjoyed the idea of\r\nthe contest he was about to engage in.\r\n\r\nMr. Myrtle was fully enlisted on Hiram's side. He was much pleased with\r\nthe addition of a wealthy, rising young man--and a proselyte besides--to\r\nhis church. He feared that Miss Thorne might in time be lost to it by\r\nher marrying outside of his congregation. Here was a capital chance to\r\nsecure _her_ and add to his own influence and popularity.\r\n\r\nHe was too astute to approach the subject directly. Miss Thorne might be\r\nsuspicious even of him. He would give her no opportunity. Mr. Myrtle was\r\ntoo polished and too refined a man, too dignified indeed, to even\r\n_appear_ in the light of a match maker. But assurance was conveyed by\r\nMrs. Myrtle to Mrs. Bennett, and thence _via_ Mr. Bennett confidentially\r\nto Hiram, that Mr. Myrtle might be relied on to do everything in his\r\npower in the delicate business.\r\n\r\nThus fortified, and conscious of the aid of the Bennett family, which\r\nwas a very strong point, our hero entered on the fall and winter\r\ncampaign, resolved before it was over to secure the two hundred thousand\r\ndollars of the fashionable Arabella, and, as it must needs be, that\r\ninestimable person along with it.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned their first sight of each other in church, and the\r\ncuriosity of Miss Thorne to know who the young man in the next pew could\r\nbe. And here Hiram's generalship must be specially noticed. Mrs. Bennett\r\nproposed to bring about an immediate introduction by arranging an\r\n_accidental_ meeting at her house. This Hiram peremptorily objected to;\r\nand in speaking on the subject with Mr. Bennett, with whom all his\r\nconversations were held, he displayed such a subtle insight into the\r\ncharacter, habits, and peculiarities of Miss Thorne, that Mr. Bennett\r\nwas amazed. He afterward told his wife she must let Hiram have his own\r\nway, as the fellow knew more than all of them.\r\n\r\nTwo parties came off the following week, to both of which Hiram was\r\ninvited through the influence of the Bennetts. Miss Thorne was of course\r\npresent. Hiram, now perfectly at his ease, and fashionably attired, made\r\nno insignificant display. He was introduced to a great many young\r\nladies, and saluting two or three of the most attractive, he paid at\r\ndifferent stages of the evening assiduous court to them. His waltzing\r\nwas really superb [O Hiram, what a change!], and not a few inquired,\r\n'Who is he?' Mrs. Bennett was really proud to answer, 'A cousin of ours.\r\nA very fine young man, indeed--very rich.'\r\n\r\nMiss Thorne did not ask any questions--not she; but she quickly\r\nrecognized in the waltzer the occupant of the pew who had already\r\nattracted her notice. She waited complacently for the moment when Hiram\r\nshould be led up to her for presentation, and she had already decided\r\njust how she should receive him. She was resolved to ruffle his\r\ncomplacency, and thus punish him for not paying his first tribute to her\r\ncharms; then, so she settled it, she would relax, and permit him to\r\nwaltz with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening passed, and the fashionable young man had made no\r\ndemonstration, she was amazed. Such a thing had never happened before.\r\nTo think he should not ask _her_, while he devoted half the evening to\r\nMiss Innis, who waltzed shockingly (every one knew that), and who had no\r\nmoney either!\r\n\r\nShe went home in a very uncomfortable state of mind.\r\n\r\nThe following Wednesday there was a repetition of this very scene. The\r\nparty was even more brilliant than the last, Miss Thorne more\r\nexquisitely dressed, but Hiram kept aloof. Miss Thorne had never been\r\nslighted before--never. This evening she was tempted to waive her pride,\r\nand inquire of her dear friend Mrs. Bennett, with whom she saw Hiram\r\nconversing--but the thought was too humiliating, and she forbore.\r\n\r\nHow she hated the wretch!--that is, as women hate, and as men like to be\r\nhated. What should she do? Could she endure to attend another party, and\r\nbe so treated? Why, the creature never even looked toward her! What\r\nright had he to dress so fashionably and to waltz with such ease, and in\r\nfact appear so well every way? To occupy quite by himself the very best\r\npew in St. Jude's, directly in front of her! What audacity! Then his\r\nprovoking _nonchalance_. Oh, what was she to do? She should go crazy.\r\nNot quite that. She would first inquire of Mr. Myrtle, in a very\r\ncareless manner. So she ran in that same morning on the accomplished\r\nclergyman, and was speedily in a full gallop of conversation.\r\n\r\n'By the way,' she exclaimed, at length, as if a new thought had suddenly\r\nstruck her, 'pray, tell me, who is my new neighbor? I intended asking\r\nthe last time I saw you, but forgot it.'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles Myrtle looked completely mystified, and asked with his\r\neyes, plainly as eyes could ask, 'Pray, what do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I see you don't take. I mean the new occupant of the Winslows' pew;\r\nsome relation, I suppose.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no. He is a cousin of the Bennetts, a young merchant, who has\r\npurchased the pew.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed? A good churchman, I hope, if he is to sit so near me.'\r\n\r\n'I should judge so. I am but slightly acquainted with him. Mrs. Bennett,\r\nhowever, speaks of him in the most enthusiastic terms. She says he has\r\nbut one fault (I mention it to save you young people from\r\ndisappointment), which is, that he is not fond of ladies' society.'\r\n\r\n'I know better,' interrupted Miss Thorne, betraying herself; for she was\r\nthinking of what she had witnessed at the two parties. Too much a woman\r\nof the world to blush or betray any embarrassment, she as quickly\r\nrecovered, and added, laughingly, 'No one can make me believe he takes\r\nall that pains with his dress for nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Now I think of it, he does dress in very good taste,' said Mr. Myrtle\r\ncarelessly. 'I think, however, what Mrs. Bennett meant to convey is that\r\nMr. Meeker is not a marrying man. She says he is very rich, and has a\r\nhorror of being caught, as it is called.'\r\n\r\n'So then his name is Meeker,' replied Miss Thorne, with an absent air,\r\nas if she had paid no attention to Mr. Myrtle's concluding observation,\r\nthough she had drunk in every word with eager interest.\r\n\r\n'Yes. You will probably meet him at the Bennetts', though I do not think\r\nhe would please you, Miss Arabella. [Mr. Myrtle knew the weakness of\r\nspinsters after reaching a certain age for being called by their first\r\nname.] You are too _exegeante_, my dear young lady, and Mr. Meeker is\r\ndevoted to affairs.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder Mrs. Myrtle does not return; she told me she would not be gone\r\ntwo minutes,' said Miss Thorne, with the air of complete indifference to\r\nwhat Mr. Myrtle was saying, which a fashionable thorough-bred knows so\r\nwell how to assume.\r\n\r\n'Here she is,' said Mr. Myrtle. 'I will leave you together, and go back\r\nto my labors. Good morning.'\r\n\r\nMiss Thorne by this time was really very much excited; so much so that\r\nshe could not resist speaking of Hiram to Mrs. Myrtle, though of course\r\nin the same accidental way in which she had inquired of her husband.\r\n\r\nMrs. Myrtle of course had much more to say in reply. All about Hiram's\r\njoining their church--what a good young man he was, how conscientious,\r\nhow devoted to business, and how rich, and getting richer every day.\r\n\r\nMiss Thorne drew herself up slightly, as if that could be of no\r\nconsequence to _her_. Still she unbent directly, and said with an\r\namiable smile, as if simply to continue the conversation, 'But Mr.\r\nMyrtle says he is a woman hater.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I think not so bad as that; but Mrs. Bennett says the ladies are\r\nall crazy about him, and he has a ridiculous suspicion that they are\r\nafter his money.'\r\n\r\n'The wretch!' exclaimed Miss Arabella, laughing.\r\n\r\n'So I say,' rejoined Mrs. Myrtle. 'But the fact is, Mrs. Bennett says\r\nthat Mr. Meeker thinks too much about business, and if he goes on in\r\nthis way he will never get married, and she tells him she is determined\r\nhe shall marry.'\r\n\r\n'A very proper resolve!' exclaimed Miss Thorne in the same vein.\r\n\r\nThe conversation now turned on other topics, and after a few minutes\r\nMiss Thorne took leave in no very enviable state of mind. Here was a\r\nyoung man about to become one of the stars of fashion, rich,\r\naccomplished, quite in her own set, too; yet not a step had he taken\r\ntoward securing her favor. Why, he might even outstrip her at St.\r\nJude's! Then what _would_ become of her? 'I wonder if he keeps Lent?'\r\nshe muttered between her clenched teeth, as she walked along.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment, who should she encounter but Miss Innis, a\r\ncharming, bewitching, and very fashionable young creature (so all the\r\ngentlemen said), to whom at the late parties, as I have already\r\nmentioned, Hiram had been devoted the larger part of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe ladies rushed toward each other and embraced in the most\r\naffectionate manner. The usual rapid chitchat ensued.\r\n\r\n'What do you think of our new beau?' asked Miss Innis.\r\n\r\nNow Miss Thorne was burning with envy, hatred, malice, and all\r\nuncharitableness toward the young and rising belle, which was greatly\r\nincreased by witnessing Hiram's extraordinary devotion to her. After the\r\nconversation with Mrs. Myrtle, she could no longer doubt the fact that\r\nhe was soon to become of decided importance in the fashionable world.\r\nThe moment she saw Miss Innis approaching, she anticipated some such\r\nquestion as was now put to her, and knowing that through her dear friend\r\nMrs. Bennett she could make Hiram's acquaintance at any time, she had\r\ndecided how to treat it.\r\n\r\nShe replied therefore with considerable animation, and as if she knew at\r\nonce to whom Miss Innis alluded: 'Oh, I think we shall make something of\r\nhim before the season is over. I tell Mrs. Bennett she must cure him of\r\nsome little provincialisms, however.'\r\n\r\n'Provincialisms!' exclaimed Miss Innis, who prided herself on her family\r\nand aristocratic breeding, though she had not wealth to boast of;\r\n'provincialisms! I confess I discovered none, and I certainly had a\r\npretty good opportunity for judging. He waltzes divinely, doesn't he?'\r\n\r\nThe tantalizing minx knew very well that Miss Thorne could only judge by\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n'He waltzes with much perfection, certainly,' replied Miss Thorne, with\r\nthe air of a connoisseur, 'but I think a little stiffly.'\r\n\r\n'Quite the reverse, I assure you. I never had a partner with whom it was\r\nso easy to waltz. He supports one so perfectly. I declare I am in love\r\nwith him already. Arabella dear, I give you warning I shall try my best\r\nto engross his attention the entire season.'\r\n\r\nShe laughed as she said this, and Miss Thorne laughed; then these young\r\nwomen of fashion again embraced, and with smiles and amiable expressions\r\nwent their way.\r\n\r\nHow suddenly the countenance of each then changed! That of Miss Innis\r\ngave unmistakable tokens of contempt and disgust, while Miss Thorne's\r\nface expressed a concentrated venom, which, if I had not myself often\r\nwitnessed, I would not believe is in the power of woman to display.\r\n\r\nThe rencontre with Miss Innis was so unendurable that Miss Thorne\r\nresolved to proceed at once to Mrs. Bennett's, where she could get\r\ndefinite information. Her pride was beginning to give way before her\r\njealousy of a rival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennett was at home, and welcomed her dear 'Arabella' with more\r\nthan usual cordiality. A long conversation ensued before Miss Thorne\r\ncould bring herself to broach the delicate subject. At last, and it had\r\nto be apropos of nothing, she said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, I declare, I forgot. Do you know I am angry with you? Yes, very,\r\nvery angry.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennett immediately put on the proper expression.\r\n\r\n'Tell me, quick, all about it,' she said. 'I will do penance if I have\r\ngiven you cause.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, you have given great cause. You have undertaken to bring out a\r\ngentleman, and your own cousin, too, without presenting him to me, and I\r\nmade up my mind never to speak to you again; but you see how I keep my\r\nresolution.'\r\n\r\n'Poor Mr. Meeker!' exclaimed Mrs. Bennett. 'He little thinks in what\r\ntrouble he has involved me.'\r\n\r\n'But what have you to say for _yourself_?' persisted Miss Thorne.\r\n\r\n'I declare, Arabella, I don't know what to say. Cousin Hiram is so odd\r\nand so obstinate on some points, although in most respects the best\r\ncreature in the world.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what can you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I can hardly explain what I do mean. In short, while Cousin Hiram asks\r\nmy advice in many matters, and, indeed, follows it; yet, where ladies\r\nare concerned, he is as obstinate as a mule.'\r\n\r\n'But what has that to do with your not presenting him?'\r\n\r\n'Well, since you must know,' hesitated Mrs. Bennett, 'he declined being\r\nintroduced to you.'\r\n\r\n'Declined!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'It is all through that hateful Mary Innis!' exclaimed Miss Thorne,\r\nreddening with rage. 'I know it. I am sure of it. Yes, I see through it\r\nall--all.'\r\n\r\n'I dare say,' returned Mrs. Bennett. 'I can't believe it either,' she\r\ncontinued. 'He is not so easily influenced. But, Arabella, my dear,\r\nthink no more of the matter. You will like Mr. Meeker, I know, when you\r\ndo meet, and all the more for any little obstacle at the beginning. I\r\nwas just thinking how I could bring you together. What do you say to\r\ndropping in at--no, that won't do. I have it; come round this very\r\nevening and take tea with us. Mr. Meeker is almost sure to come in. He\r\nhas not been here this week.'\r\n\r\n'Arabella' had her little objections.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, my darling. I am determined you two shall become acquainted\r\nbefore Mrs. Jones's party, and that is next Thursday. Don't forget how\r\nfond you are of waltzing, and there Cousin Hiram is superb.'\r\n\r\n'I know it,' said Miss Thorne, with a sigh. 'But won't it look strange?'\r\n\r\n'Look strange to do what you have done so often, my darling! Now,\r\nArabella, I won't take 'no' from you.'\r\n\r\n'I consent,' said Miss Thorne, languidly. 'He won't be rude to me, will\r\nhe?'\r\n\r\n'Rude! why, Arabella, what do you take him for?'\r\n\r\nThe ladies separated in great good humor.\r\n\r\nMiss Thorne, with a view to be revenged on Miss Innis, was determined to\r\nsecure our hero on any terms. She was at Mrs. Bennett's at the appointed\r\nhour. On this occasion her toilette was elaborately simple. She always\r\nexhibited, not only great taste, but great propriety, in dress. On this\r\noccasion one might readily suppose that, running in for a brief call,\r\nshe had been induced to prolong her stay.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock, who should arrive but Hiram! What a singular\r\ncoincidence!\r\n\r\nAn introduction followed.\r\n\r\nMiss Thorne was very natural. She appeared entirely at ease, receiving\r\nHiram with quiet cordiality, as if he were a member of the family.\r\n\r\nHiram, on his part, did not exhibit any of those disagreeable qualities\r\nfor which he received credit, but was apparently quite disarmed by the\r\ndomesticity of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe conversation became general, and all joined in it. After a while Mr.\r\nBennett withdrew to 'spend a half hour at the club,' assuring Miss\r\nThorne he would return in ample time to hand her to her carriage.\r\nPresently the servant called Mrs. Bennett, and hero and heroine were\r\nleft alone together.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward pause, which was first broken by Arabella, when the\r\nconversation ran on much in this way:\r\n\r\n'We are to have a very gay season, I believe.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed!'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you take a great interest in it?'\r\n\r\n'Quite the contrary. I take very little.'\r\n\r\n'Still, you seem to enjoy parties.'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes. When I go, the best thing I can do is to enjoy them.'\r\n\r\n'But you like to go, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'I can scarcely say I do--sometimes, perhaps.'\r\n\r\n'A person who waltzes as well as you do ought to like parties, I am\r\nsure.'\r\n\r\n'I feel very much flattered to have you praise my waltzing.'\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. It was again broken by Miss Thorne.\r\n\r\n'Do you know I think you so droll?'\r\n\r\n'Me! pray, what is there droll about me?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know. I can't tell. But you are droll--very droll.'\r\n\r\n'Really, I was not conscious of it.'\r\n\r\n'Were you aware that you occupy a seat directly in front of me in\r\nchurch?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly; that's not droll, is it?'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes; I think it is, rather. But that is not what I was going to\r\nsay. Will you answer me one question truly? It will seem strange for me\r\nto ask it,' simpered Arabella; 'but you must know your cousin Mrs.\r\nBennett and I are the dearest friends--the _very_ dearest friends; and\r\nmeeting you here, it seems different, and I am not so much afraid of\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nHiram sat with eyes wide open, in affected ignorance of what could\r\npossibly come next.\r\n\r\n'Now you put me out, indeed you do; I can never say what I was going to,\r\nin the world.'\r\n\r\n'_Do_,' said Hiram, gently.\r\n\r\n'Well, will you tell me why you refused to be introduced to me, and who\r\nit is that has so prejudiced you against me?'\r\n\r\n'No one, I assure you,' replied Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Then why did you decline the introduction? It is of no use to deny it;\r\nI know you _did_ decline it.'\r\n\r\n'I heard you were an heiress,' replied Hiram naively, 'and I don't like\r\nheiresses.'\r\n\r\n'Why not, pray?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, for various reasons. They are always such vain, stuck-up creatures.\r\nThen they are excessively requiring, and generally disagreeable.'\r\n\r\n'You saucy thing, you,' exclaimed Miss Thorne, but by no means in a\r\ndispleased tone.\r\n\r\n'Then why did you ask me? I must tell the truth. I confess I did not\r\nwant to make your acquaintance. Everybody was talking about Miss\r\nThorne--Miss Thorne--Miss Thorne. For my part, it made me detest you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you horrible creature,' said Arabella, now quite appeased.\r\n\r\n'I don't deny it,' continued Hiram, pleasantly. 'I repeat, I can't bear\r\nan heiress. I wouldn't marry one for the whole world.'\r\n\r\n'Why, pray?'\r\n\r\n'Because she would want her separate purse and separate property, and it\r\nwould be _her_ house, and _her_ horses and carriage, _her_ coachman, and\r\nso on. Oh no--nothing of that for me. I will be master of my own\r\nestablishment.'\r\n\r\n'What a savage you are! I declare it is as refreshing to hear you talk\r\nas it would be to visit a tribe of Indians.'\r\n\r\n'You are complimentary.'\r\n\r\n'You see I do you justice, though we are enemies. But tell me now that\r\nyou have been introduced to me, do I seem at all dangerous?'\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker's countenance changed from an expression of pleasant\r\nbadinage to one of sentimental interest, while he gazed abstractedly in\r\nthe young lady's face, without making any reply.\r\n\r\nArabella's heart beat violently, she scarce knew why.\r\n\r\n'You do not answer,' she said.\r\n\r\n'I cannot tell,' said Hiram, dreamily; then, starting, as if from a\r\nrevery, he said, in his former tone, 'Oh, your sex are all dangerous;\r\nonly there are degrees.'\r\n\r\n'I see you are not disposed to commit yourself. I will not urge you. But\r\ndo you think you will be afraid to waltz with me at the next party?'\r\n\r\n'It was the introduction I objected to, not the waltz.'\r\n\r\n'Then you consent?'\r\n\r\n'With your permission, gladly.'\r\n\r\n'The first waltz at the next party?'\r\n\r\n'The first waltz at the next party.'\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to detail the conversation which ensued, and which\r\nwas of a more general nature, referring to New York society, life _à la\r\nmode_, the reigning belles, then by an easy transition to Mr. Myrtle,\r\nand topics connected with St. Jude's. Soon they fell into quite a\r\nconfidential tone, as church subjects of mutual interest were discussed,\r\nso that, when Mrs. Bennett returned to the room, it seemed almost like\r\nan interruption.\r\n\r\n'I knew you two would like each other if you ever became acquainted,'\r\nsaid Mrs. Bennett, with animation.\r\n\r\n'Pray, how do you arrive at any such conclusion?' replied Miss Thorne,\r\nin a reserved tone, while she gave Hiram a glance which was intended to\r\nassure him she was merely assuming it.\r\n\r\n'Oh, never mind, my dear; it is not of so much consequence about your\r\nliking Hiram. You may detest him, if you please, but I am resolved he\r\nshall like you, for you are my pet, you know.'\r\n\r\nArabella looked affectionate, and Hiram laughed.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you may laugh as much as you please; men cannot understand our\r\nattachments for each other, can they, Arabella?'\r\n\r\n'No, indeed.'\r\n\r\n'That is true enough,' quoth Hiram.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Bennett came in, a handsome little supper was served. That\r\nconcluded, Hiram waited on Miss Thorne to her carriage.\r\n\r\n'I shall expect you to take back all the naughty things you have said\r\nabout me to your cousin,' she said, very sweetly, after she was seated.\r\n\r\n'About you, yes; but not about the _heiress_. But--but if you were not\r\none, I do think I should like you pretty well. As it is, the objection\r\nis insuperable; good night.'\r\n\r\nAway went carriage and horses and Arabella Thorne. Hiram stepped back\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\n'My wife says you have made a splendid hit to-night, Hiram,' remarked\r\nMr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n'Does she?' replied the other, in an absent tone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiram went late to Mrs. Jones's party.\r\n\r\nSo did Miss Thorne.\r\n\r\nIn a pleasant mood, Mrs. Bennett walked with her cousin to where the\r\nheiress was standing, and said, 'Miss Thorne, this is Mr. Meeker. I\r\nbelieve, however, you have met before.'\r\n\r\nThe waltzing had already commenced, and Hiram led his not unwilling\r\npartner to the floor, where they were soon giddily whirling, to the\r\nintense admiration of the lookers on.\r\n\r\nIt was now Hiram felt grateful to the unknown young lady who taught him\r\nhow to waltz _close_. He practised it on this occasion to perfection.\r\nArabella, by degrees, leaned more and more heavily. One arm resting\r\nfondly on his shoulder, she was drawn into immediate contact with\r\nHiram's _calculating_ heart. Round and round she sped--round and round\r\nsped Hiram, until the two were so blended that it was difficult to\r\ndecide who or what were revolving.\r\n\r\nAt last Arabella was forced to yield. Faintly she sighed, 'I must stop,'\r\nand Hiram, coming to a graceful termination, seated her in triumph--the\r\nmaster of the situation!\r\n\r\nMiss Innis looked on and smiled. Others expressed their admiration of\r\nthe performance. None could deny it was very perfect.\r\n\r\nSoon they were on the floor again, and again Arabella struggled hard for\r\nthe mastery. It was in vain. After repeated attempts to hold the field,\r\nshe was obliged to yield.\r\n\r\nHiram was too familiar with the sex to attempt to pursue his advantage.\r\nIndeed, Miss Arabella, having accomplished her object in showing Miss\r\nInnis that she _could_ monopolize Hiram if she chose, would have been\r\nquite ready to play the coquette and assume the dignified.\r\n\r\nHiram was prepared for this, and further was resolved not to expose\r\nhimself to any manifestation of her caprice. He perceived Miss Thorne\r\nwas disinclined to converse, and fancied she was preparing to be\r\nreserved. So he passed quietly into the next room, where he found Miss\r\nInnis quite ready to welcome him, though surrounded by a number of\r\ngentlemen. He claimed her for the next waltz by virtue of an engagement\r\nentered into at Mrs. Jones's. Soon the music commenced, and away they\r\nwent, responsive to its fascinating strains. Both waltzed admirably.\r\nThey entered with zest into the spirit of the scene and with that\r\nsympathy of motion which makes every step so easy and so enjoyable.\r\nThere was no rivalry, no holding out against the other. The pauses were\r\nnatural, not by either, but, as it were, by mutual understanding. Miss\r\nThorne was also on the floor with a very showy partner, doing her best\r\nto attract attention. She managed, as she swept by her rival,\r\n_accidentally_ to step on her dress in a very damaging manner. But Miss\r\nInnis was one of those natural creatures who are never discomfited by\r\nsuch an occurrence. She very quietly withdrew, and in about two minutes\r\nwas on the floor again.\r\n\r\n'It is well,' said Hiram to her in a low tone, 'that this happened to\r\nyou instead of Miss Thorne.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because she never could have appeared again the same evening.'\r\n\r\nMiss Innis smiled, and spoke of something else. The little hit did not\r\nseem in the least to gratify her.\r\n\r\nHiram noted this. 'Youth and beauty can well afford to be amiable, but\r\nit does not always happen that they are so,' he whispered.\r\n\r\nMiss Innis looked at him seriously, but made no reply; and the two took\r\nseats within the recess of a window.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Miss Thorne, having stopped waltzing, passed across the\r\nroom to the same vicinity, and stood talking with a gentleman, in a\r\nposition to command a view of the couple just seated. As Hiram raised\r\nhis eyes he encountered hers, for she was looking intently toward him.\r\nHe saw enough to be satisfied that his plans were working to perfection.\r\n\r\nWithout appearing to notice her presence, he continued the conversation\r\nwith his partner, and so engrossing did it become on both sides that\r\nneither seemed aware of the rapid flight of the hours. And it was only\r\nwhen Miss Innis perceived that the rooms were becoming thinned that she\r\nstarted up with an exclamation of surprise that it was so late.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker walked slowly homeward. He could not resist a certain\r\ninfluence from stealing over him.\r\n\r\n'Why is it,' he muttered to himself, 'that all the handsome girls are\r\nwithout money, and all the rich ones are ugly?'\r\n\r\nHe drew a long sigh, as if it were hard for him to give up such a lovely\r\ncreature. He soon reached his lodgings, and going to his room, he seated\r\nhimself before the fire, which burned cheerfully in the grate, and\r\nremained for a time completely lost in thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO Hiram Meeker, is it even now too late to obey some natural instincts?\r\nYou are well embarked in affairs, have already made money enough to\r\nsupport a wife pleasantly. Your business is daily increasing, your\r\nmercantile position for a young man remarkably well assured. Here is a\r\nreally lovely young girl--a little spoiled, it may be, by fashionable\r\nassociations, but amiable, intelligent, and true hearted. Probably you\r\nmight win her, for she seems to like you. The connection would give you\r\nposition, for you would marry into an old and most respectable family.\r\nTrue, you have conducted yourself shamefully toward Emma Tenant--to say\r\nnothing of Miss Burns. Let that pass. There is still opportunity to\r\nretrace. Attempt to win Miss Innis. If you do win her, what a happy home\r\nwill be yours! As for Miss Thorne--Hiram, you _know_ what she is. You\r\ndespise her in your heart. Besides, she is almost twenty-nine--you but\r\ntwenty-seven. Will her money compensate? O Hiram, stop--stop now, and\r\nthink!\r\n\r\nThis may have been the revery of Hiram Meeker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last he rose and prepared to retire. Doubtless he had made a final\r\nand irrevocable decision.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThere is good news for the Tenant family! The large commercial house in\r\nLondon whose failure dragged down Tenant & Co., had a branch at Rio.\r\nThis branch had been heavily drawn on, and suspended because the firm\r\nin London stopped. When affairs were investigated, it turned out that\r\nthe Rio branch was well aboveboard. The result was that the London house\r\nwas enabled to pay a composition of fifteen and sixpence in the pound.\r\nThis not only enabled Tenant & Co. to settle with their creditors, but\r\nplaced that old and respectable firm in a position to go on with their\r\nbusiness, though in a manner somewhat limited when compared with their\r\nformer operations. The whole commercial community rejoiced at this. Tho\r\nhouse had been so long established, and was conducted with so much\r\nintegrity, that to have it go down seemed a blow struck at the fair name\r\nand prosperity of the city. A committee appointed by the creditors had\r\ninvestigated everything connected with the failure, prior to hearing of\r\nthe news from Rio. This committee utterly refused to permit Mr. Tenant\r\nto put his house into the list of assets from which to pay the company's\r\ndebts. He insisted, but they were inexorable. This was highly gratifying\r\nto him, but he was not content. Now he could meet all on equal terms.\r\n\r\nWe must forgive Mrs. Tenant if she felt a very great degree of\r\nexultation at this result. The affair between Hiram Meeker and her\r\ndaughter had touched her so deeply (until Emma was away she did not feel\r\nhow deeply), that she could not but indulge her triumph that now, when\r\nshe encountered him, she was able to pass him with complete\r\nindifference. While her husband was crippled, she continued to feel\r\nscorn and contempt. Having regained her old position, she enjoyed a\r\nrepose of spirits and was no longer tantalized by recollection of the\r\nscenes of the last few months.\r\n\r\nEmma Tenant had a most charming European tour. She was absent a year.\r\nTwo or three months before her return, and while spending a few weeks\r\namong the Bernese Alps (I think Emma once told me it was at the Hotel\r\nReichenbach, near Meyringen), she encountered an old acquaintance, that\r\nis, an acquaintance of her childhood, in the person of young\r\nLawrence--Henry Lawrence--who was taking advantage of a business trip\r\nabroad to view the glory and the majesty of nature in the Oberland\r\nBernois.\r\n\r\nHowever much it may seem contrary to the theory of romantic young men\r\nand women, I am forced to state that notwithstanding her former love for\r\nHiram Meeker, Emma Tenant had not been six months in Europe before the\r\nwound might be considered healed. As her mind became enlarged by taking\r\nin the variety of scenes which were presented, scenes ever fresh and\r\nchanging, she was better enabled to judge how far such a person as Hiram\r\nMeeker could ultimately make her happy. Day by day she saw his character\r\nmore clearly and in a truer light, and could thus fully appreciate the\r\nnarrow escape she had from a life of wretchedness.\r\n\r\nBefore she encountered young Lawrence, she had become entirely\r\ndisenchanted. The former illusion was fully dispelled, and her heart\r\nleft quite free to be engrossed by a new interest.\r\n\r\nYoung ladies and gentlemen! Am I giving currency to theories which you\r\nare accustomed to consider heretical? I am but recording the simple\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the time Emma Tenant had reached New York the affianced of Henry\r\nLawrence (subject, of course, to her parents' approbation), Hiram Meeker\r\nwas engaged to--Miss Thorne.\r\n\r\nOnce decided on his course, Hiram pursued his object with the tenacity\r\nof a slow hound.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage of every weakness. He operated on her jealous nature\r\nso as to subject her to all the tortures which that spirit begets. By\r\nturns he flattered and browbeat her. He was sunny and amiable, or\r\ncrabbed and austere, as suited his purpose. In fact, he so played on\r\nthe poor girl, whose vanity and suspicion and jealous fear of a rival\r\nwere intense, that he made her life miserable. She was even thwarted in\r\nthe quarter where her strength principally lay. For Hiram treated her\r\nfortune as a mere nothing at all. If she, as had been her custom, headed\r\na subscription for some charity at St. Jude's, Hiram was sure to put\r\ndown his name for double the amount in close proximity to hers.\r\n\r\nAt last her spirit was completely broken by the persevering, unsparing,\r\nflattering, cajoling, remorseless Hiram. So she stopped quarrelling, and\r\nyielded. Then, how charming was our hero! Amiable, kind, desirous to\r\nplease, yet despotic to an extent: never yielding the power and\r\nascendency he had gained over her.\r\n\r\nThe great point now was to prevent any marriage settlement. Being\r\nmarried, since Miss Thorne's property was all 'personal,' he could at\r\nonce possess himself of it. Prior to the engagement, Hiram had often\r\nrepeated that he would many no woman who maintained a separate estate.\r\nAnd so much did he dwell on this that Miss Thorne was actually afraid to\r\nspeak to her solicitor on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the summer succeeding the gay season we have spoken of, Hiram Meeker\r\nand Arabella Thorne were united at St. Jude's by the Rev. Charles\r\nMyrtle, in presence of 'the most aristocratic and fashionable concourse\r\never assembled on such an occasion.' The Bennetts were present in great\r\nprofusion. Mrs. Myrtle, all smiles and tears, stood approvingly by. Mr.\r\nMyrtle, so all declared, never performed the ceremony so well before.\r\nMiss Innis had a conspicuous place in the proceedings, she being the\r\nfirst of the four bridesmaids who attended Arabella to the altar.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to explain her selection of one she had so feared\r\nand hated as a rival, nor Miss Innis's acceptance. But there she stood,\r\nvery beautiful, and apparently much interested in what was going on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter they had returned from their wedding tour, Hiram took possession\r\nof his wife's securities. His heart throbbed with excitement and his\r\neyes glistened as he looked them over.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett had fallen considerably short of the mark. Here were more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!\r\n\r\nJust then real estate had fallen to the extreme lowest point after the\r\ncollapse of the former high speculative prices. Hiram took immediate\r\nadvantage of this state of things. During the next three months he had\r\nsold out his wife's securities, and invested two hundred thousand\r\ndollars in vacant lots admirably situated in the upper part of the city.\r\nThe balance he put into his business.\r\n\r\nFrom that period it did not require a heavy discounting of the future to\r\nwrite Hiram Meeker a MILLIONAIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dead--dead--no matter, the skies are blue,\r\n    In their fathomless depths above,\r\n  And the glad Earth's robes are as bright in hue,\r\n  And worn with as regal a grace, and true,\r\n  As they were on the day they were woven new\r\n    By the hand of Infinite Love.\r\n\r\n  Hush! hush!--there is music out in the street,\r\n    A popular martial strain;\r\n  While the constant patter of countless feet\r\n  Keeps time to the strokes of the drum's quick beat,\r\n  And the echoing voices that mix and meet\r\n    Swell out in a glad refrain.\r\n\r\n  Lost--lost! Oh, why, when the earth is bright,\r\n    And soft is the zephyr's breath,\r\n  Oh! why, when the world is so full of light,\r\n  Should the wild heart, robed in a cloak of night,\r\n  Send up from frozen lips and white\r\n    A desolate cry of death?\r\n\r\n  Dead--dead! How wearily drag the days;\r\n    And wearily life runs on!\r\n  The skies look cold, through a misty haze,\r\n  That curdles the gold of the bright sun's rays,\r\n  And the dead leaves cover the banks and braes,\r\n    A shroud of the summer gone.\r\n\r\n  Last year--nay! nay! I do not complain;\r\n    There are graves in the heart of all;\r\n  So I do not murmur; 'twere weak and vain;\r\n  I accept in silence my share of pain,\r\n  And the clouds, with their fringes of crimson stain,\r\n    That over my young life fall.\r\n\r\n  There were beautiful days last year, I mind,\r\n    When the maple trees turned red,\r\n  They flew away like the sportive wind,\r\n  But I gathered the joys they left behind,\r\n  As I gather the leaves, but to-day I find\r\n    That the joys, like the leaves, _are dead_.\r\n\r\n  One year! It is past, and I stand _alone_,\r\n    Where I stood with another then;\r\n  'Tis well--I had scorned to have held _my own_\r\n  From the bloody strife, though my soul had known\r\n  That _his_ life would ebb ere the day was gone,\r\n    Amid thousands of nameless men.\r\n\r\n  _Nameless_, yet never a one less dear\r\n    Than the _dearest_ of all the dead;\r\n  I weep--but, Father, my bitter tear\r\n  Falleth not down o'er a _single_ bier--\r\n  I mourn not the joys of the lost last year,\r\n    But the rivers of bright blood shed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nReconstruction sounds the key note of American politics to-day. It is as\r\ntrue now as when Webster first said it, that 'the people of this\r\ncountry, by a vast and countless majority, are attached to the Union.'\r\nReconstruction is the hope of the Union; and the hope of the Union is\r\nthe controlling energy of the war. Hence, naturally, the theories that\r\nprevail in regard to reconstruction begin to define the political\r\nparties of the immediate future. United on the war, which they hold to\r\nbe not simply inevitable, but also a war in the combined interests of\r\nliberty and order, and, therefore, just, the people seem likely about to\r\nbe divided on questions suggested by the probably speedy termination of\r\nthe war. The Union one and indivisible is the fundamental maxim on which\r\nall such questions must be based. So long as the name of Washington is\r\nreverenced among them, the American people will accept no other basis of\r\nsettlement. The Union is to them the security and hope of all political\r\nblessings--liberty, justice, political order--which blessings it\r\ninsures. Disunion is revolution, and puts them in peril. Therefore, no\r\ntheory of reconstruction is practicable which countenances disunion, or\r\nin anywise assails the principle of the eternal oneness and\r\nindivisibility of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThere are three prominent theories of reconstruction now before the\r\npeople. The first, as being in the natural and constitutional order of\r\nthings, has shaped the policy of the Administration in its whole conduct\r\nof affairs. It supposes the rebellion to be an armed insurrection\r\nagainst the authority of the United States, usurping the functions and\r\npowers of various State Governments, and seeking to overthrow the\r\nNation. So considering it, the whole power of the Nation has been\r\nbrought to bear to subdue it, in accordance with the just authority\r\nconferred by the Constitution, which is the organic law of the Nation.\r\nThe steadfast prosecution of this policy, upheld and supported by the\r\npeople with a unanimity and patient faith that have strengthened the\r\ncause of democratic government all over the earth, has rescued from the\r\nrebellion and restored to their undisputed position in the Union, the\r\nStates of Kentucky, Missouri, and now, at last, Tennessee, with a\r\nportion of Virginia. Such are the results to the Union of the natural\r\nand constitutional policy that aims at reconstruction through\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\nThe two other theories spoken of may be best considered together, as\r\nthey originated in a common purpose, namely, the abolition of slavery,\r\nwhich it is supposed cannot be attained by the ordinary processes of war\r\nunder the Constitution. Their advocates, however, contend that they are\r\nstrictly constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe first of these theories supposes that the States included in the\r\nrebellion have, by the fact of rebellion, forfeited all rights as\r\nStates. It is argued that States, like individuals, forfeit their rights\r\nby rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe other theory supposes that the States having rebelled, may be dealt\r\nwith as foreign States; so that, according to the laws of war, the\r\nnation may treat them altogether as alien enemies, and in the event of\r\nthe Nation's triumph, the States will be in all respects like conquered\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that each of these theories ignores the principle of\r\nthe indivisibility of the Union, and presupposes a dismemberment of it\r\non the part of every rebellious State.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THEORY OF STATE SUICIDE.\r\n\r\nProbably no one will deny that rebellion works a forfeiture of all\r\npolitical rights to those engaged in it. The subject who renounces his\r\nallegiance can claim no protection: just as the Government that should\r\nfail to protect its subjects, could not claim their allegiance.\r\nAllegiance and protection are reciprocal and interdependent duties, and\r\nthe failure of one involves and works the failure of the other. So that\r\nit might be quite correct to declare, in reference to the Southern\r\nrebellion, that a rebel has no rights which the United States is bound\r\nto respect. It will be perceived that the question of _right_ is here\r\nspoken of, and not the question of _policy_. No feeling of sympathy with\r\na defeated people, not the thousand-fold natural ties that bind the\r\nNorth and the South, should blind our eyes to the main question of\r\nright. Any policy toward repentant rebels that is not magnanimous and\r\nhonorably befitting our complete triumph, can never find favor with the\r\nAmerican people, nor ought to; but the incalculably precious interests\r\nof the Nation will not admit of any uncertain precedents in regard to\r\nsecession. The precedent must be perfectly clear. It must be established\r\nunqualifiedly and unalterably that secession is treason, and that\r\nwhoever is concerned in it is a traitor and must expect a traitor's\r\npunishment. It has been common to call secession a political heresy. The\r\nrebellion, the fruit of secession, stamps it as more and worse than\r\nsimply a heresy. It is inchoate treason, and only awaits the favorable\r\nconditions to become open and flagrant. The patriotism, therefore, of\r\nany man may fairly be suspected, who, refusing to be taught by the\r\nexperience of this war, revealing these things as in the clear light of\r\nmidday, can speak softly and with 'bated breath' of secession. His\r\ncountry's baptism of fire has not regenerated such a man.\r\n\r\nThe attempt, as the legitimate and inevitable result of secession, to\r\noverthrow a Government whose burdens rested so lightly on its citizens\r\nas to have given rise to a current phrase that they were unfelt; and yet\r\nwhose magnificent power gave it rank among the first of nations,\r\nsecuring full protection to the humblest of its citizens, and causing\r\nthe name of American to be as proud a boast as Roman in the day of\r\nRome's power; and withal being the recognized refuge and hope of liberty\r\nand humanity all over the globe, as vindicating the right royalty of\r\nman;--the attempt to overthrow such a Government must stand forever as\r\nthe blackest of crimes. For the Confederate treason is more than treason\r\nagainst the United States: it is a crime against humanity, and a\r\nconspiracy in the interest of despotism, denying the royalty of man.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to our argument, a distinction is carefully to be noted\r\nbetween the consequences of rebellion to the individuals who engage in\r\nit and to the State which it assumes to control. It needs no argument to\r\nshow that rebellion against the supreme power of a State does not\r\nnecessarily affect the permanence of that power. If the rebellion fails,\r\nthe rightful authority resumes its functions. If the rebellion succeeds,\r\nthe movers of it assume the powers of the State, and succeed to all its\r\nfunctions. The civil wars of England furnish abundant illustration of\r\nthis principle. However the course of Government may for the time have\r\nbeen checked, and its whole machinery disarranged, the subsidence of the\r\ntumult left the state, in every case, as an organic whole, the same. The\r\nconsequences of unsuccessful rebellion fell only upon the persons\r\nengaged in it. So, in the successive changes that befell France after\r\nthe Revolution, the state, as the body politic, remained unchanged. In\r\ndealing with the question of rebellion in our country the same principle\r\napplies, only another element enters into the calculation. That element\r\nresults from the peculiar character of our Government in its twofold\r\nrelation to the people of State and Nation. The Government springs\r\ndirectly from the people, who have ordained separate functions for the\r\ntwo separate organisms, or bodies politic, the State and the Nation.\r\nStrictly considered, there are not two Governments, there is only one\r\nGovernment. Certain functions of it are ordained to be executed by the\r\nState, and certain other functions by the Nation, How, then, can the\r\nState, as such, assume to set aside the ordained functions of the\r\nNation? How, on the other hand, might the Nation assume to control the\r\nordained functions of the State? Each to its own master standeth or\r\nfalleth, and that master is the people. Hence, the absurdity of the\r\ndoctrine which claims the right of a State to resume powers once\r\ndelegated to the Nation. For the State, as such, never delegated those\r\npowers. Hence, the absurdity of secession as a dogma in American\r\npolitics. And hence, also, it equally appears how absurd is any claim on\r\nthe part of the Nation to visit upon the State organism the penalties of\r\nthe treason of individuals against itself.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that the State derives none of its rights from the\r\nNation. How, then, can it be said to forfeit its rights to the Nation?\r\nThe State is a separate and distinct organism, deriving its rights\r\ndirectly from the people within its territorial limit. They established\r\nit, and to them alone it is responsible. In the same manner, the people\r\nof the whole country, without regard to the territorial limits of\r\nStates, established the Nation. The people of the whole country,\r\ntherefore, have a permanent interest in the Nation, and no one portion\r\nof them may rightfully assume to set aside its supreme obligations, in\r\ndisregard and violation of the organic law. If certain of the people of\r\nany State have rebelled against the National Government, attempting thus\r\nto set aside its paramount obligations, undoubtedly their lives and\r\nproperty are forfeit to the Nation. But how can their individual treason\r\nwork a forfeiture of the State powers and functions? These have been\r\nusurped, indeed, by the armed combinations of the rebellion, but they\r\nare still complete, only awaiting the overthrow of the armed\r\ncombinations to be resumed and controlled by those persons within the\r\nsame territorial limit who have not rebelled.\r\n\r\nIt is objected to this view that it assumes a substratum of loyal people\r\nstill existing in the rebel States. The assumption is certainly\r\nwarrantable when we read of the scenes--witnesses against the Southern\r\nConfederacy whose eloquence surpasses speech--that have attended the\r\noverthrow of the rebellion in Tennessee; and when we remember that even\r\nin South Carolina there are such names as Judge Pettigrew and Governor\r\nAiken; and when in New York city alone there is to-day a large body of\r\nGeorgians, whose loyalty has made them exiles, and who only await the\r\nday of their State's deliverance to return and restore their State's\r\nloyalty; and when the signs in North Carolina are so positive that a\r\nUnion element yet survives there; and when even far-off Texas has her\r\nloyal exiles in our midst. Considering those 'signs of the times,' the\r\nassumption that there are loyal men in the rebellious States seems\r\ncertainly a valid and proper one, and one on which fairly to rest an\r\nargument. But it is believed that the argument is good without this\r\nassumption. Suppose that, the rebellion being overthrown, not even one\r\nman remains loyal to the Nation within the territorial limits of any\r\nsingle State, has the State ceased to exist? A State is called, in the\r\nlanguage of publicists, a body politic. It is, in effect, a sort of\r\ncorporation, administered for the benefit of its inhabitants by trustees\r\nwhom they appoint. One of the maxims of law is that a trust shall not\r\nfail for lack of a person to execute it. It might, therefore, in such a\r\ncase as the one supposed, be competent for the United States to\r\ndesignate persons who should take charge of the State Government, and\r\nadminister it in trust for the children of its former recreant\r\ninhabitants, and as their legal and political successors. Reverting to\r\nthe settled principles of the law, we find that the essential idea of a\r\ncorporation is its immortality, or individuality, or the perpetual\r\nsuccession of persons under it, notwithstanding the changes of the\r\nindividual persons who compose it. The State, like a corporation, has an\r\nindividuality of its own, which is not affected by the changes of the\r\nindividual persons composing it. It has an immortality, not affected by\r\ntheir entire extinction. Its own organic existence is not thereby\r\nextinguished. In other words, the State cannot be merged, or swallowed\r\nup, in the Nation.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that the doctrine of State suicide, as propounded in so\r\nmany words, by its author, in the original resolutions offered in\r\nCongress, is equally repugnant to the Constitution and good sense. It\r\nis, in effect, revolutionary; for it would dismember the Union, by\r\nstriking out of existence States as purely and completely sovereign\r\nwithin the sphere of their functions as the Nation itself. It is idle to\r\ndeny that it thus recognizes and gives support to the doctrine of\r\nsecession; for it accepts the results of secession, and supposes that\r\naccomplished by the rebellion which the war is meant to thwart and\r\nprevent, to wit, the disruption of the ties that bind the States and the\r\nNation together in one harmonious whole.\r\n\r\nWhat are we fighting for? To restore constitutional order; to vindicate\r\n'the sacredness of nationality.' In other words, to combat the principle\r\nof secession, by force and arms, in its last appeal, just as we have\r\nalways combated and opposed it hitherto on the platform and in the\r\nsenate. But what right have we to oppose secession by coercion? The\r\nright of self-preservation. For secession loosens the very corner-stone\r\nof our Government, so that the whole arch falls, breaking the Union into\r\nan infinity of wretched States. Admitting secession, our Constitution\r\nis, indeed, no stronger than 'a rope of sand.' We fight to maintain the\r\nConstitution as an Ordinance of Sovereignty (as it has been forcibly\r\nstyled) over the whole Nation. We must so maintain it, or surrender our\r\nnational existence. This being so, we cannot admit any such right as\r\nsecession; for that would be to sanction the revolutionary doctrine\r\nthat a body of men, usurping a State Government, and calling themselves\r\nthe State, can absolve their fellow citizens from their allegiance to\r\nthe Constitution, the supreme law of the land. The rebel States are,\r\nthen, still members of the Union. Otherwise, we are waging an unjust\r\nwar. Otherwise we falsify and contradict the record of our Revolution,\r\nand are striving to reduce to dependence a people who are equally\r\nstriving to maintain their independence. There is no justification for\r\nthis war save in the plea for the National Union; no warrant for it save\r\nin the preservation of the Constitution, which is the palladium and\r\nsafeguard of the Nation. The Southern rebellion has usurped the\r\nfunctions and powers of various State Governments: when it is\r\noverthrown, the victims of its usurpation will be restored to their\r\nformer rights. _Their_ allegiance is still perfect. Nothing but their\r\nown act can absolve them from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THEORY OF THE STATES AS ALIEN ENEMIES.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the theory that the rebel States are foreign enemies,\r\nand may be treated according to all the laws of war with foreign\r\nnations, seek support for their views in the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt rendered last March in the Hiawatha and other prize cases. The\r\nquestion was raised in those cases whether we had the right to\r\nconfiscate the property of persons resident in the rebel States who\r\nmight be non-combatants or loyal men. The Court decided that 'all\r\npersons residing within this territory (the rebellious region) whose\r\nproperty may be used to increase the revenues of the hostile power, are\r\n_in this contest_ liable to be treated as enemies, _though not\r\nforeigners_.' This decision defines the _status_ of persons in the\r\nrebellion region _bello flagranti_, or while the war lasts. It calls all\r\npersons within that region enemies, because their 'property may be used\r\nto increase the revenues of the hostile power.' Could their property be\r\nso used after the defeat of the rebellious power? The decision does not\r\nassume to determine that question. Nor could it come within the province\r\nof the Court to decide what might at some future time be the condition\r\nand _status_ of loyal men at the South.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in accordance with this decision all persons in the\r\nrebellious States are to be treated as alien enemies, and the deduction\r\nis hastily made that as to them all the Constitution, like any treaty,\r\nor compact, with foreign States, is, by the fact of rebellion, annulled.\r\nAside from the fact that the Constitution is not a compact, and when\r\nrightly understood cannot be confounded with a compact, such a\r\nconclusion is at war with that essential principle of our Government,\r\nwhich denies to any body of men the right to absolve their unwilling\r\nfellow citizens from their allegiance, that is, denies the right of\r\nsecession. Such citizens, whose will is overpowered by force, have never\r\nproved false to their fealty. The Constitution is still theirs; they are\r\nstill parties to it; and their rights are still sacred under it.\r\n\r\nThat no such conclusion is warranted by the decision above referred to,\r\nwill still further appear from the following considerations:--Our\r\ndealings with foreign nations are regulated by the principles of\r\ninternational law, and, according to that law, war abrogates all\r\ntreaties between belligerents, as of course. But international law\r\nsupposes the belligerents to be of equal and independent sovereignty.\r\nThis is the very point in dispute in our contest with the rebellion. We\r\ndeny to the rebellion the attribute of independent sovereignty, as we\r\ndeny it to every one of the States included in the rebellion. Our\r\nConstitution is, in no sense, a treaty between sovereign States. It is\r\nan organic law, establishing a nation, ordained by the people of the\r\nwhole country. Therefore, only such persons under it as voluntarily wage\r\nwar upon it, can be strictly called enemies: only such persons, on the\r\ndefeat of the rebellion, will be liable to be treated as enemies. As to\r\nall men who have not participated in the rebellion, it is not easy to\r\nsee how war, rebellion, usurpation, or any power on earth can destroy\r\ntheir rights under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THEORY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nReconstruction, then, must come, as the Union came, by the action of the\r\npeople within the territorial limits of each recreant State. That it\r\nwill so come is, in a manner, assured and made certain by the action of\r\nKentucky, Missouri, Virginia, and Tennessee. Surely, we cannot expect\r\nthe political action of an oppressed minority, in any one of the rebel\r\nStates, to anticipate the National forces sent for their deliverance.\r\nThe armed combinations in those States have overborne all opposition,\r\nand, during the past two years, have wielded the complete powers of a\r\nmilitary despotism. The Southern confederacy is a monstrous usurpation\r\nin each and every rebel State. The United States is intent on dethroning\r\nthat usurpation, for the purpose of restoring, to every man who asks it,\r\nthe rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution of his fathers; and for\r\nthe equal purpose of asserting its rightful powers as the National\r\nGovernment under the Constitution. The present Administration, then, has\r\ntaken the only course possible to be taken without open and flagrant\r\nviolation of the Constitution, which is the sole and sufficient warrant\r\nfor the war. For this course Abraham Lincoln is entitled to the\r\ngratitude of the people. His conscientious policy has been the salvation\r\nof the Republic, maintaining its integrity against armed rebellion, on\r\nthe one hand, and, on the other hand, saving it from destructives whose\r\nzeal in a noble cause has often blinded their minds to the higher claims\r\nof the Nation: in whose existence, nevertheless, that cause alone has\r\npromise of success.\r\n\r\nBut, it is asked, does not rebellion affect the institution of slavery?\r\nNot as a State institution, so far as the municipal law of any State is\r\nconcerned. That the slaves of rebels may properly be confiscated, as\r\nother property, seems not only reasonable and right, but also in\r\naccordance with well-settled decisions of the Supreme Court. Moreover,\r\nthe Constitution gives to Congress the power to prescribe the punishment\r\nof treason, and undoubtedly the Supreme Court will hold the Confiscation\r\nAct under that power to be constitutional and valid.\r\n\r\nBut does not the Emancipation Proclamation operate to confer freedom on\r\nall slaves within the rebel States? This question must likewise be\r\nbrought to the Supreme Court for adjudication. If the Proclamation can\r\nbe shown to have the qualities of a legislative act, doubtless it will\r\noperate as a statute of freedom to all slaves within the districts named\r\nin it. But it must be remembered that the Executive cannot make law. The\r\nProclamation, as an edict of the military commander, can only operate\r\nupon the condition of such slaves as are in a position to take advantage\r\nof its terms. As such military edict, therefore, it might be of no force\r\noutside of the actual military lines of the United States armies.\r\n\r\nBut the fact of freedom to many thousands of slaves by reason of this\r\nwar, and the inevitable speedy breaking down of the institution of\r\nslavery as one of the consequences to slaveholders of their mad folly,\r\nare beyond dispute, and assure us of the wise Providence of Him who\r\nmaketh even the wrath of man to praise Him, and the remainder of wrath\r\nHe will restrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and interesting results of that eclectic spirit\r\nwhich has brought into suggestive relations the different spheres of\r\nhuman knowledge and inquiry, is the application of geographical facts to\r\nhistorical interpretation. The comprehensive researches of Ritter and\r\nthe scientific expositions of Humboldt enable us to recognize the vast\r\ninfluence of local conditions upon social development, and to account\r\nfor the peculiar traits of special civilization by the distribution of\r\nland and water, and the agency of climate and position. In the calm\r\nretrospect of the present crisis of our national history, when the\r\nphilosopher takes the place of the partisan and the exciting incidents\r\nof the present are viewed in the chastened light of the past, it will be\r\nseen and felt that a kind of poetical justice and moral necessity made\r\nVirginia the scene of civil and physical strife. Of all the States, she\r\nrepresents, both in her annals and her resources, her scenery, and her\r\nsocial character, the average national characteristics: natives of each\r\nsection of the land find within her limits congenial facts of life and\r\nnature, of manners and industry: like her Southern sisters, she has\r\nknown all the consequences of slavery--but at certain times and places,\r\nfree labor has thriven; commerce and agriculture, the miner, the\r\nmariner, the tradesman, not less than the planter, found therein scope\r\nfor their respective vocations; the life of the sea coast, of the\r\nmountains, and of the interior valleys--the life of the East, West, and\r\nMiddle States was there reproduced in juxtaposition with that of the\r\nSouth. Nowhere in the land could the economist more distinctly trace the\r\ninfluence of free and slave labor upon local prosperity: nowhere has the\r\naristocratic element been more intimately in contact with the\r\ndemocratic. Her colonial record indicates a greater variety in the\r\noriginal population than any other province: she has given birth to more\r\neminent statesmen, has been the arena of more fierce conflicts of\r\nopinion, and is associated most directly with problems of government, of\r\nsociety, and of industrial experiment. On her soil were first landed\r\nAfrican captives; and when the curse thus entailed was dying out, it was\r\nrenewed and aggravated by the inducement to breed slaves for the cotton\r\nand sugar plantations. From Virginia flowed the earliest stream of\r\nimmigration to the West, whereby a new and mighty political element was\r\nadded to the Republic: there are some of the oldest local memorials of\r\nAmerican civilization: for a long period she chiefly represented\r\nSouthern life and manners to the North: placed between the extremes of\r\nclimate--producing the staples of all the States, except those bordering\r\non the Gulf--earlier colonized, prominent in legislation, fruitful in\r\neminent men, she was more visited by travellers, more written about,\r\nbetter known, and therefore gathered to and grafted upon herself more of\r\nthe rich and the reckless tendencies and traits of the country; and\r\nbecame thus a central point and a representative State--which destiny\r\nseems foreshadowed by her physical resources and her local situation.\r\nExcept New England, no portion of our country has been more fully and\r\nfaithfully illustrated as to its scenery, domestic life, and social\r\ntraits, by popular literature, than Virginia. The original affinity of\r\nher colonial life with the ancestral traditions of England, found apt\r\nexpression in Spenser's dedication of his peerless allegory to\r\nElizabeth, wherein the baptism of her remote territory, in honor of her\r\nvirginal fame, was recognized. The first purely literary work achieved\r\nwithin her borders was that of a classical scholar, foreshadowing the\r\nlong dependence of her educated men upon the university culture of Great\r\nBritain; and those once admired sketches of scenery and character which\r\ngave to William Wirt, in his youth, the prestige of an elegant writer,\r\nfound there both subjects and inspiration; while the American school of\r\neloquence traces its early germs to the bar and legislature of the Old\r\nDominion, where the Revolutionary appeals of Patrick Henry gave it a\r\nclassic fame. The most prolific and kindhearted of English novelists,\r\nwhen he had made himself a home among us and looked round for a\r\ndesirable theme on which to exercise his facile art, chose the\r\nSouthampton Massacre as the nucleus for a graphic story of family life\r\nand negro character. The 'Swallow Barn' of Kennedy is a genuine and\r\ngenial picture of that life in its peaceful and prosperous phase, which\r\nwill conserve the salient traits thereof for posterity, and already has\r\nacquired a fresh significance from the contrast its pleasing and naive\r\ndetails afford to the tragic and troublous times which have since almost\r\nobliterated the traces of all that is characteristic, secure, and\r\nserene. The physical resources and amenities of the State were recorded\r\nwith zest and intelligence by Jefferson before Clinton had performed a\r\nlike service for New York, or Flint for the West, or any of the numerous\r\nscholars and writers of the Eastern States for New England. The very\r\nfallacy whereon treason based her machinations and the process whereby\r\nthe poison of Secession was introduced into the nation's life-blood,\r\nfound exposition in the insidious fiction of a Virginian--Mr. George\r\nTucker--secretly printed years ago, and lately brought into renewed\r\nprominence by the rebellion. 'Our Cousin Veronica,' a graceful and\r\nauthentic family history, from the pen of an accomplished lady akin to\r\nthe people and familiar with their life, adds another vivid and\r\nsuggestive delineation thereof to the memorable illustrations by Wirt,\r\nKennedy, and James; while a score of young writers have, in verse and\r\nprose, made the early colonial and the modern plantation and waterplace\r\nlife of the Old Dominion, its historical romance and social and scenic\r\nfeatures, familiar and endeared; so that the annals and the aspects of\r\nno State in the Union are better known--even to the local peculiarities\r\nof life and language--to the general reader, than those of Virginia,\r\nfrom negro melody to picturesque landscape, from old manorial estates to\r\nfield sports, and from improvident households to heroic beauties; and\r\namong the freshest touches to the historical and social picture are\r\nthose bestowed by Irving in some of the most charming episodes of his\r\n'Life of Washington.'\r\n\r\nWhen the river on whose banks was destined to rise the capital of the\r\nState received the name of the English monarch in whose reign and under\r\nwhose auspices the first settlers emigrated, and the Capes of the\r\nChesapeake were baptized by Newport for his sons Charles and Henry, the\r\nstorm that washed him beyond his proposed goal revealed a land of\r\npromise, which thenceforth beguiled adventure and misfortune to its\r\nshores. Captain John Smith magnified the scene of his romantic escape\r\nfrom the savages: 'Heaven and earth,' he wrote, 'seemed never to have\r\nagreed better to frame a place for man's commodious and delightful\r\nhabitation.' To the wonderful reports of majestic forests, rare wild\r\nflowers, and strange creatures, such as the opossum, the hummingbird,\r\nthe flying squirrel, and the rattlesnake--to the pleasures of the chase,\r\nand the curious traits of aboriginal life--were soon added the\r\nattractions of civic immunities and possibilities--free trade, popular\r\nlegislative rule, and opportunities of profitable labor and social\r\nadvancement. Ere long, George Sandys, a highly educated employée of the\r\nGovernment, was translating Ovid on the banks of the James river;\r\nindustry changed the face of the land; a choice breed of horses, the\r\ntobacco culture, hunting, local politics, hospitality--churches after\r\nthe old English model, manor houses with lawns, bricks, and portraits\r\nsignificant of ancestral models, justified the pioneer's declaration\r\nthat Virginia 'was the poor man's best country in the world.' Beautiful,\r\nindeed, were the natural features of the country as described by the\r\nearly travellers; auspicious of the future of the people as it expanded\r\nto the eye of hope, when the colony became part of a great and free\r\nnation. Connected at the north and east, by thoroughfare and\r\nwatercourse, with the industrial and educated States of New England, the\r\nfertile and commercial resources of New York, and the rich coal lands\r\nand agricultural wealth of Pennsylvania; Maryland and the Atlantic\r\nproviding every facility to foreign trade, and the vast and then\r\npartially explored domains of Kentucky and Ohio inviting the already\r\nswelling tide of immigration, and their prolific valleys destined to be\r\nthe granary of the two hemispheres--all that surrounded Virginia seemed\r\nprophetic of growth and security within, the economist and the lover of\r\nnature found the most varied materials; with three hundred and\r\nfifty-five miles of extent, a breadth of one hundred and eighty-five,\r\nand a horizontal area of sixty-five thousand six hundred and twenty-four\r\nsquare miles--one district embracing the sea coast to the head of\r\ntidewater, another thence to the Blue Ridge, a third the valley region\r\nbetween the latter range and that of the Alleghanies, and a fourth the\r\ncounties beyond them--every kind of soil and site, from ocean margin to\r\nriver slope, from mountain to plain, are included within her limits:\r\nhere, the roads stained with oxides, indicative of mineral wealth;\r\nthere, the valleys plumed with grain and maize; the bays white with\r\nsails; the forest alive with game; lofty ridges, serene nooks, winding\r\nrivers, pine barrens, alluvial levels, sterile tracts, primeval\r\nwoods--every phase and form of natural resource and beauty to invite\r\nproductive labor, win domestic prosperity, and gratify the senses and\r\nthe soul. Rivers, whose names were already historical--the James, the\r\nYork, the Rappahannock, the Potomac, and the peaceful Shenandoah,\r\nflowing through its beautiful valley and connecting the base of the Blue\r\nRidge with the Potomac; Chesapeake bay, a hundred and ninety miles from\r\nits entrance through Maryland and Virginia, on the one side, and the\r\nRoanoke, finding an outlet in Albemarle sound, while the Kanawha and\r\nMonongahela, as tributaries of the Ohio, on the other, keep up that\r\ncommunication and natural highway which links, in a vast silver chain,\r\nthe separate political unities of the land. The hills ribbed with fine\r\nmarble and pierced by salubrious springs; picturesque natural bridges,\r\ncliffs, and caves, described with graphic zeal by Jefferson, and the\r\nwild and mysterious Dismal Swamp, sung by Moore; the tobacco of the\r\neastern counties, the hemp of lands above tidewater, the Indian corn,\r\nwheat, rye, red clover, barley, and oats, of the interior, and the fine\r\nbreeds of cattle and horses raised beyond the Alleghany--are noted by\r\nforeign and native writers, before and immediately after the Revolution,\r\nas characteristic local attractions and permanent economical resources;\r\nand with them glimpses of manorial elegance, hospitality, and\r\nculture--which long made the life and manners of the State one of the\r\nmost congenial social traditions of the New World.\r\n\r\nYet, as if prophetic of the long political issues of which she was\r\ndestined to be the scene of conflict, the colonial star of Virginia was\r\nearly obscured by misfortune. When John Smith left her shores for the\r\nlast time in 1609, discontent and disaster had already marred the\r\nprospects of the new settlement; and, in half a year, Gates, Somers,\r\nNewport arrived to find but sixty colonists remaining, and they resolved\r\nto abandon the enterprise; but on encountering Delaware, they were\r\ninduced to return, and Jamestown was again the scene of life and labor.\r\nTen years of comparative success ensued; and then one hundred and sixty\r\npoor women were imported for wives, at a cost of about the same number\r\nof pounds of tobacco; but simultaneously with this requisite provision\r\nfor domestic growth and comfort, the germ of Virginia's ruin came: a\r\nDutch vessel entered the James river, bringing twenty African captives,\r\nwhich were purchased by the colonists. Two years later the Indians made\r\na destructive foray upon the thriving village; the king became alarmed\r\nat the freedom of political discussion, dissolved the Virginia company,\r\nand appointed a governor and twelve councillors to rule the\r\nprovince;--the father's policy was followed by Charles the First, many\r\nof whose zealous partisans found a refuge from Cromwell in the province.\r\nAt last came the Revolution and the Union. Meantime slavery was dying\r\nout; its abolition was desired; and had free labor then and there\r\nsuperseded it, far different would have been the destiny of the fair\r\nState; whose western portion affords such a contrast to that wherein\r\nthis blight induced improvidence and deterioration, the tokens whereof\r\nwere noted by every visitor in the spare and desultory culture of the\r\nsoil, the neglected resources, the dilapidated fences and dwellings, and\r\nthe absence of that order and comfort which inevitably attaches to\r\nlegitimate industry and self-reliance. This melancholy perversion of\r\ngreat natural advantages was the result of slave breeding for the\r\nSouthern market. Otherwise Virginia would have continued the prosperous\r\ndevelopment initiated in her colonial days. The exigencies of the cotton\r\nculture, rendered immensely profitable by a mechanical invention which\r\ninfinitely lessened the cost of preparing the staple for the market, had\r\nthus renewed and prolonged the original and fast-decaying social and\r\npolitical bane of a region associated with the noblest names and most\r\nbenign prospects. Chief-Justice Marshall aptly described to an English\r\ntraveller this sad and fatal transition:\r\n\r\n     'He said he had seen Virginia the leading State for half his life;\r\n     he had seen her become the second, and sink to be the fifth. Worse\r\n     than this, there was no arresting her decline if her citizens did\r\n     not put an end to slavery; and he saw no signs of any intention to\r\n     do so, east of the mountains at least. He had seen whole groups of\r\n     estates, populous in his time, lapse into waste. He had seen\r\n     agriculture exchanged for human stock breeding; and he keenly felt\r\n     the degradation. The forest was returning over the fine old\r\n     estates, and the wild creatures which had not been seen for\r\n     generations were reappearing; numbers and wealth were declining,\r\n     and education and manners were degenerating. It would not have\r\n     surprised him to be told that on that soil would the main battles\r\n     be fought when the critical day should come which he foresaw.'\r\n\r\nThat day it is our lot to behold. Forced at the point of the bayonet to\r\narrogate to herself the illegal claims she had vainly sought to\r\nestablish by popular suffrage, as reserved rights, in 1787, and the\r\nresolutions of 1798, the Secession Ordinance was nominally passed and\r\nsummarily enforced, despite the protests of the citizens and the\r\nwithdrawal of the western counties; and thus the traitors of the Cotton\r\nStates made Virginia the battle field between slaveocracy and\r\nconstitutional government. As early as 1632 a fierce controversy for\r\nterritorial rights occurred on the Chesapeake, when that portion of\r\nVirginia, now Maryland, was brought into dispute by Claiborne, who began\r\nto trade, notwithstanding the grant which Lord Baltimore had secured:\r\nthis, the first conflict between the whites, and two Indian massacres,\r\nmade desolate the region so lately devastated by the civil war. Nor was\r\nthe original enjoyment of remarkable political rights coincident with\r\nAmerican independence; for, while Charles the Second was an exile, and\r\nParliament demoralized, the fugitive king still held nominal sway in\r\nVirginia; and when the flight of Richard Cromwell left the kingdom\r\nwithout a head, that distant colony was ruled by its own assembly, and\r\nenjoyed free suffrage and free trade: then came what is called Bacon's\r\nrebellion--an effective protest against oppressive prohibitions. Nor did\r\nthese civil discords end with the Restoration; many old soldiers of\r\nCromwell emigrated to Virginia, and, under their auspices, an\r\ninsurrection 'against the tobacco plot' was organized; and this was\r\nfollowed by numerous difficulties in home legislation, by violent\r\ncontroversies with royal governors; deputies continually were sent to\r\nEngland to remonstrate with the king against 'intolerable grants' and\r\nthe exportation of jailbirds. Their despotic master over the sea\r\nappropriated the lands of the colonists, while their own representatives\r\nmonopolized the profits; cruel or obstinate was the sway of Berkeley,\r\nSpottwood, Dinwiddie, and Dunmore; and after the people had succumbed as\r\nregards military opposition, they continued to maintain their rights by\r\nlegislative action. Under James the Second, Lord Howard repealed many of\r\nthese conservative acts and prorogued the House of Burgesses. A respite,\r\nattested by glad acclaim, marked the accession of William and Mary, and\r\nthe recall of Howard. Andros was sent over in 1692. The skirmish with\r\nJunonville initiated the French war and introduced upon the scene its\r\nmost hallowed name and character, when Colonel Washington appeared first\r\nas a soldier, strove in vain against the ignorance and self-will of\r\nDinwiddie, and shared Braddock's defeat, to be signally preserved for\r\nthe grandest career in history.\r\n\r\nAnd when the war of the Revolution gave birth to the nation, not only\r\nwas Virginia the native State of its peerless chief, but some of its\r\nmemorable scenes and heroes there found scope; Steuben and Lafayette\r\nthere carried on military operations, there the traitor Arnold was\r\nwounded, Hamilton and Rochambeau gained historic celebrity, and there\r\nthe great drama was closed by the surrender of Cornwallis. In the\r\ndebates incident to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, there was\r\nmanifested in Virginia that jealousy of a strong central government,\r\nwhich thwarted the wise advocacy and ignored the prophetic warnings of\r\nthe best statesmen, thereby confirming the fundamental error destined,\r\nyears after, to give facility to treasonable usurpation: the\r\nConstitution was only ratified, at last, by a majority of ten. In the\r\nwar of 1812, Hampton, Craney Island, White House, and various places on\r\nand near the Potomac, since identified with fierce encounters and forays\r\nin the war of the rebellion, witnessed gallant deeds in behalf of the\r\nRepublic. In 1829 a convention assembled in Virginia to modify the\r\nConstitution. Long having the most extensive territory and largest\r\nslaveholders, the aristocratic element disturbed and overmastered\r\ndemocratic principles. During Cromwell's rule, when virtually\r\nindependent, Virginia proffered a fleet to the fugitive monarch; who,\r\nwhen restored, in gratitude ordered her arms to be quartered with those\r\nof England, Scotland, and Ireland; in exile even accepted her invitation\r\nto migrate thither and assume the privileges of royalty: coins of the\r\nOld Dominion yet testify this projected despotism. Instead of Dissenters\r\nas in New England, Quakers as in Pennsylvania, or Romanists as in\r\nMaryland, Virginia, from her earliest colonization, was identified with\r\nthe Church of England. It was regarded, says one of her historians, as\r\nan 'unrighteous compulsion to maintain teachers; and what they called\r\nreligious errors were deeply felt during the regal government:' the\r\nchildren of the more prosperous colonists were sent to England to be\r\neducated; their pursuits and habits, on returning, were unfavorable to\r\nstudy; and, therefore, the advantage thus gained was, for the most part,\r\nconfined to 'superficial good manners,' and the ideal standard attained\r\nthat of 'true Britons and true churchmen;' the former was a more\r\ncherished distinction there than elsewhere in America. In 1837 was\r\ncopied from a tombstone in an old-settled part of the State, this\r\ninscription: 'Here lyes the body of Lieut. William Harris, who died May\r\nye 16, 1608--a good soldier, husband, and neighbor: _by birth a\r\nBriton_.' In these facts of the past and normal tendencies we find ample\r\nmeans and motives to account for the anomalous political elements\r\ninvolved in the history--social and civic--of Virginia. While boasting\r\nthe oldest university where four Presidents of the United States were\r\neducated, she sustained a slave code which was a bitter satire on\r\ncivilized society: the law of entail long prevailed in a community\r\nostensibly democratic, and only by the strenuous labors of Jefferson was\r\nchurch monopoly abolished. It is not surprising, in the retrospect, that\r\nher roll of famous citizens includes the noblest and the basest names\r\nwhich illustrate the political transitions of the land; the architects\r\nand subverters of free polity, the magnanimous and the perfidious. When\r\nthe ameliorating influence of time and truth had, in a degree,\r\nharmonized the incongruous elements of opinion and developed the\r\neconomical resources, while they liberalized the sentiments and\r\nhabitudes of the people; when, says Caines, 'slavery, by exhausting the\r\nsoil, had eaten away its own profits, and the recolonization by free\r\nsettlers had actually begun, came suddenly the prohibition of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, and nearly at the same time, the vast enlargement\r\nof the field for slavery, by the purchase of Louisiana; and these two\r\nevents made Virginia again profitable as a means of breeding for\r\nexportation and sale at the South.\r\n\r\nThe future geographer who elaborately applies the philosophy of that\r\nscience, as interpreted by its modern professors, to our own history,\r\nwill find in the events of the last few years in Virginia the richest\r\nand most impressive illustrations of local and physical causes in\r\ndetermining political and social destinies. Between the eastern and\r\nwestern portion of that State it will be demonstrated that nature placed\r\nirreconcilable barriers to the supremacy of slave labor and slave\r\nproperty; and the economical value of each will be shown thus and there\r\ntested with emphatic truth; so that by the laws of physical geography\r\nthe first effect of an appeal to arms to maintain the one, was to\r\nalienate, as a civic element, the other, and give birth to a new State,\r\nby virtue of the self assertion incident to the violation of a normal\r\ninstinct and necessity of civilization.\r\n\r\nWhat a change came over the scene when the grave civic interests so long\r\nand recklessly involved in the conflict of opinion were submitted to the\r\narbitrament of battle! Along the river on whose shores the ashes of\r\nWashington had slept for more than half a century in honored security,\r\nbatteries thundered upon each passing craft that bore the flag of the\r\nnation: every wood became a slaughter pen, every bluff a shrine of\r\npatriotic martyrdom; bridges were destroyed and rebuilt with alacrity;\r\nthe sentinel's challenge broke the stillness of midnight; the earth was\r\nhoneycombed with riflepits; campfires glowed on the hills; thousands\r\nperished in the marshes; creeks were stained with human blood; here sank\r\nthe trench; there rose a grave mound or a fortress; pickets challenged\r\nthe wanderer; every ford and mountain pass witnessed the clash of arms\r\nand echoed with the roar of artillery; the raid, the skirmish, the\r\nbivouac, the march, and the battery successively spread desolation and\r\ndeath; Arlington House, full of peaceful trophies, once dear to national\r\npride, was the headquarters of an army; balloons hung in the sky, whence\r\nthe movements of the foe were watched. Gaps and junctions were contested\r\nunto death; obscure towns gained historic names and bloody memories; and\r\neach familiar court-house and village came to be identified with\r\nvalorous achievements or sanguinary disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd this land of promise, this region which so long witnessed the\r\nextremes of political magnanimity and turpitude, this arena where the\r\nvital question of labor, as modified by involuntary servitude, and free\r\nactivity, found its most practical solution--was, and is, legitimately,\r\nappropriately, and naturally, the scene of the fiercest strife for\r\nnational existence--where the claims and the climax of freedom and faith\r\nculminated in all the desolation of civil war. A more difficult country\r\nfor military operations can scarcely be imagined. Early in the struggle\r\nit was truly said:\r\n\r\n     'Virginia is the Switzerland of the continent--a battle field every\r\n     three miles--a range of hills streaming where Hill may retire five\r\n     miles by five miles till he reaches Richmond--a conquest,\r\n     undoubtedly, if the North perseveres, but won at such a cost and\r\n     with such time as to prolong unnecessarily the struggle. The\r\n     Richmond of the South lies in the two millions of blacks that are\r\n     within the reach of cannon of our gunboats in the rivers that empty\r\n     into the Gulf.'\r\n\r\nHow wearisome the delays and how constant the privations of the army of\r\noccupation in such a region, wrote an experienced observer:\r\n\r\n     'Dwelling in huts, surrounded by a sea of mud, may appear to be\r\n     very romantic--on paper--to some folks, but the romance of this\r\n     kind of existence with the soldiers soon wears away, and to them\r\n     any change must necessarily be for the better; they therefore hail\r\n     with delight, as a positive relief, the opportunity once more to\r\n     practise their drill which the recent change of weather has\r\n     afforded them. For the last three months, the time of the soldier\r\n     has passed heavily enough, with the long winter nights, and little\r\n     else to relieve the monotony of his life but stereotyped guard\r\n     duty.'\r\n\r\nIt would require volumes to describe the ravages of war in Virginia: let\r\na few pictures, selected from sketches made on the spot, indicate the\r\nmelancholy aspect of a domain, a few weeks or months before smiling in\r\npeace and productiveness. The following facetious but faithful\r\nstatement, though confined to a special, applies to many districts:\r\n\r\n     'The once neat court-house stands by the roadside a monument to\r\n     treason and rebellion, deprived of its white picket fence, stripped\r\n     of window blinds, cases, and dome, walls defaced by various\r\n     hieroglyphics, the judge's bench a target for the 'expectorating'\r\n     Yankee;' the circular enclosure occupied by the jury was besmeared\r\n     with mud, and valuable documents, of every description, scattered\r\n     about the floor and yard--it is, indeed, a sad picture of what an\r\n     infatuated people will bring upon themselves. In one corner of the\r\n     yard stands a house of records, in which were deposited all the\r\n     important deeds and papers pertaining to this section for a\r\n     generation past. When our advance entered the building, they were\r\n     found lying about the floor to the depth of fifteen inches or more\r\n     around the doorsteps and in the dooryard. It is impossible to\r\n     estimate the inconvenience and losses which will be incurred by\r\n     this wholesale destruction of deeds, claims, mortgages, etc. I\r\n     learned that a squadron of exasperated cavalry, who passed this way\r\n     not long since, committed the mischief. The jail across the way,\r\n     where many a poor fugitive has doubtless been imprisoned for\r\n     striking out for freedom, is now used as a guardhouse. As I write,\r\n     the bilious countenance of a culprit is peeping through the iron\r\n     grates of a window, who, may be, is atoning for having invaded a\r\n     henroost or bagged an unsuspecting pig. Our soldiers have rendered\r\n     animal life almost extinct in this part of the Old Dominion.\r\n     Indeed, wherever the army goes, there can be heard on every side\r\n     the piercing wail of expiring pork, the plaintive lowing of a\r\n     stricken bovine, or suppressed cry of an unfortunate gallinacious.'\r\n\r\nHere is a scene familiar to many a Union soldier who gazed at sunset\r\nupon the vast encampment:\r\n\r\n     'Along the horizon a broad belt of richest amber spread far away\r\n     toward north and south; and above, the spent, ragged rain clouds of\r\n     deep purple, suffused with crimson, were woven and braided with\r\n     pure gold. Slowly from the face of the heavens they melted and\r\n     passed away as darkness came on, leaving the clear sky studded with\r\n     stars, and the crescent moon shedding a soft radiance below. I\r\n     climbed to the top of a hill not far off, and looked across the\r\n     country. On every eminence, in every little hollow almost, were\r\n     innumerable lights shining, some thick and countless as stars,\r\n     indicating an encampment; others isolated upon the outskirts; here\r\n     and there the glowing furnace of a bakery; the whole land as far as\r\n     the eye could see looking like another heaven wherein some\r\n     ambitious archangel, covetous of creative power, had attempted to\r\n     rival the celestial splendors of the one above us. There was no\r\n     sound of drum or fife or bugle; the sweet notes of the 'good-night'\r\n     call had floated into space and silence a half hour before; only on\r\n     the still air were heard the voices of a hand of negroes chanting\r\n     solemnly and slowly, to a familiar sacred tune, the words of some\r\n     pious psalm.'\r\n\r\nWe may realize the effect of the armed occupation upon economical and\r\nsocial life by a few facts noted after a successful raid:\r\n\r\n     'In the counties visited there were but few rebels found at home,\r\n     except the very old and the very young. In nine days' travel I did\r\n     not see fifty able-bodied men who were not in some way connected\r\n     with the army. Nearly every branch of business is at a standstill.\r\n     The shelves in stores are almost everywhere empty; the shop of the\r\n     artisan is abandoned and in ruins. The people who are to be seen\r\n     passively submit to all that emanates from Richmond without a\r\n     murmur; they are for the most part simple minded, and ignorant of\r\n     all that is transpiring in the great theatre about them. An\r\n     intelligent-looking man in Columbia laughed heartily when told that\r\n     Union troops occupied New Orleans--Jefferson Davis would let them\r\n     know it were such the fact; and I could not find a man who would\r\n     admit that the Confederates had ever been beaten in a single\r\n     engagement. These people do not even read the Richmond papers, and\r\n     about all the information they do obtain is what is passed about in\r\n     the primitive style, from mouth to mouth. Before this raid they\r\n     believed that the Union soldiers were anything but civilized\r\n     beings, and were stricken with terror when their approach was\r\n     heralded. Of six churches seen in one day, in only one had there\r\n     been religious services held within six months. One half at least\r\n     of the dwelling houses are unoccupied, and fast going to decay.'\r\n\r\nNot all the land is ill adapted to cool actions and strategy; there are\r\nsections naturally fortified, and these have been the scenes of military\r\nvicissitudes memorable, extreme, picturesque, and fatal. Here is an\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n     'There is no town in the United States which exhibits more\r\n     deplorably the ravages of war than Harper's Ferry. More than half\r\n     the buildings are in ruins, and those now inhabited are occupied by\r\n     small dealers and peddlers, who follow troops, and sell at\r\n     exorbitant prices, tarts and tinware, cakes and crockery, pipes and\r\n     poultry, shoes and shirts, soap and sardines. The location is one\r\n     of peculiar beauty. The Potomac receives the Shenandoah at this\r\n     point; each stream flowing through its own deep, wild, winding\r\n     valley, until it washes the base of the promontory, on the sides\r\n     and summit of which are scattered the houses and ruins of the town.\r\n     The rapids of the rivers prevent navigation, and make the fords\r\n     hazardous. The piers of an iron bridge and a single section still\r\n     remaining, indicate a once beautiful structure; and a pontoon\r\n     substitute shows the presence of troops. An occasional canal boat\r\n     suggests a still continued effort at traffic, and transport\r\n     railcars prove action in the quartermaster's department. The\r\n     mountains are 'high and hard to climb.' The jagged sides of slate\r\n     rock rise vertically, in many places to lofty heights, inducing the\r\n     sensation of fear lest they should fall, while riding along the\r\n     road which winds under the threatening cliffs. The mountains are\r\n     crowned with batteries, 'like diadems across the brow,' and the\r\n     Hottentoty-Sibley tents dot the ridges like miniature anthills.'\r\n\r\nBut within and around the capital of Virginia cluster the extreme\r\nassociations of her history: these memories and memorials of patriotism\r\nhallow the soil whereon the chief traitors inaugurated their infamous\r\nrule; the trial of Burr and the burning of the theatre are social\r\ntraditions which make Richmond a name fraught with tragic and political\r\ninterest; her social and forensic annals are illustrious; and,\r\nhereafter, among the many anomalies of the nation's history, few will\r\nmore impress the thoughtful reminiscent than that a city eminent for\r\nsocial refinement and long the honored resort of the most eminent\r\nAmerican statesmen and jurists, the seat of elegant hospitality and the\r\nshrine of national fame, was, for years, desecrated by the foulest\r\nprisons, filled with brave American citizens, who were subjected to\r\ninsults and privations such as only barbarians could inflict, for no\r\ncause but the gallant defence of the national honor and authority\r\nagainst a slaveholders' rebellion.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps no coincidence is more impressive in the late experience of\r\na Union soldier in Virginia than the associations then and there\r\nawakened by the recurrence of the anniversary of the birth of her\r\nnoblest son and our matchless patriot:\r\n\r\n     'The 22d of February, 1863--the anniversary of Washington's\r\n     birthday--will long be remembered,' writes one, 'by the Army of the\r\n     Potomac. Encamped, as it is, on the very spot where he--'whom God\r\n     made childless that a nation might call him father'--passed most of\r\n     his youthful days, the thoughts of all naturally revert to the\r\n     history of that great man, and particularly to that part of his\r\n     early life, when, within the sacred precincts of home, a mother's\r\n     care laid the foundation of that high moral character which in\r\n     after life gave tone to both his civil and military career. Within\r\n     one mile of the spot where I am now writing these lines, George\r\n     Washington lived from the fourth to the sixteenth year of his age.\r\n     The river, the hills, and dales, now so familiar to the soldiers\r\n     composing this army, were the same then as to-day, and were the\r\n     scene of his early gambols, his youthful joys and sorrows. Over\r\n     these hills he wandered in the manly pursuits for which he was at\r\n     that early period distinguished above his fellows, and which\r\n     prepared him for enduring the hardships of the position he was\r\n     destined to fill; here, too, is where tradition says he\r\n     accomplished the feat of throwing a stone across the Rappahannock,\r\n     and here, too, stood the traditional cherry tree, about the\r\n     destruction of which with his little hatchet he would not utter a\r\n     falsehood. Yonder, just across the Rappahannock, in a small,\r\n     unostentatious burying ground, the immortal remains of 'Mary,\r\n     mother of Washington,' were buried--sacred spot, now desecrated by\r\n     the presence of the enemies of those principles which her honored\r\n     son spent the energies of his life to establish for the benefit of\r\n     all mankind. When we think for what Washington took up arms against\r\n     the mother country, and what, by his example and teachings, he\r\n     sought to perpetuate forever, and see the fratricidal hand raised\r\n     to destroy the fair fabric he helped to rear, we feel something as\r\n     though an omnipotent power would here intervene, and here on this\r\n     sacred spot overthrow the enemies of this land without the further\r\n     sacrifice of blood.'\r\n\r\nQuite a different and more recent local association is thus recorded:\r\n\r\n     'The second time that I stood here was nigh three years ago, when I\r\n     spoke to you in relation to John Brown, then in a Virginia jail.\r\n     How great the result of that idea which he pressed upon the\r\n     country! Do you know with what poetic justice Providence treats\r\n     that very town where he lay in jail when I spoke to you before? The\r\n     very man who went down from Philadelphia to bring his body back to\r\n     his sad relatives--insulted every mile of the road, his life\r\n     threatened, the bullets whistling around his head--that very man,\r\n     for eight or ten months, is brigadier-general in command of the\r\n     town of Charlestown and Harper's Ferry. By order of his superior\r\n     officers, he had the satisfaction of finding it his duty, with his\r\n     own right hand, to put the torch to that very hotel into which he\r\n     had been followed with insult and contumely, as the friend of John\r\n     Brown; and when his brigade was under orders to destroy all the\r\n     buildings of that neighborhood, with reverential care he bade the\r\n     soldiers stop to spare that engine house that once sheltered the\r\n     old hero. I do not know any history more perfectly poetic than of\r\n     that single local instance given us in three short years. Hector\r\n     Tindale, the friend of John Brown, who went there almost with his\r\n     life in his right hand, commands, and his will is law, his sword is\r\n     the guarantee of peace, and by his order the town is destroyed,\r\n     with the single exception of that hall which John Brown's presence\r\n     has rendered immortal.'\r\n\r\nThe graphic details furnished by the army correspondents to the daily\r\npress of the North, reveal to us in vivid and authentic terms the change\r\nwhich war has wrought in Virginia. The condition of one 'fine old\r\nmansion' is that of hundreds. On the banks of the Rappahannock and in\r\nthe vicinity of Fredericksburg is, for instance, an estate, now called\r\nthe Lacy House, the royal grant whereof is dated 1690. The bricks and\r\nthe mason work of the main edifice are English; the situation is\r\nbeautiful; the furniture, conservatories, musical instruments, every\r\ntrait and resource suggest luxury. After the battle of Fredericksburg,\r\nthe Lacy House became a hospital: and a spectator of the scene thus\r\ndescribes it:\r\n\r\n     'The parlors, where so often had the fairest and brightest of\r\n     Virginia's daughters, and her bravest and most chivalric sons, met\r\n     to enjoy the hospitalities of the liberal host, and to join in the\r\n     mazy dance 'from eve till rosy morn'--the dining room, where so\r\n     many lordly feasts had been served--the drawing room, wherein the\r\n     smiling host and hostess had received so many a welcome guest--the\r\n     bed rooms, from the bridal chamber where the eldest scion of the\r\n     house had first clasped in his arms the wife of his bosom, to the\r\n     low attic where the black cook retired after her greasy labors of\r\n     the day, all were closely crowded with the low iron hospital beds.\r\n     These halls, which had so often reëchoed the sound of music, and of\r\n     gayest voices, and also of those lower but more sacred tones that\r\n     belong to lovers, now resounded with shrieks of pain, and with the\r\n     lower, weaker groans of dying men.\r\n\r\n     'The splendid furniture was put to strange uses--the sideboard of\r\n     solid rosewood, made in those honest days before cabinet makers had\r\n     learned the rogue's trick of veneering, instead of being crowded\r\n     with generous wines, or with good spirits that had mellowed for\r\n     years in the cellars, was now crowded in every shelf with\r\n     forbidding-looking bottles of black draughts, with packages of salt\r\n     and senna, and with ill-omened piles of raking pills, perhaps not\r\n     less destructive in their way than shot and shell of a more\r\n     explosive sort. The butler's pantry and store rooms had their\r\n     shelves and drawers and boxes filled, not with jellies and\r\n     marmalades and preserves, and boxes of lemons and preserved ginger\r\n     and drums of figs, and all sorts of original packages of all sorts\r\n     of things toothsome and satisfying to the palate--but even her\r\n     scammony and gamboge, and aloes and Epsom salts, and other dire\r\n     weapons, only wielded by the medical profession, had obtained\r\n     exclusive sway.\r\n\r\n     'On many a retired shelf, and in many an odd corner, too, I saw\r\n     neglected cartridge boxes, cast-off belts, discarded caps, etc.,\r\n     which told, not of the careless and heedless soldier, who had lost\r\n     his accoutrements, but of the _dead_ soldier, who had gone to a\r\n     land where it is to be hoped he will have no further use for Minié\r\n     rifle balls or pipe-clayed crossbelts. I saw, too, with these other\r\n     laid-aside trappings, dozens and hundreds of Minié and other\r\n     cartridges, never now to be fired at an enemy by the hand that had\r\n     placed them in the now discarded cartridge box.\r\n\r\n     'The walls of the various rooms of the Lacy House, like those of\r\n     most of the old houses in Virginia, are ceiled up to the top with\r\n     wood, which is painted white. There is a heavy cornice in each\r\n     room; there are the huge old-fashioned fireplaces, the marble\r\n     mantelpieces over the same, and in the main dining room, where it\r\n     was the custom for the men to remain after dinner, and after the\r\n     ladies had retired, was a curious feature to be observed, that I\r\n     have never seen but once or twice. Over the marble mantel, but\r\n     quite within reach, runs a mahogany framework intended for the\r\n     reception of the toddy glasses, after the various guests shall have\r\n     finished the generous liquor therein contained.\r\n\r\n     'There are still some vestiges of the family furniture\r\n     remaining--some rosewood and mahogany sideboards, tables,\r\n     bedsteads, etc., which the family have not been able to remove, and\r\n     which the occupying soldiers have found no use for. The most\r\n     notable of these articles is a musical instrument, which may be\r\n     described as a compound harp-organ. It is, in fact, an upright\r\n     harp, played by keys which strike the wires by a pianoforte action,\r\n     which has an ordinary piano keyboard. This is, in fact, the\r\n     earliest form of the modern pianoforte. Then, in the same\r\n     instrument is an organ bellows and pipes, the music from which is\r\n     evoked by means of a separate keyboard, the bellows is worked by a\r\n     foot treadle, like that most detestable abomination known to\r\n     moderns as a melodeon. Thus, in the same instrument, the performer\r\n     is supposed to get the powers and effect both of an upright piano\r\n     and a small organ. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that\r\n     this instrument (which, doubtless, originally cost at least $3,000)\r\n     is now utterly useless, the wires, many of them, being broken, and\r\n     the whole machine being every way out of order. The maker's name is\r\n     set down as 'Longman & Broderup, 26 Cheapside, No. 13 Haymarket,\r\n     London.' The poor old thing has doubtless been in the Lacy House\r\n     for more than a hundred years. It has been rudely dragged from its\r\n     former place of honor, and now stands in the middle of the floor.\r\n     The spot it formerly occupied has been lately filled by a hospital\r\n     bed, on which a capital operation was performed. The spouting blood\r\n     from the bleeding arteries of some poor patient has covered the\r\n     wall with crimson marks. In fact, everywhere all over the house,\r\n     every wall and floor is saturated with blood, and the whole house,\r\n     from an elegant gentleman's residence, seems to have been suddenly\r\n     transformed into a butcher's shamble. The old clock has stopped;\r\n     the child's rocking horse is rotting away in a disused balcony; the\r\n     costly exotics in the garden are destroyed, or perhaps the hardiest\r\n     are now used for horse posts. All that was elegant is wretched; all\r\n     that was noble is shabby; all that once told of civilized elegance\r\n     now speaks of ruthless barbarism.'\r\n\r\nTake another illustration--that of the incongruous juxtaposition of old\r\nfamily sepulchres and fresh soldiers' graves--the associations of the\r\npast and the sad memorials of recent strife even among the dead:\r\n\r\n     'Yesterday,' writes a thoughtful observer, from near Stafford Court\r\n     House, in December, 1862, 'for the first time since leaving\r\n     Harper's Ferry, I met with an evidence of the old-time aristocracy,\r\n     of which the present race of Virginians boast so much and possess\r\n     so little. About four miles from here, standing remote and alone in\r\n     the centre of a dense wood, I found an antiquated house of worship,\r\n     reminding one of the old heathen temples hidden in the recesses of\r\n     some deep forest, whither the followers after unknown gods were\r\n     wont to repair for worship or to consult the oracles. On every side\r\n     are seen venerable trees overtowering its not unpretentious\r\n     steeple. The structure is built of brick (probably brought from\r\n     England), in the form of a cross, semi-gothic, with entrances on\r\n     three sides, and was erected in the year 1794. On entering, the\r\n     first object which attracted my attention was the variously carved\r\n     pulpit, about twenty-five feet from the floor, with a winding\r\n     staircase leading to it. Beneath were the seats for the attendants,\r\n     who, in accordance with the customs of the old English Episcopacy,\r\n     waited upon the dominie. The floor is of stone, a large cross of\r\n     granite lying in the centre, where the broad aisles intersect. To\r\n     to the left of this is a square enclosure for the vestrymen, whose\r\n     names are written on the north side of the building. The reader, if\r\n     acquainted with Virginia pedigrees, will recognize in them some of\r\n     the oldest and most honorable names of the State--Thomas Fitzhugh,\r\n     John Lee, Peter Hedgman, Moot Doniphan, John Mercer, Henry Tyler,\r\n     William Mountjoy, John Fitzhugh, John Peyton. On the north hall are\r\n     four large tablets containing Scriptural quotations. Directly\r\n     beneath is a broad flagstone, on which is engraved with letters of\r\n     gold, 'In memory of the House of Moncure.' This smacks of royalty.\r\n     Parallel to it lies a tombstone with the following inscription:\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Sacred to the memory of William Robison, the fourth son of H. and\r\n     E. Moncure, of Windsor Forest, born the 27th of January, 1806, and\r\n     died 13th of April, 1828, of a pulmonary disease, brought on by\r\n     exposure to the cold climate of Philadelphia, where he had gone to\r\n     prepare himself for the practice of medicine. Possessed of a mind\r\n     strong and vigorous, and of a firmness of spirit a stranger to\r\n     fear, he died manifesting that nobleness of soul which\r\n     characterized him while living, the brightest promise of his\r\n     parents, and the fondest hopes of their afflicted family.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     'Led, doubtless, by the expectation of discovering buried\r\n     valuables, some one has removed the stone from its original\r\n     position, and excavated the earth beneath. Close by the entrance on\r\n     the north side are three enclosed graves, where sleep those of\r\n     another generation. The brown, moss-covered tombstones appear in\r\n     strong contrast to a plain pine board at the head of a fresh-made\r\n     grave alongside, and bearing the following inscription: 'Henry\r\n     Basler, Company H, One Hundred and Eighteenth Pennsylvania\r\n     Volunteers.'\r\n\r\nLoyal during the civil war of England, virtually an independent State\r\nunder Cromwell, it is the remarkable destiny of Virginia, so called in\r\nhonor of Queen Elizabeth's unmarried state, to have given birth to the\r\nspotless chief who conducted to a triumphant issue the American\r\nRevolution--to the orator who, more than any individual, by speech alone\r\nkindled the patriotic flame thereof--to the jurist whose clear and\r\ncandid mind and sagacious integrity gave dignity and permanence to\r\nconstitutional law--and to the statesman who advocated and established\r\nthe democratic principle and sentiment which essentially modified and\r\nmoulded the political character and career of the Republic, and he was\r\nthe author of that memorable Declaration of Independence which became\r\nthe charter of free nationality. From 1606, when three small vessels,\r\nwith a hundred or more men, sailed for the shores of Virginia under the\r\ncommand of Christopher Newport, and Smith planned Jamestown, to the last\r\npronunciamento of the rebel congress of Richmond, the documentary\r\nhistory of Virginia includes in charter, code, report, chronicle, plea,\r\nand protest, almost every possible element and form of political\r\nspeculation, civic justice, and seditious arrogance: and therein the\r\nphilosopher may find all that endears and hallows and all that\r\ndisintegrates and degrades the State as a social experiment and a moral\r\nfact: so that of all the States of the Union her antecedents, both noble\r\nand infamous, indicate Virginia as the most appropriate arena for the\r\nlast bitter conflict between the great antagonistic forces of civil\r\norder with those of social peace and progress. There where Washington, a\r\nyoung surveyor, became familiar with toil, exposure, and responsibility,\r\nhe passed the crowning years of his spotless career; where he was born,\r\nhe died and is buried; where Patrick Henry roamed and mused until the\r\nhour struck for him to rouse, with invincible eloquence, the instinct of\r\nfree citizenship; where Marshall drilled his yeoman for battle, and\r\ndisciplined his judicial mind by study; where Jefferson wrote his\r\npolitical philosophy and notes of a naturalist; where Burr was tried,\r\nClay was born, Wirt pleaded, Nat Turner instigated the Southampton\r\nmassacre, Lord Fairfax hunted, and John Brown was hung, Randolph\r\nbitterly jested, and Pocahontas won a holy fame--there treason reared\r\nits hydra head and profaned the consecrated soil with vulgar insults and\r\nsavage cruelty; there was the last battle scene of the Revolution and\r\nthe first of the Civil War; there is Mount Vernon, Monticello, and\r\nYorktown, and there also are Manassas, Bull Run, and Fredericksburg;\r\nthere is the old graveyard of Jamestown and the modern Golgotha of Fair\r\nOaks; there is the noblest tribute art has reared to Washington, and the\r\nmost loathsome prisons wherein despotism wreaked vengeance on\r\npatriotism; and on that soil countless martyrs have offered up their\r\nlives for the national existence, whose birth-pangs Virginia's peerless\r\nson shared, and over whose nascent being he kept such holy and intrepid\r\nvigil, bequeathing it as the most solemn of human trusts to those\r\nnearest to his local fame, by whom, with factious and fierce scorn, it\r\nhas been infamously betrayed on its own hallowed ground; whose best\r\nrenown shall yet be that it is the scene, not only of Freedom's\r\nsacrifice, but of her most pure and permanent triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHE DEFINES HER POSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lingering late in garden talk,\r\n    My friend and I, in the prime of June.\r\n  The long tree-shadows across the walk\r\n    Hinted the waning afternoon;\r\n  The bird-songs died in twitterings brief;\r\n    The clover was folding, leaf on leaf.\r\n\r\n  Fairest season of all the year,\r\n    And fairest of years in all my time;\r\n  Earth is so sweet, and heaven so near,\r\n    Sure life itself must be just at prime.\r\n  Soft flower-faces that crowd our way,\r\n    Have you no word for us to-day?\r\n\r\n  Each in its nature stands arrayed:\r\n    Heliotropes to drink the sun;\r\n  Violet-shadows to haunt the shade;\r\n    Poppies, by every wind undone;\r\n  Lilies, just over-proud for grace;\r\n    Pansies, that laugh in every face.\r\n\r\n  Great bloused Peonies, half adoze;\r\n    Mimulus, wild in change and freak;\r\n  Dainty flesh of the China Rose,\r\n    Tender and fine as a fairy's cheek;\r\n  (I watched him finger the folds apart\r\n    To get at the blush in its inmost heart.)\r\n\r\n  Lo, at our feet what small blue eyes!\r\n    And still, as we looked, their numbers came\r\n  Like shy stars out of the evening skies,\r\n    When the east is gray, and the west is flame.\r\n  --'Gather yourself, and give to me,\r\n    Those Forget-me-nots,' said he.\r\n\r\n  Word of command I take not ill;\r\n    When love commands, love likes to obey.\r\n  But, while my words my thoughts fulfil,\r\n    'Forget me not,' I will not say.\r\n  Vows for the false; an honest mind\r\n    Will not be bound, and will not bind.\r\n\r\n  In your need of me I put my trust,\r\n    And your lack of need shall be my ban;\r\n  'Tis time to remember, when you must;\r\n    Time to forget me, when you can.\r\n  Yet cannot the wildest thought of mine\r\n  Fancy a life distuned from thine.\r\n\r\n  ... Small reserve is between us two;\r\n    'Tis heart to heart, and brain to brain:\r\n  Bare as an arrow, straight and true,\r\n    Struck his thought to my thought again.\r\n  'Not distuned; one song of praise,\r\n  First and third, our lives shall raise.'\r\n\r\n  Close we stood in the rosy glow,\r\n    Watching the cloudland tower and town;\r\n  Watching the double Castor grow\r\n    Out of the east as the sun rolled down.\r\n  'Yonder, how star drinks star!' said he;\r\n  'Yield thou so; live thou in me.'\r\n\r\n  Nay, we are close--we are not one,\r\n    More than those stars that seem to shine\r\n  In the self-same place, yet each a sun,\r\n    Each distinct in its sphere divine.\r\n  Like to Himself art thou, we know;\r\n  Like to Himself am I also.\r\n\r\n  What did He mean, when He sent us forth,\r\n    Soul and soul, to this lower life?\r\n  Each with a purpose, each a worth,\r\n    Each an arm for the human strife.\r\n  Armor of thine is not for me;\r\n  Neither is mine adjudged by thee.\r\n\r\n  Now in the lower life we stand,\r\n    Weapons donned, and the strife begun;\r\n  Higher nor lower; hand to hand;\r\n    Each helps each with the glad 'Well done!'\r\n  Each girds each to nobler ends;\r\n  None less lovers because such friends.\r\n\r\n  So in the peace of the closing day,\r\n    Resting, as striving side by side,\r\n  What does He mean? again we say;\r\n    For what new lot are our souls allied?\r\n  Comes to my ken, in Death's advance,\r\n  Life in its next significance.\r\n\r\n  See yon tortoise; he crossed the path\r\n    At noon, to hide where the grass is tall;\r\n  In a slow half sense of the sun-king's wrath,\r\n    Burrowing close to the garden wall.\r\n  --Think, could we pour into that dull brain\r\n  A man's whole life, joy, thought, and pain!\r\n\r\n  So, methinks, is the life we lead,\r\n    To the larger life that next shall be:\r\n  Narrow in thought, uncouth in deed;\r\n    Crawling, who yet shall walk so free;\r\n  Walking, who yet on wings shall soar;\r\n  Flying, who shall need wings no more.\r\n\r\n  Lo, in the larger life we stand;\r\n    We drop the weapons, we take the tools:\r\n  We serve with mind who served with hand:\r\n    We live by laws who lived by rules.\r\n  And our old earth-love, with its mortal bliss,\r\n  Was the fancy of babe for babe, to this.\r\n\r\n  ... Visions begone! Above us rise\r\n    The worlds, on His work majestic sent.\r\n  Floating below, the small fireflies\r\n    Make up a tremulous firmament.\r\n  Stars in the grass, and roses dear,\r\n  Earth is full sweet, though heaven is near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIFFS FROM MY MEERSCHAUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have that same old meerschaum yet--the same that I clasped to my lips\r\nin the days that are gone, and through whose fragrant, wavy clouds, as\r\nthey floated round my head, I saw--sometimes clear and bright, sometimes\r\ndimmed by a mist of rising tears--visions of childhood's joyous hours,\r\nof schoolboy's days, of youth, with its vague dreams and longings, of\r\nearly manhood, and its high hopes and proud anticipations.\r\n\r\nI smoke it still, though the tobacco be not always the choicest--for one\r\ncannot be fastidious in the army, and sutlers do not keep much of an\r\nassortment--and still it brings me sweet dreams, though of a different\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nYes, old and tried friend, times have greatly changed in the few years\r\nthat we have been together. Sons have been torn from fond parents;\r\nbrothers have snatched hasty kisses from tearful sisters, and marched\r\noff to the tap of the drum with firm step and flashing eyes, while,\r\nbeneath, the heart beat low and mournfully; young men and maidens, in\r\nthe rosy flush of dawning love, have parted in sadness, but proudly\r\nfacing the duty and bravely trusting the future and the eternal Right.\r\nOver many a noble fellow, on the bloody fields of Shiloh and Antietam\r\nand Stone River, the wings of the death-angel have fallen; at many a\r\nhearthstone there is mourning for the brave that are dead on the field\r\nof honor--though it is a royal sorrow, and a proud light gleams through\r\nthe fast-falling tears.\r\n\r\nBut you and I, my faithful comrade, are together still. Next to my heart\r\nI have carried you many a weary league; many a dreary and, but for you,\r\ncomfortless night we have bivouacked together. Time and roughing it have\r\nmade their marks on both of us. Scars mar your polished face, now\r\nchanged from spotless white to rich autumnal russet; and mine, too, the\r\nsun, and wind, and other smoke than that of Orinoko have darkened. You\r\nhave lost your ornamental silver cap, and amber-mouthed stem, and I my\r\npolished two-storied 'tile' and the tail of my coat. But never mind; if\r\nwe are battered and bruised, and scratched and scarred, and knocked\r\naround till the end of time, we will never lose our identity; and if we\r\nlive till I am as bald as you are, we will always be good friends. Won't\r\nwe, old boy, eh?\r\n\r\nAnd the old boy murmurs an unqualified assent.\r\n\r\nPuff! puff! Your face lights up as brightly, and your fragrant breath\r\ncomes as freely here by the campfire, as when we were at home, and had\r\nour slippered feet upon the mantelpiece before the old-fashioned\r\n'Franklin,' and were surrounded by our books and our pictures, and the\r\nnumerous _little things_, souvenirs, perhaps valueless in themselves,\r\nbut highly prized, and reluctantly left to the tender mercies of the\r\nthoughtless and unappreciating.\r\n\r\nAnd it is these _little things_ that the soldier misses most and most\r\nfrequently longs for. It is not the feather bed or the warm biscuits\r\nthat he thinks of, but that dainty little penwiper, with his initials\r\nworked in it, and those embroidered slippers, that _she_ gave him. He\r\nwould not give a contractor's conscience for sweet milk; but he would\r\nlike to have his smoking cap.\r\n\r\nI once seriously thought of sending home for a certain _terra cotta_\r\nvase for holding cigars--a mantelpiece ornament; but I happened to\r\nremember that I had cigars very seldom, and a mantelpiece not at all,\r\nand concluded not to send.\r\n\r\nMany of these little things the young soldier will bring from home with\r\nhim, in spite of the pooh-poohs of practical parents, and carry with\r\nhim, in spite of the sneers of thoughtless comrades. I know a fellow who\r\ncarries in his breast pocket the withered, odorless skeleton of a\r\nbouquet, that was given him on the day he left home, and who will carry\r\nit till he returns, or till it is reddened with his blood. And when I\r\nsee a man, in the face of ridicule and brutal scoffing, through long\r\nmarches and weary days of dispiriting labor, clinging with fond tenacity\r\nto some little memento of the past, I set him down as a man with his\r\nheart in the right place, who will do his country and God good service\r\nwhen there is need. And--it is well to practise what one admires in\r\nothers--I confess that I have a smoking cap that I have often packed\r\ninto my knapsack, at the expense of a pair of socks; and I would rather\r\nhave left out my only shirt that was off duty than that it should have\r\nfailed to go with me. Yes, dear girls, your little presents, perhaps\r\nforgotten by you, by us are fondly cherished; and around them all hover,\r\nlike the perfume of fresh flowers, fragrant memories of the merry days\r\ngone by, and dreams of starry eyes and laughing lips, of floating\r\ndrapery and flashing jewels, and moonlit summer nights in the dear\r\nNorthland.\r\n\r\nMay your eyes ne'er grow dim, nor your smiles fade away!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LEVANA; or, The Doctrine of Education. Translated from the\r\n     German of JEAN PAUL FRIEDRICH RICHTER, Author of 'Flower,\r\n     Fruit, and Thorn Pieces, 'Titan,' 'Walt and Vult,' etc., etc.\r\n     Boston: Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe mere annunciation of a book, as yet unknown to the American public,\r\nfrom the pen of Jean Paul Richter, will be sufficient to awaken the\r\nattention of all cultivated readers. He who has read and loved one book\r\nof this marvellous writer, will not easily rest until he has read them\r\nall. He is known in Germany as Jean Paul der Einzige,--Jean Paul, the\r\nOnly--and it is true that he is the unimitated and the inimitable. He is\r\n_utterly_ unlike Shakspeare, and yet more like him in his grand\r\ncharities and breadth of range than like any other author. He is the\r\n'Only,' the genial, the humorous, the pathetic, the tender, the satiric,\r\nthe original, the erudite, the creative--the poet, sage, and scholar.\r\nBut we might exhaust ourselves in expletives, and yet fail to give any\r\nidea of his rich imagery, his wonderful power, his natural and tender\r\npathos. Besides, who does not already know him as a really great writer,\r\nthrough the appreciative criticisms of Thomas Carlyle?\r\n\r\n'Levana' is a work on Education, written as Jean Paul alone could write\r\nit. In order to give our readers some idea of the nature of the subjects\r\ntreated therein, we place before them a part of the table of contents:\r\nImportance of Education; Proof that Education Effects Little; Spirit and\r\nPrinciple of Education; To Discover and Appreciate the Individuality of\r\nthe Ideal Man; On the Spirit of the Age; Religious Education; The\r\nBeginning of Education; The Joyousness of Children; Games of Children;\r\nChildren's Dances; Music; Commands, Prohibitions, Punishments, and\r\nCrying; Screaming and Crying of Children; On the Trustfulness of\r\nChildren; On Physical Education; On the Destination of Women; Nature of\r\nWomen; Education of Girls; Education of the Affections; On the\r\nDevelopment of the Desire for Intellectual Progress; Speech and Writing;\r\nAttention and the Power of Adaptive Combination; Development of Wit;\r\nDevelopment of Reflection, Abstraction, and Self-Knowledge; On the\r\nEducation of the Recollection--not of the Memory; Development of the\r\nSense of Beauty; Classical Education, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWe have often wondered why this book was not given to American readers;\r\nit was published in England, in its English dress, at least ten years\r\nago. It addresses itself to parents, treating neither of national nor\r\ncongregational education; it elevates neither state nor priest into\r\neducator; but it devolves that duty where the interest ought ever to be,\r\non the parents, and particularly on the mother. In closing the preface\r\nto this book, Baireuth, May 2, 1806, Jean Paul says: 'It would be my\r\ngreatest reward if, at the end of twenty years, some reader, as many\r\nyears old, should return thanks to me, that the book which he is then\r\nreading was read by his parents.'\r\n\r\nMay this work find many readers, and true, appreciative admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FLOWER, FRUIT, AND THORN PIECES; or, The Married Life,\r\n     Death, and Wedding of the Advocate of the Poor, Firmian Stanislaus\r\n     Siebenkäs.

We have long known and prized 'Flower, Fruit, and Thorn Pieces.'\r\nThe writings of Richter have humanity for their text, and it has always\r\nbeen a matter of astonishment to us that they were not more widely known\r\nin this country. His style is peculiar, it is true, but it is the\r\npeculiarity of originality, never of affectation. His illustrations are\r\ndrawn from every source, from science, art, history, biography, national\r\nmanners, customs, civilized and savage; his imagery is varied,\r\nexquisite, and natural, and his religion embraces all creeds and sects.\r\nHe is the preacher of immortal hopes, of love to God, and all-embracing\r\nhuman charities. His plots are merely threads to string his pearls,\r\nopals, and diamonds upon. We prefer him greatly to the cold, worldly,\r\nand classic Goethe. His works always have a meaning, for he was a lofty\r\nand original thinker. He was colossal and magnanimous both as man and\r\nwriter. Carlyle says of him: 'His intellect is keen, impetuous,\r\nfar-grasping, fit to rend in pieces the stubbornest materials, and\r\nextort from them their most hidden and refractory truth. In his Humor he\r\nsports with the highest and lowest; he can play at bowls with the Sun\r\nand Moon. His Imagination opens for us the Land of Dreams; we sail with\r\nhim through the boundless Abyss; and the secrets of Space, and Time, and\r\nLife, and Annihilation hover round us in dim, cloudy forms; and\r\ndarkness, and immensity, and dread encompass and overshadow us. Nay, in\r\nhandling the smallest matter, he works it with the tools of a giant. A\r\ncommon truth is wrenched from its old combinations, and presented to us\r\nin new, impassable, abysmal contrast with its opposite error. A trifle,\r\nsome slender character, some jest, quip, or spiritual toy, is shaped\r\ninto the most quaint, yet often truly living form; but shaped somehow as\r\nwith the hammer of Vulcan, with three strokes that might have helped to\r\nforge an Ægis. The treasures of his mind are of a similar description\r\nwith the mind itself; his knowledge is gathered from all the kingdoms of\r\nArt, and Science, and Nature, and lies round him in huge unwieldy heaps.\r\nHis very language is Titanian; deep, strong, tumultuous; shining with a\r\nthousand hues, fused from a thousand elements, and winding in\r\nlabyrinthic masses.' We recommend Jean Paul to universal study; he will,\r\nin spite of all his grotesque and broken arabesques, amply repay it.\r\n\r\n     BROKEN COLUMNS. Sheldon & Co., 335 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous novel, by one who says: 'I shall not say I have not\r\naforetime walked openly in the highway of literature, but on this\r\noccasion the public must indulge me with the use of a thick veil; a\r\nveil, albeit, which will allow me to observe whether smiles or frowns\r\nmark the public countenance.'\r\n\r\nThe author will without doubt find both smiles and frowns on the faces\r\nhe would regard. His characters are novel, the situations eccentric, the\r\ndenouements unexpected. Love is made the solvent and reformer of vice.\r\nThe sinner seems not actually depraved, but ever ready to return to the\r\npath of virtue. Forgiveness is the elixir of reformation and\r\nregeneration. Charity controls the inner life. The work contains\r\npassages of great beauty, though the style is often broken and rugged.\r\nIt is philanthropic, and full of pity for the erring. We fail to\r\nunderstand the characters, because we have never seen coarse vice\r\nassociated with tenderness and refinement. It is true, as our author\r\nsays, that 'in seeking the reclamation of our fellow creatures, we are\r\nnothing less than co-workers with God.' But it is a solemn task, and\r\ncharity itself is subject to the laws of eternal justice.\r\n\r\n     THE OLD MERCHANTS OF NEW YORK CITY. By WALTER\r\n     BARRETT, Clerk. Second Series. Carleton, publisher, 413\r\n     Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nThe first series of this book had a circulation so extensive that its\r\nauthor gives to the world another volume. The motto of the work seems to\r\nbe, 'The crowning city--whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers\r\nare the _honorable_ of the earth.' It is not a series of biographies,\r\nbut light, gossiping sketches of persons, things, manners, the\r\neccentricities of noted men, the transfers of well-known pieces of\r\nproperty, the changes in firms, the improvements in streets and\r\nbuildings, the gradual extension of old and the introduction of new\r\nbranches of trade and business, the intermarriages of families, etc.,\r\netc. To those familiar with the business habits of New York, acquainted\r\nwith its localities, interested in the origin and early history of its\r\nmercantile families, of whom the book contains many personal anecdotes,\r\nwe presume it will prove amusing and entertaining.\r\n\r\n     VINCENZO; or, Sunken Rocks. A Novel, by JOHN\r\n     RUFFINI, Author of 'Doctor Antonio,' 'Lavinia,' etc. Carleton,\r\n     publisher, 413 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\n'Dr. Antonio' had many admirers both here and in England, and is already\r\nin the second edition. The scene of Vincenzo is laid in Italy, during\r\nthe progress of the Italian Revolution. The 'Sunken Rocks' are the\r\nwidely differing religious and political views of husband and wife; and\r\nour author closes his tale in saying: 'Would to God, at least, that the\r\ncase of the Candias was an isolated one! But no; there is scarcely any\r\ncorner in Europe that does not exhibit plenty of such, and worse. God\r\nalone knows the number of families whose domestic peace has been, of\r\nlate years, seriously damaged, or has gone to wreck altogether on those\r\nvery rocks so fatal to Vincenzo.' Alas! that the present civil war\r\nshould have given birth to much of the same domestic alienation and\r\nbitterness in our own midst as we find portrayed in the novel before us.\r\nSuffering of this kind, real and severe, exists among ourselves,\r\nsaddening the heart of many a woman, and paralyzing the exertions of\r\nmany a man who would else be patriotic and loyal.\r\n\r\n     PIQUE. A Novel. Loring, publisher, 319 Washington street,\r\n     Boston. For sale by Oliver S. Fell, 36 Walker street, New York.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that this book will excite considerable attention in\r\nthe novel-reading world. It is in all probability destined to become as\r\npopular as the one of which, without being any imitation, it frequently\r\nreminds us--we mean 'The Initials.' The characters portrayed in 'Pique'\r\ndevelop themselves through the means of spirited conversations, arising\r\nfrom the surrounding circumstances--conversations always natural and\r\nwithout exaggeration. The pages are never dull, the story being varied\r\nand full of interest. It is a tale of the affections, of the home\r\ncircle, of jealousies, misconceptions, perversions, feelings, the\r\nincidents growing naturally out of the defects and excellences of the\r\nindividuals depicted. The scene is laid in England; the local coloring\r\nand characters being thoroughly English. Modern life and modern traits\r\nare portrayed with considerable skill and cleverness. The moral tone is\r\nthroughout is unexceptionable. We commend 'Pique' to all lovers of\r\nrefined, spirited, and detailed home novels.\r\n\r\n     MEDITATIONS ON LIFE AND ITS RELIGIOUS DUTIES. Translated\r\n     from the German of Zschokke. By FREDERICA ROWAN. Boston:\r\n     Ticknor and Fields, 1863. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of these 'Meditations' is eminently practical, and the\r\nsubjects treated are of universal application and interest. The\r\ntranslation is dedicated to Princess Alice, of England, now of Hesse,\r\nand is well executed, preserving the beauty and simplicity of the\r\noriginal, and supplying a need frequently felt in current religious\r\nliterature, where vague reveries too often usurp the place of sensible\r\ncounsel and life-improving suggestions.\r\n\r\n     PETER CARRADINE; or, The Martindale Pastoral By\r\n     CAROLINE CHESEBRO'. Sheldon &, Company, 335 Broadway.\r\n     Gould & Lincoln, Boston.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet had time to read this 'Pastoral' for ourselves, but it\r\nis highly commended by Marion Harland, author of 'Alone.' 'The story is\r\nconfined within the limits of a country neighborhood, but there is\r\nvariety of character, motive, and action. You are reminded that the\r\nauthoress writes with a purpose, as well as a power, that the earnest,\r\nGod-fearing soul of the philanthropist has travailed here for the good\r\nof her kind, not the mere 'sensation' romancist writer for the\r\nentertainment of an idle hour.' We quote from Marion Harland.\r\n\r\n     EXCURSIONS. By HENRY D. THOREAU, Author of\r\n     'Walden,' and 'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.' Boston:\r\n     Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nHenry David Thoreau was a man of decided genius, and an ardent lover of\r\nnature. His eye was open to beauty, and his ear to music. He found\r\nthese, not in rare conditions, but wheresoever he went. He was sincerity\r\nitself, and no cant or affectation is to be found in his writings. He\r\nwas religious in his own way; incapable of any profanation, by act or\r\nthought, although his original living and thinking detached him from the\r\nsocial religious forms. He thought that without religion no great deed\r\nhad ever been accomplished. He was disgusted with crime, and no worldly\r\nsuccess could cover it. He loved nature so well, and was so happy in her\r\nsolitude, that he became very jealous of cities and the sad work which\r\ntheir refinements and artifices made with man and his dwelling. The axe\r\nwas always destroying his forest. 'Thank God,' he said, 'they cannot cut\r\ndown the clouds.'\r\n\r\nWe have taken the above traits from the exceedingly interesting\r\nbiographical sketch introducing this book, from the masterly hand of\r\nR. W. Emerson. The writings of Thoreau are the result of his character,\r\nmodelled from and colored by the tastes and habits of his daily life.\r\nNature lives in his pages. We know of no more delightful reading. He\r\nsays: 'A truly good book is something as natural, and as unexpectedly\r\nand unaccountably fair and perfect, as a wild flower discovered on the\r\nprairies of the West or in the jungles of the East. Where is the\r\nliterature which gives expression to nature? He would be a poet who\r\ncould impress the winds and streams into his service, to speak for him;\r\nwho nailed words to their primitive senses, as farmers drive down stakes\r\nin the spring, which the frost has heaved; who derived his words as\r\noften as he used them--transplanted them to his page with earth adhering\r\nto their roots; whose words were so true, and fresh, and natural that\r\nthey would appear to expand like buds at the approach of spring, though\r\nthey lay half-smothered between two musty leaves in a library--aye to\r\nbloom and bear fruit there, after their kind, annually, for the faithful\r\nreader, in sympathy with surrounding nature.'\r\n\r\nSuch a poet is Thoreau, and fair and perfect as the wild flowers of the\r\nprairies are his 'good books.' In the above extract he has himself\r\ndescribed them. Who knows not his 'Autumnal Tints,' and 'Wild Apples,'\r\nand who has ever read them without loving them? Theodore Winthrop's\r\n'Life in the Open Air,' 'Out-door Papers,' by T. W. Higginson, and\r\n'Excursions,' by H. D. Thoreau, are books which could only have been\r\nwritten in America, and of which an American may justly feel proud. They\r\nare in themselves a library for the country, and we heartily commend\r\nthem to all who love nature and the fresh breath of the forest.\r\n\r\n     THE GREAT STONE BOOK OF NATURE. By DAVID THOMAS\r\n     ANSTED, M. A., F. R. S., F. G. S., etc. Late Fellow of Jesus\r\n     College, Cambridge; Honorary Fellow of King's College, London.\r\n     Published by George W. Childs, 628 and 630 Chestnut Street,\r\n     Philadelphia, 1863. Received per favor of C. T. Evans, 448\r\n     Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nTo popularize scientific knowledge is one of the most difficult of\r\ntasks. Men of real science are rarely willing to spare the necessary\r\ntime, and the work is ordinarily undertaken by a class of pseudo\r\nsavants, who have just acquired that little learning which is so\r\ndangerous a thing. Deductions and results are all that can be set before\r\nthe people, who are unable to follow scientific processes, and who are\r\nhence liable to receive impressions, the truth or error of which must\r\ndepend upon the fairness and logical acumen of the individual mind\r\naddressing them. The work before us is evidently written by one\r\nthoroughly conversant with the subject under consideration, and the\r\nauthor seems careful to assert no fact or affirm no conclusion not\r\nstrictly warranted by actual research. Solid works of this kind ought to\r\nbe warmly welcomed, and as such we recommend the above to our reading\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n     REMAINS IN VERSE AND PROSE, OF ARTHUR HENRY HALLAM. With a\r\n     Preface and Memoir. Ticknor & Fields, Boston.\r\n\r\nArthur Henry Hallam possessed the friendship of one who ranks high among\r\nthe living poets of England--Tennyson. How bitterly the poet felt his\r\ndeath, he has himself testified in his 'In Memoriam,' a book which has\r\nmany admirers both in England and America. The image of young Hallam\r\nhovers like a lovely shadow over these yearning poems devoted to the\r\nmemory of the regretted friend; his 'Remains,' will enable us to\r\nunderstand why he excited a love so tender and respectful, and left so\r\ndeep a grief for his loss when he passed away. 'From the earliest years\r\nof this extraordinary young man, his premature abilities were not more\r\nconspicuous than an almost faultless disposition, sustained by a more\r\ncalm self-command than has often been witnessed in that season of life.\r\nThe sweetness of temper that distinguished his childhood, became, with\r\nthe advance of manhood, an habitual benevolence, and ultimately ripened\r\ninto that exalted principle of love toward God and man, which animated\r\nand almost absorbed his soul during the latter period of his life, and\r\nto which his compositions bear such emphatic testimony.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Remains' of such a spirit cannot fail to be interesting. We were\r\nespecially pleased with the 'Oration on the Influence of Italian Works\r\nof Imagination on the same class of compositions in England.' The great\r\nItalians seldom receive their full meed of praise, either from the\r\nEnglish or ourselves. Some very mature remarks are also made upon the\r\ninfluence of German mind upon English literature.\r\n\r\n     THE REJECTED WIFE. By Mrs. ANN S. STEPHENS,\r\n     Author of 'Fashion and Famine,' 'The Old Homestead,' 'Mary\r\n     Derwent,' &c. T. B. Peterson & Brothers, Chestnut street,\r\n     Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA novel in which are depicted the early days of Benedict Arnold. The\r\ncharacters are well drawn and sustained, and the tale one of\r\nconsiderable interest. The fright and agony of the fair, young, deserted\r\nwife are delicately and skilfully drawn; most of the scenes in which she\r\nis introduced are full of nature and simple pathos. The pictures of\r\nPuritan manners, lives, and thoughts, are graphic and truthful. We\r\ncommend the book to all lovers of a good, pure, domestic novel.\r\n\r\n     PINNEO'S ANALYTICAL GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE:\r\n     Designed for Schools. By T. S. PINNEO, M. A., M. D.,\r\n     Author of 'Primary Grammar,' 'Hemans Reader,' &c. Revised and\r\n     enlarged. New York: Clark, Austin & Smith; Cincinnati: W. B. Smith\r\n     & Co.\r\n\r\nThis work is intended to succeed the author's 'Primary Grammar,' being,\r\nhowever, complete in itself. It presents a full view of the\r\nwell-established principles of the English language, in their practical\r\nbearing on _analysis_ and _construction_. No space is wasted on the\r\ndiscussion of curious or unimportant points, which, however interesting\r\nto the critical student, always encumbers an elementary work. Simplicity\r\nin definitions, examples, exercises, and arrangement, has been carefully\r\nstudied. The exercises are full and numerous; a large portion of them\r\ndesigned to teach, at the same time, the _nature_, _properties_, and\r\n_relations_ of words, and the _analysis_ and _construction_ of\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n'Model Class-Books on the English Language have been produced by\r\nProfessor Pinneo, and they should be adopted as standard text-books in\r\nthe schools of the United States.'-_Educational Reports_.\r\n\r\n     THE BRITISH AMERICAN.

If we are satisfied with the\r\ngeneral scope and tendency of thought presented by respectable writers\r\nwho appear in their own names, we do not care to make known any minor\r\ndifferences of opinion, or to criticise what we consider the errors of\r\ntheir productions. Nevertheless, we suppose that a calm and friendly\r\nexpression of our own thoughts, on any subject discussed in our pages,\r\nwill not be out of place or unkindly received in any quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the very able and interesting article in our last number, by Mr.\r\nFreeland, that writer announced the doctrine that 'the social,\r\npolitical, religious, and scientific development of the world proceeds\r\nunder the operation of two grand antagonistic principles,' which he\r\ncalls respectively, 'Unity,' and 'Individuality.' 'The first of these,'\r\nhe says, 'tends to bring about coöperation, consolidation, convergence,\r\ndependence; the second to produce separation, isolation, divergence, and\r\nindependence. Unity is the principle which tends to order; Individuality\r\nto freedom.'\r\n\r\nWe are prepared to admit the existence and operation of these principles\r\nas stated. They constitute the active tendencies of society, and they\r\nperform in the social world precisely what the antagonistic forces of\r\nattraction and repulsion do in the physical. They are the principles of\r\naggregation and organization, as well as of agitation, conflict, and all\r\nrevolutionary or progressive activity. In a more perfect state of\r\ndevelopment, they will exhibit themselves as the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces of a beautiful system arrived at that stage of\r\nregulated motion which constitutes a stable equilibrium.\r\n\r\nBut while we admit the universal operation of these two principles, we\r\nthink Mr. Freeland has made a serious mistake in the application of\r\nthem,--a mistake which seems to run through his entire essay, and to\r\npervade the whole system of his philosophy. We shall venture upon a\r\nbrief criticism, solely with the view of eliminating truth. The\r\nquestion, though somewhat abstract in its nature, is to us of the\r\nhighest interest; and we shall ever be ready to yield our position, when\r\nconvinced that it is erroneous and untenable.\r\n\r\nWe find what we consider the exceptionable doctrine in the following\r\npassage: 'Unity is allied to the affections, which are synthetic in\r\ntheir character; Individuality, to the intellect, which is mainly\r\nanalytical and disruptive in its tendency. Unity is predominant in\r\nreligion, which is static in its nature; Individuality to science, which\r\nis primarily disturbing. In the distribution of the mental faculties,\r\nUnity relates to the moral powers, and Individuality to the\r\nintellectual; the former being, as both Mr. Buckle and Professor Draper\r\nhave shown, more stationary in their character than the latter. As in\r\nthis paragraph the 'affections' are placed in contrast with the\r\n'intellect,' we suppose that by the former the writer intends to\r\ndesignate the emotions or passions, thus making that most obvious\r\nanalysis of the mind into halves--the active impulses and moral\r\nprinciples on the one hand, and the perceptive and reflective faculties\r\non the other. There is some little confusion of statement, in afterward\r\ncontrasting the 'moral powers' with the 'intellectual;' but we imagine\r\nthat the same general classification is intended, although not quite\r\ndefined with philosophical accuracy.\r\n\r\nIf we are correct in this interpretation of the language quoted, we do\r\nnot see how the emotional part of human nature can, in any general\r\nsense, be said to be allied to unity. The passions are the basis of all\r\nhuman agitation and conflict, and have been the cause of all the wars\r\nwhich have engaged mankind during the past ages of the world. In the\r\nearly periods of history the selfish emotions have preponderated over\r\nthe benevolent. Hatred, ambition, avarice, have been superior to love,\r\nhumility, and charity. It is more than doubtful whether, even now, the\r\nselfish passions of the human race are not still in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that, in the long run, the emotions tend to harmony, and\r\nthat the coöperative and benevolent feelings are continually approaching\r\ntheir final and complete triumph. This is undoubtedly true; but it is\r\nwholly attributable to the progress of the human intellect, which, day\r\nby day, is demonstrating that man's emotional and moral nature can find\r\nits highest enjoyment and its most perfect development only in the\r\ncomplete subordination of the selfish and unsocial passions, to those\r\nwhich promote universal toleration and brotherhood.\r\n\r\nBut if Mr. Freeland is wrong in the position that the primary tendency\r\nof the passions is to unity, he seems to us equally far from scientific\r\ntruth when he asserts that intellect is 'disrupting' in its tendency,\r\nand that science is primarily 'disturbing.' It is true the intellect has\r\nthe analytical faculty; but it is equally true that the opposite faculty\r\nof generalization is that which most strongly characterizes it and\r\ndistinguishes reason from instinct. So far from analysis being the\r\nearliest predominant tendency of the intellect, almost all its most\r\nfamiliar and ordinary acts are those of synthesis. In all the phenomena\r\nof perception, the separate sensations are combined by an act of the\r\njudgment into the concrete ideas of form and substance, while the\r\nhighest and most permanent characteristic of science is in the\r\ncomprehensive attainment of general laws.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth of the whole case is, that the affections or passions\r\nof men are the motive powers which impel them to action in every field\r\nof human affairs. The intellect, on the contrary, dominates these motive\r\npowers by its faculty of unfolding truth, foreseeing consequences,\r\nexploring the path of practicable progress, and illuminating the objects\r\nof rational desire to humanity. In the passions of men we have the two\r\nantagonistic forces--the attraction and repulsion--the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal tendencies--which ever antagonize each other, and through\r\nall the conflicts and agitations of mankind, are tending to eventual\r\nharmony. The moral faculty is a mere standard of right and wrong, which,\r\nof course, remains comparatively fixed and permanent through all the\r\nages. The changes of opinion and action, in the sense of morality, are\r\ndue wholly to the difference of knowledge at successive periods. Just as\r\nthe intellect is capable of determining the bearing and consequences of\r\nhuman action, and of fixing the intention with reference to such\r\nconsequences, will the moral character of such action be pronounced,\r\nmore or less correctly, according to the degree of enlightenment of the\r\nparties concerned.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis it will be plainly seen, that all the force is in the\r\npassions or desires of men. These are enlightened, and therefore\r\nregulated by the intellect, and judged by the moral faculty according to\r\nthe consequences foreseen and intended. Ideas alone have the power of\r\norganization. The passions attend upon ideas as their ministers and\r\nservants. Beliefs, which represent the ideas or knowledge prevalent at\r\nsuccessive periods in history, have controlled the destiny of men and\r\nnations, and all human passions have been marshalled and arrayed in\r\nconformity with them.\r\n\r\nThe error of Mr. Freeland, we respectfully submit, is in placing the\r\nintellect and the passions in antagonism with each other, while, in\r\ntruth, it is one passion, or one class of passions, which antagonizes\r\nanother. The direction given to society by the predominating force of\r\nall the individual propensities is retrogressive, stationary, or\r\nprogressive, revolutionary and destructive, or moderate and safe,\r\naccording to the knowledge of facts and the prevision of consequences\r\nwhich may inform the judgments and enlighten the consciences of the\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nAt periods of general ignorance and superstition, the announcement of a\r\ngreat scientific or philosophic truth may produce commotion,\r\npersecution, and discord. But it is evident that these are the results\r\nof ignorance and not of knowledge--of unenlightened passion, and not of\r\nthe awakened intellect. Truth is attractive to all minds, and its\r\ntendency is to invite universal assent. In so far, therefore, as the\r\nintellect is capable of discovering truth, its tendency is to unify and\r\nharmonize, and by no means to separate into disorder. In an age of\r\ninquiry, the emancipation of thought may be attended with much\r\ndisturbance. The right of individual judgment will necessarily produce\r\nconflict in the very act of emerging from the preceding state of\r\nignorance and restraint. The state of transition cannot be one of\r\ntranquillity, although it is the inevitable path to a higher and more\r\ncomplete harmony. But it is inaccurate and philosophically untrue, as we\r\nthink, to characterize the intellect as 'disturbing,' or 'disrupting.'\r\nIt is disturbing only to ignorance, and disrupting only to the systems\r\nand organizations based upon falsehood.\r\n\r\nWe think these positions and brief discriminations are accurate, and not\r\nto be overthrown by argument; and as they are fundamental, we have\r\nthought it not improper to state them here, as the basis upon which we\r\naccept the general reasoning of Mr. Freeland as to the law of human\r\ndevelopment. Buckle and Draper are right as to the fixed character of\r\nmoral standards; but the progressive development of knowledge gives new\r\napplications to moral principles, and requires their perpetual operation\r\nand control. In this sense, morality keeps pace with knowledge, and\r\nthough dependent upon new truths for its own advancement, is\r\nindispensable to the progress of mankind in the social benefits to be\r\nderived from every intellectual acquisition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA musical example of a rhythm rare and difficult of treatment in\r\nEnglish--the dactylic.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\nGONE!\r\n\r\nBY EARL MARBLE.\r\n\r\n  Gone from the earth, in her innocence, purity,\r\n    Gone, 'mong her bright sister angels to dwell;\r\n  Gone, to explore the dark shades of Futurity,\r\n    Gone to her final home!

Coxwell and Glaisher, were\r\naccompanied in their celestial excursion by several private individuals\r\nof distinction, and among the rest by the Hon. Robert J. Walker, of this\r\ncountry, whose able contributions have done so much to enhance the value\r\nof THE CONTINENTAL. Some years ago, this gentleman had the\r\nscientific curiosity to descend to the bottom of the sea, in a new\r\ndiving apparatus, just then invented; and recently he has been driven\r\nthrough a tunnel on a railway, by the pneumatic process, which in\r\ncertain locations and conditions, will probably hereafter be substituted\r\nfor the ordinary power of the locomotive engine. He seems to be not only\r\nready to welcome all valuable improvements in science and mechanics, but\r\nis ready himself to take the risks of dangerous exploration in the\r\npursuit of knowledge and for the promotion of progress.\r\n\r\nBut of all such adventures, that into the regions of the atmosphere is\r\nby far the most interesting. Living immersed in this great ocean of air\r\nand moisture which surrounds the earth, and is the theatre of all the\r\ngrand, beautiful, benignant, and often terrific phenomena of\r\nmeteorology, it is no more than a very natural curiosity which induces\r\nus to seek by aërial exploration to understand its physical\r\npeculiarities, and to make use of the vast resources which it will\r\ndoubtless soon afford to the genius and enterprise of the human race.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, we believe, it has been considered a settled fact, that\r\nthe atmosphere was limited to the height of about forty-five miles, that\r\nbeing estimated as the limit at which the earth's attraction would be\r\nbalanced by the expansive force of the particles of air. But in this\r\nproblem there is an element of complication in the rotation of the\r\natmosphere with the earth on its axis. Near the surface, and for a great\r\ndistance upward, the air is but a part of the solid globe, or rather an\r\nappendage to it, moving with it in all respects like the denser fluid\r\nwhich constitutes the mighty ocean. But there must be a point in the\r\nascent upward, where the centrifugal force of the particles of air, in\r\nthe diurnal rotation, must over-balance the power of gravitation; and\r\nfrom that limit, the motions of the atmosphere must be subject to a law\r\nof a wholly different character--partaking of the nature of planetary\r\nrevolution, rather than of axial rotation. The latest speculations as to\r\nthe height of the atmosphere, seem to have reached only this degree of\r\ncertainty, viz., that it does not extend so far as the orbit of the\r\nmoon. Otherwise, it is argued, the superior attraction of that body, in\r\nits immediate vicinity, would aggregate a considerable quantity of the\r\nair about it, which would tend to retard the motions of the satellite in\r\nits orbit, and of the earth on its axis; whereas, the revolutions and\r\nrotations of both are known to have been uniform for a period as far\r\nback as authentic observation extends.\r\n\r\nBut these speculations, however curious and interesting, are of no\r\npractical importance. We shall never be able to traverse the air to any\r\ngreat distance above the earth's surface. Independent of mechanical\r\ndifficulties, two great impediments will forever prevent the realization\r\nof any such ambitions aspirations. These are the increase of cold and\r\ndecrease of pressure in the upper regions of the air, and the deficiency\r\nof oxygen in the rarefied element for the support of animal life. It is\r\nwell known that at the earth's surface, the pressure on all parts of the\r\nbody, internal and external, by the weight of the superincumbent\r\natmosphere, is no less than 14½ pounds to every square inch. The\r\nstructure of the human body is physiologically conformed by nature to\r\nthis pressure, and it cannot survive with any very great change of this\r\namount, either by increase or diminution. When one descends into the\r\nwater, the pressure is doubled at about 32 feet of depth. In ascending\r\nin the atmosphere, the pressure is diminished much less rapidly, of\r\ncourse, but quite sensibly when the altitude becomes very great.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Coxwell and Glaisher are said to have ascended in 1862 to a\r\nheight of seven and a half miles. One of these gentlemen became entirely\r\ninsensible from cold and want of oxygen, and the other very nearly so,\r\nbeing obliged to open the valve of the balloon with his teeth for want\r\nof the use of his hands.\r\n\r\nNature provides a partial remedy for the difficulty of breathing in the\r\nupper regions of the atmosphere. In the effort to breathe, the lungs are\r\nfound to expand and to develop air cells not ordinarily used, so as to\r\nbring a larger quantity of the rarefied air into contact with the blood.\r\nIt has been proposed to assist this effort of nature, and, in order to\r\nenable the aëronaut to reach a greater altitude with safety, to carry up\r\nin bags a supply of oxygen for breathing. As air is carried or forced\r\ndown into the water to enable the diver to breathe, so it may be\r\nconveyed upward for the benefit of the aërial adventurer.\r\n\r\nBut with all possible expedients, it is not probable that man will ever\r\nbe able to get far away from the surface of the earth which is his\r\nnatural place of abode. If he can explore the lower strata immediately\r\nadjoining his own theatre of action--the strata in which all the great\r\nand important phenomena of meteorology take place--and if he can succeed\r\nin traversing it at his pleasure with safety and some degree of\r\ncelerity, as we doubt not he will eventually, this great achievement\r\nwill subserve all the useful purposes possible to be derived from such\r\nskill and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere will still be the vast reservoir of oxygen, nitrogen, and\r\ncarbon, from winch all living things in the air, on the earth, or in the\r\ndepths of the boundless ocean, whether animal or vegetable, draw far the\r\ngreater part of their nutriment. We can never reach the surface of this\r\natmospheric ocean, for that would be for us a region of inanity and\r\ndeath; but there is scarcely a doubt that we shall freely use it in the\r\nfuture for purposes of locomotion, at the same time that we breathe and\r\nassimilate it as the very pabulum and substance of our mortal bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM!\r\n\r\n  Far in the wood he lieth,\r\n    Sleeping alone\r\n  Where the wind of autumn sigheth,\r\n    Making its moan,\r\n  Where the golden beams are leaping\r\n    Bright overhead,\r\n  And the autumn leaves lie sleeping\r\n    Over the dead,\r\n  By the stream that runs forever,\r\n    Hurrying past,\r\n  'Neath the trees that bend and quiver\r\n    Wild in the blast;--\r\n  Deep in the wood he lieth,\r\n    Under the sod,\r\n  Where the wind of autumn sigheth,\r\n    Alone--with his God.\r\n\r\n                        E. W. C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great question of the hour is, that of rebuilding the edifice of the\r\nRepublic, which has been rudely shaken and partly thrown down by the\r\nrebellion. All patriotic hearts, in anticipation of the speedy close of\r\nthe war, are turned with intense interest to this important work.\r\nOpinions divide upon this as upon all other great subjects, and we have\r\ntwo antagonistic ideas, organizing their respective parties with\r\nreference to it. One party maintains that the rebellious States have\r\nforfeited all their rights, and can under no circumstances claim to be\r\nrecognized in their former relations, except on a re-admission into the\r\nUnion upon the terms prescribed by the Constitution for the admission of\r\nnew States. The other party denies that any of the States, as such, have\r\nforfeited, or can forfeit any of their rights, and maintains the duty of\r\nthe Federal Government to protect all the States in their constitutional\r\nintegrity, to put down the rebellion within them, and to restore to them\r\nthe republican forms which have been violently overthrown.\r\n\r\nIn each of these positions, there seems to be a combination of truth and\r\nerror. So long as any State is in a belligerent and treasonable\r\nattitude, disclaiming and repudiating her obligations under the\r\nConstitution, she is obviously not entitled to the benefits of the\r\nsystem which she thus assails and defies. The State being sustained in\r\nrebellion by its whole people, it is vain to say the Government can only\r\nregard the people as individuals, for these are the State, and must be\r\ntreated accordingly. But if, laying down her arms, or even after being\r\nconquered, a State returns to her allegiance, to reject her demands\r\nwould be to admit that secession had been effectual. It would be a\r\nrecognition of the validity, if not of the rightfulness of the movement\r\nwhich assumed to carry the State out of the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to maintain that the State is still legally in the\r\nUnion, even at the moment of violent treason, and is still entitled to\r\nclaim her position and rights as such, would be equally, if not more\r\nabsurd and injurious to the nation. It is argued, that if there be any\r\ntrue and loyal citizens in the State, however few, they are entitled to\r\nthe protection of the Federal Government, and the recognition of their\r\nState as a member of the Union. This doctrine is unreasonable and\r\nimpracticable. Any theory which would carry us to the absurd extreme of\r\nconstituting a State of an inconsiderable number of men,--the paltry\r\nminority of a large population--would not be more objectionable to the\r\ngood sense of the people, than irreconcilable with the fundamental\r\nprinciples of our complex government. Such a minority, however small,\r\nwould be entitled to the protection and to the highest favor of the\r\nGovernment; and if they could be built up into a power sufficiently\r\nstrong to maintain themselves in the State, then they would fairly be\r\nentitled to claim full recognition. If, by the legitimate exercise of\r\nits war powers, by the just restraint and punishment of treason, the\r\nFederal Government can establish the real political ascendency of the\r\nloyal part of the population, and thus actually restore the State\r\nGovernment on a fair and substantial basis, even though it be placed in\r\nthe hands of a present minority, it would be fully justified in\r\nrecognizing this organization as a member of the old Union. But to set\r\nup a mere sham, and pretend to rebuild a State on the basis of\r\ninconsiderable numbers, against even the disloyal sentiments of the\r\ngreat body of the people, would be unwise and unavailing. Such a\r\nreconstruction would be hollow and deceptive, a danger and a snare,\r\nforever threatening the tranquillity of the country.\r\n\r\nThe question is one of practical statesmanship; and the Government must\r\ndeal with it upon the principles of common sense, without embarrassing\r\nitself by any mere theories which would be troublesome and inapplicable\r\nin any emergency. How long after subjugation the Government will wait\r\nfor the return of any State to its allegiance, and what indications of\r\nsincere loyalty will be accepted, as well as what fair and honorable\r\ninducements will be held out to lure the erring population back into the\r\nfold of the Union, are matters for the gravest consideration, and can\r\nonly be determined when the occasion for decision shall arise. To thrust\r\na State back into the Union, and clothe it with all its former\r\nconstitutional privileges, while the masses of its people are still\r\nhostile to the Federal authority, would evince a degree of recklessness,\r\nand even insanity, which, it is to be hoped, the Government will never\r\nexhibit. But when a State is fit to return, and may properly and safely\r\nbe received, let her be welcomed cordially and heartily, without the\r\nleast reminiscence of her sad and disastrous error.\r\n\r\nThe true difficulty is not in the principle which is to control our\r\naction in any given circumstances. That is sufficiently plain in itself;\r\nit is only the application which is difficult. We cannot acknowledge the\r\nequality and sisterhood of a State, which, though subdued, is still\r\nhostile and not to be trusted in the Union: but we can and will receive\r\nall those which truly accept the result of the war and honestly return\r\nto their allegiance. We cannot create a State in the midst of a hostile\r\npopulation, and maintain the sovereign right of an inconsiderable few\r\nagainst the voice of the vast majority; but we can favor, encourage, and\r\nbuild up the loyal minority when that is sufficiently important, so as\r\nto make it the majority, and clothe it with the power of the\r\nresuscitated State.\r\n\r\nSo long as there is no loyal State authority fairly representing the\r\npeople, the State must be considered as disabled, and its rights _in\r\nabeyance_. There is no necessity of considering the State as\r\nextinguished, while there is hope of a favorable change. To reduce the\r\nStates to the condition of territories would be an act of extreme\r\nhostility, and could only be the ultimate result of incorrigible\r\ntreason, holding out against subjugation and against all the reasonable\r\ninducements which can be offered to a rebellious people by a magnanimous\r\nGovernment. We can never receive into the bosom of the Union a hostile\r\npeople, full of treason, and always ready for renewed mischief. Though\r\nthey be conquered in arms, we cannot compel their thoughts and\r\naffections. Unless they yield these, force cannot win them; and we must\r\ntherefore hold the rein of control for our own security. The act of\r\nrecognition will be always determined by the will of the Federal\r\nauthorities. This right of decision necessarily places in their hands\r\nthe supreme control of those conditions which are necessary to our\r\nfuture security.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar taint or infection which we call SCROFULA lurks in\r\nthe constitutions of multitudes of men. It either produces or is\r\nproduced by an enfeebled, vitiated state of the blood, wherein that\r\nfluid becomes incompetent to sustain the vital forces in their vigorous\r\naction, and leaves the system to fall into disorder and decay. The\r\nscrofulous contamination is variously caused by mercurial disease, low\r\nliving, disordered digestion from unhealthy food, impure air, filth and\r\nfilthy habits, the depressing vices, and, above all, by the venereal\r\ninfection. Whatever be its origin, it is hereditary in the constitution,\r\ndescending \"from parents to children unto the third and fourth\r\ngeneration;\" indeed, it seems to be the rod of Him who says, \"I will\r\nvisit the iniquities of the fathers upon their children.\" The diseases\r\nwhich it originates take various names, according to the organs it\r\nattacks. In the lungs, Scrofula produces tubercles, and finally\r\nConsumption; in the glands, swellings which suppurate and become\r\nulcerous sores; in the stomach and bowels, derangements which produce\r\nindigestion, dyspepsia, and liver complaints; on the skin, eruptive and\r\ncutaneous affections. These all having the same origin, require the same\r\nremedy, viz.: purification and invigoration of the blood. Purify the\r\nblood, and these dangerous distempers leave you. With feeble, foul, or\r\ncorrupted blood, you cannot have health; with that \"life of the flesh\"\r\nhealthy, you cannot have scrofulous disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AYER'S SARSAPARILLA~\r\n\r\nIs compounded from the most effectual antidotes that medical science has\r\ndiscovered for this afflicting distemper, and for the cure of the\r\ndisorders it entails. That it is far superior to any other remedy yet\r\ndevised, is known by all who have given it a trial. That it does combine\r\nvirtues truly extraordinary in their effect upon this class of\r\ncomplaints, is indisputably proven by the great multitude of publicly\r\nknown and remarkable cures it has made of the following diseases:\r\n~King's Evil or Glandular Swellings, Tumors, Eruptions, Pimples,\r\nBlotches and Sores, Erysipelas, Rose or St. Anthony's Fire, Salt Rheum,\r\nScald Head, Coughs from tuberculous deposits on the lungs, White\r\nSwellings, Debility, Dropsy, Neuralgia, Dyspepsia or Indigestion,\r\nSyphilis and Syphilitic Infections, Mercurial Diseases, Female\r\nWeaknesses~, and, indeed, the whole series of complaints that arise from\r\nimpurities of the blood. Minute reports of individual cases may be found\r\nin AYER'S AMERICAN ALMANAC, which is furnished to the druggists\r\nfor gratuitous distribution, wherein may be learned the directions for\r\nits use, and some of the remarkable cures which it has made when all\r\nother remedies had failed to afford relief. Those cases are purposely\r\ntaken from all sections of the country, in order that every reader may\r\nhave access to some one who can speak to him of its benefits from\r\npersonal experience. Scrofula depresses the vital energies, and thus\r\nleaves its victims far more subject to disease and its fatal results\r\nthan are healthy constitutions. Hence, it tends to shorten, and does\r\ngreatly shorten the average duration of human life. The vast importance\r\nof these considerations has led us to spend years in perfecting a remedy\r\nwhich is adequate to its cure. This we now offer to the public under the\r\nname of AYER'S SARSAPARILLA, although it is composed of\r\ningredients, some of which exceed the best of _Sarsaparilla_ in\r\nalterative power. By its aid you may protect yourself from the suffering\r\nand danger of these disorders. Purge out the foul corruptions that rot\r\nand fester in the blood; purge out the causes of disease, and vigorous\r\nhealth will follow. By its peculiar virtues this remedy stimulates the\r\nvital functions, and thus expels the distempers which lurk within the\r\nsystem or burst out on any part of it.\r\n\r\nWe know the public have been deceived by many compounds of\r\n_Sarsaparilla_ that promised much and did nothing; but they will neither\r\nbe deceived nor disappointed in this. Its virtues have been proven by\r\nabundant trial, and there remains no question of its surpassing\r\nexcellence for the cure of the afflicting diseases it is intended to\r\nreach. Although under the same name, it is a very different medicine\r\nfrom any other which has been before the people, and is far more\r\neffectual than any other which has ever been available to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AYER'S CHERRY PECTORAL~\r\n\r\nThe World's Great Remedy for Coughs, Colds, Incipient Consumption, and\r\nfor the relief of Consumptive patients in advanced stages of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThis has been so long used and so universally known, that we need do no\r\nmore than assure the public that its quality is kept up to the best it\r\never has been, and that it may be relied on to do all it has ever done.\r\n\r\nPrepared by Dr. J.

ALEXANDER CLARK, Editor of the School Visitor.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most thrilling accounts of adventure and suffering\r\nthat the war has produced. Capt. Geer was wounded and captured at\r\nthe great battle of Shiloh, tried before several prominent Rebel\r\nGenerals for his life, among whom were Hardee, Bragg, and\r\nBeauregard,--incarcerated in four jails, four penitentiaries, and twelve\r\nmilitary prisons; escaped from Macon, Georgia, and travelled barefoot\r\nthrough swamps and woods by night, for 250 miles, was fed by negroes in\r\npart, and subsisted for days at a time on frogs, roots, and berries, and\r\nwas at last recaptured when within thirty-five miles of our gunboats on\r\nthe Southern coast.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of his subsequent sufferings as a chained culprit are\r\ntold with a graphic truthfulness that surpasses any fiction.\r\n\r\nThe work contains a fine steel portrait of the author, besides numerous\r\nwood engravings illustrative of striking incidents of his experience\r\namong the rebels. Every Unionist--every lover of his country--every man,\r\nwoman, and child should read this BOOK OF FACTS AS THEY ACTUALLY\r\nOCCURRED.\r\n\r\nThe author has not only succeeded in making a narrative of exciting\r\ninterest, but has ingeniously interwoven in the book many original and\r\neloquent arguments in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war against\r\nRebellion and Oppression.\r\n\r\nJust published on fine white paper, and handsomely bound in cloth. 285\r\npages.\r\n\r\nAgents wanted in every county and township in the Union, to whom\r\nextraordinary inducements will be offered.\r\n\r\nSpecimen copies will be sent to any person for $1, postpaid, with\r\nparticulars to Agents.\r\n\r\n~NOTICES OF THE PRESS.~\r\n\r\n\"No narrative of personal adventure that has been published since the\r\nwar began, equals this in interest.

No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the\r\nCONTINENTAL was first established, it has during that time\r\nacquired a strength and a political significance elevating it to a\r\nposition far above that previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. In proof of which assertion we call attention to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity;_ and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,                    Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,                   Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,                Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,            Thirty-six dollars.\r\n                           PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, to be paid BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the\r\nPublisher_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00",
