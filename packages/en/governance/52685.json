The type, the embellishments, and the whole\r\ngetting up, are excellent.

The ports of the United States are, singularly enough,\r\nscattered round the whole of their boundaries. Besides those on the\r\nseaboard, there are many in the interior; on the northern lakes, and on\r\nthousands of miles of deep rivers. No nook in the country is at a\r\ndespairing distance from a market; and where the usual incentives to\r\nenterprise exist, the means of transport are sure to be provided, in the\r\nproportion in which they are wanted.\r\n\r\nEven in the south, where, the element of wages being lost, and the will\r\nof the labourer being lost with them, there are no adequate means of\r\nexecuting even the best-conceived enterprises,[1] more has been done\r\nthan could have been expected under the circumstances. The mail roads\r\nare still extremely bad. I found, in travelling through the Carolinas\r\nand Georgia, that the drivers consider themselves entitled to get on by\r\nany means they can devise: that nobody helps and nobody hinders them. It\r\nwas constantly happening that the stage came to a stop on the brink of a\r\nwide and a deep puddle, extending all across the road. The driver helped\r\nhimself, without scruple, to as many rails of the nearest fence as might\r\nserve to fill up the bottom of the hole, or break our descent into it.\r\nOn inquiry, I found it was not probable that either road or fence would\r\nbe mended till both had gone to absolute destruction.\r\n\r\nThe traffic on these roads is so small, that the stranger feels himself\r\nalmost lost in the wilderness. In the course of several days' journey,\r\nwe saw, (with the exception of the wagons of a few encampments,) only\r\none vehicle besides our own. It was a stage returning from Charleston.\r\nOur meeting in the forest was like the meeting of ships at sea. We asked\r\nthe passengers from the south for news from Charleston and Europe; and\r\nthey questioned us about the state of politics at Washington. The eager\r\nvociferation of drivers and passengers was such as is very unusual, out\r\nof exile. We were desired to give up all thoughts of going by the\r\neastern road to Charleston. The road might be called impassable; and\r\nthere was nothing to eat by the way. So we described a circuit, by\r\nCamden and Columbia.\r\n\r\nAn account of an actual day's journey will give the best idea of what\r\ntravelling is in such places. We had travelled from Richmond, Virginia,\r\nthe day before, (March 2nd, 1835,) and had not had any rest, when, at\r\nmidnight, we came to a river which had no bridge. The \"scow\" had gone\r\nover with another stage, and we stood under the stars for a long time;\r\nhardly less than an hour. The scow was only just large enough to hold\r\nthe coach and ourselves; so that it was thought safest for the\r\npassengers to alight, and go on board on foot. In this process, I found\r\nmyself over the ankles in mud. A few minutes after we had driven on\r\nagain, on the opposite side of the river, we had to get out to change\r\ncoaches; after which we proceeded, without accident, though very slowly,\r\ntill daylight. Then the stage sank down into a deep rut, and the horses\r\nstruggled in vain. We were informed that we were \"mired,\" and must all\r\nget out. I stood for some time to witness what is very pretty for once;\r\nbut wearisome when it occurs ten times a day. The driver carries an axe,\r\nas a part of the stage apparatus. He cuts down a young tree, for a\r\nlever, which is introduced under the nave of the sunken wheel; a log\r\nserving for a block. The gentleman passengers all help; shouting to the\r\nhorses, which tug and scramble as vigorously as the gentlemen. We ladies\r\nsometimes gave our humble assistance by blowing the driver's horn.\r\nSometimes a cluster of negroes would assemble from a neighbouring\r\nplantation; and in extreme cases, they would bring a horse, to add to\r\nour team. The rescue from the rut was effected in any time from a\r\nquarter of an hour to two hours. This particular 3rd of March, two hours\r\nwere lost by this first mishap. It was very cold, and I walked on alone,\r\nsure of not missing my road in a region where there was no other. When I\r\nhad proceeded two miles, I stopped and looked around me. I was on a\r\nrising ground, with no object whatever visible but the wild, black\r\nforest, extending on all sides as far as I could see, and the red road\r\ncut through it, as straight as an arrow, till it was lost behind a\r\nrising ground at either extremity. I know nothing like it, except a\r\nSalvator Rosa I once saw. The stage soon after took me up, and we\r\nproceeded fourteen miles to breakfast. We were faint with hunger; but\r\nthere was no refreshment for us. The family breakfast had been long\r\nover, and there was not a scrap of food in the house. We proceeded, till\r\nat one o'clock we reached a private dwelling, where the good woman was\r\nkind enough to provide dinner for us, though the family had dined. She\r\ngave us a comfortable meal, and charged only a quarter dollar each. She\r\nstands in all the party's books as a hospitable dame.\r\n\r\nWe had no sooner left her house than we had to get out to pass on foot a\r\nbridge too crazy for us to venture over it in the carriage. Half a mile\r\nbefore reaching the place where we were to have tea, the thorough-brace\r\nbroke, and we had to walk through a snow shower to the inn. We had not\r\nproceeded above a quarter of a mile from this place when the traces\r\nbroke. After this, we were allowed to sit still in the carriage till\r\nnear seven in the morning, when we were approaching Raleigh, North\r\nCarolina. We then saw a carriage \"mired\" and deserted by driver and\r\nhorses, but tenanted by some travellers who had been waiting there since\r\neight the evening before. While we were pitying their fate, our vehicle\r\nonce more sank into a rut. It was, however, extricated in a short time,\r\nand we reached Raleigh in safety.\r\n\r\nIt was worth undergoing a few travelling disasters to witness the skill\r\nand temper of the drivers, and the inexhaustible good-nature of the\r\npassengers. Men of business in any other part of the world would be\r\nvisibly annoyed by such delays as I have described; but in America I\r\nnever saw any gentleman's temper give way under these accidents. Every\r\none jumps out in a moment, and sets to work to help the driver; every\r\none has his joke, and, when it is over, the ladies are sure to have the\r\nwhole represented to them in its most amusing light. One driver on this\r\njourney seemed to be a novice, or in some way inferior in confidence to\r\nthe rest. A gentleman of our party chose to sit beside him on the box;\r\nand he declared that the driver shut his eyes when we were coming to a\r\nhole; and that when he called piteously on the passengers for help, it\r\nwas because we were taking aim at a deep rut. Usually, the confidence\r\nand skill of the drivers were equally remarkable. If they thought the\r\nstage more full than was convenient, they would sometimes try to alarm\r\nthe passengers, so as to induce some of them to remain for the next\r\nstage; and it happened two or three times that a fat passenger or two\r\nfell into the trap, and declined proceeding; but it was easy for the\r\nexperienced to see that the alarm was feigned. In such cases, after a\r\nsplash into water, in the dark, news would be heard from the box that\r\nwe were in the middle of a creek, and could not go a step, back or\r\nforward, without being overturned into the water. Though the assertion\r\nwas disproved the next minute, it produced its effect. Again, when the\r\nmoon was going down early, and the lamps were found to be, of course,\r\nout of order, and the gentlemen insisted on buying candles by the\r\nroad-side, and walking on in bad places, each with a tallow light in his\r\nhand, the driver would let drop that, as we had to be overturned before\r\ndawn, it did not much matter whether it was now or later. After this,\r\nthe stoutest of the company were naturally left behind at the next\r\nstopping-place, and the driver chuckled at the lightening of his load.\r\n\r\nAt the close of a troublesome journey in the south, we drew up, with\r\nsome noise, before a hotel, at three in the morning. The driver blew a\r\nblast upon an execrable horn. Nobody seemed stirring. Slaves are the\r\nmost slow-moving people in the world, except upon occasion.\r\n\r\n\"What sleepy folks they are here!\" exclaimed the driver.\r\n\r\nAnother blast on the horn, long and screeching.\r\n\r\n\"Never saw such people for sleeping. Music has no effect on 'em at all.\r\nI shall have to try fire-arms.\"\r\n\r\nAnother blast.\r\n\r\n\"We've waked the watchman, however. That's something done.\"\r\n\r\nAnother blast.\r\n\r\n\"Never knew such people. Why, Lazarus was far easier to raise.\"\r\n\r\nThe best testimony that I can bear to the skill with which travelling is\r\nconducted on such roads as these, and also in steam-boats, is the fact\r\nthat I travelled upwards of ten thousand miles in the United States, by\r\nland and water, without accident. I was twice nearly overturned; but\r\nnever quite.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen what the mail routes are like in the south; and I have\r\nmentioned that greater progress has been made in other means of\r\ntransport than might have been expected. I referred to the new\r\nrail-roads which are being opened in various directions. I saw few\r\ncircumstances in the south with which I was so well pleased. By the free\r\ncommunication which will thus be opened, much sectional prejudice will\r\nbe dispelled: the inferiority of slave to free labour will be the more\r\nspeedily brought home to every man's convictions; and new settlers,\r\nabhorring slavery, will come in and mix with the present population; be\r\nthe laws regarding labour what they may.\r\n\r\nThe only rail-roads completed in the south, when I was there, were the\r\nCharleston and Augusta one, two short ones in the States of Alabama and\r\nMississippi, and one of five miles from Lake Pontchartrain to New\r\nOrleans. There is likely to be soon a magnificent line from Charleston\r\nto Cincinnati; and the line from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York, is now\r\nalmost uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nThe quarter of an hour employed in reaching New Orleans from Lake\r\nPontchartrain was one of the most delightful seasons in all my travels.\r\nMy notion of a swamp was corrected for ever. It was the end of April;\r\nand the flowering reeds and tropical shrubs made the whole scene one gay\r\ngarden. It was odd to be passing through a gay garden on a rail-road.\r\nGreen cypress grew out of the clear water everywhere; and there were\r\nacres of blue and white iris; and a thousand rich, unknown blossoms\r\nwaving over the pools. A negro here and there emerged from a flowery\r\nthicket, pushing himself on a raft, or in a canoe, through the reeds.\r\nThe sluggish bayou was on one side; and here and there, a group of old\r\nFrench houses on the other. It was like skimming, as one does in dreams,\r\nover the meadows of Sicily, or the plains of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThat which may be seen on either hand of the Charleston and Augusta\r\nrail-road is scarcely less beautiful; but my journeys on it were by far\r\nthe most fatiguing of any I underwent in the country. The motion and the\r\nnoise are distracting. Whether this is owing to its being built on\r\npiles, in many places; whether the fault is in the ground or the\r\nconstruction, I do not know. Almost all the rail-road travelling in\r\nAmerica is very fatiguing and noisy. I was told that this was chiefly\r\nowing to the roads being put to use as soon as finished, instead of the\r\nwork being left to settle for some months. How far this is true, I do\r\nnot pretend to say. The rail-roads which I saw in progress were laid on\r\nwood instead of stone. The patentee discovered that wood settles after\r\nfrost more evenly than stone. The original cost, in the State of New\r\nYork, is about two thousand dollars per mile.\r\n\r\nOne great inconvenience of the American rail-roads is that, from wood\r\nbeing used for fuel, there is an incessant shower of large sparks,\r\ndestructive to dress and comfort, unless all the windows are shut; which\r\nis impossible in warm weather. Some serious accidents from fire have\r\nhappened in this way; and, during my last trip on the Columbia and\r\nPhiladelphia rail-road, a lady in the car had a shawl burned to\r\ndestruction on her shoulders; and I found that my own gown had thirteen\r\nholes in it; and my veil, with which I saved my eyes, more than could be\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\nMy first trip on the Charleston rail-road was more amusing than\r\nprosperous. The arrangements were scarcely completed, and the apparatus\r\nwas then in a raw state. Our party left Columbia at seven in the evening\r\nof the 9th of March, by stage, hoping to meet the rail-road train at\r\nBranchville, sixty miles from Columbia, at eleven the next morning, and\r\nto reach Charleston, sixty-two more, to dinner. Towards morning, when\r\nthe moon had set, the stage bumped against something; and the driver\r\ndeclared that he must wait for the day-spring, before he could proceed\r\nanother step. When the dawn brightened, we found that we had, as we\r\nsupposed, missed our passage by the train, for the sake of a stump about\r\ntwo inches above the ground. We hastened breakfast at Orangeburg; and\r\nwhen we got to Branchville, found we need have been in no hurry. The\r\ntrain had not arrived; and, some little accident having happened, we\r\nwaited for it till near two o'clock.\r\n\r\nI never saw an economical work of art harmonise so well with the\r\nvastness of a natural scene, as here. From the piazza of the house at\r\nBranchville, the forest fills the whole scene, with the rail-road\r\nstretching through it, in a perfectly straight line, to the vanishing\r\npoint. The approaching train cannot be seen so far off as this. When it\r\nappears, a black dot, marked by its wreath of smoke, it is impossible to\r\navoid watching it, growing and self-moving, till it stops before the\r\ndoor. I cannot draw; but I could not help trying to make a sketch of\r\nthis, the largest and longest perspective I ever saw. We were well\r\nemployed for two hours in basking in the sun, noting the\r\nmock-orange-trees before the house, the turkeys strutting, the robins\r\n(twice as large as the English) hopping and flitting; and the house,\r\napparently just piled up of wood just cut from the forest. Everything\r\nwas as new as the rail-road. As it turned out, we should have been\r\nbetter employed in dining; but we had no other idea than of reaching\r\nCharleston in three or four hours.\r\n\r\nFor the first thirty-five miles, which we accomplished by half-past\r\nfour, we called it the most interesting rail-road we had ever been on.\r\nThe whole sixty-two miles was almost a dead level, the descent being\r\nonly two feet. Where pools, creeks, and gullies had to be passed, the\r\nroad was elevated on piles, and thence the look down on an expanse of\r\nevergreens was beautiful. This is, probably, the reason why three\r\ngentlemen went, a few days afterwards, to walk, of all places, on the\r\nrail-road. When they were in the middle of one of these elevated\r\nportions, where there is a width of only about three inches on either\r\nside the tracks, they heard a shout, and looking back, saw a train\r\ncoming upon them with such speed as to leave no hope that it could be\r\nstopped before it reached them. There was no alternative; all three\r\nleaped down, upwards of twenty feet, into the swamp, and escaped with a\r\nwetting, and with looking exceedingly foolish in their own eyes.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four, our boiler sprang a leak, and there was an end of our\r\nprosperity. In two hours, we hungry passengers were consoled with the\r\nnews that it was mended. But the same thing happened, again and again;\r\nand always in the middle of a swamp, where we could do nothing but sit\r\nstill. The gentlemen tried to amuse themselves with frog-hunting: but it\r\nwas a poor resource. Once we stopped before a comfortable-looking house,\r\nwhere a hot supper was actually on the table; but we were not allowed to\r\nstop, even so long as to get out. The gentlemen made a rush into the\r\nhouse to see what they could get. One carried off a chicken entire, for\r\nhis party; another seized part of a turkey. Our gentlemen were not alert\r\nenough. The old lady's table was cleared too quickly for them, and\r\nquite to her own consternation. All that we, a party of five, had to\r\nsupport us, was some strips of ham, pieces of dry bread, and three sweet\r\npotatoes, all jumbled together in a handkerchief. Our thoughts wandered\r\nback to this supper-table, an hour after, when we were again sticking in\r\nthe middle of a swamp. I had fallen asleep, (for it was now the middle\r\nof a second night of travelling,) and was awakened by such a din as I\r\nhad never heard. I could not recollect where I was; I looked out of the\r\nwindow, and saw, by the light of the moon, white houses on the bank of\r\nthe swamp, and the waving shrubs of the forest; but the distracting din\r\nwas like nothing earthly. It presently struck me that we were being\r\ntreated with a frog-concert. It is worth hearing, for once, anything so\r\nunparalleled as the knocking, ticking, creaking, and rattling, in every\r\nvariety of key. The swamp was as thick of noises as the forest is of\r\nleaves: but, five minutes of the concert are enough; while a hundred\r\nyears are not enough of the forest. After many times stopping and\r\nproceeding, we arrived at Charleston between four and five in the\r\nmorning; and, it being too early to disturb our friends, crept cold and\r\nweary to bed, at the Planters' Hotel. It was well that all this happened\r\nin the month of March. Three months later, such detention in the swamps\r\nby night might have been the death of three-fourths of the passengers. I\r\nhave not heard of any mismanagement since the concern has been put\r\nfairly in operation.\r\n\r\nThere are many rail-roads in Virginia, and a line to New York, through\r\nMaryland and Delaware. There is in Kentucky a line from Louisville to\r\nLexington. But it is in Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, and\r\nMassachusetts, that they abound. All have succeeded so admirably, that\r\nthere is no doubt of the establishment of this means of communication\r\nover nearly the whole of the United States, within a few years, as\r\nby-ways to the great high-ways which Nature has made to run through this\r\nvast country. The evil of a superabundance of land in proportion to\r\nlabour will thus be lessened so far, that there will be an economy of\r\ntime, and a facility of intercourse, which will improve the intelligence\r\nof the country population. There will, also, be a facility of finding\r\nout where new supplies of labour are most wanted, and of supplying them.\r\nBy advantageous employment for small capitals being thus offered within\r\nbounds, it may also be hoped that many will be prevented from straying\r\ninto the wilderness. The best friends of the moral as well as economical\r\ninterests of the Americans, will afford all possible encouragement to\r\nwise schemes for the promotion of intercourse, especially between the\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\nI believe the best-constructed rail-road in the States is the Boston and\r\nLowell, Massachusetts: length, twenty-five miles. Its importance, from\r\nthe amount of traffic upon it, may be estimated from the fact that some\r\nthousands of dollars were spent, the winter after it was opened, in\r\nclearing away a fall of snow from it. It was again covered, the next\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnother line from Boston is to Providence, Rhode Island, forty-three\r\nmiles long. This opens a very speedy communication with New York; the\r\ndistance, two hundred and twenty-seven miles, being performed in twenty\r\nhours, by rail-road and steam-boat.\r\n\r\nThere is a good line from Boston to Worcester; forty-five miles in\r\nlength. Its estimated cost is 883,904 dollars. This road is to be\r\ncarried on across the entire State, to the Connecticut; from whence a\r\nline is now in course of construction to the Hudson, to issue opposite\r\nAlbany. There are proposals for a tunnel under the Hudson at Albany;\r\nand from Albany, there is already canal and rail-road communication to\r\nLake Erie. There is now an uninterrupted communication from the Atlantic\r\nto the far end of Lake Michigan. It only remains to extend a line thence\r\nto the Mississippi, and the circle is complete.\r\n\r\nThe great Erie canal, intersecting the whole State of New York, is too\r\ncelebrated to need much notice here. Its entire length is three hundred\r\nand sixty-three miles. It is forty feet wide at top, twenty-eight at\r\nbottom, and four feet deep. There are eighty-four locks on the main\r\ncanal. The total rise and fall is six hundred and ninety-two feet. The\r\ncost was 9,500,000 dollars. Though this canal has been opened only since\r\n1825, it is found already insufficient for the immense commerce carried\r\non between the European world and the great West, through the eastern\r\nports. There is a rail-road now running across the entire State, which\r\nis expected to exhibit much more traffic than the canal, without at all\r\ninterfering with its business.\r\n\r\nI traversed the valley of the Mohawk twice; the first time by the canal,\r\nthe next by stage, which I much preferred, both on account of the views\r\nbeing better from the high-road, and from the discomfort of the\r\ncanal-boats. I had also the opportunity of observing the courses of the\r\ncanal and the new rail-road throughout.\r\n\r\nI was amused, the first time, at hearing some gentlemen plan how the bed\r\nof the shoaly Mohawk might be deepened, so as to admit the passage of\r\nsteam-boats. It would be nearly as easy to dig a river at once for the\r\npurpose, and pump it full; in other words, to make another canal, twice\r\nas wonderful as the present. The rail-road is a better scheme by far. In\r\nwinter the traffic is continued by sleighs on the canal ice: and a\r\npretty sight it must be.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the valley was really beautiful last June. It must have\r\nmade the Mohawk Indians heart-sore to part with it in its former quiet\r\nstate; but now there is more beauty, as well as more life. There are\r\nfarms, in every stage of advancement, with all the stir of life about\r\nthem; and the still, green graveyard belonging to each, showing its\r\nwhite palings and tombstones on the hill-side, near at hand. Sometimes a\r\nsmall space in the orchard is railed in for this purpose. In a shallow\r\nreach of the river there was a line of cows wading through, to bury\r\nthemselves in the luxuriant pasture of the islands in the midst of the\r\nMohawk. In a deeper part, the chain ferry-boat slowly conveyed its\r\npassengers across. The soil of the valley is remarkably rich, and the\r\ntrees and verdure unusually fine. The hanging oak-woods on the ridge\r\nwere beautiful; and the knolls, tilled or untilled; and the little\r\nwaterfalls trickling or leaping down, to join the rushing river. Little\r\nknots of houses were clustered about the locks and bridges of the canal;\r\nand here and there a village, with its white church conspicuous, spread\r\naway into the middle of the narrow valley. The green and white canal\r\nboats might be seen stealing along under the opposite ridge, or issuing\r\nfrom behind a clump of elms or birches, or gliding along a graceful\r\naqueduct, with the diminished figures of the walking passengers seen\r\nmoving along the bank. On the other hand, the rail-road skirted the base\r\nof the ridge, and the shanties of the Irish labourers, roofed with turf,\r\nand the smoke issuing from a barrel at one corner, were so grouped as to\r\nlook picturesque, however little comfortable. In some of the narrowest\r\npasses of the valley, the high road, the rail-road, the canal, and the\r\nriver, are all brought close together, and look as if they were trying\r\nwhich could escape first into a larger space. The scene at Little Falls\r\nis magnificent, viewed from the road, in the light of a summers'\r\nmorning. The carrying the canal and rail-road through this pass was a\r\ngrand idea; and the solidity and beauty of the works are worthy of it.\r\n\r\nThe canal was commenced in 1817; and the first boat from the inland\r\nlakes arrived at New York on the 4th of November 1825. The first year's\r\nrevenue amounted to 566,221 dollars. In 1836, the tolls amounted to\r\n1,294,649 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe incorporated rail-road companies in the State of New York in 1836\r\nwere fifty; their capitals varying from fifteen thousand to ten million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWhen I first crossed the Alleghanies, in November 1834, I caught a\r\nglimpse of the stupendous Portage rail-road, running between the two\r\ncanals which reach the opposite bases of the mountains. The stage in\r\nwhich I travelled was on one side of a deep ravine, bristling with\r\npines; while on the other side was the lofty embankment, such a wall as\r\nI had never imagined could be built, on the summit of which ran the\r\nrail-road, its line traceable for some miles, with frequent stations and\r\ntrains of baggage-cars. One track of this road had not long been opened;\r\nand the work was a splendid novelty. I had afterwards the pleasure of\r\ntravelling on it, from end to end.\r\n\r\nThis road is upwards of thirty-six miles in length, and at one point\r\nreaches an elevation of 2,491 feet above the sea. It consists of eleven\r\nlevels, and ten inclined planes. About three hundred feet of the road,\r\nat the head and foot of each plane, is made exactly level. The\r\nembankments were made twenty-five feet wide at the top, and the bed of\r\nthe road in excavations is twenty-five feet, with wide side ditches.\r\nMuch care in drainage was necessary, as the road passes chiefly along\r\nthe steep slopes of hills, of clayey soil, and over innumerable small\r\nstreams. Sixty-eight culverts of masonry pass under the road, and\r\neighty-five drains. There are four viaducts of hammer-dressed sandstone,\r\nto carry the line over streams. The most splendid of these is over the\r\nConemaugh, eight miles from Johnstown. It has a semi-circular arch of\r\neighty feet span; the top of whose masonry is seventy feet above the\r\nwater. There is a tunnel through a spur of the Alleghany, nine hundred\r\nand one feet long, by twenty feet wide, and nineteen high. The\r\nfoundations of this road are partly stone and partly wood. Each station\r\nhas two steam-engines; one being used at a time, and the other provided\r\nto prevent delay, in case of accident. Four cars, each loaded with 7000\r\nlbs. can be drawn up, and four such let down at a time; and from six to\r\nten such trips can be accomplished in an hour. A safety-car is attached\r\nto the train, both in ascending and descending; and though not an\r\nabsolute safeguard, it much increases the security. This little machine,\r\nwhen pressed upon from behind, grounds its point, and materially checks\r\nthe velocity of the otherwise flying train. The iron rails, and some\r\nother of the metal portions of the work, were imported from Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe cost of constructing this rail-road at the contract prices was\r\n1,634,357 dollars; but this does not include office expenses, or\r\nengineering, or accidental extra allowances to contractors. During the\r\nfirst year of the two tracks being opened, fifty thousand tons of\r\nfreight, and twenty thousand passengers, passed over the road.\r\n\r\nFive years before, this line of passage was an untrodden wilderness. The\r\nact authorising the commencement of the work passed the Pennsylvania\r\nlegislature on the 21st of March, 1831. On the 12th of the next month,\r\nthe tents of the first working party were pitched at the head of the\r\nmountain-branch of the Conemaugh. The party consisted of two engineers,\r\na surveyor, twelve assistants and axemen, and a cook. A track, one\r\nhundred and twenty feet wide, overgrown with heavy spruce and hemlock\r\ntimber, had to be cleared, for a distance of thirty miles. The amount of\r\nlabour was increased as the work proceeded; and, at one time, as many as\r\ntwo thousand men were employed upon the road. On the 26th of November,\r\n1833, the first car traversed the whole length on the single track that\r\nwas finished. The canals were then closed for the season; but, during\r\nthe next March the road was opened for a public highway. In another year\r\nthe enterprise was completed; and in May 1835, the State furnished the\r\nwhole motive power. The stupendous work was then in full operation.\r\n\r\nOur party (of four, one a child) traversed the entire State from\r\nPittsburg to Philadelphia by canal and rail-road, in four days, at an\r\nexpense of only forty-two dollars, not including provisions. There was\r\nthen great competition between the lines of canal-boats. We went by the\r\nnew line, whose boats were extraordinarily clean, and the table really\r\nluxurious. An omnibus, sent from the canal, conveyed us from our hotel\r\nat Pittsburg to the boat, at nine in the evening; and we immediately set\r\noff. Berths were put up for the ladies of the party in the ladies'\r\ndressing-room, and removed during the day. We were called early, and\r\nbreakfast dispatched before the heat grew oppressive; but, though it was\r\nnow the middle of July, I could not remain in the shade of the cabin:\r\nthe scenery, during our whole course, was so beautiful. Umbrella and\r\nfan made the heat endurable on deck, except for the two hours nearest to\r\nnoon. The only great inconvenience was the having to remember\r\nperpetually to avoid the low bridges, which we passed, on an average,\r\nevery quarter of an hour. When we were all together, this was little of\r\nan annoyance; for one or another was sure to remember to give warning;\r\nbut a solitary person, reading or in reverie, is really in danger. We\r\nheard of two cases of young ladies, reading, who had been crushed to\r\ndeath: and we prohibited books upon deck. Charley thought the commotion\r\ncaused on our approach to a bridge the best part of our amusement; and\r\nhe was heard to complain sometimes that it was very long since we had\r\nhad any bridges, or when one chanced to be so lofty that we might pass\r\nunder it without stooping. The best of all in his eyes were the\r\nhorizontal ones, which compelled us to lie down flat.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Kiskiminites is like one noble, fruitful park. Here\r\nand there were harvest fields of small grain, and of the tasselled\r\nIndian corn: and a few coal and salt works, some forsaken, some busy,\r\nshowed themselves on reaches of the river; but we were usually enclosed\r\nby a circle of wooded hills, reposing in the brightest lights and\r\nshadows. The canal commonly ran along the base of one of these hills;\r\nbut it often let us slip into the broad lucid stream of the river\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAfter having left the Kiskiminites behind us, we crossed the Conemaugh\r\nby a fine aqueduct, which continued its course through a long dark\r\ntunnel, piercing the heart of the mountain. The reflection of the blue\r\nlight behind us on the straight line of water in this cavern made a\r\nbeautiful picture. The paths which human hands have piled upon one\r\nanother here form a singular combination: the river below, the aqueduct\r\nover it; and higher still, the mountain road, winding steeper and\r\nsteeper to the summit. A settler lives on this mountain, the bottom of\r\nwhose well was dug out in making the tunnel. In the evening there was\r\nevery combination of rock, hill, wood, river, and luxuriant vegetation\r\nthat could furnish forth a succession of noble pictures. Charley was as\r\nwell amused as the rest of us. He understood the construction and\r\nmanagement of the locks, and was never tired of our rising and falling\r\nin them; and they afforded, besides, an opportunity of stepping ashore\r\nwith his father, to get us flowers, and run along the bank to the next\r\nlock. Of these locks there are a hundred and ninety-two between\r\nPittsburg and Philadelphia, averaging eight feet in depth.\r\n\r\nWe were called up before four on the second morning, and had barely time\r\nto dress, step ashore, and take our places in the car, before the train\r\nset off. We understood that the utmost possible advantage is taken of\r\nthe daylight, as the trains do not travel after dark; it being made a\r\npoint of, that the ropes should be examined before each trip. After\r\nhaving breakfasted by the way, we reached the summit of the Portage\r\nrail-road between nine and ten. There were fine views all the way; the\r\nmountains opening and receding, and disclosing the distant clearings and\r\nnestling villages. All around us were plots of wild flowers, of many\r\nhues.\r\n\r\nWe were carried on chiefly by steam power, partly by horse, partly by\r\ndescending weight, and, at the last, down a long reach, of the slightest\r\npossible inclination, by our own weight. The motion was then\r\ntremendously rapid, and it subsided only on our reaching the canal at\r\nthe foot of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThere was again so much hurry--there being danger of either of two rival\r\nboats getting first possession of the next locks, that we of the last\r\ncar had scarcely time to step on board before the team of three horses\r\nbegan cantering and raising a dust on the towing path, and tugging us\r\nthrough the water at such a rate as to make the waves lash the canal\r\nbank. Our boat won the race, and we bolted with a victorious force into\r\nthe chamber of the first lock.\r\n\r\nWe had occasionally to cross broad rivers. To-day we crossed the\r\nJuniatta by a rope ferry, moved by water-power; and afterwards we\r\ncrossed the Susquehanna (at the junction of two branches of the\r\nJuniatta, the Susquehanna, and two canals) by means of the towing-path\r\nbeing carried along the outside of the great covered bridge which spans\r\nthe river at Duncan's Island.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we had to leave the broad, clear, but shallow\r\nSusquehanna,--the \"river of rocks,\" as its name imports. I had before\r\ntravelled almost its whole length along its banks; and, like every one\r\nwho has done so, loved its tranquil beauty.\r\n\r\nThe last stage of this remarkable journey was from Columbia to\r\nPhiladelphia, by rail-road, eighty-one miles, which we were seven hours\r\nin performing, as the stoppages were frequent and long. This work, which\r\nwas opened in 1834, includes thirty-one viaducts, seventy-three stone\r\nculverts, five hundred stone drains, and eighteen bridges. Its cost was\r\nabout 1,600,000 dollars.--The length of this passage from Philadelphia\r\nto Pittsburg is 394 miles.\r\n\r\nWhere, I again ask, would have been these great works, but for the\r\nimmigration so seriously complained of by some?\r\n\r\nThe number of considerable canals, varying in length from fourteen to\r\nthree hundred and sixty-three miles, was, in 1835, twenty-five. Of\r\nrail-roads, from fifteen to a hundred and thirty-two miles long, there\r\nwere fourteen. The cost of these canals was 64,573,099 dollars. The cost\r\nof these rail-roads was nearly thirty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch are the best people to apply to for capital when any canal\r\nwork is projected. I heard it said that the word \"canal\" was enough for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe steam-boats of the United States are renowned, as they deserve to\r\nbe. There is no occasion to describe their size and beauty here; but\r\ntheir number is astonishing. I understand that three hundred were\r\nnavigating the great western rivers some time ago: and the number is\r\nprobably much increased.\r\n\r\nAmong so many, and where the navigation is so dangerous as on the\r\nMississippi, it is no wonder that the accidents are numerous. I was\r\nrather surprised at the cautions I received throughout the south about\r\nchoosing wisely among the Mississippi steam-boats; and at the question\r\ngravely asked, as I was going on board, whether I had a life-preserver\r\nwith me. I found that all my acquaintances on board had furnished\r\nthemselves with life-preservers; and my surprise ceased when we passed\r\nboat after boat on the river, delayed or deserted on account of some\r\naccident. We were on board the \"Henry Clay,\" a noble boat, of high\r\nreputation; the present being the ninety-seventh trip accomplished\r\nwithout accident. Our yawl was snagged one day; and we encountered a\r\nsquall and hail storm, one night, which blew both the pilots away from\r\nthe helm, and made them look \"to see the hurricane deck blown clear\r\noff;\" but no mischief ensued.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the increase of steam-boats in the Mississippi, flat\r\nboats are still much in use. These are large boats, of rude\r\nconstruction, made just strong enough to hold together, and keep their\r\ncargo of flour, or other articles, dry, from some high point on the\r\ngreat rivers, to New Orleans. They are furnished with two enormous oars,\r\nfixed on what is, I suppose, called their deck; to be used where the\r\ncurrent is sluggish, or when it is desirable to change the direction of\r\nthe boat. The cumbrous machine is propelled by the stream; her\r\nproprietors only occasionally helping her progress, now by pulling at\r\nthe branches of overhanging trees, now by turning her into the more\r\nrapid of two currents. She is seen sometimes floating down the very\r\nmiddle of the river; sometimes gliding under the banks. At noon, a bower\r\nof green leaves is waving on her deck, for shade to her masters; at\r\nnight, a pine brand is waved, flaming, to give warning to the\r\nsteam-boats not to run her down. The voyage from the upper parts of the\r\nOhio to New Orleans, is thus performed in from three to five weeks. The\r\ncargo being disposed of at New Orleans, the boat is broken up, and the\r\nmaterials sold; and her masters work their way home again, as deck\r\npassengers on board a steam-boat, by bringing in wood at all the wooding\r\nplaces. The \"Henry Clay\" had a larger company of this kind of passengers\r\nthan the captain liked. He declared that the deck was giving way under\r\ntheir number. It was a pretty sight to see them twice a day,--very early\r\nin the morning, and about sunset,--pour from the boat, when she drew\r\nunder the shore, form two lines between the boat and the wood pile, and\r\nbring in their loads. Most of them were tall Kentuckians, who really do\r\nlook unlike all other people. I felt a strong inclination for a\r\nflat-boat voyage down the vast and beautiful Mississippi; beautiful with\r\nislands and bluffs, and the eternal forest; but I have lost the\r\nopportunity. If I should ever visit that beloved country again, this\r\npicturesque kind of craft will have disappeared, as the yet more\r\nbarbarous raft is now disappearing; and one more characteristic feature\r\nof western scenery will be effaced.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that there will be a more rapid increase of ships and\r\nschooners than of steam-boats on the northern lakes. These lakes are so\r\nsubject to gusts and storms that steam-boats cannot be considered safe,\r\nand ought to make no promises of punctuality. The captains declare their\r\noffice to be too anxious a one. A squall comes from any quarter, without\r\nnotice; and the boat no sooner seems to be proceeding prosperously on\r\nher way, than she has to run in somewhere for safety from a sudden\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nOf all the water-craft I ever saw, I know none so graceful as the sloops\r\non the Hudson; unless it be the New York pilot-boats. The North-River\r\nsloops are an altogether peculiar race of boats. They are low, and can\r\ncarry a great press of sail, from the smoothness of the water on which\r\nthey perform their voyages. A sloop of a hundred and fifty tons will\r\ncarry a mast of ninety feet high. I could watch these boats on the\r\nHudson, a whole summer through; moored beside a pebbly strand, in a\r\nrecess of the shore; or lying dark in a trail of glittering sunshine; or\r\nturning the whitest of sails to the sun, startling the fish-hawk with\r\nthe sudden gleam, so that he quits his prey, and makes for the hanging\r\nwoods. I saw their graceful forms disclosed by lightning, while I was\r\nwatching, from the piazza of the West Point Hotel, the progress of a\r\ntremendous storm. I saw them as suddenly disclosed at another time; and\r\nstill more strikingly. From the terrace of Pine Orchard House, on the\r\nsummit of the Catskill Mountain, I watched, one July morning, at four\r\no'clock, the breaking of the dawn over the entire valley of the Hudson.\r\nThe difference between mountain, forest, and meadow, first appeared.\r\nThen the grey river seemed to grow into sight, for the whole length of\r\nits windings. It was twelve miles off, and looked little more than a\r\nthread. The sun came up, like a golden star resting on the mountain-top;\r\nand, on the instant, the river was seen to be peopled with these sloops.\r\nTheir white sails came in one instant into view, together with the\r\nchurches in the hamlets, and the bright gables of the farm-houses in the\r\nmeadows. The whole scene was made alive by one ray.\r\n\r\nThere will be no want of markets for produce of all kinds, in the United\r\nStates, within any time that can be foreseen. If slavery were to be\r\nabolished to-morrow, and, in consequence, more corn grown and cattle\r\nreared in the slave States, the demand for both from the north-western\r\nStates would still go on to increase; so vast and progressive would be\r\nthe improvement in the south. The great cities are even yet ill supplied\r\nfrom the country. Provisions are very dear; and the butcher's meat\r\nthroughout the country is far inferior to what it will be when an\r\nincreased amount of labour, and means of transport, shall encourage\r\nimprovement in the pasturage and care of stock. While, as we have seen,\r\nfowls, butter, and eggs, are still sent from Vermont into Boston, there\r\nis no such thing to be had there as a joint of tender meat. In one house\r\nat Boston, where a very numerous family lives in handsome style, and\r\nwhere I several times met large dinner parties, I never saw an ounce of\r\nmeat, except ham. The table was covered with birds, in great variety,\r\nand well cooked; but all winged creatures. The only tender, juicy meat I\r\nsaw in the country, was a sirloin of beef at Charleston, and the whole\r\nprovision of a gentleman's table in Kentucky. At one country place,\r\nthere was nothing but veal on the table for a month; in a town where I\r\nstaid ten days, nothing was to be had but beef: and throughout the south\r\nthe traveller meets little else than pork, under all manner of\r\ndisguises, and fowls.\r\n\r\nMuch is said in England about the cheapness of living in the United\r\nStates, without its being understood what need there is of equalising,\r\n(or what appears so to the inhabitants of an old country,) by means of\r\nmarkets. In places where beef and veal are twopence per pound, and\r\nvenison a penny, (English,) tea may be twenty shillings per pound, and\r\ngloves seven shillings a pair. At Charlottesville University, fowls were\r\nprovided to the professors' families at a dollar a dozen. In the towns\r\nof Kentucky, meat is fourpence per pound; in the rural parts of\r\nPennsylvania a penny or twopence; and butter sixpence. At Ebensburg, on\r\nthe top of the Alleghanies, we staid twenty-five hours. Two of us were\r\nwell taken care of, had attendance, good beds, two dinners each, supper,\r\nbreakfast, and a supply of buns to carry away with us; and all for one\r\ndollar; the dollar at that time being four shillings and twopence\r\nEnglish. The next week, I paid six dollars for the making of a gown at\r\nPhiladelphia; and all the ladies of a country town, not very far off,\r\nwere wearing gloves too bad to be mended, or none at all, because none\r\nhad come up by the canal for many weeks.\r\n\r\nAt Washington, I wanted some ribbon for my straw bonnet; and, in the\r\nwhole place, in the season, I could find only six pieces of ribbon to\r\nchoose from.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire country, (out of the cities,) I was struck with\r\nthe discomfort of broken windows which appeared on every side. Large\r\nfarm-houses, flourishing in every other respect, had dismal-looking\r\nwindows. I was possessed with the idea that the business of a\r\ntravelling glazier would be a highly profitable one. Persons who happen\r\nto live near a canal, or other quiet watery road, have baskets of glass\r\nof various sizes sent to them from the towns, and glaze their own\r\nwindows. But there is no bringing glass over a corduroy, or mud, or\r\nrough limestone road; and those who have no other highways must \"get\r\nalong\" with such windows as it may please the weather and the children\r\nto leave them.\r\n\r\nThe following laconic dialogue shows, not unfairly, even if it be a mere\r\njest, how acceptable means of transport would be to western settlers.\r\n\r\n\"Whose land was this that you bought?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mogg's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the soil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the climate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you get to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you build your house of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Logs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any neighbours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frogs.\"\r\n\r\nThere are only two methods (besides rare accidents) by which dwellers in\r\nsuch places can get their wants supplied. When a few other neighbours\r\nbesides frogs, gather round the settler, some one opens a grocery store.\r\nI went shopping near the Falls of Niagara; about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom which place, there is a store on the borders of the forest. I saw\r\nthere glass and bacon; stay-laces, prints, drugs, rugs, and crockery;\r\nbombazeens and tin cans; books, boots, and moist sugar, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nPedlars are the other agents of supply. It has been mentioned how bibles\r\nand other books are sold by youths who adopt this method of speedily\r\nraising money. The Yankee pedlars, with their wooden clocks, are\r\nrenowned. One of these gentry lately retired with a fortune of a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, made by the sale of wooden clocks alone. These men are\r\ngreat benefactors to society: for, be their clocks what they may, they\r\nmake the country people as well off as the inhabitants of towns, in the\r\nmatter of knowing the time; and what more would they have? One would\r\nthink there was no sun in the United States, so very imaginative are\r\nmost of the population in respect of the hour. Even in New York I found\r\na wide difference between the upper and lower parts of the city: and\r\nbetween Canandaigua and Buffalo there was the slight variation of half\r\nan hour. In some parts of the south, we were at the mercy of whatever\r\nclock the last pedlar might have happened to bring, for the appearance\r\nof meals: but it appeared as if the clocks themselves had something of\r\nthe Yankee spirit in them; for, while they were usually too fast, I\r\nrarely knew one too slow.\r\n\r\nThe perplexity about time took a curious form in one instance, in the\r\nsouth. The lady of the governor of the State had never had sufficient\r\nenergy to learn the clock. With both clock and watch in the house, she\r\nwas incessantly sending her slave Venus, (lazy, ignorant, awkward, and\r\nugly,) into a neighbour's house to ask the hour. Three times in one\r\nmorning did Venus loll against the drawing-room door, her chin in her\r\nhands, drawling,\r\n\r\n\"What's the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nine, Venus.\"\r\n\r\nVenus went home, and told her mistress it was one. Dinner was hastened;\r\nbut it soon appearing from some symptom that it could not be so late,\r\nVenus appeared again, with her chin reposing as before.\r\n\r\n\"What's the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between ten and eleven, Venus.\"\r\n\r\nVenus carries word that it is eight. And so on.\r\n\r\nThe race of pedlars will decrease, year by year. There will be fewer\r\ncarts, nicely packed with boxes and baskets. There will be fewer youths\r\nin homespun, with grave faces and somewhat prim deportment, in\r\nwell-laden gigs. There will be fewer horsemen, with saddle-bags, and\r\ncompact wooden cases. There will be fewer pedestrians, with pouches\r\nstrung before and behind, an umbrella in one hand, and an open book in\r\nthe other. The same men, or their sons, will gain in fortune, and lose\r\nperhaps somewhat in mind and manners, by being stationary, or the\r\nfrequenters of some established market.\r\n\r\nThe conveying of vast quantities of cotton and other produce towards the\r\nsouthern ports is already a matter of pride to the residents, who boast\r\nthat they employ the industry of persons a thousand miles off to provide\r\nfood for themselves and their dependents. The bustle of the great\r\nnorthern markets is also very striking to the stranger who sees to what\r\ndistance in the interior, the produce of Europe and Asia is to be\r\nconveyed. But, a few years hence, the spread of comfort and luxury will\r\nbe as great as that of industry is now. By a vast augmentation of the\r\nmeans of transport, markets will be opened wherever the soil is\r\npeculiarly rich, the mines remarkably productive, or the locality\r\nespecially inviting.\r\n\r\nThe object is an all-important one. As it is too late to restrict the\r\nterritory on which the American people are dispersed, it is most\r\nserviceable that they should be brought together again, for purposes of\r\nintercourse, mutual education and discipline, and wise co-operation in\r\nthe work of self-government, by such means as exist for practically\r\nannihilating time and space. The certain increase of wealth by these\r\nmeans is a good. The certain increase of people is an incalculably\r\ngreater. The certain increase of knowledge and civilisation is the\r\ngreatest of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important constitutional questions that has arisen in\r\nthe United States is one, regarding Internal Improvements, which has\r\ngrown out of a failure of foresight in the makers of the constitution.\r\nNo set of men could be expected to foresee every great question which\r\nmust arise during the advancement of a young country; and there is no\r\nevidence of its having occurred to any one, in the early days of the\r\nrepublic, to inquire whether the general government should have power to\r\ninstitute and carry on public works, all over the States; and under what\r\nlimitations. Many inconsistent and contradictory proceedings have taken\r\nplace in Congress, since the question was first raised; and it remains\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\nFor some years after the Revolution, the treasury had enough to do to\r\npay the debts of the war, and defray the expenses attendant upon the\r\norganisation of the new system. As soon as a surplus was found to be in\r\nhand, suggestions were heard about improving the country. In 1796, Mr.\r\nMadison proposed a resolution to cause a survey to be made for a road\r\nfrom north to south, through all the Atlantic States. No appropriation\r\nwas made for the purpose: but no objection was offered on the ground of\r\nthe general government not having power to make such appropriation. The\r\ndifficulty of access to the great western wilderness was represented to\r\nCongress under Mr. Jefferson's administration, in 1802; and a law was\r\npassed, making appropriations for opening roads in the north-west\r\nterritory. This was the first appropriation made by Congress for\r\npurposes of internal improvement. Many similar acts followed; and\r\nroad-making and surveying the coast went on expeditiously, and to a\r\ngreat extent. In 1807, Mr. Gallatin prepared the celebrated Report to\r\nthe Senate, which contains a systematic plan for the improvement of the\r\nwhole country. In 1812, during Mr. Madison's administration, a survey\r\nwas authorised of the main post road from Maine to Georgia. Improvement\r\nunder the sanction of Congress went on with increased activity into the\r\nadministration of Mr. Monroe, by whom the first check was given. Mr.\r\nMonroe vetoed the bill authorising the collection of tolls for the\r\nrepair of the Cumberland road. The reason assigned for the veto was,\r\nthat it was one thing to make appropriations for public works, and\r\nanother thing to assume jurisdiction and sovereignty over the soil on\r\nwhich such works were erected; and President Monroe did not believe that\r\nCongress could assume power to levy toll.[2] By his adoption of a\r\nsubsequent act, involving the same principles, however, it seemed that\r\nhe had changed his opinion, or resolved to yield the question.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Q. Adams's advocacy of internal improvements removed some\r\nlingering difficulties; and, while he was President, the public works\r\nwere carried on with great activity. The southern members of Congress,\r\nhowever, were generally opposed to the exercise of this power by the\r\ngeneral government: and it has ever since been a strongly-debated\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson's course on the subject has not been very consistent.\r\nBefore his election, he always voted for internal improvements, going so\r\nfar as to advocate subscriptions by government to the stock of private\r\ncanal companies, and the formation of roads beginning and ending within\r\nthe limits of particular States. In his message at the opening of the\r\nfirst Congress after his accession, he proposed the division of the\r\nsurplus revenue among the States, as a substitute for the promotion of\r\ninternal improvements by the general government. He attempted a\r\nlimitation and distinction too difficult and important to be settled and\r\nacted upon on the judgment and knowledge of one man;--a distinction\r\nbetween general and local objects. It is manifestly impossible to draw\r\nthe line with any precision. The whole Union is benefited by the Erie\r\ncanal, though it lies wholly within the limits of the State of New York;\r\nand a thousand positions of circumstances may be imagined by which local\r\nadvantages may become general, and general local, so as to confound the\r\nlimitation altogether. At any rate, the judgment and knowledge of any\r\nindividual, or any cabinet, are obviously unequal to the maintenance of\r\nsuch a distinction.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 and 1830, the President advocated such an amendment of the\r\nconstitution as would authorise Congress to apply the surplus revenue to\r\ncertain specified objects, involving the general good; and he strongly\r\nobjected to the general government exercising a power, considered by\r\nhim unconstitutional, merely because there was a quantity of money in\r\nthe treasury which must be disposed of. He has since changed his\r\nopinion, and believes that less evil would be incurred by even suddenly\r\nreducing the revenue to the amount of the wants of the government, than\r\nby conferring on the general government immense means of patronage, and\r\nopportunity for corrupt and wasteful expenditure.\r\n\r\nThese changes of opinion in President Jackson prove nothing so clearly\r\nas the great difficulty of the subject. It is, however, so pressing and\r\nso important that, notwithstanding its difficulty, it must be settled\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\nThe opposing arguments seem to me to be these.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of a concession to Congress of the power of conducting\r\ninternal improvements plead, with regard to the constitutionality of the\r\npower, that it is conferred by the clauses which authorise Congress to\r\nmake post-roads: to regulate commerce between the States: to make and\r\ncarry on war; (and therefore to have roads by which to transport\r\ntroops;) to lay taxes, to pay the debts, and provide for the general\r\nwelfare of the United States: and to pass all laws necessary to carry\r\ninto effect its constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that to derive from these clauses any countenance of the\r\npractice of spending without limit the public funds, for objects which\r\nany present government may declare to be for the general welfare, is an\r\nobvious straining of the instrument: that, by such methods, the\r\nconstitution may be made to authorise the spending of any amount\r\nwhatever, for any purpose whatever: that it is the characteristic of the\r\nconstitution to specify the powers given to Congress with a nicety which\r\nis wholly inconsistent with such a boundless conveyance of power as is\r\nhere presumed: and that, accordingly, the permission to lay taxes, to\r\npay the debts, and provide for the general welfare of the United States,\r\nis limited as to its objects by the preceding specifications: and that,\r\nfinally, the powers allotted to the State governments exclude the\r\nsupposition that Congress is authorised to assume such territorial\r\njurisdiction as it has been allowed to practise within the limits of the\r\nseveral States.\r\n\r\nThis last set of opinions appears to disinterested observers so\r\nobviously reasonable, that the wonder is how so weak a stand on the\r\nprovisions of the constitution can have been maintained for any length\r\nof time. The reason is, that the pleas of expediency are so strong as to\r\ncounterbalance the weakness of the constitutional argument. But, this\r\nbeing the case, the truly honest and patriotic mode of proceeding would\r\nbe to add to the constitution by the means therein provided; instead of\r\nstraining the instrument to accomplish an object which was not present\r\nto the minds of its framers.\r\n\r\nThe pleas of the advocates of Internal Improvements are these: that very\r\nextensive public works, designed for the benefit of the whole Union, and\r\ncarried through vast portions of its area, must be accomplished: that an\r\nobject so essential ought not to be left at the mercy of such an\r\naccident as the cordial agreement of the requisite number of States, to\r\ncarry such works forward to their completion; that the surplus funds\r\naccruing from the whole nation cannot be so well employed as in\r\npromoting works by which the whole nation will be benefited: and that,\r\nas the interests of the majority have hitherto upheld Congress in the\r\nuse of this power, it may be assumed to be the will of the majority that\r\nCongress should continue to exercise it.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that it is inexpedient to put a vast and increasing\r\npatronage into the hands of the general government: that only a very\r\nsuperficial knowledge can be looked for in members of Congress as to the\r\nnecessity or value of works proposed to be instituted in any parts of\r\nthe States but those in which they are respectively interested: that\r\nendless jealousies would arise between the various States,[3] from the\r\nimpossibility or undesirableness of equalising the amount of\r\nappropriation made to each: that useless works would be proposed from\r\nthe spirit of competition, or individual interest:[4] and that\r\ncorruption, co-extensive with the increase of power, would deprave the\r\nfunctions of the general government.\r\n\r\nThere is much truth on both sides here. In the first set of pleas there\r\nis so much force that they have ceased to be, what they were once\r\nsupposed, the distinctive doctrines of the federal party. Mr. Webster is\r\nstill considered the head of the Internal Improvements party; and Mr.\r\nCalhoun was for some time the leader of its opponents. Jefferson's\r\nlatest opinions were strong against the power claimed and exercised by\r\nCongress. Yet large numbers of the democratic party are as strenuous\r\nfor internal improvements as Adams and Webster themselves; the interests\r\nof the majority being clearly on that side.\r\n\r\nTo an impartial observer it appears that Congress has no constitutional\r\nright to devote the public funds to internal improvements, at its own\r\nunrestricted will and pleasure: that the permitted usurpation of the\r\npower for so long a time indicates that some degree of such power in the\r\nhands of the general government is desirable and necessary: that such\r\npower should be granted through an amendment of the constitution, by the\r\nmethods therein provided: that, in the mean time, it is perilous that\r\nthe instrument should be strained for the support of any function,\r\nhowever desirable its exercise may be.\r\n\r\nIn case of the proposed addition being made to the constitution,\r\narrangements will, of course, be entered into for determining the\r\nprinciples by which general are to be distinguished from local objects,\r\nor whether such distinction can, on any principle, be fixed; for testing\r\nthe utility of proposed objects; for checking extravagant expenditure,\r\njobbing, and corrupt patronage: in short, the powers of Congress will be\r\nspecified, here, as in other matters, by express permission and\r\nprohibition. These details, difficult or unmanageable amidst the\r\nquestionable exercise of a great power, will, doubtless, be arranged so\r\nas to work with precision, when the will of the majority is brought to\r\nbear directly upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is time that this great question should be settled. Congress goes on\r\nmaking appropriations for a road here, a canal there, a harbour or a\r\nlight-house somewhere else. All these may or may not be necessary.\r\nMeantime, those who have law on their side, exclaim against\r\nextravagance, jobbing, and encroachment on popular rights. Those who\r\nhave expediency on their side plead necessity, the popular will, and the\r\nincreasing surplus revenue.\r\n\r\nIf the constitution provides means by which law, expediency, and the\r\nprevention of abuse, can be reconciled to the satisfaction of all,\r\nsurely the sooner it is done the better. Thus the matter appears to a\r\npassing stranger.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"The income of the public works of the State\" (South Carolina) \"is\r\nvery small, not exceeding 15,000 dollars per annum, over the cost of\r\nmanagement, although the State has incurred a debt of 2,000,000 in\r\nconstructing them. In many parts of the State, canals have been\r\nconstructed, which do not yield sufficient to pay their current\r\nexpenses; and, with the exception of the State road, and the Columbia\r\ncanal, there is hardly a public work in the State, which, put up at\r\npublic auction, would find a purchaser.\"\r\n\r\n1833. _American Annual Register_, p. 285.\r\n\r\n[2] President Jackson is of opinion that no toll should be levied on\r\nways provided by the public revenue. It should be a complete and final\r\noutlay, and none of the people compelled to pay for works effected by\r\nthe people's money. This seems clearly right.\r\n\r\n[3] South Carolina was in favour of Internal Improvements, till it was\r\nfound how much larger a share of the benefit would be appropriated by\r\nthe active and prosperous northern States than by those which are\r\ndepressed by slavery. Since that discovery, South Carolina's sectional\r\njealousy has been unbounded, and her opposition to the exercise of the\r\npower very fierce. In her periodical publications, as well as through\r\nother channels, she has declared herself neglected, or likely to be\r\nneglected, on account of her being southern. The enterprise of the North\r\nand depression of the South are, as usual, looked upon as favour and\r\nneglect, shown by the general government.\r\n\r\n[4] When I was ascending the Mississippi, I observed a light-house\r\nperched on a bluff, in a ridiculous situation. On asking the meaning of\r\nthe phenomenon, I was told that a senator from the State of Mississippi,\r\nwishing to make a flourish about his zeal for the improvement of his\r\nState, had obtained an appropriation from Congress to build this\r\nlight-house, which is of no earthly use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n     \"The crude treasures, perpetually exposed before our eyes, contain\r\n     within them other and more valuable principles. All these,\r\n     likewise, in their numberless combinations, which ages of labour\r\n     and research can never exhaust, may be destined to furnish, in\r\n     perpetual succession, new sources of our wealth and of our\r\n     happiness.\"\r\n\r\n     BABBAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole American people suffered, during the revolutionary war, from\r\nthe want of the comforts and some of the necessaries of life, now so\r\ncalled. Their commerce with the world abroad being almost wholly\r\nintercepted, they had nothing wherewith to console themselves but the\r\nstocks which might be left in their warehouses, and the produce of their\r\nsoil. It is amazing, at this day, to hear of the wants of the commonest\r\narticles of clothing and domestic use, undergone in those days by some\r\nof the first families in the republic.\r\n\r\nThe experience of these troubles suggested to many persons the\r\nexpediency of establishing manufactures in the United States: but there\r\nwas an almost universal prejudice against this mode of employment. It is\r\namusing now to read Hamilton's celebrated Report on Manufactures,\r\npresented in 1790, and to see how elaborately the popular objections to\r\nmanufactures are answered. The persuasion of the nation was that America\r\nwas designed to be an agricultural country; that agriculture was wholly\r\nproductive, and manufactures not productive at all; and that agriculture\r\nwas the more honourable occupation. The two former prejudices have been\r\nput to flight by happy experience. The last still lingers. It is not\r\nfive years since the President's message declared that \"the wealth and\r\nstrength of a country are its population; and the best part of that\r\npopulation are the cultivators of the soil.\"\r\n\r\nSuch prepossessions may be left to die out. They arise mainly from a\r\nvery good notion, not very clearly defined;--that the more intercourse\r\nmen have with Nature, the better for the men. This is true; but Nature\r\nis present in all places where the hands of men work, if the workmen can\r\nbut see her. If Nature is supposed present only where there is a blue\r\nsky overhead, and grass and trees around, this shows only the narrowness\r\nof mind of him who thus supposes. Her forces are at work wherever there\r\nis mechanism; and man only directs them to his particular purpose. In\r\nAmerica, it may be said that her beauty is present wherever her forces\r\nare at work; for men have there set up their mechanism in some of the\r\nchoicest spots in the land. There is a good and an evil aspect belonging\r\nto all things. If tourists are exasperated at fine scenery being\r\ndeformed by the erection of mills, (which in many instances are more of\r\nan ornament than a deformity,) let others be awake to the advantage that\r\nit is to the work-people to have their dwellings and their occupation\r\nfixed in spots where the hills are heaped together, and the waters leap\r\nand whirl among rocks, rather than in dull suburbs where they and their\r\nemployments may not annoy the eye of the lover of the picturesque. It\r\nalways gave me pleasure to see the artisans at work about such places as\r\nGlen's Falls, the Falls of the Genessee, and on the banks of some of the\r\nwhirling streams in the New England valleys. I felt that they caught, or\r\nmight catch, as beautiful glimpses of Nature's face as the western\r\nsettler. If the internal circumstances were favourable, there was little\r\nin the outward to choose between. If they had the open mind's eye to see\r\nbeauty, and the soul to feel wonder, it mattered little whether it was\r\nthe forest or the waterfall (even though it were called the\r\n\"water-privilege\") that they had to look upon; whether it was by the\r\nagency of vegetation or of steam that they had to work. It is deplorable\r\nenough, in this view, to be a poor artisan in the heart of our English\r\nManchester: but to be a thriving one in the most beautiful outskirts of\r\nSheffield is, perhaps, as favourable a lot for the lover of nature as to\r\nbe a labourer on any soil: and the privileges of the American artisans\r\nare like this.\r\n\r\nAs to the old objection to American manufactures, that America was\r\ndesigned to be an agricultural country,--it seems to me, as I said\r\nbefore, that America was meant to be everything. Her group of republics\r\nis merged in one, in the eyes of the world; and, for some purposes, in\r\nreality: but this involves no obligation to make them all alike in their\r\nproduce and occupations; but rather the contrary. Here, as everywhere\r\nelse, let the laws of nature be followed, and the procedure will be\r\nwise. Nature has nothing to do with artificial boundaries and arbitrary\r\ninclosures. There are many soils and many climates included within the\r\nboundary line of the United States; many _countries_; and one rule\r\ncannot be laid down for all. If there be any one or more of these where\r\nthe requisites for manufactures are present, and those for agriculture\r\ndeficient, there let manufactures arise. If there is poor land, and good\r\nmill-seats; abundant material, animal and mineral, on the spot, and\r\nvegetable easily to be procured; a sufficiency of hands, and talent for\r\nthe construction and use of machinery, there should manufactures spring\r\nup. This is eminently the case with New England, and some other parts of\r\nthe United States. It was perceived to be so, even in the days when the\r\ngrowth of cotton in the south was spoken of as a small experiment, not\r\nlikely to produce great consequences.\r\n\r\nNew England formerly depended chiefly on the carrying trade. When that\r\nresource was diminished, after the war, it is difficult to see how her\r\npeople were to be prevented setting up manufactures, or why they needed\r\nany particular exhortation or assistance to do it. They had the\r\nopportunity of obtaining foreign capital; their previous foreign\r\nintercourses having pointed out to them where it had accumulated, and\r\nmight therefore be obtained with advantage. They had a vast material,\r\nleft from their fisheries, of skins, oil, and the bones of marine\r\nanimals; they had bark, hides, wood, flax, hemp, iron, and clay. They\r\nhad also the requisite skill; as may be seen by the following list of\r\ndomestic manufactures, carried on in private houses only, in 1790.\r\n\"Great quantities of coarse cloths, coatings, serges and flannels,\r\nlinsey-woolseys, hosiery of wool, cotton, and thread, coarse fustians,\r\njeans, and muslins, coverlets and counterpanes, tow linens, coarse\r\nshirtings, sheetings, towellings, and table-linen, and various mixtures\r\nof wool and cotton, and of cotton and flax, are made in the household\r\nway; and, in many instances, to an extent not only sufficient for the\r\nsupply of the family in which they are made, but for sale, and even in\r\nsome cases for exportation. It is computed, in a number of districts,\r\nthat two-thirds, three-fourths, and even four-fifths of all the clothing\r\nof the inhabitants, are made by themselves.\"[5] If all this was done\r\nwithout the advantage of division of labour, of masses of capital, or of\r\nother machinery than might be set up in a farm-house parlour, it is\r\nclear that this region was fully prepared, five-and-forty years ago, for\r\nthe introduction of manufactures on a large scale; and there appears\r\nevery reason to believe that they might have been left to their natural\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe same Report mentions seventeen classes of manufacture going on as\r\ndistinct trades, at the same time, in the northern States.\r\n\r\nThe only plausible objection to the establishment of manufactures was\r\nthe scarcity and dearness of labour, in comparison with that of the old\r\ncountries of Europe. But, if the exportation of some articles actually\r\ntook place, while the labour which produced them was scattered about in\r\nfarm-houses, what might not be expected if the same labour could be\r\ncalled forth and concentrated, and aided by the introduction of\r\nmachinery? A great immigration of artisans might also be looked for,\r\nwhen once any temptation was held out to the poor of Europe to come over\r\nto a young and thriving country. Moreover, improvements in machinery are\r\nthe invariable consequence of a deficiency of manufacturing labour; for\r\nthe obvious reason that men's wits are urged to supply the want under\r\nwhich their interests suffer. Again: manufactures can, to a considerable\r\ndegree, be carried on by the labour of women; and there is a great\r\nnumber of unemployed women in New England, from the circumstance that\r\nthe young men of that region wander away in search of a settlement on\r\nthe land; and, after being settled, find wives in the south and west.\r\n\r\nThus much of the case might have been, and was by some, foreseen. What\r\nhas been the event?\r\n\r\nIn 1825, the amount of manufactures exported from the United States, was\r\n5,729,797 dollars. Of these about one-fourth were cotton-piece goods, in\r\nthe sale of which the American merchants were now able to compete with\r\nthe English, in some foreign markets. The manufacture of cottons in the\r\nUnited States afforded a market for one hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand bales of cotton annually; and the printed cottons manufactured\r\nat home amounted annually to fourteen millions of yards. The importation\r\nof cotton goods into the country in 1825 was in value between twelve and\r\nthirteen millions of dollars; and in 1826, between nine and ten\r\nmillions. The woollen manufacture has never flourished like the cotton;\r\nthe bad effects of the tariff being more immediately visible in regard\r\nto articles of manufacture whose raw material must be chiefly derived\r\nfrom abroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, the legislature of Massachusetts passed resolutions deploring\r\nthe increasing depression of the woollen manufacture, and praying for\r\nincreased protection from Congress. The exportation of cotton goods that\r\nyear amounted to upwards of a million of dollars; and the next year to\r\nnearly a million and a half. The importation of cotton goods was all but\r\nprohibited by the tariff of 1824: and the consequence was an immense\r\ninvestment of capital in the cotton manufacture, almost on the instant;\r\nand some perilous fluctuations since, too nearly resembling the\r\nagitations of older countries, where the pernicious policy of ages has\r\naccumulated difficulties on the present generation.\r\n\r\nAt Lowell, in Massachusetts, there was in 1818, a small satinet mill,\r\nemploying about twenty hands; the place itself containing two hundred\r\ninhabitants. In 1825, the Merrimack Manufacturing Company was formed;\r\nit was joined by others; and in 1832, the capital invested was above six\r\nmillions of dollars. The whole number of operatives employed was five\r\nthousand; of whom three thousand eight hundred were women and girls. The\r\nquantity of raw cotton used was upwards of twenty thousand bales. The\r\nquantity of pure cotton goods manufactured was twenty-five millions of\r\nyards. The woollen fabric manufactured in these establishments was, at\r\nthe same time, one hundred and fifty thousand yards. Sixty-eight\r\ncarpet-looms were at work also. The workmen employed in all these\r\noperations received for wages about 1,200,000 dollars per annum. About\r\ntwo hundred mechanics, of a high order of ability, are constantly\r\nemployed. The fuel consumed in a year is five thousand tons of\r\nanthracite coal, besides charcoal and wood.\r\n\r\nThe same protective system which caused the sudden growth of such an\r\nestablishment as this, tempted numerous capitalists to seek their share\r\nof the supposed benefits of the tariff. The manufacturing interest was\r\nwell nigh ruined by the protection it had asked for. The competition and\r\nconsequent over-manufacture were tremendous. Failure after failure took\r\nplace, till forty-five thousand spindles were standing idle, and\r\nthousands of operatives were thrown into a state of poverty unnatural\r\nenough in such a country as theirs. A cry was raised by many for a\r\nrepeal of the tariff: this created a panic among those who, on the\r\nstrength of the tariff, had withdrawn their capital from commerce, and\r\ninvested it in manufactures. The stock of all the manufacturing\r\ncompanies was offered in vain, at prices ruinously low. Thus stood\r\nmatters in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe history of the quarrel between the north and south about the tariff,\r\nand the nature of the Compromise Bill, is already known. The mischief\r\ndone will be repaired, as far as reparation is possible, by the\r\nreduction of the import duties, year by year, till 1842. If the demands\r\nof the country and of foreign customers should not rise to the limit of\r\nthe over-manufacture which has taken place, time is thus allowed for the\r\ngradual withdrawing of the capital and industry which have been seduced\r\ninto this method of employment. Meantime, the manufactures of the\r\nnorthern States are permanently established, though not in the wisest\r\nway. If they had been left to themselves, they would have been an\r\nunmixed good to the community. As it is, society has suffered the\r\ninevitable consequences of an irrational policy,--a policy indefensible\r\nin a republic. It is well that the experiment wrought out its\r\nconsequences so speedily and so plainly that any repetition is\r\nunlikely,--little as the natural laws which regulate commerce are yet\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, the total number of looms employed in the cotton manufacture of\r\nthe United States was 33,433. Of these, 21,336 were in New England;\r\n3,653 in New York State; 6,301 in Pennsylvania; and the rest in\r\nMaryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia.\r\n\r\nNext to the cotton and woollen manufactures, the most valuable are\r\nmanufactures from flax and hemp; from tobacco and grain; sugar, soap,\r\nand candles, gunpowder, gold and silver coin, iron, copper and brass,\r\nhats, medicinal drugs, and shoes.\r\n\r\nThe shoe manufacture is one of the most remarkable in the States, from\r\nthe suddenness and extent of its spread. It has been mentioned that the\r\nshoe trade of New York State is more valuable than the total commerce of\r\nGeorgia. The extent to which the manufacture is carried on in one\r\nvillage in Massachusetts, with which I am acquainted, shows the\r\nprosperity of the business.\r\n\r\nIn order to shoemaking, there must be tanning. There are many and large\r\ntanneries in Danvers and the outskirts of Salem, for the supply of the\r\nLynn shoe-manufacture. The largest tannery in the United States is at\r\nSalem. The hides are partly imported. The bark is brought from Maine.\r\nThese tanneries were in a state of temporary adversity when I saw them.\r\nSome kinds of skins are two or three years in tanning; and capital is\r\nthus locked up in such amounts as render fluctuation dangerous. It had\r\nlately been discovered that oak bark could be had cheaper, and tanning\r\nconsequently carried on to a greater advantage up the Hudson than on the\r\nMassachusetts coast: so that the tanners and curriers of Salem and\r\nDanvers were descending somewhat from their high prosperity. But nothing\r\ncould exceed the nourishing aspect of Lynn, the sanctum of St. Crispin.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, the value of boots and shoes, (very few boots, and chiefly\r\nladies' shoes,) made at Lynn was nearly a million of dollars a year. The\r\ntotal number made was above a million and a half pairs: the number of\r\npeople employed, three thousand five hundred; being about seven-eighths\r\nof the population of the place, partially employed; and some hundreds\r\nfrom other places, wholly employed. Last year, the place was much on the\r\nincrease. A green, with a piece of water in the middle, and trees, was\r\nbeing laid out in the centre of the town. New houses were rising in all\r\ndirections, and fresh hands were welcomed from any quarter; for the\r\norders sent could not be executed. Besides the domestic supply, two\r\nmillion pairs of ladies' shoes a-year were sent off to the remotest\r\ncorners of the States; and, as they have once penetrated there, it seems\r\ndifficult to imagine where the demand will stop; for those remote\r\ncorners are all being more thickly peopled every day. Their united\r\ndemand will be enough to make the fortune of a whole State.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that a few more manufactures may be added to those\r\nwhich are sure to flourish in the United States: as silk and wine. If\r\nthe government firmly refuses to interfere again in the way of\r\nprotection, it will be easily and safely discoverable what resources the\r\ncountry really possesses; and what direction her improving industry may\r\nnaturally and profitably take.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF.\r\n\r\nIf I were to go into anything like a detailed account of what I heard\r\nabout the tariff, during my travels, no room would be left for more\r\ninteresting affairs. The recrimination on the subject is endless. With\r\nall this we have nothing to do, now that it is over. The philosophy and\r\nfact of the transaction, and not the changes of opinion and\r\ninconsistency of conduct of public men, are now of importance. It would\r\nbe well now to leave the persons, and look at the thing.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only fact in relation to the tariff that I never heard\r\ndisputed is that it was, under one aspect, a measure of retaliation.\r\nRendering evil for evil answers no better in economical than in moral\r\naffairs; even if it take the name of self-defence. Because the British\r\nare foolish and wrong in refusing to admit American corn, the Americans\r\nexcluded British cottons and woollens. More was said, and I believe\r\nsincerely, about self-defence than about retaliation: but it is very\r\nremarkable that men so clear-headed, inquiring, and sagacious as the\r\nauthors of the American system, should not have seen further into the\r\ncondition of their own country, and learned more from the unhappy\r\nexperience of Europe, than to imagine that they could neutralise the\r\neffects of the bad policy of England by adopting the same bad policy\r\nthemselves. It is strange that they did not see that if British cottons\r\nand woollens found easy entrance into their country, it must have been\r\nin exchange for something, though that something was not corn. It was\r\nstrange that they did not see that if the apparent facilities for\r\nmanufactures in the northern States were really great enough to justify\r\nmanufactures, individual enterprise would be sure to find it out; and\r\nall the more readily for the deficiency in the resources of New England,\r\nwhich is assigned as the reason for offering her legislative protection.\r\nThere was not even the excuse for interference which exists in old\r\ncountries; that by intricate complexities of mismanagement, economical\r\naffairs have been perverted from their natural course. Here, in America,\r\na new branch of industry was to be instituted. The skill was ready; the\r\nmaterial was ready; the capital was procurable, if the object was good;\r\nand ought not to be, if the object was unsound. The interests of the\r\npeople might have been trusted in their own hands. They would of\r\nthemselves have taken less of British cotton goods, and more of\r\nsomething else which they could not get at home, if cotton goods could\r\nbe made better and cheaper at home than in England; which it is proved\r\nthat, for the most part, they can be. It is anticipated that when the\r\nCompromise method expires, the home manufacture of some kinds of fine\r\ncotton goods will diminish; but that the bulk of the manufacture is\r\nbeyond the reach of accident. The effect of the tariff has been to\r\nover-stimulate a natural process, and thus to cause over-manufacture,\r\npanic, and ruin to many. It is said, and with truth, that America can\r\nafford to try experiments; that America is the very country that should\r\nlearn by experience; and so forth. But it should be remembered that\r\nthose who suffer are not always those who should be the learners. In New\r\nEngland, there is a large class of very poor women,--ladies; some\r\nworking; some unable to work. I knew many of these; and was struck with\r\nthe great number of them who assigned as the cause of their poverty the\r\ndepreciation of factory stock, or the failure in other ways of factory\r\nschemes, in which their parents or other friends had, beguiled by the\r\npromises of the tariff, invested what should have been their\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nNo more need be said on the policy of the tariff. The truth is now very\r\nextensively acknowledged; and though some of those who are answerable\r\nfor the American system continue to assume that manufactures could not\r\nhave been instituted without its assistance, I believe it is pretty\r\ngenerally understood that no more infant manufactures will be burdened\r\nwith this cruel kind of protection.\r\n\r\nA far more important question than that of the policy is that of the\r\nprinciple of a protective system in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the strongest resistance was made to the American\r\nsystem on the ground of its being unconstitutional. Its advocates\r\nrelied, for the necessary sanction, on the clauses which provide that\r\n\"Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, and duties,\r\nimposts, and excises;\"----and \"to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations.\" With regard to the first of these clauses, both parties seem,\r\nmore or less, in the right. By the tariff, Congress proposed \"to lay and\r\ncollect duties and imposts,\" as the constitution gives it express leave\r\nto do. Yet it is clear to those who view the constitution in the light\r\nof the sun of the revolution, that, such permission was given solely\r\nwith a view to the collection of the revenue. No one of the framers of\r\nthe constitution could have foreseen that any proposal would be made to\r\nlay duties for the protection of the productive interests of a section\r\nof the Union. Such a use of the clause is forbidden in spirit, though\r\nnot in the letter, by the clause which ordains, \"but all duties,\r\nimposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\"\r\nThis clause is, in its spirit, wholly condemnatory of partial\r\nlegislation by Congress.\r\n\r\nRemarks somewhat analogous may be made respecting the other clause,\r\nwhich empowers Congress \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\" By\r\nthe letter of this clause, Congress may appear to a superficial observer\r\nauthorised so to regulate its commerce with Great Britain as to cause an\r\narbitrary distribution of property and industry within her own\r\nboundaries; but such a double action could never have been in\r\ncontemplation of the framers of the instrument. What they had in view\r\nwas obviously the guardianship of the national commercial rights, and\r\nthe promotion of the national commercial, not sectional manufacturing,\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nWhere the letter and the spirit of the constitution are made, by lapse\r\nof time and change of circumstance, to bear out opposite modes of\r\nconduct, there is an appeal which every man must make, for his\r\nindividual satisfaction and conviction. He must appeal to the\r\nfundamental republican principles, out of which grew both the spirit and\r\nthe letter of the constitution.\r\n\r\nBy these the tariff is hopelessly condemned. It is contrary to all sound\r\nrepublican principle that the general government of a nation, widely\r\nspread over regions, and separated into sections diversified in their\r\nproductions, occupations, and interests, should use its power of\r\nlegislating for the whole to provide for the particular interests of a\r\npart. The principle of perfect political and social equality is violated\r\nwhen the general government takes cognisance of local objects so far as\r\nto do a deed which must materially affect the distribution of private\r\nproperty; so far as to lay a tax on the whole of the nation for the\r\navowed object of benefiting a part. The government of a republic has no\r\nbusiness with distinctions among its subjects. It is to have no respect\r\nof classes, more than of individuals. Its functions are to be discharged\r\nfor the common interest; and it is to entertain no fancies as to what\r\nnew institutions or arrangements will be beneficial or the contrary to\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nAll such institutions and arrangements must be made within the several\r\nStates, or by an agreement of States; subject, of course, to the\r\npermissions and prohibitions of the constitution. If one State, or\r\nseveral States, should be pleased to decree bounties on their own\r\nmanufactures, let them do so. Whether the measure were wise or unwise,\r\nno one out of the limits of such State or States would have a right to\r\ncomplain. This could not be said under the tariff. It was a just\r\ncomplaint which was urged by many States, that the federal\r\nrepresentation was made useless to the minority, from the moment that\r\nthe federal government applied itself to favour local and particular\r\ninterests. The case is not altered by the possible result being highly\r\nbeneficial to the whole country; which is the plea industriously\r\nadvanced by the advocates of the tariff. Whatever direction and\r\napplication of industry and capital may be ultimately most beneficial,\r\nCongress has, on principle, no more business with it than with the\r\nsupport of what may prove in the end to be the purest religious\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nIf America had been as free, from the beginning, in all respects, as a\r\nyoung country ought to be,--free to run her natural course of\r\nprosperity, subject only to the faithful laws which regulate the economy\r\nof society as beneficially as another set of laws regulates the seasons,\r\nwe might never have heard of the American system. The poisonous anomaly\r\nwhich has caused almost all the diseases that have afflicted the\r\nrepublic, appears to be the original infection here also. If labour in\r\nthe southern States had been free long ago, the deterioration of\r\nsouthern property would not have caused the southern planters to clamour\r\nfor legislative protection. The arbitrary tenure of labour made them\r\ndesire an arbitrary distribution of capital. They desired it for the\r\nnorth, as eagerly as for themselves, expecting the result to be that the\r\ncotton-growers would be protected by heavy import duties on cotton; and\r\nthat the prosperity of the north, depending, as they supposed, wholly on\r\nits commerce, would be crippled by the same means; and thus, something\r\nlike an equality between north and south be restored. The effect was\r\ndifferent from what had been anticipated. The deterioration of the south\r\nwent on; and manufactures first replaced, and then renovated, the\r\ncommerce of the north. The next consequence was natural enough. The\r\nsouth became infuriated against the tariff, not only on the reasonable\r\nground of its badness of principle, but on the allegation that it was\r\nthe cause of all the woes of the south,[6] and all the prosperity,\r\ndiversified with woes, of the north. It has always been the method of\r\nslaveholders to lay the blame of their sufferings upon everything but\r\nthe real cause. Any one who reads the history of slavery in the book of\r\nevents, will find slave-holders of every country complaining bitterly\r\nand incessantly of the want of legislative protection to themselves, or\r\nof its being granted to others. In the present instance, it was a device\r\nof the slave-holders, to renovate their falling fortunes, turned against\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe true dignity of America would have been, had circumstances allowed\r\nof it, to have followed out her own republican principles, instead of\r\nadopting the false principles and injurious policy of older and less\r\nfavoured nations. If she had left labour and commerce, and capital\r\nfree; disdaining interference at home and retaliation abroad; showing\r\nher faith in the natural laws of social economy by calmly committing to\r\nthem the external interests of her people, she would by this time have\r\nbeen the pattern and instructress of the civilised world, in the\r\nphilosophy of production and commerce. But she had not the knowledge nor\r\nthe requisite faith; nor was it to be reasonably expected that she\r\nshould. Her doctrine was, and I fear still is, that she need not study\r\npolitical economy while she is so prosperous as at present: that\r\npolitical economy is for those who are under adversity. If in other\r\ncases she allows that prevention is better than cure, avoidance than\r\nreparation, why not in this? It may not yet be too late for her to be in\r\nthe van of all the world in economical as in political philosophy. The\r\nold world will still be long in getting above its bad institutions. If\r\nAmerica would free her servile class by the time the provisions of the\r\nCompromise Bill expire, and start afresh in pure economical freedom, she\r\nmight yet be the first to show, by her transcendent peace and\r\nprosperity, that democratic principles are the true foundation of\r\neconomical, as well as political, welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING LABOUR.\r\n\r\nSo much is said in Europe of the scarcity of agricultural labour in the\r\nUnited States, that it is a matter of surprise that manufactures should\r\nhave succeeded as they have done. It is even supposed by some that the\r\ntariff was rendered necessary by a deficiency of labour: that by\r\noffering a premium on manufacturing industry, the requisite amount was\r\nsought to be drawn away from other employments, and concentrated upon\r\nthis. This is a mistake. There is every reason to suppose that the\r\nrequisite amount of labour would have been forthcoming, if affairs had\r\nbeen left to take their natural course.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that domestic manufactures were carried on to a great\r\nextent, so far back as 1790. From that time to this, they have never\r\naltogether ceased in the farm-houses, as the homespun, still so\r\nfrequently to be seen all over the country, and the agricultural\r\nmeetings of New England, (where there is usually a display of domestic\r\nmanufactures,) will testify. The hands by which these products are\r\nwrought come to the factories, when the demand for labour renders it\r\nworth while; and drop back into the farm-houses when the demand\r\nslackens.\r\n\r\nIt is not the custom in America for women (except slaves) to work out of\r\ndoors. It has been mentioned that the young men of New England migrate\r\nin large numbers to the west, leaving an over-proportion of female\r\npopulation, the amount of which I could never learn. Statements were\r\nmade to me; but so incredible that I withhold them. Suffice it that\r\nthere are many more women than men in from six to nine States of the\r\nUnion. There is reason to believe that there was much silent suffering\r\nfrom poverty before the institution of factories; that they afford a\r\nmost welcome resource to some thousands of young women, unwilling to\r\ngive themselves to domestic service, and precluded, by the customs of\r\nthe country, from rural labour. We have seen how large a proportion of\r\nthe labour in the Lowell factories is supplied by women.\r\n\r\nMuch of the rest is furnished by immigrants. I saw English, Irish, and\r\nScotch operatives. I heard but a poor character of the English\r\noperatives; and the Scotch were pronounced \"ten times better.\" The\r\nEnglish are jealous of their 'bargain,' and on the watch lest they\r\nshould be asked to do more than they stipulated for: their habits are\r\nnot so sober as those of the Scotch, and they are incapable of going\r\nbeyond the single operation they profess. Such is the testimony of their\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nThe demand for labour is, however, sufficiently imperious in all the\r\nmechanical departments to make it surprising that prison labour is\r\nregarded with such jealousy as I have witnessed. When it is considered\r\nhow small a class the convicts of the United States are, and are likely\r\nto remain, how essential labour is to their reformation, how few are the\r\nkinds of manufacture which they can practise, and that it is of some\r\nimportance that prison establishments should maintain themselves, it\r\nseems wholly unworthy of the intelligent mechanics of America that they\r\nshould be so afraid of convict labour as actually to obtain pledges from\r\nsome candidates for office, to propose the abolition of prison\r\nmanufactures. I believe that the Sing-Sing and Auburn prisons, in the\r\nState of New York, turn out a greater variety and amount of products\r\nthan any others; and they have yet done very little more than maintain\r\nthemselves. The Sing-Sing convicts quarry and dress granite: the Auburn\r\nprisoners make clocks, combs, shoes, carpets, and machinery. They are\r\ncabinet and chair-makers, weavers, and tailors. There were 650 prisoners\r\nwhen I was there; and of these many were inexperienced workmen; and all\r\nwere not employed in manufactures. Jealousy of such a set of craftsmen\r\nis absurd, in the present state of the American labour-market.\r\n\r\nI saw specimens of each of these kinds of labour. A few days after I\r\nentered the country, I was taken to an agricultural meeting, held\r\nannually at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. We were too late to see the best\r\npart of it,--the dispensing of prizes for the best agricultural skill,\r\nand for the choicest domestic manufactures. But there were specimens\r\nleft which surprised me by the excellence of their quality;--table and\r\nbed-linen, diapers, blankets, and knitted wares. There was an ingenious\r\nmodel of a bed for invalids, combining many sorts of facilities for\r\nchange of posture. There were nearly as many women as men at this\r\nmeeting; all were well dressed, and going to and fro in the household\r\nvehicle, the country-wagon, with the invariable bear-skin covering the\r\nseat, and peeping out on all sides. A comfortable display, from the\r\nremains of the dinner, was set out for us by smart mulatto girls, with\r\nsnow-berries in their hair. The mechanics' houses in this beautiful\r\nvillage would be enough, if they could be exhibited in England, to tempt\r\nover half her operatives to the new world.\r\n\r\nThe first cotton-mill that I saw was at Paterson, New Jersey. It was set\r\nup at first with nine hundred spindles, which were afterwards increased\r\nto fifteen hundred; then to six thousand. Building was still going on\r\nwhen I was there. The girls were all well-dressed. Their hair was\r\narranged according to the latest fashions which had arrived, viâ New\r\nYork, and they wore calashes in going to and fro between their dwellings\r\nand the mill. I saw some of the children barefooted, but carrying\r\numbrellas, under a slight sprinkling of rain. I asked whether those who\r\ncould afford umbrellas went barefoot for coolness, or other convenience.\r\nThe proprietor told me that there had probably been an economical\r\ncalculation in the case. Stockings and shoes would defend only the feet;\r\nwhile the umbrella would preserve the gloss of the whole of the rest of\r\nthe costume. There seems, however, to be a strong predilection for\r\numbrellas in the United States. A convict, in solitary confinement in\r\nthe Philadelphia prison, gave me the history of all his burglaries. The\r\nproximate cause of his capture after the last was an umbrella. He had\r\nbroken into a good-looking house, and traversed it in vain in search of\r\nsomething worth the risk of carrying away. On leaving the house, he\r\nfound it rained. He went back, and took a new cotton umbrella. It dawned\r\nas he entered the city, and he was afraid of being seen with the\r\numbrella; but thought suspicion would be excited if he \"heaved it away.\"\r\nHe met an acquaintance who was further from home than himself, and\r\ninsisted on his accepting the loan of the umbrella. The acquaintance, of\r\ncourse, was caught, and told from whom he had had the umbrella; and the\r\nburglar was, in consequence, lodged in jail. What English burglar would\r\nhave thought of minding rain? If, however, there ever was a case of\r\namateur burglary, this was one.\r\n\r\nI visited the corporate factory-establishment at Waltham, within a few\r\nmiles of Boston. The Waltham Mills were at work before those of Lowell\r\nwere set up. The establishment is for the spinning and weaving of cotton\r\nalone, and the construction of the requisite machinery. Five hundred\r\npersons were employed at the time of my visit. The girls earn two, and\r\nsome three, dollars a-week, besides their board. The little children\r\nearn one dollar a-week. Most of the girls live in the houses provided by\r\nthe corporation, which accommodate from six to eight each. When sisters\r\ncome to the mill, it is a common practice for them to bring their mother\r\nto keep house for them and some of their companions, in a dwelling built\r\nby their own earnings. In this case, they save enough out of their board\r\nto clothe themselves, and have their two or three dollars a-week to\r\nspare. Some have thus cleared off mortgages from their fathers' farms;\r\nothers have educated the hope of the family at college; and many are\r\nrapidly accumulating an independence. I saw a whole street of houses\r\nbuilt with the earnings of the girls; some with piazzas, and green\r\nvenetian blinds and all neat and sufficiently spacious.\r\n\r\nThe factory people built the church, which stands conspicuous on the\r\ngreen in the midst of the place. The minister's salary (eight hundred\r\ndollars last year) is raised by a tax on the pews. The corporation gave\r\nthem a building for a lyceum, which they have furnished with a good\r\nlibrary, and where they have lectures every winter,--the best that money\r\ncan procure. The girls have, in many instances, private libraries of\r\nsome merit and value.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the various factory establishments keep the wages as\r\nnearly equal as possible, and then let the girls freely shift about from\r\none to another. When a girl comes to the overseer to inform him of her\r\nintention of working at the mill, he welcomes her, and asks how long she\r\nmeans to stay. It may be six months, or a year, or five years, or for\r\nlife. She declares what she considers herself fit for, and sets to work\r\naccordingly. If she finds that she cannot work so as to keep up with the\r\ncompanion appointed to her, or to please her employer or herself, she\r\ncomes to the overseer, and volunteers to pick cotton, or sweep the\r\nrooms, or undertake some other service that she can perform.\r\n\r\nThe people work about seventy hours per week, on the average. The time\r\nof work varies with the length of the days, the wages continuing the\r\nsame. All look like well-dressed young ladies. The health is good; or\r\nrather, (as this is too much to be said about health any where in the\r\nUnited States,) it is no worse than it is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThese facts speak for themselves. There is no need to enlarge on the\r\npleasure of an acquaintance with the operative classes of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe shoe-making at Lynn is carried on almost entirely in private\r\ndwellings, from the circumstance that the people who do it are almost\r\nall farmers or fishermen likewise. A stranger who has not been\r\nenlightened upon the ways of the place would be astonished at the number\r\nof small square erections, like miniature school-houses, standing each\r\nas an appendage to a dwelling-house. These are the \"shoe shops,\" where\r\nthe father of the family and his boys work, while the women within are\r\nemployed in binding and trimming. Thirty or more of these shoe-shops may\r\nbe counted in a walk of half-a-mile. When a Lynn shoe manufacturer\r\nreceives an order, he issues the tidings. The leather is cut out by men\r\non his premises; and then the work is given to those who apply for it;\r\nif possible, in small quantities, for the sake of dispatch. The shoes\r\nare brought home on Friday night, packed off on Saturday, and in a\r\nfortnight or three weeks are on the feet of dwellers in all parts of the\r\nUnion. The whole family works upon shoes during the winter; and in the\r\nsummer, the father and sons turn out into the fields, or go fishing. I\r\nknew of an instance where a little boy and girl maintained the whole\r\nfamily, while the earnings of the rest went to build a house. I saw very\r\nfew shabby houses. Quakers are numerous in Lynn. The place is\r\nunboundedly prosperous, through the temperance and industry of the\r\npeople. The deposits in the Lynn Savings' Bank in 1834, were about\r\n34,000 dollars, the population of the town being then 4,000. Since that\r\ntime, both the population and the prosperity have much increased. It\r\nmust be remembered, too, that the mechanics of America have more uses\r\nfor their money than are open to the operatives of England. They build\r\nhouses, buy land, and educate their sons and daughters.[7]\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that the pleasures and pains of life are pretty\r\nequally distributed among its various vocations and positions: but it is\r\ndifficult to keep clear of the impression which outward circumstances\r\noccasion, that some are eminently desirable. The mechanics of these\r\nnorthern States appear to me the most favoured class I have ever known.\r\nIn England, I believe the highest order of mechanics to be, as a class,\r\nthe wisest and best men of the community. They have the fewest base and\r\nnarrow interests: they are brought into sufficient contact with the\r\nrealities of existence, without being hardened by excess of toil and\r\ncare; and the knowledge they have the opportunity of gaining is of the\r\nbest kind for the health of the mind. To them, if to any, we may look\r\nfor public and private virtue. The mechanics of America have nearly all\r\nthe same advantages, and some others. They have better means of living:\r\ntheir labours are perhaps more honoured; and they are republicans,\r\nenjoying the powers and prospects of perfectly equal citizenship. The\r\nonly respect in which their condition falls below that of English\r\nartisans of the highest order is that the knowledge which they have\r\ncommonly the means of obtaining is not of equal value. The facilities\r\nare great: schools, lyceums, libraries, are open to them: but the\r\ninstruction imparted there is not so good as they deserve. Whenever they\r\nhave this, it will be difficult to imagine a mode of life more\r\nfavourable to virtue and happiness than theirs.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt among those who know both England and\r\nAmerica, that the mechanics of the New World work harder than those of\r\nthe Old. They have much to do besides their daily handicraft business.\r\nThey are up and at work early about this; and when it is done, they read\r\ntill late, or attend lectures; or perhaps have their houses to build or\r\nrepair, or other care to take of their property. They live in a state\r\nand period of society where every man is answerable for his own\r\nfortunes; and where there is therefore stimulus to the exercise of every\r\npower.\r\n\r\nWhat a state of society it is when a dozen artisans of one\r\ntown,--Salem,--are seen rearing each a comfortable one-story (or, as the\r\nAmericans would say, two-story) house, in the place with which they have\r\ngrown up! when a man who began with laying bricks criticises, and\r\nsometimes corrects, his lawyer's composition; when a poor errand-boy\r\nbecomes the proprietor of a flourishing store, before he is thirty; pays\r\noff the capital advanced by his friends at the rate of 2,000 dollars per\r\nmonth; and bids fair to be one of the most substantial citizens of the\r\nplace!\r\n\r\nSuch are the outward fortunes of the mechanics of America. Of their\r\nwelfare in more important respects, to which these are but a part of the\r\nmeans, I shall have to speak in another connexion.\r\n\r\nThere are troubles between employers and their workmen in the United\r\nStates, as elsewhere: but the case of the men is so much more in their\r\nown hands there than where labour superabounds, that strikes are of a\r\nvery short duration. The only remedy the employers have, the only\r\nsafeguard against encroachments from their men, is their power of\r\nobtaining the services of foreigners, for a short time. The difficulty\r\nof stopping business there is very great; the injury of delay very\r\nheavy: but the wages of labour are so good that there is less cause for\r\ndiscontent on the part of the workmen than elsewhere. All the strikes I\r\nheard of were on the question of hours, not of wages.\r\n\r\nThe employers are, of course, casting about to see how they can help\r\nthemselves; and, as all are not wise and experienced, it is natural that\r\nsome should talk of laws to prohibit Trades Unions. There is no harm in\r\ntheir talking of such; for the matter will never get beyond\r\ntalk;--unless, indeed, the combinations of operatives should assume any\r\nforms, or comprehend any principles inconsistent with the republican\r\nspirit. The majority will not vote for any law which shall restrain any\r\nnumber of artisans from agreeing for what price they will sell their\r\nlabour; though I heard several learned gentlemen agreeing, at dinner one\r\nday, that there ought to be such laws. On my objecting that the interest\r\nof the parties concerned would, especially in a free and rising country,\r\nsettle all questions between labour and capital with more precision,\r\nfairness, and peace, than any law, it was pleaded that intimidation and\r\noutrage were practised by those who combined against those who would not\r\njoin them. I found, on inquiry, that there is an ample provision of laws\r\nagainst intimidation and outrage; but that it is difficult to get them\r\nexecuted. If so, it would be also difficult to execute laws against\r\ncombinations of workmen, supposing them obtained: and the grievance does\r\nnot lie in the combination complained of, but somewhere else. The remedy\r\nis, (if there be indeed intimidation and outrage,) not in passing more\r\nlaws, to be in like manner defied, while sufficient already exist; but\r\nin enlightening the parties on the subjects of law and social\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nOne day, in going down Broadway, New York, the carriage in which I was,\r\nstopped for some time, in consequence of an immense procession on the\r\nside-walk having attracted the attention of all the drivers within\r\nsight. The marching gentlemen proceeded on their way, with an easy air\r\nof gentility. Banners were interposed at intervals; and, on examining\r\nthese, I could scarcely believe my eyes. They told me that this was a\r\nprocession of the journeymen mechanics of New York. Surely never were\r\nsuch dandy mechanics seen; with sleek coats, glossy hats, gay\r\nwatch-guards, and doe-skin gloves!\r\n\r\nI rejoice to have seen this sight. I had other opportunities of\r\nwitnessing the prosperity of their employers; so that I could be fairly\r\npleased at theirs. There need be no fear for the interests of either,\r\nwhile the natural laws of demand and supply must protect each from any\r\nserious encroachment by the other. If they will only respect the law,\r\ntheir temporary disagreement, and apparent opposition of interests will\r\nend in being mere readjustments of the terms on which they are to pursue\r\ntheir common welfare.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Hamilton's Report on Manufactures. 1790.\r\n\r\n[6] The following sketch of the aspect of the south-eastern States is a\r\nvery faithful one. The error of the writer is in supposing that such a\r\ncondition could be brought about by the tariff, rather than by the\r\nnecessary operation of the slavery system, by which the children of the\r\nthird and fourth generations are always reduced to sigh for the\r\ncomparative prosperity of their fathers.\r\n\r\n\"These views of the degradation of the southern States receive a\r\nmelancholy and impressive confirmation from the general aspect and\r\ncondition of the country, viewed in contrast with its former prosperity.\r\nIf the ancestors of this generation could rise from the grave, and\r\nrevisit the scenes of their former usefulness, they would not hesitate\r\nto pronounce that the hand of oppression had fallen heavily upon the\r\ninheritance of their children. They would be utterly at a loss to\r\naccount for the change everywhere exhibited, upon any other supposition.\r\n\r\n\"With natural advantages more bountiful than were ever dispensed by a\r\nkind Providence to any other people upon the face of the globe, they\r\nwould behold, from the mountains of the sea-coast, one unbroken scene of\r\ncheerless stagnation and premature decay. With one of the most valuable\r\nstaples that ever blessed the labours of the husbandman, and swelled the\r\nsails of a prosperous and enriching commerce, they would find that our\r\nestates are, with a steady and fatal proclivity, depreciating in value,\r\nour fields becoming waste, and our cities desolate. With habits of\r\nindustry and economy which have no example in our former history, they\r\nwould find the heirs of the largest inheritances generally involved in\r\nembarrassments, and many of them irretrievably ruined. Wherever they\r\nmight cast their eyes, they would find melancholy evidences that the\r\nwithering blasts of an unsparing despotism had passed over the land,\r\nblighting the choicest bounties of Providence, and leaving scarcely a\r\nsolitary memorial of our former prosperity. They would look in vain for\r\nthe animating scenes of successful industry, for the wealth and comforts\r\nof a thriving population, and for those mansions of hospitality which\r\nwere once the seats of elegance, and the abodes of\r\ncheerfulness.\"--_Southern Review, Nov. 1828._ p. 613.\r\n\r\n[7] The deposits in the Lowell Savings' Bank for 1834, were upwards of\r\n114,000 dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE.\r\n\r\n     \"He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies: I\r\n     understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a\r\n     fourth for England: and other ventures he hath.\"\r\n\r\n    _Merchant of Venice._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no need to say much about the extent of the Commerce of the\r\nUnited States, since it is already the admiration of Europe, and its\r\nhistory is before every one in the shape of figures.

The balance has been nearly restored by the prospect of\r\nthe expiration of the protective system; and both commerce and\r\nmanufactures are again rapidly on the increase. The foreign tonnage of\r\nMassachusetts has increased fifty-three per cent. within the last five\r\nyears, though, owing to a new mode of ship-construction, twice the\r\nquantity is stowed in the same nominal tonnage.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the south-west was in high prosperity when I was there.\r\nWhen I was at Mobile, in April 1835, I was informed that 183,000 bales\r\nof cotton had been brought down into Mobile since the beginning of the\r\nyear.[8] A friend of mine, engaged in commerce there, told me of the\r\nenormous interest on money then obtainable. Eight per cent. is the legal\r\ninterest; but double is easily to be had. Another, a wealthy gentleman\r\nof New Orleans, speculates largely every season, for the sake of\r\nsomething to do, and makes a fortune each time, by lending out at high\r\ninterest. He declares that he never loses, and never fails to gain\r\nlargely; the commerce is so flourishing, and the demand for capital so\r\nintense. This is the region in which to witness the full absurdity of\r\nusury laws. They are evaded, as often as convenient, and serve no other\r\npurpose than to annex a kind of disgrace to a deed which must of\r\nnecessity be done,--loaning out money at higher than the legal interest.\r\nThe same evasion takes place in Massachusetts, where the legal interest\r\nis six per cent. The interest there, as elsewhere, rises just as high as\r\nthe demand for money must naturally bring it.\r\n\r\nI was acquainted with a gentleman who had lost seventy-five thousand\r\ndollars in an unfortunate speculation, and who expected to retrieve the\r\nwhole the next season. The price of everything was rising. For my own\r\nshare, I had to pay twelve dollars for my passage from Mobile to New\r\nOrleans: and twenty-five per cent. higher for my voyage up the\r\nMississippi than if I had gone the preceding year. The fare I paid was\r\nfifty dollars. These two fares were the only exceptions to the\r\nremarkable cheapness of travelling in the United States and these would\r\nnot be considered high anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland river, on which stands Nashville, the capital of\r\nTennessee, and which empties itself into the Ohio, has scarcely been\r\nheard of in England; yet, of all the tobacco consumed in the world,\r\none-seventh goes down this river. I ascended it in a very small\r\nsteam-boat, one of twelve, six large and six small, then perpetually\r\nnavigating it, and carrying cotton, tobacco, and passengers. Of these\r\nboats, one had carried, the preceding year, three hundred and sixty\r\nbales of cotton, of the value of three hundred and sixty thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the northern ports, and observe the variety, as well as\r\nthe extent of their commerce, there seems good ground for the\r\nexpectation expressed to me by many American merchants, that the English\r\nlanguage will finally become familiar, not only over all the east, but\r\nover all the globe.\r\n\r\nSalem, Massachusetts, is a remarkable place. This \"city of peace\" will\r\nbe better known hereafter for its commerce than for its witch-tragedy.\r\nIt has a population of 14,000; and more wealth in proportion to its\r\npopulation than perhaps any town in the world. Its commerce is\r\nspeculative, but vast and successful. It is a frequent circumstance that\r\na ship goes out without a cargo, for a voyage round the world. In such a\r\ncase, the captain puts his elder children to school, takes his wife and\r\nyounger children, and starts for some semi-barbarous place, where he\r\nprocures some odd kind of cargo, which he exchanges with advantage for\r\nanother, somewhere else; and so goes trafficking round the world,\r\nbringing home a freight of the highest value.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising merchants of Salem are hoping to appropriate a large\r\nshare of the whale fishery; and their ships are penetrating the northern\r\nice. They are favourite customers in the Russian ports, and are familiar\r\nwith the Swedish and Norwegian coasts. They have nearly as much commerce\r\nwith Bremen as with Liverpool. They speak of Fayal and the other Azores\r\nas if they were close at hand. The fruits of the Mediterranean countries\r\nare on every table. They have a large acquaintance at Cairo. They know\r\nNapoleon's grave at St. Helena, and have wild tales to tell of\r\nMosambique and Madagasca, and store of ivory to show from thence. They\r\nspeak of the power of the king of Muscat, and are sensible of the riches\r\nof the south-east coast of Arabia. It entered some wise person's head, a\r\nfew seasons ago, to export ice to India. The loss, by melting, of the\r\nfirst cargo, was one fourth. The rest was sold at six cents per lb. When\r\nthe value of this new import became known, it was in great request; and\r\nthe latter sales have been almost instantaneous, at ten cents per pound:\r\nso that it is now a good speculation to send ice 12,000 miles to\r\nsupersede salt-petre in cooling sherbet. The young ladies of America\r\nhave rare shells from Ceylon in their cabinets; and their drawing-rooms\r\nare decked with Chinese copies of English prints. I was amused with two:\r\nthe scene of Hero swooning in the church, from 'Much Ado about Nothing;'\r\nand Shakspeare between Tragedy and Comedy. The faces of Comedy and of\r\nBeatrice from the hands of Chinese! I should not have found out the\r\nplace of their second birth but for a piece of unfortunate\r\nforeshortening in each. I observed to a friend, one day, upon the beauty\r\nof all the new cordage that met my eye, silky and bright. He told me\r\nthat it was made of Manilla hemp, of the value of which the British seem\r\nto be unaware; though it has been introduced into England. He mentioned\r\nthat he had been the first importer of it. Eight years before, 600 bales\r\nper annum were imported: now, 20,000. The merchants doubt whether\r\nAustralia will be able to surmount the disadvantage of a deficiency of\r\nnavigable rivers. They have hopes of Van Diemen's Land, think well of\r\nSingapore, and acknowledge great expectations from New Zealand. Any body\r\nwill give you anecdotes from Canton, and descriptions of the Society\r\nand Sandwich Islands. They often slip up the western coasts of their two\r\ncontinents; bring furs from the back regions of their own wide land;\r\nglance up at the Andes on their return; double Cape Horn; touch at the\r\nports of Brazil and Guiana; look about them in the West Indies, feeling\r\nthere almost at home; and land, some fair morning, at Salem, and walk\r\nhome as if they had done nothing very remarkable.\r\n\r\nSuch is the commerce of Salem, in its most meagre outline. Some\r\nillustration of it may be seen in the famous Salem Museum. In regard to\r\nthis institution, a very harmless kind of monopoly exists. No one is\r\nadmitted of the museum proprietary body who has not doubled the Capes\r\nHorn and Good Hope. Everybody is freely admitted to visit the\r\ninstitution; and any one may contribute, either curiosities or the means\r\nof procuring them; but the doubling of the Capes is an unalterable\r\ncondition of the honour of being a member. This has the effect of\r\npreserving a salutary interest among the members of the society, and\r\nrespect among those who cannot be admitted. The society have laid by\r\n20,000 dollars, after having built a handsome hall for the reception of\r\ntheir curiosities; but a far more important benefit is that it has now\r\nbecome discreditable to return from a long voyage without some novel\r\ncontribution to the Museum. This sets people inquiring what is already\r\nthere, and ensures a perpetual and valuable accretion. I am glad to have\r\nseen there some Oriental curiosities, which might never otherwise have\r\nblessed my sight: especially some wonderful figures, made of an unknown\r\nmixed metal, dug up in Java, being caricatures of the old Dutch soldiers\r\nsent to guard the first colonies. A reasonably grave person might stand\r\nlaughing before these for half a day. I had no idea there had been so\r\nmuch humour in the Java people.\r\n\r\nThe stability of the commercial interest in the United States was put to\r\nthe test by the great fire at New York. All the circumstances regarding\r\nthis fire were remarkable; no one more so than that not a single failure\r\ntook place in consequence.\r\n\r\nFor many days preceding this fire, the weather had been intensely cold,\r\nthe thermometer standing at Boston 17 degrees below zero. On the Sunday\r\nbefore, (13th of December 1835,) I went to hear the Seamen's friend,\r\nFather Taylor, as he is called, preach at the Sailors' Chapel, in\r\nBoston. His eloquence is of a peculiar kind, especially in his prayers,\r\nwhich are absolutely importunate with regard to even external objects of\r\ndesire. Part of his prayer this day was, \"Give us water, water! The\r\nbrooks refuse to murmur, and the streams are dead. Break up the\r\nfountains: open the secret springs that thy hand knoweth, and give us\r\nwater, water! Let us not perish by a famine of water, or a deluge of\r\nconflagration; for we dread the careless wandering spark.\" I was never\r\nbefore aware of the fear of fire entertained during these intense\r\nfrosts. It is a reasonable fear. A gentleman, bent upon daily bathing,\r\nwas seen one morning disconsolately returning from the river side; he\r\nhad employed three men to break the ice, and they could not get at a\r\ndrop of water. What hope was there in case of fire?\r\n\r\nThe New York fire broke out at eight in the evening of Wednesday, the\r\n16th of December. Every one knows the leading facts, that 52 or 54 acres\r\nwere laid waste; many public buildings destroyed, and property to the\r\namount of 18,000,000 of dollars.\r\n\r\nSeveral particulars were given to me on the spot, three months\r\nafterwards, by some observers and some sufferers. At a boarding-house\r\nin Broadway, where some friends of mine were residing, there were\r\nseveral merchants, some with their wives, who dined that day in good\r\nspirits, and, as they afterwards believed, perfectly content with their\r\nworldly condition and prospects. At eight o'clock there was an alarm of\r\nfire. It was thought nothing of; alarms of fire being as frequent as day\r\nand night in New York. After a while, a merchant of the company was sent\r\nfor, and some little anxiety was expressed. Two or three persons looked\r\nout of the upper windows, but it was a night of such still, deep frost,\r\nthat the reflection in the atmosphere was much less glaring than might\r\nhave been expected. Another and then another gentleman was sent for.\r\nNews came of the absolute lack of water, and that there was no gunpowder\r\nin the city--none nearer than Brooklyn. The gentlemen all rushed out;\r\nthe anxious ladies went from the windows to the fire-side; from the\r\nfire-side to the windows. One gentleman and lady in the house, a young\r\nGerman couple, just arrived, and knowing scarcely a word of English,\r\nwere unaware of all this. None of their chattels, not even the lady's\r\nclothes, had been removed from their store in Pearl Street, where lay\r\nher books, music, wardrobe, and property of every sort. Pretty early in\r\nthe morning the poor gentleman was roused from his slumbers, could not\r\ncomprehend the cause, went down to Pearl Street, and, amidst the\r\namazement and desolation, just contrived to save his account-books, and\r\nnothing else. In the morning, the lady was destitute of even a change of\r\nraiment, in a foreign country, of whose language she could not speak one\r\nword. There were kind hearts all around her, however, and she was quite\r\ncheerful when I saw her, a few weeks afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house was so worn, weary, and cold, by three in the\r\nmorning, that she retired to her room; desiring her domestics to call\r\nher if the fire should catch Broad Street; in which case, it would be\r\ntime to be packing up plate, and moving furniture. In a little while,\r\nthere was a tap at her door. Broad Street was not on fire, however; but\r\nsome of the gentlemen had come home, smoked and frost-bitten, and eager\r\nfor help and warm water. One gentleman, who had nothing more at stake\r\nthan three chests of Scotch linen, (valuable because home-woven,) of\r\nwhich he saved one, losing a superb Spanish cloak in the process, was\r\ndesirous that his wife should see the spectacle of the conflagration.\r\nShe walked down to the scene of the fire with him, after midnight. They\r\ntook their stand in a square, in the centre of which an immense quantity\r\nof costly goods was heaped up. It was strange and vexatious to see the\r\nhavoc that was made among beautiful things;--cachemere shawls strewing\r\nthe ground; horses' feet swathed in lace veils; French silks getting\r\nentangled and torn in the wheels of the carts. The lady picked up shawls\r\nand veils; and when her husband asked her where she proposed to put\r\nthem, could only throw them down again. After she had left the place,\r\nthe houses caught fire, all round the square, fell in, and burned the\r\ncostly goods in one grand bonfire.\r\n\r\nThere had been occasional quarrels between the merchants and the carmen.\r\nThe carmen conceived themselves injured by certain merchants. Whether\r\nthey had reason for this belief or not, I cannot pretend to say. They\r\nthought this a time for revenge. Some crossed their arms, as they leaned\r\nagainst their carts, and refused to stir a step, unless twenty dollars a\r\nload were paid them on the spot. Some few refused to help at all. This\r\nmust have been a far more deadly sorrow to the sufferers than the ruin\r\nthe fire was working. One carman was very provoking when a French\r\ngentleman had not a moment to lose in saving his stock. The gentleman\r\nsaid coolly at last, taking out his money, \"For what sum will you sell\r\nyour horse and cart?\" The temptation was irresistible to the carman. He\r\nnamed 500 dollars for his sorry hack and small vehicle, and was paid on\r\nthe instant. The French gentleman saved goods to the amount of 100,000\r\ndollars. It was a good bargain for both.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning, when the necessary explosions had checked the\r\nfire, the gentlemen of the household I have mentioned, being completely\r\nruined, for anything they knew to the contrary, came home; and the\r\nladies went to bed. Some of the least interested consulted what should\r\nbe done at dinner-time; whether the company in general could bear the\r\nsubject; whether it was best to talk or be silent. It was a languid,\r\nsorrowful meal: the gentlemen looking haggard; their ladies anxious. The\r\nnext day, they were able to talk,--to describe, to relate anecdotes, and\r\nspeculate on consequences. The third day, all were nearly as cheerful as\r\nif nothing had happened: though some had lost all, and others, they knew\r\nnot how much.\r\n\r\nThe report of the fire spread as news through the upper part of the\r\ncity, the next morning. Some friends of mine had walked home from a\r\nvisit, upwards of a mile, at eleven o'clock, and neither heard nor seen\r\nanything of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe larger proportion of the New York merchants were thus deprived at a\r\nstroke of their buildings, stocks, in many cases of all books and\r\npapers, and, lastly, of the benefit of insurance. The insurance\r\ncompanies were plunged in almost a general insolvency. The only relief\r\nproposed, or that could be offered, was an extension of time, without\r\ninterest, to the debtors of the government for payment of bonds given to\r\nsecure the duties upon goods recently imported: and this small relief\r\ncould not be obtained till too late to be of much use.\r\n\r\nHappily, the fire occurred at one of the least busy seasons of the year.\r\nThe merchants could concert together for the saving of their credit: and\r\nthey did it to some purpose. Their credit sustained the shock of all\r\nthis confusion, uncertainty, and dismay. The conduct of the merchants\r\nwho had not directly suffered, and of the banks, was admirable. They\r\nthrew aside all their usual caution, and dispensed help and\r\naccommodation with the last degree of liberality. The consequence was,\r\nthat not one house failed. It seems now as if the commercial credit of\r\nNew York could stand any shock short of an earthquake, like that of\r\nLisbon.\r\n\r\nSome merchants had the unexpected pleasure of finding themselves richer\r\nthan they were before. One was travelling in Europe with his lady, when\r\nthe news overtook him that the hundred and fifty stores in which he had\r\nproperty were all burned down. He wrote that he and his lady were\r\nhastening to Havre, on their way home, where they must live in the most\r\neconomical and laborious manner, to repair their fortunes. With such\r\nintentions they crossed the Atlantic; and on landing were met by the\r\nintelligence that they had become very wealthy, from their ground lots\r\nhaving sold for more than ground, stores, and stock, were worth before.\r\n\r\nI saw the fifty-two acres of ruins in the following April. We traversed\r\nwhat had been streets, and climbed the ruins of the Exchange. The\r\npedestal of Hamilton's statue was standing, strewed round with fragments\r\nof burnt calicoes, which people were disinterring. There was a litter of\r\nstone pannels, broken columns, and cornices. Bushels of coffee paved\r\nour way. A boy presented me with a half-fused watch-key from the cellar\r\nof what had been a jeweller's store. The blackened ruins of a church\r\nfrowned over all. The most singular spectacle was a store, standing\r\nalone and unharmed, amidst the desolation. It belonged to a Jew, was\r\nfire-proof, and contained hay, not a blade of which was singed. This\r\nsquare-fronted, elongated, ugly building, standing obliquely, and as\r\nclean as if smoke had never touched it, had a most saucy appearance: and\r\nso it might, so many erections, equally called fire-proof, having\r\ndisappeared, while it alone remained.\r\n\r\nBy the next July, the entire area was covered with new erections; and\r\nlong before this, doubtless, all is to the outward eye, as if no fire\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nBut for the testimony afforded by this event, of the substantial credit\r\nin New York, the enormous prices given for land,--the above-mentioned\r\nground lots, for instance,--might cause a suspicion that there was much\r\nwild speculation. I trust it is not so. The eagerness for land is,\r\nhowever, extraordinary. A lady sold an estate in the neighbourhood of\r\nNew York, for what she and her friends considered a large sum; and a few\r\nweeks after she had concluded the bargain, and soon after the\r\ndestruction of eighteen millions of the wealth of the city, she found\r\nshe might have obtained three times the amount for which she had sold\r\nher estate. The whole south end of the city is being rapidly turned into\r\nstores; and it is obvious that the mercantile princes of this emporium\r\nhave no idea of their conquests being bounded by any circumstance short\r\nof the limits of the globe.\r\n\r\nIs there anything to be learned here, as well as to admire? any\r\ninference to be drawn for the benefit of other nations?\r\n\r\nAn English member of parliament wrote to a friend residing in one of the\r\nAmerican ports, inquiring whether this friend could suggest any course\r\nof parliamentary action by which the commerce of England, or of both\r\ncountries, could be benefited. The American replied by urging his friend\r\nto work incessantly at a repeal of the corn laws, and in any way which\r\nmay keep the United States continually before the eyes of the commercial\r\nrulers of Great Britain. \"You talk,\" said he, \"of your commercial\r\narrangements with Portugal. Well and good! but what is Portugal? She has\r\ntwo millions of priests and beggars; and at the end of the century she\r\nwill have two millions of priests and beggars still. What will the\r\nwealth and productions of the United States be then?\" If the United\r\nStates have now 18,000,000 of people, and their population is increasing\r\nat an unexampled rate,--a free and an opulent population,--the interest\r\nof Great Britain is plain;--to have a primary regard to the United\r\nStates in the arrangement of her commercial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENCY.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty of this great question, now one of the most\r\nprominent in the United States, is indicated by the fact that, while\r\nthe practice of banking is essential to a manufacturing and commercial\r\nnation, a perfect system of banking remains to be discovered.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the question of the Currency has never yet\r\nbeen practically mastered in the countries of the Old World; that in\r\nAmerica it has fallen into the hands of a young and inexperienced\r\npeople; that it is implicated with constitutional questions, and has to\r\nbe reconciled with democratic principles, it will not be expected that a\r\npassing stranger will be able to present a very clear view of its\r\npresent aspect, or any decided opinion upon difficulties which perplex\r\nthe wisest heads in the country. The mere history of banking in the\r\nUnited States would fill more than a volume: and the speculations which\r\narise out of it, a library.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there was an early split into parties on the\r\nsubject of the constitutionality of a national bank. Washington\r\nrequested the opinions of his cabinet upon it in writing; and Hamilton\r\ngave his in favour of the constitutionality of a national bank: Edmund\r\nRandolph and Jefferson against it. The question has been stirred from\r\ntime to time since; while Hamilton's opinions have been acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe ground of objection is a very strong one. It lies in the provision\r\nthat \"all powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution,\r\nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the\r\npeople.\" No power to establish corporations is, in any case, delegated\r\nby the constitution to the United States; nor does it appear to be\r\ncountenanced by any fair construction of the permissions under which its\r\ntransaction of the general business is carried on.\r\n\r\nThe answer to this is, that the supreme law of the country may give a\r\nlegal or artificial capacity, (distinct from the natural,) to one or\r\nmore persons, in relation to the objects committed to the management of\r\nthe government: in other words, that the government has sovereign power\r\nwith regard to the objects confided to it; all the limitations of the\r\nconstitution having relation to the number of those objects. This was\r\nHamilton's ground; and this is, I believe, the ground which has been\r\ntaken since by those who shared his opinions on the main question. To me\r\nit appears as unsatisfactory as any other mode of begging the question.\r\nIf the power of making corporations is to be assumed by the general\r\ngovernment, on the ground of its being implied, the whole country might\r\nbe covered with corporations, to which should be entrusted the discharge\r\nof any function exercised by the general government.\r\n\r\nIn countries differently governed from the United States, it appears as\r\nif it would be most reasonable either to have the currency made a\r\nnational affair, transacted wholly by the government, on determined\r\nprinciples, or to leave banking entirely free. In neither case,\r\nprobably, would the evils be so great as those which have happened under\r\nthe mixture of the two systems. But in the United States, the committing\r\nthe management of the currency to the general government is now wholly\r\nout of the question. Free banking will be the method, some time or\r\nother; but not yet. There is not yet knowledge enough; nor freedom\r\nenough of production and commerce to render such a policy safe.\r\nMeantime, various doctrines are afloat. Some persons are for no banking\r\nwhatsoever: but mere money-lending by individuals. Some are for the\r\nabolition of paper-money, and the establishment of one public bank of\r\ndeposit and transfer in each State. Some are for private banking only,\r\nwith or without paper money. Some are for State incorporations, with no\r\ncentral bank. Others are for restoring the United States Bank.\r\n\r\nNo objections against banking and paper-money altogether will avail\r\nanything, while commerce is conducted on its present principles. It\r\nanswers no practical purpose to object to any useful thing on the ground\r\nof its abuse: and while the commerce of the United States is daily on\r\nthe increase, and the only check on its prosperity is the want of\r\ncapital, there is no possibility of a return to the use of private\r\nmoney-lending and rouleaus.\r\n\r\nThe use of small notes may well and easily be discontinued. The\r\nexperiment has been tried with success in Virginia, Maryland, and\r\nPennsylvania. The prohibition might, perhaps, be carried as high as to\r\nnotes of twenty dollars. There seems no adequate reason for the public\r\nbeing, further than this, deprived of the convenience of a\r\nrepresentative of cash; a convenience so great that there is much more\r\nprobability that the ingenious Americans will devise some method of\r\npractically insuring its convertibility, than that they will surrender\r\nits use. It has often occurred to me that out of the currency troubles\r\nof the United States, might arise such a discovery of the true principle\r\n(which yet lies hidden) of insuring the convertibility, or other\r\nlimitation, of a paper currency, as may be a blessing to the whole\r\ncommercial world. This is an enterprise worthy of their ingenuity; and\r\none which seems of probable achievement, when we remember how the\r\nAmerican merchants are pressed for capital, and how all-important to\r\nthem is the soundness of their credit. The principle lies somewhere, if\r\nit could but be found: and none are more likely to discover it than\r\nthey.\r\n\r\nPrivate banking is, in the present state of affairs, necessary and\r\ninevitable; so that there is little use in arguments for or against it.\r\nCapital is grievously wanted, in all the commercial cities. There must\r\nbe some place of resort for small amounts, and for foreign capital,\r\nwhence money may issue to supply the need of commercial men. There must,\r\nin other words, be money stores; and, in the absence of others, private\r\nbanks must serve the purpose. The amount of good or harm which, in the\r\npresent state of things, they are able to do, depends mainly on the\r\ndiscretion or indiscretion of their customers; who, in common prudence,\r\nmust look well whom they trust.\r\n\r\nAs for State incorporations, it cannot be said that they are absolutely\r\nnecessary; though the arguments in favour of their expediency are very\r\nstrong. More and more money is perpetually required for the transaction\r\nof commercial business; and in a different ratio from that required by\r\nthe affairs of farmers and planters; since the latter receive their\r\nreturns quickly; while the merchants of the sea-board have theirs\r\ndelayed for long periods, and consequently require a much larger amount\r\nof capital. These larger amounts must come mainly from abroad, whence\r\nmoney can be had at four and five per cent. interest; while at home,\r\nfrom six to twelve per cent. is paid, even while foreign capital is\r\nflowing in. It is obvious that this foreign capital will enter much more\r\nabundantly through the credit of a State bank than through private\r\nbanks. Small amounts of capital, dispersed and comparatively\r\nunproductive, will also be more readily brought together, to be applied\r\nwhere most needed, in a State bank, than among many small firms. The\r\nStates of New York and Pennsylvania have carried on their improvements,\r\ntheir canals and rail-roads, as well as much of their commerce, by means\r\nof foreign capital; and the surpassing prosperity of those States may be\r\nconsidered owing, in a great degree, to this practice. The\r\nincorporation of a bank is not always to be considered in the light of a\r\nmonopoly; it may be the reverse. It may enable a number of individuals,\r\nby no means the most wealthy in the community, to compete, by an union\r\nof forces, with the most wealthy. Corporations may be multiplied, as\r\noccasion arises, and, by competition, give the public the benefit of the\r\ngreatest possible amount of service done at the least cost.\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading arguments in favour of State Banks. The objections\r\nto them are in part applicable to faulty methods of incorporation, and\r\nnot to the principle itself. The special exemption from liabilities to\r\nwhich individuals are subject; the imposing of such inhibitions\r\nelsewhere as render the affair a monopoly; the making responsibility a\r\nmere abstraction, are great, but perhaps avoidable evils. So are the\r\nmethods by which charters have been obtained and renewed; the method of\r\n\"log-rolling\" bills through the legislature; and other such\r\ncorruption.[9]\r\n\r\nAn objection less easily disposed of is, that by the creation of any\r\ngreat moneyed power, means are afforded of controlling the fortunes of\r\nindividuals, and of influencing the press and the political\r\nconstituency. If these objections cannot be obviated, they are fatal to\r\nbanking corporations. If, however, any means can be devised, either by\r\ncausing a sufficient publicity of proceedings, or by granting charters\r\nfor a short term, renewable on strict conditions, or by any other plan\r\nfor establishing a true responsibility, of uniting the benefits of\r\nincorporated banks with republican principles, it seems as if it would\r\nbe a great benefit to all parties in the community.\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion which has made the most noise in the world, is\r\nabout a National Bank.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been contemplated, in the first instance, to place\r\nthe currency of the United States under the control of the general\r\ngovernment; according to the spirit of the provisions of the\r\nconstitution, that Congress should have power \"to coin money, regulate\r\nthe value thereof, and of foreign coin:\" but without affording to\r\nCongress any power to control the fortunes of individuals, as may be\r\ndone by certain banking operations. The state of the colonial currency\r\nhad been deplorable.[10] The object now was to substitute a uniform and\r\nsubstantial currency, instead of the false representatives which had\r\nbeen in use: and to put it out of the power of the States to alter the\r\nterms of contracts by taking advantage of the faults of the currency.\r\nNobody would take the continental bills; and gold and silver were\r\ndeficient. A national bank was the resource; and the old United States\r\nBank was chartered in 1791; it being ascertained that its issues were\r\nbased on real capital, and a strict watch being kept over its\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThis bank was believed to be wanted for another purpose;--to watch over\r\nand control the State Banks. It was not the first institution of the\r\nkind in the United States. The Bank of North America had been chartered\r\nin 1781, under the authority of the Continental Congress: but by soon\r\naccepting a charter from the Legislature of Pennsylvania, it ceased to\r\nbe a national, and afforded the precedent of a State Bank. New York and\r\nMassachusetts had soon State Banks also. They were prudently conducted;\r\nand their notes presently banished the coin. The power of Congress over\r\nthe currency was gone. All that could be done now was for the National\r\nBank to control the State Banks, and keep their issues within bounds, as\r\nwell as it could.\r\n\r\nOccasional disorders happened from the misconduct of country banks,\r\nprior to 1811. The renewal of the charter of the United States Bank was\r\nthen refused. The government was pressed by the evils of war; and the\r\ncheck of the superintendence of the Bank being withdrawn, the local\r\nbanks, out of New England, came to the agreement, (too senseless to be\r\never repeated,) to suspend specie payments. All issued what kind and\r\nquantity of paper pleased themselves, till above twice the amount of\r\nmoney needed was abroad; and the notes were in some States five, in\r\nothers ten, in others twenty, below par. The New England people,\r\nmeantime, used convertible paper only; and under the law which provides\r\nthat all duties, imposts, and excises should be uniform throughout the\r\nStates, were thus compelled to pay one tenth more to the revenue\r\nofficers than the people of New York, who used the depreciated currency:\r\nand one-fifth more than the Baltimore merchants.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not last. A national bank was again\r\nestablished, in 1816, for the purpose of controlling the local banks.\r\nIts charter was for twenty years, with a capital of 35,000,000 dollars,\r\nto which the federal government subscribed one fifth. Its notes were\r\nmade receivable for any debt due to the United States.\r\n\r\nIts purpose was presently answered. The local banks had, in three years,\r\nresumed cash payments. The management of the United States Bank, during\r\nthe rest of its term, has been, upon the whole, prudent and moderate.\r\nThat a power has not been abused is not, however, a reason for its\r\ncontinued exercise, if it be really unconstitutional. President Jackson\r\nthinks, and the majority thinks with him, that it is contrary to the\r\nspirit of the constitution, (as it is certainly unauthorised by its\r\nletter,) that any institution should have the power, unchecked for a\r\nlong term of years, of affecting the affairs of individuals, from the\r\nfurther corners of Maine or Missouri, down to the shores of the Gulf of\r\nMexico; of influencing elections; of biassing the press; and of acting\r\nstrongly either with or against the administration. The majority\r\nconsiders, that if the United States Bank has great power for good, it\r\nhas also great power for harm; and that the general government cannot be\r\nsecure of working naturally in its limited functions, while this great\r\npower subsists, to be either its enemy or its ally.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be proved by the charges brought against the late Bank by\r\nPresident Jackson. Whether they are true or false, (and the gravest of\r\nthem do not appear to have been substantiated,) they indicate that power\r\nis in the hands of a central institution, which no federal\r\nestablishment ought to have, otherwise than by the express permission of\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nAs for President Jackson's mode of proceeding against the Bank,--it is\r\nan affair of merely temporary interest, unless he should be found to\r\nhave exceeded the authority conferred on him by his office. He does seem\r\nto have done so, in one particular, at least. His first declaration\r\nagainst the renewal of the charter, was honest and manly. His\r\nre-election, after having made this avowal, was a sufficient evidence of\r\nthe desire of the majority to extinguish the Bank. It was, no doubt, in\r\nreliance on the will of the majority, thus indicated, that the President\r\nremoved the deposits in a peculiarly high-handed manner; and also\r\nexercised the veto, when the two Houses had passed a bill to renew the\r\ncharter of the United States Bank.\r\n\r\nWith the last of these measures, no one has any right to quarrel. He\r\nexercised a constitutional power, according to his long-declared\r\nconvictions. His sudden removal of the deposits is not to be so easily\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nThe President has the power of removing his Secretaries from office, and\r\nof appointing others, whose appointment must be sanctioned by the\r\nSenate. The Secretaries of State are enjoined by law to execute such\r\norders as shall be imposed on them by the President of the United\r\nStates:--all the Secretaries but the Secretary of the Treasury. In his\r\ncase, no such specification is made; obviously because it would not be\r\nwise to put the whole power of the Treasury into the hands of the\r\nPresident. President Jackson, however, contrived to obtain this power by\r\nusing with adroitness his other power of removal from office. Mr. Duane\r\nwas appointed Secretary of the Treasury on the 29th of May, 1833; his\r\npredecessor having been offered a higher office. It is known that the\r\npredecessor had given his opinion in the cabinet against removing the\r\nTreasury deposits from the Bank; and that Mr. Duane was an acknowledged\r\nenemy of the Bank. On the 3rd of June, the President opened to the new\r\nSecretary his scheme of removing the deposits. Mr. Duane was opposed to\r\nthe act, as being a violation of the government contract with the Bank.\r\nHe refused to sign the necessary order. While he was still in office, on\r\nthe 20th of September, the intended removal of the deposits was\r\nannounced in the government newspaper. On the 23rd, Mr. Duane was\r\ndismissed from office; and Mr. Taney, who had previously promised to\r\nsign the order, was installed in the office. On the 26th, the official\r\norder for the removal of the deposits was given. No plea of impending\r\ndanger to the national funds, if such could have been substantiated,\r\ncould justify so high-handed a deed as this. No such plea has been\r\nsubstantiated; and the act remains open to strong censure.\r\n\r\nJust before the expiration of its charter, the United States Bank\r\naccepted a charter from the Legislature of Pennsylvania. It remains to\r\nbe seen what effects will arise from the operation of the most powerful\r\nState Bank which has yet existed.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is to keep a sound currency, in the absence of an\r\ninstitution, believed to be unconstitutional, but hitherto found the\r\nonly means of establishing order and safety in this most important\r\nbranch of economy. Here is a deficiency, which cannot but be the cause\r\nof much evil and perplexity. It must be supplied, either by increased\r\nknowledge and improved philosophy and practice among the people, or by\r\nan amendment of the Constitution. Meanwhile, it is only time and energy\r\nlost to insist upon the return to a mere metallic currency. Society\r\ncannot be set back to a condition which could dispense with so great an\r\nimprovement as paper-money, with all its abuses, undoubtedly is.\r\n\r\nThe singular order which last year emanated from the Treasury,\r\ncompelling the payments for the public lands to be made in specie, will\r\nnot have the effect of making the people in love with a metallic\r\ncurrency. If this measure is intended to be an obstacle to the purchase\r\nof large quantities of land, or virtually to raise the price,--these are\r\naffairs with which the Treasury has nothing to do. If it is intended\r\nmerely to compel cash payments, as far as the administration has power\r\nto do so, it seems a pity that those who undertake to meddle with the\r\ncurrency should not know better what they are about. The scarcity of\r\nmoney in the eastern States has been well nigh ruinous, while large\r\namounts of specie have been accumulated in the west, where they are not\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThe mischief thus caused has been much increased by the injudicious\r\nmethod in which the deposits have been distributed among the States,\r\naccording to the Deposit Bill of the session of 1836. The details of the\r\nextraordinary state of the money-market in America, last year, are too\r\nwell known on both sides of the water, to need to be repeated here.\r\n\r\nOne principle stands out conspicuously from the history of the last few\r\nyears: that no President or Secretary should be allowed the opportunity\r\nof \"taking the responsibility\" of meddling with the currency of the\r\ncountry: in other words, the taxation should be reduced, as soon as in\r\nequity and convenience it can be done, so as to bring down the revenue\r\nto a proportion with the wants of the government. If the general\r\ngovernment is to have anything to do with the currency at all, it should\r\nbe by such business being made a separate constitutional function. To\r\nlet the Treasury overflow,--and leave its overflowings to be managed at\r\nthe discretion of one public servant, removable by one other, is a\r\npolicy as absurd as dangerous. The most obvious security lies, not in\r\nmultiplying checks upon the officers, but in reducing the overflowings\r\nof the Treasury to the smallest possible amount. This is President\r\nJackson's last recorded opinion on the subject. It appears worthy to be\r\nkept on record.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nREVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\nThere is less to be said on this head than would be possible in any\r\nother country. When it is known that the United States are troubled with\r\nthe large surplus revenue accruing from the sale of the public lands,\r\nthe whole story is told. The stranger will hear much lamentation in the\r\nSenate about the increase of the public expenses, and will see Hon.\r\nMembers looking as solemn as if the nation were sinking into a gulf of\r\ndebt: but the fear and complaint are, not of the expenditure of money,\r\nbut of the increase of executive patronage.\r\n\r\nThe Customs are the chief source of the revenue of the general\r\ngovernment. They are in course of reduction, year by year. The next\r\ngreat resource is the sale of the public lands. This may be called\r\ninexhaustible; so large is the area yet unoccupied, and so increasing\r\nthe influx of settlers.\r\n\r\nThis happy country is free from the infliction of an excise system; an\r\nexemption which goes far towards making it the most desirable of all\r\nplaces of residence for manufacturers who value practical freedom in the\r\nmanagement of their private concerns, and honesty among their\r\nwork-people. The brewer and glass-manufacturer see the tax-gatherer's\r\nface no oftener than other men. The Post-Office establishment in America\r\nis for the advantage of the people, and not for purposes of taxation;\r\nand every one is satisfied if it pays its own expenses. A small sum is\r\nyielded by patent fees; and also by the mint. Lighthouse-tolls\r\nconstitute another item. But all these united are trifling in comparison\r\nwith the revenue yielded from the two great sources, the Customs and the\r\nPublic Lands.[11]\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the general government are for salaries, pensions,\r\n(three or four hundred pounds,) territorial governments, the mint,\r\nsurveys, and improvements, the census and other public documents, and\r\nthe military and naval establishments.\r\n\r\nThe largest item in the civil list is the payment to Members of\r\nCongress, who receive eight dollars per day, for the session, and their\r\ntravelling expenses. The President's salary is 25,000 dollars. The\r\nVice-president's 5,000. Each of the Secretaries of State, and the\r\nPostmaster-general's, 6,000. The Attorney-general's, 4,000.\r\n\r\nThe seven Judges of the Supreme Court are salaried with the same\r\nmoderation as other members of the federal government. The Chief Justice\r\nhas 5,000 dollars; the six Associate Judges 4,500 each.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioned Officers of the United States army were, in 1835, 674.\r\nNon-commissioned Officers and Privates, 7,547. Total of the United\r\nStates army, 8,221.\r\n\r\nIn the navy, there were, in 1835, 37 Captains, and 40\r\nMasters-commandant. The navy consisted of 12 ships of the line; 14\r\nfirst-class frigates; 3 second-class; 15 sloops of war; 8 schooners and\r\nother small vessels of war.\r\n\r\nThe revenue and expenditure of most of the States are so small as to\r\nmake the annual financial statement resemble the account-books of a\r\nprivate family. The land tax, the proportion of which varies in every\r\nState, is the chief source of revenue. Licenses, fines, and tolls, yield\r\nother sums. In South Carolina, there is a tax on free people of colour!\r\n\r\nThe highest salary that I find paid to the government of a State is\r\n4,000 dollars, (New York and Pennsylvania;) the lowest, 400 dollars,\r\n(Rhode Island.) The other expenses, besides those of government, are for\r\nthe defence of the State, (in Pennsylvania, about forty pounds!) for\r\neducation, (two thousand pounds, in Pennsylvania, the same year,)\r\nprisons, pensions, and state improvements.[12]\r\n\r\nSuch is the financial condition of a people of whom few are individually\r\nvery wealthy or very poor; who all work; and who govern themselves,\r\nappointing one another to manage their common affairs. They have had\r\nevery advantage that nature and circumstances could give them; and\r\nnothing to combat but their own necessary inexperience. As long as the\r\nState expenditure for defence bears the proportion to education of 40l.\r\nto 2,000l., and on to 80,000l., (the amount of the school-tax, now, in\r\nMassachusetts,) all is safe and promising. There is great virtue in\r\nfigures, dull as they are to all but the few who love statistics for the\r\nsake of what they indicate. Those which are cited above disclose a\r\ncondition and a prospect in the presence of which all fears for the\r\npeace and virtue of the States are shamed. Men who govern themselves and\r\neach other with such moderate means, and for such unimpeachable objects,\r\nare no more likely to lapse into disorder than to submit to despotism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The value of the cargoes which arrived at Mobile in 1830, was,\r\n\r\n                                                     Dollars.\r\nBy American vessels                                    69,700\r\n   British                                             74,435\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                                                      144,135\r\n\r\nIn 1834, by American vessels                          314,072\r\n            British                                    74,739\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                                                      388,811\r\n\r\nThe value of the cargoes which departed from Mobile\r\nin 1830, was, by American vessels                   1,517,663\r\n                 British                              476,702\r\n                                                    ---------\r\n                                                    1,994,365\r\n\r\nIn 1834, by American vessels                        4,684,326\r\n            British                                 1,585,871\r\n                                                    ---------\r\n                                                    6,270,197\r\n\r\n[9] \"Log-rolling\" means co-operation for a point which must be carried:\r\non a new settlement in the wilds, by neighbours devoting a day to fell,\r\nroll, and build logs, to make a house before night: in a legislature, by\r\na coterie of members urging on a bill in which they are interested, and\r\ngetting it passed in defiance of inquiry and delay.\r\n\r\n[10] I have before me a collection of specimens of the colonial, and\r\nearly west continental paper currency; such as brought ruin to all who\r\ntrusted it.

One kind of worldly glory passes\r\naway, and another comes. Like a series of clouds sailing by the moon,\r\nand growing dim and dimmer as they go down the sky, are the transitory\r\nglories which are only brightened for an age by man's smile: dark\r\nvapours, which carry no light within themselves. How many such have\r\nfloated across the expanse of history, and melted away! It was once a\r\nglory to have a power of life and death over a patriarchal family: and\r\nhow mean does this now appear, in comparison with the power of life and\r\ndeath which every man has over his own intellect! It was once a glory\r\nto be feared: how much better is it now esteemed to be loved! It was\r\nonce a glory to lay down life to escape from one's personal woes: how\r\nfar higher is it now seen to be to accept those woes as a boon, and to\r\nlay down life only for truth;--for God and not for self! The heroes of\r\nmankind were once its kings and warriors: we look again now, and find\r\nits truest heroes its martyrs, its poets, its artisans; men not buried\r\nunder pyramids or in cathedrals, but whose sepulchre no man knoweth unto\r\nthis day. To them the Lord showed the land of promise, and then buried\r\nthem on the confines. There are two aspects under which every individual\r\nman may be regarded: as a solitary being, with inherent powers, and an\r\nomnipotent will; a creator, a king, an inscrutable mystery: and again,\r\nas a being infinitely connected with all other beings, with none but\r\nderived powers, with a heavenly-directed will; a creature, a subject, a\r\ntransparent medium through which the workings of principles are to be\r\neternally revealed. Both these aspects are true, and therefore\r\nreconcilable. The Old World dwelt almost exclusively on the first and\r\nmeaner aspect: as men rise to inhabit the new heavens and the new earth,\r\nthey will more and more contemplate the other and sublimer. The old\r\nglory of a self-originating power and will is passing away: and it is\r\nbecoming more and more plain that a man's highest honour lies in\r\nbecoming as clear a medium as possible for the revelations which are to\r\nbe made through him: in wiping out every stain, in correcting every flaw\r\nby which the light that is in him may be made dimness or deception. It\r\nwas once a glory to defy or evade the laws of man's physical and moral\r\nbeing; and, in so doing, to encroach upon the rights of others: it is\r\nnow beginning to be shown that there is a higher honour in recognising\r\nand obeying the laws of outward and inward life, and in reverencing\r\ninstead of appropriating the privileges of other wards of Providence.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it was once a glory to be idle, and a shame to work,--at\r\nleast with any member or organ but one,--the brain. Yet it is a law of\r\nevery man's physical nature that he should work with the limbs: of every\r\nman's moral nature, that he should know: and knowledge is to be had only\r\nby one method; by bringing the ideal and the actual world into contact,\r\nand proving each by the other, with one's own brain and hands for\r\ninstruments, and not another's. There is no actual knowledge even of\r\none's own life, to be had in any other way. Yet this is the way which\r\nmen have perversely refused to acknowledge, while every one is more or\r\nless compelled to practise it. Those who have been able to get through\r\nlife with the least possible work have been treated as the happiest:\r\nthose who have had the largest share imposed upon them have been\r\npassively pitied as the most miserable. If the experience of the two\r\ncould have been visibly or tangibly brought into comparison, the false\r\nestimate would have been long ago banished for ever from human\r\ncalculations. If princes and nobles, who have not worked either in war\r\nor in council, men sunk in satiety; if women, shut out of the world of\r\nreality, and compelled by usage to endure the corrosion of unoccupied\r\nthought, and the decay of unemployed powers, were able to speak fully\r\nand truly as they sink into their unearned graves, it would be found\r\nthat their lives had been one hollow misery, redeemed solely by that\r\ndegree of action that had been permitted to them, in order that they\r\nmight, in any wise, live. If the half-starved artisan, if the negro\r\nslave, could, when lying down at length to rest, see and exhibit the\r\nfull vision of their own lives, they would complain far less of too much\r\nwork than of too little freedom, too little knowledge, too many wounds\r\nthrough their affections to their children, their brethren, their race.\r\nThey would complain that their work had been of too exclusive a kind;\r\ntoo much in the actual, while it had been attempted to close the ideal\r\nfrom them. Nor are their cases alike. The artisan works too much in one\r\nway, while too little in another. The negro slave suffers too much by\r\ninfliction, and yet more by privation; but he rarely or never works too\r\nmuch, even with the limbs. He knows the evil of toil, the reluctance,\r\nthe lassitude; but with it he knows also the evil of idleness; the\r\nvacuity, the hopelessness. He has neither the privilege of the brute, to\r\nexercise himself vigorously upon instinct, for an immediate object, to\r\nbe gained and forgotten; nor the privilege of the man, to toil, by moral\r\nnecessity, with some pain, for results which yield an evergrowing\r\npleasure. It is not work which is the curse of the slave: he is rarely\r\nso blessed as to know what it is.\r\n\r\nIf, again, the happiest man who has ever lived on earth, (excepting the\r\nMan of Sorrows, whose depth of peace no one will attempt to fathom,)\r\ncould, in passing into the busier life to come, (to which the present is\r\nonly the nursery mimicking of human affairs,) communicate to us what has\r\nbeen the true blessedness of his brief passage, it would be found to lie\r\nin what he had been enabled to do: not so much blessed in regard to\r\nothers as to himself; not so much because he had made inventions, (even\r\nsuch a one as printing:) not so much because through him countries will\r\nbe better governed, men better educated, and some light from the upper\r\nworld let down into the lower; (for great things as these are, they are\r\nsure to be done, if not by him, by another;) but because his actual\r\ndoing, his joint head and hand-work have revealed to him the truth which\r\nlies about him; and so far, and by the only appointed method, invested\r\nhim with heaven while he was upon earth. Such a one might not be\r\nconscious of this as the chief blessedness of his life, (as men are ever\r\nleast conscious of what is highest and best in themselves:) he might put\r\nit in another form, saying that mankind were growing wiser and happier,\r\nor that goodness and mercy had followed him all the days of his life, or\r\nthat he had found that all evil is only an aspect of ultimate good: in\r\nsome such words of faith or hope he would communicate his inward peace:\r\nbut the real meaning of the true workman, if spoken for him by a divine\r\nvoice, (as spoken by the divine voice of his life,) is, as has been\r\nsaid, that his complete toil has enriched him with truth which can be no\r\notherwise obtained, and which neither the world, nor any one in it,\r\nexcept himself, could give, nor any power in heaven or earth could take\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMankind becomes more clear-sighted to this fact about honour and\r\nblessedness, as time unfolds the sequence of his hieroglyphic scroll;\r\nand a transition in the morals and manners of nations is an inevitable\r\nconsequence, slow as men are in deciphering the picture-writing of the\r\nold teacher; unapt as men are in connecting picture with picture, so as\r\nto draw thence a truth, and in the truth, a prophecy. We must look to\r\nnew or renovated communities to see how much has been really learned.\r\n\r\nThe savage chief, who has never heard the saying \"he that would be chief\r\namong you, let him be your servant,\" feels himself covered with glory\r\nwhen he paces along in his saddle, gorgeous with wampum and feathers,\r\nwhile his squaw follows in the dust, bending under the weight of his\r\nshelter, his food, and his children. Wise men look upon him with all\r\npity and no envy. Higher and higher in society, the right of the\r\nstrongest is supposed to involve honour: and physical is placed above\r\nmoral strength. The work of the limbs, wholly repulsive when separated\r\nfrom that of the head, is devolved upon the weaker, who cannot resist;\r\nand hence arises the disgrace of work, and the honour of being able to\r\nkeep soul and body together, more or less luxuriously, without it. The\r\nbarbaric conqueror makes his captives work for him. His descendants, who\r\nhave no prisoners of war to make slaves of, carry off captives of a\r\nhelpless nation, inferior even to themselves in civilisation. The\r\nservile class rises, by almost imperceptible degrees, as the dawn of\r\nreason brightens towards day. The classes by whom the hand-work of\r\nsociety is done, arrive at being cared for by those who do the\r\nhead-work, or no work at all: then they are legislated for, but still as\r\na common or inferior class, favoured, out of pure bounty, with laws, as\r\nwith soup, which are pronounced \"excellent for the poor:\" then they\r\nbegin to open their minds upon legislation for themselves; and a certain\r\nlip-honour is paid them, which would be rejected as insult if offered to\r\nthose who nevertheless think themselves highly meritorious in\r\nvouchsafing it.\r\n\r\nThis is the critical period out of which must arise a new organisation\r\nof society. When it comes to this, a new promise blossoms under the feet\r\nof the lovers of truth. There are many of the hand-workers now who are\r\non the very borders of the domain of head-work: and, as the\r\nencroachments of those who work not at all have, by this time, become\r\nseriously injurious to the rights of others, there are many thinkers and\r\npersons of learning who are driven over the line, and become\r\nhand-workers; for which they, as they usually afterwards declare, can\r\nnever be sufficiently thankful. There is no drowning the epithalamium\r\nwith which these two classes celebrate the union of thought and\r\nhandicraft. Multitudes press in, or are carried in to the marriage\r\nfeast, and a new era of society has begun. The temporary glory of ease\r\nand disgrace of labour pass away like mountain mists, and the clear\r\nsublimity of toil grows upon men's sight.\r\n\r\nIf, in such an era, a new nation begins its career, what should be\r\nexpected from it?\r\n\r\nIf the organisation of its society were a matter of will; if it had a\r\ndisposable moral force, applicable to controllable circumstances, it is\r\nprobable that the new nation would take after all old nations, and not\r\ndare to make, perhaps not dream of making, the explicit avowal, that\r\nthat which had ever hitherto been a disgrace, except in the eyes of a\r\nvery few prophets, had now come out to be a clear honour. This would be\r\nmore, perhaps, than even a company of ten or fifteen millions of men and\r\nwomen would venture to declare, while such words as Quixotic,\r\nRevolutionary, Utopian, remain on the tongues which wag the most\r\nindustriously in the old world. But, it so happens it is never in the\r\npower of a whole nation to meet in convention, and agree what their\r\nmoral condition shall be. They may agree upon laws for the furtherance\r\nof what is settled to be honourable, and for the exclusion of some of\r\nthe law-bred disgraces of the old world: but it is not in their power to\r\ndispense at will the subtle radiance of moral glory, any more than to\r\ndye their scenery with rainbow hues because they have got hold of a\r\nprism. Moral persuasions grow out of preceding circumstances, as\r\ninstitutions do; and conviction is not communicable where the evidence\r\nis not of a communicable kind. The advantage of the new nation over the\r\nold will be no more than that its individual members are more open to\r\nconviction, from being more accessible to evidence, less burdened with\r\nantique forms and institutions, and partial privileges, so called. The\r\nresult will probably be that some members of the new society will follow\r\nthe ancient fashion of considering work a humiliation; while, upon the\r\nwhole, labour will be more honoured than it has ever been before.\r\n\r\nAmerica is in the singular position of being nearly equally divided\r\nbetween a low degree of the ancient barbarism in relation to labour, and\r\na high degree of the modern enlightenment. Wherever there is a servile\r\nclass, work is considered a disgrace, unless it bears some other name,\r\nand is of an exclusive character. In the free States, labour is more\r\nreally and heartily honoured than, perhaps, in any other part of the\r\ncivilised world. The most extraordinary, and least pleasant circumstance\r\nin the case is that, while the south ridicules and despises the north\r\nfor what is its very highest honour, the north feels somewhat uneasy and\r\nsore under the contempt. It is true that it is from necessity that every\r\nman there works; but, whatever be the cause, the fact is a noble one,\r\nworthy of all rejoicing: and it were to be wished that the north could\r\nreadily and serenely, at all times, and in disregard of all jibes, admit\r\nthe fact, as matter for thankfulness, that there every man works for his\r\nbread with his own head and hands.\r\n\r\nHow do the two parties in reality spend their days?\r\n\r\nIn the north, the children all go to school, and work there, more or\r\nless. As they grow up, they part off into the greatest variety of\r\nemployments. The youths must, without exception, work hard; or they had\r\nbetter drown themselves. Whether they are to be lawyers, or otherwise\r\nprofessional; or merchants, manufacturers, farmers, or citizens, they\r\nhave everything to do for themselves. A very large proportion of them\r\nhave, while learning their future business, to earn the means of\r\nlearning. There is much manual labour in the country colleges; much\r\nteaching in the vacations done by students. Many a great man in Congress\r\nwas seen in his boyhood leading his father's horses to water; and, in\r\nhis youth, guiding the plough in his father's field. There is probably\r\nhardly a man in New England who cannot ride, drive, and tend his own\r\nhorse; scarcely a clergyman, lawyer, or physician, who, if deprived of\r\nhis profession, could not support himself by manual labour. Nor, on the\r\nother hand, is there any farmer or citizen who is not, more or less, a\r\nstudent and thinker. Not only are all capable of discharging their\r\npolitical duty of self-government; but all have somewhat idealised their\r\nlife. All have looked abroad, at least so far as to understand the\r\nforeign relations of their own country: most, I believe, have gone\r\nfurther, and can contemplate the foreign relations of their own being.\r\nSome one great mind, at least, has almost every individual entered into\r\nsympathy with; some divine, or politician, or poet, who has carried the\r\nspirit out beyond the circle of home, State, and country, into the ideal\r\nworld. It is even possible to trace, in the conversation of some who\r\nhave the least leisure for reading, the influence of some one of the\r\nrich sayings, the diamonds and pearls which have dropped from the lips\r\nof genius, to shine in the hearts of all humanity. Some one such saying\r\nmay be perceived to have moulded the thoughts, and shaped the aims, and\r\nbecome the under-current of the whole life of a thinking and labouring\r\nman. Such sayings being hackneyed signifies nothing, while the\r\nindividuals blessed by them do not know it, and hold them in their\r\ninmost hearts, unvexed by hearing them echoed by careless tongues. \"Am\r\nI not a man and a brother?\" \"Happy the man whose wish and care,\" &c.\r\n\"The breaking waves dashed high,\" &c. (Mrs. Hemans's Landing of the\r\nPilgrims,) \"What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue,\"\r\n(Burke)--these are some of the words which, sinking deep into the hearts\r\nof busy men, spring up in a harvest of thoughts and acts.\r\n\r\nThere are a few young men, esteemed the least happy members of the\r\ncommunity, who inherit wealth. The time will come, when the society is\r\nsomewhat older, when it will be understood that wealth need not preclude\r\nwork: but at present, there are no individuals so forlorn, in the\r\nnorthern States, as young men of fortune. Men who have shown energy and\r\nskill in working their way in society are preferred for political\r\nrepresentatives: there is no scientific or literary class, for such\r\nindividuals to fall into: all the world is busy around them, and they\r\nare reduced to the predicament, unhappily the most dreaded of all in the\r\nUnited States, of standing alone. Their method, therefore, is to spend\r\ntheir money as fast as possible, and begin the world like other men. I\r\nam stating this as matter of fact; not as being reasonable and right.\r\n\r\nAs for the women of the northern States, most have the blessing of work,\r\nthough not of the extent and variety which will hereafter be seen to be\r\nnecessary for the happiness of their lives. All married women, except\r\nthe ladies of rich merchants and others, are liable to have their hands\r\nfull of household occupation, from the uncertainty of domestic service;\r\na topic to be referred to hereafter. Women who do not marry have, in\r\nmany instances, to work for their support; and, as will be shown in\r\nanother connexion, under peculiar disadvantages. Work, on the whole,\r\nmay be considered the rule, and vacuity the exception.[13]\r\n\r\nWhat is life in the slave States, in respect of work?\r\n\r\nThere are two classes, the servile and the imperious, between whom there\r\nis a great gulf fixed. The servile class has not even the benefit of\r\nhearty toil. No solemn truths sink down into them, to cheer their\r\nhearts, stimulate their minds, and nerve their hands. Their wretched\r\nlives are passed between an utter debasement of the will, and a conflict\r\nof the will with external force.\r\n\r\nThe other class is in circumstances as unfavourable as the least happy\r\norder of persons in the old world. The means of educating children are\r\nso meagre[14] that young people begin life under great disadvantages.\r\nThe vicious fundamental principle of morals in a slave country, that\r\nlabour is disgraceful, taints the infant mind with a stain which is as\r\nfatal in the world of spirits as the negro tinge is at present in the\r\nworld of society. It made my heart ache to hear the little children\r\nunconsciously uttering thoughts with which no true religion, no true\r\nphilosophy can coexist. \"Do you think _I_ shall work?\" \"O, you must not\r\ntouch the poker here.\" \"You must not do this or that for yourself: the\r\nnegroes will be offended, and it won't do for a lady to do so.\" \"Poor\r\nthing! she has to teach: if she had come here, she might have married a\r\nrich man, perhaps.\" \"Mamma has so much a-year now, so we have not to do\r\nour work at home, or any trouble. 'Tis such a comfort!\"--When children\r\nat school call everything that pleases them \"gentlemanly,\" and pity all\r\n(but slaves) who have to work, and talk of marrying early for an\r\nestablishment, it is all over with them. A more hopeless state of\r\ndegradation can hardly be conceived of, however they may ride, and play\r\nthe harp, and sing Italian, and teach their slaves what they call\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\"Poor things!\" may be said of such, in return. They know little, with\r\ntheir horror of work, of what awaits them. Theirs is destined to be, if\r\ntheir wish of an establishment is fulfilled, a life of toil, irksome and\r\nunhonoured. They escape the name; but they are doomed to undergo the\r\nworst of the reality. Their husbands are not to be envied, though they\r\ndo ride on white horses, (the slave's highest conception of bliss,) lie\r\ndown to repose in hot weather, and spend their hours between the\r\ndischarge of hospitality and the superintendence of their estates; and\r\nthe highly honourable and laborious charge of public affairs. But the\r\nwives of slave-holders are, as they and their husbands declare, as much\r\nslaves as their negroes. If they will not have everything go to rack and\r\nruin around them, they must superintend every household operation, from\r\nthe cellar to the garrets: for there is nothing that slaves can do well.\r\nWhile the slaves are perpetually at one's heels, lolling against the\r\nbed-posts before one rises in the morning, standing behind the chairs,\r\nleaning on the sofa, officiously undertaking, and invariably spoiling\r\neverything that one had rather do for one's-self, the smallest possible\r\namount of real service is performed. The lady of the house carries her\r\nhuge bunch of keys, (for every consumable thing must be locked up,) and\r\nhas to give out, on incessant requests, whatever is wanted for the\r\nhousehold. She is for ever superintending, and trying to keep things\r\nstraight, without the slightest hope of attaining anything like leisure\r\nand comfort. What is there in retinue, in the reputation of ease and\r\nluxury, which can compensate for toils and cares of this nature? How\r\nmuch happier must be the lot of a village milliner, or of the artisan's\r\nwife who sweeps her own floors, and cooks her husband's dinner, than\r\nthat of the planter's lady with twenty slaves to wait upon her; her sons\r\nmigrating because work is out of the question, and they have not the\r\nmeans to buy estates; and her daughters with no better prospect than\r\nmarrying, as she has done, to toil as she does!\r\n\r\nSome few of these ladies are among the strongest-minded and most\r\nremarkable women I have ever known. There are great draw-backs, (as will\r\nbe seen hereafter,) but their mental vigour is occasionally proportioned\r\nto their responsibility. Women who have to rule over a barbarous\r\nsociety, (small though it be,) to make and enforce laws, provide for\r\nall the physical wants, and regulate the entire habits of a number of\r\npersons who can in no respect take care of themselves, must be strong\r\nand strongly disciplined, if they in any degree discharge this duty.\r\nThose who shrink from it become perhaps the weakest women I have\r\nanywhere seen: selfishly timid, humblingly dependent, languid in body,\r\nand with minds of no reach at all. These two extremes are found in the\r\nslave States, in the most striking opposition. It is worthy of note,\r\nthat I never found there a woman strong enough voluntarily to brave the\r\nwoes of life in the presence of slavery; nor any woman weak enough to\r\nextenuate the vices of the system; each knowing, prior to experience,\r\nwhat those woes and vices are.\r\n\r\nThere are a few unhappy persons in the slave States, too few, I believe,\r\nto be called a class, who strongly exemplify the consequences of such a\r\nprinciple of morals as that work is a disgrace. There are a few, called\r\nby the slaves \"mean whites;\" signifying whites who work with the hands.\r\nWhere there is a coloured servile class, whose colour has become a\r\ndisgrace through their servitude, two results are inevitable: that those\r\nwho have the colour without the servitude are disgraced among the\r\nwhites; and those who have the servitude without the colour are as\r\ndeeply disgraced among the coloured. More intensely than white\r\nwork-people are looked down upon at Port-au-Prince, are the \"mean\r\nwhites\" despised by the slaves of the Carolinas. They make the most, of\r\ncourse, of the only opportunity they can ever have of doing what they\r\nsee their superiors do,--despising their fellow-creatures. No inducement\r\nwould be sufficient to bring honest, independent men into the constant\r\npresence of double-distilled hatred and contempt like this; and the\r\ngeneral character of the \"mean whites\" may therefore be anticipated.\r\nThey are usually men who have no prospect, no chance elsewhere; the\r\nlowest of the low.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that no inducement would be sufficient, I mean no politic\r\ninducement. There are inducements of the same force as those which drew\r\nmartyrs of old into the presence of savage beasts in the amphitheatre,\r\nwhich guided Howard through the gloom of prisons, and strengthened Guyon\r\nof Marseilles to offer himself a certain victim to the plague,--there\r\nare inducements of such force as this which carry down families to dwell\r\nin the midst of contempt and danger, where everything is lost but,--the\r\none object which carries them there. \"Mean whites\" these friends of the\r\noppressed fugitive may be in the eyes of all around them; but how they\r\nstand in the eye of One whose thoughts are not as our thoughts, may some\r\nday be revealed. To themselves it is enough that their object is gained.\r\nThey do not want praise; they are above it: and they have shown that\r\nthey can do without sympathy. It is enough to commend them to their own\r\npeace of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nMORALS OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nThis title is not written down in a spirit of mockery; though there\r\nappears to be a mockery somewhere, when we contrast slavery with the\r\nprinciples and the rule which are the test of all American\r\ninstitutions:--the principles that all men are born free and equal;\r\nthat rulers derive their just powers from the consent of the governed;\r\nand the rule of reciprocal justice. This discrepancy between principles\r\nand practice needs no more words. But the institution of slavery exists;\r\nand what we have to see is what the morals are of the society which is\r\nsubject to it.\r\n\r\nWhat social virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is the\r\nprimary characteristic? in a society which is divided into two classes,\r\nthe servile and the imperious?\r\n\r\nThe most obvious is Mercy. Nowhere, perhaps, can more touching exercises\r\nof mercy be seen than here. It must be remembered that the greater\r\nnumber of slave-holders have no other idea than of holding slaves. Their\r\nfathers did it: they themselves have never known the coloured race\r\ntreated otherwise than as inferior beings, born to work for and to teaze\r\nthe whites; helpless, improvident, open to no higher inducements than\r\nindulgence and praise; capable of nothing but entire dependence. The\r\ngood affections of slave-holders like these show themselves in the form\r\nof mercy; which is as beautiful to witness as mercy, made a substitute\r\nfor justice, can ever be. I saw endless manifestations of mercy, as well\r\nas of its opposite. The thoughtfulness of masters, mistresses, and their\r\nchildren about, not only the comforts, but the indulgences of their\r\nslaves, was a frequent subject of admiration with me. Kind masters are\r\nliberal in the expenditure of money, and (what is better) of thought, in\r\ngratifying the whims and fancies of their negroes. They make large\r\nsacrifices occasionally for the social or domestic advantage of their\r\npeople; and use great forbearance in the exercise of the power conferred\r\nupon them by law and custom.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the cholera was ravaging South Carolina, a wealthy\r\nslave-holder there refused to leave the State, as most of his neighbours\r\nwere doing. He would not consent to take any further care of himself\r\nthan riding to a distance from his plantation (then overrun by the\r\ndisease) to sleep. All day he was among his slaves: nursing them with\r\nhis own hands; putting them into the bath, giving them medicine himself,\r\nand cheering their spirits by his presence and his care. He saved them\r\nalmost all. No one will suppose this one of the ordinary cases where a\r\nmaster has his slaves taken care of as property, not as men. Sordid\r\nconsiderations of that kind must have given way before the terrors of\r\nthe plague. A far higher strength than that of self-interest was\r\nnecessary to carry this gentleman through such a work as this; and it\r\nwas no other than mercy.\r\n\r\nAgain:--a young man, full of the southern pride, one of whose aims is to\r\nhave as great a display of negroes as possible, married a young lady\r\nwho, soon after her marriage, showed an imperious and cruel temper\r\ntowards her slaves. Her husband gently remonstrated. She did not mend.\r\nHe warned her, that he would not allow beings, for whose comfort he was\r\nresponsible, to be oppressed; and that, if she compelled him to it, he\r\nwould deprive her of the power she misused. Still she did not mend. He\r\none day came and told her that he had sold all his domestic slaves, for\r\ntheir own sakes. He told her that he would always give her money enough\r\nto hire free service, when it was to be had; and that when it was not,\r\nhe would cheerfully bear, and help her to bear, the domestic\r\ninconveniences which must arise from their having no servants. He kept\r\nhis word. It rarely happens that free service can be hired; and this\r\nproud gentleman assists his wife's labours with his own hands; and\r\n(what is more) endures with all cheerfulness the ignominy of having no\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nNothing struck me more than the patience of slave-owners. In this virtue\r\nthey probably surpass the whole Christian world;--I mean in their\r\npatience with their slaves; for one cannot much praise their patience\r\nwith the abolitionists, or with the tariff; or in some other cases of\r\npolitical vexation. When I considered how they love to be called \"fiery\r\nsoutherners,\" I could not but marvel at their mild forbearance under the\r\nhourly provocations to which they are liable in their homes.[15] It is\r\nfound that such a degree of this virtue can be obtained only by long\r\nhabit. Persons from New England, France, or England, becoming\r\nslave-holders, are found to be the most severe masters and mistresses,\r\nhowever good their tempers may always have appeared previously. They\r\ncannot, like the native proprietor, sit waiting half an hour for the\r\nsecond course, or see everything done in the worst possible manner;\r\ntheir rooms dirty, their property wasted, their plans frustrated, their\r\ninfants slighted, themselves deluded by artifices,--they cannot, like\r\nthe native proprietor, endure all this unruffled. It seems to me that\r\nevery slave-holder's temper is subjected to a discipline which must\r\neither ruin or perfect it. While we know that many tempers are thus\r\nruined, and must mourn for the unhappy creatures who cannot escape from\r\ntheir tyranny, it is evident, on the other hand, that many tempers are\r\nto be met with which should shame down and silence for ever the\r\nirritability of some whose daily life is passed under circumstances of\r\ncomparative ease.\r\n\r\nThis mercy, indulgence, patience, was often pleaded to me in defence of\r\nthe system, or in aggravation of the faults of intractable slaves. The\r\nfallacy of this is so gross as not to need exposure anywhere but on the\r\nspot. I was heart-sick of being told of the ingratitude of slaves, and\r\nweary of explaining that indulgence can never atone for injury: that the\r\nextremest pampering, for a life-time, is no equivalent for rights\r\nwithheld, no reparation for irreparable injustice. What are the greatest\r\npossible amounts of finery, sweetmeats, dances, gratuities, and kind\r\nwords and looks, in exchange for political, social, and domestic\r\nexistence? for body and spirit? Is it not true that the life is more\r\nthan meat, and the body than raiment?\r\n\r\nThis fallacious plea was urged upon me by three different persons,\r\nesteemed enlightened and religious, in relation to one case. The case\r\nwas this. A lady of fortune carried into her husband's establishment,\r\nwhen she married, several slaves, and among them a girl two years\r\nyounger than herself, who had been brought up under her, and who was\r\nemployed as her own maid. The little slaves are accustomed to play\r\nfreely with the children of the family--a practice which was lauded to\r\nme, but which never had any beauty in my eyes, seeing, as I did, the\r\ninjury to the white children from unrestricted intercourse with the\r\ndegraded race, and looking forward as I did to the time when they must\r\nseparate into the servile and imperious. Mrs. ---- had been unusually\r\nindulgent to this girl, having allowed her time and opportunity for\r\nreligious and other instruction, and favoured her in every way. One\r\nnight, when the girl was undressing her, the lady expressed her fondness\r\nfor her, and said, among other things: \"When I die you shall be\r\nfree;\"--a dangerous thing to say to a slave only two years younger than\r\nherself. In a short time the lady was taken ill,--with a strange,\r\nmysterious illness, which no doctor could alleviate. One of her friends,\r\nwho suspected foul play, took the sufferer entirely under her own\r\ncharge, when she seemed to be dying. She revived; and as soon as she was\r\nwell enough to have a will of her own again, would be waited on by no\r\none but her favourite slave. She grew worse. She alternated thus, for\r\nsome time, according as she was under the care of this slave or of her\r\nfriend. At last, the friend excluded from her chamber every one but the\r\nphysicians: took in the medicines at the room door from the hands of the\r\nslave, and locked them up. They were all analysed by a physician, and\r\narsenic found in every one of them. The lady partially recovered; but I\r\nwas shocked at the traces of suffering in her whole appearance. The\r\ngirl's guilt was brought clearly home to her. There never was a case of\r\nmore cruel, deliberate intention to murder. If ever slave deserved the\r\ngallows, (which ought to be questionable to the most decided minds,)\r\nthis girl did. What was done? The lady was tenderhearted, and could not\r\nbear to have her hanged. This was natural enough; but what did she\r\ntherefore do? keep her under her own eye, that she might at least poison\r\nnobody else, and perhaps be touched and reclaimed by the clemency of the\r\nperson she would have murdered? No. The lady sold her.\r\n\r\nI was actually called upon to admire the lady's conduct; and was asked\r\nwhether the ingratitude of the girl was not inconceivable, and her\r\nhypocrisy too; for she used to lecture her mistress and her mistress's\r\nfriends for being so irreligious as to go to parties on Saturday nights,\r\nwhen they should have been preparing their minds for Sunday. Was not the\r\nhypocrisy of the girl inconceivable? and her ingratitude for her\r\nmistress's favours? No. The girl had no other idea of religion,--could\r\nhave no other than that it consists in observances, and, wicked as she\r\nwas, her wickedness could not be called ingratitude, for she was more\r\ninjured than favoured, after all. All indulgences that could be heaped\r\nupon her were still less than her due, and her mistress remained\r\ninfinitely her debtor.\r\n\r\nLittle can be said of the purity of manners of the whites of the south;\r\nbut there is purity. Some few examples of domestic fidelity may be\r\nfound: few enough, by the confession of residents on the spot; but those\r\nindividuals who have resisted the contagion of the vice amidst which\r\nthey dwell are pure. Every man who resides on his plantation may have\r\nhis harem, and has every inducement of custom, and of pecuniary\r\ngain,[16] to tempt him to the common practice. Those who,\r\nnotwithstanding, keep their homes undefiled may be considered as of\r\nincorruptible purity.\r\n\r\nHere, alas! ends my catalogue of the virtues which are of possible\r\nexercise by slave-holders towards their labourers. The inherent\r\ninjustice of the system extinguishes all others, and nourishes a whole\r\nharvest of false morals towards the rest of society.\r\n\r\nThe personal oppression of the negroes is the grossest vice which\r\nstrikes a stranger in the country. It can never be otherwise when human\r\nbeings are wholly subjected to the will of other human beings, who are\r\nunder no other external control than the law which forbids killing and\r\nmaiming;--a law which it is difficult to enforce in individual cases. A\r\nfine slave was walking about in Columbia, South Carolina, when I was\r\nthere, nearly helpless and useless from the following causes. His master\r\nwas fond of him, and the slave enjoyed the rare distinction of never\r\nhaving been flogged. One day, his master's child, supposed to be under\r\nhis care at the time, fell down and hurt itself. The master flew into a\r\npassion, ordered the slave to be instantly flogged, and would not hear a\r\nsingle word the man had to say. As soon as the flogging was over, the\r\nslave went into the back yard, where there was an axe and a block, and\r\nstruck off the upper half of his right hand. He went and held up the\r\nbleeding hand before his master, saying, \"You have mortified me, so I\r\nhave made myself useless. Now you must maintain me as long as I live.\"\r\nIt came out that the child had been under the charge of another person.\r\n\r\nThere are, as is well known throughout the country, houses in the free\r\nStates which are open to fugitive slaves, and where they are concealed\r\ntill the search for them is over. I know some of the secrets of such\r\nplaces; and can mention two cases, among many, of runaways, which show\r\nhow horrible is the tyranny which the slave system authorises men to\r\ninflict on each other. A negro had found his way to one of these\r\nfriendly houses; and had been so skilfully concealed, that repeated\r\nsearches by his master, (who had followed for the purpose of recovering\r\nhim,) and by constables, had been in vain. After three weeks of this\r\nseclusion, the negro became weary, and entreated of his host to be\r\npermitted to look out of the window. His host strongly advised him to\r\nkeep quiet, as it was pretty certain that his master had not given him\r\nup. When the host had left him, however, the negro came out of his\r\nhiding-place, and went to the window. He met the eye of his master, who\r\nwas looking up from the street. The poor slave was obliged to return to\r\nhis bondage.\r\n\r\nA young negress had escaped in like manner; was in like manner\r\nconcealed; and was alarmed by constables, under the direction of her\r\nmaster, entering the house in pursuit of her, when she had had reason to\r\nbelieve that the search was over. She flew up stairs to her chamber in\r\nthe third story, and drove a heavy article of furniture against the\r\ndoor. The constables pushed in, notwithstanding, and the girl leaped\r\nfrom the window into the paved street. Her master looked at her as she\r\nlay, declared she would never be good for anything again, and went back\r\ninto the south. The poor creature, her body bruised, and her limbs\r\nfractured, was taken up, and kindly nursed; and she is now maintained in\r\nBoston, in her maimed condition, by the charity of some ladies there.\r\n\r\nThe following story has found its way into the northern States (as few\r\nsuch stories do) from the circumstance that a New Hampshire family are\r\nconcerned in it. It has excited due horror wherever it is known; and it\r\nis to be hoped that it will lead to the exposure of more facts of the\r\nsame kind, since it is but too certain that they are common.\r\n\r\nA New Hampshire gentleman went down into Louisiana, many years ago, to\r\ntake a plantation. He pursued the usual method; borrowing money largely\r\nto begin with, paying high interest, and clearing off his debt, year by\r\nyear, as his crops were sold. He followed another custom there; taking a\r\nQuadroon wife: a mistress, in the eye of the law, since there can be no\r\nlegal marriage between whites and persons of any degree of colour: but,\r\nin nature and in reason, the woman he took home was his wife. She was a\r\nwell-principled, amiable, well-educated woman; and they lived happily\r\ntogether for twenty years. She had only the slightest possible tinge of\r\ncolour. Knowing the law that the children of slaves are to follow the\r\nfortunes of the mother, she warned her husband that she was not free, an\r\nancestress having been a slave, and the legal act of manumission having\r\nnever been performed. The husband promised to look to it: but neglected\r\nit. At the end of twenty years, one died, and the other shortly\r\nfollowed, leaving daughters; whether two or three, I have not been able\r\nto ascertain with positive certainty; but I have reason to believe\r\nthree, of the ages of fifteen, seventeen, and eighteen: beautiful girls,\r\nwith no perceptible mulatto tinge. The brother of their father came down\r\nfrom New Hampshire to settle the affairs; and he supposed, as every one\r\nelse did, that the deceased had been wealthy. He was pleased with his\r\nnieces, and promised to carry them back with him into New Hampshire, and\r\n(as they were to all appearance perfectly white) to introduce them into\r\nthe society which by education they were fitted for. It appeared,\r\nhowever, that their father had died insolvent. The deficiency was very\r\nsmall: but it was necessary to make an inventory of the effects, to\r\ndeliver to the creditors. This was done by the brother,--the executor.\r\nSome of the creditors called on him, and complained that he had not\r\ndelivered in a faithful inventory. He declared he had. No: the number of\r\nslaves was not accurately set down: he had omitted the daughters. The\r\nexecutor was overwhelmed with horror, and asked time for thought. He\r\nwent round among the creditors, appealing to their mercy: but they\r\nanswered that these young ladies were \"a first-rate article,\" too\r\nvaluable to be relinquished. He next offered, (though he had himself\r\nsix children, and very little money,) all he had for the redemption of\r\nhis nieces; alleging that it was more than they would bring in the\r\nmarket for house or field labour. This was refused with scorn. It was\r\nsaid that there were other purposes for which the girls would bring more\r\nthan for field or house labour. The uncle was in despair, and felt\r\nstrongly tempted to wish their death rather than their surrender to such\r\na fate as was before them. He told them, abruptly, what was their\r\nprospect. He declares that he never before beheld human grief; never\r\nbefore heard the voice of anguish. They never ate, nor slept, nor\r\nseparated from each other, till the day when they were taken into the\r\nNew Orleans slave-market. There they were sold, separately, at high\r\nprices, for the vilest of purposes: and where each is gone, no one\r\nknows. They are, for the present, lost. But they will arise to the light\r\nin the day of retribution.\r\n\r\nIt is a common boast in the south that there is less vice in their\r\ncities than in those of the north. This can never, as a matter of fact,\r\nhave been ascertained; as the proceedings of slave households are, or\r\nmay be, a secret: and in the north, what licentiousness there is may be\r\ndetected. But such comparisons are bad. Let any one look at the positive\r\nlicentiousness of the south, and declare if, in such a state of society,\r\nthere can be any security for domestic purity and peace. The Quadroon\r\nconnexions in New Orleans are all but universal, as I was assured on the\r\nspot by ladies who cannot be mistaken. The history of such connexions is\r\na melancholy one: but it ought to be made known while there are any who\r\nboast of the superior morals of New Orleans, on account of the decent\r\nquietness of the streets and theatres.\r\n\r\nThe Quadroon girls of New Orleans are brought up by their mothers to be\r\nwhat they have been; the mistresses of white gentlemen. The boys are\r\nsome of them sent to France; some placed on land in the back of the\r\nState; and some are sold in the slave-market. They marry women of a\r\nsomewhat darker colour than their own; the women of their own colour\r\nobjecting to them, \"ils sont si dégoutants!\" The girls are highly\r\neducated, externally, and are, probably, as beautiful and accomplished a\r\nset of women as can be found. Every young man early selects one, and\r\nestablishes her in one of those pretty and peculiar houses, whole rows\r\nof which may be seen in the Remparts. The connexion now and then lasts\r\nfor life: usually for several years. In the latter case, when the time\r\ncomes for the gentleman to take a white wife, the dreadful news reaches\r\nhis Quadroon partner, either by a letter entitling her to call the house\r\nand furniture her own, or by the newspaper which announces his marriage.\r\nThe Quadroon ladies are rarely or never known to form a second\r\nconnexion. Many commit suicide: more die brokenhearted. Some men\r\ncontinue the connexion after marriage. Every Quadroon woman believes\r\nthat her partner will prove an exception to the rule of desertion. Every\r\nwhite lady believes that her husband has been an exception to the rule\r\nof seduction.\r\n\r\nWhat security for domestic purity and peace there can be where every man\r\nhas had two connexions, one of which must be concealed; and two\r\nfamilies, whose existence must not be known to each other; where the\r\nconjugal relation begins in treachery, and must be carried on with a\r\nheavy secret in the husband's breast, no words are needed to explain. If\r\nthis is the system which is boasted of as a purer than ordinary state of\r\nmorals, what is to be thought of the ordinary state? It can only be\r\nhoped that the boast is an empty one.\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion to explain the management of the female slaves on\r\nestates where the object is to rear as many as possible, like stock, for\r\nthe southern market: nor to point out the boundless licentiousness\r\ncaused by the practice: a practice which wrung from the wife of a\r\nplanter, in the bitterness of her heart, the declaration that a\r\nplanter's wife was only \"the chief slave of the harem.\" Mr. Madison\r\navowed that the licentiousness of Virginian plantations stopped just\r\nshort of destruction; and that it was understood that the female slaves\r\nwere to become mothers at fifteen.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of the highest character, a southern planter, observed, in\r\nconversation with a friend, that little was known, out of bounds, of the\r\nreasons of the new laws by which emancipation was made so difficult as\r\nit is. He said that the very general connexion of white gentlemen with\r\ntheir female slaves introduced a mulatto race whose numbers would become\r\ndangerous, if the affections of their white parents were permitted to\r\nrender them free. The liberty of emancipating them was therefore\r\nabolished, while that of selling them remained. There are persons who\r\nweakly trust to the force of the parental affection for putting an end\r\nto slavery, when the amalgamation of the races shall have gone so far as\r\nto involve a sufficient number! I actually heard this from the lips of a\r\nclergyman in the south. Yet these planters, who sell their own offspring\r\nto fill their purses, who have such offspring for the sake of filling\r\ntheir purses, dare to raise the cry of \"amalgamation\" against the\r\nabolitionists of the north, not one of whom has, as far as evidence can\r\nshow, conceived the idea of a mixture of the races. It is from the\r\nsouth, where this mixture is hourly encouraged, that the canting and\r\ngroundless reproach has come. I met with no candid southerner who was\r\nnot full of shame at the monstrous hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the most savage violences that are now heard of\r\nin the world take place in the southern and western States of America.\r\nBurning alive, cutting the heart out, and sticking it on the point of a\r\nknife, and other such diabolical deeds, the result of the deepest hatred\r\nof which the human heart is capable, are heard of only there. The\r\nfrequency of such deeds is a matter of dispute, which time will\r\nsettle.[17] The existence of such deeds is a matter of no dispute.\r\nWhether two or twenty such deeds take place in a year, their\r\nperpetration testifies to the existence of such hatred as alone could\r\nprompt them. There is no doubt in my mind as to the immediate causes of\r\nsuch outrages. They arise out of the licentiousness of manners. The\r\nnegro is exasperated by being deprived of his wife,--by being sent out\r\nof the way that his master may take possession of his home. He stabs his\r\nmaster; or, if he cannot fulfil his desire of vengeance, he is a\r\ndangerous person, an object of vengeance in return, and destined to some\r\ncruel fate. If the negro attempts to retaliate, and defile the master's\r\nhome, the faggots are set alight about him. Much that is dreadful ensues\r\nfrom the negro being subject to toil and the lash: but I am confident\r\nthat the licentiousness of the masters is the proximate cause of society\r\nin the south and south-west being in such a state that nothing else is\r\nto be looked for than its being dissolved into its elements, if man does\r\nnot soon cease to be called the property of man. This dissolution will\r\nnever take place through the insurrection of the negroes; but by the\r\nnatural operation of vice. But the process of demoralisation will be\r\nstopped, I have no doubt, before it reaches that point. There is no\r\nreason to apprehend serious insurrection; for the negroes are too\r\ndegraded to act in concert, or to stand firm before the terrible face of\r\nthe white man. Like all deeply-injured classes of persons, they are\r\ndesperate and cruel, on occasion, kindly as their nature is; but as a\r\nclass, they have no courage. The voice of a white, even of a lady, if it\r\nwere authoritative, would make a whole regiment of rebellious slaves\r\nthrow down their arms and flee. Poison is the weapon that suits them\r\nbest: then the knife, in moments of exasperation. They will never take\r\nthe field, unless led on by free blacks. Desperate as the state of\r\nsociety is, it will be rectified, probably, without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that it is doing an injustice to cite extreme cases of\r\nvice as indications of the state of society. I do not think so, as long\r\nas such cases are so common as to strike the observation of a mere\r\npassing stranger; to say nothing of their incompatibility with a decent\r\nand orderly fulfilment of the social relations. Let us, however, see\r\nwhat is the very best state of things. Let us take the words and deeds\r\nof some of the most religious, refined, and amiable members of society.\r\nIt was this aspect of affairs which grieved me more, if possible, than\r\nthe stormier one which I have presented. The coarsening and hardening of\r\nmind and manners among the best; the blunting of the moral sense among\r\nthe most conscientious, gave me more pain than the stabbing, poisoning,\r\nand burning. A few examples which will need no comment, will suffice.\r\n\r\nTwo ladies, the distinguishing ornaments of a very superior society in\r\nthe south, are truly unhappy about slavery, and opened their hearts\r\nfreely to me upon the grief which it caused them,--the perfect curse\r\nwhich they found it. They need no enlightening on this, nor any stimulus\r\nto acquit themselves as well as their unhappy circumstances allow. They\r\none day pressed me for a declaration of what I should do in their\r\nsituation. I replied that I would give up everything, go away with my\r\nslaves, settle them, and stay by them in some free place. I had said,\r\namong other things, that I dare not stay there,--on my own\r\naccount,--from moral considerations. \"What, not if you had no slaves?\"\r\n\"No.\" \"Why?\" \"I could not trust myself to live where I must constantly\r\nwitness the exercise of irresponsible power.\" They made no reply at the\r\nmoment: but each found occasion to tell me, some days afterwards, that\r\nshe had been struck to the heart by these words: the consideration I\r\nmentioned having never occurred to her before!\r\n\r\nMadame Lalaurie, the person who was mobbed at New Orleans, on account of\r\nher fiendish cruelty to her slaves,--a cruelty so excessive as to compel\r\nthe belief that she was mentally deranged, though her derangement could\r\nhave taken such a direction nowhere but in a slave country;--this person\r\nwas described to me as having been \"very pleasant to whites.\"\r\n\r\nA common question put to me by amiable ladies was, \"Do not you find the\r\nslaves generally very happy?\" They never seemed to have been asked, or\r\nto have asked themselves, the question with which I replied:--\"Would you\r\nbe happy with their means?\"\r\n\r\nOne sultry morning, I was sitting with a friend, who was giving me all\r\nmanner of information about her husband's slaves, both in the field and\r\nhouse; how she fed and clothed them; what indulgences they were allowed;\r\nwhat their respective capabilities were; and so forth. While we were\r\ntalking, one of the house-slaves passed us. I observed that she appeared\r\nsuperior to all the rest; to which my friend assented. \"She is A.'s\r\nwife?\" said I. \"We call her A.'s wife, but she has never been married\r\nto him. A. and she came to my husband, five years ago, and asked him to\r\nlet them marry: but he could not allow it, because he had not made up\r\nhis mind whether to sell A.; and he hates parting husband and wife.\"\r\n\"How many children have they?\" \"Four.\" \"And they are not married yet?\"\r\n\"No; my husband has never been able to let them marry. He certainly will\r\nnot sell her: and he has not determined yet whether he shall sell A.\"\r\n\r\nAnother friend told me the following story. B. was the best slave in her\r\nhusband's possession. B. fell in love with C., a pretty girl, on a\r\nneighbouring estate, who was purchased to be B.'s wife. C.'s temper was\r\njealous and violent; and she was always fancying that B. showed\r\nattention to other girls. Her master warned her to keep her temper, or\r\nshe should be sent away. One day, when the master was dining out, B.\r\ncame to him, trembling, and related that C. had, in a fit of jealousy,\r\naimed a blow at his head with an axe, and nearly struck him. The master\r\nwent home, and told C. that her temper could no longer be borne with,\r\nand she must go. He offered her the choice of being sold to a trader,\r\nand carried to New Orleans, or of being sent to field labour on a\r\ndistant plantation. She preferred being sold to the trader; who broke\r\nhis promise of taking her to New Orleans, and disposed of her to a\r\nneighbouring proprietor. C. kept watch over her husband, declaring that\r\nshe would be the death of any girl whom B. might take to wife. \"And so,\"\r\nsaid my informant, \"poor B. was obliged to walk about in single\r\nblessedness for some time; till, last summer, happily, C. died.\"--\"Is it\r\npossible,\" said I, \"that you pair and part these people like\r\nbrutes?\"--The lady looked surprised, and asked what else could be done.\r\n\r\nOne day at dinner, when two slaves were standing behind our chairs, the\r\nlady of the house was telling me a ludicrous story, in which a former\r\nslave of hers was one of the personages, serving as a butt on the\r\nquestion of complexion. She seemed to recollect that slaves were\r\nlistening; for she put in, \"D. was an excellent boy,\" (the term for male\r\nslaves of every age.) \"We respected him very highly as an excellent boy.\r\nWe respected him almost as much as if he had been a white. But, &c.----\"\r\n\r\nA southern lady, of fair reputation for refinement and cultivation, told\r\nthe following story in the hearing of a company, among whom were some\r\nfriends of mine. She spoke with obvious unconsciousness that she was\r\nsaying anything remarkable: indeed such unconsciousness was proved by\r\nher telling the story at all. She had possessed a very pretty mulatto\r\ngirl, of whom she declared herself fond. A young man came to stay at her\r\nhouse, and fell in love with the girl. \"She came to me,\" said the lady,\r\n\"for protection; which I gave her.\" The young man went away, but after\r\nsome weeks, returned, saying he was so much in love with the girl that\r\nhe could not live without her. \"I pitied the young man,\" concluded the\r\nlady; \"so I sold the girl to him for 1,500 dollars.\"\r\n\r\nI repeatedly heard the preaching of a remarkably liberal man, of a free\r\nand kindly spirit, in the south. His last sermon, extempore, was from\r\nthe text \"Cast all your care upon him, for He careth for you.\" The\r\npreacher told us, among other things, that God cares for all,--for the\r\nmeanest as well as the mightiest. \"He cares for that coloured person,\"\r\nsaid he, pointing to the gallery where the people of colour sit,--\"he\r\ncares for that coloured person as well as for the wisest and best of you\r\nwhites.\" This was the most wanton insult I had ever seen offered to a\r\nhuman being; and it was with difficulty that I refrained from walking\r\nout of the church. Yet no one present to whom I afterwards spoke of it\r\nseemed able to comprehend the wrong. \"Well!\" said they: \"does not God\r\ncare for the coloured people?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, in a society where things like these are said and done by its\r\nchoicest members, there is a prevalent unconsciousness of the existing\r\nwrong. The daily and hourly plea is of good intentions towards the\r\nslaves; of innocence under the aspersions of foreigners. They are as\r\nsincere in the belief that they are injured as their visitors are\r\ncordial in their detestation of the morals of slavery. Such\r\nunconsciousness of the milder degrees of impurity and injustice as\r\nenables ladies and clergymen of the highest character to speak and act\r\nas I have related, is a sufficient evidence of the prevalent grossness\r\nof morals. One remarkable indication of such blindness was the almost\r\nuniversal mention of the state of the Irish to me, as a worse case than\r\nAmerican slavery. I never attempted, of course, to vindicate the state\r\nof Ireland: but I was surprised to find no one able, till put in the\r\nway, to see the distinction between political misgovernment and personal\r\nslavery: between exasperating a people by political insult, and\r\npossessing them, like brutes, for pecuniary profit. The unconsciousness\r\nof guilt is the worst of symptoms, where there are means of light to be\r\nhad. I shall have to speak hereafter of the state of religion throughout\r\nthe country. It is enough here to say that if, with the law of liberty\r\nand the gospel of peace and purity within their hands, the inhabitants\r\nof the south are unconscious of the low state of the morals of society,\r\nsuch blindness proves nothing so much as how far that which is highest\r\nand purest may be confounded with what is lowest and foulest, when once\r\nthe fatal attempt has been entered upon to make them co-exist. From\r\ntheir co-existence, one further step may be taken; and in the south has\r\nbeen taken; the making the high and pure a sanction for the low and\r\nfoul. Of this, more hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe degradation of the women is so obvious a consequence of the evils\r\ndisclosed above, that the painful subject need not be enlarged on. By\r\nthe degradation of women, I do not mean to imply any doubt of the purity\r\nof their manners. There are reasons, plain enough to the observer, why\r\ntheir manners should be even peculiarly pure. They are all married\r\nyoung, from their being out-numbered by the other sex: and there is ever\r\npresent an unfortunate servile class of their own sex to serve the\r\npurposes of licentiousness, so as to leave them untempted. Their\r\ndegradation arises, not from their own conduct, but from that of all\r\nother parties about them. Where the generality of men carry secrets\r\nwhich their wives must be the last to know; where the busiest and more\r\nengrossing concerns of life must wear one aspect to the one sex, and\r\nanother to the other, there is an end to all wholesome confidence and\r\nsympathy, and woman sinks to be the ornament of her husband's house, the\r\ndomestic manager of his establishment, instead of being his\r\nall-sufficient friend. I am speaking not only of what I suppose must\r\nnecessarily be; but of what I have actually seen. I have seen, with\r\nheart-sorrow, the kind politeness, the gallantry, so insufficient to the\r\nloving heart, with which the wives of the south are treated by their\r\nhusbands. I have seen the horror of a woman's having to work,--to exert\r\nthe faculties which her Maker gave her;--the eagerness to ensure her\r\nunearned ease and rest; the deepest insult which can be offered to an\r\nintelligent and conscientious woman. I know the tone of conversation\r\nwhich is adopted towards women; different in its topics and its style\r\nfrom that which any man would dream of offering to any other man. I\r\nhave heard the boast of the chivalrous consideration in which women are\r\nheld throughout their woman's paradise; and seen something of the\r\nanguish of crushed pride, of the conflict of bitter feelings with which\r\nsuch boasts have been listened to by those whose aspirations teach them\r\nthe hollowness of the system. The gentlemen are all the while unaware\r\nthat women are not treated in the best possible manner among them: and\r\nthey will remain thus blind as long as licentious intercourse with the\r\nlowest of the sex unfits them for appreciating the highest. Whenever\r\ntheir society shall take rank according to moral rather than physical\r\nconsiderations; whenever they shall rise to crave sympathy in the real\r\nobjects of existence; whenever they shall begin to inquire what human\r\nlife is, and wherefore, and to reverence it accordingly, they will\r\nhumble themselves in shame for their abuse of the right of the\r\nstrongest; for those very arrangements and observances which now\r\nconstitute their boast. A lady who, brought up elsewhere to use her own\r\nfaculties, and employ them on such objects as she thinks proper, and who\r\nhas more knowledge and more wisdom than perhaps any gentleman of her\r\nacquaintance, told me of the disgust with which she submits to the\r\nconversation which is addressed to her, under the idea of being fit for\r\nher; and how she solaces herself at home, after such provocation, with\r\nthe silent sympathy of books. A father of promising young daughters,\r\nwhom he sees likely to be crushed by the system, told me, in a tone of\r\nvoice which I shall never forget, that women there might as well be\r\nturned into the street, for anything they are fit for. There are\r\nreasonable hopes that his children may prove an exception. One gentleman\r\nwho declares himself much interested in the whole subject, expresses his\r\nhorror of the employment of women in the northern States, for useful\r\npurposes. He told me that the same force of circumstances which, in the\r\nregion he inhabits, makes men independent, increases the dependence of\r\nwomen, and will go on to increase it. Society is there, he declared,\r\n\"always advancing towards orientalism.\" \"There are but two ways in which\r\nwoman can be exercised to the extent of her powers; by genius and by\r\ncalamity, either of which may strengthen her to burst her conventional\r\nrestraints. The first is too rare a circumstance to afford any basis for\r\nspeculation: and may Heaven avert the last!\" O, may Heaven hasten it!\r\nwould be the cry of many hearts, if these be indeed the conditions of\r\nwoman's fulfilling the purposes of her being. There are, I believe, some\r\nwho would scarcely tremble to see their houses in flames, to hear the\r\ncoming tornado, to feel the threatening earthquake, if these be indeed\r\nthe messengers who must open their prison doors, and give their\r\nheaven-born spirits the range of the universe. God has given to them the\r\nuniverse, as to others: man has caged them in one corner of it, and\r\ndreads their escape from their cage, while man does that which he would\r\nnot have woman hear of. He puts genius out of sight, and deprecates\r\ncalamity. He has not, however, calculated all the forces in nature. If\r\nhe had, he would hardly venture to hold either negroes or women as\r\nproperty, or to trust to the absence of genius and calamity.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable warning has been vouchsafed to him. A woman of strong\r\nmind, whose strenuous endeavours to soften the woes of slavery to her\r\nown dependents, failed to satisfy her conscience and relieve her human\r\naffections, her shaken the blood-slaked dust from her feet, and gone to\r\nlive where every man can call himself his own: and not only to live, but\r\nto work there, and to pledge herself to death, if necessary, for the\r\noverthrow of the system which she abhors in proportion to her\r\nfamiliarity with it. Whether we are to call her Genius or Calamity, or\r\nby her own honoured name of Angelina Grimke, certain it is that she is\r\nrousing into life and energy many women who were unconscious of genius,\r\nand unvisited by calamity, but who carry honest and strong human hearts.\r\nThis lady may ere long be found to have materially checked the \"advance\r\ntowards orientalism.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the children suffer, perhaps the most fatally of all, under\r\nthe slave system. What can be expected from little boys who are brought\r\nup to consider physical courage the highest attribute of manhood; pride\r\nof section and of caste its loftiest grace; the slavery of a part of\r\nsociety essential to the freedom of the rest; justice of less account\r\nthan generosity; and humiliation in the eyes of men the most intolerable\r\nof evils? What is to be expected of little girls who boast of having got\r\na negro flogged for being impertinent to them, and who are surprised at\r\nthe \"ungentlemanly\" conduct of a master who maims his slave? Such\r\nlessons are not always taught expressly. Sometimes the reverse is\r\nexpressly taught. But this is what the children in a slave country\r\nnecessarily learn from what passes around them; just as the plainest\r\ngirls in a school grow up to think personal beauty the most important of\r\nall endowments, in spite of daily assurances that the charms of the mind\r\nare all that are worth regarding.\r\n\r\nThe children of slave countries learn more and worse still. It is nearly\r\nimpossible to keep them from close intercourse with the slaves; and the\r\nattempt is rarely made. The generality of slaves are as gross as the\r\ntotal absence of domestic sanctity might be expected to render them.\r\nThey do not dream of any reserves with children. The consequences are\r\ninevitable. The woes of mothers from this cause are such that, if this\r\n\"peculiar domestic institution\" were confided to their charge, I believe\r\nthey would accomplish its overthrow with an energy and wisdom that would\r\nlook more like inspiration than orientalism. Among the incalculable\r\nforces in nature is the grief of mothers weeping for the corruption of\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nOne of the absolutely inevitable results of slavery is a disregard of\r\nhuman rights; an inability even to comprehend them. Probably the\r\nsouthern gentry, who declare that the presence of slavery enhances the\r\nlove of freedom; that freedom can be duly estimated only where a\r\nparticular class can appropriate all social privileges; that, to use the\r\nwords of one of them, \"they know too much of slavery to be slaves\r\nthemselves,\" are sincere enough in such declarations; and if so, it\r\nfollows that they do not know what freedom is. They may have the benefit\r\nof the alternative,--of not knowing what freedom is, and being sincere;\r\nor of knowing what freedom is, and not being sincere. I am disposed to\r\nthink that the first is the more common case.\r\n\r\nOne reason for my thinking so is, that I usually found in conversation\r\nin the south, that the idea of human rights was--sufficient subsistence\r\nin return for labour. This was assumed as the definition of human rights\r\non which we were to argue the case of the slave. When I tried the\r\ndefinition by the golden rule, I found that even that straight, simple\r\nrule had become singularly bent in the hands of those who profess to\r\nacknowledge and apply it. A clergyman preached from the pulpit the\r\nfollowing application of it, which is echoed unhesitatingly by the most\r\nreligious of the slave-holders:--\"Treat your slaves as you would wish to\r\nbe treated if you were a slave yourself.\" I verily believe that\r\nhundreds, or thousands, do not see that this is not an honest\r\napplication of the rule; so blinded are they by custom to the fact that\r\nthe negro is a man and a brother.\r\n\r\nAnother of my reasons for supposing that the gentry of the south do not\r\nknow what freedom is, is that many seem unconscious of the state of\r\ncoercion in which they themselves are living; coercion, not only from\r\nthe incessant fear of which I have before spoken,--a fear which haunts\r\ntheir homes, their business, and their recreations; coercion, not only\r\nfrom their fear, and from their being dependent for their hourly\r\ncomforts upon the extinguished or estranged will of those whom they have\r\ninjured; but coercion also from their own laws. The laws against the\r\npress are as peremptory as in the most despotic countries of Europe:[18]\r\nas may be seen in the small number and size, and poor quality, of the\r\nnewspapers of the south. I never saw, in the rawest villages of the\r\nyoungest States, newspapers so empty and poor as those of New Orleans.\r\nIt is curious that, while the subject of the abolition of slavery in the\r\nBritish colonies was necessarily a very interesting one throughout the\r\nsouthern States, I met with planters who did not know that any\r\ncompensation had been paid by the British nation to the West Indian\r\nproprietors. The miserable quality of the southern newspapers, and the\r\nomission from them of the subjects on which the people most require\r\ninformation, will go far to account for the people's delusions on their\r\nown affairs, as compared with those of the rest of the world, and for\r\ntheir boasts of freedom, which probably arise from their knowing of none\r\nwhich is superior. They see how much more free they are than their own\r\nslaves; but are not generally aware what liberty is where all are free.\r\nIn 1834, the number of newspapers was, in the State of New York, 267; in\r\nLouisiana, 31; in Massachusetts, 108; in South Carolina, 19; in\r\nPennsylvania, 220; in Georgia, 29.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be thought of the freedom of gentlemen subject to the\r\nfollowing law? \"Any person or persons who shall attempt to teach any\r\nfree person of colour, or slave, to spell, read, or write, shall, upon\r\nconviction thereof by indictment, be fined in a sum not less than two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars, nor more than five hundred dollars.\"[19]\r\n\r\nWhat is to be thought of the freedom of gentlemen who cannot emancipate\r\ntheir own slaves, except by the consent of the legislature; and then\r\nonly under very strict conditions, which make the deed almost\r\nimpracticable? It has been mentioned that during a temporary suspension\r\nof the laws against emancipation in Virginia, 10,000 slaves were freed\r\nin nine years; and that, as the institution seemed in peril, the masters\r\nwere again coerced. It is pleaded that the masters themselves were the\r\nrepealers and re-enactors of these laws. True: and thus it appears that\r\nthey thought it necessary to deprive each other of a liberty which a\r\ngreat number seem to have made use of themselves, while they could. No\r\nhigh degree of liberty, or of the love of it, is to be seen here. The\r\nlaws which forbid emancipation are felt to be cruelly galling,\r\nthroughout the south. I heard frequent bitter complaints of them. They\r\nare the invariable plea urged by individuals to excuse their continuing\r\nto hold slaves. Such individuals are either sincere in these complaints,\r\nor they are not. If they are not, they must be under some deplorable\r\ncoercion which compels so large a multitude to hypocrisy. If they are\r\nsincere, they possess the common republican means of getting tyrannical\r\nlaws repealed: and why do they not use them? If these laws are felt to\r\nbe oppressive, why is no voice heard denouncing them in the\r\nlegislatures? If men complainingly, but voluntarily, submit to laws\r\nwhich bind the conscience, little can be said of their love of liberty.\r\nIf they submit involuntarily, nothing can be said for their possession\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWhat, again, is to be thought of the freedom of citizens who are liable\r\nto lose caste because they follow conscience in a case where the\r\nperversity of the laws places interest on the side of conscience, and\r\npublic opinion against it? I will explain. In a southern city, I saw a\r\ngentleman who appeared to have all the outward requisites for commanding\r\nrespect. He was very wealthy, had been governor of the State, and was an\r\neminent and peculiar benefactor to the city. I found he did not stand\r\nwell. As some pains were taken to impress me with this, I inquired the\r\ncause. His character was declared to be generally good. I soon got at\r\nthe particular exception, which I was anxious to do only because I saw\r\nthat it was somehow of public concern. While this gentleman was\r\ngovernor, there was an insurrection of slaves. His own slaves were\r\naccused. He did not believe them guilty, and refused to hang them. This\r\nwas imputed to an unwillingness to sacrifice his property. He was thus\r\nin a predicament which no one can be placed in, except where man is held\r\nas property. He must either hang his slaves, believing them innocent,\r\nand keep his character; or he must, by saving their lives, lose his own\r\ncharacter. How the case stood with this gentleman, is fully known only\r\nto his own heart. His conduct claims the most candid construction. But,\r\nthis being accorded as his due, what can be thought of the freedom of a\r\nrepublican thus circumstanced?\r\n\r\nPassing over the perils, physical and moral, in which those are involved\r\nwho live in a society where recklessness of life is treated with\r\nleniency, and physical courage stands high in the list of virtues and\r\ngraces,--perils which abridge a man's liberty of action and of speech in\r\na way which would be felt to be intolerable if the restraint were not\r\nadorned by the false name of Honour,--it is only necessary to look at\r\nthe treatment of the abolitionists by the south, by both legislatures\r\nand individuals, to see that no practical understanding of liberty\r\nexists there.\r\n\r\nUpon a mere vague report, or bare suspicion, persons travelling through\r\nthe south have been arrested, imprisoned, and, in some cases, flogged or\r\notherwise tortured, on pretence that such persons desired to cause\r\ninsurrection among the slaves. More than one innocent person has been\r\nhanged; and the device of terrorism has been so practised as to deprive\r\nthe total number of persons who avowedly hold a certain set of opinions,\r\nof their constitutional liberty of traversing the whole country. It was\r\ndeclared by some liberal-minded gentlemen of South Carolina, after the\r\npublication of Dr. Channing's work on Slavery, that if Dr. Channing were\r\nto enter South Carolina with a body-guard of 20,000 men, he could not\r\ncome out alive. I have seen the lithographic prints, transmitted in\r\nletters to abolitionists, representing the individual to whom the letter\r\nwas sent hanging on a gallows. I have seen the hand-bills, purporting to\r\nbe issued by Committees of Vigilance, offering enormous rewards for the\r\nheads, or for the ears, of prominent abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that these acts are attributable to the ignorant wrath of\r\nindividuals only, it may be asked whence arose the Committees of\r\nVigilance, which were last year sitting throughout the south and west,\r\non the watch for any incautious person who might venture near them, with\r\nanti-slavery opinions in his mind? How came it that high official\r\npersons sat on these committees? How is it that some governors of\r\nsouthern States made formal application to governors of the northern\r\nStates to procure the dispersion of anti-slavery societies, the\r\nrepression of discussion, and the punishment of the promulgators of\r\nabolition opinions? How is it that the governor of South Carolina last\r\nyear recommended the summary execution, without benefit of clergy, of\r\nall persons caught within the limits of the State, holding avowed\r\nanti-slavery opinions; and that every sentiment of the governor's was\r\nendorsed by a select committee of the legislature?\r\n\r\nAll this proceeds from an ignorance of the first principles of liberty.\r\nIt cannot be from a mere hypocritical disregard of such principles; for\r\nproud men, who boast a peculiar love of liberty and aptitude for it,\r\nwould not voluntarily make themselves so ridiculous as they appear by\r\nthese outrageous proceedings. Such blustering is so hopeless, and, if\r\nnot sincere, so purposeless, that no other supposition is left than that\r\nthey have lost sight of the fundamental principles of both their federal\r\nand State constitutions, and do now actually suppose that their own\r\nfreedom lies in crushing all opposition to their own will. No pretence\r\nof evidence has been offered of any further offence against them than\r\nthe expression of obnoxious opinions. There is no plea that any of their\r\nlaws have been violated, except those recently enacted to annihilate\r\nfreedom of speech and the press: laws which can in no case be binding\r\nupon persons out of the limits of the States for which these new laws\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nThe amended constitution of Virginia, of 1830, provides that the\r\nlegislature shall not pass \"any law abridging the freedom of speech or\r\nof the press.\" North and South Carolina and Georgia decree that the\r\nfreedom of the press shall be preserved inviolate; the press being the\r\ngrand bulwark of liberty. The constitution of Louisiana declares that\r\n\"the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the\r\ninvaluable rights of man; and every citizen may freely speak, write, and\r\nprint, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\"\r\nThe Declaration of Rights of Mississippi declares that \"no law shall\r\never be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech, and of the\r\npress.\" The constitutions of all the slave States contain declarations\r\nand provisions like these. How fearfully have the descendants of those\r\nwho framed them degenerated in their comprehension and practice of\r\nliberty, violating both the spirit and the letter of their original Bill\r\nof Rights! They are not yet fully aware of this. In the calmer times\r\nwhich are to come, they will perceive it, and look back with amazement\r\nupon the period of desperation, when not a voice was heard, even in the\r\nlegislatures, to plead for human rights; when, for the sake of one\r\ndoomed institution, they forgot what their fathers had done, fettered\r\ntheir own presses, tied their own hands, robbed their fellow-citizens\r\nof their right of free travelling, and did all they could to deprive\r\nthose same fellow-citizens of liberty and life, for the avowal and\r\npromulgation of opinions.\r\n\r\nMeantime, it would be but decent to forbear all boasts of a superior\r\nknowledge and love of freedom.\r\n\r\nHere I gladly break off my dark chapter on the Morals of Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nMORALS OF MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable effect of democratic institutions is the excellence of\r\nthe work turned out by those who live under them. In a country where the\r\nwhole course is open to every one; where, in theory, everything may be\r\nobtained by merit, men have the strongest stimulus to exert their\r\npowers, and try what they can achieve. I found master-workmen, who\r\nemploy operatives of various nations, very sensible of this. Elsewhere,\r\nno artisan can possibly rise higher than to a certain point of\r\ndexterity, and amount of wages. In America, an artisan may attain to be\r\ngovernor of the State; member of Congress; even President. Instead of\r\nthis possibility having the effect of turning his head, and making him\r\nunfit for business, (as some suppose, who seem to consider these\r\nopportunities as resembling the chances of a lottery,) it attaches him\r\nto his business and his master, to sober habits, and to intellectual\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe only apparent excess to which it leads is ill-considered\r\nenterprise. This is an evil sometimes to the individual, but not to\r\nsociety. A man who makes haste to be famous or rich by means of new\r\ninventions, may injure his own fortune or credit, but is usually a\r\nbenefactor to society, by furnishing a new idea on which another may\r\nwork with more success. Some of the most important improvements in the\r\nmanufactures of the United States have been made by men who afterwards\r\nbecame insolvent. Where there is hasty enterprise, there is usually much\r\nconceit. The very haste seems to show that the man is thinking more of\r\nhimself than of the subject on which he is employed. It naturally\r\nhappens that the conceited originator breaks down in the middle of his\r\nscheme; and that some more patient, modest thinker takes it up where he\r\nleaves off, and completes the invention. I was shown, at the Paterson\r\nmills, an invention completed by two men on the spot, whose discovery\r\nhas been extensively adopted in England. A workman fancied he had\r\ndiscovered a method by which he could twist rovings, fastened at both\r\nends, quicker than had ever been done before. As a more thoughtful\r\nperson would have foreseen, half the twisting came undone, as soon as\r\nthe ends were unfastened. The projector threw his work aside; but a\r\nquiet observer among his brother workmen offered him a partnership and a\r\nnew idea, in return for the primary suggestion. The quiet man saw how\r\nquickly the thread might be prepared, if the rovings could be condensed\r\nfast enough for the twisting. He added his discovery to what the first\r\nhad really achieved; and the success was complete.\r\n\r\nThe factories are found to afford a safe and useful employment for much\r\nenergy which would otherwise be wasted and misdirected. I found that in\r\nsome places very bad morals had prevailed before the introduction of\r\nmanufactures; while now the same society is eminently orderly. The great\r\nevil still is drunkenness: but of this there is less than there used to\r\nbe; and other disorders have almost entirely disappeared. A steady\r\nemployer has it in his power to do more for the morals of the society\r\nabout him than the clergy themselves. The experiment has been tried,\r\nwith entire success, of dismissing from the mills any who have been\r\nguilty of open vice. This is submitted to, because it is obviously\r\nreasonable that the sober workmen who remain should be protected from\r\nassociation with vicious persons who must be offensive or dangerous to\r\nthem. If any employer has the firmness to dismiss unquestionable\r\noffenders, however valuable their services may be to him, he may\r\nconfidently look for a cessation of such offences, and for a great\r\npurification of the society in which they have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe morals of the female factory population may be expected to be good\r\nwhen it is considered of what class it is composed. Many of the girls\r\nare in the factories because they have too much pride for domestic\r\nservice. Girls who are too proud for domestic service as it is in\r\nAmerica, can hardly be low enough for any gross immorality; or to need\r\nwatching; or not to be trusted to avoid the contagion of evil example.\r\nTo a stranger, their pride seems to take a mistaken direction, and they\r\nappear to deprive themselves of a respectable home and station, and many\r\nbenefits, by their dislike of service: but this is altogether their own\r\naffair. They must choose for themselves their way of life. But the\r\nreasons of their choice indicate a state of mind superior to the\r\ngrossest dangers of their position.\r\n\r\nI saw a bill fixed up in the Waltham mill which bore a warning that no\r\nyoung lady who attended dancing-school that winter should be employed:\r\nand that the corporation had given directions to the overseer to dismiss\r\nany one who should be found to dance at the school. I asked the meaning\r\nof this; and the overseer's answer was, \"Why, we had some trouble last\r\nwinter about the dancing-school. It must, of course, be held in the\r\nevening, as the young folks are in the mill all day. They are very\r\nyoung, many of them; and they forget the time, and everything but the\r\namusement, and dance away till two or three in the morning. Then they\r\nare unfit for their work the next day; or, if they get properly through\r\ntheir work, it is at the expense of their health. So we have forbidden\r\nthe dancing-school; but, to make up for it, I have promised them that,\r\nas soon as the great new room at the hotel is finished, we will have a\r\ndance once a-fortnight. We shall meet and break up early; and my wife\r\nand I will dance; and we will all dance together.\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry to see one bad and very unnecessary arrangement, in all the\r\nmanufacturing establishments. In England, the best friends of the poor\r\nare accustomed to think it the crowning hardship of their condition that\r\nsolitude is wholly forbidden to them. It is impossible that any human\r\nbeing should pass his life as well as he might do who is never\r\nalone,--who is not frequently alone. This is a weighty truth which can\r\nnever be explained away. The silence, freedom and collectedness of\r\nsolitude are absolutely essential to the health of the mind; and no\r\nsubstitute for this repose (or change of activity) is possible. In the\r\ndwellings of the English poor, parents and children are crowded into one\r\nroom, for want of space and of furniture. All wise parents above the\r\nrank of poor, make it a primary consideration so to arrange their\r\nfamilies as that each member may, at some hour, have some place where he\r\nmay enter in, and shut his door, and feel himself alone. If possible,\r\nthe sleeping places are so ordered. In America, where space is of far\r\nless consequence, where the houses are large, where the factory girls\r\ncan build churches, and buy libraries, and educate brothers for learned\r\nprofessions, these same girls have no private apartments, and sometimes\r\nsleep six or eight in a room, and even three in a bed. This is very bad.\r\nIt shows a want of inclination for solitude; an absence of that need of\r\nit which every healthy mind must feel, in a greater or less degree.\r\n\r\nNow are the days when these gregarious habits should be broken through.\r\nNew houses are being daily built: more parents are bringing their\r\nchildren to the factories. If the practice be now adopted, by the\r\ncorporations, or by the parents who preside over separate\r\nestablishments, of partitioning off the large sleeping apartments into\r\nsmall ones which shall hold each one occupant, the expense of partitions\r\nand windows and trouble will not be worth a moment's consideration in\r\ncomparison with the improvement in intelligence, morals, and manners,\r\nwhich will be found to result from such an arrangement. If the change be\r\nnot soon made, the American factory population, with all its advantages\r\nof education and of pecuniary sufficiency, will be found, as its numbers\r\nincrease, to have been irreparably injured by its subjection to a\r\ngrievance which is considered the very heaviest to which poverty exposes\r\nartisans in old countries. Man's own silent thoughts are his best\r\nsafeguard and highest privilege. Of the full advantage of this\r\nsafeguard, of the full enjoyment of this privilege, the innocent and\r\nindustrious youth of a new country ought, by no mismanagement, to be\r\ndeprived.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nMORALS OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nIt is said in the United States that Commerce and the Navy are\r\npatronised by the federal party; as agriculture is, and the army would\r\nbe, if there was one, by the democratic party. This is true enough. The\r\ngreater necessity for co-operation, and therefore for the partial\r\nsacrifice of independence, imposed by commercial pursuits, is more\r\nagreeable to the aristocratic portion of society than to its opposite.\r\nYet, while commerce has been spreading and improving, federalism has\r\ndwindled away; and most remarkably where commerce is carried on in its\r\nutmost activity: in Massachusetts. The democracy are probably finding\r\nout that more is gained by the concentration of the popular will than is\r\nlost in the way of individual independence, by men being brought\r\ntogether for objects which require concession and mutual subordination.\r\nHowever this may be, the spirit of commerce in the United States is, on\r\nthe whole, honourable to the people.\r\n\r\nI shall have to speak hereafter of the regard to wealth, as the most\r\nimportant object in life, which extensively corrupts Americans as it\r\ndoes all other society. Here, I have to speak only of the spirit in\r\nwhich one method of procuring wealth is prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the commercial spirit in America is represented abroad,\r\nand too often at home, as indicative of nothing but sordid love of gain:\r\na making haste to be rich, a directly selfish desire of aggrandisement.\r\nThis view of the case seems to me narrow and injurious. I believe that\r\nmany desires, various energies, some nobler and some meaner, find in\r\ncommerce a centre for their activity. I have studied with some care the\r\nminds and manners of a variety of merchants, and other persons engaged\r\nin commerce, and have certainly found a regard to money a more\r\nsuperficial and intermitting influence than various others.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of enterprise is very remarkable in the American merchants.\r\nBeginning life, as all Americans do, with the world all open before\r\nthem, and only a head and a pair of hands wherewith to gain it, a\r\npassionate desire to overcome difficulties arises in them. Being, (as I\r\nhave before declared my opinion,) the most imaginative people in the\r\nworld, the whole world rises fair before them, and they, not believing\r\nin impossibilities, long to conquer it.\r\n\r\nThen, there is the meaner love of distinction; meaner than the love of\r\nenterprise, but higher than the desire of gain. The distinction sought\r\nis not always that which attends on superior wealth only; but on\r\nworld-wide intercourses, on extensive affairs, on hospitality to a large\r\nvariety of foreigners.\r\n\r\nAgain; there is the love of Art. Weak, immature, ignorant, perhaps, as\r\nthis taste at present is, it exists: and indications of it which merit\r\nall respect, are to be found in many abodes. There are other, though not\r\nperhaps such lofty ways of pursuing art, than by embodying conceptions\r\nin pictures, statues, operas, and buildings. The love of Beauty and of\r\nthe ways of Humanity may indicate and gratify itself by other and\r\nsimpler methods than those which the high artists of the old world have\r\nsanctified. If any one can witness the meeting of one kind of American\r\nmerchant with his supercargo, after a long, distant voyage, hear the\r\nquestioning and answering, and witness the delight with which new\r\ncuriosities are examined, and new theories of beauty and civilisation\r\nare put forth upon the impulse of the moment, and still doubt the\r\nexistence of a love of art, still suppose the desire of gain the moving\r\nspring of that man's mind,--may Heaven preserve the community from being\r\npronounced upon by such an observer! The critic with the stop-watch is\r\nmagnanimous in comparison.\r\n\r\nAgain; there is the human eagerness after an object once adopted. In\r\nthis case, it may be money, as in other cases it may be Queen Anne's\r\nfarthings, the knockers of doors, ancient books, (for their editions and\r\nnot their contents,) pet animals, autographs, or any other merely\r\noutward object whose charm lies in the pursuit. Several men of business,\r\nwhose activity has made them very wealthy, have told me that, though\r\nthey would not openly declare what would look like a boast, and would\r\nnot be believed, the truth was that they should not care if they lost\r\nevery dollar they had. They knew themselves well enough to perceive that\r\nthe pleasure was in the pursuit, and not in the dollars: and I thought I\r\nknew some of them well enough to perceive that it would be rather a\r\nrelief to have their money swept away, that they might again be as busy\r\nas ever in a mode which had become pleasant to them by habit and\r\nsuccess. Of course, I am not speaking of such as of a very high and\r\nhappy order; as to be for a moment compared with the few whose pursuits\r\nare of an unfailing but perpetually satisfying kind; with those whose\r\nrecompense is incessant, but never fulfilled. I am only declaring that\r\nthe eager pursuit of wealth does not necessarily indicate a love of\r\nwealth for its own sake.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? What are the manifestations of the character of the\r\nAmerican merchants? After their eager money-getting, how do they spend\r\nit? How much do they prize it?\r\n\r\nTheir benevolence is known throughout the world: not only that\r\nbenevolence which founds and endows charities, and repairs to sufferers\r\nthe mischief of accidents; but that which establishes schools of a\r\nhigher order than common, and brings forward in life the most\r\nmeritorious of those who are educated there; the benevolence which\r\nwatches over the condition of seamen on the ocean, and their safety at\r\nhome; the benevolence which busies itself, with much expense of dollars\r\nand trouble, to provide for the improved civilisation of the whole of\r\nsociety. If the most liberal institutions in the northern States were\r\nexamined into, it would be found how active the merchant class has been,\r\nbeyond all others, in their establishment.\r\n\r\nAgain: their eager money-getting is not for purposes of accumulation.\r\nSome--many, are deplorably ostentatious; but it seemed to me that the\r\nostentation was an after-thought; though it might lead to renewed\r\nmoney-getting. Money was first gained. What was to be done with it? One\r\nmight as well outshine one's neighbours, especially as this would be a\r\nfresh stimulus to get more still. This is bad; but it is not sordidness.\r\nInstances of accumulation are extremely rare. The miser is with them an\r\nantique, classical kind of personage, pictured forth as having on a high\r\ncap, a long gown, and sitting in a vaulted chamber, amidst money-chests.\r\nIt would, I believe, be difficult there to find a pair of eyes that have\r\nlooked upon a real living and breathing miser. My account of the doings\r\nof a miser whom I used wondering to watch in the days of my childhood\r\nnever failed to excite amazement, very like incredulity, in those I was\r\nconversing with. The best proof that the money-getting of the eminently\r\nsuccessful merchants of America is not for money's sake, lies in the\r\nfact, that in New England, peopled by more than 2,000,000 of\r\ninhabitants, there are not more than 500, probably not more than 400\r\nindividuals, who can be called affluent men; possessing, that is,\r\n100,000 dollars and upwards. A prosperous community, in which a sordid\r\npursuit of wealth was common, would be in a very different state from\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe bankruptcies in the United States are remarkably frequent and\r\ndisgraceful,--disgraceful in their nature, though not sufficiently so in\r\nthe eyes of society. A clergyman in a commercial city declares that\r\nalmost every head of a family in his congregation has been a bankrupt\r\nsince his settlement. In Philadelphia, from six to eight hundred persons\r\nannually take the benefit of the insolvent laws; and numerous\r\ncompromises take place which are not heard of further than the parties\r\nconcerned in them. On seeing the fine house of a man who was a bankrupt\r\nfour years before, and who was then worth 100,000 dollars, I asked\r\nwhether such cases were common, and was grieved to find they were. Some\r\ninsolvents pay their old debts when they rise again; but the greater\r\nnumber do not. This laxity of morals is favoured by the circumstances of\r\nthe community, which require the industry of all its members, and can\r\nemploy the resources of all,--first, of men of character, and then of\r\nspeculators. But, few things are more disgraceful to American society\r\nthan the carelessness with which speculators are allowed to game with\r\nother people's funds, and, after ruining those who put trust in them, to\r\nlift up their heads in all places, just as if they had, during their\r\nwhole lives, rendered unto all their dues. Whatever may be the causes or\r\nthe palliations of speculation; whatever may be pleaded about currency\r\nmistakes, and the temptations to young men to make fortunes by the\r\npublic lands, one thing is clear; that no man, who, having failed, and\r\nafterwards having the means to pay his debts in full, does not pay them,\r\ncan be regarded as an honest man, and ought to be received upon the same\r\nfooting with honest men, whatever may be his accomplishments, or his\r\nsubsequent fortune. What would be thought of any society which should\r\ncherish an escaped (not reformed) thief, because a large legacy had\r\nenabled him to set up his carriage? Yet how much difference is there in\r\nthe two cases? It is very rarely a duty,--more rarely than is generally\r\nsupposed, to mark and shun the guilty. It is usually more right to seek\r\nand help him. But, in the case of a spreading vice, which is viewed with\r\nincreasing levity, the reprobation of the honest portion of society\r\nought to be very distinct and emphatic. Those who would not associate\r\nwith escaped thieves should avoid prosperous bankrupts who are not\r\nthinking of paying their debts.\r\n\r\nThe gravest sin chargeable upon the merchants of the United States is\r\ntheir conduct on the abolition question. This charge is by no means\r\ngeneral. There are instances of a manly declaration of opinion on the\r\nside of freedom, and also of a spirit of self-sacrifice in the cause,\r\nwhich can hardly be surpassed for nobleness. There are merchants who\r\nhave thrown up their commerce with the south when there was reason to\r\nbelieve that its gains were wrung from the slave; and there are many who\r\nhave freely poured out their money, and risked their reputation, in\r\ndefence of the abolition cause, and of liberty of speech and the press.\r\nBut the reproach of the persecution of the abolitionists, and of\r\ntampering with the fundamental liberties of the people, rests mainly\r\nwith the merchants of the northern States.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remembrance that the Abolition movement originated from\r\nthe sordid act of a merchant. While Garrison was at Baltimore, studying\r\nthe Colonisation scheme, a ship belonging to a merchant of Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts, arrived at Baltimore to take freight for New Orleans.\r\nThere was some difficulty about the expected cargo. The captain was\r\noffered a freight of slaves, wrote to the merchant for leave, and\r\nreceived orders to carry these slaves to New Orleans. Garrison poured\r\nout, in a libel, (so called,) his indignation against this deed,\r\ncommitted by a man who, as a citizen of Massachusetts, thanks God every\r\nThanksgiving Day that the soil of his State is untrod by the foot of a\r\nslave. Garrison was fined and imprisoned; and after his release, was\r\nwarmly received in New York, where he lectured upon Abolition; from\r\nwhich time, the cause has gained strength so as to have now become\r\nunconquerable.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of this Newburyport merchant has dwelt in too many of the\r\nsame vocation. The Faneuil Hall meeting was convened chiefly by\r\nmerchants; and they have been conspicuous in all the mobs. They have\r\nkept the clergy dumb: they have overawed the colleges, given their cue\r\nto the newspapers, and shown a spirit of contempt and violence,\r\nequalling even that of the slave-holders, towards those who, in acting\r\nupon their honest convictions, have appeared likely to affect their\r\nsources of profit. At Cincinnati, they were chiefly merchants who met to\r\ndestroy the right of discussion; and passed a resolution directly\r\nrecommendatory of violence for this purpose. They were merchants who\r\nwaited in deputation on the editor of the anti-slavery newspaper there,\r\nto intimidate him from the use of his constitutional liberty, and who\r\nmade themselves by these acts answerable for the violences which\r\nfollowed. This was so clear, that they were actually taunted by their\r\nslave-holding neighbours, on the other side of the river, with their\r\nsordidness in attempting to extinguish the liberties of the republic for\r\nthe sake of their own pecuniary gains.\r\n\r\nThe day will come when their eyes will be cleansed from the gold-dust\r\nwhich blinds them. Meanwhile, as long as they continue active against\r\nthe most precious rights of the community; as long as they may be fairly\r\nconsidered more guilty on this tremendous question of Human Wrongs than\r\neven the slave-holders of the south,--more guilty than any class\r\nwhatever, except the clergy,--let them not boast of their liberality and\r\ntheir benevolence. Generosity loses half its grace when it does not\r\nco-exist with justice. Those can ill be esteemed benefactors to the\r\ncommunity in one direction, who are unfaithful to their citizenship in\r\nanother. Till such can be roused from their delusion, and can see their\r\nconduct as others see it, the esteem of the world must rest on those of\r\ntheir class who, to the graces of enterprise, liberality, and taste, add\r\nthe higher merit of intrepid, self-sacrificing fidelity to the cause of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] In testimony of the fact that the working people of this region are\r\nthinkers too, I subjoin a note written by the wife of a village\r\nmechanic, who is a fair specimen of her class.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--Nothing but a consciousness of my own incompetency to form a just\r\nopinion on a question of such magnitude, and one too which involves\r\nconsequences as remote from my personal observation, as the immediate,\r\nor gradual emancipation of the slaves, has, for some time, prevented my\r\nbeing an acknowledged abolitionist. With the Divine precepts before me,\r\nwhich require us to love our neighbour as ourselves, and 'whatsoever we\r\nwould that others should do to us,' etc. etc., instructed and admonished\r\ntoo by the feelings of common humanity, I cannot hesitate to pronounce\r\nthe system of slavery an outrageous violation of the requirements of\r\nGod, and a lawless and cruel invasion of the rights of our fellow men.\r\nIn this view of it, I am not able to understand how it can be persisted\r\nin, without setting at defiance the dictates of reason and conscience,\r\nand what is of more importance, the uncompromising authority of\r\nScripture, the arguments of wise and talented men to the contrary,\r\nnotwithstanding. The most superficial observer cannot fail to discern,\r\nin the universal interest and agitation, which prevail on this subject,\r\na prelude to some mighty revolution. If this 'war of words' is the\r\n_worst_ that will precede or accompany it, I shall be happily\r\ndisappointed. With these feelings, sir, you will readily believe the\r\nassurance, that I have been greatly interested, and instructed, in\r\nreading the mild, comprehensive, intelligent 'lecture,' of your lamented\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n[14] See Appendix C: an admirable sketch by a resident of Charleston, of\r\nthe interior of a planter's family. It unconsciously bears out all that\r\ncan be said of the educational evils of the existing state of society in\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n[15] I went with a lady in whose house I was staying to dine, one\r\nSunday, on a neighbouring estate. Her husband happened not to be with\r\nus, as he had to ride in another direction. The carriage was ordered for\r\neight in the evening. It drew up to the door at six; and the driver, a\r\nslave, said his master had sent him, and begged we would go home\r\ndirectly. We did so, and found my host very much surprised to see us\r\nhome so early. The message was a fiction of the slave's, who wanted to\r\nget his horses put up, that he might enjoy his Sunday evening. His\r\nmaster and mistress laughed, and took no further notice.\r\n\r\n[16] The law declares that the children of slaves are to follow the\r\nfortunes of the mother. Hence the practice of planters selling and\r\nbequeathing their own children.\r\n\r\n[17] I knew of the death of four men by summary burning alive, within\r\nthirteen months of my residence in the United States.\r\n\r\n[18] No notice is taken of any occurrence, however remarkable, in which\r\na person of colour, free or enslaved, has any share, for fear of the\r\nActs which denounce death or imprisonment for life against those who\r\nshall write, print, publish, or distribute anything having a tendency to\r\nexcite discontent or insubordination, &c.; or which doom to heavy fines\r\nthose who shall use or issue language which may disturb \"the security of\r\nmasters with their slaves, or diminish that respect which is commanded\r\nto free people of colour for the whites.\"\r\n\r\n[19] Alabama Digest. In the same section occurs the following: \"That no\r\ncruel or unusual punishment shall be inflicted on any slave within this\r\nterritory. And any owner of slaves authorising or permitting the same,\r\nshall, on conviction thereof, before any court having cognizance, be\r\nfined according to the nature of the offence, and at the discretion of\r\nthe court, in any sum not exceeding two hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hundred dollars' fine for torturing a slave: and five hundred for\r\nteaching him to read!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nCIVILISATION.\r\n\r\n     \"This country, which has given to the world the example of physical\r\n     liberty, owes to it that of moral emancipation also; for as yet it\r\n     is but nominal with us. The inquisition of public opinion\r\n     overwhelms, in practice, the freedom asserted by the laws in\r\n     theory.\"\r\n\r\n     _Jefferson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degree of civilisation of any people corresponds with the exaltation\r\nof the idea which is the most prevalent among that people. The prominent\r\nidea of savages is the necessity of providing for the supply of the\r\ncommonest bodily wants. The first steps in civilisation, therefore, are\r\nsomewhat refined methods of treating the body. When, by combination of\r\nlabour and other exercises of ingenuity, the wants of the body are\r\nsupplied with regularity and comparative ease, the love of pleasure, the\r\nlove of idleness, succeeds. Then comes the desire of wealth; and next,\r\nthe regard to opinion. Further than this no nation has yet attained.\r\nIndividuals there have been, probably in every nation under heaven, who\r\nhave lived for a higher idea than any of these; and insulated customs\r\nand partial legislation have, among all communities, shown a tendency\r\ntowards something loftier than the prevalent morality. The majesty of\r\nhigher ideas is besides so irresistible, that an involuntary homage,\r\npurely inefficacious, has been offered to them from of old by the\r\nleaders of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 \"Earth is sick,\r\n     And Heaven is weary of the hollow words\r\n     Which States and Kingdoms utter when they talk\r\n     Of truth and justice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThough, as yet, \"profession mocks performance,\" the profession, from age\r\nto age, of the same lofty something not yet attained, may be taken as a\r\nclear prophecy of ultimate performance. It shows a perception, however\r\ndim, a regard, however feeble, from which endeavour and attainment\r\ncannot but follow, in course of time. But the time is not yet. In the\r\nold world, the transition is, in its most enlightened parts, only\r\nbeginning to be made, from the few governing the many avowedly for the\r\ngood of the few, to governing the many professedly for the good of the\r\nmany. The truth and justice under whose dominion every man would\r\nreverence all other men, would renounce himself for the sake of others,\r\nand feel it to be the highest destiny \"not to be ministered unto, but to\r\nminister,\" are still \"hollow words.\" The civilisation of the old world\r\nstill corresponds with the low idea, that man lives in and for the\r\noutward, in and for what is around him rather than what is within him.\r\nIt is still supposed, that whatever a few individuals say and do, the\r\ngenerality of men live for wealth, outward ease and dignity, and, at the\r\nhighest, lofty reputation. The degree of civilisation corresponds with\r\nthis. There is scarcely an institution or a custom which supposes\r\nanything higher. What educational arrangements there are, are new, and\r\n(however praiseworthy as being an actual advance) are so narrow and\r\nmeagre as to show how unaccustomed is the effort to consider the man as\r\nnobler than the unit of society. The phrase is still the commonest of\r\nphrases in which parents, guardians, schoolmasters and statesmen embody\r\ntheir ambition for their wards--that any such ward \"may become a useful\r\nand respectable member of society.\" The greater number of guardians\r\nwould be terrified at the idea of their wards becoming anything else;\r\nanything higher than \"useful and respectable members of society,\" while\r\nit is as clear as noon-day that room ought to be left,--that facilities\r\nought to be afforded for every one becoming whatsoever his Maker has\r\nfitted him to be, so long as it appears that the noblest men by whom the\r\nearth has been graced, have been considered in their own time the very\r\nreverse of \"useful and respectable members of society.\" The most godlike\r\nof the race have been esteemed \"pestilent fellows\" in their day and\r\ngeneration. No student of the ways of Providence will repine at this\r\norder of affairs, or expect that any arrangement of society can be made\r\nby which the convictions and sympathies of the less gifted should be\r\nenabled suddenly to overtake those of the more gifted. He will not\r\ndesire to change the great and good laws by which the chosen of his race\r\nare \"made perfect through sufferings,\" and by which the light of reason\r\nis ordained to brighten very gradually from dawn into day. He will only\r\ntake note of the fact, that it is a low state of civilisation which\r\npresupposes specified and outward aims, and relies with such confidence\r\non the mechanical means of attaining them as to be shocked, or anything\r\nbut gratified, at the pursuit of singular objects by unusual methods.\r\nThe observer will rightly judge such to be a low state of civilisation,\r\nwhatever lamentations or exultations he may daily hear about the very\r\nhigh point civilisation has reached, when the schoolmaster is abroad,\r\nwhen people can travel at the rate of fifty miles an hour, and eminent\r\ncooks are paid 1,200l. a-year. While truth and justice remain \"hollow\r\nwords,\" so far as that men cannot live for them, to the detriment of\r\ntheir fortunes, without being called mischievous and disreputable\r\nmembers of society, no one can reasonably speak of the high civilisation\r\nof the country to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThe old world naturally looks with interest to the new, to see what\r\npoint of civilisation it reaches under fresh circumstances. The interest\r\nmay be undefined, and partly unconscious; but it is very eager. The\r\nmany, who conceive of no other objects of general pursuit than the old\r\nones of wealth, ease, and honour, look only to see under what forms\r\nthese are pursued. The few, who lay the blame of the grovelling at home\r\nupon outward restrictions alone, look to America with extravagant\r\nexpectations of a perfect reign of virtue and happiness, because the\r\nAmericans live in outward freedom. What is the truth?\r\n\r\nWhile the republics of North America are new, the ideas of the people\r\nare old. While these republics were colonies, they contained an old\r\npeople, living under old institutions, in a new country. Now they are a\r\nmixed people, infant as a nation, with a constant accession of minds\r\nfrom old countries, living in a new country, under institutions newly\r\ncombined out of old elements. It is a case so singular, that the old\r\nworld may well have patience for some time, to see what will arise. The\r\nold world must have patience; for the Americans have no national\r\ncharacter yet; nor can have, for a length of years. It matters not that\r\nthey think they have: or it matters only so far as it shows to what they\r\ntend. Their veneration of Washington has led them to suppose that he is\r\nthe type of their nation. Their patriotic feelings are so far\r\nassociated with him that they conclude the nation is growing up in his\r\nlikeness. If any American were trusted by his countrymen to delineate\r\nwhat they call their national character, it would infallibly come out a\r\nperfect likeness of Washington. But there is a mistake here. There were\r\ninfluences prior to Washington, and there are circumstances which have\r\nsurvived him, that cause some images to lie deeper down in the hearts of\r\nAmericans than Washington himself. His character is a grand and very\r\nprevalent idea among them: but there are others which take the\r\nprecedence, from being more general still. Wealth and opinion were\r\npractically worshipped before Washington opened his eyes on the sun\r\nwhich was to light him to his deeds; and the worship of Opinion is, at\r\nthis day, the established religion of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf the prevalent idea of society did not arise out of circumstances over\r\nwhich the mutations of outward events exercise but a small immediate\r\ninfluence, it is clear that, in this case, the idea should arise out of\r\nthe characters of the benefactors who achieved the revolution, and must\r\nbe consistent with the solemn words in which they conveyed their united\r\nDeclaration. The principles of truth, and the rule of justice, according\r\nto which that Declaration was framed, and that revolutionary struggle\r\nundertaken and conducted, should, but for prior influences, have been\r\nthe spirit inspiring the whole civilisation of the American people.\r\nThere should then have been the utmost social as well as political\r\nfreedom. The pursuit of wealth might then have been subordinated at\r\npleasure: fear of injury, alike from opinion and from violence, should\r\nhave been banished; and as noble facilities afforded for the progression\r\nof the inward, as for the enjoyment of the outward, man. But this was\r\nnot given. Instead of it there was ordained a mingling of old and new\r\ninfluences, from which a somewhat new kind of civilisation has arisen.\r\n\r\nThe old-world estimation of wealth has remained among them, though, I\r\nbelieve and trust, somewhat diminished in strength. Though every man\r\nworks for it in America, and not quite every man does so in England, it\r\nseems to me that it is not so absolutely the foreground object in all\r\nviews of life, the one subject of care, speculation, inquiry, and\r\nsupposition, that it is in England. It is in America clearly subordinate\r\nto another idea, still an idol, but of a higher order than the former.\r\nThe worship of Opinion certainly takes precedence of that of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn a country where the will of the majority decides all political\r\naffairs, there is a temptation to belong to the majority, except where\r\nstrong interests, or probabilities of the speedy supremacy of the\r\nminority, countervail. The minority, in such a case, must be possessed\r\nof a strong will, to be a minority. A strong will is dreaded by the\r\nweaker, who have so little faith as to believe that such a will\r\nendangers the political equality which is the fundamental principle of\r\ntheir institutions. This dread occasions persecution, or at least\r\nopprobrium: opprobrium becomes a real danger; and, like all dangers, is\r\nmuch more feared than it deserves, the longer it lasts, and the more it\r\nis dwelt upon. Thus, from a want of faith in the infallible operation of\r\nthe principles of truth and the rule of justice, these last become\r\n\"hollow words\" in the States of the new, as in the kingdoms of the old\r\nworld; and the infant nation, which was expected to begin a fresh and\r\nhigher social life, is acting out in its civilisation an idea but little\r\nmore exalted than those which have operated among nations far less\r\nfavoured than herself in regard to political freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIDEA OF HONOUR.\r\n\r\n     \"Talent and worth are the only eternal grounds of distinction. To\r\n     these the Almighty has affixed his everlasting patent of nobility;\r\n     and these it is which make the bright, 'the immortal names,' to\r\n     which our children may aspire, as well as others. It will be our\r\n     own fault if, in our own land, society as well as government is not\r\n     organised upon a new foundation.\"\r\n\r\n     _Miss Sedgwick._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is better to live for honour than for wealth: but how\r\nmuch better, depends upon the idea of honour. Where truth and justice\r\nare more than hollow words, the idea of honour is such as to exclude all\r\nfear, except of wrong-doing. Where the honour is to be derived from\r\npresent human opinion, there must be fear, ever present, and perpetually\r\nexciting to or withholding from action. In such a case, as painful a\r\nbondage is incurred as in the pursuit of wealth. If riches take to\r\nthemselves wings, and fly away, so does popularity. If rich freights are\r\nin danger afar off from storms, and harvests at home from blights, so is\r\nreputation, from differences of opinion, and varieties of views and\r\ntempers. If all that moralists have written, and wise men have\r\ntestified, about the vanity and misery of depending on human applause be\r\ntrue, there can be no true freedom in communities, any more than for\r\nindividuals, who live to opinion. The time will come when the Americans\r\nalso will testify to this, as a nation, as many individual members of\r\ntheir society have done already. The time will come when they will be\r\nastonished to discover how they mar their own privileges by allowing\r\nthemselves less liberty of speech and action than is enjoyed by the\r\ninhabitants of countries whose political servitude the Americans justly\r\ncompassionate and despise.\r\n\r\nThis regard to opinion shows itself under various forms in different\r\nparts of the country, and under dissimilar social arrangements. In the\r\nsouth, where the labour itself is capital, and labour cannot therefore\r\nbe regarded with due respect, there is much vanity of retinue, much\r\nextravagance, from fear of the imputation of poverty which would follow\r\nupon retrenchment; and great recklessness of life, from fear of the\r\nimputation of cowardice which might follow upon forgiveness of injuries.\r\nFear of imputation is here the panic, under which men relinquish their\r\nfreedom of action and speech. In the north, society has been enabled,\r\nchiefly by the religious influence which has descended from the fathers,\r\nto surmount, in some degree, this low kind of fear, so far as it shows\r\nitself in recklessness of life: but not altogether. I was amazed to hear\r\na gentleman of New England declare, while complaining of the insolence\r\nof the southern members of Congress to the northern, under shelter of\r\nthe northern men not being duellists, that, if he went to Congress, he\r\nwould give out that he would fight. I do not believe that he would\r\nactually have proved himself so far behind the society to which he\r\nbelonged as to have adopted a bad practice which it had\r\noutgrown,--adopted it from that very fear of imputation which he\r\ndespised in the south; but the impulse under which he spoke testified to\r\nthe danger of a fear of opinion taking any form, however low, when it\r\nexists under any other.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Philadelphia, a shocking incident happened in a family\r\nwith which I was acquainted. The only son, a fine youth of nineteen, was\r\ninsulted by a fellow-student. His father and uncle consulted what must\r\nbe done; and actually sent the young man out to fight the person who had\r\ninsulted him: the mother being aware of it, and praying that if either\r\nfell, it might be her son. She no doubt felt in her true heart, that it\r\nwould be better to die than to murder another from the selfish fear of\r\nimputation. The first aggressor lost a finger; and there, it was said,\r\nthe matter ended. But the matter has not ended yet, nor will end; for\r\nthe young man has had a lesson of low selfishness, of moral cowardice\r\nimpressed upon him by the guardians of his youth, with a force which he\r\nis not likely to surmount: and the society in which he lives has seen\r\nthe strongest testimony to false principles borne by two of its most\r\nrespected members.\r\n\r\nNot by any means as a fair specimen of society, but as an example of\r\nwhat kind of honour may be enjoyed where the fear of imputation is at\r\nits height, I give the description, as it was given me by a resident, of\r\nwhat a man may do in an eminently duelling portion of the southern\r\ncountry. \"A man may kill another, and be no worse. He may be shabby in\r\nhis money transactions, but may not steal. He may game, but not keep a\r\ngaming-house.\" It will not do for the duellists of the south to drop in\r\nconversation, as they do, that good manners can exist only where\r\nvengeance is the penalty of bad. The fear of imputation and the dread of\r\nvengeance are at least as contemptible as bad manners; and\r\nunquestionably lower than the fear of opinion prevalent in the north.\r\n\r\nIn the north there can be little vanity of retinue, as retinue is not\r\nto be had: but there is, instead of it, much ostentation of wealth, in\r\nthe commercial cities. It is here that the aristocracy form and collect;\r\nand, as has been before said, the aristocratic is universally the\r\nfearing, while the democratic is the hoping, party. The fear of opinion\r\ntakes many forms. There is fear of vulgarity, fear of responsibility;\r\nand above all, fear of singularity. There is something more displeasing,\r\nat the first view, in the caution of the Yankees than in the\r\nrecklessness of the cavalier race of the south. Till the individual\r\nexceptions come out from the mass; till the domestic frankness and\r\ngenerosity of the whole people are apparent, there is something little\r\nshort of disgusting to the stranger who has been unused to witness such\r\nwant of social confidence, in the caution which presents probably the\r\nstrongest aspect of selfishness that he has ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe Americans of the northern States are, from education and habit, so\r\naccustomed to the caution of which I speak, as to be unaware of its\r\nextent and singularity. They think themselves injured by the remarks\r\nwhich strangers make upon it, and by the ridicule with which it is\r\ntreated by their own countrymen who have travelled abroad. But the\r\nsingularity is in themselves. They may travel over the world, and find\r\nno society but their own which will submit to the restraint of perpetual\r\ncaution, and reference to the opinions of others. They may travel over\r\nthe whole world, and find no country but their own where the very\r\nchildren beware of getting into scrapes, and talk of the effect of\r\nactions upon people's minds; where the youth of society determine in\r\nsilence what opinions they shall bring forward, and what avow only in\r\nthe family circle; where women write miserable letters, almost\r\nuniversally, because it is a settled matter that it is unsafe to commit\r\noneself on paper; and where elderly people seem to lack almost\r\nuniversally that faith in principles which inspires a free expression of\r\nthem at any time, and under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. B.,\" said a child of eleven to a friend of mine, \"what church do\r\nyou go to?\"--\"To Mr. ----'s.\" \"O, Mrs. B. are you a Unitarian?\"--\"No.\"\r\n\"Then why do you go to that church?\"--\"Because I can worship best\r\nthere.\" \"O, but Mrs. B., think of the example,--the example, Mrs. B.!\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in the country some time, I remarked to one who knew\r\nwell the society in which he lived, that I had not seen a good lady's\r\nletter since I landed; though the conversation of some of the writers\r\nwas of a very superior kind. The letters were uniformly poor and guarded\r\nin expression, confined to common-places, and overloaded with flattery.\r\n\"There are,\" replied he, \"no good letters written in America. The force\r\nof public opinion is so strong, and the danger of publicity so great,\r\nthat men do not write what they think, for fear of getting into bad\r\nhands: and this acts again upon the women, and makes their style\r\nartificial.\" It is not quite true that there are no good letters written\r\nin America: among my own circle of correspondents there, there are\r\nladies and gentlemen whose letters would stand a comparison with any for\r\nfrankness, grace, and epistolary beauty of every kind. But I am not\r\naware of any medium between this excellence and the boarding-school\r\ninsignificance which characterises the rest.\r\n\r\nWhen the stranger has recovered a little from the first disagreeable\r\nimpression of all this caution, he naturally asks what there can be to\r\nrender it worth while. To this question, I never could discover a\r\nsatisfactory answer. What harm the \"force of public opinion,\" or\r\n\"publicity,\" can do to any individual; what injury \"bad hands\" can\r\ninflict upon a good man or woman, which can be compared with the evil of\r\nliving in perpetual caution, I cannot imagine. If men and women cannot\r\nbear blame, they had better hew out a space for themselves in the\r\nforest, and live there, as the only safe place. If they are afraid of\r\nobservation and comment, they should withdraw from society altogether:\r\nfor the interest which human beings take in each other is so deep and\r\nuniversal, that observation and comment are unavoidable wherever there\r\nare eyes to see, and hearts and minds to yearn and speculate. An honest\r\nman will not naturally fear this investigation. If he is not sure of his\r\nopinions on any matter, he will say so, and endeavour to gain light. If\r\nhe is sure, he will speak them, and be ready to avow the grounds of\r\nthem, as occasion arises. That there should be some who think his\r\nopinions false and dangerous is not pleasant; but it is an evil too\r\ntrifling to be mentioned in comparison with the bondage of concealment,\r\nand the torment of fear. This bondage, this torment is worse than the\r\nworst that the \"force of public opinion\" can inflict, even if such force\r\nshould close the prospect of political advancement, of professional\r\neminence, and of the best of social privileges. There are some members\r\nof society in America who have found persecution, excommunication, and\r\nviolence, more endurable than the concealment of their convictions.\r\n\r\nFew persons really doubt this when the plain case is set down before\r\nthem. They agree to it in church on Sundays, and in conversation by the\r\nfireside: and the reason why they are so backward as they are to act\r\nupon it in the world, is that habit and education are too strong for\r\nthem. They have worn their chains so long that they feel them less than\r\nmight be supposed. I doubt whether they can even conceive of a state of\r\nsociety, of its ease and comfort, where no man fears his neighbour, and\r\nit is no evil to be responsible for one's opinions: where men, knowing\r\nhow undiscernible consequences are, and how harmless they must be to the\r\nupright, abide them without fear, and do not perplex themselves with\r\ncalculating what is incalculable. Whenever the time shall come for the\r\nAmericans to discover all this, to perceive how miserable a restraint\r\nthey have imposed upon themselves by this servitude to opinion, they\r\nwill see how it is that, while outwardly blessed beyond all parallel,\r\nthey have been no happier than the rest of the world. I doubt whether,\r\namong the large \"uneasy classes\" of the Old World, there is so much\r\nheart-eating care, so much nervous anxiety, as among the dwellers in the\r\ntowns of the northern States of America, from this cause alone. If I had\r\nto choose, I would rather endure the involuntary uneasiness of the Old\r\nWorld sufferers, than the self-imposed anxiety of those of the New:\r\nexcept that the self-imposed suffering may be shaken off at any moment.\r\nThere are instances, few, but striking, of strong-minded persons who\r\nhave discovered and are practising the true philosophy of ease; who have\r\nopenly taken their stand upon principles, and are prepared for all\r\nconsequences, meekly and cheerfully defying all possible inflictions of\r\nopinion. Though it does not enter into their calculations, such may\r\npossibly find that they are enjoying more, and suffering less from\r\nopinion, than those who most daintily court it.\r\n\r\nThere would be something amusing in observing the operation of this\r\nhabit of caution, if it were not too serious a misfortune. When Dr.\r\nChanning's work on Slavery came out, the following conversation passed\r\nbetween a lady of Boston and myself. She began it with--\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Dr. Channing's book?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no. Do not you think it very ill-timed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I think it well-timed; as it did not come out sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it not wrong to increase the public excitement at such a time?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon the nature of the excitement. But this book seems to\r\nhave a tranquillising effect: as the exhibition of true principles\r\ngenerally has.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Dr. Channing is not a practical man. He is only a retired student.\r\nHe has no real interest in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No worldly interest; and this, and his seclusion, enable him to see\r\nmore clearly than others, in a case where principles enlighten men, and\r\npractice seems only to blind them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well: I shall certainly read the book, as you like it so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't, if that is your reason.\"\r\n\r\nA reply to Dr. Channing's book soon appeared;--a pamphlet which savoured\r\nonly of fear, dollars, and, consequently, insult. A gentleman of Boston,\r\nwho had, on some important occasions, shown that he could exercise a\r\nhigh moral courage, made no mention of this reply for some time after it\r\nappeared. At length, on hearing another person speak of it as it\r\ndeserved, he said, \"Now people are so openly speaking of that reply, I\r\nhave no objection to say what I think of it. I have held my tongue about\r\nit hitherto; but yesterday I heard ---- speak of it as you do; and I no\r\nlonger hesitate to declare that I think it an infamous production.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such are remarkable cases. Be it so: they still\r\ntestify to the habit of society, by the direction which the caution\r\ntakes. Elsewhere, the parties might be quite as much afraid of\r\nsomething else; but they would not dream of refraining from a good book,\r\nor holding their tongues about the badness of a vicious pamphlet, till\r\nsupported by the opinions of others.\r\n\r\nHow strong a contrast to all this the domestic life of the Americans\r\npresents will appear when I come to speak of the spirit of intercourse.\r\nIt is an individual, though prevalent, selfishness that I have now been\r\nlamenting.\r\n\r\nThe traveller should go into the west when he desires to see universal\r\nfreedom of manners. The people of the west have a comfortable\r\nself-complacency, equally different from the arrogance of the south, and\r\nthe timidity of the north. They seem to unite with this the hospitality\r\nwhich distinguishes the whole country: so that they are, on the whole, a\r\nvery bewitching people. Their self-confidence probably arises from their\r\nbeing really remarkably energetic, and having testified this by the\r\nconquests over nature which their mere settlement in the west evinces.\r\nThey are the freest people I saw in America: and accordingly one enjoys\r\namong them a delightful exemption from the sorrow and indignation which\r\nworldly caution always inspires; and from flattery. If the stranger\r\nfinds himself flattered in the west, he may pretty safely conclude that\r\nthe person he is talking with comes from New England. \"We are apt to\r\nthink,\" said a westerner to me, \"that however great and good another\r\nperson may be, we are just as great and good.\" Accordingly, intercourse\r\ngoes on without any reference whatever to the merits of the respective\r\nparties. In the sunshine of complacency, their free thoughts ripen into\r\nfree deeds, and the world gains largely. There are, naturally, instances\r\nof extreme conceit, here and there: but I do not hesitate to avow that,\r\nprevalent as mock-modesty and moral cowardice are in the present\r\ncondition of society, that degree of self-confidence which is commonly\r\ncalled conceit grows in favour with me perpetually. An over-estimate of\r\nself appears to me a far less hurtful and disagreeable mistake than the\r\nidolatry of opinion. It is a mistake which is sure to be rectified,\r\nsooner or later; and very often, it proves to be no mistake where small\r\ncritics feel the most confident that they may safely ridicule it. The\r\nevent decides this matter of self-estimate, beyond all question; and\r\nwhile the event remains undisclosed, it is easy and pleasant to give men\r\ncredit for as much as they believe themselves to be capable of:--more\r\neasy and pleasant than to see men restricting their own powers by such\r\ncalculation of consequences as implies an equal want of faith in others\r\nand in themselves. If John Milton were now here to avow his hope that he\r\nshould produce that which \"the world would not willingly let die,\" what\r\na shout there would be of \"the conceited fellow!\" while, the declaration\r\nhaving been made venerable by the event, it is now cited as an instance\r\nof the noble self-confidence of genius.\r\n\r\nThe people of the west have a right to so much self-confidence as arises\r\nfrom an ascertainment of what they can actually achieve. They come from\r\nafar, with some qualities which have force enough to guide them into a\r\nnew region. They subdue this region to their own purposes; and, if they\r\ndo often forget that the world elsewhere is progressing; if they do\r\nsuppose themselves as relatively great in present society as they were\r\nformerly in the wilderness, it should be remembered, on their behalf,\r\nthat they have effectually asserted their manhood in the conquest of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIf we are not yet to see, except in individual instances, the exquisite\r\nunion of fearlessness with modesty, of self-confidence with\r\nmeekness;--if there must be either the love of being grand in one's own\r\neyes, or the fear of being little in other people's,--the friends of the\r\nAmericans would wish that their error should be that which is allied to\r\ntoo much, rather than too little freedom.\r\n\r\nAs for the anxiety about foreign opinions of America, I found it less\r\nstriking than I expected. In the south, there is the keenest sensibility\r\nto the opinion of the world about slavery; and in New England, the\r\nveneration for England is greater than I think any one people ought to\r\nfeel for any other. The love of the mother country, the filial pride in\r\nher ancient sages, are natural and honourable: and so, perhaps, is a\r\nsomewhat exalted degree of deference for the existing dwellers upon the\r\nsoil of that mother country, and on the spot where those sages lived and\r\nthought and spoke. But, as long as no civilised nation is, or can be\r\nascertained to be, far superior or inferior to any other; as the human\r\nheart and human life are generally alike and equal, on this side\r\nbarbarism, the excessive reverence with which England is regarded by the\r\nAmericans seems to imply a deficiency of self-respect. This is an\r\nimmeasurably higher and more healthy state of feeling than that which\r\nhas been exhibited by a small portion of the English towards the\r\nAmericans;--the contempt which, again, a sprinkling of Americans have\r\nstriven to reciprocate. But the despisers in each nation, though so\r\nnoisy as to produce some effect, are so few as to need no more than a\r\npassing allusion. If any English person can really see and know the\r\nAmericans on their own ground, and fail to honour them as a nation, and\r\nlove them as personal friends, he is no fair sample of the people whose\r\nname he bears; and is probably incapable of unperverted reverence: and\r\nif any American, having really seen and known the English on their own\r\nground, does not reverence his own home exactly in proportion as he\r\nloves what is best in the English, he is unworthy of his home.\r\n\r\nWhen I was on my voyage out, the Americans on board amused themselves\r\nwith describing to me how incessantly I should be met by the question\r\nhow I liked America. When we arrived within a few miles of New York, a\r\nsteam-boat met us, bringing the friends of some of the passengers. On\r\nboard this steam-boat, the passengers went up to the city. It happened\r\nto be the smallest, dirtiest, and most clumsy steamer belonging to the\r\nport. A splashing rain drove us down into the cabin, where there was\r\nbarely standing room for our company. We saw each other's faces by the\r\ndim light of a single shabby lamp. \"Now, Miss M.\" said some of the\r\nAmerican passengers, \"how do you like America?\" This was the first time\r\nof my being asked the question which I have had to answer almost daily\r\nsince. Yet I do not believe that many of my interrogators seriously\r\ncared any more for my answer than those who first put the question in\r\nthe dirty cabin; or than my little friend Charley, who soon caught the\r\njoke, and with grave face, asked me, every now and then, \"How do you\r\nlike this country?\" I learned to regard it as a method of beginning\r\nconversation, like our meteorological observations in England; which are\r\nequally amusing to foreigners. My own impression is, that while the\r\nAmericans have too exalted a notion of England, and too little\r\nself-respect as a nation, they are far less anxious about foreign\r\nopinions of themselves than the behaviour of American travellers in\r\nEngland would lead the English to suppose. The anxiety arises on English\r\nground. At home, the generality of Americans seem to see clearly enough\r\nthat it is yet truer with regard to nations than individuals that,\r\nthough it is very pleasant to have the favourable opinion of one's\r\nneighbours, yet, if one is good and happy within oneself, the rest does\r\nnot much matter. I met with a few who spoke with a disgusting\r\naffectation of candour, (some, as if they expected to please me thereby,\r\nand others under the influence of sectional prejudice,) of what they\r\ncalled the fairness of the gross slanders with which they have been\r\ninsulted through the English press: but I was thankful to meet with more\r\nwho did not acknowledge the jurisdiction of observers disqualified by\r\nprejudice, or by something worse, for passing judgment on a nation. The\r\nirritability of their vanity has been much exaggerated, partly to serve\r\npaltry purposes of authorship; and yet more from the ridiculous\r\nexhibitions of some Americans in England, who are no more to be taken as\r\nspecimens of the nation to which they belong than a young Englishman\r\nwho, when I was at New York, went up the Hudson in a drizzling rain,\r\npronounced that West Point was not so pretty as Richmond; descended the\r\nriver in the dark, and declared on his return that the Americans were\r\nwonderfully proud of scenery that was nothing particular in any way.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for the Americans, particularly those of the east and\r\nsouth, when their idea of honour becomes as exalted as that which\r\ninspired their revolutionary ancestors. Whenever they possess themselves\r\nof the idea of their democracy, as it was possessed by their statesmen\r\nof 1801, they will moderate their homage of human opinion, and enhance\r\ntheir worship of humanity. Not till then will they live up to their\r\ninstitutions, and enjoy that internal freedom and peace to which the\r\nexternal are but a part of the means. In such improvement, they will be\r\nmuch assisted by the increasing intercourse between Britain and America;\r\nfor, however fascinating to Americans may be the luxury, conversational\r\nfreedom, and high intellectual cultivation of some portions of English\r\nsociety, they cannot fail to be disgusted with the aristocratic\r\ninsolence which is the vice of the whole. The puerile and barbaric\r\nspirit of contempt is scarcely known in America: the English insolence\r\nof class to class, of individuals towards each other, is not even\r\nconceived of, except in the one highly disgraceful instance of the\r\ntreatment of the people of colour. Nothing in American civilisation\r\nstruck me so forcibly and so pleasurably as the invariable respect paid\r\nto man, as man. Nothing since my return to England has given me so much\r\npain as the contrast there. Perhaps no Englishman can become fully\r\naware, without going to America, of the atmosphere of insolence in which\r\nhe dwells; of the taint of contempt which infects all the intercourses\r\nof his world. He cannot imagine how all that he can say that is truest\r\nand best about the treatment of people of colour in America is\r\nneutralised on the spot, by its being understood how the same contempt\r\nis spread over the whole of society here, which is there concentrated\r\nupon the blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nCASTE.\r\n\r\nThis word, at least its meaning, is no more likely to become obsolete in\r\na republic than among the Hindoos themselves. The distinctive\r\ncharacteristics may vary; but there will be rank, and tenacity of rank,\r\nwherever there is society. As this is natural, inevitable, it is of\r\ncourse right. The question must be what is to entitle to rank.\r\n\r\nAs the feudal qualifications for rank are absolutely non-existent in\r\nAmerica, (except in the slave States, where there are two classes,\r\nwithout any minor distinctions,) it seems absurd that the feudal remains\r\nof rank in Europe should be imitated in America. Wherever the appearance\r\nof a conventional aristocracy exists in America, it must arise from\r\nwealth, as it cannot from birth. An aristocracy of mere wealth is vulgar\r\neverywhere. In a republic, it is vulgar in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThis is the only kind of vulgarity I saw in the United States. I imagine\r\nthat the English who have complained the most copiously of the vulgarity\r\nof American manners, have done so from two causes: from using their own\r\nconventional notions as a standard of manners, (which is a vulgarism in\r\nthemselves;) and also from their intercourses with the Americans having\r\nbeen confined to those who consider themselves the aristocracy of the\r\nUnited States; the wealthy and showy citizens of the Atlantic ports.\r\nForeign travellers are most hospitably received by this class of\r\nsociety; introduced to \"the first people in Boston,\"--\"in New\r\nYork,\"--\"in Philadelphia;\" and taught to view the country with the eyes\r\nof their hosts. No harm is intended here: it is very natural: but it is\r\nnot the way for strangers to obtain an understanding of the country and\r\nthe people. The traveller who chooses industriously to see for himself,\r\nnot with European or aristocratic merely, but with human eyes, will find\r\nthe real aristocracy of the country, not only in ball-rooms and\r\nbank-parlours, but also in fishing-boats, in stores, in college\r\nchambers, and behind the plough. Till he has seen all this, and studied\r\nthe natural manners of the natural aristocracy, he is no more justified\r\nin applying the word \"vulgar\" to more than a class, than an American\r\nwould be who should call all the English vulgar, when he had seen only\r\nthe London alderman class.\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity of perceiving what errors might arise from this\r\ncause. I was told a great deal about \"the first people in Boston:\" which\r\nis perhaps as aristocratic, vain, and vulgar a city, as described by its\r\nown \"first people,\" as any in the world. Happily, however, Boston has\r\nmerits which these people know not of. I am far from thinking it, as\r\nthey do, the most religious, the most enlightened, and the most virtuous\r\ncity in the world. There are other cities in the United States which, on\r\nthe whole, I think more virtuous and more enlightened: but I certainly\r\nam not aware of so large a number of peculiarly interesting and valuable\r\npersons living in near neighbourhood, anywhere else but in London. But\r\nit happens that these persons belong chiefly to the natural, very few to\r\nthe conventional, aristocracy. They have little perceptible influence.\r\nSociety does not seem to be much the better for them. They save their\r\nown souls; but, as regards society, the salt appears to have lost its\r\nsavour. It is so sprinkled as not to season the body. With men and women\r\nenough on the spot to redeem society from false morals, and empty\r\nreligious profession, Boston is the head-quarters of Cant.\r\nNotwithstanding its superior intelligence, its large provision of\r\nbenevolent institutions, and its liberal hospitality, there is an\r\nextraordinary and most pernicious union, in more than a few scattered\r\ninstances, of profligacy and the worst kind of infidelity, with a strict\r\nreligious profession, and an outward demeanour of remarkable propriety.\r\nThe profligacy and infidelity might, I fear, be found in all other\r\ncities, on both sides the water; but nowhere, probably, in absolute\r\nco-existence with ostensible piety. This is not the connexion in which\r\nto speak of the religious aspect of the matter; but, as regards the\r\ncant, I believe that it proceeds chiefly from the spirit of caste which\r\nflourishes in a society which on Sundays and holidays professes to have\r\nabjured it. It is true that the people of New England have put away\r\nduelling; but the feelings which used to vent themselves by the practice\r\nof duelling are cherished by the members of the conventional\r\naristocracy. This is revealed, not only by the presence of cant, but by\r\nthe confessions of some who are bold enough not to pretend to be either\r\nrepublicans or christians. There are some few who openly desire a\r\nmonarchy; and a few more who constantly insinuate the advantages of a\r\nmonarchy, and the distastefulness of a republic. It is observable that\r\nsuch always argue on the supposition that if there were a monarchy, they\r\nshould be the aristocracy: a point in which I imagine they would find\r\nthemselves mistaken, if so impossible an event could happen at all. This\r\nclass, or coterie, is a very small one, and not influential; though a\r\ngentleman of the kind once ventured to give utterance to his aspirations\r\nafter monarchy in a fourth of July oration; and afterwards to print\r\nthem. There is something venerable in his intrepidity, at least. The\r\nreproach of cant does not attach to him.\r\n\r\nThe children are such faithful reflectors of this spirit as to leave no\r\ndoubt of its existence, even amidst the nicest operations of cant.\r\nGentlemen may disguise their aristocratic aspirations under sighs for\r\nthe depressed state of literature and science; supposing that wealth and\r\nleisure are the constituents of literature; and station the proximate\r\ncause of science; and committing the slight mistake of assuming that the\r\nnatural aristocracy of England, her philosophers and poets, have been\r\nidentical with, or originated by, her conventional aristocracy. The\r\nladies may conceal their selfish pride of caste, even from themselves,\r\nunder pretensions to superior delicacy and refinement. But the children\r\nuse no such disguises. Out they come with what they learn at home. A\r\nschool-girl told me what a delightful \"set\" she belonged to at her\r\nschool: how comfortable they all were once, without any sets, till\r\nseveral grocers' daughters began to come in, as their fathers grew rich;\r\nand it became necessary for the higher girls to consider what they\r\nshould do, and to form themselves into sets. She told me how the\r\ndaughter of a lottery office-keeper came to the school; and no set would\r\nreceive her; how unkindly she was treated, and how difficult it was for\r\nany individual to help her, because she had not spirit or temper enough\r\nto help herself. My informant went on to mention how anxious she and her\r\nset, of about sixty young people, were to visit exclusively among\r\nthemselves, how \"delightful\" it would be to have no grocers' daughters\r\namong them; but that it was found to be impossible.\r\n\r\nHere is an education to be going on in the middle of a republic! Much\r\nsolace, however, lies in the last clause of the information above\r\nquoted. The Exclusives do find their aims 'impossible.' They will\r\nneither have a monarchy, nor be able to complete and close their 'sets:'\r\nleast of all will any republican functions be discharged by those who\r\nare brought up to have any respect of occupations,--to regard a grocer\r\nas beneath a banker. The chief effect of the aristocratic spirit in a\r\ndemocracy is to make those who are possessed by it exclusives in a\r\ndouble sense; in being excluded yet more than in excluding. The republic\r\nsuffers no further than by having within it a small class acting upon\r\nanti-republican morals, and becoming thereby its perverse children,\r\ninstead of its wise and useful friends and servants.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia, I was much in society. Some of my hospitable\r\nacquaintances lived in Chesnut Street, some in Arch Street, and many in\r\nother places. When I had been a few weeks in the city, I found to my\r\nsurprise that some of the ladies who were my admiration had not only\r\nnever seen or heard of other beautiful young ladies whom I admired quite\r\nas much, but never would see or hear of them. I inquired again and again\r\nfor a solution of this mystery. One person told me that a stranger could\r\nnot see into the usages of their society. This was just what I was\r\nfeeling to be true; but it gave me no satisfaction. Another said that\r\nthe mutual ignorance was from the fathers of the Arch Street ladies\r\nhaving made their fortunes, while the Chesnut Street ladies owed theirs\r\nto their grandfathers. Another, who was amused with a new fashion of\r\ncurtseying, just introduced, declared it was from the Arch Street ladies\r\nrising twice on their toes before curtseying, while the Chesnut Street\r\nladies rose thrice. I was sure of only one thing in the matter; that it\r\nwas a pity that the parties should lose the pleasure of admiring each\r\nother, for no better reasons than these: and none better were apparent.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the mere circumstance of living in a\r\nrepublic will ever eradicate that kind of self-love which takes the form\r\nof family pride. It is a stage in the transit from selfishness to\r\nbenevolence; and therefore natural and useful in its proper time and\r\nplace. As every child thinks his father the wisest man in the world, the\r\nloving member of a family thinks his relations the greatest, best and\r\nhappiest of people, till he gets an intimate knowledge of some others.\r\nThis species of exclusiveness exists wherever there are families. An\r\neminent public man, travelling in a somewhat retired part of his State,\r\ntold us how he had been amused with an odd instance of family pride\r\nwhich had just come under his notice. Some plain farmers, brothers, had\r\nclaimed to be his cousins; and he found they were so. They introduced\r\neach other to him; and one brought his son,--a hideous little\r\nFlibbertigibbet, with a shock of carroty hair. His father complacently\r\nstroked his hair, and declared he was exactly like his uncle Richard:\r\nhis uncle Richard over again; 'twas wonderful how like his uncle Richard\r\nhe was in all respects: the hair was the very same; and his uncle\r\nRichard was dumb till very late, and then stammered: \"and this little\r\nfellow,\" said the father, with a complacent smile,--\"this little fellow\r\nis six years old, and he can't speak a word.\"\r\n\r\nNo one will find fault with the pride of connexion in this stage.\r\nSupposing it to remain in its present state, it is harmless from its\r\nextreme smallness. In a city, under the stimulus of society, the same\r\npride may be either perverted into the spirit of caste, or exalted into\r\nthe affection of pure republican brotherhood. The alternative is\r\nsignificant as to the state of the republic, and all-important to the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe extent and influence of the conventional aristocracy in the United\r\nStates are significant of the state of the republic so far as that they\r\nafford an accurate measure of the anti-republican spirit which exists.\r\nSuch an aristocracy must remain otherwise too insignificant to be\r\ndangerous. It cannot choose its own members, restrict its own numbers,\r\nor keep its gentility from contamination; for it must be perpetuated,\r\nnot by hereditary transmission, but by accessions from below. Grocers\r\ngrow rich, and mechanics become governors of States; and happily there\r\nis no law, nor reason, nor desire that it should be otherwise. This\r\nlittle cloud will always overhang the republic, like the perpetual\r\nvapour which hovers above Niagara, thrown up by the force and regularity\r\nof the movement below. Some observers may be sorry that the heaven is\r\nnever to be quite clear: but none will dread the little cloud. It would\r\nbe about as reasonable to fear that the white vapour should drown the\r\ncataract from whence it issues as that the conventional aristocracy of\r\nAmerica should swamp the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY.\r\n\r\nI found it an admitted truth, throughout the United States, that\r\nenormous private wealth is inconsistent with the spirit of\r\nrepublicanism. Wealth is power; and large amounts of power ought not to\r\nrest in the hands of individuals.\r\n\r\nAdmitted truths are not complained of as hardships. I never met with any\r\none who quarrelled with public opinion for its enmity to large fortunes:\r\non the contrary, every one who spoke with me on the subject was of the\r\nsame mind with everybody else. Amidst the prevalent desire of gain,\r\nagainst which divines are preaching, and moralists are writing in vain,\r\nthere seems to be no desire to go beyond what public opinion approves.\r\nThe desire of riches merges in a regard to opinion. There is more of the\r\nspirit of competition and of ostentation in it, than desire of\r\naccumulation. It has been mentioned that there are not more than four or\r\nfive hundred affluent men,--worth 100,000 dollars and upwards,--in all\r\nthe six States of New England; in a population of above two millions.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling is so strong against transmitting large estates, and\r\nfavouring one child, that nobody attempts to do it. The rare endeavours\r\nmade by persons of feudal prepossessions to perpetuate this vicious\r\ncustom, have been all happily frustrated. Much ridicule was occasioned\r\nby the manoeuvres of one such testator, who provided for the portions of\r\na large estate reverting periodically; forgetting that the reversions\r\nwere as saleable as anything else; and that, under a democracy, there\r\ncan be no settling the private, any more than the public, affairs of\r\nfuture generations. The present Patroon of Albany, the story of whose\r\nhereditary wealth is universally known, intends to divide his property\r\namong his children,--in number, I believe, thirteen. Under him has\r\nprobably expired the practice of favouring one child for the\r\npreservation of a large estate.\r\n\r\nThis remote approach to an equalisation of property is, as far as it\r\ngoes, an improvement upon the state of affairs in the Old World, where\r\nthe accumulation of wealth into masses, the consequent destitution of\r\nlarge portions of society, and the divisions which thus are established\r\nbetween class and class, between man and man, constitute a system too\r\nabsurd and too barbarous to endure. The remote approach made by the\r\nAmericans to an equalisation of wealth is yet more important as\r\nindicating the method by which society is to be eventually redeemed from\r\nits absurdity and barbarism in respect of property. This method is as\r\nyet perceived by only a few: but the many who imitate as far as they can\r\nthe modes of the Old World, and cherish to the utmost its feudal\r\nprepossessions, will only for a time be able to resist the convictions\r\nwhich the working of republican principles will force upon them, that\r\nthere is no way of securing perfect social liberty on democratic\r\nprinciples but by community of property.\r\n\r\nThere is, as there ought to be, as great a horror in America as\r\neverywhere else of the despotism that would equalise property\r\narbitrarily. Such a despotism can never become more than the ghost of a\r\nfancy. The approach to equalisation now required by public opinion is\r\nthat required by justice; it is required that no man should encroach on\r\nhis neighbours for the sake of enriching himself; that no man should\r\nencroach on his younger children for the sake of enriching the eldest;\r\nthat no man should encroach on the present generation for the sake of\r\nenriching a future one. All this is allowed and required. But by the\r\nsame rule, and for the sake of the same principle, no one will ever be\r\nallowed to take from the industrious man the riches won by his industry,\r\nand give them to the idle: to take from the strong to give to the weak:\r\nto take from the wise to give to the foolish. Such aggression upon\r\nproperty can never take place, or be seriously apprehended in a republic\r\nwhere all, except drunkards and slaves, are proprietors, and where the\r\nDeclaration of Independence claims for every one, with life and liberty,\r\nthe pursuit of happiness in his own way. There will be no attacks on\r\nproperty in the United States.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to me inevitable that there will be a general agreement,\r\nsooner or later, on a better principle of property than that under which\r\nall are restless; under which the wisdom and peace of the community fall\r\nfar below what their other circumstances would lead themselves and their\r\nwell-wishers to anticipate.\r\n\r\nTheir moralists are dissatisfied. \"Our present civilisation,\" says Dr.\r\nChanning, \"is characterised and tainted by a devouring greediness of\r\nwealth; and a cause which asserts right against wealth, must stir up\r\nbitter opposition, especially in cities where this divinity is most\r\nadored.\" ... \"The passion for gain is everywhere sapping pure and\r\ngenerous feeling, and everywhere raises up bitter foes against any\r\nreform which may threaten to turn aside a stream of wealth. I sometimes\r\nfeel as if a great social revolution were necessary to break up our\r\npresent mercenary civilisation, in order that Christianity, now repelled\r\nby the almost universal worldliness, may come into new contact with the\r\nsoul, and may reconstruct society after its own pure and disinterested\r\nprinciples.\"[20] This is a prophecy. Men to whom truth and justice are\r\nnot \"hollow words\" are the prophets of the times to come.\r\n\r\nThe scholars of America are dissatisfied. They complain of the\r\nsuperficial character of scholarship; of the depression, or rather of\r\nthe non-existence, of literature. Some hope that matters will be better\r\nhereafter, merely from the nation having grown older. The greater number\r\nascribe the mischief to men having to work at their employments; and\r\nsome few of these believe that America would have a literature if only\r\nshe had a hereditary aristocracy; this being supposed the only method of\r\nleaving to individuals the leisure and freedom of spirit necessary for\r\nliterary pursuits. It has been pointed out that this is a mistake.\r\nNature and social economy do not so agree as that genius is usually\r\ngiven to those who have hereditary wealth. The capability has so much\r\nmore frequently shown itself among the busy and poor than among the rich\r\nwho have leisure, as to mock the human presumption which would dictate\r\nfrom whose lips the oracles of Heaven should issue. One needs but to\r\nglance over the array of geniuses, of philosophers, of scientific men,\r\nand even of the far lower order of scholars, to see how few of the best\r\nbenefactors of mankind have issued from \"classic shades,\" \"learned\r\nleisure,\" \"scientific retreats,\" &c., and how many more have sent up\r\ntheir axioms, their song, their prophecy, their hallelujah, from the\r\nvery press of the toiling multitude. What tale is commoner than the\r\npoverty of poets; the need that philosophers have usually had of\r\nphilosophy; the embarrassments and destitution of inventors; the straits\r\nof scholars? The history of society shows that the highest intellect is\r\nno more to be looked for especially amidst opulent leisure, than the\r\nhighest devotion in the cloister. The divine breath of genius bloweth\r\nwhere it listeth. Men may hold out empty bags for it for ages, and not\r\ncatch it; while it fans the temples of some maimed soldier, toiling in\r\nchains as an Algerine slave, or some rustic, treading\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \"In glory and in joy,\r\n     Behind his plough, upon the mountain side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clearly a mistake that hereditary property, opportunity, leisure,\r\nand such things, will make a literature, or secure scholarship: as great\r\na, mistake as that of the American newspaper editor who triumphantly\r\nanticipated an age of statuary from there being an arrival at New York\r\nof a statue by Canova, at the same time with a discovery of marble\r\nquarries. It is true that the statue lies in the marble quarry: but it\r\nis also true that it lies sepulchred in the far deeper recesses of some\r\none unfathomable human intellect: and to bring the one right intellect\r\nto the quarry is the problem which is not given to be solved by mortal\r\nskill,--by devices of hereditary ease and scientific retreats. This kind\r\nof guidance is just that which the supreme Artist does not confide to\r\ncreated hands.\r\n\r\nIt is true, however, that though opportunity and leisure are not\r\neverything; that without union with useful toil, they are nothing,--yet,\r\nwith this union they are something,--much. The first attempt to advocate\r\nleisure as the birthright of every human being was made now some\r\nhalf-century ago.[21] The plea then advanced is a sound one on behalf of\r\nother things besides philosophy, literature and scholarship. Leisure,\r\nsome degree of it, is necessary to the health of every man's spirit. Not\r\nonly intellectual production, but peace of mind cannot flourish without\r\nit. It may be had under the present system, but it is not. With\r\ncommunity of property, it would be secured to every one. The requisite\r\namount of work would bear a very small proportion to that of disposable\r\ntime. It would then be fairly seen how much literature may owe to\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nThe professional men of America are dissatisfied. The best of them\r\ncomplain that professions rank lower than in Europe; and the reasons\r\nthey assign for this are, that less education is required; and that\r\nevery man who desires to get on must make himself a party man, in\r\ntheology, science, or law. Professional service is not well paid in the\r\nUnited States, compared with other countries, and with other occupations\r\non the spot. Very severe toil is necessary to maintain a respectable\r\nappearance, except to those who have climbed the heights of their\r\nprofession; and to them it has been necessary. One of these last, a man\r\nwhom the world supposes to be blessed in all conceivable respects, told\r\nme that he had followed a mistaken plan of life; and that if he could\r\nbegin again, he would spend his life differently. He had chosen his\r\noccupation rightly enough, and been wholly satisfied with his domestic\r\nlot: but his life had been one of toil and care in the pursuit of what\r\nhe now found would have done all it could for him in half the quantity.\r\nIf he could set himself back twenty years, he would seek far less\r\ndiligently for money and eminence, stipulate for leisure, and cultivate\r\nmirth. Though this gentleman cares for money only that he may have it to\r\ngive away; though his generosity of spirit is the most remarkable\r\nfeature of his character, he would gladly exchange the means of\r\ngratifying his liberal affections, for more capacity for mirth, more\r\nrepose of spirit. The present mercenary and competitive system does not\r\nsuit him.\r\n\r\nI know of one professional man who has found this repose of spirit by\r\nretiring from the competitive system, and devoting himself to an object\r\nin which there was, when he entered upon it, but too little competition.\r\nHe had, some time ago, earned a competence for himself and his family. A\r\nfriend who visited him on his estate made some inquiries about\r\ninvestments in the region where his host lived. \"I am the worst person\r\nyou could ask,\" replied the host: \"I know nothing about investments\r\nhere. We are very happy with the money we have; and we do not know that\r\nwe should be so happy if we had more: so I do not put myself in the way\r\nof hearing about profitable investments.\" He has most profitably\r\ninvested his time and energy in the anti-slavery cause. He has been\r\nperhaps the most eminent defender of the liberty of speech and of the\r\npress in the United States; and is setting an example, not only to his\r\nown children, but to the whole country, of what it is to follow after\r\nlife itself, instead of the mere means of living.\r\n\r\nThe merchants are dissatisfied. If money, if success, apart from the\r\nobject, could give happiness, who would be so happy as the merchants of\r\nAmerica? In comparison with merchants generally, they are happy: but in\r\ncomparison with what men are made to be, they are shackled, careworn,\r\nand weary as the slave. I obtained many a glimpse into the condition of\r\nmind of this class; and, far superior as it is to what the state of\r\nlarge classes is in the Old World, it is yet full of toil and trouble.\r\nIn New York, some friends, wishing to impress me with a conviction of\r\nthe enviable lives of American ladies, told me how the rich merchants\r\ntake handsome houses in the upper part of the city, and furnish them\r\nsplendidly for their wives: how these gentlemen rise early, snatch their\r\nbreakfasts, hurry off two or three miles to their counting-houses,\r\nbustle about in the heat and dust, noise and traffic of Pearl Street all\r\nthe long summer's day, and come home in the evening, almost too wearied\r\nto eat or speak; while their wives, for whose sake they have thus been\r\ntoiling after riches, have had the whole day to water their flowers,\r\nread the last English novel, visit their acquaintance, and amuse\r\nthemselves at the milliner's; paying, perhaps, 100 dollars for the\r\nnewest Paris bonnet. The representation had a different effect from what\r\nwas expected. It appeared to me that if the ladies prefer their\r\nhusbands' society to that of morning visitors and milliners, they are\r\nquite as much to be pitied as their husbands, that such a way of\r\nconsuming life is considered necessary or honourable. If they would\r\nprefer to wear bonnets costing a dollar a-piece, and having some\r\nenjoyment of domestic life, their fate is mournful; if they prefer\r\nhundred dollar bonnets to the enjoyment of domestic life, their lot is\r\nthe most mournful of all. In either case, they and their husbands cannot\r\nbut be restless and dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nI was at a ball in New York, the splendour of which equalled that of\r\nany entertainment I ever witnessed. A few days after, the lady who gave\r\nthe ball asked me whether I did not disapprove of the show and luxury of\r\ntheir society. I replied, that of whatever was done for mere show, I did\r\ndisapprove; but that I liked luxury, and approved of it, as long as the\r\npleasures of some did not encroach on the rights of others.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said she, \"our husbands have to pay for it all. They work very\r\nhard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is their own choice to do so. I should make a different\r\nchoice, perhaps; but if they prefer hard work and plenty of money to\r\nindulge their families with, to moderate work and less money, I do not\r\nsee how you can expect me to blame them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, but we all live beyond our incomes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, your pleasures encroach on the rights of others, and I\r\nhave no more to say.\"\r\n\r\nIf this be true, how should this class be otherwise than restless and\r\ndissatisfied?\r\n\r\nAre the mechanic and farming classes satisfied? No: not even they:\r\noutwardly blessed as they are beyond any class that society has ever\r\ncontained. They, too, are aware that life must be meant to be passed far\r\notherwise than in providing the outward means of living. They must be\r\naware that though, by great industry, they can obtain some portion of\r\ntime for occupations which are not money-getting, there must be\r\nsomething wrong in the system which compels men to devote almost the\r\nwhole of their waking hours to procure that which, under a different\r\ncombination of labour, might be obtained at a saving of three-fourths of\r\nthe time. Whether their thoughts have been expressly turned to this\r\nsubject or not, almost all the members of society are conscious that\r\ncare for their external wants is so engrossing as to absorb almost all\r\nother cares; and that they would most thankfully agree to work in their\r\nvocation for the community for a short portion of every day, on\r\ncondition of being spared all future anxiety about their physical\r\nnecessities. They who best know the blessings inseparable from toil; who\r\nare aware that the inner life is nourished by the activity of the outer,\r\nyet perceive of what infinite consequence it is to their progress that\r\nthis activity should be varied in its objects, and separated as far as\r\npossible from association with physical necessities, and selfish\r\npossession. The poor man is rightly instructed, in the present state of\r\nthings, when he is told that it is his first duty to provide for his own\r\nwants. The lesson is at present true, because the only alternative is\r\nencroachment on the rights of others: but it is a very low lesson in\r\ncomparison with that which will be taught in the days when mutual and\r\nself-perfection will be the prevalent idea which the civilisation of the\r\ntime will express. No thinking man or woman, who reflects on the amount\r\nof time, thought, and energy, which would be set free by the pressure of\r\ncompetition and money-getting being removed,--time, thought, and energy\r\nnow spent in wearing out the body, and in partially stimulating and\r\npartially wasting the mind, can be satisfied under the present system.\r\n\r\nIn England, the prevalent dissatisfaction must subsist a long time\r\nbefore anything effectual can be done to relieve it. The English are\r\nhampered with institutions in which the rights of individual property\r\nare involved in almost hopeless intricacy. Though clear-sighted persons\r\nperceive that property is the great harbourage of crime and misery, the\r\nadversary of knowledge, the corrupter of peace, the extinguisher of\r\nfaith and charity; though they perceive that institutions for the\r\nregulation of outward affairs all follow the same course, being first\r\nnecessary, then useful, then useless, pernicious, and finally\r\nintolerable,--that property is thus following the same course as\r\nslavery, which was once necessary, and is now intolerable,--as monarchy,\r\nwhich was once necessary, and is now useless, if not pernicious: though\r\nall this is clearly perceived by many far-seeing persons in England,\r\nthey can do nothing but wait till the rest of society sees it too. They\r\nmust be and are well content to wait; since no changes are desirable but\r\nthose which proceed from the ripened mind and enlightened will of\r\nsociety. Thus it is in England. In America the process will be more\r\nrapid. The democratic principles of their social arrangements, operating\r\nalready to such an equalisation of property as has never before been\r\nwitnessed, are favourable to changes which are indeed necessary to the\r\nfull carrying out of the principles adopted. When the people become\r\ntired of their universal servitude to worldly anxiety,--when they have\r\nfully meditated and discussed the fact that ninety-nine hundredths of\r\nsocial offences arise directly out of property; that the largest\r\nproportion of human faults bear a relation to selfish possession; that\r\nthe most formidable classes of diseases are caused by over or under\r\ntoil, and by anxiety of mind; they will be ready for the inquiry whether\r\nthis tremendous incubus be indeed irremovable; and whether any\r\ndifficulties attending its removal can be comparable to the evils it\r\ninflicts. In England, the people have not only to rectify the false\r\nprinciples of barbarous policy, but to surmount the accumulation of\r\nabuses which they have given out: a work, perhaps, of ages. In America,\r\nthe people have not much more to do (the will being once ripe) than to\r\nretrace the false steps which their imitation of the old world has led\r\nthem to take. Their accumulation of abuses is too small to be a serious\r\nobstacle in the way of the united will of a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is objected that the majority of society in America would have a\r\nhorror of any great change like that contemplated: and that, though in\r\nbondage to worldly anxiety, they are unconscious of their servitude, or\r\nreconciled to it. Well: as long as this is the case, they have no change\r\nto dread; for all such alteration must proceed from their own will.\r\nThere is no power upon earth from which they have any compulsion to\r\nfear. Yet it may be allowed to their friends to speculate upon the\r\nbetter condition which is believed to await them. When we look at a\r\ncaterpillar, we like to anticipate the bright day when it will be a\r\nbutterfly. If we could talk about it with the caterpillar, it would\r\nprobably be terrified at the idea, and plead the exceeding danger of\r\nbeing high up in the air. We do not desire or endeavour to force or\r\nhasten the process: yet the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, without any\r\nfinal objection on its own part.\r\n\r\nThe principal fear, expressed or concealed, of those who dislike the\r\nmere mention of the outgrowth of individual property is lest they should\r\nbe deprived of their occupations, objects, and interests. But no such\r\ndeprivation can take place till they will have arrived at preferring\r\nother interests than money, and at pursuing their favourite occupation\r\nwith other views than of obtaining wealth. \"O, what shall I ever do\r\nwithout my currant leaves?\" might the caterpillar exclaim. \"How shall I\r\never get rid of the day, if I must not crawl along the twigs any more?\"\r\nBy the time it has done with crawling, it finds a pair of wings\r\nunfolding, which make crawling appear despicable in comparison. It is\r\nconscious, also, of a taste for nectar, which is better than\r\ncurrant-leaves, be they of the juiciest. Men may safely dismiss all\r\ncare about the future gratification of their tastes under new\r\ncircumstances, as long as it happens to be the change of tastes which\r\nbrings about the change of circumstances, the incompatibility between\r\nthe two being lessened at every transition.\r\n\r\nAs for the details of the future economy indicated, it will be time\r\nenough for them when the idea which now burns like a taper in scattered\r\nminds shall have caught, and spread, and lighted up all into an\r\nillumination sufficient to do the work by. Whenever a healthy hunger\r\nenables the popular mind to assimilate a great principle, there are\r\nalways strong and skilful hands enough to do the requisite work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Americans (in America) are the best I ever saw: and\r\nthese are seen to the greatest advantage in their homes, and as to the\r\ngentlemen, in travelling. But for the drawback of inferior health, I\r\nknow of no such earthly paradise as some of the homes in which I have\r\nhad the honour and blessing of spending portions of the two years of my\r\nabsence. The hospitality of the country is celebrated; but I speak now\r\nof more than usually meets the eye of a stranger; of the family manners,\r\nwhich travellers have rarely leisure or opportunity to observe. If I am\r\nasked what is the peculiar charm, I reply with some hesitation: there\r\nare so many. But I believe it is not so much the outward plenty, or the\r\nmutual freedom, or the simplicity of manners, or the incessant play of\r\nhumour, which characterise the whole people, as the sweet temper which\r\nis diffused like sunshine over the land. They have been called the most\r\ngood-tempered people in the world: and I think they must be so. The\r\neffect of general example is here most remarkable. I met, of course,\r\nwith persons of irritable temperament; with hot-tempered, and with\r\nfidgetty people; with some who were disposed to despotism, and others to\r\ncontradiction: but it was delightful to see how persons thus afflicted\r\nwere enabled to keep themselves in order; were so wrought upon by the\r\ngeneral example of cheerful helpfulness as to be restrained from\r\nclouding their homes by their moods. I have often wondered what the\r\nAmericans make of European works of fiction in which ailing tempers are\r\nexhibited. European fiction does not represent such in half the extent\r\nand variety in which they might be truly and profitably exhibited: but I\r\nhave often wondered what the Americans make of them, such as they are.\r\nThey possess the initiatory truth, in the variety of temperaments which\r\nexists among themselves, as everywhere else; and in the moods of\r\nchildren: but the expansion of deformed tempers in grown people must\r\nstrike them as monstrous caricatures.\r\n\r\nOf course, there must be some general influence which sweetens or\r\nrestrains the temper of a whole nation, of the same Saxon race which is\r\nnot everywhere so amiable. I imagine that the practice of forbearance\r\nrequisite in a republic is answerable for this pleasant peculiarity. In\r\na republic, no man can in theory overbear his neighbour; nor, as he\r\nvalues his own rights, can he do it much or long in practice. If the\r\nmoral independence of some, of many, sinks under this equal pressure\r\nfrom all sides, it is no little set-off against such an evil that the\r\noutbreaks of domestic tyranny are thereby restrained; and that the\r\nrespect for mutual rights which citizens have perpetually enforced upon\r\nthem abroad, comes thence to be observed towards the weak and\r\nunresisting in the privacy of home.\r\n\r\nSome may find it difficult to reconcile this prevalence of good temper\r\nwith the amount of duelling in the United States; with the recklessness\r\nof life which is not confined to the semi-barbarous parts of the\r\ncountry. When it is understood that in New Orleans there were fought, in\r\n1834, more duels than there are days in the year, fifteen on one Sunday\r\nmorning; that in 1835, there were 102 duels fought in that city between\r\nthe 1st of January and the end of April; and that no notice is taken of\r\nshooting in a quarrel; when the world remembers the duel between Clay\r\nand Randolph; that Hamilton fell in a duel; and several more such\r\ninstances, there may be some wonder that a nation where such things\r\nhappen, should be remarkably good-tempered. But New Orleans is no rule\r\nfor any place but itself. The spirit of caste, and the fear of\r\nimputation, rage in that abode of heathen licentiousness. The duels\r\nthere are, almost without exception, between boys for frivolous causes.\r\nAll but one of the 102 were so. And even on the spot, there is some\r\nfeeling of disgust and shame at the extent of the practice. A Court of\r\nHonour was instituted for the restraint of the practice; of course,\r\nwithout effectual result. Its function degenerated into choosing weapons\r\nfor the combatants, so that it ended by sanctioning, instead of\r\nrepressing, duelling. Those who fight the most frequently and fatally\r\nare the French creoles, who use small swords.\r\n\r\nThe extreme cases which afford the clearest reading of the folly and\r\nwickedness of the practice,--of the meanness of the fear which lies at\r\nthe bottom of it,--are producing their effect. The young men who go\r\ninto the west to be the founders of new societies are in some instances\r\ntaking their responsibility to heart, and resolving to use well their\r\ngreat opportunity for substituting a true for a false, a moral for a\r\nphysical courage. The dreadful affair at Philadelphia, never to be\r\nforgotten there, when a quiet, inoffensive young man, the only child of\r\na widowed mother, was forced out into the field, against his strongest\r\nremonstrances, made to stand up, and shot through the heart, could not\r\nbut produce its effect. One of the principal agents was degraded in the\r\nAmerican navy, (but has been since reinstated,) and none of the parties\r\nconcerned has ever stood as well with society as other men since.\r\nHamilton's fall, again, has opened men's eyes to the philosophy of\r\nduelling, and is working to that purpose, more and more. At the time, it\r\nwas pretty generally agreed that he could not help fighting; now, there\r\nare few who think so. His correspondence with his murderer, previous to\r\nthe duel, is remarkable. Having been told, on my entrance into the\r\ncountry, that Hamilton had been its \"greatest man,\" I was interested in\r\nseeing what a greater than Washington could say in excuse for risking\r\nhis life in so paltry a way. I read his correspondence with Colonel Burr\r\nwith pain. There is fear in every line of it; a complicated, disgraceful\r\nfear. He was obviously perishing between two fears--of losing his life,\r\nand of not being able to guard his own honour against the attacks of a\r\nruffian. Between these two fears he fell. I was talking over the\r\ncorrespondence with a duelling gentleman, \"O,\" said he, \"Hamilton went\r\nout like a capuchin.\" So the \"greatest man\" did not obtain even that for\r\nwhich he threw away what he knew was considered the most valuable life\r\nin the country. This is as it should be. When contempt becomes the\r\nwages of slavery to a false idea of honour, it will cease to stand in\r\nthe way of the true; and \"greatest men\" will not end their lives in\r\nlittleness.\r\n\r\nCertain extreme cases which occur on the semi-barbarous confines of the\r\ncountry come occasionally in aid of such lessons as those I have cited.\r\nA passenger on board the \"Henry Clay,\" in which I ascended the\r\nMississippi, showed in perfection the results of a false idea of honour.\r\nHe belonged to one of the first families in Kentucky, had married well,\r\nand settled at Natchez, Mississippi. His wife was slandered by a\r\nresident of Natchez, who, refusing to retreat, was shot dead by the\r\nhusband, who fled to Texas. The wife gathered their property together,\r\nfollowed her husband, was shipwrecked below New Orleans, and lost all.\r\nHer wants were supplied by kind persons at New Orleans, and she was\r\nforwarded by them to her destination, but soon died of cholera. Her\r\nhusband went up into Missouri, and settled in a remote part of it to\r\npractise law; but with a suspicion that he was dogged by the relations\r\nof the man he had shot. One day he met a man muffled in a cloak, who\r\nengaged with him, shot him in both sides, and stabbed him with an\r\nArkansas knife. The victim held off the knife from wounding him mortally\r\ntill help came, and his foe fled. The wounded man slowly recovered; but\r\nhis right arm was so disabled as to compel him to postpone his schemes\r\nof revenge. He ascertained that his enemy had fled to Texas; followed\r\nhim there; at length met him, one fine evening, riding, with his\r\ndouble-barrelled gun before him. They knew each other instantly: the\r\ndouble-barrelled gun was raised and pointed; but before it could be\r\nfired, its owner fell from the saddle, shot dead like the brother he had\r\nsought to avenge. The murderer was flying up the river once more when I\r\nsaw him, not doubting that he should again be dogged by some relation of\r\nthe brothers he had shot. Some of the gentlemen on board believed that\r\nif he surrendered himself at Natchez, he would be let off with little or\r\nno punishment, and allowed to settle again in civilised society; but he\r\nwas afraid of the gallows, and intended to join some fur company in the\r\nnorth-west, if he could; and if he failed in this, to make himself a\r\nchief of a tribe of wandering Indians.\r\n\r\nThis story may be useful to those (if such there be) for whom the\r\ncatastrophe of Hamilton is not strong enough. The two cases differ in\r\ndegree, not in kind.\r\n\r\nThat such hubbub as this is occasioned by a false idea of honour, and\r\nnot by fault of temper, is made clear by the amiability shown by\r\nAmericans, in all cases where their idea of honour is not concerned. In\r\ncircumstances of failure and disappointment, delay, difficulty, and\r\nother provocation, they show great self-command. In all cases that I\r\nwitnessed, from the New York fire, and baffled legislation, down to the\r\nbeing \"mired\" in bad roads, they appeared to be proof against\r\nirritation. Sometimes this went further than I could quite understand.\r\n\r\nWhile travelling in Virginia, we were anxious one day to push on, and\r\nwaste no time. Our \"exclusive extra\" drew up before a single house,\r\nwhere we were to breakfast. We told the landlady that we were\r\nexcessively hungry, and in some hurry, and that we should be obliged by\r\nher giving us anything she happened to have cooked, without waiting for\r\nthe best she could do for us. The woman was the picture of laziness, of\r\nthe most formal kind. She kept us waiting till we thought of going on\r\nwithout eating. When summoned to table, at length, we asked the driver\r\nto sit down with us, to save time. Never did I see a more ludicrous\r\nscene than that breakfast. The lady at the tea-tray, tossing the great\r\nbunch of peacocks' feathers, to keep off the flies, and as solemn as\r\nRhadamanthus. So was our whole party, for fear of laughter from which we\r\nshould not be able to recover. Everything on the table was sour; it\r\nseemed as if studiously so. The conflict between our appetites and the\r\ndisgust of the food was ridiculous. We all presently gave up but the\r\nravenous driver. He tried the bread, the coffee, the butter, and all\r\nwere too sour for a second mouthful; so were the eggs, and the ham, and\r\nthe steak. No one ate anything, and the charge was as preposterous as\r\nthe delay; yet our paymaster made no objection to the way we were\r\ntreated. When we were off again, I asked him why he had been so gracious\r\nas to appear satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"This is a newly-opened road,\" he replied; \"the people do not know yet\r\nhow the world lives. They have probably no idea that there is better\r\nfood than they set before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do not you think it would be a kindness to inform them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did their best for us, and I should be sorry to hurt their\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you would have them go through life on bad food, and inflicting it\r\non other people, lest their feelings should be hurt at their being told\r\nhow to provide better. Do you suppose that all the travellers who come\r\nthis way will be as tender of the lady's feelings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. You see the driver took it very quietly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we were yet worse treated, however, just after, when spending a\r\nnight at Woodstock, our paymaster did remonstrate, (though very\r\ntenderly,) and his remonstrance was received with great candour by the\r\nmaster of the house; his wife being the one most to blame.\r\n\r\nWith this forbearance is united the most cheerful and generous\r\nhelpfulness. If a farmer is burned out, his neighbours collect, and\r\nnever leave him till he is placed in a better house than the one he has\r\nlost. His barns, in like case, are filled with contributions from their\r\ncrops. Though there is nothing that men prize there so much as time,\r\nthere is nothing that they are more ready to give to the service of\r\nothers. Their prevalent generosity in the giving of money is known, and\r\nsufficiently estimated, considering how plentiful wealth is in the\r\ncountry. The expenditure of time, thought, and ingenuity, is a far\r\nbetter test of the temper from which the helpfulness proceeds. I am\r\nsorry that it is impossible to describe what this temper is in America;\r\nits manifestations being too incessant and minute for description. If\r\nthis great virtue could be exhibited as clearly as it is possible to\r\nexhibit their faults, the heart of society would warm towards the\r\nAmericans more readily than it has ever been alienated from them by\r\ntheir own faults, or the ill-offices of strangers.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the Americans are generally unaware how one bad\r\nhabit of their own, springing out of this very temper, goes to aggravate\r\nthe evil offices of strangers. It is to me the most prominent of their\r\nbad habits; but one so likely to be cured by their being made aware of\r\nit, that I cannot but wish that some of the English vituperation which\r\nhas been expended upon tobacco and its effects had been directed upon\r\nthe far more serious fault of flattery. It will be seen at once how the\r\npractice of flattery is almost a necessary result of the combination of\r\na false idea of honour with kindliness of temper. Its prevalence is so\r\ngreat as to tempt one to call it a necessary result. There is no\r\ngetting out of the way of it. A gentleman, who was a depraved\r\nschool-boy, a fiendish husband, father, and slave-owner, whose\r\nreputation for brutality was as extensive as the country, was eulogised\r\nin the newspapers at his death. Every book that comes out is exalted to\r\nthe skies. The public orators flatter the people; the people flatter the\r\norators. Clergymen praise their flocks; and the flocks stand amazed at\r\nthe excellence of their clergymen. Sunday-school teachers admire their\r\npupils; and the scholars magnify their teachers. As to guests,\r\nespecially from abroad, hospitality requires that some dark corner\r\nshould be provided in every room where they may look when their own\r\npraises are being told to their own faces. Even in families, where, if\r\nanywhere, it must be understood that love cannot be sweetened by praise,\r\nthere is a deficiency of that modesty, \"simplicity and godly sincerity,\"\r\nin regard to mutual estimate, which the highest fidelity of affection\r\ninspires.\r\n\r\nPassing over the puerility and vulgarity of the practice,--I think, if\r\nthe Americans were convinced of its selfishness,--of its being actually\r\na breach of benevolence, they would exercise the same command over their\r\ntongues that they do over their tempers, and suppress painful praises,\r\nas they rise to the lips. It was pleaded to me that the admiration is\r\nreal, the praise sincere. Be it so: but why are they to be expressed,\r\nmore than any other real thoughts whose expression would give pain? Let\r\nthe admiration by all means be enjoyed: but what a pity to destroy\r\nsympathy with the person admired, by talking on the very subject at\r\nwhich sympathy must cease! Is it not clear that if praise be not painful\r\nto the person praised, it must be injurious? If he be modest, it is\r\ntorture: if not, it is poison. Or, if there be a third case, and it is\r\nindifferent, such indifference to the praise is very nearly allied to\r\ncontempt for the praiser. When once the decencies of friendship are\r\nviolated, and the modesty of mutual estimate is gone, the holiness of\r\nfriendship is gone too; and there is every danger that selfish,\r\nconscious passion will overbear unconscious, disinterested affection.\r\nEnough. I would only put it to any person whether the friendship he\r\nvalues most is not that which is least coarsened by praise; and in which\r\nhe and his friend are led the least frequently to think of their opinion\r\nof each other. I would put it to the intimates of such a man as Dr.\r\nChanning, for instance, whether their warmest affections do not spring\r\ntowards and repose upon him in the delicious certainty, that while he is\r\nsympathising with every pure and true emotion, he will refrain from\r\ndisturbing its flow by introducing a consciousness, a self and mutual\r\nreference, from which it is the highest privilege in life to escape.\r\nPraise may help some common-minded persons over the difficulties of a\r\nnew and superficial intercourse: at least, so I am told: but intimate\r\ncommunion and permanent friendship require a purity and repose with\r\nwhich the interchange of expressed admiration is absolutely\r\nincompatible.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spirit of intercourse, nothing more remains to be\r\nsaid here, but that the frankness practised in private life, within the\r\ndoors of home, is as remarkable as the caution and reserve which prevail\r\nelsewhere. Nothing can be more delightful than the familiarity and\r\nconfidence with which I was invariably treated; and to which I saw few\r\nexceptions in the cases of other persons. Everything was discussed in\r\nevery house I staid in: religion, philosophy, literature; and, with\r\nquite as much freedom, character, public and private, national and\r\nindividual. The language being the same as my own, I was apt to forget\r\nthat I was on my travels, till some visitor dropped in whose inquiries\r\nhow I liked the country reminded me that I was a foreigner. Even now,\r\nhaving performed the voyage home, and having all manner of evidence that\r\nI have left the country three thousand miles behind me, I find it\r\ndifficult to bring in my personal friends as elements of the society\r\nwhose condition I am pondering. They are too like brothers and sisters\r\nto be subjects for analysis: and I perpetually feel the want of them at\r\nhand, to assist me by their controverting or corroborating judgments.\r\nThey and I know what their homes are, and how happy we have been in\r\nthem: and this is all that in my affection for them I can say of their\r\ndomestic life, without putting a force upon their feelings and my own.\r\n\r\nIf I am not much mistaken, society in the new world is wakening up,\r\nunder the stimulus of the slave-question, to a sense of its want of\r\npractical freedom, owing to its too great regard to opinion. The\r\nexamples of those who can and do assert and maintain their liberty in\r\nthese times of fiery trial, are venerable and beautiful in the eyes of\r\nthe young. Those in the cities who have grown old in the practice of\r\nmistrust are unconscious of the extent of their privations: but the free\r\nyeomanry, and the youth of the towns, have an eye for the right, and a\r\nheart for the true, amid the mists and subtleties in which truth and\r\nliberty have been of late involved. The young men of Boston, especially,\r\nseem to be roused: and it is all-important that they should be. Boston\r\nis looked to throughout the Union, as the superior city she believes\r\nherself to be: and nowhere is the entrance upon life more perilous to\r\nthe honesty and consistency of young aspirants after the public service.\r\nMassachusetts is the head-quarters of federalism. Federalism is\r\nreceding before democracy, even there; but that State has still a\r\nfederal majority. A Massachusetts man has little chance of success in\r\npublic life, unless he starts a federalist: and he has no chance of\r\nrising above a certain low point, unless, when he reaches that point, he\r\nmakes a transition into democracy. The trial is too great for the moral\r\nindependence of most ambitious men: and it fixes the eyes of the world\r\non the youth of Boston. They are watched, that it may be seen whether\r\nthey who now burn with ardour for complete freedom will hereafter\r\n\"reverence the dreams of their youth,\" or sink down into cowardice,\r\napathy, and intolerance, as they reach the middle of life.\r\n\r\nIf they will only try, they will find how great are the ease and peace\r\nattendant on the full exercise of rights, even though it should shut the\r\ncareer of politics, and possibly of wealth, against them for a time. If\r\nthey will look in the faces of the few who dare to live in the midst of\r\nBoston as freely as if they were in the centre of the prairies, they\r\nwill see in those countenances a brightness and serenity which a sense\r\nof mere safety could never impart. The pursuit of safety,--safety from\r\noutward detriment,--is of all in this world the most hopeless. The only\r\nattainable safety is that which usually bears another name,--repose in\r\nabsolute truth. Where there is a transparency of character which defies\r\nmisrepresentation, a faith in men which disarms suspicion, an\r\nintrepidity which overawes malice, and a spirit of love which wins\r\nconfidence, there is safety; and in nothing short of all these. If any\r\nof them are deficient, in the same proportion does safety give place to\r\ndanger; and no substitution of prudence will be of more than temporary\r\navail. Prudence is now reigning supreme over the elderly classes of\r\nBoston generally, and too many of the young. Independence is animating\r\nthe rest. It remains to be seen which will have succumbed when the\r\npresent youth of the city shall have become her legislators,\r\nmagistrates, and social representatives.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the thoughts and feelings of some on the spot, I give\r\nthe following.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty of thought and opinion is strenuously maintained: in this proud\r\nland it has become almost a wearisome cant: our speeches and journals,\r\nreligious and political, are made nauseous by the vapid and\r\nvain-glorious reiteration. But does it, after all, _characterise any\r\ncommunity among us_? Is there any one to which a qualified observer\r\nshall point, and say, _There_ opinion is free? On the contrary, is it\r\nnot a fact, a sad and deplorable fact, that in no land on this earth is\r\nthe mind more fettered than it is here? that here what we call public\r\nopinion has set up a despotism, such as exists nowhere else? Public\r\nopinion,--a tyrant, sitting in the dark, wrapt up in mystification and\r\nvague terrors of obscurity; deriving power no one knows from whom; like\r\nan Asian monarch, unapproachable, unimpeachable, undethronable, perhaps\r\nillegitimate,--but irresistible in its power to quell thought, to\r\nrepress action, to silence conviction,--and bringing the timid\r\nperpetually under an unworthy bondage of mean fear to some impostor\r\nopinion, some noisy judgment, which gets astride on the popular breath\r\nfor a day, and controls, through the lips of impudent folly, the speech\r\nand actions of the wise. From this influence and rule, from this bondage\r\nto opinion, no community, as such, is free; though doubtless individuals\r\nare. But your community, brethren, based on the principles which you\r\nprofess, is bound to be so.\"[22]\r\n\r\nSo much for the spirit of intercourse. As for the modes in which the\r\nspirit is manifested, their agreeableness, or the contrary, is a matter\r\nof taste. No nation can pretend to judge another's manners; for the\r\nplain reason that there is no standard to judge by: and if an individual\r\nattempts to pronounce upon them, his sentence amounts to nothing more\r\nthan a declaration of his own particular taste. If such a declaration\r\nfrom an individual is of any consequence, I am ready to acknowledge that\r\nthe American manners please me, on the whole, better than any that I\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which strike a stranger unpleasantly are the apparent\r\ncoldness and indifference of persons in hotels and shops; the use of\r\ntobacco, and consequent spitting; the tone of voice, especially among\r\nthe New England ladies; and at first, but not afterwards, the style of\r\nconversation. The great charm is the exquisite mutual respect and\r\nkindliness.\r\n\r\nOf the tobacco and its consequences, I will say nothing but that the\r\npractice is at too bad a pass to leave hope that anything that could be\r\nsaid in books would work a cure. If the floors of boarding-houses, and\r\nthe decks of steam-boats, and the carpets of the Capitol, do not sicken\r\nthe Americans into a reform; if the warnings of physicians are of no\r\navail, what remains to be said? I dismiss the nauseous subject.\r\n\r\nA great unknown pleasure remains to be experienced by the Americans in\r\nthe well-modulated, gentle, healthy, cheerful voices of women. It is\r\nincredible that there should not, in all time to come, be any other\r\nalternative than that which now exists, between a whine and a twang.\r\nWhen the health of the American women improves, their voices will\r\nimprove. In the meantime, they are unconscious how the effect of their\r\nremarkable and almost universal beauty is injured by their mode of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity is less remarkable in manly conversation. The\r\nconversation of the gentlemen strikes one at first as being dull and\r\nprosy. They converse with much evenness of tone, slowly and at great\r\nlength: so as to leave the observer without any surprise that the\r\nAmericans think English conversation hasty, sharp, and rough. I found\r\nalso a prevalent idea that conversation is studied as an art in England:\r\nand many of my friends were so positive on this point as to make me\r\ndoubt the correctness of my own conviction that it is not so. If there\r\nbe any such study, I can only say that I have detected no instances of\r\nit; nor did the idea ever enter my mind except in reading of Lady\r\nAngelica Headingham, in 'Patronage.' In the whole course of my life,\r\nperhaps, I never met with so many particular instances of an artificial\r\nmode of conversing as during the two years that I was in America: but I\r\ncould see the reason in every case; and that all were exceptions to the\r\nrule of natural though peculiar communication. The conversation of the\r\ngreat public men was generally more instructive than pleasing, till they\r\nforgot that they were public men, and talked on other things than public\r\naffairs. One could never conceal that he designed to effect a particular\r\npersuasion in your mind: a design against which all the listener's\r\nfaculties are sure to rise up in instant rebellion. Another did not\r\nintend you should see that he was speaking from a map of the subject in\r\nhis brain; bringing contrasts and comparisons to bear, as it might seem\r\naccidentally, upon your imagination. Two or three or more, willing to\r\nconceal from themselves, I really believe, as well as from the stranger,\r\nthat logic is not their forte, dart off after every will-o'-the-wisp of\r\nan analogy; and talk almost wholly in figures. This is bad policy; for\r\nsome of the figures were so beautiful and apparently illustrative, as to\r\nfix the attention, instead of passing over the ear, and give one time\r\nto discover that they were not satisfactory. The most remarkable\r\ninstances of this were in the south, where I had the pleasure of hearing\r\nmore of every thing than of logic. Perhaps the most singular style of\r\nall was one which struck me so much that I wrote down pages of it for\r\nsubsequent study:--a slow, impressive style, a succession of clever\r\nfigures, a somewhat pompous humour, and a wrapping round of inconvenient\r\nconsiderations with an impenetrable cloud of the plainest-seeming words.\r\nThe gushing talk of Judge Story, the brimmings of a full head and heart,\r\nnatural, lively, fresh, issuing from the supposition that you can\r\nunderstand, and wish to understand everything that is interesting to\r\nhim, and from a simple psychological curiosity, is perfectly delightful\r\nafter the measured communications of some other public men.\r\n\r\nI may here mention Dr. Channing's conversation. I do so because it has\r\nbeen the occasion of his being much misunderstood and consequently\r\nmisrepresented. I never knew a case where the conversation of an\r\nindividual did him so much injustice at first, and such eminent service\r\nin the affections of his hearers at last. Unfortunately, those who\r\nreport him generally see him only once or twice; and then they are\r\npretty sure to leave him with less real knowledge of him than they\r\nprobably had three thousand miles off. This circumstance may justify my\r\nspeaking here of one whom I revere and regard too much to feel it easy\r\nto say anything of him publicly beyond the mere testimony which it is an\r\nhonour to bear to such men. Dr. Channing has an unfortunate habit of\r\nsuiting his conversation to the supposed state of mind of the person he\r\nis conversing with, or to that person's supposed knowledge on a subject\r\non which he wants information. The adaptation, not being natural, cannot\r\nbe true, and something is thus given out which is the reflection of\r\nnobody's mind; and the conversation is fruitless or worse. This is\r\nmerely a habit of _drawing out_. If the visitor goes away upon this, he\r\nreports the things which are reported of Dr. Channing's opinions; which\r\nare no more like his than they are like Aristotle's. If the visitor\r\nstays long enough, or comes again often enough to catch some of his\r\nthoughts as they issue from his heart, he finds a strange power in them\r\nto move and kindle. His words become deeds when they proceed from\r\nimpulse. Not a tone nor a syllable can be ever forgotten. The reason is\r\nthat unseen things are to him realities; and material things are but\r\nshadows. After continued and open communication with him, it becomes an\r\ninexplicable wonder that anything but truth, justice, and charity should\r\nbe made objects of serious pursuit in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison's conversation has been already mentioned as being full of\r\ngraces. The sprightliness, rapidity, and variety were remarkable in a\r\nman of eighty-four, confined to two rooms, and subject to various\r\ninfirmities. He was a highly favourable specimen of the accomplished\r\ngentleman of the revolutionary times.\r\n\r\nThere are persons whom it seems to myself strange to name in this\r\nconnexion, when there are things in them which I value much more highly\r\nthan their eloquence. But as eloquent beyond all others, they must be\r\nmentioned here. I refer to Dr. and Mrs. Follen, late of Boston.--Dr.\r\nFollen is a German: well known in Germany for his patriotism; as\r\ntroublesome to its princes as animating to their subjects. He has been\r\nthirteen years in America, and seven years a citizen of Massachusetts.\r\nHis mastery of the language has been perfect for some years: but, as he\r\nbrought a rich and matured mind to the first employment of it, he uses\r\nit differently from any to whom it is the mother tongue. It is an\r\ninstrument of extraordinary power in his hands, as a mere instrument.\r\nBut he is a man of learning which I do not pretend to estimate in any\r\ndepartment. The great mass of his knowledge is vivified by a spirit\r\nwhich seems to have passed through all human experiences, appropriating\r\nwhatever is true and pure, and leaving behind all else. With not only a\r\nreligious love of liberty, but an unerring perception of the true\r\nprinciple of liberty in every case as it arises, with an intrepidity\r\nwhich excites rage where his gentleness is not known, and a gentleness\r\nwhich disarms those who fear his intrepidity, he is the most valuable\r\nacquisition that the United States, in their present condition, can well\r\nbe conceived to have appropriated from the Old World, in the person of\r\nan individual citizen. I certainly think him the most remarkable, and\r\nthe greatest man I saw in the country. Dr. Follen has pledged himself to\r\nthe anti-slavery cause; and declared himself in other ways in favour of\r\nfreedom of thought, action, and speech, so as to make himself\r\nfeared,--(or rather his opinions, for no one can fear himself,)--by some\r\nof the society of his State in whom the idea of honour most wants\r\nrectifying: but, as he becomes more known to the true-hearted among his\r\nfellow-citizens, he will be regarded by them all with the pride and\r\nadmiration, mixed with tender affection, which he inspires in those who\r\nhave the honour and blessing of being his friends. He has married a\r\nBoston lady; a woman of genius, and of those large and kindly affections\r\nwhich are its natural element. What the intercourses of their home are,\r\ntheir guests can never forget; nor ever describe.\r\n\r\nThe most common mode of conversation in America I should distinguish as\r\nprosy, but withal rich and droll. For some weeks, I found it difficult\r\nto keep awake during the entire reply to any question I happened to ask.\r\nThe person questioned seemed to feel himself put upon his conscience to\r\ngive a full, true, and particular reply; and so he went back as near to\r\nthe Deluge as the subject would admit, and forward to the millennium,\r\ntaking care to omit nothing of consequence in the interval. There was,\r\nof course, one here and there, as there is everywhere, to tell me\r\nprecisely what I knew before, and omit what I most wanted: but this did\r\nnot happen often: and I presently found the information I obtained in\r\nconversation so full, impartial, and accurate, and the shrewdness and\r\ndrollery with which it was conveyed so amusing, that I became a great\r\nadmirer of the American way of talking before six months were over.\r\nPrevious to that time, a gentleman in the same house with me expressed\r\npleasantly his surprise at my asking so few questions: saying that if he\r\ncame to England, he should be asking questions all day long. I told him\r\nthat there was no need of my seeking information as long as more was\r\ngiven me in the course of the day than my head would carry. I did not\r\ntell him that I had not power of attention sufficient for such\r\ninformation as came in answer to my own desire. I can scarcely believe\r\nnow that I ever felt such a difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey themselves are, however, aware of their tendency to length, and\r\nalso to something of the literal dulness which Charles Lamb complains of\r\nin relation to the Scotch. They have stories of American travellers\r\nwhich exceed all I ever heard of them anywhere else: such as that an\r\nAmerican gentleman, returned from Europe, was asked how he liked Rome:\r\nto which he replied that Rome was a fine city; but that he must\r\nacknowledge he thought the public buildings were very much out of\r\nrepair. Again, it is told against a lady that she made some undeniably\r\ntrue remarks on a sermon she heard. A preacher, discoursing on the\r\nblindness of men to the future, remarked \"how few men, in building a\r\nhouse, consider that a coffin is to go down the stairs!\" The lady\r\nobserved with much emphasis, on coming out, that ministers had got into\r\nthe strangest way of choosing subjects for the pulpit! It was true that\r\nwide staircases _are_ a great convenience: but she did think Christian\r\nministers might find better subjects to preach upon than narrow\r\nstaircases. And so forth. An eminent Senator told me that he was too\r\noften on the one horn or the other of a dilemma: sometimes a gentleman\r\ngetting up in the Senate, and talking as if he would never sit down: and\r\nsometimes a gentleman sitting down in his study, and talking as if he\r\nwould never get up.\r\n\r\nYet there is an epigrammatic turn in the talk of those who have never\r\nheard of \"the art of conversation\" which is supposed to be studied by\r\nthe English. A reverend divine,--no other than Dr. Channing,--was one\r\nday paying toll, when he perceived a notice of gin, rum, tobacco, &c.,\r\non a board which bore a strong resemblance to a grave-stone. \"I am glad\r\nto see,\" said the Dr. to the girl who received the toll, \"that you have\r\nbeen burying those things.\"--\"And if we had,\" said the girl, \"I don't\r\ndoubt you would have gone chief mourner.\"\r\n\r\nSome young men, travelling on horseback among the White Mountains,\r\nbecame inordinately thirsty, and stopped for milk at a house by the\r\nroad-side. They emptied every basin that was offered, and still wanted\r\nmore. The woman of the house at length brought an enormous bowl of milk,\r\nand set it down on the table, saying, \"One would think, gentlemen, you\r\nhad never been weaned.\"\r\n\r\nOf the same kind was the reply made by a gentleman of Virginia to a\r\nsilly question by a lady. \"Who made the Natural Bridge?\"--\"God knows,\r\nmadam.\"\r\n\r\nI was struck with repeated instances of new versions, generally much\r\nimproved, of old fables. I think the following an improvement upon Sour\r\nGrapes. Noah warned his neighbours of what was coming, and why he was\r\nbuilding his ark; but nobody minded him. When people on the high grounds\r\nwere up to their chins, an old acquaintance of Noah's was very eager to\r\nbe taken into the ark: but Noah refused again and again. \"Well,\" said\r\nthe man, when he found it was in vain, \"go, get along, you and your old\r\nark! I don't believe we are going to have much of a shower.\" I tried to\r\nascertain whether this story was American. I could trace it no further\r\noff than Plymouth, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a stronger contrast than between the fun and simplicity\r\nof the usual domestic talk of the United States, and the solemn pedantry\r\nof which the extremest examples are to be found there; exciting as much\r\nridicule at home as they possibly can elsewhere. I was solemnly assured\r\nby a gentleman that I was quite wrong on some point, because I differed\r\nfrom him. Everybody laughed: when he went on, with the utmost gravity,\r\nto inform us that there had been a time when he believed, like other\r\npeople, that he might be mistaken; but that experience had convinced him\r\nthat he never was; and he had in consequence cast behind him the fear of\r\nerror. I told him I was afraid the place he lived in must be terribly\r\ndull,--having an oracle in it to settle everything. He replied that the\r\nworst of it was, other people were not so convinced of his being always\r\nin the right as he was himself. There was no joke here. He is a literal\r\nand serious-minded man. Another gentleman solemnly remarked upon the\r\nweather of late having been \"uncommonly mucilaginous.\" Another pointed\r\nout to me a gentleman on board a steam-boat as \"a blue stocking of the\r\nfirst class.\" A lady asked me many questions about my emotions at\r\nNiagara, to which I gave only one answer of which she could make\r\nanything. \"Did you not,\" was her last inquiry, \"long to throw yourself\r\ndown, and mingle with your mother earth?\"--\"No.\"--Another asked me\r\nwhether I did not think the sea might inspire vast and singular\r\nideas.--Another, an instructress of youth, in examining my ear-trumpet,\r\nwanted to know whether its length made any difference in its efficiency.\r\nOn my answering, \"None at all\"--\"O certainly not,\" said she, very\r\ndeliberately; \"for, sound being a material substance, can only be\r\novercome by a superior force.\" The mistakes of unconscious ignorance\r\nshould be passed over with a silent smile: but affectation should be\r\nexposed, as a service to a young society.\r\n\r\nI rarely, if ever, met with instances of this pedantry among the\r\nyeomanry or mechanic classes; or among the young. The most numerous and\r\nthe worst pedants were middle-aged ladies. One instance struck me as\r\nbeing unlike anything that could happen in England. A literary and very\r\nmeritorious village mantua-maker declared that it was very hard if her\r\ngowns did not fit the ladies of the neighbourhood. She had got the exact\r\nproportions of the Venus de Medici, to make them by: and what more could\r\nshe do? Again. A sempstress was anxious that her employer should request\r\nme to write something about Mount Auburn: (the beautiful cemetery near\r\nBoston.) Upon her being questioned as to what kind of composition she\r\nhad in her fancy, she said she would have Mount Auburn considered under\r\nthree points of view:--as it was on the day of creation,--as it is\r\nnow,--as it will be on the day of resurrection. I liked the idea so well\r\nthat I got her to write it for me, instead of my doing it for her.\r\n\r\nAs for the peculiarities of language of which so much has been made,--I\r\nam a bad judge: but the fact is, I should have passed through the\r\ncountry almost without observing any, if my attention had not been\r\npreviously directed to them. Next to the well-known use of the word\r\n\"sick,\" instead of \"ill,\" (in which they are undoubtedly right,) none\r\nstruck me so much as the few following. They use the word \"handsome\"\r\nmuch more extensively than we do: saying that Webster made a handsome\r\nspeech in the Senate: that a lady talks handsomely, (eloquently:) that a\r\nbook sells handsomely. A gentleman asked me on the Catskill Mountain,\r\nwhether I thought the sun handsomer there than at New York. When they\r\nspeak of a fine woman, they refer to mental or moral, not at all to\r\nphysical superiority. The effect was strange, after being told, here and\r\nthere, that I was about to see a very fine woman, to meet in such cases\r\nalmost the only plain women I saw in the country. Another curious\r\ncircumstance is, that this is almost the only connexion in which the\r\nword woman is used. This noble word, spirit-stirring as it passes over\r\nEnglish ears, is in America banished, and \"ladies\" and \"females\"\r\nsubstituted: the one to English taste mawkish and vulgar; the other\r\nindistinctive and gross. So much for difference of taste. The effect is\r\nodd. After leaving the men's wards of the prison at Nashville,\r\nTennessee, I asked the warden whether he would not let me see the women.\r\n\"We have no ladies here, at present, madam. We have never had but two\r\nladies, who were convicted for stealing a steak; but, as it appeared\r\nthat they were deserted by their husbands, and in want, they were\r\npardoned.\" A lecturer, discoursing on the characteristics of women, is\r\nsaid to have expressed himself thus. \"Who were last at the cross?\r\nLadies. Who were first at the sepulchre? Ladies.\"\r\n\r\nA few other ludicrous expressions took me by surprise occasionally. A\r\ngentleman in the west, who had been discussing monarchy and\r\nrepublicanism in a somewhat original way, asked me if I would \"swap\" my\r\nking for his. We were often told that it was \"a dreadful fine day;\" and\r\na girl at a hotel pronounced my trumpet to be \"terrible handy.\"[23] In\r\nthe back of Virginia these superlative expressions are the most rife. A\r\nman who was extremely ill, in agonizing pain, sent for a friend to come\r\nto him. Before the friend arrived, the pain was relieved, but the\r\npatient felt much reduced by it. \"How do you find yourself?\" inquired\r\nthe friend. \"I'm powerful weak; but cruel easy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky bragging is well known. It is so ingenious as to be very\r\namusing sometimes: but too absurd in the mouth of a dull person. One\r\nsuch was not satisfied with pointing out to me how fine the woods were,\r\nbut informed me that the intimate texture of the individual leaves was\r\nfiner and richer in Kentucky than anywhere else. I much prefer the\r\noff-hand air with which a dashing Kentuckian intimates to you the\r\nrichness of the soil; saying \"if you plant a nail at night, 'twill come\r\nup a spike next morning.\"\r\n\r\nHowever much may be the fault of strangers, in regard to the coldness of\r\nmanners which is complained of in those who serve travellers in\r\nAmerica, and however soon it may be dissipated by a genial address on\r\nthe part of the stranger, it certainly is very disagreeable at the first\r\nmoment. We invariably found ourselves well-treated; and in no instance\r\nthat I remember failed to dissipate the chill by showing that we were\r\nready to help ourselves, and to be sociable. The instant we attacked the\r\nreserve, it gave way. But I do not wonder that strangers who are not\r\nprepared to make the concession, and especially gentlemen travelling\r\nfrom hotel to hotel, find the constraint extremely irksome. It should\r\nnever be forgotten that it is usually a matter of necessity or of\r\nfavour, seldom of choice, (except in the towns,) that the wife and\r\ndaughters of American citizens render service to travellers. Such a\r\nbreaking in upon their domestic quiet, such an exposure to the society\r\nof casual travellers, must be so distasteful to them generally as to\r\nexcuse any apparent want of cordiality. Some American travellers, won by\r\nthe _empressement_ of European waiters, declare themselves as willing to\r\npay for civility as for their dinner. I acknowledge a different taste. I\r\nhad rather have indifference than civility which bears a reference to\r\nthe bill: but I prefer to either the cordiality which brightens up at\r\nyour offer to make your own bed, mend your own fire, &c.--the cordiality\r\nwhich brings your hostess into your parlour, to draw her chair, and be\r\nsociable, not only by asking where you are going, but by telling you all\r\nthat interests her in her neighbourhood. A girl at a Meadville hotel, in\r\nPennsylvania, urged us to change our route, that we might visit some\r\nfriends of hers,--\"a beautiful bachelor that had lately lost his wife,\r\nand his fine son\"--to whom she would give us a letter of introduction.\r\nAt Maysville, Kentucky, the landlady sent repeated apologies for not\r\nbeing able to wait on us herself, her attendance being necessary at the\r\nbedside of her sick child. On our expressing our concern that, in such\r\ncircumstances, she should trouble herself about us, her substitute said\r\nwe were very unlike the generality of travellers who came. The ladies\r\nwere usually offended if the landlady did not wait upon them herself,\r\nand would not open or shut the window with their own hands; but rang to\r\nhave the landlady to do it for them. Such persons have probably been\r\naccustomed to be waited on by slaves; or, perhaps, not at all; so that\r\nthey like to make the most of the opportunity. Our landlady at\r\nNashville, Tennessee, treated us extremely well; and on parting kissed\r\nthe ladies of the party all round.\r\n\r\nI had an early lesson in the art of distinguishing coldness from\r\ninhospitality. Our party of six was traversing the State of New York. We\r\nleft Syracuse at dawn one morning, intending to breakfast at Skaneatles.\r\nBy the time we reached Elbridge, however, having been delayed on the\r\nroad, we were too hungry to think of going further without food. An\r\nimpetuous young Carolinian, who was of the party, got out first, and\r\nreturned to say we had better proceed; for the house and the people\r\nlooked so cold, we should never be able to achieve a comfortable meal.\r\nCaring less, however, for comfort than for any sort of meal, we\r\npersisted in stopping.--The first room we were shown into was wet, and\r\nhad no fire; and we were already shivering with cold. I could discern\r\nthat the family were clearing out of the next room. It was offered to\r\nus, and logs were piled upon the fire. Two of the young women, in cotton\r\ngowns and braided and bowed hair, followed their mother into the cooking\r\napartment, sailing about with quiet movements and solemn faces. Two more\r\nstaid in the room; and, after putting up their hair before the glass in\r\nour presence, began to arrange the table, knitting between times. One or\r\nanother was almost all the while sitting with us, knitting, and replying\r\nwith grave simplicity to our conversation. Presently, one of the best\r\nbreakfasts we had in America was ready: a pie-dish full of buttered\r\ntoast; hot biscuits and coffee; beef-steak, applesauce, hot potatoes,\r\ncheese, butter, and two large dishes of eggs. We were attentively waited\r\nupon by the four knitting young ladies and their knitting mother, and\r\nkindly dismissed with a charge of only two dollars and a quarter for the\r\nwhole party. \"Did you ever see such girls?\" cried the young Carolinian,\r\njust landed from Europe: \"stepping about like four captive princesses!\"\r\nWe all called out that we would not hear a word against the young\r\nladies. They had treated us with all kindness; and no one could tell\r\nwhether their reserve was any greater than their situation and\r\ncircumstances require.\r\n\r\nSo much more has naturally been observed by travellers of American\r\nmanners in stages and steam-boats than in private-houses, that all has\r\nbeen said, over and over again, that the subject deserves. I need only\r\ntestify that I do not think the Americans eat faster than other people,\r\non the whole. The celerity at hotel-tables is remarkable; but so it is\r\nin stage-coach travellers in England, who are allowed ten minutes or a\r\nquarter of an hour for dining. In private houses, I was never aware of\r\nbeing hurried. The cheerful, unintermitting civility of all gentlemen\r\ntravellers, throughout the country, is very striking to a stranger. The\r\ndegree of consideration shown to women is, in my opinion, greater than\r\nis rational, or good for either party; but the manners of an American\r\nstage-coach might afford a valuable lesson and example to many classes\r\nof Europeans who have a high opinion of their own civilisation. I do\r\nnot think it rational or fair that every gentleman, whether old or\r\nyoung, sick or well, weary or untired, should, as a matter of course,\r\nyield up the best places in the stage to any lady passenger. I do not\r\nthink it rational or fair that five gentlemen should ride on the top of\r\nthe coach, (where there is no accommodation for holding on, and no\r\nresting-place for the feet,) for some hours of a July day in Virginia,\r\nthat a young lady, who was slightly delicate, might have room to lay up\r\nher feet, and change her posture as she pleased. It is obvious that, if\r\nshe was not strong enough to travel on common terms in the stage, her\r\nfamily should have travelled in an extra; or staid behind; or done\r\nanything rather than allow five persons to risk their health, and\r\nsacrifice their comfort, for the sake of one. Whatever may be the good\r\nmoral effects of such self-renunciation on the tempers of the gentlemen,\r\nthe custom is very injurious to ladies. Their travelling manners are\r\nanything but amiable. While on a journey, women who appear well enough\r\nin their homes, present all the characteristics of spoiled children.\r\nScreaming and trembling at the apprehension of danger are not uncommon:\r\nbut there is something far worse in the cool selfishness with which they\r\naccept the best of everything, at any sacrifice to others, and usually,\r\nin the south and west, without a word or look of acknowledgment. They\r\nare as like spoiled children when the gentlemen are not present to be\r\nsacrificed to them;--in the inn parlour, while waiting for meals or the\r\nstage; and in the cabin of a steam-boat. I never saw any manner so\r\nrepulsive as that of many American ladies on board steam-boats. They\r\nlook as if they supposed you mean to injure them, till you show to the\r\ncontrary. The suspicious side-glance, or the full stare; the cold,\r\nimmovable observation; the bristling self-defence the moment you come\r\nnear; the cool pushing to get the best places,--everything said and done\r\nwithout the least trace of trust or cheerfulness,--these are the\r\ndisagreeable consequences of the ladies being petted and humoured as\r\nthey are. The New England ladies, who are compelled by their superior\r\nnumbers to depend less upon the care of others, are far happier and\r\npleasanter companions in a journey than those of the rest of the\r\ncountry. This shows the evil to be altogether superinduced: and I always\r\nfound that if I could keep down my spirit, and show that I meant no\r\nharm, the apathy began to melt, the pretty ladies forgot their\r\nself-defence, and appeared somewhat like what I conclude they are at\r\nhome, when managing their affairs, in the midst of familiar\r\ncircumstances. If these ladies would but inquire of themselves what it\r\nis that they are afraid of, and whether there is any reason why people\r\nshould be less cheerful, less obliging, and less agreeable, when\r\ncasually brought into the society of fifty people, whose comfort depends\r\nmainly on their mutual good offices, than among half-a-dozen neighbours\r\nat home, they might remove an unpleasant feature of the national\r\nmanners, and add another to the many charms of their country.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of village manners in America: but Miss Sedgwick's\r\npictures of them in her two best works, \"Home,\" and \"The Rich Poor Man,\r\nand the Poor Rich Man,\" are so true and so beautiful, and so sure of\r\nbeing well-known where they have not already reached, that no more is\r\nnecessary than to mention them as some of the best and sweetest pictures\r\nof manners in existence. To the English reader they are full as\r\ninteresting as to Americans, from the purity and fidelity of the\r\ndemocratic spirit which they breathe throughout. The woman who so\r\nappreciates the blessing of living in such a society as she describes,\r\ndeserves the honour of being the first to commend it to the affections\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the wealthy classes depend, of course, upon the character\r\nof their objects and interests: but they are not, on the whole, so\r\nagreeable as those of their less opulent neighbours. The restless\r\nostentation of such as live for grandeur and show is vulgar;--as I have\r\nsaid, the only vulgarity to be seen in the country. Nothing can exceed\r\nthe display of it at watering-places. At Rockaway, on Long Island, I saw\r\nin one large room, while the company was waiting for dinner, a number of\r\ngroups which would have made a good year's income for a clever\r\ncaricaturist. If any lady, with an eye and a pencil adequate to the\r\noccasion, would sketch the phenomena of affectation that might be seen\r\nin one day in the piazza and drawing-room at Rockaway, she might be a\r\nuseful censor of manners. But the task would be too full of sorrow and\r\nshame for any one with the true republican spirit. For my own part, I\r\nfelt bewildered in such company. It was as if I had been set down on a\r\nkind of debatable land between the wholly imaginary society of the\r\nso-called fashionable novels of late years, and the broad sketches of\r\ncitizen-life given by Madame D'Arblay. It was like nothing real. When I\r\nsaw the young ladies tricked out in the most expensive finery, flirting\r\nover the backgammon-board, tripping affectedly across the room,\r\nlanguishing with a seventy-dollar cambric handkerchief, starting up in\r\necstasy at the entrance of a baby; the mothers as busy with affectations\r\nof another kind; and the brothers sidling hither and thither, now with\r\nassiduity, and now with nonchalance; and no one imparting the\r\nrefreshment of a natural countenance, movement, or tone, I almost\r\ndoubted whether I was awake. The village scenes that I had witnessed\r\nrose up in strong contrast;--the mirthful wedding, the wagon-drives, the\r\nofferings of wild-flowers to the stranger; the unintermitting, simple\r\ncourtesy of each to all;--and it was scarcely credible that these\r\ncontrasting scenes could both be existing in the same republic.\r\n\r\nSuch watering-place manners as I saw at Rockaway are considered and\r\ncalled vulgar on the spot:--of course, for the majority are far superior\r\nto them. They deserve notice no further than as they are absolutely\r\nanti-republican in their whole principle and spirit: and no deviation\r\nfrom the republican principle in any class should be passed over by the\r\nmoralist without notice. The brand of contempt should be fixed upon any\r\nunprincipled or false-principled style of manners, in a community based\r\nupon avowed principles. The contempt thus inflicted upon the mode may\r\npossibly save the persons who would otherwise render themselves liable\r\nto it. The practice of ostentation may be lessened in America, as that\r\nof suicide was in France, by ridicule and contempt. It is desirable for\r\nall parties that this should be the method. The weak and vain had better\r\nbe deterred from entering upon the race of vanity, than exposed when it\r\nis too late: and, for those of clearer and stronger minds, it is safer\r\nto despise things than persons: for, however necessary and virtuous the\r\ncontempt of abstract vice and folly may be, there is no mind clear and\r\nstrong enough to entertain with safety contempt of persons.\r\n\r\nThe best sort of rich persons, those whose principles and spirit are\r\ndemocratic, their desires moderate, their pursuits rational, drop out of\r\nsight of the mind's eye in considering the manners of the rich. Their\r\nwealth becomes only a comparatively unimportant circumstance connected\r\nwith them. They support more beneficent objects than others, and perhaps\r\nhave houses and libraries that it is a luxury to go to: but these things\r\nare not associated with themselves in the minds of their friends, as\r\nlong as they are not so in their own. They fall into the ranks of the\r\nhonourable, independent, thorough-bred classes of the country, (its true\r\nglory,) just as if they were not rich. The next best order of rich\r\npeople,--those who put their time and money to good uses, but who are\r\nnot blessed with the true democratic spirit of faith, have\r\nmanners,--infinitely better than the Rockaway style,--but not so good as\r\nthose of more faithful republicans. They are above the vanity of show\r\nand the struggle for fashion: but they dread the ascendency of\r\nignorance, and distrust the classes whom they do not know. They are\r\nreaders: their imaginations live in the Old World; and they have\r\ninsensibly adopted the old-world prejudice, that \"the people\" must be\r\nignorant, passionate, and rapacious. The conversation of such gives\r\nutterance to an assumption, and their bearing betrays an uneasiness,\r\nwhich are highly unfavourable to good manners. This small class are so\r\nrespectable in the main, and for some great objects so useful, that it\r\nis much to be desired that they could be referred back perpetually to\r\nthe democratic principles which would relieve their anxiety, and give to\r\ntheir manners that cheerfulness which should belong to honest\r\nrepublicans who have everything to hope, and little to fear.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable sights in the country is the President's\r\nlevee. Nothing is easier than to laugh at it. There is probably no mode\r\nin which a number of human beings can assemble which may not be\r\nlaughable from one point of view or another. The President's levee\r\npresents many facilities for ridicule. Men go there in plain cloaks and\r\nleather belts, with all manner of wigs, and offer a large variety of\r\nobeisance to the chief magistrate. Women go in bonnets and shawls, talk\r\nabout the company, stand upon chairs to look over people's heads, and\r\nstare at the large rooms. There was a story of two girls, thus dressed,\r\nbeing lifted up by their escorting gentlemen, and seated on the two ends\r\nof the mantel-piece, like lustres, where they could obtain a view of the\r\ncompany as they entered. To see such people mixed in with foreign\r\nambassadors and their suites, to observe the small mutual knowledge of\r\nclasses and persons who thus meet on terms of equality, is amusing\r\nenough. But, amidst much that was laughable, I certainly felt that I was\r\nseeing a fine spectacle. If the gentry of Washington desire to do away\r\nwith the custom, they must be unaware of the dignity which resides in\r\nit, and which is apparent to the eye of a stranger, through any\r\ninconveniences which it may have. I am sorry that its recurrence is no\r\nlonger annual. I am sorry that the practice of distributing refreshments\r\nis relinquished: though this is a matter of less importance and of more\r\ninconvenience. If the custom itself should ever be given up, the bad\r\ntaste of such a surrender will be unquestionable. There should be some\r\ntime and place where the chief magistrate and the people may meet to\r\nexchange their respects, all other business being out of the question:\r\nand I should like to see the occasion made annual again.\r\n\r\nI saw no bad manners at the President's levee, except on the part of a\r\nsilly, swaggering Englishman. All was quiet and orderly; and there was\r\nan air of gaiety which rather surprised me. The great people were amused\r\nat the aspect of the assembly: and the humbler at the novelties that\r\nwere going on before their eyes. Our party went at eight o'clock. As we\r\nalighted from the carriage, I saw a number of women, well attended,\r\ngoing up the steps in the commonest morning walking-dress. In the hall,\r\nwere parties of young men, exhibiting their graces in a walk from end to\r\nend: and ladies throwing off their shawls, and displaying the most\r\nsplendid dresses. The President, with some members of his cabinet on\r\neither hand, stood in the middle of the first room, ready to bow to all\r\nthe ladies, and shake hands with all the gentlemen who presented\r\nthemselves. The company then passed on to the fire-place, where stood\r\nthe ladies of the President's family, attended by the Vice-president,\r\nand the Secretary of the Treasury. From this point, the visitors\r\ndispersed themselves through the rooms, chatting in groups in the\r\nBlue-room, or joining the immense promenade in the great East room.\r\nAfter two circuits there, I went back to the reception-room; by far the\r\nmost interesting to an observer. I saw one ambassador after another\r\nenter with his suite; the Judges of the Supreme Court; the majority of\r\nthe members of both Houses of Congress; and intermingled with these, the\r\nplainest farmers, storekeepers, and mechanics, with their primitive\r\nwives and simple daughters. Some looked merry; some looked busy; but\r\nnone bashful. I believe there were three thousand persons present. There\r\nwas one deficiency,--one drawback, as I felt at the time. There were no\r\npersons of colour. Whatever individuals or classes may choose to do\r\nabout selecting their society according to rules of their own making,\r\nhere there should be no distinction. I know the pleas that would be\r\nurged,--the levee being held in a slave district; the presence of\r\nslave-holders from the south; and many others; but such pleas will not\r\nstand before the plain fact that this levee is the appointed means by\r\nwhich citizens of the United States of all degrees may, once in a time,\r\nmeet together, to pay their equal respects to their chief magistrate.\r\nEvery man of colour who is a citizen of the United States has a right to\r\nas free an admission as any other man; and it would be a dignity added\r\nto the White House if such were seen there. It is not to its credit that\r\nthere is any place in the country where its people are more free to meet\r\non equal terms. There is such a place. In the Catholic cathedral in New\r\nOrleans, I saw persons of every shade of colour kneeling on the\r\npavement, without separation or distinction. I would fain have seen also\r\nsome one secular house where, by general consent, all kinds of men might\r\nmeet as brethren. But not even in republican America is there yet such\r\nan one.\r\n\r\nThe Americans possess an advantage in regard to the teaching of manners\r\nwhich they do not yet appreciate. They have before their eyes, in the\r\nmanners of the coloured race, a perpetual caricature of their own\r\nfollies; a mirror of conventionalism from which they can never escape.\r\nThe negroes are the most imitative set of people living. While they are\r\nin a degraded condition, with little principle, little knowledge, little\r\nindependence, they copy the most successfully those things in their\r\nsuperiors which involve the least principle, knowledge, and\r\nindependence; viz. their conventionalisms. They carry their mimicry far\r\nbeyond any which is seen among the menials of the rich in Europe. The\r\nblack footmen of the United States have tiptoe graces, stiff cravats,\r\nand eye-catching flourishes, like the footmen in London: but the\r\nimitation extends into more important matters. As the slaves of the\r\nsouth assume their masters' names and military titles, they assume their\r\nmethods of conducting the courtesies and gaieties of life. I have in my\r\npossession a note of invitation to a ball, written on pink paper with\r\ngilt edges.[24] When the lady invited came to her mistress for the\r\nticket which was necessary to authorise her being out after nine at\r\nnight, she was dressed in satin with muslin over it, satin shoes, and\r\nwhite kid gloves:--but, the satin was faded, the muslin torn: the shoes\r\nwere tied upon the extremities of her splay feet, and the white gloves\r\ndropping in tatters from her dark fingers. She was a caricature, instead\r\nof a fine lady. A friend of mine walked a mile or two in the dusk behind\r\ntwo black men and a woman whom they were courting. He told me that\r\nnothing could be more admirable than the coyness of the lady, and the\r\ncompliments of the gallant and his friend. It could not be very amusing\r\nto those who reflect that holy and constant love, free preference, and\r\nall that makes marriage a blessing instead of a curse, were here out of\r\nthe question: but the resemblance in the mode of courtship to that\r\nadopted by whites, when meditating marriage of a not dissimilar\r\nvirtue,--a marriage of barter,--could not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nEven in their ultimate, funereal courtesies, the coloured race imitate\r\nthe whites. An epitaph on a negro baby at Savannah begins, \"Sweet\r\nblighted lily!\"--They have few customs which are absolutely peculiar.\r\nOne of these is refusing to eat before whites. When we went long\r\nexpeditions, carrying luncheon, or procuring it by the road-side, the\r\nslaves always retired with their share behind trees or large stones, or\r\nother hiding-places.\r\n\r\nThe Americans may be considered secure of good manners generally while\r\nintellect is so reverenced among them as it is, above all other claims\r\nto honour. Whatever follies and frivolities the would-be fashionable\r\nclasses may perpetrate, they will never be able to degrade the national\r\nmanners, or to make themselves the first people in the republic.\r\nIntellect carries all before it in social intercourse, and will continue\r\nto do so. I was struck by the fact that, in country villages, the most\r\nenlightened members of a family may be cultivated as acquaintance,\r\nwithout the rest. They may be invited to a superior party, and the\r\nothers left for an inferior one. As for the cities, Washington, with its\r\nmotley population in time of Session, is an exception to all rules; and\r\nI certainly saw some uncommonly foolish people treated with more\r\nattention, of a temporary kind, than some very wise ones. But in other\r\ncities I am not aware of having seen any great influence possessed by\r\npersons who had not sufficient intellectual desert. A Washington belle\r\nrelated to me the sad story of the death of a young man who fell from a\r\nsmall boat into the Potomac in the night,--it is supposed in his sleep.\r\nShe told where and how his body was found; and what relations he had\r\nleft; and finished with \"he will be much missed at parties.\" Washington\r\nis a place where a young man may be thus mourned: but elsewhere there\r\nwould have been a better reason given, or none at all. In the capitals\r\nof States, men rank according to their supposed intellect. Many mistakes\r\nare made in the estimate; and (far worse) many pernicious allowances are\r\nmade for bad morals, for the sake of the superior intellect: but still\r\nthe taste is a higher one, the gradation a more rational one, than is to\r\nbe found elsewhere: and, where such a taste and a gradation subsist, the\r\nessentials of good manners can never be wanting. It is refreshing to\r\nwitness the village homage paid to the author and the statesman, as to\r\nthe highest of human beings. Whatever the author and the statesman may\r\nbe, the homage is honourable to those who offer it. It is no less\r\nrefreshing in the cities to see how the vainest fops and the most solid\r\ncapitalists readily succumb before men and women who are distinguished\r\nfor nothing but their minds. The worst of manners,--those which fly off\r\nthe furthest from nature, and do the most violence to the\r\naffections--are such as arise from a surpassing regard to things outward\r\nand shadowy: the best are those which manifest a pursuit of things\r\ninvisible and real. The Americans are better mannered than others, in as\r\nfar as they reverence intellect more than wealth and fashion. It remains\r\nfor them to enlarge their notions, and exalt their tests of intellect,\r\ntill it shall identify itself with morals. National manners, national\r\nobservances of rank graduated on such a principle would be no subject of\r\ncontroversy, but would command the admiration, and gradually form the\r\ntaste, of the world. I cannot but think that a beginning of this change\r\nis visible in the intercourses of those Americans who have rejected the\r\nprevalent false idea of honour, and in the spirit of love borne witness\r\nto unpopular truths. The freedom, gentleness, and earnestness of the\r\nmanners of such offer a realisation of grace which no conventional\r\ntraining can secure. A southern gentleman was on board a steam-boat,\r\nproceeding from New York to Philadelphia. He engaged in conversation\r\nwith two unknown gentlemen; and soon plunged into the subject of\r\nslavery. He was a slave-holder, and they were abolitionists. With one of\r\nthem, he was peculiarly pleased; and they discussed their subject for a\r\ngreat length of time. He at last addressed the other abolitionist thus:\r\n\"How easy and pleasant it is to argue this matter with such a man as\r\nyour friend! If all you abolitionists were like him, how soon we and you\r\nmight come to an understanding! But you are generally so coarse and\r\nviolent! You are all so like Garrison! Pray give me your friend's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have just spoken it. It is Mr. Garrison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! This gentleman is so mild, so gentlemanly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the captain if it be not Mr. Garrison.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an important point. The captain was asked. This mild, courteous,\r\nsimple, sprightly, gentlemanly person was Garrison.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Channing's Letter to Birney. 1837.\r\n\r\n[21] Godwin's Inquirer.\r\n\r\n[22] Sober Thoughts on the State of the Times. Boston, 1835, p. 27.\r\n\r\n[23] This reminds me of a singular instance of confusion of ideas. The\r\nlandlady of a hotel declared my trumpet to be the best invention she had\r\never seen: better than spectacles. Query, better for what?\r\n\r\n[24] \"Mr. Richard Masey requests the pleasure of Mrs. Miken's, and Miss\r\nArthur's company, on Saturday evening at seven o'clock, in Dr. Smith's\r\nlong brick-store.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\n\r\n     \"The vale best discovereth the hill. There is little friendship in\r\n     the world, and least of all between equals, which was wont to be\r\n     magnified. That that is, is between superior and inferior, whose\r\n     fortunes may comprehend the one the other.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bacon._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a test of civilisation be sought, none can be so sure as the\r\ncondition of that half of society over which the other half has\r\npower,--from the exercise of the right of the strongest. Tried by this\r\ntest, the American civilisation appears to be of a lower order than\r\nmight have been expected from some other symptoms of its social state.\r\nThe Americans have, in the treatment of women, fallen below, not only\r\ntheir own democratic principles, but the practice of some parts of the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nThe unconsciousness of both parties as to the injuries suffered by women\r\nat the hands of those who hold the power is a sufficient proof of the\r\nlow degree of civilisation in this important particular at which they\r\nrest. While woman's intellect is confined, her morals crushed, her\r\nhealth ruined, her weaknesses encouraged, and her strength punished, she\r\nis told that her lot is cast in the paradise of women: and there is no\r\ncountry in the world where there is so much boasting of the\r\n\"chivalrous\" treatment she enjoys. That is to say,--she has the best\r\nplace in stage-coaches: when there are not chairs enough for everybody,\r\nthe gentlemen stand: she hears oratorical flourishes on public occasions\r\nabout wives and home, and apostrophes to woman: her husband's hair\r\nstands on end at the idea of her working, and he toils to indulge her\r\nwith money: she has liberty to get her brain turned by religious\r\nexcitements, that her attention may be diverted from morals, politics,\r\nand philosophy; and, especially, her morals are guarded by the strictest\r\nobservance of propriety in her presence. In short, indulgence is given\r\nher as a substitute for justice. Her case differs from that of the\r\nslave, as to the principle, just so far as this; that the indulgence is\r\nlarge and universal, instead of petty and capricious. In both cases,\r\njustice is denied on no better plea than the right of the strongest. In\r\nboth cases, the acquiescence of the many, and the burning discontent of\r\nthe few, of the oppressed, testify, the one to the actual degradation of\r\nthe class, and the other to its fitness for the enjoyment of human\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe intellect of woman is confined. I met with immediate proof of this.\r\nWithin ten days of my landing, I encountered three outrageous pedants,\r\namong the ladies; and in my progress through the country I met with a\r\ngreater variety and extent of female pedantry than the experience of a\r\nlifetime in Europe would afford. I could fill the remainder of my volume\r\nwith sketches: but I forbear, through respect even for this very\r\npedantry. Where intellect has a fair chance, there is no pedantry, among\r\nmen or women. It is the result of an intellect which cannot be wholly\r\npassive, but must demonstrate some force, and does so through the medium\r\nof narrow morals. Pedantry indicates the first struggle of intellect\r\nwith its restraints; and is therefore a hopeful symptom.\r\n\r\nThe intellect of woman is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of\r\nboth methods of education,--by express teaching, and by the discipline\r\nof circumstance. The former, though prior in the chronology of each\r\nindividual, is a direct consequence of the latter, as regards the whole\r\nof the sex. As women have none of the objects in life for which an\r\nenlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given.\r\nFemale education in America is much what it is in England. There is a\r\nprofession of some things being taught which are supposed necessary\r\nbecause everybody learns them. They serve to fill up time, to occupy\r\nattention harmlessly, to improve conversation, and to make women\r\nsomething like companions to their husbands, and able to teach their\r\nchildren somewhat. But what is given is, for the most part, passively\r\nreceived; and what is obtained is, chiefly, by means of the memory.\r\nThere is rarely or never a careful ordering of influences for the\r\npromotion of clear intellectual activity. Such activity, when it exceeds\r\nthat which is necessary to make the work of the teacher easy, is feared\r\nand repressed. This is natural enough, as long as women are excluded\r\nfrom the objects for which men are trained. While there are natural\r\nrights which women may not use, just claims which are not to be listened\r\nto, large objects which may not be approached, even in imagination,\r\nintellectual activity is dangerous: or, as the phrase is, unfit.\r\nAccordingly, marriage is the only object left open to woman. Philosophy\r\nshe may pursue only fancifully, and under pain of ridicule: science only\r\nas a pastime, and under a similar penalty. Art is declared to be left\r\nopen: but the necessary learning, and, yet more, the indispensable\r\nexperience of reality, are denied to her. Literature is also said to be\r\npermitted: but under what penalties and restrictions? I need only refer\r\nto the last three pages of the review of Miss Sedgwick's last novel in\r\nthe North American Review, to support all that can be said of the\r\ninsolence to which the intellect of women is exposed in America. I am\r\naware that many blush for that article, and disclaim all sympathy with\r\nit: but the bare fact that any man in the country could write it, that\r\nany editor could sanction it, that such an intolerable scoff should be\r\nallowed to find its way to the light, is a sufficient proof of the\r\ndegradation of the sex. Nothing is thus left for women but\r\nmarriage.--Yes; Religion, is the reply.--Religion is a temper, not a\r\npursuit. It is the moral atmosphere in which human beings are to live\r\nand move. Men do not live to breathe: they breathe to live. A German\r\nlady of extraordinary powers and endowments, remarked to me with\r\namazement on all the knowledge of the American women being based on\r\ntheology. She observed that in her own country theology had its turn\r\nwith other sciences, as a pursuit: but nowhere, but with the American\r\nwomen, had she known it make the foundation of all other knowledge. Even\r\nwhile thus complaining, this lady stated the case too favourably.\r\nAmerican women have not the requisites for the study of theology. The\r\ndifference between theology and religion, the science and the temper, is\r\nyet scarcely known among them. It is religion which they pursue as an\r\noccupation; and hence its small results upon the conduct, as well as\r\nupon the intellect. We are driven back upon marriage as the only\r\nappointed object in life: and upon the conviction that the sum and\r\nsubstance of female education in America, as in England, is training\r\nwomen to consider marriage as the sole object in life, and to pretend\r\nthat they do not think so.\r\n\r\nThe morals of women are crushed. If there be any human power and\r\nbusiness and privilege which is absolutely universal, it is the\r\ndiscovery and adoption of the principle and laws of duty. As every\r\nindividual, whether man or woman, has a reason and a conscience, this is\r\na work which each is thereby authorised to do for him or herself. But it\r\nis not only virtually prohibited to beings who, like the American women,\r\nhave scarcely any objects in life proposed to them; but the whole\r\napparatus of opinion is brought to bear offensively upon individuals\r\namong women who exercise freedom of mind in deciding upon what duty is,\r\nand the methods by which it is to be pursued. There is nothing\r\nextraordinary to the disinterested observer in women being so grieved at\r\nthe case of slaves,--slave wives and mothers, as well as spirit-broken\r\nmen,--as to wish to do what they could for their relief: there is\r\nnothing but what is natural in their being ashamed of the cowardice of\r\nsuch white slaves of the north as are deterred by intimidation from\r\nusing their rights of speech and of the press, in behalf of the\r\nsuffering race, and in their resolving not to do likewise: there is\r\nnothing but what is justifiable in their using their moral freedom, each\r\nfor herself, in neglect of the threats of punishment: yet there were no\r\nbounds to the efforts made to crush the actions of women who thus used\r\ntheir human powers in the abolition question, and the convictions of\r\nthose who looked on, and who might possibly be warmed into free action\r\nby the beauty of what they saw. It will be remembered that they were\r\nwomen who asserted the right of meeting and of discussion, on the day\r\nwhen Garrison was mobbed in Boston. Bills were posted about the city on\r\nthis occasion, denouncing these women as casting off the refinement and\r\ndelicacy of their sex: the newspapers, which laud the exertions of\r\nladies in all other charities for the prosecution of which they are\r\nwont to meet and speak, teemed with the most disgusting reproaches and\r\ninsinuations: and the pamphlets which related to the question all\r\npresumed to censure the act of duty which the women had performed in\r\ndeciding upon their duty for themselves.--One lady, of high talents and\r\ncharacter, whose books were very popular before she did a deed greater\r\nthan that of writing any book, in acting upon an unusual conviction of\r\nduty, and becoming an abolitionist, has been almost excommunicated\r\nsince. A family of ladies, whose talents and conscientiousness had\r\nplaced them high in the estimation of society as teachers, have lost all\r\ntheir pupils since they declared their anti-slavery opinions. The\r\nreproach in all the many similar cases that I know is, not that the\r\nladies hold anti-slavery opinions, but that they act upon them. The\r\nincessant outcry about the retiring modesty of the sex proves the\r\nopinion of the censors to be, that fidelity to conscience is\r\ninconsistent with retiring modesty. If it be so, let the modesty\r\nsuccumb. It can be only a false modesty which can be thus endangered. No\r\ndoubt, there were people in Rome who were scandalised at the unseemly\r\nboldness of christian women who stood in the amphitheatre to be torn in\r\npieces for their religion. No doubt there were many gentlemen in the\r\nBritish army who thought it unsuitable to the retiring delicacy of the\r\nsex that the wives and daughters of the revolutionary heroes should be\r\nrevolutionary heroines. But the event has a marvellous efficacy in\r\nmodifying the ultimate sentence. The bold christian women, the brave\r\nAmerican wives and daughters of half a century ago are honoured, while\r\nthe intrepid moralists of the present day, worthy of their grandmothers,\r\nare made the confessors and martyrs of their age.\r\n\r\nI could cite many conversations and incidents to show how the morals of\r\nwomen are crushed: but I can make room for only one. Let it be the\r\nfollowing. A lady, who is considered unusually clear-headed and\r\nsound-hearted where trying questions are not concerned, one day praised\r\nvery highly Dr. Channing's work on Slavery. \"But,\" said she, \"do not you\r\nthink it a pity that so much is said on slavery just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I think it necessary and natural.\"\r\n\r\n\"But people who hold Dr. Channing's belief about a future life, cannot\r\nwell make out the case of the slaves to be so very bad an one. If the\r\npresent life is but a moment in comparison with the eternity to come,\r\ncan it matter so very much how it is spent?\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it strike you about your own children? Would it reconcile you\r\nto their being made slaves, that they could be so only for three-score\r\nyears and ten?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no. But yet it seems as if life would so soon be over.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of their condition at the end of it? How much\r\nwill the purposes of human life have been fulfilled?\"\r\n\r\n\"The slaves will not be punished, you know, for the state they may be\r\nin; for it will be no fault of their own. Their masters will have the\r\nresponsibility; not they.\"\r\n\r\n\"Place the responsibility where you will. Speaking according to your own\r\nbelief, do you think it of no consequence whether a human being enters\r\nupon a future life utterly ignorant and sensualised, or in the likeness\r\nof Dr. Channing, as you described him just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of great consequence, certainly. But then it is no business of ours; of\r\nus women, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you considered yourself a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I do. You will say that Christians should help sufferers, whoever\r\nand wherever they may be. But not women, in all cases, surely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, in your Christianity, do you find the distinction made?\"\r\n\r\nShe could only reply that she thought women should confine themselves to\r\ndoing what could be done at home. I asked her what her christian charity\r\nwould bid her do, if she saw a great boy beating a little one in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"O, I parted two such the other day in the street. It would have been\r\nvery wrong to have passed them by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well: if there are a thousand strong men in the south beating ten\r\nthousand weak slaves, and you can possibly help to stop the beating by a\r\ndeclaration of your opinion upon it, does not your christian duty oblige\r\nyou to make such a declaration, whether you are man or woman? What in\r\nthe world has your womanhood to do with it?\"\r\n\r\nHow fearfully the morals of woman are crushed, appears from the\r\nprevalent persuasion that there are virtues which are peculiarly\r\nmasculine, and others which are peculiarly feminine. It is amazing that\r\na society which makes a most emphatic profession of its Christianity,\r\nshould almost universally entertain such a fallacy: and not see that, in\r\nthe case they suppose, instead of the character of Christ being the\r\nmeeting point of all virtues, there would have been a separate gospel\r\nfor women, and a second company of agents for its diffusion. It is not\r\nonly that masculine and feminine employments are supposed to be properly\r\ndifferent. No one in the world, I believe, questions this. But it is\r\nactually supposed that what are called the hardy virtues are more\r\nappropriate to men, and the gentler to women. As all virtues nourish\r\neach other, and can no otherwise be nourished, the consequence of the\r\nadmitted fallacy is that men are, after all, not nearly so brave as they\r\nought to be; nor women so gentle. But what is the manly character till\r\nit be gentle? The very word magnanimity cannot be thought of in relation\r\nto it till it becomes mild--Christ-like. Again, what can a woman be, or\r\ndo, without bravery? Has she not to struggle with the toils and\r\ndifficulties which follow upon the mere possession of a mind? Must she\r\nnot face physical and moral pain--physical and moral danger? Is there a\r\nday of her life in which there are not conflicts wherein no one can help\r\nher--perilous work to be done, in which she can have neither sympathy\r\nnor aid? Let her lean upon man as much as he will, how much is it that\r\nhe can do for her?--from how much can he protect her? From a few\r\nphysical perils, and from a very few social evils. This is all. Over the\r\nmoral world he has no control, except on his own account; and it is the\r\nmoral life of human beings which is all in all. He can neither secure\r\nany woman from pain and grief, nor rescue her from the strife of\r\nemotions, nor prevent the film of life from cracking under her feet with\r\nevery step she treads, nor hide from her the abyss which is beneath, nor\r\nsave her from sinking into it at last alone. While it is so, while woman\r\nis human, men should beware how they deprive her of any of the strength\r\nwhich is all needed for the strife and burden of humanity. Let them\r\nbeware how they put her off her watch and defence, by promises which\r\nthey cannot fulfil;--promises of a guardianship which can arise only\r\nfrom within; of support which can be derived only from the freest moral\r\naction,--from the self-reliance which can be generated by no other\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, how does society get on,--what does it do? for it\r\nacts on the supposition of there being masculine and feminine\r\nvirtues,--upon the fallacy just exposed.\r\n\r\nIt does so; and the consequences are what might be looked for. Men are\r\nungentle, tyrannical. They abuse the right of the strongest, however\r\nthey may veil the abuse with indulgence. They want the magnanimity to\r\ndiscern woman's human rights; and they crush her morals rather than\r\nallow them. Women are, as might be anticipated, weak, ignorant and\r\nsubservient, in as far as they exchange self-reliance for reliance on\r\nanything out of themselves. Those who will not submit to such a\r\nsuspension of their moral functions, (for the work of self-perfection\r\nremains to be done, sooner or later,) have to suffer for their\r\nallegiance to duty. They have all the need of bravery that the few\r\nheroic men who assert the highest rights of women have of gentleness, to\r\nguard them from the encroachment to which power, custom, and education,\r\nincessantly conduce.\r\n\r\nSuch brave women and such just men there are in the United States,\r\nscattered among the multitude, whose false apprehension of rights leads\r\nto an enormous failure of duties. There are enough of such to commend\r\nthe true understanding and practice to the simplest minds and most\r\nfaithful hearts of the community, under whose testimony the right\r\nprinciple will spread and flourish. If it were not for the external\r\nprosperity of the country, the injured half of its society would\r\nprobably obtain justice sooner than in any country of Europe. But the\r\nprosperity of America is a circumstance unfavourable to its women. It\r\nwill be long before they are put to the proof as to what they are\r\ncapable of thinking and doing: a proof to which hundreds, perhaps\r\nthousands of Englishwomen have been put by adversity, and the result of\r\nwhich is a remarkable improvement in their social condition, even within\r\nthe space of ten years. Persecution for opinion, punishment for all\r\nmanifestations of intellectual and moral strength, are still as common\r\nas women who have opinions and who manifest strength: but some things\r\nare easy, and many are possible of achievement, to women of ordinary\r\npowers, which it would have required genius to accomplish but a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nIf there is any country on earth where the course of true love may be\r\nexpected to run smooth, it is America. It is a country where all can\r\nmarry early, where there need be no anxiety about a worldly provision,\r\nand where the troubles arising from conventional considerations of rank\r\nand connexion ought to be entirely absent. It is difficult for a\r\nstranger to imagine beforehand why all should not love and marry\r\nnaturally and freely, to the prevention of vice out of the marriage\r\nstate, and of the common causes of unhappiness within it. The\r\nanticipations of the stranger are not, however, fulfilled: and they\r\nnever can be while the one sex overbears the other. Marriage is in\r\nAmerica more nearly universal, more safe, more tranquil, more fortunate\r\nthan in England: but it is still subject to the troubles which arise\r\nfrom the inequality of the parties in mind and in occupation. It is more\r\nnearly universal, from the entire prosperity of the country: it is\r\nsafer, from the greater freedom of divorce, and consequent\r\ndiscouragement of swindling, and other vicious marriages: it is more\r\ntranquil and fortunate from the marriage vows being made absolutely\r\nreciprocal; from the arrangements about property being generally far\r\nmore favorable to the wife than in England; and from her not being made,\r\nas in England, to all intents and purposes the property of her husband.\r\nThe outward requisites to happiness are nearly complete, and the\r\ninstitution is purified from the grossest of the scandals which degrade\r\nit in the Old World: but it is still the imperfect institution which it\r\nmust remain while women continue to be ill-educated, passive, and\r\nsubservient: or well-educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance.\r\n\r\nThe institution presents a different aspect in the various parts of the\r\ncountry. I have spoken of the early marriages of silly children in the\r\nsouth and west, where, owing to the disproportion of numbers, every\r\nwoman is married before she well knows how serious a matter human life\r\nis. She has an advantage which very few women elsewhere are allowed: she\r\nhas her own property to manage. It would be a rare sight elsewhere to\r\nsee a woman of twenty-one in her second widowhood, managing her own farm\r\nor plantation; and managing it well, because it had been in her own\r\nhands during her marriage. In Louisiana, and also in Missouri, (and\r\nprobably in other States,) a woman not only has half her husband's\r\nproperty by right at his death, but may always be considered as\r\npossessed of half his gains during his life; having at all times power\r\nto bequeath that amount. The husband interferes much less with his\r\nwife's property in the south, even through her voluntary relinquishment\r\nof it, than is at all usual where the cases of women, having property\r\nduring their marriage are rare. In the southern newspapers,\r\nadvertisements may at any time be seen, running thus:--\"Mrs. A, wife of\r\nMr. A, will dispose of &c. &c.\" When Madame Lalaurie was mobbed in New\r\nOrleans, no one meddled with her husband or his possessions; as he was\r\nno more responsible for her management of her human property than\r\nanybody else. On the whole, the practice seems to be that the weakest\r\nand most ignorant women give up their property to their husbands; the\r\nhusbands of such women being precisely the men most disposed to accept\r\nit: and that the strongest-minded and most conscientious women keep\r\ntheir property, and use their rights; the husbands of such women being\r\nprecisely those who would refuse to deprive their wives of their social\r\nduties and privileges.\r\n\r\nIf this condition of the marriage law should strike any English persons\r\nas a peculiarity, it is well that they should know that it is the\r\nEnglish law which is peculiar, and not that of Louisiana. The English\r\nalone vary from the old Saxon law, that a wife shall possess half, or a\r\nlarge part, of her husband's earnings or makings. It is so in Spanish,\r\nFrench, and Italian law; and probably in German, as the others are\r\nderived thence. Massachusetts has copied the faults of the English law,\r\nin this particular; and I never met with any lawyer, or other citizen\r\nwith whom I conversed on the subject, who was not ashamed of the\r\nbarbarism of the law under which a woman's property goes into her\r\nhusband's hands with herself. A liberal-minded lawyer of Boston told me\r\nthat his advice to testators always is to leave the largest possible\r\namount to the widow, subject to the condition of her leaving it to the\r\nchildren: but that it is with shame that he reflects that any woman\r\nshould owe that to his professional advice which the law should have\r\nsecured to her as a right. I heard a frequent expression of indignation\r\nthat the wife, the friend and helper of many years, should be portioned\r\noff with a legacy, like a salaried domestic, instead of having her\r\nhusband's affairs come legally, as they would naturally, into her hands.\r\nIn Rhode Island, a widow is entitled to one-third of her husband's\r\nproperty: and, on the sale of any estate of his during his life, she is\r\nexamined, in the absence of the husband, as to her will with regard to\r\nher own proportion of it. There is some of the apparatus of female\r\nindependence in the country. It will be most interesting to observe to\r\nwhat uses it is put, whenever the restraints of education and opinion to\r\nwhich women are subject, shall be so far relaxed as to leave them\r\nmorally free.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that divorce is more easily obtained in the United\r\nStates than in England. In no country, I believe, are the marriage laws\r\nso iniquitous as in England, and the conjugal relation, in consequence,\r\nso impaired. Whatever may be thought of the principles which are to\r\nenter into laws of divorce, whether it be held that pleas for divorce\r\nshould be one, (as narrow interpreters of the New Testament would have\r\nit;) or two, (as the law of England has it;) or several, (as the\r\nContinental and United States' laws in many instances allow,) nobody, I\r\nbelieve, defends the arrangement by which, in England, divorce is\r\nobtainable only by the very rich. The barbarism of granting that as a\r\nprivilege to the extremely wealthy, to which money bears no relation\r\nwhatever, and in which all married persons whatever have an equal\r\ninterest, needs no exposure beyond the mere statement of the fact. It\r\nwill be seen at a glance how such an arrangement tends to vitiate\r\nmarriage: how it offers impunity to adventurers, and encouragement to\r\nevery kind of mercenary marriages: how absolute is its oppression of the\r\ninjured party: and how, by vitiating marriage, it originates and\r\naggravates licentiousness to an incalculable extent. To England alone\r\nbelongs the disgrace of such a method of legislation. I believe that,\r\nwhile there is little to be said for the legislation of any part of the\r\nworld on this head, it is nowhere so vicious as in England.\r\n\r\nOf the American States, I believe New York approaches nearest to England\r\nin its laws of divorce. It is less rigid, in as far as that more is\r\ncomprehended under the term \"cruelty.\" The husband is supposed to be\r\nliable to cruelty from the wife, as well as the wife from the husband.\r\nThere is no practical distinction made between rich and poor by the\r\nprocess being rendered expensive: and the cause is more easily resumable\r\nafter a reconciliation of the parties. In Massachusetts, the term\r\n\"cruelty\" is made so comprehensive, and the mode of sustaining the plea\r\nis so considerately devised, that divorces are obtainable with peculiar\r\nease. The natural consequence follows: such a thing is never heard of. A\r\nlong-established and very eminent lawyer of Boston told me that he had\r\nknown of only one in all his experience. Thus it is wherever the law is\r\nrelaxed, and, _cæteris paribus_, in proportion to its relaxation: for\r\nthe obvious reason, that the protection offered by law to the injured\r\nparty causes marriages to be entered into with fewer risks, and the\r\nconjugal relation carried on with more equality. Retribution is known to\r\nimpend over violations of conjugal duty. When I was in North Carolina,\r\nthe wife of a gamester there obtained a divorce without the slightest\r\ndifficulty. When she had brought evidence of the danger to herself and\r\nher children,--danger pecuniary and moral,--from her husband's gambling\r\nhabits, the bill passed both Houses without a dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the sole business which legislation has with marriage\r\nis with the arrangement of property; to guard the reciprocal rights of\r\nthe children of the marriage and the community. There is no further\r\npretence for the interference of the law, in any way. An advance towards\r\nthe recognition of the true principle of legislative interference in\r\nmarriage has been made in England, in the new law in which the agreement\r\nof marriage is made a civil contract, leaving the religious obligation\r\nto the conscience and taste of the parties. It will be probably next\r\nperceived that if the civil obligation is fulfilled, if the children of\r\nthe marriage are legally and satisfactorily provided for by the parties,\r\nwithout the assistance of the legislature, the legislature has, in\r\nprinciple, nothing more to do with the matter. This principle has been\r\nacted upon in the marriage arrangements of Zurich, with the best effects\r\nupon the morals of the conjugal relation. The parties there are married\r\nby a form; and have liberty to divorce themselves without any appeal to\r\nlaw, on showing that they have legally provided for the children of the\r\nmarriage. There was some previous alarm about the effect upon morals of\r\nthe removal of such important legal restrictions: but the event\r\njustified the confidence of those who proceeded on the conviction that\r\nthe laws of human affection, when not tampered with, are more sacred and\r\nbinding than those of any legislature that ever sat in council. There\r\nwas some levity at first, chiefly on the part of those who were\r\nsuffering under the old system: but the morals of the society soon\r\nbecame, and have since remained, peculiarly pure.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed in America, particularly in New England, that the morals\r\nof society there are peculiarly pure. I am grieved to doubt the fact:\r\nbut I do doubt it. Nothing like a comparison between one country and\r\nanother in different circumstances can be instituted: nor would any one\r\ndesire to enter upon such a comparison. The bottomless vice, the\r\nall-pervading corruption of European society cannot, by possibility, be\r\nyet paralleled in America: but neither is it true that any outward\r\nprosperity, any arrangement of circumstances, can keep a society pure\r\nwhile there is corruption in its social methods, and among its\r\nprinciples of individual action. Even in America, where every young man\r\nmay, if he chooses, marry at twenty-one, and appropriate all the best\r\ncomforts of domestic life,--even here there is vice. Men do not choose\r\nto marry early, because they have learned to think other things of more\r\nimportance than the best comforts of domestic life. A gentleman of\r\nMassachusetts, who knows life and the value of most things in it, spoke\r\nto me with deep concern of the alteration in manners which is going on:\r\nof the increase of bachelors, and of mercenary marriages; and of the\r\nfearful consequences. It is too soon for America to be following the old\r\nworld in its ways. In the old world, the necessity of thinking of a\r\nmaintenance before thinking of a wife has led to requiring a certain\r\nstyle of living before taking a wife; and then, alas! to taking a wife\r\nfor the sake of securing a certain style of living. That this species of\r\ncorruption is already spreading in the new world is beyond a doubt;--in\r\nthe cities, where the people who live for wealth and for opinion\r\ncongregate.\r\n\r\nI was struck with the great number of New England women whom I saw\r\nmarried to men old enough to be their fathers. One instance which\r\nperplexed me exceedingly, on my entrance into the country, was explained\r\nvery little to my satisfaction. The girl had been engaged to a young man\r\nwhom she was attached to: her mother broke off the engagement, and\r\nmarried her to a rich old man. This story was a real shock to me; so\r\npersuaded had I been that in America, at least, one might escape from\r\nthe disgusting spectacle of mercenary marriages. But I saw only too\r\nmany instances afterwards. The practice was ascribed to the\r\noften-mentioned fact of the young men migrating westwards in large\r\nnumbers, leaving those who should be their wives to marry widowers of\r\ndouble their age. The Auld Robin Gray story is a frequently enacted\r\ntragedy here: and one of the worst symptoms that struck me was, that\r\nthere was usually a demand upon my sympathy in such cases. I have no\r\nsympathy for those who, under any pressure of circumstances, sacrifice\r\ntheir heart's-love for legal prostitution; and no environment of beauty\r\nor sentiment can deprive the fact of its coarseness: and least of all\r\ncould I sympathise with women who set the example of marrying for an\r\nestablishment in a new country, where, if anywhere, the conjugal\r\nrelation should be found in its purity.\r\n\r\nThe unavoidable consequence of such a mode of marrying is, that the\r\nsanctity of marriage is impaired, and that vice succeeds. Any one must\r\nsee at a glance that if men and women marry those whom they do not love,\r\nthey must love those whom they do not marry. There are sad tales in\r\ncountry villages, here and there, which attest this; and yet more in\r\ntowns, in a rank of society where such things are seldom or never heard\r\nof in England. I rather think that married life is immeasurably purer in\r\nAmerica than in England: but that there is not otherwise much\r\nsuperiority to boast of. I can only say, that I unavoidably knew of more\r\ncases of lapse in highly respectable families in one State than ever\r\ncame to my knowledge at home; and that they were got over with a\r\ndisgrace far more temporary and superficial than they could have been\r\nvisited with in England. I am aware that in Europe the victims are\r\nchosen, with deliberate selfishness, from classes which cannot make\r\nknown their perils and their injuries; while in America, happily, no\r\nsuch class exists. I am aware that this destroys all possibility of a\r\ncomparison: but the fact remains, that the morals of American society\r\nare less pure than they assume to be. If the common boast be meant to\r\napply to the rural population, at least let it not be made, either in\r\npious gratitude, or patriotic conceit, by the aristocratic city classes,\r\nwho, by introducing the practice of mercenary marriages, have rendered\r\nthemselves responsible for whatever dreadful consequences may ensue.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate and very strong impression on the mind of a stranger,\r\npondering the morals of society in America, is that human nature is much\r\nthe same everywhere, whatever may be its environment of riches or\r\npoverty; and that it is justice to the human nature, and not improvement\r\nin fortunes, which must be looked to as the promise of a better time.\r\nLaws and customs may be creative of vice; and should be therefore\r\nperpetually under process of observation and correction: but laws and\r\ncustoms cannot be creative of virtue: they may encourage and help to\r\npreserve it; but they cannot originate it. In the present case, the\r\ncourse to be pursued is to exalt the aims, and strengthen the\r\nself-discipline of the whole of society, by each one being as good as he\r\ncan make himself, and relying on his own efforts after self-perfection\r\nrather than on any fortunate arrangements of outward social\r\ncircumstances. Women, especially, should be allowed the use and benefit\r\nof whatever native strength their Maker has seen fit to give them. It is\r\nessential to the virtue of society that they should be allowed the\r\nfreest moral action, unfettered by ignorance, and unintimidated by\r\nauthority: for it is unquestioned and unquestionable that if women were\r\nnot weak, men could not be wicked: that if women were bravely pure,\r\nthere must be an end to the dastardly tyranny of licentiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of American women have home and its affairs,\r\nwherewith to occupy themselves. Wifely and motherly occupation may be\r\ncalled the sole business of woman there. If she has not that, she has\r\nnothing. The only alternative, as I have said, is making an occupation\r\nof either religion or dissipation; neither of which is fit to be so\r\nused: the one being a state of mind; the other altogether a negation\r\nwhen not taken in alternation with business.\r\n\r\nIt must happen that where all women have only one serious object, many\r\nof them will be unfit for that object. In the United States, as\r\nelsewhere, there are women no more fit to be wives and mothers than to\r\nbe statesmen and generals; no more fit for any responsibility whatever,\r\nthan for the maximum of responsibility. There is no need to describe\r\nsuch: they may be seen everywhere. I allude to them only for the purpose\r\nof mentioning that many of this class shirk some of their labours and\r\ncares, by taking refuge in boarding-houses. It is a circumstance very\r\nunfavourable to the character of some American women, that\r\nboarding-house life has been rendered compulsory by the scarcity of\r\nlabour,--the difficulty of obtaining domestic service. The more I saw of\r\nboarding-house life, the worse I thought of it; though I saw none but\r\nthe best. Indeed, the degrees of merit in such establishments weigh\r\nlittle in the consideration of the evil of their existence at all. In\r\nthe best it is something to be secure of respectable company, of a good\r\ntable, a well-mannered and courteous hostess, and comfort in the private\r\napartments: but the mischiefs of the system throw all these objects into\r\nthe back-ground.\r\n\r\nTo begin with young children. There can be no sufficient command of\r\nproper food for them; nor any security that they will eat it naturally\r\nat the table where fifty persons may be sitting, a dozen obsequious\r\nblacks waiting, and an array of tempting dishes within sight. The child\r\nis in imminent danger of being too shy and frightened to eat at all, or\r\nof becoming greedy to eat too much. Next, it is melancholy to see girls\r\nof twelve years old either slinking down beside their parents, and\r\nblushing painfully as often as any one of fifty strangers looks towards\r\nthem; or boldly staring at all that is going on, and serving themselves,\r\nlike little women of the world. After tea, it is a common practice to\r\nhand the young ladies to the piano, to play and sing to a party,\r\ncomposed chiefly of gentlemen, and brought together on no principle of\r\nselection except mere respectability. Next comes the mischief to the\r\nyoung married ladies, the most numerous class of women found in\r\nboarding-houses. The uncertainty about domestic service is so great, and\r\nthe economy of boarding-house life so tempting to people who have not\r\nprovided themselves with house and furniture, that it is not to be\r\nwondered at that many young married people use the accommodation\r\nprovided. But no sensible husband, who could beforehand become\r\nacquainted with the liabilities incurred, would willingly expose his\r\ndomestic peace to the fearful risk. I saw enough when I saw the\r\nelegantly dressed ladies repair to the windows of the common\r\ndrawing-room, on their husbands' departure to the counting-house, after\r\nbreakfast. There the ladies sit for hours, doing nothing but gossiping\r\nwith one another, with any gentlemen of the house who may happen to\r\nhave no business, and with visitors. It is true that the sober-minded\r\namong the ladies can and do withdraw to their own apartments for the\r\nmorning: but they complain that they cannot settle to regular\r\nemployments as they could in a house of their own. Either they are not\r\ngoing to stay long; or they have not room for their books, or they are\r\nbroken in upon by their acquaintances in the house. The common testimony\r\nis, that little can be done in boarding-houses: and if the more\r\nsober-minded find it so, the fate of the thoughtless, who have no real\r\nbusiness to do, may be easily anticipated. They find a dear friend or\r\ntwo among the boarders, to whom they confide their husbands' secrets. A\r\nwoman who would do this once would do it twice, or as often as she\r\nchanges her boarding-house, and finds a new dear friend in each. I have\r\nbeen assured that there is no end to the difficulties in which gentlemen\r\nhave been involved, both as to their commercial and domestic affairs, by\r\nthe indiscretion of their thoughtless young wives, amidst the idleness\r\nand levities of boarding-house life.--As for the gentlemen, they are\r\nmuch to be pitied. Public meals, a noisy house, confinement to one or\r\ntwo private rooms, with the absence of all gratifications of their own\r\npeculiar convenience and taste, are but a poor solace to the man of\r\nbusiness, after the toils and cares of the day. When to these are added\r\nthe snares to which their wives are exposed, it may be imagined that men\r\nof sense and refinement would rather bear with any domestic\r\ninconvenience from the uncertainty and bad quality of help, than give up\r\nhousekeeping. They would content themselves, if need were, with a bread\r\nand cheese dinner, light their own fire, and let their wives dust the\r\nfurniture a few times in the year, rather than give up privacy, with\r\nits securities. I rather think that the gentlemen generally think and\r\nfeel thus; and that when they break up housekeeping and go to\r\nboarding-houses, it is out of indulgence to the wishes of their wives;\r\nwho, if they were as wise as they should be, would wish it seldomer and\r\nless than they do.\r\n\r\nThe study of the economy of domestic service was a continual amusement\r\nto me. What I saw would fill a volume. Many families are, and have for\r\nyears been, as well off for domestics as any family in England; and I\r\nmust say that among the loudest complainers there were many who, from\r\nfault of either judgment or temper, deserved whatever difficulty they\r\nmet with. This is remarkably the case with English ladies settled in\r\nAmerica. They carry with them habits of command, and expectations of\r\nobedience; and when these are found utterly to fail, they grow afraid of\r\ntheir servants. Even when they have learned the theory that domestic\r\nservice is a matter of contract, an exchange of service for recompense,\r\nthe authority of the employer extending no further than to require the\r\nperformance of the service promised,--when the ladies have learned to\r\nassent in words to this, they are still apt to be annoyed at things\r\nwhich in no way concern them. If one domestic chooses to wait at table\r\nwith no cap over her scanty chevelure, and in spectacles,--if another\r\ngoes to church on Sunday morning, dressed exactly like her mistress, the\r\nlady is in no way answerable for the bad taste of her domestics. But\r\nEnglish residents often cannot learn to acquiesce in these things; nor\r\nin the servants doing their work in their own way; nor in their dividing\r\ntheir time as they please between their mistress's work and their own.\r\nThe consequence is, that they soon find it impossible to get American\r\nhelp at all, and they are consigned to the tender mercies of the low\r\nIrish; and every one knows what kind of servants they commonly are. Some\r\nfew of them are the best domestics in America: those who know how to\r\nvalue a respectable home, a steady sufficient income, the honour of\r\nbeing trusted, and the security of valuable friends for life: but too\r\nmany of them are unsettled, reckless, slovenly; some dishonest, and some\r\nintemperate.\r\n\r\nThe most fortunate housekeepers I found to be those who acted the most\r\nstrenuously on principles of justice and kindness. Such housekeepers are\r\ncareful, in the first place, that no part of the mutual duty shall pass\r\nunexplained; no opening be left for future dispute that can be avoided.\r\nThe candidate is not only informed precisely what the work is, and shown\r\nthe accommodations of the house, but consulted with about cases where\r\nthe convenience of the two parties may clash. For instance, the employer\r\nstipulates to be informed some hours before, when her domestic intends\r\nto go out; and that such going out shall never take place when there is\r\ncompany. In return, she yields all she can to the wishes of her domestic\r\nabout recreation, receiving the visits of her family, &c. Where a\r\ncomplete mutual understanding is arrived at, there is the best chance of\r\nthe terms of the contract being faithfully adhered to, and liberally\r\nconstrued, on both sides: and I have seen instances of the parties\r\nhaving lived together in friendship and contentment for five, seven,\r\neleven, and fourteen years.[25] Others, again, I have seen who, without\r\nfault of their own, have changed their servants three times in a\r\nfortnight. Some, too, I have observed who will certainly never be\r\ncomfortably settled, unless they can be taught the first principles of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nMany ladies, in the country especially, take little girls to train;\r\nhaving them bound to a certain term of service. In such a case, the girl\r\nis taken at about eleven years old, and bound to remain till she is\r\neighteen. Her mistress engages to clothe her; to give her\r\nSunday-schooling, and a certain amount of weekday schooling in the year;\r\nand to present her at the end of the term (except in case of bad\r\nbehaviour) with fifty dollars, or a cow, or some equivalent. Under a\r\ngood mistress, this is an excellent bargain for the girl; but mistresses\r\ncomplain that as soon as the girls become really serviceable, by the\r\ntime they are fourteen or fifteen, they begin to grow restless, having\r\nusually abundance of kind friends to tell them what good wages they\r\nmight get if they were free.\r\n\r\nIn several abodes in which I resided for a longer or shorter time, the\r\nroutine of the house was as easy and agreeable as any Englishman's;\r\nelsewhere, the accounts of domestic difficulties were both edifying and\r\namusing. At first, I heard but little of such things; there being a\r\nprevalent idea in America that English ladies concern themselves very\r\nlittle about household affairs. This injurious misapprehension the\r\nladies of England owe, with many others, to the fashionable novels which\r\ndeluge the country from New York to beyond the Mississippi. Though the\r\nAmericans repeat and believe that these books are false pictures of\r\nmanners, they cannot be wholly upon their guard against impressions\r\nderived from them. Too many of them involuntarily image to themselves\r\nthe ladies of England as like the duchesses and countesses of those low\r\nbooks: and can scarcely believe that the wives of merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and shopkeepers, and of the greater number of\r\nprofessional men, buy their own provision, keep household accounts, look\r\nto the making and mending, the baking, making of preserves, &c., and\r\nsometimes cook, with their own hands, any dish of which their husbands\r\nmay be fond. When it was found, from my revelations, that English and\r\nAmerican ladies have, after all, much the same sort of things to do, the\r\nreal state of household economy was laid open to me.\r\n\r\nAll American ladies should know how to clear-starch and iron: how to\r\nkeep plate and glass: how to cook dainties: and, if they understand the\r\nmaking of bread and soup likewise, so much the better. The gentlemen\r\nusually charge themselves with the business of marketing; which is very\r\nfair. A lady, highly accomplished and very literary, told me that she\r\nhad lately been left entirely without help, in a country village where\r\nthere was little hope of being speedily able to procure any. She and her\r\ndaughter made the bread, for six weeks, and entirely kept the house,\r\nwhich might vie with any nobleman's for true luxury; perfect sufficiency\r\nand neatness. She mentioned one good result from the necessity: that she\r\nshould never again put up with bad bread. She could now testify that\r\nbread might always be good, notwithstanding changes of weather, and all\r\nthe excuses commonly given. I heard an anecdote from this lady which\r\nstruck me. She was in the habit of employing, when she wanted extra\r\nhelp, a poor woman of colour, to do kitchen-work. The domestics had\r\nalways appeared on perfectly good terms with this woman till, one day,\r\nwhen there was to be an evening party, the upper domestic declined\r\nwaiting on the company; giving as a reason that she was offended at\r\nbeing required to sit down to table with the coloured woman. Her\r\nmistress gently rebuked her pride, saying \"If you are above waiting on\r\nmy company, my family are not. You will see my daughter carry the\r\ntea-tray, and my niece the cake.\" The girl repented, and besought to be\r\nallowed to wait; but her assistance was declined; at which she cried\r\nheartily. The next day, she was very humble, and her mistress reasoned\r\nwith her, quite successfully. The lady made one concession in silence.\r\nShe had the coloured woman come after dinner, instead of before.\r\n\r\nA country lady travelled thirty miles to a town where she thought she\r\nmight intercept some Irish, coming down from Canada into the States, and\r\nsupply herself with domestics from among them. She engaged to send them\r\nthirty miles to confession, twice a year, if they would live with\r\nher.--Another country lady told me that her family suffered from want of\r\nwater, because the man objected to bring it. The maids fetched it; and\r\neven the children, in their little cans. The man was sturdy on the\r\npoint, and she could not dismiss him for such a reason, he was such a\r\nvaluable servant; though he could not drive, from having only one eye,\r\nand always got drunk when his work was done. The same lady had her house\r\npretty well kept, by dint of superintending everything herself: but,\r\nwhen she wanted her rooms papered, she thought she might leave that kind\r\nof work to the artist who undertook it. When it was done, she was\r\nsummoned to look at it, and called upon to admire the way in which the\r\nman had \"made every crease show.\" He had spent his ingenuity in\r\ncontriving that the pattern should not join in any two strips.\r\n\r\nThe mother of a young bride of my acquaintance flattered herself that\r\nshe had graced her daughter's new house, during the wedding journey,\r\nwith two exemplary domestics. The day previous to the bride's return,\r\nbefore the women had seen either master or mistress, they gave notice\r\nthat they were going away directly, in consequence of the receipt of\r\nsome family news which had changed their plans. They were prevailed upon\r\nto stay for a week, when they persisted in going, though no successors\r\nhad been obtained, and their young mistress was to receive her company\r\nthe next day. What made the matter desperate was that the bride knew\r\nnothing of housekeeping. She made them cook as much provision, to be\r\neaten cold, as would possibly keep; and when they had closed the door\r\nbehind them, sat down and cried for a whole hour. How she got out of her\r\ntroubles, I forget: but she was in excellent spirits when she told me\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\nMany anecdotes are current about the manners of the young people who\r\ncome down from the retired parts of the country to domestic service in\r\nBoston. A simple country girl obeyed her instructions exactly about\r\nputting the dinner upon the table, and then summoning the family. But\r\nthey delayed a few minutes, from some cause; and when they entered the\r\ndining-room, found the domestic seated and eating. She had helped\r\nherself from a fowl, thinking that \"the folk were so long a-coming, the\r\nthings would get cold.\" A young man from Vermont was hired by a family\r\nwho were in extreme want of a footman. He was a most friendly personage,\r\nas willing as he was free and easy; but he knew nothing of life out of a\r\nsmall farm-house. An evening or two after his arrival, there was a large\r\nparty at the house. His mistress strove to impress upon him that all he\r\nhad to do at tea-time was to follow, with the sugar and cream, the\r\nwaiter who carried the tea; to see that every one had cream and sugar;\r\nand to hold his tongue. He did his part with an earnest face, stepping\r\nindustriously from guest to guest. When he had made the circuit, and\r\nreached the door, a doubt struck him whether a group in the furthest\r\npart of the room had had the benefit of his attentions. He raised\r\nhimself on his toes with, \"I'll ask;\" and shouted over the heads of the\r\ncompany, \"I say, how are ye off for sweetenin' in that ere corner?\"\r\n\r\nThese extreme cases sound ridiculously and uncomfortably enough: but it\r\nmust be remembered that they are extreme cases. For my own part, I had\r\nrather suffer any inconvenience from having to work occasionally in\r\nchambers and kitchen, and from having little hospitable designs\r\nfrustrated, than witness the subservience in which the menial class is\r\nheld in Europe. In England, servants have been so long accustomed to\r\nthis subservience; it is so completely the established custom for the\r\nmistress to regulate their manners, their clothes, their intercourse\r\nwith their friends, and many other things which they ought to manage for\r\nthemselves, that it has become difficult to treat them any better.\r\nMistresses who abstain from such regulation find that they are spoiling\r\ntheir servants; and heads of families who would make friends of their\r\ndomestics find them little fitted to reciprocate the duty. In America it\r\nis otherwise: and may it ever be so! All but those who care for their\r\nselfish gratification more than for the welfare of those about them will\r\nbe glad to have intelligent and disinterested friends in the domestics\r\nwhom they may be able to attach, though there may be difficulty at first\r\nin retaining them; and some eccentricities of manner and dress may\r\nremain to be borne with.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasures of travelling through a democratic country is the\r\nseeing no liveries. No such badge of menial service is to be met with\r\nthroughout the States, except in the houses of the foreign ambassadors\r\nat Washington. Of how much higher a character American domestic service\r\nis than any which would endure to be distinguished by a badge, the\r\nfollowing instance will show. I spent an evening at the house of the\r\npresident of Harvard University. The party was waited on at tea by a\r\ndomestic of the president's, who is also Major of the Horse. On cavalry\r\ndays, when guests are invited to dine with the regiment, the major, in\r\nhis regimentals, takes the head of the table, and has the president on\r\nhis right hand. He plays the host as freely as if no other relation\r\nexisted between them. The toasts being all transacted, he goes home,\r\ndoffs his regimentals, and waits on the president's guests at tea.\r\n\r\nAs for the occupations with which American ladies fill up their leisure;\r\nwhat has been already said will show that there is no great weight or\r\ndiversity of occupation. Many are largely engaged in charities, doing\r\ngood or harm according to the enlightenment of mind which is carried to\r\nthe work. In New England, a vast deal of time is spent in attending\r\npreachings, and other religious meetings: and in paying visits, for\r\nreligious purposes, to the poor and sorrowful. The same results follow\r\nfrom this practice that may be witnessed wherever it is much pursued. In\r\nas far as sympathy is kept up, and acquaintanceship between different\r\nclasses in society is occasioned, the practice is good. In as far as it\r\nunsettles the minds of the visitors, encourages a false craving for\r\nreligious excitement, tempts to spiritual interference on the one hand,\r\nand cant on the other, and humours or oppresses those who need such\r\noffices least, while it alienates those who want them most, the practice\r\nis bad. I am disposed to think that much good is done, and much harm:\r\nand that, whenever women have a greater charge of indispensable business\r\non their hands, so as to do good and reciprocate religious sympathy by\r\nlaying hold of opportunities, instead of by making occupation, more than\r\nthe present good will be done, without any of the harm.\r\n\r\nAll American ladies are more or less literary: and some are so to\r\nexcellent purpose: to the saving of their minds from vacuity. Readers\r\nare plentiful: thinkers are rare. Minds are of a very passive character:\r\nand it follows that languages are much cultivated. If ever a woman was\r\npointed out to me as distinguished for information, I might be sure\r\nbeforehand that she was a linguist. I met with a great number of ladies\r\nwho read Latin; some Greek; some Hebrew; some German. With the exception\r\nof the last, the learning did not seem to be of much use to them, except\r\nas a harmless exercise. I met with more intellectual activity, more\r\ngeneral power, among many ladies who gave little time to books, than\r\namong those who are distinguished as being literary. I did not meet with\r\na good artist among all the ladies in the States. I never had the\r\npleasure of seeing a good drawing, except in one instance; or, except in\r\ntwo, of hearing good music. The entire failure of all attempts to draw\r\nis still a mystery to me. The attempts are incessant; but the results\r\nare below criticism. Natural philosophy is not pursued to any extent by\r\nwomen. There is some pretension to mental and moral philosophy; but the\r\nless that is said on that head the better.\r\n\r\nThis is a sad account of things. It may tempt some to ask 'what then are\r\nthe American women?' They are better educated by Providence than by men.\r\nThe lot of humanity is theirs: they have labour, probation, joy, and\r\nsorrow. They are good wives; and, under the teaching of nature, good\r\nmothers. They have, within the range of their activity, good sense, good\r\ntemper, and good manners. Their beauty is very remarkable; and, I think,\r\ntheir wit no less. Their charity is overflowing, if it were but more\r\nenlightened: and it may be supposed that they could not exist without\r\nreligion. It appears to superabound; but it is not usually of a healthy\r\ncharacter. It may seem harsh to say this: but is it not the fact that\r\nreligion emanates from the nature, from the moral state of the\r\nindividual? Is it not therefore true that unless the nature be\r\ncompletely exercised, the moral state harmonised, the religion cannot be\r\nhealthy?\r\n\r\nOne consequence, mournful and injurious, of the 'chivalrous' taste and\r\ntemper of a country with regard to its women is that it is difficult,\r\nwhere it is not impossible, for women to earn their bread. Where it is a\r\nboast that women do not labour, the encouragement and rewards of labour\r\nare not provided. It is so in America. In some parts, there are now so\r\nmany women dependent on their own exertions for a maintenance, that the\r\nevil will give way before the force of circumstances. In the meantime,\r\nthe lot of poor women is sad. Before the opening of the factories, there\r\nwere but three resources; teaching, needle-work, and keeping\r\nboarding-houses or hotels. Now, there are the mills; and women are\r\nemployed in printing-offices; as compositors, as well as folders and\r\nstitchers.\r\n\r\nI dare not trust myself to do more than touch on this topic. There would\r\nbe little use in dwelling upon it; for the mischief lies in the system\r\nby which women are depressed, so as to have the greater number of\r\nobjects of pursuit placed beyond their reach, more than in any minor\r\narrangements which might be rectified by an exposure of particular\r\nevils. I would only ask of philanthropists of all countries to inquire\r\nof physicians what is the state of health of sempstresses; and to judge\r\nthence whether it is not inconsistent with common humanity that women\r\nshould depend for bread upon such employment. Let them inquire what is\r\nthe recompense of this kind of labour, and then wonder if they can that\r\nthe pleasures of the licentious are chiefly supplied from that class.\r\nLet them reverence the strength of such as keep their virtue, when the\r\ntoil which they know is slowly and surely destroying them will barely\r\nafford them bread, while the wages of sin are luxury and idleness.\r\nDuring the present interval between the feudal age and the coming time,\r\nwhen life and its occupations will be freely thrown open to women as to\r\nmen, the condition of the female working classes is such that if its\r\nsufferings were but made known, emotions of horror and shame would\r\ntremble through the whole of society.\r\n\r\nFor women who shrink from the lot of the needlewoman,--almost equally\r\ndreadful, from the fashionable milliner down to the humble\r\nstocking-darner,--for those who shrink through pride, or fear of\r\nsickness, poverty, or temptation, there is little resource but\r\npretension to teach. What office is there which involves more\r\nresponsibility, which requires more qualifications, and which ought,\r\ntherefore, to be more honourable, than that of teaching? What work is\r\nthere for which a decided bent, not to say a genius, is more requisite?\r\nYet are governesses furnished, in America as elsewhere, from among those\r\nwho teach because they want bread; and who certainly would not teach for\r\nany other reason. Teaching and training children is, to a few, a very\r\nfew, a delightful employment, notwithstanding all its toils and cares.\r\nExcept to these few it is irksome; and, when accompanied with poverty\r\nand mortification, intolerable. Let philanthropists inquire into the\r\nproportion of governesses among the inmates of lunatic asylums. The\r\nanswer to this question will be found to involve a world of rebuke and\r\ninstruction. What can be the condition of the sex when such an\r\noccupation is overcrowded with candidates, qualified and unqualified?\r\nWhat is to be hoped from the generation of children confided to the\r\ncares of a class, conscientious perhaps beyond most, but reluctant,\r\nharassed, and depressed?\r\n\r\nThe most accomplished governesses in the United States may obtain 600\r\ndollars a-year in the families of southern planters; provided they will\r\npromise to teach everything. In the north they are paid less; and in\r\nneither case, is there a possibility of making provision for sickness\r\nand old age. Ladies who fully deserve the confidence of society may\r\nrealise an independence in a few years by school-keeping in the north:\r\nbut, on the whole, the scanty reward of female labour in America remains\r\nthe reproach to the country which its philanthropists have for some\r\nyears proclaimed it to be. I hope they will persevere in their\r\nproclamation, though special methods of charity will not avail to cure\r\nthe evil. It lies deep; it lies in the subordination of the sex: and\r\nupon this the exposures and remonstrances of philanthropists may\r\nultimately succeed in fixing the attention of society; particularly of\r\nwomen. The progression or emancipation of any class usually, if not\r\nalways, takes place through the efforts of individuals of that class:\r\nand so it must be here. All women should inform themselves of the\r\ncondition of their sex, and of their own position. It must necessarily\r\nfollow that the noblest of them will, sooner or later, put forth a moral\r\npower which shall prostrate cant, and burst asunder the bonds, (silken\r\nto some, but cold iron to others,) of feudal prejudices and usages. In\r\nthe meantime, is it to be understood that the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence bear no relation to half of the human race?\r\nIf so, what is the ground of the limitation? If not so, how is the\r\nrestricted and dependent state of women to be reconciled with the\r\nproclamation that \"all are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nHEALTH.\r\n\r\nSome popular American writers have lately laid hold of this subject, to\r\nthe great advantage of the society in which they live. Dr. Combe's\r\n\"Principles of Physiology\" has gone through several editions; and I know\r\nthat the demand of society for fresh air and soap and water has\r\nconsiderably increased in consequence. But much remains to be done. In\r\nprivate houses, baths are a rarity. In steam-boats, the accommodations\r\nfor washing are limited in the extreme; and in all but first-rate\r\nhotels, the philosophy of personal cleanliness is certainly not\r\nunderstood. The Creoles of Louisiana are the most satisfactory hosts and\r\nhostesses in this respect, except a few particularly thoughtful people\r\nelsewhere. In the house of a Creole, a guest finds a large pan or tub of\r\nfresh cold water, with soap and towels, placed in a corner of his room,\r\nmorning and night. In such a climate as that of New Orleans, there is no\r\nsafety nor comfort in anything short of a complete ablution, twice a\r\nday. On board steam-boats which have not separate state-rooms, there are\r\nno means of preserving sufficient cleanliness and health. How the ladies\r\nof the cabin can expect to enjoy any degree of vigour and cheerfulness\r\nduring a voyage of four or five days, during which they wash merely\r\ntheir faces and hands, I cannot imagine. It is to be hoped that the\r\nmajority will soon demand that there should be a range of\r\nwashing-closets in all steam-boats whose voyages are longer than\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe common excuse for the deficient activity and lack of fresh air is\r\nthe climate. But this excuse will not avail while there are ladies who\r\ndo preserve their health by walking and riding, and thoroughly\r\nventilating their houses. Any one who knows Stockbridge, and the feats\r\nwhich are there performed by a troop of rosy, graceful girls, and active\r\nwomen, will reject all pleas about the difficulty of getting air and\r\nexercise. It is one of the misfortunes of a new country that its cities\r\nhave environs which are little tempting for walking. It must be\r\nacknowledged that it requires some resolution to go out to walk in\r\nplaces no more tempting than Pennsylvania Avenue, at Washington;\r\nBroadway, New York; or the trim streets of Philadelphia; or even the\r\npretty Common at Boston. But the way to have good country walks provided\r\nis to wish for them. When the whole female society of America shall be\r\nas fond of exercise, as highly-principled with regard to it, as the\r\nStockbridge ladies, the facilities will be furnished. In the meantime,\r\nthere are pretty walks within reach of the whole population, except that\r\nof three or four large cities. Boston is particularly unfortunate in\r\noccupying a promontory, from which it is usually necessary to pass very\r\nlong bridges to the mainland: a passage too bleak to be attempted in\r\nwindy weather, and too exposed to be endurable in a hot sun, without\r\nnecessity. But those who have carriages can easily get transported\r\nbeyond this inconvenience; and for those who have not, there is the\r\nCommon and the Neck.\r\n\r\nThose who wish for health, and know how to seek it, contrive to walk in\r\nsummer very early in the morning; like residents in India. The mornings\r\nof the sultry months are perfectly delicious; and there is no excuse for\r\nneglect of exercise while they last. The autumn weather of the northern\r\nStates is the best of the year, when the hues and airs of paradise seem\r\nshed abroad. The greater number of days in the winter admit of exercise.\r\nThe winds are too cutting to be encountered; but the days of calm clear\r\nfrost might be much better employed in walking than in sleighing. No\r\neulogiums on the sleigh will ever reconcile me to it. I dislike the\r\nmotion, and, after a short time, the jingle of the bells. But the danger\r\nis the prime consideration. Young ladies who dry up their whole frames\r\nin the heat of fires of anthracite coal, never breathing the outward air\r\nbut in going to church, and in stepping in and out of the carriage in\r\ngoing to parties, will once in a time go on a sleighing expedition;\r\nsitting motionless in the open air, with hot bricks to their feet, and\r\ntheir faces in danger of being frost-bitten. If there be pleasure in\r\nsuch frolics, it is too dearly bought by the peril. If the troops of\r\ngirls who would mourn over the abolition of sleighing would but try how\r\nthey like the luxury of daily active exercise in fresh air, they would\r\nfind the exchange well worth making, on the score of pleasure alone.\r\n\r\nThe ladies plead that they have much exercise within doors, about their\r\nhousehold occupations. Except making beds, rubbing tables, and romping\r\nwith children, I know of no household occupations which involve much\r\nexercise. The weariness which some of them occasion, is of a kind which\r\nwould be relieved by walking. And all this does not imply fresh air, of\r\nwhich no one can get enough without going out into it, except in some\r\ncountry residences. It made me sorrowful to see children shut up during\r\nthe winter in houses, heated by anthracite coal up to the temperature of\r\n85°; and to see how pallid and dried the poor little things looked, long\r\nbefore there was a prospect of their speedy release from their\r\nimprisonment. Some, who were let out on fine days, were pretty sure to\r\ncatch cold. Those only seemed heartily to thrive who were kept in rooms\r\nmoderately heated, and vigorously exercised in the open air, on all but\r\nwindy and other unmanageable days. The burning of anthracite coal\r\naffected me unpleasantly, except where an evaporation of water was going\r\non in the room. I suspect that some of the maladies of the country may\r\nbe more or less owing to its use.\r\n\r\nOne proof of the badness of the system of non-exercising, is found in\r\nthe fact that the distortion of the spine is even more common among\r\nwomen in America than in Europe. Physicians who have turned their\r\nattention to this symptom, declare that the difficulty is to find in\r\nboarding-schools a spine that is perfectly straight: and when the period\r\nof growth is completed, a large majority of cases remains where the\r\nweakness is not entirely got over. The posture-making of the United\r\nStates is renowned. Of course there is a cause for a propensity so\r\ngeneral. The languor induced by the climate is that assigned. The ladies\r\nnot being able to use the same freedom as the gentlemen, get rid of\r\ntheir languor as they may; but not as they best may. Instead of sitting\r\nstill all through the hot weather, and all through the cold weather,\r\nthey had better exercise their limbs during some portion of the day, and\r\nlie down during the most sultry hours; and in the winter, avail\r\nthemselves of every opportunity for active employment. If they would do\r\nthis, it is not to be conceived that the next generation would be\r\ndistinguished as the present is for its spare forms and pallid\r\ncomplexions.\r\n\r\nThe apathy on the subject of health was to me no otherwise to be\r\naccounted for than by supposing that the feeling of vigorous health is\r\nalmost unknown. Invalids are remarkably uncomplaining and unalarmed;\r\nand their friends talk of their having \"a weak breast,\" and \"delicate\r\nlungs,\" with little more seriousness than the English use in speaking of\r\na common cold. The numbers of clergymen who had to leave their flocks,\r\nprofessors their chairs, young men and women their country, in pursuit\r\nof health, made me melancholy sometimes when the friends and neighbours\r\ntook it calmly as the commonest of events. As I am pretty confident that\r\na remedy might be found in more judicious management, this acquiescence\r\nstrikes me as being by far too Mahomedan in its character. The extremest\r\ncase that I met with was in a lady, who declared, with complacency, that\r\nshe could not walk a mile. She owned her belief that the inactivity of\r\nthe American women shortened their lives by some years; but thought this\r\ndid not matter, as they were not aware of it at the time.\r\n\r\nI should like to see a well-principled reform in diet tried, with a view\r\nto the improvement of the general health. I should like to see hot bread\r\nand cakes banished; a diminution in the quantity of pickles and\r\npreserves, and also in the quantity of meat eaten. I should like to see\r\nthe effect of making the diet of children more simple. Almost any change\r\nwould be worth trying for so great an object. What is to become of the\r\nnext, and again of the succeeding generation, if the average of health\r\ncannot be raised, it is fearful to think of. The only prevalence of\r\nvigorous health that I witnessed in the country, was in the elevated\r\nparts of the Alleghany range; in the State of Michigan; and perhaps I\r\nmight add, among the ladies of Charleston, who pass three quarters of\r\nthe year in the open air of their piazzas.[26]\r\n\r\nAll these means of improving health, though probably necessary, will\r\nnot avail without some others. There must be less anxiety of mind among\r\nmen, and less vacuity among women. With a brain fully but equably\r\nexercised, and composed nerves, the above-mentioned methods would\r\nprobably enable the Americans to defy the changes of their climate: but\r\nnot without this justice to the brain and nerves. It is rather\r\nremarkable that this anxiety prevails most in the parts of the country\r\nwhich make the most conspicuous profession of religion. Religious faith\r\nand hope should naturally promote health and equanimity by teaching the\r\nspirit to repose on immovable principles, and unintermitting laws: by\r\ndisburdening the mind of worldly cares, and giving rest to the weary and\r\nheavy-laden. If it does not thus calm and lighten the mind, it fails of\r\nits effect. If it disturbs the mental and bodily frame, its operation is\r\nperverted. It would be well if this were looked to. The more moderate\r\nreligionists point to the graves of the young who have fallen victims to\r\nRevivals. Let them look at home to see if no spiritual competition, no\r\nasceticism interferes with the equable workings of the frame, by which\r\nits powers are kept in vigorous and joyous action, without excess.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt of this wear and tear from anxiety being the chief\r\ncause of the excessive use of tobacco in the United States. Its charm to\r\nmen, who have not the elasticity of health and good animal spirits to\r\noppose to toil and trouble, may be imagined. It is to be hoped that the\r\nenjoyment of the natural and perfect stimulant will soon supersede the\r\nuse of the artificial and pernicious one.\r\n\r\nThe vacuity of mind of many women is, I conclude, the cause of a vice\r\nwhich it is painful to allude to; but which cannot honestly be passed\r\nover, in the consideration of the morals and the health of American\r\nwomen. It is no secret on the spot, that the habit of intemperance is\r\nnot infrequent among women of station and education in the most\r\nenlightened parts of the country. I witnessed some instances, and heard\r\nof more. It does not seem to me to be regarded with all the dismay which\r\nsuch a symptom ought to excite. To the stranger, a novelty so horrible,\r\na spectacle so fearful, suggests wide and deep subjects of\r\ninvestigation. If women, in a region professing religion more\r\nstrenuously than any other, living in the deepest external peace,\r\nsurrounded by prosperity, and outwardly honoured more conspicuously than\r\nin any other country, can ever so far cast off self-restraint, shame,\r\ndomestic affection, and the deep prejudices of education, as to plunge\r\ninto the living hell of intemperance, there must be something fearfully\r\nwrong in their position. An intemperate man has strong temptation to\r\nplead: he began with conviviality, and only arrives at solitary\r\nintemperance as the ultimate degradation. A woman indulges in the vice\r\nin solitude and secrecy, as long as secrecy is possible. She knows that\r\nthere is no excuse, no solace, no hope. There is nothing before her but\r\ndespair. It is impossible to suppose than that there has otherwise been\r\ndespair throughout: the despair which waits upon vacuity. I believe that\r\nthe practice has, in some few cases, arisen from physicians prescribing\r\ncordials to growing girls at school, and from the difficulty found in\r\ndesisting from the use of agreeable stimulants. In other cases, the vice\r\nis hereditary. In others, no explanation remains, but that which appears\r\nto me quite sufficient,--vacuity of mind. Lest my mention of this very\r\nremarkable fact should lead to the supposition of the practice being\r\nmore common than it is, I think it right to state, that I happened to\r\nknow of seven or eight cases in the higher classes of society of one\r\ncity. The number of cases is a fact of comparatively small importance.\r\nThat one exists, is a grief which the whole of society should take to\r\nheart, and ponder with the entire strength of its understanding.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] The wages of domestic service vary, of course, according to\r\ncircumstances. In the eastern cities, a good footman is paid about\r\ntwenty-five dollars per month: a cook, two dollars a-week; and a\r\nhousemaid a dollar and a-half.\r\n\r\n[26] I was informed by an eminent physician, that within his\r\nrecollection, _goîtres_ were very common at Pittsburg. The patients\r\nrecovered, if early sent round to the open country on the other side of\r\nthe hill. Since the woods have been felled, and the city thereby well\r\nventilated, the disease has wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\n\r\n     \"An evidence and reprehension both\r\n     Of the mere schoolboy's lean and tardy growth.\"\r\n\r\n     _Cowper._\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing less than an entire work would be required for the discussion of\r\nthe subject of education in any country. I can only indicate here two or\r\nthree peculiarities which strike the stranger in the discipline of\r\nAmerican children; of those whose lot is cast in the northern States;\r\nfor it needs no further showing, that those who are reared among slaves\r\nhave not the ordinary chances of wisdom and peace.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, particularly those of New England, look with a just\r\ncomplacency on the apparatus of education furnished to their entire\r\npopulation.[27] There are schools provided for the training of every\r\nindividual, from the earliest age; colleges to receive the élite of the\r\nschools; and lyceums, and other such institutions, for the subsequent\r\ninstruction of working men. The provision of schools is so adequate,\r\nthat any citizen who sees a child at play during school-hours, may ask\r\n\"why are you not at school?\" and, unless a good reason be given, may\r\ntake him to the school-house of the district. Some, who do not penetrate\r\nto the principle of this, exclaim upon the tyranny practised upon the\r\nparents. The principle is, that, in a democracy, where life and society\r\nare equally open to all, and where all have agreed to require of each\r\nother a certain amount of intellectual and moral competency, the means\r\nbeing provided, it becomes the duty of all to see that the means are\r\nused. Their use is an indispensable condition of the privileges of\r\ncitizenship. No control is exercised as to how and where the child shall\r\nbe educated. It rests with the parent to send him to a public or private\r\nschool, or have him taught at home: but in case of his being found in a\r\nneglected state as to education, it is in the power of any citizen to\r\nbring him to the advantage provided for him by society.\r\n\r\nThe instruction furnished is not good enough for the youth of such a\r\ncountry, with such a responsibility and such a destiny awaiting them as\r\nthe working out the first democratic organisation that the world has\r\nwitnessed in practice. The information provided is both meagre and\r\nsuperficial. There is not even any systematic instruction given on\r\npolitical morals: an enormous deficiency in a republic. But it must be\r\nremembered how young the society is; how far it has already gone beyond\r\nmost other countries; and how great is the certainty that the majority,\r\nalways ultimately in the right, will gradually exalt the character of\r\nthe instruction which it has been already wise enough to provide. It\r\nmust be remembered too, how much farther the same kind and degree of\r\ninstruction goes in a democracy than elsewhere. The alphabet itself is\r\nof little or no value to a slave, while it is an inestimable treasure\r\nto a conscious young republican. One needs but go from a charity-school\r\nin an English county to a free-school in Massachusetts, to see how\r\ndifferent the bare acquisition of reading and writing is to children\r\nwho, if they look forward at all, do it languidly, and into a life of\r\nmechanical labour merely, and to young citizens who are aware that they\r\nhave their share of the work of self-government to achieve. Elderly\r\ngentlemen in the country may smile, and foreigners of all ages may scoff\r\nat the self-confidence and complacency of young men who have just\r\nexercised the suffrage for the first time: but the being secure of the\r\ndignity, the certainty of being fully and efficaciously represented, the\r\nprobability of sooner or later filling some responsible political\r\noffice, are a stimulus which goes far to supply the deficiencies of the\r\ninstruction imparted. It is much to be wished that this stimulus were as\r\nstrong and as virtuous in one or two colleges whose inmates are on the\r\nvery verge of the exercise of their political rights, as in some of even\r\nthe primary schools. The aristocratic atmosphere of Harvard University,\r\nfor instance, would be much purified by a few breezes of such democratic\r\ninspiration as issue from the school-houses of some of the country\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nSome persons plead that there is less occasion for school instruction in\r\nthe principles of politics, than for an improved teaching of some other\r\nthings; because children are instructed in politics every day of their\r\nlives by what they hear at home, and wherever they go. But they hear all\r\ntoo little of principles. What they hear is argumentation about\r\nparticular men, and immediate measures. The more sure they are of\r\nlearning details elsewhere, the more necessary it is that they should\r\nhere be exercised in those principles by which the details are to be\r\njudged and made available as knowledge. They come to school with their\r\nheads crammed with prejudices, and their memories with words, which it\r\nshould be part of the work of school to reduce to truth and clearness,\r\nby substituting principles for the one, and annexing ideas to the other.\r\n\r\nA Sunday-school teacher asked a child, \"Who killed Abel?\" \"General\r\nJackson.\"--Another inquired of a scholar, \"In what state were mankind\r\nleft after the fall?\"--\"In the State of Vermont.\"\r\n\r\nThe early republican consciousness of which I have spoken, and the fact\r\nof the more important place which the children occupy in a society whose\r\nnumbers are small in proportion to its resources, are the two\r\ncircumstances which occasion that freedom of manners in children of\r\nwhich so much complaint has been made by observers, and on which so much\r\nremonstrance has been wasted;--I say \"wasted,\" because remonstrance is\r\nof no avail against a necessary fact. Till the United States cease to be\r\nrepublican, and their vast area is fully peopled, the children there\r\nwill continue as free and easy and as important as they are. For my own\r\npart, I delight in the American children; in those who are not overlaid\r\nwith religious instruction. There are instances, as there are\r\neverywhere, of spoiled, pert, and selfish children. Parents' hearts are\r\npierced there, as elsewhere. But the independence and fearlessness of\r\nchildren were a perpetual charm in my eyes. To go no deeper, it is a\r\nconstant amusement to see how the speculations of young minds issue,\r\nwhen they take their own way of thinking, and naturally say all they\r\nthink. Some admirable specimens of active little minds were laid open to\r\nme at a juvenile ball at Baltimore. I could not have got at so much in a\r\nyear in England. If I had at home gone in among eighty or a hundred\r\nlittle people, between the ages of eight and sixteen, I should have\r\nextracted little more than \"Yes, ma'am,\" and \"No, ma'am.\" At Baltimore,\r\na dozen boys and girls at a time crowded round me, questioning,\r\ndiscussing, speculating, revealing in a way which enchanted me. In\r\nprivate houses, the comments slipped in at table by the children were\r\noften the most memorable, and generally the most amusing part of the\r\nconversation. Their aspirations all come out. Some of these are very\r\nstriking as indicating the relative value of things in the children's\r\nminds. One affectionate little sister, of less than four years old,\r\nstimulated her brother William, (five,) by telling him that if he would\r\nbe very very good, he might in time be called William Webster; and then\r\nhe might get on to be as good as Jesus Christ. Three children were\r\ntalking over the birth-day of the second, (ten) and how they should like\r\nto keep it. They settled that they should like of all things to have\r\nMiss Sedgwick, and Mr. Bryant, and myself, to spend the day with them.\r\nThey did not venture to invite us, and had no intention of our knowing\r\ntheir wish.\r\n\r\nIn conversing with a truly wise parent, one day, I remarked on the\r\nchange of relation which takes place when the superior children of\r\nordinary parents become guides and protectors to those who have kept\r\ntheir childhood restrained under a rigid rule. We talked over the\r\ndifficulties of the transition here, (by far the hardest part of filial\r\nduty,) and speculated on what the case would be after death, supposing\r\nthe parties to recognise each other in a new life of progression. My\r\nfriend observed that the only thing to be done is to avoid to the utmost\r\nthe exercise of authority, and to make children friends from the very\r\nbeginning. He and many others have done this with gladdening success.\r\nThey do not lay aside their democratic principles in this relation, more\r\nthan in others, because they happen to have almost unlimited power in\r\ntheir own hands. They watch and guard: they remove stumbling-blocks:\r\nthey manifest approbation and disapprobation: they express wishes, but,\r\nat the same time, study the wishes of their little people: they leave as\r\nmuch as possible to natural retribution: they impose no opinions, and\r\nquarrel with none: in short, they exercise the tenderest friendship\r\nwithout presuming upon it. What is the consequence? I had the pleasure\r\nof hearing this friend say, \"There is nothing in the world so easy as\r\nmanaging children. You may make them anything you please.\" In my own\r\nmind I added, \"with such hearts and minds to bring to the work as the\r\nparents of your children have.\"--One reason of the pleasure with which I\r\nregarded the freedom of American children was that I took it as a sign\r\nthat the most tremendous suffering perhaps of human life is probably\r\nlessened, if not obviated, there:--the misery of concealed doubts and\r\nfears, and heavy solitary troubles,--the misery which makes the early\r\nyears of a shy child a fearful purgatory. Yet purgatory is not the word:\r\nfor this misery purges no sins, while it originates many. I have a\r\nstrong suspicion that the faults of temper so prevalent where parental\r\nauthority is strong, and where children are made as insignificant as\r\nthey can be made, and the excellence of temper in America, are\r\nattributable to the different management of childhood in the one article\r\nof freedom. There is no doubt that many children are irrecoverably\r\ndepressed and unnerved for want of being convinced that anybody cares\r\nfor them. They nourish doubts, they harbour fears and suspicions, and\r\ncarry within them prejudices and errors, for want of its occurring to\r\nthem to ask questions; and though they may outgrow these defects and\r\nerrors, they never recover from them. Unexplained and inexplicable\r\nobstacles are thrown in the way of their filial duty,--obstacles which\r\nnot even the strongest conscientiousness can overcome with grace: the\r\nvigour of the spirit is prostrated, or perverted into wilfulness: the\r\ncalmness of self-respect is forfeited, and so is the repose of a loving\r\nfaith in others. In short, the temper is ruined, and the life is\r\nspoiled; and all from the parents not having made friends of their\r\nchildren from the beginning.--No one will suppose that I mean to\r\nrepresent this mistake as general anywhere. But I am confident it is\r\nvery common at home: and that it cannot, in the nature of things, ever\r\nbecome common in America. I saw one or two melancholy instances of it:\r\nand a few rare cases where parents attempted unjustifiably to rule the\r\nproceedings of their grown up sons and daughters; not by express\r\ncommand, but by pleas which, from a parent, are more irresistible than\r\neven commands. But these were remarkable, and remarked upon, as\r\nexceptions. I saw two extreme contrasting cases, in near neighbourhood,\r\nof girls brought up, the one in the spirit of love, the other in that of\r\nfear. Those two girls are the best teachers of moral philosophy that\r\never fell in my way. In point of birth, organisation, means of\r\neducation, they were about equal. Both were made to be beautiful and\r\nintelligent. The one is pallid, indolent, (with the reputation of\r\nlearning,) tasteless, timid, and triste, manifesting nothing but\r\noccasionally an intense selfishness, and a prudery beyond belief. The\r\neducation of this girl has been the study of her anxious parents from\r\nthe day of her birth: but they have omitted to let her know and feel\r\nthat anybody loved her. The other, the darling of a large family,\r\nmeeting love from all eyes, and hearing tenderness in every voice, is\r\nbeautiful as a Hebe, and so free and joyous that her presence is like\r\nsunshine in a rainy day. She knows that she is beautiful and\r\naccomplished; but she is, as far as eye can see, absolutely devoid of\r\nvanity. She has been apprised, over and over again, that people think\r\nher a genius: she silently contradicts this, and settles with herself\r\nthat she can acquire anything, but originate nothing. She studies with\r\nher whole being, as if she were coming out next year in a learned\r\nprofession. She dances at balls as if nothing lay beyond the ball-room.\r\nShe flits hither and thither, in rain or sunshine, walking, riding, or\r\ndriving, on little errands of kindness; and bears the smallest interests\r\nof her friends in mind in the heights of her mirth and the depths of her\r\nstudies. At dull evening parties, she can sit under the lamp, (little\r\nknowing how beautiful she looks) quietly amusing herself with prints,\r\nand not wanting notice: and she can speak out what she thinks and feels\r\nto a circle of admirers, as simply and earnestly as she would to her own\r\nmother. I have seen people shake their heads, and fear lest she should\r\nbe spoiled; but my own conviction is that this young creature is\r\nunspoilable. She has had all the praise and admiration she can have: no\r\nwatchfulness of parents can keep them from her. She does not want praise\r\nand admiration. She has other interests and other desires: and my belief\r\nis, that if she were left alone to-morrow, the last of her family, she\r\nwould be as safe, busy, and, in due time, happy, as she is now under\r\ntheir tender guardianship. She is the most complete example I ever\r\nwitnessed of a being growing up in the light and warmth and perfect\r\nfreedom of love; and she has left me very little toleration for\r\nauthority, in education more than in anything else.\r\n\r\nA question was asked me, oftener than once, which indicates the\r\ndifference between family manners in England and America. I was asked\r\nwhether it was possible that the Bennet family would act as they are\r\nrepresented in \"Pride and Prejudice:\" whether a foolish mother, with\r\ngrown up daughters, would be allowed to spoil the two youngest, instead\r\nof the sensible daughters taking the case into their own hands. It is\r\ncertainly true that in America the superior minds of the family would\r\ntake the lead; while in England, however the domestic affairs might\r\ngradually arrange themselves, no person would be found breathing the\r\nsuggestion of superseding the mother's authority. The most remarkable\r\ndifference is, that in England the parents value the authority as a\r\nright, however lenient they may be in the use of it. In America, the\r\nparent disapproves of it, as a matter of reason: and, if he acts\r\nrationally, had rather not possess it. Little revelations of the state\r\nof the case were perpetually occurring, which excited my wonder at\r\nfirst, and my interest throughout. It appeared through the smallest\r\ncircumstances; as, for instance, when a lady was describing to me the\r\nwedding-day of her eldest daughter. She mentioned that two or three of\r\nthe children were not in the drawing-room at the time of the ceremony.\r\nWhy? They were so angry at their brother-in-law for taking away their\r\nsister, that they kept out of the way till he had driven from the door\r\nwith his bride. What children in England would have dreamed of absenting\r\nthemselves in such a way?\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe what the ability for self-preservation is among\r\nchildren in a country where nursemaids are scarce. It frightened me at\r\nfirst to see mere babies playing on broken wooden bridges, where the\r\nrushing water below might be seen through large holes; and little boys\r\nclimbing trees which slanted over a rocky precipice; or getting into a\r\ncanoe tossing on a rough river. But I find that accidents to children\r\nare rarely or never heard of. The obvious results of such training are a\r\ndexterity, fearlessness, and presence of mind, and aptitude for bodily\r\nexercises, which are of eminent use in mature life.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to perceive in some of the cities, especially in Boston, an\r\nunconsciousness on the part of many parents of the superior value of the\r\ndiscipline of circumstance to that of express teaching, in the work of\r\neducation. Perhaps no one would be found to deny in words that the best\r\ntraining is that which exercises the whole being of a child: yet there\r\nis a method of education somewhat in fashion in Boston just now, which\r\nbids fair to kill off its victims in early life; and irreparably\r\ninjure,--morally as well as physically,--those whom it may spare. The\r\ngood people of Boston are more fond of excitement than of consistency:\r\nor, rather, that part of society is so which professes to constitute the\r\ncity. When Spurzheim was there, the brain was everything; and his wise\r\nand benevolent remonstrances about the neglect or abuse of the bodily\r\npowers were received with great candour, and with much apparent\r\nconviction. Short as the interval has been, a considerable number of his\r\ndisciples have gone directly over to the opposite philosophy; and in\r\ntheir spiritualism out-herod Herod. They frame their theory and practice\r\non the principle that human beings are created perfect spirits in an\r\ninfant body. Some go further back than this, and actually teach little\r\nchildren dogmatically that spirit makes body; and that their own bodies\r\nare the result of the efforts of their spirits to manifest themselves.\r\nSuch outrageous absurdities might be left to contempt, but for the\r\nconsequences in practice. There is a school in Boston, (a large one,\r\nwhen I left the city,) conducted on this principle. The master\r\npresupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth, in philosophy and\r\nmorals; and that his business is to bring it out into expression; to\r\nhelp the outward life to conform to the inner light; and, especially, to\r\nlearn of these enlightened babes, with all humility. Large exposures\r\nmight be made of the mischief this gentleman is doing to his pupils by\r\nrelaxing their bodies, pampering their imaginations, over-stimulating\r\nthe consciences of some, and hardening those of others; and by his\r\nextraordinary management, offering them every inducement to falsehood\r\nand hypocrisy. His system can be beneficial to none, and must be ruinous\r\nto many. If he should retain any pupils long enough to make a full trial\r\nof his methods with them, those who survive the neglect of bodily\r\nexercises and over-excitement of brain, will be found the first to throw\r\noff moral restraints, on perceiving at length that their moral guide has\r\nbeen employing their early years in the pursuit of shadows and the\r\ncontempt of realities. There is, however, little fear of such a full\r\ntrial being made. A few weeks are enough to convince sensible parents of\r\nthe destructiveness of such a system; and it will probably issue in\r\nbeing one of the fancies of the day at Boston; and little heard of\r\nanywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle is, however, working mischief in other\r\ndirections. It affects, very unfortunately, the welfare of the blind;\r\nand yet more of the deaf and dumb who are taken under the benevolent\r\nprotection of society. As long as there are many of the most\r\ndistinguished members of the community who hold that the interior being\r\nof these sufferers is in a perfect state, only the means of\r\nmanifestation being deficient; that their training is to proceed on the\r\nsupposition of their being possessed of a complete set of intellectual\r\nand moral intuitions; and that they therefore only need to be furnished\r\nwith types, being already full of the things typified; and even that\r\nthey have the advantage over others in the exclusion of false and vulgar\r\nassociations,--the pupils will have little chance of benefit beyond the\r\nprotection and comfort secured to them in their appropriate\r\ninstitutions. In the conversation of those who verbally pitied their\r\ncase, I could frequently trace an inward persuasion that the deaf and\r\ndumb were better off than those who could hear and speak: and there were\r\nfew who discovered, while admiring the supposed allegorical discourse or\r\ncompositions of the pupils, that the whole was little more than a set of\r\nimages, absolutely empty of the abstract truth which they were supposed\r\nto involve. I had witnessed this tremendous error in the teaching of the\r\ndeaf and dumb elsewhere; but I little thought ever to meet with it\r\nbeyond the confines of the particular, and almost inscrutable case under\r\nnotice. In the school above mentioned, however, error nourishes, blessed\r\nas the pupils are with their five senses and the instrument of speech.\r\n\r\nPutting aside such cases of eccentricity, the children of America have\r\nthe advantage of the best possible early discipline; that of activity\r\nand self-dependence. The grand defect is a subsequent one. Education is\r\nnot made appropriate to the aims of its subjects. All, whatever may be\r\ntheir views in life, are educated nearly alike up to nineteen. This is\r\nan absurdity copied from the old world, but unworthy of the good sense\r\nof the new. It will be rectified when the lives of rich men become as\r\nsteadily aimed as those of citizens who have their way to make. Young\r\nmen of fortune, who may have a taste for science or literature, do not\r\nyield themselves up to these pursuits, because \"there is yet no\r\nscientific or literary class for them to fall into.\" Where is the\r\nnecessity to them of such a class to fall into? And, supposing the\r\nnecessity, how is there ever to be such a class, unless somebody begins\r\nto supply the elements?--It will be done. No restraint of custom will\r\nlong be powerful enough to curb the force of intellectual tendency. The\r\npassion for truth, the craving for knowledge, are ever found, in the\r\nlong run, irrepressible by the incubus of conventionalism. A genius will\r\narise, now here, now there, to startle society out of its rules and\r\nprecedents: and when America has had, now a philosopher and now a poet,\r\nwho, like Schiller's \"true artist,\" shall \"look upwards to his dignity\r\nand his calling, and not downwards to his happiness and his wants,\"\r\nsociety will enlarge its discipline, and become a great preparatory\r\nschool for the fruition of whatever the hand of man findeth to do, or\r\nhis understanding to investigate, or his imagination to reveal.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[27] See Appendix D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSUFFERERS.\r\n\r\n     \"One of the universal sentiments which Christianity has deeply\r\n     imbedded in the human heart is that of the _natural equality of\r\n     men_.... It has produced the spectacle, which I believe to be\r\n     peculiar to christian times, of one class uplifting another, the\r\n     happy toiling for the miserable, the free vindicating the rights of\r\n     the oppressed. With all the noble examples of disinterested\r\n     friendship and patriotism, which ancient history affords, I can\r\n     remember no approach to that _wholesale compassion_, that general\r\n     action of one order of society on another, that system of\r\n     _benevolent agitation_ in behalf of powerless and forgotten\r\n     suffering, which characterises the history of modern times.\"\r\n\r\n     _Rationale of Religious Inquiry._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of travelling in America was first suggested to me by a\r\nphilanthropist's saying to me, \"Whatever else may be true about the\r\nAmericans, it is certain that they have got at principles of justice and\r\nmercy in the treatment of the least happy classes of society which we\r\nmay be glad to learn from them. I wish you would go and see what they\r\nare.\" I did so; and the results of my investigation have not been\r\nreserved for this short chapter, but are spread over the whole of my\r\nbook. The fundamental democratic principles on which American society is\r\norganised, are those \"principles of justice and mercy\" by which the\r\nguilty, the ignorant, the needy, and the infirm, are saved and blessed.\r\nThe charity of a democratic society is heart-reviving to witness; for\r\nthere is a security that no wholesale oppression is bearing down the\r\nmillion in one direction, while charity is lifting up the hundred in\r\nanother. Generally speaking, the misery that is seen is all that exists:\r\nthere is no paralysing sense of the hopelessness of setting up\r\nindividual benevolence against social injustice. If the community has\r\nnot yet arrived at the point at which all communities are destined to\r\narrive, of perceiving guilt to be infirmity, of obviating punishment,\r\nignorance, and want, still the Americans are more blessed than others,\r\nin the certainty that they have far less superinduced misery than\r\nsocieties abroad, and are using wiser methods than others for its\r\nalleviation. In a country where social equality is the great principle\r\nin which all acquiesce, and where, consequently, the golden rule is\r\nsuggested by every collision between man and man, neglect of misery is\r\nalmost as much out of the question as the oppression from which most\r\nmisery springs.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the guilty, America is beyond the rest of the world,\r\nexactly in proportion to the superiority of her political principles. I\r\nwas favoured with the confidence of a great number of the prisoners in\r\nthe Philadelphia penitentiary where absolute seclusion is the principle\r\nof punishment. Every one of these prisoners, (none of them being aware\r\nof the existence of any other,) told me that he was under obligations to\r\nthose who had the charge of him for treating him \"with respect.\" The\r\nexpression struck me much as being universally used by them. Some\r\nexplained the contrast between this method of punishment and\r\nimprisonment in the old prisons, copied from those of Europe; where\r\ncriminals are herded together, and treated like anything but men and\r\ncitizens. Others said that though they had done a wrong thing, and were\r\nrightly sequestered on that ground, they ought not to have any farther\r\npunishment inflicted upon them; and that it was the worst of punishments\r\nnot to be treated with the respect due to men. In a community where\r\ncriminals feel and speak thus, human rights cannot but be, at length, as\r\nmuch regarded in the infliction of punishment as in its other\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nMuch yet remains to be done, to this end. An enormous amount of wrong\r\nmust remain in a society where the elaboration of a vast apparatus for\r\nthe infliction of human misery, like that required by the system of\r\nsolitary imprisonment, is yet a work of mercy. Milder and juster methods\r\nof treating moral infirmity will succeed when men shall have learned to\r\nobviate the largest possible amount of it. In the meantime, I am\r\npersuaded that this is the best method of punishment which has yet been\r\ntried. Much as the prisoners suffer from the dreary solitude, cheered\r\nonly by their labour and the occasional visits of official\r\nsuperintendents, they testified, without exception and without concert,\r\nto their preference of this over all other methods of punishment. The\r\ngrounds of preference were, that they could preserve their self-respect,\r\nin the first place; and, in the next, their chance in society on their\r\nrelease. They leave the prison with the recompense of their extra labour\r\nin their pockets, and without the fear of being waylaid by vicious old\r\ncompanions, or hunted from employment to employment by those whose\r\ninterest it is to deprive them of a chance of establishing a character.\r\nThere is no evidence, at present, that solitary imprisonment, _with\r\nlabour_, is more injurious to health than any other condition which is\r\nattended with anxiety of mind. The Philadelphia prisoners certainly\r\nappeared to me to be more healthy-looking than those at Auburn, or at\r\nany other prison I visited.\r\n\r\nThere is at present a deficiency in the religious ministrations of the\r\nprison. This is a fact which, I believe, has only to be made known to\r\ncease to be true. Among the clergy of all denominations in Philadelphia,\r\nthere must be many who would contrive to afford their services in turn,\r\nif they were fully aware how much they are needed. I know of no\r\ndirection that can be taken by charity with such certainty of success as\r\nvisiting the solitary prisoner. I think it far from desirable that\r\nprisoners should be visited for the express purpose of giving them\r\nreligious, and no other, instruction and sympathy. The great object is\r\nto occupy the prisoner's mind with things which interest him most; to\r\nkeep up his sympathies, and nourish his human affections; and especially\r\nto promote the activity and cheerfulness of his mind. His situation is\r\nsuch,--he is so driven back upon the realities of life in his own mind,\r\nthat the danger is of his accepting religion as a temporary solace, of\r\nhis separating it in idea from active life, and craving for the most\r\nexciting kind of it; so as that when he returns to the world, he will\r\ndiscard it as something suiting his prison-life, but no longer needed,\r\nno longer appropriate. If, keeping this in view, a very few good men and\r\nwomen of Philadelphia would go sometimes to spend an hour with a\r\nprisoner, honourably observing the rules, telling no news, but\r\ncheerfully conversing on the prisoner's affairs,--his work, his family,\r\nhis prospects on coming out, the books he reads, &c.--if they would\r\ncarry him good and entertaining books, and if religious ones, only those\r\nof a moderate and cheerful character, (such being indeed not easy to be\r\nfound,)--these friendly visitors could scarcely fail of restoring, more\r\nor less completely, the moral health of the objects of their\r\nbenevolence. None who have not tried can imagine the ease with which\r\nsufferers so placed are influenced; in the absence of all that is\r\npernicious, and in absolute dependence, as they are, on the sympathy of\r\nthose who will be kind to them. If watchful observance were united with\r\ncommon prudence and kindness, I believe that a prisoner of five years\r\nwould rarely re-enter society unqualified for the discharge of his\r\nduties there. It must be remembered that the criminals of the United\r\nStates are rarely the depraved, brutish creatures that fill the prisons\r\nof the old world. Even in the old world, I have no doubt that every\r\nprison visitor has been conscious, on first conversing privately with a\r\ncriminal, of a feeling of surprise at finding him so human: but in\r\nAmerica, convicts are even more like other men. The reason of my\r\nvisiting them, as I told them, was to satisfy myself about the causes of\r\ncrime in a country where there is almost an absence of that want which\r\noccasions the greater proportion of social offences in England. Sooner\r\nor later, all told me their stories in full: and I found that in every\r\ncase some domestic misery had been the poison of their lives. A harsh\r\nstep-mother, an unfaithful wife, a jilting mistress, an intemperate son\r\nor father,--these were the miseries at home which sent them out to\r\ndrink: drinking brought on murder, or caused vicious wants, which must\r\nbe supplied by theft. The stories, infinitely varied in their\r\ncircumstances, were all alike in their moral.\r\n\r\nI do not like the principle of the Auburn prison: and I am confident\r\nthat very little effectual reformation can take place under it. The\r\ndisadvantages of the prisoners being waylaid and dogged on their\r\ndischarge are very great; but there are some within the prison quite as\r\nserious. The spy system is abominable, in whatever light it is viewed.\r\nIt is the deepest of insults; and if there be a case rather than another\r\nin which insult is to be avoided, it is where a reformation is desired.\r\nThe great point to be gained with the criminal is to regenerate\r\nself-respect. A virtuous man may preserve his self-respect under the\r\neyes of a spy; (though even he is in some danger); but a morally infirm\r\nman can never thus acquire it. Arrangements should be made for his\r\nsecure custody and harmless outward conduct, and then he should be left\r\nto himself. And what is the purpose of the spying,--of the loop-holes to\r\npeep through, and the moccasins which are to make the tread of the spies\r\nas stealthy as that of a cat? To detect talking; talking subjecting a\r\nman to the lash. Talking is an innocent act; and, in the case of men\r\nsecluded from the world and their families, and all that has hitherto\r\ninterested them, an unavoidable act. They ought to talk; and they do, in\r\nspite of spies, governor, and the whip. They learn to murmur\r\nintelligibly behind their teeth, without moving the lips, and to take\r\nadvantage of the briefest instants when the superintendent turns his\r\nback. It is surprising to me that any effectual reformation can be\r\nlooked for from men who, convicted of grave crimes, have the prohibition\r\nto speak set up before their minds as the chief circumstance and\r\ninterest of their lives for five, seven, or ten years. Their interest in\r\nit makes it the chief circumstance. How the disordered being is to be\r\nrectified, how the prostrated conscience is to be reinstated, while an\r\ninnocent and necessary act is thus erected into an offence, I leave\r\nthose who are most versed in moral proportions to decide. I do not\r\nbelieve in the possibility of effectual reformation in any but a few\r\ncases, under such a discipline.\r\n\r\nThe will of the majority has not yet wrought out the right practice\r\nfrom good principles, in two cases which regard the treatment of the\r\nguilty: and great evil arises in the interval. It is extremely\r\ndifficult, in some parts of the States, and with regard to some\r\nparticular offences, to get the laws enforced against offenders. In\r\nthose parts of the States where personal conflicts are countenanced by\r\nopinion, offences against the person go too often unpunished; elsewhere,\r\nriot is passed over without notice; and in some few places, the most\r\nheinous crimes of all are nearly certain to be got over without the\r\nconviction of the offender. The impunity of riot arises from the\r\nreliance society has on the moral sense of the whole: a reliance very\r\nhonourable in itself, but found of late to be inadequate under the\r\npressure of such a crisis as that of the anti-slavery question. Nothing\r\ncan be more honourable to the people, than the fact that they have been\r\nsafe and virtuous under the superintendence of principle, while the laws\r\nhave slept so long, that it is now found difficult to put them in force:\r\nbut now that the time has come for a conflict of classes and opinions,\r\nthe time has also come for the law to be vigilant and inexorable. The\r\nfrequent impunity of the most serious crimes arises from the growing\r\nenmity of opinion to the punishment of death. There can be little doubt\r\nthat in a short time capital punishments will be abolished throughout\r\nthe northern States: and if this is to be done, the sooner it is done\r\nthe better: for the present impunity is a tremendous evil.\r\n\r\nIn passing the City Hall of one of the northern cities with a friend, I\r\nasked what was the meaning of a great crowd that was about the doors,\r\nand even clustered on the windows of the building. My friend told me,\r\nthat a young man was being examined on the charge of being the murderer\r\nin a most aggravated case, which had been related to me the day before.\r\nI observed, that no one seemed to have any doubt of his guilt. She\r\nreplied, that there never was a clearer case; but that he would be\r\nacquitted: the examination and trial were a mere form, of which every\r\none knew the conclusion beforehand. The people did not choose to see any\r\nmore hanging; and till the law was so altered as to allow an alternative\r\nof punishment, no conviction for a capital offence would be obtainable.\r\nI asked, on what pretence the young man would be got off, if the\r\nevidence against him was as clear as was represented. She said, some one\r\nwould be found to swear an alibi: the young man would be wholly\r\ndisgraced, and would probably set out westwards the morning after his\r\nacquittal. I watched the progress of the case. The trial was a long one.\r\nThere was no doubt of the suppression of large portions of the evidence\r\nagainst him. A tradesman swore an alibi: the young man was thereupon\r\nacquitted; and next morning he was on his way to the west.\r\n\r\nOn the principle that punishment should be reformatory, the practice of\r\npardoning criminals has gone to far too great an extent, from the belief\r\nof reformation in each particular case. The consequence is very\r\ninjurious. A sentence of life-imprisonment is generally understood to\r\nmean imprisonment for a shorter term than if ten or seven years had been\r\nnamed. Every one of the prisoners I conversed with was in anxious\r\nexpectation of a pardon. In the cases of those who were in for five\r\nyears, and who I knew would not be pardoned, I reasoned the matter; and\r\nfound that the fact of all their fellow-prisoners having the same\r\nexpectation with themselves, made a strong impression. They were, amidst\r\ntheir dreadful disappointment, easily convinced: but I could not but\r\nmourn that they did not learn the philosophy of the case in society,\r\nrather than in prison.\r\n\r\nWhenever the abolition of the punishment of death takes place, it will\r\nbe essential to the safety of virtue and society, that it should be\r\nunderstood that the practice of pardoning is, except on rare and\r\nspecified occasions, to cease; and that punishment is to be certain in\r\nproportion to its justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pauperism of the United States is, to the observation of a stranger,\r\nnothing at all. To residents, it is an occasion for the exercise of\r\ntheir ever-ready charity. It is confined to the ports, emigrants making\r\ntheir way back into the country, the families of intemperate or disabled\r\nmen, and unconnected women, who depend on their own exertions. The\r\namount altogether is far from commensurate with the charity of the\r\ncommunity; and it is to be hoped that the curse of a legal charity, at\r\nleast to the able-bodied, will be avoided in a country where it\r\ncertainly cannot become necessary within any assignable time. I was\r\ngrieved to see the magnificent pauper asylum near Philadelphia, made to\r\naccommodate luxuriously 1200 persons; and to have its arrangements\r\npointed out to me, as yielding far more comfort to the inmates than the\r\nlabourer can secure at home by any degree of industry and prudence.\r\nThere are so many persons in the city, however, who see the badness of\r\nthe principle, and regret the erection, that I trust a watch will be\r\nmaintained over the establishment, and its corridors kept as empty as\r\npossible. In Boston, the principles of true charity have been better\r\nacted upon. There, many of the clergymen,--among the rest, Father\r\nTaylor, the seaman's friend,--are in possession of wisdom, derived from\r\nthe mournful experience of England; and seem likely to save the city\r\nfrom the misery of a debasing pauperism among any class of its\r\ninhabitants. I know no large city where there is so much mutual\r\nhelpfulness, so little neglect and ignorance of the concerns of other\r\nclasses, as in Boston: and I cannot but anticipate that from thence the\r\nworld may derive the brightest lesson that has yet been offered it, in\r\nthe duties of the rich towards the poor. If the agents of the\r\nbenevolence of the wealthy will but be scrupulously careful to avoid all\r\nthat mental encroachment and moral interference, which have but too\r\ngenerally ruined the efficacy of charity, and go on to exhibit the\r\ndevotion of the philanthropist, without the inquisitiveness and\r\nauthoritativeness of the priest, they may deserve the thanks of the\r\nwhole of society, as well as the attachment of those whom they befriend.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, an excellent plan has been adopted for the prevention of\r\nfraud on the part of paupers, and the mutual enlightenment and guidance\r\nof the agents of charity. A weekly meeting is held of delegates, from\r\nall societies engaged in the relief of the poor. The delegates compare\r\nlists of the persons relieved, so as to ascertain that none are\r\nfraudulently receiving from more than one society: they discuss and\r\ninvestigate doubtful cases; extend indulgence to those of peculiar\r\nhardship; and, in short, secure all the advantages of co-operation.\r\nPerhaps there are no cities in England but London too large for a\r\nsomewhat similar organisation: and its adoption would be an act of great\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nIn the south, I was rather amused at a boast which was made to me of the\r\nsmall amount of pauperism. As the plague distances all lesser diseases,\r\nso does slavery obviate pauperism. In a society of two classes, where\r\nthe one class are all capitalists, and the other property, there can be\r\nno pauperism but through the vice or accidental disability of members\r\nof the first. But I was beset by many an anxious thought about the fate\r\nof disabled slaves. Masters are, of course, bound to take care of their\r\nslaves for life. There are doubtless many masters who guard the comfort\r\nof their helpless negroes all the more carefully from the sense of the\r\nentire dependence of the poor creatures upon their mercy: but, there are\r\nfew human beings fit to be trusted with absolute power: and while there\r\nare many who abuse the authority they have over slaves who are not\r\nhelpless, it is fearful to think what may be the fate of those who are\r\npurely burdensome. I observed, here and there, an idiot slave. Those\r\nwhom I saw were kindly treated, humoured, and indulged. These were the\r\nonly cases of natural infirmity that I witnessed among the negroes; and\r\nthe absence of others struck me. At Columbia, South Carolina, I was\r\ntaken by a benevolent physician to see the State Lunatic Asylum, which\r\nmight be considered his work; so diligent had he been in obtaining\r\nappropriations for the object from the legislature, and afterwards in\r\norganising its plans, with great wisdom and humanity. When we were\r\nlooking out from the top of this building, watching the patients in\r\ntheir airing grounds, I observed that no people of colour were visible\r\nin any part of the establishment. I inquired whether negroes were as\r\nsubject to insanity as whites. Probably; but no means were known to have\r\nbeen taken to ascertain the fact. From the violence of their passions,\r\nthere could be no doubt that insanity must exist among them. Were such\r\ninsane negroes ever seen?--No one present had ever seen any.--Where were\r\nthey then?--It was some time before I could get a clear answer to this:\r\nbut my friend the physician said, at length, that he had no doubt they\r\nwere kept in out-houses, chained to logs, to prevent their doing harm.\r\nNo member of society is charged with the duty of investigating cases of\r\ndisease and suffering among slaves who cannot make their own state\r\nknown. They are wholly at the mercy of their owners. The physician told\r\nme that it was his intention, now he had accomplished his object of\r\nestablishing a lunatic asylum for the whites, to persevere no less\r\nstrenuously till he obtained one for the blacks. He will probably not\r\nfind this a very difficult object to effect; for the interest of\r\nmasters, as well as their humanity, is concerned in having an asylum\r\nprovided by the State for their useless or mischievous negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Lunatic Asylums of the United States are an honour to the country,\r\nto judge by those which I saw. The insane in Pennsylvania hospital,\r\nPhiladelphia, should be removed to some more light and cheerful abode,\r\nand be much more fully supplied with employment, and with stimulus to\r\nengage in it. I was less pleased with their condition than with that of\r\nany other insane patients whom I saw. The institution at Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, is admirably managed under Dr. Woodward. So was that at\r\nCharlestown, near Boston, by Dr. Lee; a young physician who has since\r\ndied, mourned by his grateful patients, and by all who had their welfare\r\nat heart. The establishment at Bloomingdale, near New York, is of\r\nsimilar excellence. The only great deficiency that I am aware of is one\r\nwhich belongs to most lunatic asylums, and which it does not rest with\r\nthe superintendent to supply;--a want of sufficient employment. Every\r\nexertion is made to provide a variety of amusements, and to encourage\r\nall little undertakings that may be suggested: but regular, important\r\nbusiness is what is wanted. It is to be hoped that in the establishment\r\nof all such institutions, the provision of an ample quantity of land\r\nwill be one of the prime considerations. Watchful and ingenious kindness\r\nmay do much to alleviate the miseries of the insane; but if cure is\r\nsought, I believe it is agreed by those who know best, that regular\r\nemployment, with a reasonable object, is indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe Asylum for the Blind at Philadelphia was a young institution at the\r\ntime I saw it; but it pleased me more than any I ever visited: more than\r\nthe larger one at Boston; whose institution and conduct are, however,\r\nhonourable to all concerned in it. The reason of my preference of the\r\nPhiladelphia one is that the pupils there were more active and cheerful\r\nthan those of Boston. The spirits of the inmates are the one infallible\r\ntest of the management of an institution for the blind. The fault of\r\nsuch in general is that mirth is not sufficiently cultivated, and\r\nreligion too exclusively so. It should ever be remembered that religion\r\ncomes out of the mind, and not in at the eye or ear; and that the truest\r\nway of cultivating religion is to exercise the faculties, and enlarge\r\nthe stock of ideas to the utmost. The method of printing for the blind,\r\nintroduced with such admirable ingenuity and success into the American\r\ninstitutions, I should like to see employed to bring within the reach of\r\nthe blind the most amusing works that can be found. I should like to see\r\nit made an object with benevolent persons to go and give the pupils a\r\nhearty laugh occasionally, by reading droll books, and telling amusing\r\nstories. The one thing which the born blind want most is to have their\r\ncheerlessness removed, to be drawn out of their abstractions, and\r\nexercised in play on the greatest possible variety of familiar objects\r\nand events. They should hear no condolence: their friends should keep\r\ntheir sympathetic sorrow to themselves; and explain, cheerfully and\r\nfully, the allusions to visual objects which must occur in all reading\r\nand conversation. It grieves me to hear the hymns and other compositions\r\nput into the mouths of blind pupils, all full of lamentation and\r\nresignation about not seeing the stars and the face of nature. Such\r\nsorrow is for those who see to feel on their behalf; or for those who\r\nhave lost sight: not for those who never saw. Put into their mouths, it\r\nbecomes cant. When a roving sea-captain tells his children of the\r\nglories of oriental scenery which they are destined never to behold,\r\ndoes he teach them to sigh, and struggle to submit patiently to their\r\ndestiny of staying at home? Does he not rather make them take pleasure\r\nin mirthfully and eagerly learning what he can teach? The face of nature\r\nis a foreign land to the born blind. Let them be taught all that can\r\npossibly be conveyed to them, and in the most spirited manner that they\r\ncan bear. There is a nearer approach to the realisation of this\r\nprinciple of teaching the blind in the Philadelphia house than I ever\r\nsaw elsewhere. It would be enough to cheer a misanthrope to see a little\r\nGerman boy there, picked up out of the streets, dull, neglected, and\r\ndepressed; but within a few months, standing in the centre of the group\r\nof musicians, fiddling and stamping time with all his might, and quite\r\nready to obey every instigation to laugh. Mr. Friedlander, the tutor, is\r\nmuch to be congratulated on what he has already done.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth suggesting here that while some of the thinkers of\r\nAmerica, like many of the same classes in England, are mourning over the\r\nlow state of the Philosophy of Mind in their country, society is\r\nneglecting a most important means of obtaining the knowledge requisite\r\nfor the acquisition of such philosophy. Scholars are embracing\r\nalternately the systems of Kant, of Fichte, of Spurzheim, of the Scotch\r\nschool; or abusing or eulogising Locke asking who Hartley was, or\r\nweaving a rainbow arch of transcendentalism, which is to comprehend the\r\nwhole that lies within human vision, but sadly liable to be puffed away\r\nin dark vapour with the first breeze of reality; scholars are thus\r\nlabouring at a system of mental philosophy on any but the experimental\r\nmethod, while the materials for experiment lie all around and within\r\nthem. If they object, as is common, the difficulty of experimenting on\r\ntheir conscious selves, there is the mental pathology of their blind\r\nschools, and the asylums for the deaf and dumb. I am aware that they put\r\naway the phenomena of insanity as irrelevant; but the same objections do\r\nnot pertain to the other two classes. Let the closet speculations be\r\npursued with all vigour: but if there were joined with these a close and\r\nunwearied study of the phenomena of the minds of persons deficient in a\r\nsense, and especially of those precluded from the full use of language,\r\nthe world might fairly look for an advance in the science of Mind equal\r\nto that which medical science owes to pathology. It will not probably\r\nlodge us in any final and total result, any more than medicine and\r\nanatomy promise to ascertain the vital principle: but it will doubtless\r\nyield us some points of certainty, in aid of the fluctuating\r\nspeculations amidst which we are now tossed, while few can be found to\r\nagree even upon matters of so-called universal consciousness. I should\r\nlike to see a few philosophers interested in ascertaining and recording\r\nthe manifestations of some progressive minds, peculiar from infirmity,\r\nfor a series of years. If any such in America, worthy to undertake the\r\ntask, from having strength enough to put away theory and prejudice, and\r\nrecord only what is really manifested to them, should be disposed to\r\ntake my hint, I hope they will not wait for a philosophical \"class to\r\nfall into.\"\r\n\r\nI was told at Washington, with a smile half satirical and half\r\ncomplacent, that \"the people of New England do good by mania.\" I watched\r\naccordingly for symptoms of this second or third-rate method of putting\r\nbenevolence into practice. The result was, that I was convinced that the\r\npeople of New England, and of the whole country, do good in all manner\r\nof ways; some better and some worse, according to their light. I met\r\nwith pious ladies who make clothes for the poor, but who took work (her\r\nmeans of bread) out of the hands of a sempstress, (who had three\r\nchildren,) because her husband was in prison. They told me it would be\r\nencouraging vice to have anything to do with the families of persons who\r\nhad committed offences: and when I asked how reformed offenders were to\r\nput their reformation in practice, I was told that if I would employ\r\nanybody who had been in prison, I deserved the censure of society. The\r\nmatter ended in the sempstress (a good young woman) having to go home to\r\nher father's house. I met with others, both men and women, who make it\r\nthe business of their lives, or of their leisure from yet more pressing\r\nduties, to seek out the sinners of society, and give them, not threats,\r\nnor scorn, nor lectures, but sympathy and help. So does light vary in\r\nthis glimmering age; so eloquently does the conduct of Jesus speak to\r\nsome, while to others it seems to preach in an unknown tongue. With\r\nregard to some methods of charity, nothing could exceed the ingenuity,\r\nshrewdness, forethought, and determination with which they were managed:\r\nin others, I was reminded of what I had been told about mania.\r\n\r\nIn regarding the Temperance movement, the word perpetually occurred to\r\nme. How the vice of intemperance ever reached the pass it did in a\r\ncountry where there is no excuse of want on the one hand, or of habits\r\nof conviviality on the other, was sometimes attempted to be explained\r\nto me; but never to my satisfaction. Much may be said upon it, which\r\ncannot find a place here. Certain it is that the vice threatened to\r\npoison society. It was as remarkable as licentiousness of other kinds\r\never was in Paris, or at Vienna. Men who doubted the goodness of the\r\nprinciple of Association in opposition to moral evil, were yet carried\r\naway to countenance it by seeing nothing else that was to be done. Some\r\nfew of these foresaw that, as every man must be virtuous in himself and\r\nby himself; as the principle of temperance in a man is incommunicable;\r\nas no two men's temptations are alike; and as, especially in this case,\r\nthe temptations of the movers were immeasurably weaker than those of the\r\nmass to be wrought upon, there could be no radical truth, no pervading\r\nsincerity to rely upon. They foresaw what had happened; that there would\r\nbe a vast quantity of perjury, of false and hasty promising, of lapse,\r\nand of secret, solitary drinking; that if some waverers were saved,\r\nothers would be plunged into hypocrisy in addition to their\r\nintemperance; that schisms must arise out of the ignorance of bigots,\r\nwhich would cause as much scandal to good morals as intemperance itself;\r\nand that, worst of all, this method was the introduction of new and\r\nfatal perils to freedom of conscience. A few foresaw all this; but a\r\nvery few had strength to resist the movement. A sort of reproach was\r\ncast upon those who refused to join, like that which is now visited upon\r\nsuch as adhere to the principle on which they first joined;--a kind of\r\ninsinuation that their temperance is not thorough.--What have the\r\nconsequences already been?\r\n\r\nThe amount of visible intemperance is actually lessened prodigiously;\r\nperhaps to the full extent anticipated by the originators of the\r\nmovement. Spirit-shops have been shut up by hundreds; some few\r\ndrunkards have been reformed; and very large numbers of young men,\r\nentering life, are now sober citizens, who seemed in danger of becoming\r\na curse to society. The question is whether the causes of the preceding\r\nintemperance have been discovered and obviated. If not, there is every\r\nreason to expect that the control of opinion over them will be but\r\ntemporary; and that the late sweeping and garnishing will give place to\r\na state of things at least as bad as before.\r\n\r\nAt present, the effect of example is perishing, day by day. The example\r\nof those who have not pledged themselves is the only one morally\r\nregarded; all other persons being known to be bound. Virtue under a vow\r\nhas no spiritual force. The more reasonable of those who are pledged\r\nhave confined their pledge to the distinct case of not touching\r\ndistilled liquors. They have the utmost difficulty in maintaining their\r\nground, as examples, (their sole object,) under the assaults of bigots\r\nwho complain that they are not \"getting on;\" and who, on their part,\r\nhave got on so far as to refuse the communion to persons who will not\r\nabjure as they have done; to banish the sacramental wine; and to forbid\r\nmalt liquors, and even coffee, in taverns and private houses. The\r\nsuperstition,--the attachment to the form without the spirit,--is\r\nfearfully revealed upon occasion. A man was brought dead drunk into a\r\nwatch-house; and before the magistrate next morning, persisted that he\r\ncould not have been drunk, because he was a member of a Temperance\r\nSociety. The subservience of conscience to control is as necessary and\r\nremarkable. For instance, a gentleman, whose wife, in a state of\r\nimminent danger, was ordered brandy, ran and knocked up his minister to\r\nget leave before he would procure any for her. It is true that these\r\nare extreme cases: but the effect of such institutions upon weak minds\r\nmust be studied, as it is for weak minds that they are created.\r\n\r\nMy own convictions are that Associations, excellent as they are for\r\nmechanical objects, are not fit instruments for the achievement of moral\r\naims: that there is yet no proof that the principle of self-restraint\r\nhas been exalted and strengthened in the United States by the Temperance\r\nmovement, while the already too great regard to opinion, and\r\nsubservience to spiritual encroachment have been much increased: that,\r\ntherefore, great as are the visible benefits of the institution, it may\r\nat length appear that they have been dearly purchased. I have reason to\r\nthink that numbers of persons in the United States, especially\r\nenlightened physicians, (who have the best means of knowledge,) are of\r\nthe same opinion. This is confirmed by the fact that there is a\r\nspreading dislike of Associations for moral, while there is a growing\r\nattachment to them for mechanical, objects. The majority will show to\r\nthose who may be living at the time what is the right.\r\n\r\nThough scarcely necessary, it may be well to indicate the distinction\r\nbetween Temperance and Abolition societies with regard to this\r\nprinciple. The bond of Temperance societies is a pledge or vow\r\nrespecting the personal conduct of the pledger. The bond of the\r\nAbolitionists is agreement in a principle which is to be proposed and\r\nexhibited by mechanical means,--lecturing, printing, raising money for\r\nbenevolent purposes. Nobody is bound in thought, word, or action. There\r\nhave been a few Temperance societies which have avoided pledges, and\r\nconfined their exertions to spreading knowledge on the pathology of\r\nintemperance, and its effects on the morals of the individual and of\r\nsociety. Associations confined to these objects are probably not only\r\nharmless, but highly useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nUTTERANCE.\r\n\r\n     \"A country which has no national literature, or a literature too\r\n     insignificant to force its way abroad, must always be, to its\r\n     neighbours, at least in every important spiritual respect, an\r\n     unknown and misestimated country. Its towns may figure on our maps;\r\n     its revenues, population, manufactures, political connexions, may\r\n     be recorded in statistical books: but the character of the people\r\n     has no symbol and no voice; we cannot know them by speech and\r\n     discourse, but only by mere sight and outward observation of their\r\n     manners and procedure. Now, if both sight and speech, if both\r\n     travellers and native literature, are found but ineffectual in this\r\n     respect, how incalculably more so the former alone!\"\r\n\r\n     _Edinburgh Review._--Vol. xlvi. p. 309.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is but one method by which most nations can express the general\r\nmind: by their literature. Popular books are the ideas of the people put\r\ninto language by an individual. To a self-governing people there are two\r\nmethods open: legislation is the expression of the popular mind, as well\r\nas literature.\r\n\r\nIf the national mind of America be judged of by its legislation, it is\r\nof a very high order; so much less violence to the first principles of\r\nmorals is exhibited there than in any other social arrangements that\r\nthe world has yet seen. If the American nation be judged of by its\r\nliterature, it may be pronounced to have no mind at all.\r\n\r\nThe two appearances are, however, reconcilable. The mind of a nation\r\ngrows, like that of an individual; and its growth follows somewhat the\r\nsame course. There may be in each a mind, vigorous and full of promise,\r\nunerring in the recognition of true principles, but apt to err in the\r\napplication of them; ardent in admiration of all faithful and beautiful\r\nexpression of mind by others; but not yet knowing how to utter itself.\r\nThe youthful philosopher or poet is commonly a metaphysician before he\r\nindicates what he is ultimately to become. In the age of vivid\r\nconsciousness, before he is twenty, the invisible and intangible world\r\nof reality opens to him with a distinctness and lustre which make him in\r\nafter time almost envy himself his youthful years. In this bright\r\nspiritual world, much is as indisputably revealed to him as material\r\nobjects to the bodily eye: principles in full prominence; and a long\r\nperspective of certainties melting imperceptibly into probabilities; and\r\nlost at last in the haze of possibility, bright with the meridian sun of\r\nfaith. To him\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The primal duties shine aloft, like stars:\r\n     The charities that soothe and heal and bless\r\n     Lie scattered at the feet of man, like flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut of all this he can, for some time, express nothing. He burns with\r\nconvictions, but can testify them to others only by recognising the\r\nexpression which others have obtained the power of affording. If he\r\nmakes the attempt, he is either unintelligible or trite.\r\n\r\nThis appears to me to be the stage at which the mind of America has\r\narrived. That the legislation of the country is, on the whole, so\r\nnoble, is owing to the happy circumstance (a natural one in the order of\r\nProvidence, by which great agents rise up when a great work has to be\r\ndone) that accomplished individuals were standing ready to help the\r\npeople to an expression of its first convictions. The earliest\r\nconvictions of a nation so circumstanced are of their fundamental and\r\ncommon rights: and the expression must be legislation. This has been\r\ndone so well by the Americans that there is every reason to anticipate\r\nthat more will follow; since principles are so linked together that it\r\nis scarcely possible to grasp one without touching another. Accordingly,\r\nthough there is no contribution yet to the Philosophy of Mind from\r\nAmerica, many thinking men are feeling after its principles amidst the\r\naccumulations of the old world: though no light has been given to\r\nsociety from the American press on the principles of politics, Americans\r\nmay be heard quoting Burke from end to end of the country, infallibly\r\nseparating the democratic aspirations of his genius from the\r\naristocratic perversions of his temper and education: though America has\r\nyet witnessed no creation, either in literature or the arts, and cannot\r\neven distinguish a creation from a combination, imitation, or\r\ndelineation, yet the power of admiration which she shows in hailing that\r\nwhich is far inferior to what she needs,--the vigour with which, after\r\nincessant disappointment, she applies herself to the produce of her\r\npress, to find the imperishable in what is just as transient as all that\r\nhas gone before,--is a prophecy that a creator will arise. The faith\r\nthat America is to have an artist of some order is universal: and such a\r\nfaith is a sufficient guarantee of the event. Every ephemeron of a\r\ntale-writer, a dramatist, novelist, lyrist, and sonnetteer, has been\r\ntaken by one or another for the man. But he has not come out of his\r\nsilence yet; and it is likely that it may still be long before he does.\r\nEvery work of genius is, as has been said, a mystery till it appears.\r\nWhat its principles and elaboration may be, it is for one man only--its\r\nauthor--to conceive: but it is plain what it will not be. It will not\r\nbe, more or less, a copy of anything now existing. It will not be a mere\r\ndelineation of what passes before the bodily eye, unillumined and\r\nunvivified by the light and movement of principles, of which forms are\r\nbut the exponents. It will not be an exhibition of the relations which\r\nconventionalisms mutually bear, however fine may be the perception, and\r\nhowever clever the presentation may be. Further than this American\r\nliterature has, as yet, produced nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason, besides those which have been mentioned, why it\r\nwould be highly unjust and injurious to conclude that there is nothing\r\nmore in the nation's heart and brain than has come out before the eye.\r\nThe American nation is made up of contributions from almost all other\r\ncivilised nations: and, though the primary truths of God, and the\r\nuniversal characteristics of Man are common to them all, there are\r\ninfinite diversities to be blended into unity before a national\r\ncharacter can arise; before a national mind can be seen to actuate the\r\nmass of society. It is probable that the first great work of genius that\r\nappears will be the most powerful instrument for effecting this blending\r\nand reconciling: but the appearance of such a work is doubtless retarded\r\nin proportion to the checks and repression of social sympathy, caused by\r\nthe diversity of influences under which society proceeds. The tuning for\r\nthe concert has begun; some captious persons are grumbling at the\r\ndiscord; some inexperienced expectants take a wail here, and a flourish\r\nthere, to be music: but the hour has not struck. The leader has not yet\r\ncome to his place, to play the chord which shall bring the choral\r\nresponse that must echo over the world.\r\n\r\nI saw the house which Berkeley built in Rhode Island,--built in the\r\nparticular spot where it is, that he might have to pass, in his rides,\r\nover the hill which lies between it and Newport, and feast himself with\r\nthe tranquil beauty of the sea, the bay and the downs, as they appear\r\nfrom the ridge of the eminence. I saw the pile of rocks, with its ledges\r\nand recesses, where he is said to have meditated and composed his\r\n\"Minute Philosopher.\" It was at first melancholy to visit these his\r\nretreats, and think how empty the land still is of the philosophy he\r\nloved. But the more one sees of the people, and the less of their books,\r\nthe stronger grows the hope of the stranger. One finds the observation\r\nof many turned inwards. Fragments of spiritual visions occur to one and\r\nanother. Though some dogmatise, and others wait for revelation, and none\r\nseem to remember the existence of the experimental method, still there\r\nis a reaching after the Philosophy of Mind. At Harvard University, the\r\nchair of Mental Philosophy has been vacant for above eight years: it\r\nhaving been the custom formerly to indoctrinate the students with a\r\ncertain number of chapters of Locke; and no man being now found hardy\r\nenough to undertake to discharge the duty thus; and the way not being\r\nyet clear to any one who would lay open the whole field of this\r\nphilosophy, and let the students gather what they could out of it. Such\r\nimpediments do not exist beyond the walls; and many young minds are at\r\nwork without guidance, to whom guidance, however acceptable, is not\r\nnecessary. If the lectures which are given to young ladies, who are\r\ncarefully misinformed from Reid and Stewart,--if the reviews and\r\npanegyrics of Dr. Brown, hazarded without the slightest conception of\r\nthe nature and extent of his meaning, are likely to throw the observer\r\ninto despair;--if he is amazed to see a coterie disputing upon the\r\nultimate principles perceived by Pure Reason, while he finds within\r\nhimself no evidence of the existence of this Pure Reason, and believes\r\nthat if it did universally exist, ultimate principles could admit of no\r\ndispute,--he is yet cheered by finding, not only eagerness in the\r\npursuit of the philosophical ideas of others, but traces of some\r\noriginality of speculation. There is a little book, by a Swedenborgian,\r\ncalled \"The Growth of the Mind,\" which is, I believe unquestionably, an\r\noriginal work. From its originality, and the beauty of some of its\r\nimages, and yet more of its exhibition of certain relations, it is\r\nhighly interesting, though it is not found to command that extensive\r\nassent, which is the only guarantee of the soundness of works on the\r\nPhilosophy of Mind. Mankind may demur for ages to the earth being round,\r\nand to its moving through space; but where the primary appeal, as in the\r\nPhilosophy of Mind, must be to consciousness, works which do not command\r\nassent to their fundamental positions are failures as philosophy, though\r\nthey may have inferior merits and attractions.\r\n\r\nThe best productions of American literature are, in my opinion, the\r\ntales and sketches in which the habits and manners of the people of the\r\ncountry are delineated, with exactness, with impartiality of temper, and\r\nwithout much regard to the picturesque. Such are the tales of Judge Hall\r\nof Cincinnati. Such are the tales by the author of Swallow Barn; where,\r\nhowever, there is the addition of a good deal of humour, and a\r\nsubtraction of some of the truth. Miss Sedgwick's tales are of the\r\nhighest order of the three, from the moral beauty which they breathe.\r\nThis moral beauty is of a much finer character than the _bonhommie_\r\nwhich is the charm of Irving's pictures of manners. She sympathises\r\nwhere he good-naturedly observes; she cheerily loves where he gently\r\nquizzes. Miss Sedgwick's novels have this moral beauty too; as has\r\neverything she touches: but they have great and irretrievable faults as\r\nworks of art. Tale-writing is her forte: and in this vocation, no one\r\nwho has observed her striking progression will venture to say what she\r\nmay not achieve.\r\n\r\nAmong the host of tales which appear without the names of their authors\r\nare three, which strike me as excellent in their several ways: \"Allen\r\nPrescott,\" containing the history of a New England boy, drawn to the\r\nlife, and in a just and amiable spirit: \"The New England Housekeeper,\"\r\nin which the _ménage_ of a rising young lawyer, with its fresh joys and\r\nludicrous perplexities, is humorously exhibited: and \"Memoirs of a New\r\nEngland Village Choir,\" a sketch of even higher merit.\r\n\r\nIrving's writings have had their meed. He has lived in the sunshine of\r\nfame for many years, and in the pleasant consciousness that he has been\r\na benefactor to the present generation, by shedding some gentle,\r\nbenignant, and beguiling influences on many intervals of their rough and\r\nbusy lives. More than this he has probably not expected; and more than\r\nthis he does not seem likely to achieve. If any of his works live, it\r\nwill be his Columbus: and the later of his productions will be the first\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nCooper's novels have a very puny vitality. Some descriptions of scenery,\r\nand some insulated adventures, have great merit: but it is not human\r\nlife that he presents. His female characters are far from human; and in\r\nhis selections of the chances of mortal existence, he usually chooses\r\nthe remotest. He has a vigour of perception and conception, which might\r\nhave made him, with study and discipline, a great writer. As it is, he\r\nis, I believe, regarded as a much-regretted failure.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have a poet. Bryant has not done anything like what he can\r\nand will do: but he has done some things that will live. Those of his\r\npoems which are the best known, or the most quoted, are smooth, sweet,\r\nfaithful descriptions of nature, such as his own imagination delights\r\nin. I shall always remember the voice and manner with which he took up a\r\ncasual remark of mine, about sights to be seen in the pine-barrens. When\r\nthe visitors had all departed, his question \"And what of the\r\npine-barrens?\" revealed the spirit of the poet. Of his poems of this\r\nclass, \"The Evening Wind\" is to me the most delicious. But others,--\"The\r\nPast,\" and \"Thanatopsis\"--indicate another kind, and a higher degree of\r\npower. If he would live for his gifts, if his future years could be\r\ndevoted to \"clear poetical activity,\" \"looking up,\" like the true\r\nartist, \"to his dignity and his calling,\" that dignity and that calling\r\nmay prove to be as lofty as they no doubt appeared in the reveries of\r\nhis boyhood; and he may be listened to as lovingly over the expanse of\r\nfuture time, as he already is over that of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have also a historian of promise. Mr. Bancroft's History\r\nof the United States is little more than begun: but the beginning is\r\ncharacterised by an impartial and benevolent spirit, and by the\r\nindications which it affords of the author's fidelity to democratic\r\nprinciples; the two primary requisites in a historian of the republic.\r\nThe carrying on the work to a completion will be a task of great toil\r\nand anxiety: but it will be a most important benefit to society at\r\nlarge, if it fulfils its promise.\r\n\r\nThe periodical literature of the United States is of a very low order.\r\nI know of no review where anything like impartial, enlightened criticism\r\nis to be found. The North American Review had once some reputation in\r\nEngland; but it has sunk at home and abroad, less from want of talent\r\nthan of principle. If it has any principle whatever at present, it seems\r\nto be to praise every book it mentions, and to fall in as dexterously as\r\npossible with popular prejudice. The American Quarterly, published at\r\nPhiladelphia, is uninteresting from the triteness of its morals, and a\r\ngeneral dearth of thought, amidst a good deal of cleverness. The\r\nSouthern Review, published at Charleston,--sometime ago discontinued,\r\nbut I believe lately renewed,--is the best specimen of periodical\r\nliterature that the country has afforded. After the large deductions\r\nrendered necessary by the faults of southern temper, this Review\r\nmaintains its place above the rest; a rank which is, I believe,\r\nundisputed.\r\n\r\nI met with one gem in American literature, where I should have least\r\nexpected it:--in the Knickerbocker; a New York Monthly Magazine. Last\r\nspring, a set of papers began to appear, called \"Letters from\r\nPalmyra,\"[28] six numbers of which had been issued when I left the\r\ncountry. I have been hitherto unable to obtain the rest: but if they\r\nanswer to the early portions, there can be no doubt of their being\r\nshortly in everybody's hands, in both countries. These letters remain in\r\nmy mind, after repeated readings, as a fragment of lofty and tender\r\nbeauty. Zenobia, Longinus, and a long perspective of characters, live\r\nand move in natural majesty; and the beauties of description and\r\nsentiment appear to me as remarkable as the strong conception of\r\ncharacter, and of the age. If this anonymous fragment be not the work of\r\na true artist,--if the work, when entire, do not prove to be of a far\r\nhigher order than anything which has issued from the American\r\npress,--its early admirers will feel yet more surprise than regret.\r\n\r\nIt is continually said, on both sides of the water, and with much truth,\r\nthat the bad state of the laws of literary property is answerable for\r\nsome of the depression of American literature. It is true that the\r\nimperfection of these laws inflicts various discouragements on American\r\nwriters, while it is disgracefully injurious to foreign authors. It is\r\ntrue that American booksellers will not remunerate native authors while\r\nthey can purloin the works of British writers: and that the American\r\npublic has a strong disposition to listen to the utterance of the\r\nEnglish in preference to the prophets of their own country. It is true\r\nthat in America, where every man must work for his living, it is a\r\ndiscouragement to the pursuit of literature that a living cannot, except\r\nin a few rare cases, be got by it. But all this is no solution of the\r\nfact of the non-existence of literature in America: which fact is indeed\r\nno mystery. The present state of the law, by which the works of English\r\nauthors are pirated, undefended against mutilation, and made to drive\r\nnative works out of the market, is so conspicuously bad, that there is\r\nevery prospect of a speedy alteration: but there is nothing in the abuse\r\nwhich can silence genius, if genius is wanting to speak. It ought by\r\nthis time to be understood that there is no power on earth which can\r\nrepress mental force of the highest kinds; which can stifle the\r\nutterance of a thoroughly-moved spirit: certainly no power which is held\r\nby piratical booksellers under defective laws. Such discouragement is\r\nunjust and harsh; but it cannot be fatal. If a native genius, of a far\r\nhigher order than any English, had been existing in America for the last\r\nten years, he would have made himself heard ere this, and won his way\r\ninto the general mind and heart through a host of bookselling harpies,\r\nand a chaos of lawlessness: he would have done this, even if it had been\r\nnecessary to give his dinner for paper, and sell his bed to pay the\r\nprinter;--expedients which it is scarcely conceivable that any author in\r\nthat thriving land should be driven to. The absence of protection to\r\nforeign literary property is injurious enough, without its being made\r\nanswerable for the deficiency of literary achievement. The causes lie\r\ndeeper, and will not have ceased to operate till long after the law\r\nshall have been made just in this particular.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the literary taste of the country may be arrived at through\r\na mention of what appeared to me to be the comparative popularity of\r\nliving or recent British authors.\r\n\r\nI heard no name so often as Mrs. Hannah More's. She is much better known\r\nin the country than Shakspeare. This is, of course, an indication of the\r\nreligious taste of the people; and the fact bears only a remote relation\r\nto literature. Scott is idolised; and so is Miss Edgeworth; but I think\r\nno one is so much read as Mr. Bulwer. I question whether it is possible\r\nto pass half a day in general society without hearing him mentioned. He\r\nis not worshipped with the dumb self-surrendering reverence with which\r\nMiss Edgeworth is regarded: but his books are in every house; his\r\noccasional democratic aspirations are in every one's mouth; and the\r\nmorality of his books is a constant theme of discussion, from among the\r\nmost sensitive of the clergy down to the \"thinking, thoughtless\r\nschool-boy\" and his chum. The next name is, decidedly, Mrs. Jameson's.\r\nShe is altogether a favourite; and her \"Characteristics of Women\" is\r\nthe book which has made her so. At a considerable distance follows Mrs.\r\nHemans. Byron is scarcely heard of. Wordsworth lies at the heart of the\r\npeople. His name may not be so often spoken as some others; but I have\r\nlittle doubt that his influence is as powerful as that of any whom I\r\nhave mentioned. It is less diffused, but stronger. His works are not to\r\nbe had at every store; but within people's houses they lie under the\r\npillow, or open on the work-box, or they peep out of the coat-pocket:\r\nthey are marked, re-marked, and worn. Coleridge is the delight of a few.\r\nSo is Lamb; regarded, however, with a more tender love. I heard Mr.\r\nHallam's name seldom, but always in a tone of extraordinary respect, and\r\nfrom those whose respect is most valuable.\r\n\r\nNo living writer, however, exercises so enviable a sway, as far as it\r\ngoes, as Mr. Carlyle. It is remarkable that an influence like his should\r\nhave been gained through scattered articles of review and speculation,\r\nspread over a number of years and a variety of periodicals. The\r\nAmericans have his \"Life of Schiller;\" but it was not that. His articles\r\nin the Edinburgh Review met the wants of several of the best minds in\r\nthe society of New England; minds weary of cant, and mechanical morals,\r\nand seeking something truer to rest upon. The discipleship immediately\r\ninstituted is honourable to both. Mr. Carlyle's remarkable work, \"Sartor\r\nResartus,\" issued piecemeal through Fraser's Magazine, has been\r\nrepublished in America, and is exerting an influence proportioned to the\r\ngenuineness of the admiration it has excited. Perhaps this is the first\r\ninstance of the Americans having taken to their hearts an English work\r\nwhich came to them anonymously, unsanctioned by any recommendation, and\r\neven absolutely neglected at home. The book is acting upon them with\r\nwonderful force. It has regenerated the preaching of more than one of\r\nthe clergy; and, I have reason to believe, the minds and lives of\r\nseveral of the laity. It came as a benefactor to meet a pressing want;\r\nhow pressing, the benefited testify by the fervour of their gratitude.\r\n\r\nI know of no method by which the Americans could be assisted to utter\r\nwhat they may have in them so good as one which has been proposed, but\r\nwhich is not yet, I believe, in course of trial. It has been proposed\r\nthat a publication should be established, open to the perfectly full and\r\nfree discussion of every side of every question, within a certain\r\ndepartment of inquiry;--Social Morals, for instance. There are\r\ndifficulties at present in the way of presenting the whole of any\r\nsubject to the public mind; difficulties arising from the unprincipled\r\npartiality of the common run of newspapers, the cautious policy of\r\nreviewers, the fear of opinion entertained by individual writers, and\r\nthe impediments thrown in the way of free publication by the state of\r\nthe laws relating to literary property. A publication devoted to the\r\nobject of presenting, without fear or favour, all that can be said on\r\nany subject, without any restriction, except in the use of personalities\r\ntowards opponents, would be the best possible remedy, under the\r\ncircumstances, for the inconveniences complained of; the finest stimulus\r\nto the ascertainment of truth; the best education in the art of free and\r\ndistinct utterance. A publication like this, under the editorship of\r\nsuch a man as Dr. Follen, a man full of learning, philosophy, and that\r\ndevout love of truth which is a guarantee of impartiality, would be a\r\nhigh honour to the country, and a good lesson to some older societies,\r\nfrom which the fear of free discussion has not yet vanished. An editor\r\nworthy of the work would decline the responsibility of suppressing any\r\nviews, coming within the range of subjects embraced. He would merely\r\nweed out personalities; cherish the spirit of justice and charity; and\r\nfor the sake of these, strengthen the weaker side, where he saw that it\r\nwas inadequately defended. It may be said that editors who would thus\r\ndischarge their function are rare. They are so: but there is Dr. Follen;\r\na living reply to the objection.\r\n\r\nI have not the apprehension which some entertain that such a publication\r\nwould be feared and rejected by the public. At first, it would excite\r\nsome surprise and perplexity; one-sidedness being so generally the\r\ncharacteristic of periodicals in America, that it would take some time\r\nto convey the idea of a consistent opposite practice. But the American\r\npublic has given no evidence of a dislike to be made acquainted with\r\ntruth; but quite the contrary. My own conviction is, that before two\r\nyears from its commencement, such a work would be in the houses of all\r\nthe honest thinkers and most principled doers in the country; and that\r\neloquent voices would, by its means, make themselves heard from many a\r\nremote dwelling-place; using with delight their means of utterance; and\r\nproving that the dearth of American literature is not owing to vacuity\r\nof thought or deadness of feeling. At any rate, such an experiment would\r\nascertain whether the want is of means of utterance, or of something to\r\nutter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[28] \"Letters of Lucius M. Piso, from Palmyra, to his friend Marcus\r\nCurtius, at Rome: now first translated and published.\" They present a\r\npicture of the state of the East in the reign of Aurelian; and are to\r\nend, I suppose, with the fall of Palmyra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nRELIGION.\r\n\r\n     \"Der Grund aller Democratie; die höchste Thatsache der\r\n     Popularität.\"\r\n\r\n     _Novalis._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The Christian Religion is the root of all democracy; the highest\r\n     fact in the Rights of Man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion is the highest fact in the Rights of Man from its being the\r\nmost exclusively private and individual, while it is also a universal,\r\nconcern, of any in which man is interested.

It\r\nis in this widest sense that some speculative atheists have been\r\nreligious men; religious in their efforts after self-perfection; though\r\nunable to personify their conception of the Infinite.

Any account of religion\r\nwhich restricts it within the boundaries of any system, which connects\r\nit with any mode of belief, which implicates it with hope of reward or\r\nfear of punishment, is low and injurious, and debases religion into\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nThe Christian religion is specified as being the highest fact in the\r\nrights of man from its embodying (with all the rest) the principle of\r\nnatural religion--that religion is at once an individual, an universal,\r\nand an equal concern. In it may be found a sanction of all just claims\r\nof political and social equality; for it proclaims, now in music and now\r\nin thunder,--it blazons, now in sunshine and now in lightning,--the fact\r\nof the natural equality of men. In giving forth this as its grand\r\ndoctrine, it is indeed \"the root of all democracy;\" the root of the\r\nmaxim (among others) that among the inalienable rights of all men are\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The democracy of America is\r\nplanted down deep into the christian religion; into its principles,\r\nwhich it has in common with natural religion, and which it vivifies and\r\nillumines, but does not alter.\r\n\r\nHow does the existing state of religion accord with the promise of its\r\nbirth? In a country which professes to secure to every man the pursuit\r\nof happiness in his own way, what is the state of his liberty in the\r\nmost private and individual of all concerns? How carefully are all men\r\nand women left free from interference in following up their own\r\naspirations after the Infinite, in realising their own ideas of\r\nperfection, in bringing into harmonious action the functions of their\r\nspirits, as infinitely diversified as the expression of their features?\r\n\r\nThe absence of such diversity is the first striking fact which presents\r\nitself on the institution of such an inquiry. If there were no\r\nconstraint,--no social reward or penalty,--such an approach to\r\nuniformity of profession could not exist as is seen in the United\r\nStates. In a society where speculation and profession were left\r\nperfectly free, as included among the inalienable rights of man, there\r\nwould be many speculative (though probably extremely few practical)\r\natheists: there would be an adoption by many of the principles of\r\nnatural religion, otherwise than in and through Christianity: and\r\nChristianity would be adopted in modes as various as the minds by which\r\nit would be recognised. Instead of this, we find laws framed against\r\nspeculative atheists: opprobrium directed upon such as embrace natural\r\nreligion otherwise than through Christianity: and a yet more bitter\r\noppression exercised by those who view Christianity in one way, over\r\nthose who regard it in another. A religious young christian legislator\r\nwas pitied, blamed, and traduced in Boston, last year, by clergymen,\r\nlawyers, and professors of a college, for endeavouring to obtain a\r\nrepeal of the law under which the testimony of speculative atheists is\r\nrejected in courts of justice: Quakers (calling themselves Friends)\r\nexcommunicate each other: Presbyterian clergymen preach hatred to\r\nCatholics: a convent is burnt, and the nuns are banished from the\r\nneighbourhood: and Episcopalian clergymen claim credit for admitting\r\nUnitarians to sit in committees for public objects! As might be expected\r\nunder such an infringement of the principle of securing to every man the\r\npursuit of happiness in his own way, there is no such endless diversity\r\nin the action of minds, and utterance of tongues, as nature and fidelity\r\nto truth peremptorily demand. Truth is deprived of the irrefragable\r\ntestimony which would be afforded by whatever agreement might arise\r\namidst this diversity: religion is insulted and scandalised by nominal\r\nadherence and hypocritical advocacy. There are many ways of professing\r\nChristianity in the United States: but there are few, very few men,\r\nwhether speculative or thoughtless, whether studious or ignorant,\r\nwhether reverent or indifferent, whether sober or profligate, whether\r\ndisinterested or worldly, who do not carefully profess Christianity, in\r\nsome form or another. This, as men are made, is unnatural. Society\r\npresents no faithful mirror of the religious perspective of the human\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether this is not true of the Old World also. It is.\r\nBut the society of the Old World has not yet grasped in practice any one\r\nfundamental democratic principle: and the few who govern the many have\r\nnot yet perceived that religion is \"the root of all democracy:\" they are\r\nso far from it that they are still upholding an established form of\r\nreligion; in which a particular mode of belief is enforced upon minds by\r\nthe imposition of virtual rewards and punishments. The Americans have\r\nlong taken higher ground; repudiating establishments, and professing to\r\nleave religion free. They must be judged by their own principles, and\r\nnot by the example of societies whose errors they have practically\r\ndenounced by their adoption of the Voluntary Principle.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal profession in America of the adoption of\r\nChristianity,--this profession by many whose habits of thought, and\r\nothers whose habits of living forbid the supposition that it is the\r\nreligion of their individual intellects and affections, compels the\r\ninquiry what sort of Christianity it is that is professed, and how it is\r\ncome by. There is no evading the conviction that it is to a vast extent\r\na monstrous superstition that is thus embraced by the tyrant, the\r\nprofligate, the worldling, the bigot, the coward, and the slave; a\r\nsuperstition which offers little molestation to their vices, little\r\nrectification to their errors; a superstition which is but the spurious\r\noffspring of that divine Christianity which \"is the root of all\r\ndemocracy, the highest fact in the Rights of Man.\" That so many of the\r\nmeek, pure, disinterested, free, and brave, make the same profession,\r\nproves only that they penetrate to religion through superstition; or\r\nthat they cast away unconsciously the superstition with which their\r\nspirits have no affinity, and accept such truth as all superstition must\r\ninclude in order to live.\r\n\r\nThe only test by which religion and superstition can be ultimately tried\r\nis that with which they co-exist. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian body is a very large one; the total number in\r\ncommunion, according to the minutes of the General Assembly for 1834,\r\nbeing then 247,964. New England contains a very small, and the south and\r\nwest a very large, proportion of the body. Some of the most noble of the\r\nabolitionists of the north are Presbyterians; and from the lips and pens\r\nof Presbyterians in the south, come some of the defences of slavery\r\nwhich evince the deepest depravity of principle and feeling. This is\r\nonly another proof, added to the million, that religion comes out of\r\nmorals. In the words of a pure moralist,[29] \"Morality is usually said\r\nto depend upon religion; but this is said in that low sense in which\r\noutward conduct is considered as morality. In that higher sense in which\r\nmorality denotes sentiment, it is more exactly true to say, that\r\nreligion depends on morality, and springs from it. Virtue is not the\r\nconformity of outward actions to a rule; nor is religion the fear of\r\npunishment, or the hope of reward. Virtue is the state of a just,\r\nprudent, benevolent, firm, and temperate mind. Religion is the whole of\r\nthose sentiments which such a mind feels towards an infinitely perfect\r\nbeing.\" With these views, we may account for the different morality of\r\nthe Presbyterians of the south from that of such of the friends of the\r\nslave in the north as are of the same communion. Of the Presbyterian, as\r\nwell as other clergy of the south, some are even planters,\r\nsuperintending the toils of their slaves, and making purchases, or\r\neffecting sales in the slave-markets, during the week, and preaching on\r\nSundays whatever they can devise that is least contradictory to their\r\ndaily practice. I watched closely the preaching in the south,--that of\r\nall denominations,--to see what could be made of Christianity, \"the\r\nhighest fact in the Rights of Man,\" in such a region. I found the\r\nstricter religionists preaching reward and punishment in connexion with\r\nmodes of belief, and hatred to the Catholics. I found the more\r\nphilosophical preaching for or against materialism, and diverging to\r\nphrenology. I found the more quiet and \"gentlemanly\" preaching harmless\r\nabstractions,--the four seasons, the attributes of the Deity, prosperity\r\nand adversity, &c. I heard one clergyman, who always goes out of the\r\nroom when the subject of negro emancipation is mentioned, or when\r\nslavery is found fault with, preach in a southern city against following\r\na multitude to do evil. I heard one noble religious discourse from the\r\nRev. Joel Parker, a Presbyterian clergyman, of New Orleans; but except\r\nthat one, I never heard any available reference made to the grand truths\r\nof religion, or principles of morals. The great principles which regard\r\nthe three relations to God, man, and self,--striving after perfection,\r\nmutual justice and charity, and christian liberty,--were never touched\r\nupon.--Meantime, the clergy were pretending to find express sanctions of\r\nslavery in the Bible; and putting words to this purpose into the mouths\r\nof public men, who do not profess to remember the existence of the\r\nBible in any other connexion. The clergy were boasting at public\r\nmeetings, that there was not a periodical south of the Potomac which did\r\nnot advocate slavery; and some were even setting up a magazine, whose\r\n\"fundamental principle is, that man ought to be the property of man.\"\r\nThe clergy, who were to be sent as delegates to the General Assembly,\r\nwere receiving instructions to leave the room, if the subject of slavery\r\nwas mentioned; and to propose the cessation of the practice of praying\r\nfor slaves. At the same time, the wife of a clergyman called upon me to\r\nadmire the benevolent toils of a friend, who had been \"putting up 4000\r\nweight of pork\" for her slave household: and another lady, kindly and\r\nreligiously disposed, told me what pains she took on Sunday mornings to\r\nteach her slaves, by word of mouth, as much of Christianity as was good\r\nfor them. When I pressed her on the point as to why they were to have\r\nChristianity and not the alphabet, and desired to know under what\r\nauthority she dared to keep from them knowledge, which God has shed\r\nabroad for all, as freely as the the air and sunshine, I found that the\r\nidea was wholly new to her: nothing that she had heard in church, or out\r\nof it, from any of the Christians among whom she lived, had awakened the\r\nsuspicion that she was robbing her brethren of their birth-right. The\r\nreligion of the south strictly accords with the morals of the south.\r\nThere is much that is gentle, merciful, and generous: much among the\r\nsuffering women that is patient, heroic, and inspiring meek resignation.\r\nAmong these victims, there is faith, hope, and charity. But Christianity\r\nis severed from its radical principles of justice and liberty; and it\r\nwill have to be cast out as a rotten branch.\r\n\r\nA southern clergyman mentioned to me, obviously with difficulty and\r\npain, that though he was as happily placed as a minister could be,\r\ntreated with friendliness and generosity by his people, and so cherished\r\nas to show that they were satisfied, he had one trouble. During all the\r\nyears of his ministry, no token had reached him that he had religiously\r\nimpressed their minds, more or less. They met regularly and decorously\r\non Sundays, and departed quietly, and there was an end. He did not know\r\nthat any one discourse had affected them more than any other; and no\r\nopportunity was offered him of witnessing any religious emotion among\r\nthem whatever.--Another, an Unitarian clergyman of the south, was known\r\nto lament the appearance of Dr. Channing's work on slavery, \"the cause\r\nwas going on so well before!\" \"The cause going on!\" exclaimed another\r\nUnitarian clergyman in the north; \"what should the ship go on for, when\r\nthey have thrown both captain and cargo overboard?\"\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said of the southern fruits of \"the root of all\r\ndemocracy?\" Excluding the debased slaves, and the helpless, suffering\r\nvictims of the system, there remain the laity, who, as they do not\r\nabolish slavery, must be concluded not to understand the religion with\r\nwhose principles it cannot coexist; and the acquiescing clergy, who, if\r\nthey do not understand its principles, are unfit to be clergymen: and if\r\nthey do, are unfit to be called Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterians of the south have reason to perceive that the\r\nprinciples of christian liberty are not fully embraced by their brethren\r\nof the north, though acted upon by some with a disinterested heroism in\r\nthe direction of abolition. Those who would exclude slave-holders from\r\nthe communion-table are usurping an authority which the principles of\r\ntheir religion forbid. The hatred to the Catholics also approaches too\r\nnearly in its irreligious character to the oppression of the negro. It\r\nis pleaded by some who most mourn the persecution the Catholics are at\r\npresent undergoing in the United States, that there is a very prevalent\r\nignorance on the subject of the Catholic religion; and that dreadful\r\nslanders are being circulated by a very few wicked, which deceive a\r\ngreat many weak, persons. This is just the case: but there is that in\r\nthe true christian religion which should intercept the hatred, whatever\r\nmay be the ignorance. There is that in the true christian religion which\r\nshould give the lie to those slanders, in the absence of all outward\r\nevidence of their untruth. There is that in true Christianity which\r\nshould chasten the imagination, allay faithless apprehensions, and\r\ninspire a trust that, as heart answers to heart, no vast body of men can\r\never bind themselves by the name of Jesus, to become all that is most\r\nthe reverse of holy, harmless, and undefiled. The question \"where is thy\r\nfaith?\" might reasonably have been put to the Presbyterian clergyman who\r\npreached three long denunciations against the Catholics in Boston, the\r\nSunday before the burning of the Charlestown convent: and also to\r\nparents, who can put into their children's hands, as religious books,\r\nthe foul libels against the Catholics which are circulated throughout\r\nthe country. In the west, I happened to find in the chamber of a very\r\nyoung lady, the only child of an opulent and influential citizen, a book\r\nof this kind, which no epithet but filthy will suit. It lay with her\r\nBible and Prayer-book; the secular part of her library being disposed\r\nelsewhere. If religion springs from morals, those who put the book into\r\nthe hands of this young girl will be answerable, if her religion should\r\nbe as little like that which is \"first pure, then peaceable,\" as their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI was seriously told, by several persons in the south and west, that\r\nthe Catholics of America were employed by the Pope, in league with the\r\nEmperor of Austria and the Irish, to explode the Union. The vast and\r\nrapid spread of the Catholic faith in the United States has excited\r\nobservation, which grew into this rumour. I believe the truth to be\r\nthat, in consequence of the Pope's wish to keep the Catholics of America\r\na colonial church, and the Catholics of the country thinking themselves\r\nnow sufficiently numerous to be an American Catholic church, a great\r\nstimulus has been given to proselytism. This has awakened fear and\r\npersecution; which last has, again, been favourable to the increase of\r\nthe sect. While the Presbyterians preach a harsh, ascetic, persecuting\r\nreligion, the Catholics dispense a mild and indulgent one; and the\r\nprodigious increase of their numbers is a necessary consequence. It is\r\nfound so impossible to supply the demand for priests, that the term of\r\neducation has been shortened by two years.--Those observers who have\r\nmade themselves familiar with the modes in which institutions, even of\r\nthe most definite character, adapt themselves to the wants of the time,\r\nwill not be made uneasy by the spread of a religion so flexible in its\r\nforms as the Catholic, among a people so intelligent as the Americans.\r\nThe Catholic body is democratic in its politics, and made up from the\r\nmore independent kind of occupations. The Catholic religion is modified\r\nby the spirit of the time in America; and its professors are not a set\r\nof men who can be priest-ridden to any fatal extent. If they are let\r\nalone, and treated on genuine republican principles, they may show us\r\nhow the true, in any old form of religion, may be separated from the\r\nfalse, till, the eye being made clear, the whole body will be full of\r\nlight. If they cannot do this, their form of religion will decay, or at\r\nleast remain harmless; for it is assuredly too late now for a return of\r\nthe dark ages. At all events, every American is required by his\r\ndemocratic principles to let every man alone about his religion. He may\r\ndo with the religion what seems to him good; study, controvert, adopt,\r\nreject, speak, write, or preach, whatever he perceives and thinks about\r\nits doctrines and its abuses: but with its professors he has nothing to\r\ndo, further than religiously to observe his fraternal relation to them;\r\nsuffering no variance of opinion to seduce him into a breach of the\r\nrepublican and christian brotherhood to which he is pledged.\r\n\r\nWhat other fruits are there of the superstition which pervades society,\r\ncomprehending under the term Christian many who know little of its\r\ndoctrine, and exhibit less of its spirit? The state and treatment of\r\ninfidelity are some of the worst.\r\n\r\nThere is in this respect a dreadful infringement on human rights\r\nthroughout the north; though a better spirit is being cherished and\r\nextended by a few who see how contrary to all christian and all\r\ndemocratic principles it is that a man should be the worse for his\r\nopinions in society. I have seen enough to know how little chance\r\nChristianity has in consequence of this infringement. I know that very\r\nlarge numbers of people are secretly disinclined to cherish what is\r\nimposed upon them, with perpetual and unvarying modes of observance,\r\nfrom their childhood up; and how the disgust grows from the opprobrium\r\nwith which unbelief is visited. I know that there are minds in New\r\nEngland, as everywhere else, which must, from their very structure, pass\r\nthrough a state of scepticism on their way to stability; and that such\r\nare surrounded with snares, such as no man should lay in his brother's\r\npath; with temptations to hypocrisy, to recklessness, to despair; and to\r\nan abdication of their human prerogative of reason, as well as\r\nconscience. I know how women, in whom the very foundations of belief\r\nhave been ploughed up by the share of authority, go wearily to church,\r\nSunday after Sunday, to hear what they do not believe; lie down at night\r\nfull of self-reproach for a want of piety which they do not know how to\r\nattain; and rise up in the morning hopelessly, seeing nothing in the day\r\nbefore them but the misery of carrying their secret concealed from\r\nparents, husband, sisters, friends. I know how young men are driven into\r\nvice, by having only the alternative of conformity or opprobrium:\r\nfeeling it impossible to believe what is offered them; feeling it to be\r\nno crime to disbelieve: but, seeing unbelief treated as crime, and\r\nthemselves under suspicion of it, losing faith in others and in\r\nthemselves, and falling in reality at last. All this, and very much\r\nmore, I know to be happening. I was told of one and another, with an air\r\nof mystery, like that with which one is informed of any person being\r\ninsane, or intemperate, or insolvent, that so and so was thought to be\r\nan unbeliever. I was always tempted to reply, \"And so are you, in a\r\nthousand things, to which this neighbour of yours adds one.\"--An\r\nelderly, generally intelligent, benevolent gentleman told me that he\r\nwanted to see regulations made by which deists should be excluded from\r\noffice, and moral men only admitted. Happily, the community is not\r\nnearly so far gone in tyranny and folly as to entertain such a project\r\nas this: but it must be a very superstitious society where such an idea\r\ncould be deliberately expressed by a sane man.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance struck me throughout the country. Almost as often as\r\nthe conversation between myself and any other person on religious\r\nsubjects became intimate and earnest, I was met by the supposition that\r\nI was a convert. It was the same in other instances: wherever there was\r\na strong interest in the christian religion, conversion to a particular\r\nprofession of it was confidently supposed. This fact speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nHappy influences are at work to enlighten and enlarge the mind of\r\nsociety. One of the most powerful of these is the union of men and women\r\nof all religions in pursuit of objects of common interest; particularly\r\nin the abolition cause. Persons who were once ready to excommunicate\r\neach other are now loving friends in their mutual obedience to the\r\nweightier matters of the law. The churches in Boston, and even the other\r\npublic buildings, being guarded by the dragon of bigotry, so that even\r\nfaith, hope, and charity are turned back from the doors, a large\r\nbuilding is about to be erected for the use of all, deists not excepted,\r\nwho may desire to meet for purposes of free discussion. This is, at\r\nleast, an advance.\r\n\r\nA reflecting and eminently religious person was speculating with me one\r\nday, on the influences by which the human mind is the most commonly and\r\nthe most powerfully awakened to vivid and permanent religious\r\nsensibility. We brought cases and suppositions of its being now strong\r\nimpressions of the beauty and grandeur of nature; now grief, and now\r\njoy, and so on. My friend concluded that it was most frequently the\r\nspectacle of moral beauty in an individual. I have no doubt it is so:\r\nand if it be, what tremendous injury must be done to the highest parts\r\nof man's nature by the unprincipled tyranny of the religious world in\r\nthe republic! Men declare by this very tyranny how essential they\r\nconsider belief to be. Belief is essential,--not only to safety, but to\r\nexistence. Every mind lives by belief, as the body lives by the\r\natmosphere: but the objects and modes of belief must be various; and it\r\nis from disallowing this that superstition arises. If men must exercise\r\nthe mutual vigilance which their human affections prompt, it would be\r\nwell for religion and for themselves that they should note how much\r\ntheir brethren believe, rather than what they disbelieve: the amount\r\nwould be found so vast as immeasurably to distance the deficiency. If\r\nthis were done, religion would be found to be so safe that the\r\nproportions of sects, and the eccentricities of individuals would be\r\nlost sight of in the presence of universal, living, and breathing faith.\r\nI was told of a child who stood in the middle of a grass-plat, with its\r\narms by its sides, and listening with a countenance of intense\r\nexpectation, \"to hear God's tramp on that high blue floor.\" Who would\r\ncare to know what christian sect this child belonged to; or whether to\r\nany?--I was told of a father and mother, savages, who lost their only\r\nchild, and were overwhelmed with grief, under which the father soon\r\nsank. From the moment of his death, the solitary survivor recovered her\r\ncheerfulness. Being asked why, she said she had been miserable for her\r\nchild, lest he should be forlorn in the world of spirits: he had his\r\nfather with him now, and would be happy. Who would inquire for the creed\r\nof this example of disinterested love?--I was told of a young girl,\r\nbrought up from the country by a selfish betrayer, refused the marriage\r\nwhich had been promised, and turned out of doors by him on her being\r\nseized with the cholera. She was picked up from a doorstep, and carried\r\nto the hospital. In the midst of her dying agonies, no inducement could\r\nprevail on her to tell the name of her betrayer; and she died faithful\r\nto him, so that the secret of whose treachery we are abhorring is dead\r\nwith her. With such testimony that the very spirit of the gospel was in\r\nthis humble creature, none but those who would dare to cast her out for\r\nher fall would feel any anxiety as to how she received the facts of the\r\ngospel. Religion is safe, and would be seen to be so if we would set\r\nourselves to mark how universal are some few of men's convictions, and\r\nthe whole of man's affections. While men feel wonder, and the universe\r\nis wonderful; while men love natural glory, and the heavens and the\r\nearth are resplendent with it; while men revere holiness, and the beauty\r\nof holiness beams at times upon the dimmest sight, religion is safe. For\r\nthe last reason, Christianity is also safe. If the beauty of its\r\nholiness were never obscured by the defilements of human passion with\r\nwhich it is insulted, it is scarcely conceivable that all men would not\r\nbe, in some sense or other, Christians.\r\n\r\nThose who are certain that Christianity is safe, (and they are not a\r\nfew,) and who, therefore, beware of encroaching on their brother's\r\nliberty of conscience, will be found to be the most principled\r\nrepublicans, the firmest believers that Christianity is \"the root of all\r\ndemocracy: the highest fact in the Rights of Man.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[29] Sir James Mackintosh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE OF RELIGION.\r\n\r\n     \"And therefore the doctrine of the one (Christ) was never afraid of\r\n     universities, or endeavoured the banishment of learning like the\r\n     other (Mahomet.) And though Galen doth sometimes nibble at Moses,\r\n     and, beside the apostate Christian, some heathens have questioned\r\n     his philosophical part or treatise of the creation; yet there is\r\n     surely no reasonable Pagan that will not admire the rational and\r\n     well-grounded precepts of Christ, whose life, as it was conformable\r\n     unto his doctrine, so was that unto the highest rules of reason,\r\n     and must therefore flourish in the advancement of learning, and the\r\n     perfection of parts best able to comprehend it.\"\r\n\r\n     _Sir Thomas Browne._\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion has suffered from nothing, throughout all Christendom, more\r\nthan from its science having been mixed up with its spirit and practice.\r\nThe spirit and practice of religion come out of morals; but its science\r\ncomes out of history also; with chronology, philology, and other\r\ncollateral kinds of knowledge. The spirit and practice of religion are\r\nfor all, since all bear the same relation to their Creator and to their\r\nrace, and are endowed with reason and with affections. But the high\r\nscience of religion is, at present at least, like all other science, for\r\nthe few. The time may come when all shall have the comprehension of mind\r\nand range of knowledge which are requisite for investigating spiritual\r\nrelations, tracing the religious principle through all its\r\nmanifestations in individuals and societies, studying its records in\r\nmany languages, and testing the interpretations which have been put\r\nupon them, from age to age. The time may possibly come when all may be\r\nable thus to be scientific in theology: but that time has assuredly not\r\narrived. It is so far from being at hand, that by far the largest\r\nportion of christian society seems to be ignorant of the distinction\r\nbetween the science of theology and the practice of religion. The\r\nscientific study and popular administration of religion have not only\r\nbeen confided to the same persons, but actually mixed up and confounded\r\nin the heads and hands of those persons. Contrary to all principle, and\r\nto all practice in other departments, the student who enters upon this\r\nscience is warned beforehand what conclusions he must arrive at. The\r\nresults are given to him prior to investigation; and sanctioned by\r\nreward and punishment. The first injury happens to the student, under a\r\nmethod of pursuing science as barbarous as any by which the progress of\r\nnatural knowledge was retarded in ages gone by. The student, become an\r\nadministrator, next injures his flock in his turn, by mixing up portions\r\nof his scholastic science with religious sentiment. He teaches\r\ndogmatically that which bears no relation to duty and affection;\r\nrequiring assent where, for want of the requisite knowledge, true assent\r\nis impossible; where there can be only passive reception or ignorant\r\nrejection. The consequences are the corruptions of Christianity, which\r\ngrieve the spirit of those who see where and how the poison is mixed\r\nwith the bread of life.\r\n\r\nThe office of theological science is to preserve,--we must now say to\r\nrecover,--the primary simplicity of Christianity. It is a high and noble\r\noffice to penetrate to and test the opinions of ages, in order to trace\r\ncorruptions to their source, and separate them from the pure waters of\r\ntruth. It is a high and noble task to master the associations of the\r\nelder time, and look again at the gospel to see it afresh in its native\r\nlight. It is a high and noble task to strip away false glosses, not only\r\nof words but of ideas, that the true spirit of the gospel may shine\r\nthrough the record. But these high and noble labours are but means to a\r\nhigher and nobler end. The dignity of theological study arises from its\r\nbeing subservient to the administration of religion. The last was\r\nChrist's own office; the highest which can be discharged by man: so high\r\nas to indicate that when its dignity is fully understood, it will be\r\nconfided to the hands of no class of men. Theologians there will\r\nprobably always be; but no man will be a priest in those days to come\r\nwhen every man will be a worshipper.\r\n\r\nOn some accounts it may seem desirable that the theologians of this age\r\nshould be the clergy. It was once desirable; for reasons analogous to\r\nthose which constituted priests once the judges, then the politicians,\r\nthen the literati of society. It has been, and is, the plea that those\r\nwho professed to clear Christianity from its corruptions, and to master\r\nits history, were the fittest persons to present it to the popular mind.\r\n\r\nIf this were ever the case, the time seems to have passed by. The press\r\naffords the means of placing the clear results of theological inquiry in\r\nthe hands of those whom they concern. There seems to be no other\r\nrelation between the theologian, as a theologian, and the worshipper,\r\nwhich should constitute him the organ of their worship. The habits of\r\nmind most favourable to the pursuit of theological study are not those\r\nwhich qualify for a successful administration of religious influences.\r\nThis is proved by fact; by the limited efficacy of preaching, and by the\r\nfatal confusion which has been caused by the clergy having given out\r\nfragments of their studies from the pulpit, with annexations of promise\r\nand threatening. It does not follow that the administrators should be\r\nignorant; only that their knowledge should be other than scholastic and\r\ntechnical. The organ of a worshipping assembly should be furnished with\r\nthe clear results of theological study; and with such intellectual and\r\nmoral science as shall enable him, if his sympathies be warm enough, to\r\nidentify himself with the mind and heart of humanity. He must have that\r\nknowledge of men's relations and interests in life which shall enable\r\nhim to look into infinity from their point of view; to give voice to\r\nwhatever sentiments are common to all; to appeal to whatever affections\r\nand desires are stirring in all. For this purpose, he must be\r\npractically engaged in the great moral questions of the time, carrying\r\nthe principles of religion into them with his whole experimental force;\r\nand bringing out of them new light whereby to illustrate these\r\nprinciples, new grounds on which to reason in behalf of duty, and new\r\nforces with which to animate the convictions of his fellow-worshippers\r\ninto practice.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations through which the Methodist body in America, as well as\r\nelsewhere, is arriving at the true principle as to the ministering of\r\nreligion, are well known. First, they clearly saw the corruption of\r\nchristian doctrine and the deadness of religious service which must\r\nfollow from putting closet students into the pulpit: and, holding the\r\nbelief of immediate and special inspiration, they abjured human\r\nlearning. The mischiefs which have followed upon the ministry of\r\nignorant and fanatical clergy have converted large numbers to the\r\nadvocacy of human learning. It will probably yet be long before they can\r\nput in practice the true method of having one set of men to be\r\ntheologians, and another to be preachers or other organs of worship.\r\nThe complaint of every denomination in the United States is of a\r\nscarcity of ministers. This is so pressing that, as we have seen in the\r\ncase of the Catholics, the term of study is shortened. Now seems the\r\ntime, and America the place, for dispensing with the formalities which\r\nrestrict religious worship. It would be an incalculable injury to have\r\ntheological study brought to an end by every youth who devotes himself\r\nto it being called away to preach, before he can possibly possess many\r\nof the requisites for preaching. It would be far better to throw open\r\nthe office of administration to all who feel and can speak religiously,\r\nand so as to be the genuine voice of the thoughts of others. Even if it\r\nwere necessary to reconstitute religious societies, making the meetings\r\nfor worship smaller, and the exercises varying with the nature of the\r\ncase, there could no evil arise so serious as the interruption of\r\ntheological study, and the deterioration of public worship. In the wild\r\nwest, where the people can no more live without religion than they can\r\nanywhere else, the farmer's neighbours collect around him from within a\r\ncircuit of thirty miles, and he reads or speaks, and prays, and they are\r\nrefreshed. If this is not done, if it is not frequently done, the\r\nsettlers become liable to the insanity of camp-meetings and revivals. If\r\nthe national want can be thus naturally supplied in the heart of the\r\nforest or prairie, why not also in the city? The city has the advantage\r\nof a greater number of persons qualified to express the common desires,\r\nand meet the common sympathies of the worshippers.\r\n\r\nThere are enlightened and religious persons who think it would be a\r\ngreat advantage to religion if the present system of dogmatical\r\ntheological study in America were broken up. It might be so, if it were\r\nsure to be reconstituted upon better principles, and if it were not done\r\nfor the purpose of supplying the pulpit with men who might be even less\r\nfit for their office than they are now. But there is no prospect of such\r\na breaking up at present; and, I am afraid, as little of any great\r\nimprovement in the principles of research. Though there are differences\r\narising about creeds; though there are schisms within the walls of\r\nchurches and of colleges, and trials for heresy before synods and\r\nassemblies, which promise a more or less speedy relaxation of the bonds\r\nof creeds, and the tyranny of church government, there is no near\r\nprospect of theological science being left as free as other kinds. There\r\nis no near prospect of evidence on the most important of all subjects\r\nbeing consigned to the heaven-made laws of the human mind. There is no\r\nnear prospect of inquiry being left to work out its results, without any\r\nprior specification, under penalty, of what they must be. There is no\r\nnear prospect of the clergy having such faith in the religion they\r\nprofess as to leave it to the administration of Him who sent it, free\r\nfrom their pernicious and arrogant protection.\r\n\r\nIf other science had its results mixed up with hope and fear, its\r\npursuit watched over by tyranny, and divergence from old opinions\r\npunished by opprobrium, the world, instead of being \"an immense\r\nwhispering gallery, where the faintest accent of science is heard\r\nthroughout every civilised country as soon as uttered,\" would be a\r\nBabel; where all utterance would be vociferation, and life one\r\ninterminable quarrel. It would be an extreme exemplification of the\r\nprinciple of making convictions the object of moral approbation and\r\ndisapprobation. As it is, though natural philosophers sometimes fall\r\nout, yet there is a practical admission of the right of free research,\r\nand of the innocence of arriving, by strict fidelity, at any conclusions\r\nwhatever, in natural science. The consequence is that, instead of men\r\nbeing imprisoned for their discoveries, and made to do penance for the\r\nbenefits they confer on the community, science proceeds expeditiously\r\nand joyously, under the hands of intent workers, mutually aiding and\r\ncongratulating, while society gratefully accepts the results, and adopts\r\nthe knowledge evolved, as it becomes necessarily and regularly\r\npopularised.\r\n\r\nWhenever moral science shall be undertaken, and religious science\r\nemancipated, such will be the harmonious progress of each, and the\r\nchristian religion will be anew revealed to men. Meantime, the religious\r\nworld is in one aspect like an inquisition; in another, like a Babel.\r\nThe religious world: not by any means the intercourse of all religious\r\npersons. Some of the most religious persons are quite out of the\r\nreligious world; voluntarily retreating from it that they may retain\r\ntheir reverence; or driven from it, because they are faithful to\r\nconvictions which are prescribed to them only by God, without the\r\nsanction of man.\r\n\r\nIs it thus that religion should be followed and professed in a\r\ndemocratic republic? Does it carry with it any dispensation from\r\ndemocratic principles? any authority for despotism in this one\r\nparticular? any denial of human equality? any sanction of human\r\nauthority over reason and conscience? Is it not rather \"the root of all\r\ndemocracy; the highest fact in the Rights of Man?\" America has left it\r\nto the Old World to fortify Christianity by establishments, and has\r\ntriumphantly shown that a great nation may be trusted to its religious\r\ninstincts to provide for its religious wants. In order to the complete\r\nfollowing out of her principles, she must leave religious speculation\r\nand pursuit of knowledge and peace as open as any other; and beware of\r\nmaking the ascertainments of science an occasion for the oppression of a\r\nsingle individual in fortune, name, or natural inheritance of spiritual\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSPIRIT OF RELIGION.\r\n\r\n     \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of\r\n     love, and of a sound mind.\"\r\n\r\n    _Paul the Apostle._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Hands full of hearty labours: pains that pay\r\n     And prize themselves--do much that more they may.\r\n     No cruel guard of diligent cares, that keep\r\n     Crowned woes awake, as things too wise for sleep:\r\n     But reverend discipline, religious fear,\r\n     And soft obedience, find sweet biding here.\r\n     Silence, and sacred rest, peace and pure joys--\r\n     Kind loves keep house, lie close, and make no noise.\r\n     And room enough for monarchs, while none swells\r\n     Beyond the limits of contentful cells.\r\n     The self-remembering soul sweetly recovers\r\n     Her kindred with the stars: not basely hovers\r\n     Below--but meditates th' immortal way\r\n     Home to the source of light and intellectual day.\"\r\n\r\n     _Crashaw._\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety in America is as much in a transition state about religion as\r\nFrance and England are about politics. The people are in advance of the\r\nclergy in America, as the English are in advance of such of their\r\npolitical institutions as are in dispute. Discouraging as the aspect of\r\nreligious profession in America is on a superficial survey, a closer\r\nstudy will satisfy the observer that all will be well; that the most\r\ndemocratic of nations is religious at heart; and that its superstitions\r\nand offences against the spirit of Christianity are owing to temporary\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain what the spirit of religion really is in the\r\ncountry, we must not judge by the periodicals. Religious periodicals are\r\nalmost entirely in the hands of the clergy, who are in no country fair\r\nrepresentatives of the religion of the people. These periodicals are,\r\nalmost without exception, as far as my knowledge of them goes, extremely\r\nbad. A very few have some literary and scientific merit; and many\r\nadvocate with zeal particular methods of charity, and certainly effect a\r\nwide and beneficent co-operation for mutual help which could not be\r\notherwise so well secured. But arrogance and uncharitableness, cant,\r\nexclusiveness, and an utter absence of sympathy with human interests and\r\naffections, generally render this class of publications as distasteful\r\nas the corresponding organs of religious bodies in the Old World. They\r\nare too little human in their character, from the books of the Sunday\r\nSchool Union to the most important of the religious reviews, to be by\r\nany possibility a fair expression of the spiritual state of some\r\nmillions of persons. The acts of the laity, and especially of those who\r\nare least under the influence of the clergy, must be looked to as the\r\nonly true manifestations.\r\n\r\nIf religion springs from morals, the religion must be most faulty where\r\nthe morals are so. The greatest fault in American morals is an excessive\r\nregard to opinion. This is the reason of the want of liberality of which\r\nunbelievers, and unusual believers, have so much reason to complain. But\r\nthe spirit of religion is already bursting through sectarian restraints.\r\nMany powerful voices are raised, within the churches as well as out of\r\nthem, and even from a few pulpits, against the mechanical adoption and\r\npractice of religion, and in favour of individuality of thought, and the\r\nconsequent spontaneousness of speech and action. Many indubitable\r\nChristians are denouncing cant as strongly as those whom cant has\r\nalienated from Christianity. The dislike of associations for religious\r\nobjects is spreading fast; and the eyes of multitudes are being opened\r\nto the fact that there can be little faith at the bottom of that craving\r\nfor sympathy which prevents men and women from cheerfully doing their\r\nduty to God and their neighbour unless sanctioned by a crowd. Some of\r\nthe clergy have done away with the forms of admission to their churches\r\nwhich were formerly considered indispensable. There is a visible\r\nreaction in the best part of society in favour of any man who stands\r\nalone on any point of religious concern: and though such an one has the\r\nmore regularly drilled churches against him, he is usually cheered by\r\nthe grasp of some trusty right hand of fellowship.\r\n\r\nThe eagerness in pursuit of speculative truth is shown by the rapid sale\r\nof every kind of heretical work. The clergy complain of the enormous\r\nspread of bold books, from the infidel tract to the latest handling of\r\nthe miracle question, as sorrowfully as the most liberal members of\r\nsociety lament the unlimited circulation of the false morals issued by\r\ncertain Religious Tract Societies. Both testify to the interest taken by\r\nthe people in religion. The love of truth is also shown by the outbreak\r\nof heresy in all directions. There are schisms among all the more strict\r\nof the religious bodies, and large secessions and new formations among\r\nthose which are bound together by slight forms. There are even a few\r\nplaces to be found where Deists may come among Christians to worship\r\ntheir common Father, without fear of insult to their feelings, and\r\nmockery of their convictions.\r\n\r\nI know also of one place, at least, and I believe there are now several,\r\nwhere the people of colour are welcome to worship with the\r\nwhites,--actually intermingled with them, instead of being set apart in\r\na gallery appropriated to them. This is the last possible test of the\r\nconviction of human equality entertained by the white worshippers. It is\r\nsuch a test of this, their christian conviction, as no persons of any\r\nrank in England are ever called upon to abide. I think it very probable\r\nthat the course of action which is common in America will be followed in\r\nthis instance. A battle for a principle is usually fought long, and\r\nunder discouragement: but the sure fruition is almost instantaneous,\r\nwhen the principle is but once put into action. The people of colour do\r\nactually, in one or more religious assemblies, sit among the whites, in\r\ntoken that the principle of human brotherhood is fully admitted. It may\r\nbe anticipated that the example will spread from church to church--in\r\nthe rural districts of the north first, and then in the towns;[30] so\r\nthat the clergy will soon find themselves released from the necessity of\r\nveiling, or qualifying, the most essential truth of the gospel, from the\r\npastoral consideration for the passions and prejudices of the white\r\nportion of their flocks, which they at present plead in excuse of their\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nThe noble beneficence of the whole community shows that the spirit of\r\nthe gospel is in the midst of them, as it respects the condition of the\r\npoor, ignorant, and afflicted. Of the generosity of society there can be\r\nno question; and if it were only accompanied with the strict justice\r\nwhich the same principles of christian charity require; if there were as\r\nzealous a regard to the rights of intellect and conscience in all as to\r\nthe wants and sufferings of the helpless, such a realisation of high\r\nmorals would be seen as the world has not yet beheld. I have witnessed\r\nsights which persuade me that the principle of charity will yet be\r\ncarried out to its full extent. It gave me pleasure to see the\r\nprovisions made for every class of unfortunates. It gave me more to see\r\nyoung men and women devoting their evening and Sunday leisure to\r\nfostering, in the most benignant manner, the minds of active and\r\ntrustful children. But nothing gave me so much delight as what was said\r\nby a young physician to a young clergyman, on their entering a new\r\nbuilding prepared as a place of worship for children, and also as a kind\r\nof school: as a place where religion might have its free course among\r\nyoung and free minds. \"Now,\" said the young physician, \"here we are,\r\nwith these children dependent upon us. Never let us defile this place\r\nwith the smallest act of spiritual tyranny. Watch me, and I will watch\r\nyou, that we may not lay the weight of a hair upon these little minds.\r\nIf we impose one single opinion upon them, we bring a curse upon our\r\nwork. Here, in this one place, let minds be absolutely free.\" This is\r\nthe true spirit of reverence. He who spoke those words may be\r\nconsidered, I believe and trust, as the organ of no few, who are aware\r\nthat reverence is as requisite to the faithful administration of\r\ncharity, as to the acceptable offering of prayer.\r\n\r\nThe asceticism which pervades large sections of society in America,\r\ntestifies to the existence of a strong interest in religion. Its effects\r\nare most melancholy; but they exhibit only the perversion of that which\r\nis, in itself, a great good.--The asceticism of America is much like\r\nthat of every other place. It brings religion down to be ceremonial,\r\nconstrained, anxious, and altogether divested of its free, generous, and\r\njoyous character. It fosters timid selfishness in some; and in others a\r\nprecise proportion of reckless licentiousness. Its manifestations in\r\nBoston are as remarkable as in the strictest of Scotch towns. Youths in\r\nBoston, who work hard all the week, desire fresh air and exercise, and a\r\nsight of the country, on Sundays. The country must be reached over the\r\nlong bridges before-mentioned, and the youths must ride to obtain their\r\nobject. They have been brought up to think it a sin to take a ride on\r\nSundays. Once having yielded, and being under a sense of transgression\r\nfor a wholly fictitious offence, they rarely stop there.[31] They next\r\njoin parties to smoke, and perhaps to drink, and so on. If they had but\r\nbeen brought up to know that the Sabbath, like all times and seasons,\r\nwas made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; that their religion is in\r\ntheir state of mind, and not in the arrangement of their day, their\r\nSabbaths would most probably have been spent as innocently as any other\r\nday; and the chances would have been much increased of their desiring\r\nthe means of improving their religious knowledge, and cherishing their\r\ndevotional affections, by social worship. I was struck by the fact that\r\nat the Jefferson University, at Charlottesville, Virginia, where no\r\nfundamental provision is made for worship, where not the slightest\r\nauthority is exercised over the students with regard to religious\r\nobservances, there is not only a most regular administration of\r\nreligion, but the fullest attendance upon it. Every one knows what a\r\nburden and snare the public prayers are at our English Universities,\r\nwhere the attendance is compulsory. At Charlottesville, where the matter\r\nis left to the inclination of the students, the attendance is punctual,\r\nquiet, and absolutely universal.[32]\r\n\r\nThe ascetic proscription of amusements extends to the clergy throughout\r\nthe country; and includes the whole of the religious world in New\r\nEngland. As to the clergy, the superstition can scarcely endure long, it\r\nis so destitute of all reason. I went to a large party at Philadelphia,\r\nwith a clergyman and other friends. Dancing presently began. I was asked\r\na question, which implied that my clerical friend had gone home. \"There\r\nhe is,\" I replied. \"O, I concluded that he went away when the dancing\r\nbegan;\" said the lady, in a tone which implied that she thought he ought\r\nto have gone home. It was observed of this gentleman, that he could not\r\nbe a religious man, he was seen at so many parties during my visit to\r\nhis house. No clergyman ever enters the theatre, or touches a card. It\r\nis even expected that he should go away when cards are introduced, as\r\nfrom the ball-room. The exclusion from the theatre is of the least\r\nconsequence, as large portions of society have reasonable doubts about\r\nthe encouragement of an amusement which does seem to be vitiated there,\r\nalmost to the last degree. The Americans have little dramatic taste: and\r\nthe spirit of puritanism still rises up in such fierce opposition to the\r\nstage, as to forbid the hope that this grand means of intellectual\r\nexercise will ever be made the instrument of moral good to society there\r\nthat it might be made: and the proscribed race of dramatic artists is,\r\nin talent and in morals, just what a proscribed and depressed class\r\nmight be expected to be. The attempt to raise their condition and their\r\nart has been strenuously made by the manager of the Boston theatre, who\r\nhas sternly purified his establishment, excluding from his stage\r\neverything that could well give offence even to Boston prudery. But it\r\nis in vain. The uncongeniality is too great: and those who respect\r\ndramatic entertainments the most highly, will be the most anxious that\r\nthe American theatres should be closed. I even know of more families\r\nthan one, unconnected with clergy, and not making any strict religious\r\nprofession, where Shakspeare is hidden, for prudish reasons. I need not\r\nadd, that among such persons there is not the remotest comprehension of\r\nwhat the drama is. If a reader of Shakspeare occurs, here and there, it\r\nusually turns out that he considers the plays as collections of\r\npassages, descriptive, didactic, &c. &c. Such being the state of things,\r\nit is no matter of surprise and regret that the clergy, among others,\r\nabstain from the theatre. But, as to the dancing,--either dancing is\r\ninnocent, or it is not. If not, nobody should dance: if innocent, the\r\nclergy should dance, like others, as they have the same kind of bodies\r\nto be animated, and of minds to be exhilarated. Once admit any\r\ndistinction on account of their office, and there is no stopping short,\r\nin reason, of the celibacy of the clergy, and the other gloomy\r\nsuperstitions by which the free and genial spirit of Christianity has\r\nbeen grieved.\r\n\r\nThis ascetic practice of taking care of one another's morals has gone to\r\nsuch a length in Boston, as to excite the frequent satire of some of its\r\nwisest citizens. This indicates that it will be broken through. When\r\nthere was talk of attempting to set up the Italian opera there, a\r\ngentleman observed that it would never do: people would be afraid of the\r\nvery name. \"O!\" said another, \"call it Lectures on Music, with\r\nillustrations, and everybody will come.\"\r\n\r\nLectures abound in Boston: and I am glad of it; at least in the interval\r\nbefore the opening of the public amusements which will certainly be\r\nrequired, sooner or later. These lectures may not be of any great use in\r\nconveying science and literature: lectures can seldom do more than\r\nactuate to study at home. But in this case, they probably obviate\r\nmeetings for religious excitement, which are more hurtful than lectures\r\nare beneficial. The spiritual dissipations indulged in by the religious\r\nworld, wherever asceticism prevails, are more injurious to sound morals\r\nthan any public amusements, as conducted in modern times, have ever been\r\nproved to be. It is questionable whether even gross licentiousness is\r\nnot at least equally encouraged by the excitement of passionate\r\nreligious emotions, separate from action: and it is certain that rank\r\nspiritual vices, pride, selfishness, tyranny, and superstition, spring\r\nup luxuriantly in the hotbeds of religious meetings. The odiousness of\r\nspiritual vices is apt to be lost sight of in the horror of sensual\r\ntransgressions. If a pure intelligence, however, had to decide between\r\nthe two, he would probably point out that the vices which arise from the\r\nfrailty of nature are less desperate and less revolting than those which\r\nare mainly factitious, and which arise from a perversion of man's\r\nhighest relation. It is difficult to decide which set of vices (if\r\nindeed the line can be drawn between them) spreads the most extensive\r\nmisery, and most completely ruins the unhappy subjects of them; but it\r\nis certain that the sympathies of unsophisticated minds turn more\r\nreadily to the publicans and sinners, than to the pharisees of society:\r\nand they have high authority for so doing.\r\n\r\nStill, the asceticism shows that a strong religious feeling, a strong\r\nsense of religious duty exists, which has only to be enlarged and\r\nenlightened. A most liberal-minded clergyman, a man as democratic in his\r\nreligion, and as genial in his charity, as any layman in the land,\r\nremarked to me one day on the existence of this strong religious\r\nsensibility in the children of the Pilgrims, and asked me what I thought\r\nshould be done to cherish and enlarge it, we having been alarming each\r\nother with the fear that it would be exasperated by the prevalent\r\nsuperstition, and become transmuted, in the next generation, to\r\nsomething very unlike religious sensibility. We proposed great changes\r\nin domestic and social habits: less formal religious observance in\r\nfamilies, and more genial interest in the intellectual provinces of\r\nreligion: more rational promotion of health, by living according to the\r\nlaws of nature, which ordain bodily exercise and mental refreshment. We\r\nproposed that new temptations to walking, driving, boating, &c. should\r\nbe prepared, and the delights of natural scenery laid open much more\r\nfreely than they are: that social amusements of every kind should be\r\nencouraged, and all religious restraints upon speech and action removed:\r\nin short, that spontaneousness should be reverenced and approved above\r\nall things, whatever form it may take. Of course, this can only be done\r\nby those who do approve and reverence spontaneousness: but I am\r\nconfident that there are enough of them, in the very heart of the most\r\nascetic society in America, to make it unreasonable that they should any\r\nlonger succumb to the priests and devotees of the community.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of the breaking out of the true genial spirit of liberty were\r\ncontinually delighting me. A Unitarian clergyman, complaining of the\r\nsuperstition of the body to which he belonged, while they were\r\nperpetually referring to their comparative freedom, observed, \"We are so\r\nbent on standing fast in our liberty, that we don't get on.\" Another\r\nremarked upon an eulogy bestowed on some one as a man and a Christian:\r\n\"as if,\" said the speaker, \"the Christian were the climax! as if it were\r\nnot much more to be a man than a Christian!\"\r\n\r\nThe way in which religion is made an occupation by women, testifies not\r\nonly to the vacuity which must exist when such a mistake is fallen into,\r\nbut to the vigour with which the religious sentiment would probably be\r\ncarried into the great objects and occupations of life, if such were\r\npermitted. I was perpetually struck with this when I saw women braving\r\nhurricane, frost, and snow, to flit from preaching to preaching; and\r\nlaying out the whole day among visits for prayer and religious\r\nexcitement, among the poor and the sick. I was struck with this when I\r\nsaw them labouring at their New Testament, reading superstitiously a\r\ndaily portion of that which was already too familiar to the ear to leave\r\nany genuine and lasting impression, thus read. Extraordinary instances\r\nmet my knowledge of both clergymen and ladies making the grossest\r\nmistakes about conspicuous facts of the gospel history, while reading it\r\nin daily portions for ever. It is not surprising that such a method of\r\nperusal should obviate all real knowledge of the book: but it is\r\nastonishing that those who feel it to be so should not change their\r\nmethods, and begin at length to learn that which they have all their\r\nlives been vainly trusting that they knew.\r\n\r\nThe wife of a member of Congress, a conscientious and religious woman,\r\njudges of persons by one rule,--whether they are \"pious.\" I could never\r\nlearn how she applied this; nor what she comprehended under her phrase.\r\nShe told me that she wished her husband to leave Congress. He was no\r\nlonger a young man, and it was time he was thinking of saving his soul.\r\nShe could not, after long conversation on this subject, realise the idea\r\nthat religion is not an affair of occupation and circumstance, but of\r\nprinciple and temper; and that, as there is no more important duty than\r\nthat of a member of Congress, there is no situation in which a man can\r\nattain a higher religious elevation, if the spirit be in him.\r\n\r\nThe morality and religion of the people of the United States have\r\nsuffered much by their being, especially in New England, an ostensibly\r\nreligious community. There will be less that is ostensible and more that\r\nis genuine, as they grow older. They are finding that it is the\r\npossession of the spirit, and not the profession of the form, which\r\nmakes societies as well as individuals religious. All they have to do is\r\nto assert their birth-right of liberty; to be free and natural. They\r\nneed have no fear of licence and irreligion. The spirit of their\r\nforefathers is strong in them: and, if it were not, the spirit of\r\nHumanity is in them; the very sanctum of religion. The idea of duty\r\n(perverted or unperverted) is before them in all their lives; and the\r\nlove of their neighbour is in all their hearts. As surely then as they\r\nlive and love, they will be religious. What they have to look to is that\r\ntheir religion be free and pure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] When I visited the New York House of Refuge for the reformation of\r\njuvenile delinquents, one of the officers showed me, with complacency,\r\nthat children of colour were sitting among the whites, in both the boys'\r\nand girls' schools. On explaining to me afterwards the arrangements of\r\nthe chapel, he pointed out the division appropriated to the pupils of\r\ncolour. \"Do you let them mix in school, and separate them at worship?\" I\r\nasked. He replied, with no little sharpness, \"_We_ are not\r\namalgamationists, madam.\" The absurdity of the sudden wrath, and of the\r\nfact of a distinction being made at worship (of all occasions) which was\r\nnot made elsewhere, was so palpable, that the whole of our large party\r\nburst into irresistible laughter.\r\n\r\n[31] The author of \"Home\" arranged the Sunday, in her book, somewhat\r\ndifferently from the usual custom; describing the family whose home she\r\npictured as spending the Sunday afternoon on the water, after a\r\nlaborious week, and an attendance on public worship in the morning.\r\nReligious conversation was described as going on throughout the day. So\r\nmuch offence was taken at the idea of a Sunday sail, that the editor of\r\nthe book requested the author to alter the chapter; the first print\r\nbeing proposed to be cancelled. I am sorry to say that she did alter it.\r\nIf she was converted to the popular superstition, (which could scarcely\r\nbe conceived,) no more is to be said. If not, it was a matter of\r\nprinciple which she ought not to have yielded. If books are to be\r\naltered, an author's convictions to be unrepresented, to avoid shocking\r\nreligious prejudices, there is a surrender, not only of the author's\r\nnoblest prerogative, but of his highest duty.\r\n\r\n[32] Ministers of four denominations undertake the duty in rotation, in\r\nterms of a year each. The invitation, and the discharge of the duty, are\r\nas purely voluntary as the attendance upon the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \"What will they then\r\n     But force the spirit of grace itself, and bind\r\n     His consort Liberty? what but unbuild\r\n     His living temples, built by faith to stand,\r\n     Their own faith, not another's?\"\r\n\r\n     _Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Truth shall spring out of the earth;\r\n     And righteousness shall look down from heaven.\"\r\n\r\n     _85th Psalm._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inquiry concerning the working of the voluntary system in\r\nAmerica,--the only country where it operates without an establishment by\r\nits side,--takes two directions. It is asked, first, whether religion is\r\nadministered sufficiently to the people: and, secondly, what is the\r\ncharacter of the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe first question is easily answered. The eagerness for religious\r\ninstruction and the means of social worship are so great that funds and\r\nbuildings are provided wherever society exists. Though the clergy bear a\r\nlarger proportion to men of other occupations, I believe, than is the\r\ncase anywhere, except perhaps in the Peninsula, they are too few for the\r\nreligious wants of the people. Men are wanting; but churches and funds\r\nare sufficient. According to a general summary of religious\r\ndenominations,[33] made in 1835, the number of churches or\r\ncongregations was 15,477; the population being, exclusive of the slaves,\r\nbetween fifteen and sixteen millions; and a not inconsiderable number\r\nbeing settlers scattered in places too remote for the formation of\r\nregular societies, with settled ministers. To these 15,477 churches\r\nthere were only 12,130 ministers. If to these settled clergy, there are\r\nadded the licentiates and candidates of the Presbyterian church, the\r\nlocal preachers of the Methodists, the theological students, and quaker\r\nadministrators, it will be acknowledged that the number of religious\r\nteachers bears an unusually large proportion to the population. Yet the\r\nBaptist sect alone proclaims a want of above three thousand ministers to\r\nsupply the existing churches. Every exertion is made to meet the\r\nreligious wants of the people. The American Education Society has\r\nassisted largely in sending forth young ministers: the Mission and Bible\r\nSocieties exhibit large results. In short, society in the United States\r\noffers every conceivable testimony that the religious instincts of the\r\npeople may be trusted to supply their religious wants. It is only within\r\nfour or five years that this has been fully admitted even in the State\r\nof Massachusetts. Up to 1834, every citizen of that State was obliged to\r\ncontribute something to the support of some sect or church. The\r\ninconsistency of this obligation with true democratic principle was then\r\nfully perceived, and religion left wholly to voluntary support. It is\r\nneedless to say that the event has fully justified the confidence of\r\nthose who have faith enough in Christianity to see that it needs no\r\nprotection from the State, but will commend itself to human hearts\r\nbetter without.\r\n\r\nAs to the other particular of the inquiry,--the character of the\r\nclergy,--more is to be said.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is no room under the voluntary system for some of\r\nthe worst characteristics which have disgraced all christian\r\npriesthoods. In America, there can be no grasping after political power;\r\nno gambling in a lottery of church livings; no worldly pomp and state.\r\nThese sins are precluded under a voluntary system, in the midst of a\r\nrepublic. Instead of these things, we find the protestant clergy\r\ngenerally belonging to the federal party, when they open their lips upon\r\npolitics at all. They belong to the apprehensive party; according to all\r\nprecedent. It would be called strange if it did not almost universally\r\nhappen, that (with the exception of the political churchmen of the Old\r\nWorld) they who uphold a faith which shall remove mountains, who teach\r\nthat men are not to fear \"them that kill the body, and afterwards have\r\nno more that they can do,\" are the most timid class of society; the most\r\nbackward in all great conflicts of principles. They have ever rested\r\ninvisible in their tents, when any wrestling was going on between morals\r\nand abuses. They have ever, as a body, belonged to the aristocratic and\r\nfearing party. So it is in America, where the fearing party is\r\ndepressed; as it has ever been where the aristocratic party is\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\nThe clergy in America are not, as a body, seekers of wealth. It is so\r\ngenerally out of their reach, that the adoption of the clerical\r\nprofession is usually an unequivocal testimony to their\r\ndisinterestedness about money. I say \"usually,\" because there are\r\nexceptions. The profession has been one of such high honour that it\r\nrises to an equality with wealth. It is common, not to say usual, that\r\nyoung clergymen, who are almost invariably from poor families, marry\r\nladies of fortune. Where there are several sisters in a rich family, it\r\nseems to be regarded as a matter of course that one will marry a\r\nclergyman. Amidst some good which arises out of this practice, there is\r\nthe enormous evil, not peculiar to America, that adventurers are tempted\r\ninto the profession. Not a few planters in the south began life as poor\r\nclergymen, and obtained by marriage the means of becoming planters. Not\r\na few pastors in the north grow more sleek than they ever were saintly,\r\nand go through two safe and quiet preachments on Sundays, as the price\r\nof their week-day ease. But, as long as the salaries of ministers are so\r\nmoderate as they now are, it cannot be otherwise than that the greater\r\nnumber of clergy enter upon their profession in full view of a life of\r\nlabour, with small pecuniary recompense. There can, I think, be no\r\nquestion that the vocation is adopted from motives as pure as often\r\nactuate men; and that the dangers to which the clergy succumb arise\r\nafterwards out of their disadvantageous position.\r\n\r\nIt is to be wished that some alteration could be made in the mode of\r\nremunerating the clergy. At present, they have usually small salaries\r\nand large presents. Nothing is more natural than that grateful\r\nindividuals or flocks should like to testify their respect for their\r\npastor by adding to his comforts and luxuries: but, if all the\r\nconsequences were considered, I think the practice would be forborne,\r\nand the salary increased instead. In the present state of morals, it\r\nhappens that instances are rare where one person can give pecuniary\r\nbenefit to another without injury to one or both. Sympathy, help, may be\r\ngiven, with great mutual profit; but rarely money or money's worth.[34]\r\nThis arises from the false associations which have been gathered round\r\nwealth, and have implicated it too extensively with mental and moral\r\nindependence. Any one may answer for himself the question whether it is\r\noften possible to regard a person to whom he is under pecuniary\r\nobligation with precisely the same freedom, from first to last, which\r\nwould otherwise exist. If among people of similar views, objects, and\r\ninterests, this is felt as a difficulty, it is aggravated into a great\r\nmoral danger when spiritual influences are to be dispensed by the aided\r\nand obliged party. I see no safety in anything short of a strict rule on\r\nthe part of an honourable pastor to accept of no gift whatever. This\r\nwould require some self-denial on the part of his friends; but they\r\nought to be aware that giving gifts is the coarsest and lowest method of\r\ntestifying respect and affection. Many ways are open to them: first by\r\ntaking care that their pastor has such a fixed annual provision made for\r\nhim as will secure him from the too heavy pressure of family cares; and\r\nthen by yielding him that honest friendship, and plain-spoken sympathy,\r\n(without any religious peculiarity,) which may animate him in his\r\nstudies and in his ministrations.\r\n\r\nThe American clergy being absolved from the common clerical vices of\r\nambition and cupidity, it remains to be seen whether they are free also\r\nfrom that of the idolatry of opinion. They enter upon their office\r\ngenerally with pious and benevolent views. Do they retain their moral\r\nindependence in it?--I cannot answer favourably.\r\n\r\nThe vices of any class are never to be imputed with the full force of\r\ndisgraces to individuals. The vices of a class must evidently, from\r\ntheir extent, arise from some overpowering influences, under whose\r\noperation individuals should be respectfully compassionated, while the\r\nmorbid influences are condemned. The American clergy are the most\r\nbackward and timid class in the society in which they live; self-exiled\r\nfrom the great moral questions of the time; the least informed with true\r\nknowledge; the least efficient in virtuous action; the least conscious\r\nof that christian and republican freedom which, as the native atmosphere\r\nof piety and holiness, it is their prime duty to cherish and diffuse.\r\nThe proximate causes of their degeneracy in this respect are easily\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that the living of the clergy depends on the opinion of\r\nthose whom they serve. To all but the far and clear-sighted it appears\r\nthat the usefulness of their function does so. Ordinary men may be\r\nexcused for a willingness to seize on the precept about following after\r\nthe things that make for peace, without too close an inquiry into the\r\nnature of that peace. Such a tendency may be excused, but not praised,\r\nin ordinary men. It must be blamed in all pastors who believe that they\r\nhave grasped purer than ordinary principles of gospel freedom.\r\n\r\nThe first great mischief which arises from the disinclination of the\r\nclergy to bring what may be disturbing questions before their people, is\r\nthat they themselves inevitably undergo a perversion of views about the\r\nnature of their pastoral office. To take the most striking instance now\r\npresented in the United States. The clergy have not yet begun to stir\r\nupon the Anti-Slavery question. A very few Presbyterian clergymen have\r\nnobly risked everything for it; some being members of Abolition\r\nsocieties; and some professors in the Oberlin Institute and its\r\nbranches, where all prejudice of colour is discountenanced. But the bulk\r\nof the Presbyterian clergy are as fierce as the slave-holders against\r\nthe abolitionists. I believe they would not object to have Mr.\r\nBreckinridge considered a sample of their body. The episcopalian clergy\r\nare generally silent on the subject of Human Rights, or give their\r\ninfluence against the Abolitionists. Not to go over the whole list of\r\ndenominations, it is sufficient to mention that the ministers generally\r\nare understood to be opposed to abolition, from the circumstances of\r\ntheir silence in the pulpit, their conversation in society, and the\r\nconduct of those who are most under their influence. I pass on to the\r\nUnitarians, the religious body with which I am best acquainted, from my\r\nbeing a Unitarian myself. The Unitarians believe that they are not\r\nliable to many superstitions which cramp the minds and actions of other\r\nreligionists. They profess a religion of greater freedom; and declare\r\nthat Christianity, as they see it, has an affinity with all that is\r\nfree, genial, intrepid, and true in the human mind; and that it is meant\r\nto be carried out into every social arrangement, every speculation of\r\nthought, every act of the life. Clergymen who preach this live in a\r\ncrisis when a tremendous conflict of principles is taking place. On one\r\nside is the oppressor, struggling to keep his power for the sake of his\r\ngold; and with him the mercenary, the faithlessly timid, the ambitious,\r\nand the weak. On the other side are the friends of the slave; and with\r\nthem those who, without possibility of recompense, are sacrificing their\r\nreputations, their fortunes, their quiet, and risking their lives, for\r\nthe principle of freedom. What are the Unitarian clergy doing amidst\r\nthis war which admits of neither peace nor truce, but which must end in\r\nthe subjugation of the principle of freedom, or of oppression?\r\n\r\nI believe Mr. May had the honour of being the first Unitarian pastor who\r\nsided with the right. Whether he has sacrificed to his intrepidity one\r\nchristian grace; whether he has lost one charm of his piety,\r\ngentleness, and charity, amidst the trials of insult which he has had to\r\nundergo, I dare appeal to his worst enemy. Instead of this, his devotion\r\nto a most difficult duty has called forth in him a force of character, a\r\nstrength of reason, of which his best friends were before unaware. It\r\nfilled me with shame for the weakness of men, in their noblest offices,\r\nto hear the insolent compassion with which some of his priestly brethren\r\nspoke of a man whom they have not light and courage enough to follow\r\nthrough the thickets and deserts of duty, and upon whom they therefore\r\nbestow their scornful pity from out of their shady bowers of\r\ncomplacency.--Dr. Follen came next: and there is nothing in his power\r\nthat he has not done and sacrificed in identifying himself with the\r\ncause of emancipation. I heard him, in a perilous time, pray in church\r\nfor the \"miserable, degraded, insulted slave; in chains of iron, and\r\nchains of gold.\" This is not the place in which to exhibit what his\r\nsacrifices have really been.--Dr. Channing's later services are well\r\nknown. I know of two more of the Unitarian clergy who have made an open\r\nand dangerous avowal of the right: and of one or two who have in private\r\nresisted wrong in the cause. But this is all. As a body they must,\r\nthough disapproving slavery, be ranked as the enemies of the\r\nabolitionists. Some have pleaded to me that it is a distasteful subject.\r\nSome think it sufficient that they can see faults in individual\r\nabolitionists. Some say that their pulpits are the property of their\r\npeople, who are not therefore to have their minds disturbed by what they\r\nhear thence. Some say that the question is no business of theirs. Some\r\nurge that they should be turned out of their pulpits before the next\r\nSunday, if they touched upon Human Rights. Some think the subject not\r\nspiritual enough. The greater number excuse themselves on the ground of\r\na doctrine which, I cannot but think, has grown out of the\r\ncircumstances; that the duty of the clergy is to decide on how much\r\ntruth the people can bear, and to administer it accordingly.--So, while\r\nsociety is going through the greatest of moral revolutions, casting out\r\nits most vicious anomaly, and bringing its Christianity into its\r\npolitics and its social conduct, the clergy, even the Unitarian clergy,\r\nare some pitying and some ridiculing the apostles of the revolution;\r\npreaching spiritualism, learning, speculation; advocating third and\r\nfourth-rate objects of human exertion and amelioration, and leaving it\r\nto the laity to carry out the first and pressing moral reform of the\r\nage. They are blind to their noble mission of enlightening and guiding\r\nthe moral sentiment of society in its greatest crisis. They not only\r\ndecline aiding the cause in weekdays by deed or pen, or spoken words;\r\nbut they agree in private to avoid the subject of Human Rights in the\r\npulpit till the crisis be past. No one asks them to harrow the feelings\r\nof their hearers by sermons on slavery: but they avoid offering those\r\nchristian principles of faith and liberty with which slavery cannot\r\nco-exist.\r\n\r\nSeeing what I have seen, I can come to no other conclusion than that the\r\nmost guilty class of the community in regard to the slavery question at\r\npresent is, not the slave-holding, nor even the mercantile, but the\r\nclerical: the most guilty, because not only are they not blinded by\r\nlife-long custom and prejudice, nor by pecuniary interest, but they\r\nprofess to spend their lives in the study of moral relations, and have\r\npledged themselves to declare the whole counsel of God.--Whenever the\r\nday comes for the right principle to be established, let them not dare\r\nto glory in the glory of their country. Now, in its martyr-age, they\r\nshrink from being confessors. It will not be for them to march in to\r\nthe triumph with the \"glorious army.\" Yet, if the clergy of America\r\nfollow the example of other rear-guards of society, they will be the\r\nfirst to glory in the reformation which they have done their utmost to\r\nretard.\r\n\r\nThe fearful and disgraceful mistake about the true nature of the\r\nclerical office,--the supposition that it consists in adapting the truth\r\nto the minds of the hearers,--is already producing its effect in\r\nthinning the churches, and impelling the people to find an\r\nadministration of religion better suited to their need. The want of\r\nfaith in other men and in principles, and the superabundant faith in\r\nthemselves, shown in this notion of pastoral duty, (which has been\r\nactually preached, as well as pleaded in private,) are so conspicuous,\r\nas to need no further exposure. The history of priesthoods may be\r\nreferred to as an exhibition of its consequences. I was struck at first\r\nwith an advocacy of Ordinances among some of the Unitarian clergy, which\r\nI was confident must go beyond their own belief. I was told that a great\r\npoint was made of them, (not as observances but as ordinances,) because\r\nthe public mind required them. I saw a minister using vehement and\r\nunaccustomed action, (of course wholly inappropriate,) in a pulpit not\r\nhis own; and was told that that set of people required plenty of action\r\nto be assured the preacher was in earnest. I was told that when\r\nprejudices and interests have gathered round any point of morals, truth\r\nceases to be truth, and it becomes a minister's duty to avoid the topic\r\naltogether. The consequences may be anticipated.--\"What do you think,\r\nsir, the people will do, as they discover the backwardness of their\r\nclergy?\" I heard a minister of one sect say to a minister of\r\nanother.--\"I think, sir, they will soon require a better clergy,\" was\r\nthe reply. The people are requiring a better clergy. Even in Boston, so\r\nfar behind the country as that city is, a notable change has already\r\ntaken place. A strong man, full of enlarged sympathies, has not only\r\ndiscerned the wants of the time, but set himself to do what one man may\r\nto supply them. He invites to worship those who think and feel with him,\r\nas to what their communion with the Father must be, to sustain their\r\nprinciples and their cheer in this trying time. A multitude flocks round\r\nhim; the earnest spirits of the city and the day, whose full hearts and\r\nworn spirits can find little ease and refreshment amidst the abstract\r\nand inappropriate services of ministers who give them truth as they\r\njudge they can receive it. Nothing but the whole truth will satisfy\r\nthose who are living and dying for it. The rising up of this new church\r\nin Boston is an eloquent sign of the times.[35]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary revelation of the state of the case between the clergy\r\nand the people was made to me, most unconsciously, by a minister who, by\r\nthe way, acknowledges that he avoids, on principle, preaching on the\r\nsubjects which interest him most: he thinks he serves his people best,\r\nby carrying into the pulpit subjects of secondary interest to himself.\r\nThis gentleman, shocked with the tidings of some social tyranny on the\r\nanti-slavery question, exclaimed, \"Such a revelation of the state of\r\npeople's minds as this, is enough to make one leave one's pulpit, and\r\nset to work to mend society.\" What a volume do these few words disclose,\r\nas to the relation of the clergy to the people and the time!\r\n\r\nWhat the effect would be of the clergy carrying religion into what is\r\nmost practically important, and therefore most interesting, is shown as\r\noften as opportunity occurs; which is all too seldom. When Dr. Channing\r\ndropped, in a sermon last winter, that legislatures as well as\r\nindividuals were bound to do the will of God, every head in the church\r\nwas raised or turned; every eye waited upon him. When another minister\r\npreached on being 'alone,' and showed how the noblest benefactors of the\r\nrace, the truest servants of God, must, in striking out into new regions\r\nof thought and action, pass beyond the circle of common human\r\nsympathies, and suffer accordingly, many a stout heart melted into\r\ntears; many a rigid face crimsoned with emotion; and the sermon was\r\nrepeated and referred to, far and near, under the name of \"the Garrison\r\nsermon;\" a name given to it, not by the preacher, but by the consciences\r\nof some and the sympathies of others. Contrast with such an effect as\r\nthis the influence of preaching, irrelevant to minds and seasons. If\r\nsuch sayings are admired or admitted at the moment, they are soon\r\nforgotten, or remembered only in the general. \"Don't you think,\" said a\r\ngentleman to me, \"that sermons are sadly useless things for the most\r\npart? admonitions strung like bird's eggs on a string; so that they tell\r\npretty much the same, backwards or forwards, one way or another.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the one thing in which the clergy of every kind\r\nare fatally deficient is faith: that faith which would lead them, first,\r\nto appropriate all truth, fearlessly and unconditionally; and then to\r\ngive it as freely as they have received it. They are fond of apostolic\r\nauthority. What would Paul's ministry have been if he had preached on\r\neverything but idolatry at Ephesus, and licentiousness at Corinth? There\r\nwere people whose silver shrines, whose prejudices, whose false moral\r\nprinciples were in danger. There were people who were as unconscious of\r\nthe depth of their sin as the oppressors of the negro at the present\r\nday. How would Paul have then finished his course? If he had stopped\r\nshort from the expediency of not dividing a household against itself, in\r\ncase such should be the consequence of giving true principles to the\r\nair; if, dreading to break up the false peace of successful lucre and\r\noverbearing profligacy, he had confined himself to speculations like\r\nthose with which he won the ear of the Athenians, carefully avoiding all\r\nallusions to Diana at Ephesus, and to temperance and judgment to come at\r\nCorinth, what kind of an apostle would he have been? Very like the\r\nAmerican christian clergy of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe next great mischief that arises from the fear of opinion which makes\r\nthe clergy keep aloof from the stirring questions of the time, is that\r\nthey are deprived of that influence, (the highest kind of all,) that men\r\nexert by their individual characters and convictions. Their character is\r\ncomparatively uninfluential from its being supposed professional; and\r\ntheir convictions, because they are concluded to be formed from\r\nimperfect materials. A clergyman's opinions on politics, and on other\r\naffairs of active life in which morals are most implicated, are attended\r\nto precisely in proportion as he is secular in his habits and pursuits.\r\nA minister preached, a few years ago, against discount, and high prices\r\nin times of scarcity. The merchants of his flock went away laughing: and\r\nthe pastor has never got over it. The merchants speak of him as a very\r\nholy man, and esteem his services highly for keeping their wives,\r\nchildren, and domestics in strict religious order: but in preaching to\r\nthemselves he has been preaching to the winds ever since that day. A\r\nliberal-minded, religious father of a family said to me, \"Take care how\r\nyou receive the uncorroborated statements of clergymen about that;\" (a\r\nmatter of social fact;) \"they know nothing about it. They are not likely\r\nto know anything about it.\" \"Why?\" \"Because there is nobody to tell\r\nthem. You know the clergy are looked upon by all grown men as a sort of\r\npeople between men and women.\" In a republic, where politics afford the\r\ndiscipline and means of expression of every man's morals, the clergy\r\nwithdraw from, not only all party movements, but all political\r\ninterests. Some barely vote: others do not even do this. Their plea is,\r\nas usual, that public opinion will not bear that the clergy should be\r\nupon the same footing as to worldly affairs as others. If this be true,\r\npublic opinion should not be allowed to dictate their private duty to\r\nthe moral teachers of society. A clergyman should discharge the duties\r\nof a citizen all the more faithfully for the need which the public thus\r\nshow themselves to be in of his example. But, if it be true, whence\r\narises the objection of the public to the clergy discharging the\r\nresponsibilities of citizens, but from the popular belief that they are\r\nunfitted for it? If the democracy see that the clergy are almost all\r\nfederalists, and the federalist merchants and lawyers consider the\r\nclergy so little fit for common affairs as to call them a set of people\r\nbetween men and women, it is easy to see whence arises the dislike to\r\ntheir taking part in politics; if indeed the dislike really exists. The\r\nstatement should not, however, be taken on the word of the clergy alone;\r\nfor they are very apt to think that the people cannot yet bear many\r\nthings in which the flocks have already outstripped their pastors.\r\n\r\nA third great mischief from the isolation of the clergy is that, while\r\nit deprives them of the highest kind of influence which is the\r\nprerogative of manhood, it gives them a lower kind:--an influence as\r\nstrong as it is pernicious to others, and dangerous to themselves;--an\r\ninfluence confined to the weak members of society; women and\r\nsuperstitious men. By such they are called \"faithful guardians.\"\r\nGuardians of what? A healthy person may guard a sick one: a sane man may\r\nguard a lunatic: a grown person may guard a child: and, for social\r\npurposes, an appointed watch may guard a criminal. But how can any man\r\nguard his equal in spiritual matters, the most absolutely individual of\r\nall? How can any man come between another's soul and the infinite to\r\nwhich it tends? If it is said that they are guardians of truth, and not\r\nof conscience, they may be asked for their warrant. God has given his\r\ntruth for all. Each is to lay hold of what he can receive of it; and he\r\nsins if he devolves upon another the guardianship of what is given him\r\nfor himself. As to the fitness of the clergy to be guardians, it is\r\nenough to mention what I know: that there is infidelity within the walls\r\nof their churches of which they do not dream; and profligacy among their\r\nflocks of which they will be the last to hear. Even in matters which are\r\nesteemed their peculiar business, the state of faith and morals, they\r\nare more in the dark than any other persons in society. Some of the most\r\nreligious and moral persons in the community are among those who never\r\nenter their churches; while among the company who sit at the feet of the\r\npastor while he refines upon abstractions, and builds a moral structure\r\nupon imperfect principles, or upon metaphysical impossibilities, there\r\nare some in whom the very capacity of stedfast belief has been cruelly\r\ndestroyed; some who hide loose morals under a strict profession of\r\nreligion; and some if possible more lost still, who have arrived at\r\nmaking their religion co-exist with their profligacy. Is there not here\r\nsomething like the blind leading the blind?\r\n\r\nOver those who consider the clergy \"faithful guardians,\" their\r\ninfluence, as far as it is professional, is bad; as far as it is that of\r\nfriendship or acquaintanceship, it is according to the characters of the\r\nmen. I am disposed to think ill of the effects of the practice of\r\nparochial visiting, except in cases of poor and afflicted persons, who\r\nhave little other resource of human sympathy. I cannot enlarge upon the\r\ndisagreeable subject of the devotion of the ladies to the clergy. I\r\nbelieve there is no liberal-minded minister who does not see, and too\r\nsensibly feel, the evil of women being driven back upon religion as a\r\nresource against vacuity; and of there being a professional class to\r\nadminister it. Some of the most sensible and religious elderly women I\r\nknow in America speak, with a strength which evinces strong conviction,\r\nof the mischief to their sex of ministers entering the profession young\r\nand poor, and with a great enthusiasm for parochial visiting. There is\r\nno very wide difference between the auricular confession of the catholic\r\nchurch, and the spiritual confidence reposed in ministers the most\r\ndevoted to visiting their flocks. Enough may be seen in the religious\r\nperiodicals of America about the help women give to young ministers by\r\nthe needle, by raising subscriptions, and by more toilsome labours than\r\nthey should be allowed to undergo in such a cause. If young men cannot\r\nearn with their own hands the means of finishing their education, and\r\nproviding themselves with food and clothing, without the help of women,\r\nthey may safely conclude that their vocation is to get their bread\r\nfirst; whether or not it may be to preach afterwards.[36] But this kind\r\nof dependence is wholly unnecessary. There is more provision made for\r\nthe clergy than there are clergy to use it.\r\n\r\nA young clergyman came home, one day, and complained to me that some of\r\nhis parochial visiting afflicted him much. He had been visiting and\r\nexhorting a mother who had lost her infant; a sorrow which he always\r\nfound he could not reach. The mourner had sat still, and heard all he\r\nhad to say: but his impression was that he had not met any of her\r\nfeelings; that he had done nothing but harm. How should it be otherwise?\r\nWhat should he know of the grief of a mother for her infant? He was sent\r\nfor, as a kind of charmer, to charm away the heart's pain. Such pain is\r\nnot sent to be charmed away. It could be made more endurable only by\r\nsympathy, of all outward aids: and sympathy, of necessity, he had none;\r\nbut only a timid pain with which to aggravate hers. It was natural that\r\nhe should do nothing but harm.\r\n\r\nMy final impression is, that religion is best administered in America by\r\nthe personal character of the most virtuous members of society, out of\r\nthe theological profession: and next, by the acts and preachings of the\r\nmembers of that profession who are the most secular in their habits of\r\nmind and life. The exclusively clerical are the worst enemies of\r\nChristianity, except the vicious.\r\n\r\nThe fault is not in the Voluntary System; for the case is equally bad on\r\nboth sides the Atlantic: and an Establishment like the English does\r\nlittle more than superadd the danger of a careless, ambitious, worldly\r\nclergy,[37] in the richer priests of the church, and an overworked and\r\nill-recompensed set of working clergy. The evil lies in a superstition\r\nwhich no establishment can ever obviate; in the superstition, to use the\r\nwords of an American clergyman, \"of believing that religion is something\r\nelse than goodness.\" From this it arises that an ecclesiastical\r\nprofession still exists; not for the study of theological science,\r\n(which is quite reasonable,) but for the dispensing of goodness. From\r\nthis it arises that ecclesiastical goodness is practically separated\r\nfrom active personal and social goodness. From this it arises that the\r\nyeomanry of America, those who are ever in the presence of God's high\r\npriest, Nature, and out of the worldly competitions of a society\r\nsophisticated with superstition, are perpetually in advance of the rest\r\nof the community on the great moral questions of the time, while the\r\nclergy are in the rear.\r\n\r\nWhat must be done? The machinery of administration must be changed. The\r\npeople have been brought up to suppose that they saw Christianity in\r\ntheir ministers. The first consequence of this mistake was, that\r\nChristianity was extensively misunderstood; as it still is. The trying\r\nmoral conflicts of the time are acting as a test. The people are rapidly\r\ndiscovering that the supposed faithful mirror is a grossly refracting\r\nmedium; and the blessed consequence will be, that they will look at the\r\nobject for themselves, declining any medium at all. The clerical\r\nprofession is too hard and too perilous a one, too little justifiable on\r\nthe ground of principle, too much opposed to the spirit of the gospel,\r\nto outlive long the individual research into religion, to which the\r\nfaults of the clergy are daily impelling the people.\r\n\r\nTo what then must we meantime trust for religion?--To the administration\r\nof God, and the heart of man. Has not God his own ways, unlike our ways,\r\nof teaching when man misteaches? It is worth travelling in the wild\r\nwest, away from churches and priests, to see how religion springs up in\r\nthe pleasant woods, and is nourished by the winds and the star-light.\r\nThe child on the grass is not alone in listening for God's tramp on the\r\nfloor of his creation. We are all children, ever so listening. Impulses\r\nof religion arise wherever there is life and society; whenever hope is\r\nrebuked, and fear relieved; wherever there is love to be cherished, and\r\nage and childhood to be guarded. If it be true, as my friend and I\r\nspeculated, that religious sensibility is best awakened by the spectacle\r\nof the beauty of holiness, religion is everywhere safe; for this beauty\r\nis as prevalent, more or less perceptibly, as the light of human eyes.\r\nIt is safe as long as the gospel history is extant. The beauty of\r\nholiness is there so resplendent, that, to those who look upon it with\r\ntheir own eyes, it seems inconceivable that, if it were once brought\r\nunveiled before the minds of men, every one would not adopt it into his\r\nreason and his affections from that hour. It has been reorganising and\r\nvivifying society from the day of its advent. It is carrying on this\r\nvery work now in the New World. The institutions of America are, as I\r\nhave said, planted down deep into Christianity. Its spirit must make an\r\neffectual pilgrimage through a society, of which it may be called a\r\nnative; and no mistrust of its influences can for ever intercept that\r\nspirit in its mission of denouncing anomalies, exposing hypocrisy,\r\nrebuking faithlessness, raising and communing with the outcast, and\r\ndriving out sordidness from the circuit of this, the most glorious\r\ntemple of society that has ever yet been reared. The community will be\r\nchristian as sure as democracy is christian.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] This summary does not pretend to be complete, but it is the nearest\r\napproximation to fact that can be obtained. According to it the\r\nEpiscopalian Methodists are the most numerous sect: then the Catholics,\r\nCalvinistic Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Christians,\r\nEpiscopalians, and Quakers. The other denominations follow, down to the\r\nTunkers and Shakers, which are the smallest.\r\n\r\n[34]\r\n\r\n\"It is a mortifying truth, that two men in any rank of society could\r\nhardly be found virtuous enough to give money, and to take it, as a\r\nnecessary gift, without injury to the moral entireness of one or both.\r\nBut so stands the fact.\"\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, xlviii. p. 303.\r\n\r\n[35] See Appendix E, for a part of a discourse by Orestes A. Brownson on\r\nthe Wants of the Times. It is given as it fell from his lips, and not as\r\na specimen of his practice of composition. The reader, however, will\r\nprobably be no more disposed to remember anything about style in the\r\npresence of this discourse, than Mr. Brownson's hearers are wont to be.\r\n\r\n[36] See Appendix F.\r\n\r\n[37] It is amusing to see how our aristocratic and ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions strike simple republicans. I was asked whether the English\r\nBishops were not a necessary intermediate aristocracy between the Lords\r\nand the Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy book must come to an end; but I offer no conclusion of my subject. I\r\ndo not pretend to have formed any theory about American society or\r\nprospects to which a finishing hand can be put in the last page.\r\nAmerican society itself constitutes but the first pages of a great book\r\nof events, into whose progress we can see but a little way; and that but\r\ndimly. It is too soon yet to theorise; much too soon to speak of\r\nconclusions even as to the present entire state of this great nation.\r\n\r\nMeantime, some prominent facts appear to stand out from their history\r\nand condition, which it may be useful to recognise, while refusing to\r\npronounce upon their positive or comparative virtue and happiness.\r\n\r\nBy a happy coincidence of outward plenty with liberal institutions,\r\nthere is in America a smaller amount of crime, poverty, and mutual\r\ninjury of every kind, than has ever been known in any society. This is\r\nnot only a present blessing, but the best preparation for continued\r\nfidelity to true democratic principles.\r\n\r\nHowever the Americans may fall short, in practice, of the professed\r\nprinciples of their association, they have realised many things for\r\nwhich the rest of the civilised world is still struggling; and which\r\nsome portions are only beginning to intend. They are, to all intents and\r\npurposes, self-governed. They have risen above all liability to a\r\nhereditary aristocracy, a connexion between religion and the State, a\r\nvicious or excessive taxation, and the irresponsibility of any class.\r\nWhatever evils may remain or may arise, in either the legislative or\r\nexecutive departments, the means of remedy are in the hands of the whole\r\npeople: and those people are in possession of the glorious certainty\r\nthat time and exertion will infallibly secure all wisely desired\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThey have one tremendous anomaly to cast out; a deadly sin against their\r\nown principles to abjure. But they are doing this with an earnestness\r\nwhich proves that the national heart is sound. The progress of the\r\nAbolition question within three years, throughout the whole of the rural\r\ndistricts of the north, is a far stronger testimony to the virtue of the\r\nnation than the noisy clamour of a portion of the slave-holders of the\r\nsouth, and the merchant aristocracy of the north, with the silence of\r\nthe clergy, are against it. The nation must not be judged of by that\r\nportion whose worldly interests are involved in the maintenance of the\r\nanomaly; nor yet by the eight hundred flourishing abolition societies of\r\nthe north, with all the supporters they have in unassociated\r\nindividuals. The nation must be judged of as to Slavery by neither of\r\nthese parties; but by the aspect of the conflict between them. If it be\r\nfound that the five abolitionists who first met in a little chamber five\r\nyears ago, to measure their moral strength against this national\r\nenormity, have become a host beneath whose assaults the vicious\r\ninstitution is rocking to its foundations, it is time that slavery was\r\nceasing to be a national reproach. Europe now owes to America the\r\njustice of regarding her as the country of abolitionism, quite as\r\nemphatically as the country of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation and the morals of the Americans fall far below their\r\nown principles. This is enough to say. It is better than contrasting or\r\ncomparing them with European morals and civilisation: which contrast or\r\ncomparison can answer no purpose, unless on the supposition, which I do\r\nnot think a just one, that their morals and civilisation are derived\r\nfrom their political organisation. A host of other influences are at\r\nwork, which must nullify all conclusions drawn from the politics of the\r\nAmericans to their morals. Such conclusions will be somewhat less rash\r\ntwo centuries hence. Meantime, it will be the business of the world, as\r\nwell as of America, to watch the course of republicanism and of national\r\nmorals; to mark their mutual action, and humbly learn whatever the new\r\nexperiment may give out. To the whole world, as well as to the\r\nAmericans, it is important to ascertain whether the extraordinary mutual\r\nrespect and kindness of the American people generally are attributable\r\nto their republicanism: and again, how far their republicanism is\r\nanswerable for their greatest fault,--their deficiency of moral\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nNo peculiarity in them is more remarkable than their national\r\ncontentment. If this were the result of apathy, it would be despicable:\r\nif it did not coexist with an active principle of progress, it would be\r\nabsurd. As it is, I can regard this national attribute with no other\r\nfeeling than veneration. Entertaining, as I do, little doubt of the\r\ngeneral safety of the American Union, and none of the moral progress of\r\nits people, it is clear to me that this national contentment will live\r\ndown all contempt, and even all wonder; and come at length to be\r\nregarded with the same genial and universal emotion with which men\r\nrecognise in an individual the equanimity of rational self-reverence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSince pp. 47-52, in the first volume, were printed, intelligence has\r\narrived of the admission of Michigan into the Union: on what terms, I\r\nhave not been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS'S SPEECH ON TEXAS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI suppose a more portentous case, certainly within the bounds of\r\npossibility--I would to God I could say not within the bounds of\r\nprobability. You have been, if you are not now, at the very point of a\r\nwar with Mexico--a war, I am sorry to say, so far as public rumour may\r\nbe credited, stimulated by provocations on our part from the very\r\ncommencement of this administration down to the recent authority given\r\nto General Gaines to invade the Mexican territory. It is said that one\r\nof the earliest acts of this administration was a proposal, made at a\r\ntime when there was already much ill-humour in Mexico against the United\r\nStates, that she should cede to the United States a very large portion\r\nof her territory--large enough to constitute nine States equal in extent\r\nto Kentucky. It must be confessed that a device better calculated to\r\nproduce jealousy, suspicion, ill-will, and hatred, could not have been\r\ncontrived. It is further affirmed that this overture, offensive in\r\nitself, was made precisely at the time when a swarm of colonists from\r\nthese United States were covering the Mexican border with land-jobbing,\r\nand with slaves, introduced in defiance of the Mexican laws, by which\r\nslavery had been abolished throughout that Republic. The war now raging\r\nin Texas is a Mexican civil war, and a war for the re-establishment of\r\nslavery where it was abolished.--It is not a servile war, but a war\r\nbetween slavery and emancipation, and every possible effort has been\r\nmade to drive us into the war, on the side of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a circumstance eminently fortunate for us that this\r\nmonster, Santa Ana, has been defeated and taken, though I cannot\r\nparticipate in that exquisite joy with which we have been told that\r\nevery one having Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins must have been delighted\r\non hearing that this ruffian has been shot, in cold blood, when a\r\nprisoner of war, by the Anglo-Saxon leader of the victorious Texan army.\r\nSir, I hope there is no member of this house, of other than Anglo-Saxon\r\norigin, who will deem it uncourteous that I, being myself in part\r\nAnglo-Saxon, must, of course, hold that for the best blood that ever\r\ncirculated in human veins. Oh! yes, sir! far be it from me to depreciate\r\nthe glories of the Anglo-Saxon race; although there have been times when\r\nthey bowed their necks and submitted to the law of conquest, beneath the\r\nascendency of the Norman race. But, sir, it has struck me as no\r\ninconsiderable evidence of the spirit which is spurring us into this war\r\nof aggression, of conquest, and of slave-making, that all the fires of\r\nancient, hereditary national hatred are to be kindled, to familiarise us\r\nwith the ferocious spirit of rejoicing at the massacre of prisoners in\r\ncold blood. Sir, is there not yet hatred enough between the races which\r\ncompose your Southern population and the population of Mexico, their\r\nnext neighbour, but you must go back eight hundred or a thousand years,\r\nand to another hemisphere, for the fountains of bitterness between you\r\nand them? What is the temper of feeling between the component parts of\r\nour own Southern population, between your Anglo-Saxon, Norman, French,\r\nand Moorish Spanish inhabitants of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and\r\nMissouri? between them all and the Indian savage, the original possessor\r\nof the land from which you are scourging him already back to the foot\r\nof the Rocky Mountains? What between them all and the native American\r\nnegro, of African origin, whom they are holding in cruel bondage? Are\r\nthese elements of harmony, concord, and patriotism between the component\r\nparts of a nation starting upon a crusade of conquest? And what are the\r\nfeelings of all this motley compound of your Southern population towards\r\nthe compound equally heterogeneous of the Mexican population? Do not\r\nyou, an Anglo-Saxon, slave-holding exterminator of Indians, from the\r\nbottom of your soul, hate the Mexican-Spaniard-Indian, emancipator of\r\nslaves and abolisher of slavery? And do you think that your hatred is\r\nnot with equal cordiality returned? Go to the city of Mexico, ask any of\r\nyour fellow-citizens who have been there for the last three or four\r\nyears, whether they scarcely dare show their faces, as Anglo-Americans,\r\nin the streets. Be assured, sir, that, however heartily you detest the\r\nMexican, his bosom burns with an equally deep-seated detestation of you.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the nation with which, at the instigation of your Executive\r\nGovernment, you are now rushing into war--into a war of conquest;\r\ncommenced by aggression on your part, and for the re-establishment of\r\nslavery, where it has been abolished, throughout the Mexican Republic.\r\nFor your war will be with Mexico--with a Republic of twenty-four States,\r\nand a population of eight or nine millions of souls. It seems to be\r\nconsidered that this victory over twelve hundred men, with the capture\r\nof their commander, the President of the Mexican Republic, has already\r\nachieved the conquest of the whole Republic. That it may have achieved\r\nthe independence of Texas, is not impossible. But Texas is to the\r\nMexican Republic not more nor so much as the State of Michigan is to\r\nyours. That State of Michigan, the people of which are in vain claiming\r\nof you the performance of that sacred promise you made them, of\r\nadmitting her as a State into the Union; that State of Michigan, which\r\nhas greater grievances and heavier wrongs to allege against you for a\r\ndeclaration of her independence, if she were disposed to declare it,\r\nthan the people of Texas have for breaking off their union with the\r\nRepublic of Mexico. Texas is an extreme boundary portion of the Republic\r\nof Mexico; a wilderness inhabited only by Indians, till after the\r\nRevolution which separated Mexico from Spain; not sufficiently populous\r\nat the organisation of the Mexican Confederacy to form a State by\r\nitself, and therefore united with Coahuila, where the greatest part of\r\nthe indigenous part of the population reside. Sir, the history of all\r\nthe emancipated Spanish American colonies has been, ever since their\r\nseparation from Spain, a history of convulsionary wars; of revolutions,\r\naccomplished by single, and often very insignificant battles; of\r\nchieftains, whose title to power has been the murder of their immediate\r\npredecessors. They have all partaken of the character of the first\r\nconquest of Mexico by Cortez, and of Peru by Pizarro; and this, sir,\r\nmakes me shudder at the thought of connecting our destinies indissolubly\r\nwith theirs. It may be that a new revolution in Mexico will follow upon\r\nthis captivity or death of their president and commanding general; we\r\nhave rumours, indeed, that such a revolution had happened even before\r\nhis defeat; but I cannot yet see my way clear to the conclusion that\r\neither the independence of Texas, or the capture and military execution\r\nof Santa Ana, will save you from war with Mexico. Santa Ana was but one\r\nof a breed of which Spanish America for the last twenty-five years has\r\nbeen a teeming mother--soldiers of fortune, who, by the sword or the\r\nmusket-ball, have risen to supreme power, and by the sword or the\r\nmusket-ball have fallen from it. That breed is not extinct; the very\r\nlast intelligence from Peru tells of one who has fallen there as\r\nYturbide, and Mina, and Guerrero, and Santa Ana have fallen in Mexico.\r\nThe same soil which produced them is yet fertile to produce others. They\r\nreproduce themselves, with nothing but a change of the name and of the\r\nman. Your war, sir, is to be a war of races--the Anglo-Saxon American\r\npitted against the Moorish-Spanish-Mexican American; a war between the\r\nNorthern and Southern halves of North America; from Passamaquoddy to\r\nPanama. Are you prepared for such a war?\r\n\r\nAnd again I ask, what will be your _cause_ in such a war? Aggression,\r\nconquest, and the re-establishment of slavery where it has been\r\nabolished. In that war, sir, the banners of _freedom_ will be the\r\nbanners of Mexico; and your banners, I blush to speak the word, will be\r\nthe banners of slavery.\r\n\r\nSir, in considering these United States and the United Mexican States as\r\nmere masses of power coming into collision against each other, I cannot\r\ndoubt that Mexico will be the greatest sufferer by the shock. The\r\nconquest of all Mexico would seem to be no improbable result of the\r\nconflict, especially if the war should extend no farther than to the two\r\nmighty combatants. But will it be so confined? Mexico is clearly the\r\nweakest of the two powers; but she is not the least prepared for action.\r\nShe has the more recent experience of war. She has the greatest number\r\nof veteran warriors; and although her highest chief has just suffered a\r\nfatal and ignominious defeat, yet that has happened often before to\r\nleaders of armies, too confident of success, and contemptuous of their\r\nenemy. Even now, Mexico is better prepared for a war of invasion upon\r\nyou, than you are for a war of invasion upon her. There may be found a\r\nsuccessor to Santa Ana, inflamed with the desire, not only of avenging\r\nhis disaster, but what he and his nation will consider your perfidious\r\nhostility. The national spirit may go with him. He may not only turn the\r\ntables upon the Texan conquerors, but drive them for refuge within your\r\nborders, and pursue them into the heart of your own territories. Are you\r\nin a condition to resist him? Is the success of your whole army, and all\r\nyour veteran generals, and all your militia-calls, and all your mutinous\r\nvolunteers, against a miserable band of five or six hundred invisible\r\nSeminole Indians, in your late campaign, an earnest of the energy and\r\nvigour with which you are ready to carry on that far otherwise\r\nformidable and complicated war?--Complicated did I say? And how\r\ncomplicated? Your Seminole war is already spreading to the Creeks; and,\r\nin their march of desolation, they sweep along with them your negro\r\nslaves, and put arms into their hands to make common cause with them\r\nagainst you; and how far will it spread, sir, should a Mexican invader,\r\nwith the torch of liberty in his hand, and the standard of freedom\r\nfloating over his head, proclaiming emancipation to the slave, and\r\nrevenge to the native Indian, as he goes, invade your soil? What will be\r\nthe condition of your States of Louisiana, of Mississippi, of Alabama,\r\nof Arkansas, of Missouri, and of Georgia? Where will be your negroes?\r\nWhere will be that combined and concentrated mass of Indian tribes,\r\nwhom, by an inconceivable policy, you have expelled from their\r\nwidely-distant habitations, to embody them within a small compass on the\r\nvery borders of Mexico, as if on purpose to give to that country a\r\nnation of natural allies in their hostilities against you? Sir, you have\r\na Mexican, an Indian, and a negro war upon your hands, and you are\r\nplunging yourself into it blindfold; you are talking about acknowledging\r\nthe independence of the Republic of Texas, and you are thirsting to\r\nannex Texas, ay, and Coahuila, and Tamaulipas, and Santa Fe, from the\r\nsource to the mouth of the Rio Bravo, to your already over-distended\r\ndominions. Five hundred thousand square miles of the territory of Mexico\r\nwould not even now quench your burning thirst for aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nBut will your foreign war for this be with Mexico alone? No, sir. As the\r\nweaker party, Mexico, when the contest shall have once begun, will look\r\nabroad, as well as among your negroes and your Indians, for assistance.\r\nNeither Great Britain nor France will suffer you to make such a conquest\r\nfrom Mexico; no, nor even to annex the independent State of Texas to\r\nyour Confederation, without their interposition. You will have an\r\nAnglo-Saxon intertwined with a Mexican war to wage. Great Britain may\r\nhave no serious objection to the independence of Texas, and may be\r\nwilling enough to take her under her protection, as a barrier both\r\nagainst Mexico and against you. But, as an aggrandisement to you, she\r\nwill not readily suffer it; and, above all, she will not suffer you to\r\nacquire it by conquest, and the re-establishment of slavery. Urged on by\r\nthe irresistible, overwhelming torrent of public opinion, Great Britain\r\nhas recently, at a cost of one hundred million of dollars, which her\r\npeople have joyfully paid, abolished slavery, throughout all her\r\ncolonies in the West Indies. After setting such an example, she will\r\nnot--it is impossible that she should--stand by and witness a war for\r\nthe re-establishment of slavery, where it had been for years abolished,\r\nand situated thus in the immediate neighbourhood of her islands. She\r\nwill tell you, that if you must have Texas as a member of your\r\nConfederacy, it must be without the taint or the trammels of slavery;\r\nand if you will wage a war to handcuff and fetter your fellow-man, she\r\nwill wage the war against you to break his chains. Sir, what a figure,\r\nin the eyes of mankind, would you make, in deadly conflict with Great\r\nBritain: she fighting the battles of emancipation, and you the battles\r\nof slavery; she the benefactress, and you the oppressor, of human kind!\r\nIn such a war, the enthusiasm of emancipation, too, would unite vast\r\nnumbers of her people in aid of the national rivalry, and all her\r\nnatural jealousy against our aggrandisement. No war was ever so popular\r\nin England as that war would be against slavery, the slave-trade, and\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon descendant from her own loins.\r\n\r\nAs to the annexation of Texas to your Confederation, for what do you\r\nwant it? Are you not large and unwieldy enough already? Do not two\r\nmillions of square miles cover surface enough for the insatiate rapacity\r\nof your land-jobbers? I hope there are none of them within the sound of\r\nmy voice. Have you not Indians enough to expel from the land of their\r\nfathers' sepulchres, and to exterminate? What, in a prudential and\r\nmilitary point of view, would be the addition of Texas to your domain?\r\nIt would be weakness, and not power. Is your southern and south-western\r\nfrontier not sufficiently extensive? not sufficiently feeble? not\r\nsufficiently defenceless? Why are you adding regiment after regiment of\r\ndragoons to your standing army? Why are you struggling, by direction and\r\nby indirection, to raise _per saltum_ that army from less than six to\r\nmore than twenty thousand men? Your commanding general, now returning\r\nfrom his excursion to Florida, openly recommends the increase of your\r\narmy to that number. Sir, the extension of your sea-coast frontier from\r\nthe Sabine to the Rio Bravo, would add to your weakness tenfold; for it\r\nis now only weakness with reference to Mexico. It would then be weakness\r\nwith reference to Great Britain, to France, even perhaps to Russia, to\r\nevery naval European power, which might make a quarrel with us for the\r\nsake of settling a colony; but, above all, to Great Britain. She, by her\r\nnaval power, and by her American colonies, holds the keys of the Gulf of\r\nMexico. What would be the condition of your frontier from the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi to that of the Rio del Norte, in the event of a war with\r\nGreat Britain? Sir, the reasons of Mr. Monroe for accepting the Sabine\r\nas the boundary were three. First, he had no confidence in the strength\r\nof our claim as far as the Rio Bravo; secondly, he thought it would make\r\nour union so heavy, that it would break into fragments by its own\r\nweight; thirdly, he thought it would protrude a long line of sea-coast,\r\nwhich, in our first war with Great Britain, she might take into her own\r\npossession, and which we should be able neither to defend nor to\r\nrecover. At that time there was no question of slavery or of abolition\r\nin the controversy. The country belonged to Spain; it was a wilderness,\r\nand slavery was the established law of the land. There was then no\r\nproject for carving out nine slave States, to hold eighteen seats in the\r\nother wing of this capitol, in the triangle between the mouths and the\r\nsources of the Mississippi and Bravo rivers. But what was our claim? Why\r\nit was that La Salle, having discovered the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\nand France having made a settlement at New Orleans, France had a right\r\nto one half the sea-coast from the mouth of the Mississippi to the next\r\nSpanish settlement, which was Vera Cruz. The mouth of the Rio Bravo was\r\nabout half way from the Balize to Vera Cruz; and so as grantees, from\r\nFrance of Louisiana, we claimed to the Rio del Norte, though the Spanish\r\nsettlement of Santa Fe was at the head of that river. France, from whom\r\nwe had received Louisiana, utterly disclaimed ever having even raised\r\nsuch a pretension. Still we made the best of the claim that we could,\r\nand finally yielded it for the Floridas, and for the line of the 42d\r\ndegree of latitude from the source of the Arkansas river to the South\r\nSea. Such was our claim; and you may judge how much confidence Mr.\r\nMonroe could have in its validity. The great object and desire of the\r\ncountry then was to obtain the Floridas. It was General Jackson's\r\ndesire; and in that conference with me to which I have heretofore\r\nalluded, and which it is said he does not recollect, he said to me that\r\nso long as the Florida rivers were not in our possession, there could be\r\nno safety for our whole Southern country.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, suppose you should annex Texas to these United States; another\r\nyear would not pass before you would have to engage in a war for the\r\nconquest of the Island of Cuba. What is now the condition of that\r\nisland? Still under the nominal protection of Spain. And what is the\r\ncondition of Spain herself? Consuming her own vitals in a civil war for\r\nthe succession to the crown. Do you expect, that whatever may be the\r\nissue of that war, she can retain even the nominal possession of Cuba?\r\nAfter having lost _all_ her continental colonies in North and South\r\nAmerica, Cuba will stand in need of more efficient protection; and above\r\nall, the protection of a naval power. Suppose that naval power should be\r\nGreat Britain. There is Cuba at your very door; and if you spread\r\nyourself along a naked coast, from the Sabine to the Rio Bravo, what\r\nwill be your relative position towards Great Britain, with not only\r\nJamaica, but Cuba, and Porto Rico in her hands, and abolition for the\r\nmotto to her union cross of St. George and St. Andrew? Mr. Chairman, do\r\nyou think I am treading on fantastic grounds? Let me tell you a piece of\r\nhistory, not far remote. Sir, many years have not passed away since an\r\ninternal revolution in Spain subjected that country and her king for a\r\nshort time to the momentary government of the Cortes. That revolution\r\nwas followed by another, by which, under the auspices of a French army\r\nwith the Duke d'Angouleme at their head, Ferdinand the Seventh was\r\nrestored to a despotic throne; Cuba had followed the fortunes of the\r\nCortes when they were crowned with victory; and when the\r\ncounter-revolution came, the inhabitants of the island, uncertain what\r\nwas to be their destination, were for some time in great perplexity what\r\nto do for themselves. Two considerable parties arose in the island, one\r\nof which was for placing it under the protection of Great Britain, and\r\nanother was for annexing it to the confederation of these United States.\r\nBy one of these parties I have reason to believe that overtures were\r\nmade to the Government of Great Britain. By the other _I know_ that\r\novertures were made to the government of the United States. And I\r\nfurther know that secret, though irresponsible assurances were\r\ncommunicated to the then President of the United States, as coming from\r\nthe French Government, that _they_ were secretly informed that the\r\nBritish Government had determined to take possession of Cuba. Whether\r\nsimilar overtures were made to France herself, I do not undertake to\r\nsay; but that Mr. George Canning, then the British Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, was under no inconsiderable alarm, lest, under the\r\npupilage of the Duke d'Angouleme, Ferdinand the Seventh might commit to\r\nthe commander of a French naval squadron the custody of the Moro Castle,\r\nis a circumstance also well known to me. It happened that just about\r\nthat time a French squadron of considerable force was fitted out and\r\nreceived sailing orders for the West Indies, without formal\r\ncommunication of the fact to the British Government; and that as soon as\r\nit was made known to him, he gave orders to the British Ambassador at\r\nParis to demand, in the most peremptory tone, what was the destination\r\nof that squadron, and a special and positive disclaimer that it was\r\nintended even to visit the Havana; and this was made the occasion of\r\nmutual explanations, by which Great Britain, France, and the United\r\nStates, not by the formal solemnity of a treaty, but by the implied\r\nengagement of mutual assurances of intention, gave pledges of honour to\r\neach other, that neither of them should in the then condition of the\r\nisland take it, or the Moro Castle, as its citadel, from the possession\r\nof Spain. This engagement was on all sides faithfully performed; but,\r\nwithout it, who doubts that from that day to this either of the three\r\npowers might have taken the island and held it in undisputed possession?\r\n\r\nAt this time circumstances have changed--popular revolutions both in\r\nFrance and Great Britain have perhaps curbed the spirit of conquest in\r\nGreat Britain, and France may have enough to do to govern her kingdom of\r\nAlgiers. But Spain is again convulsed with a civil war for the\r\nsuccession to her crown; she has irretrievably lost all her colonies on\r\nboth continents of America. It is impossible that she should hold much\r\nlonger a shadow of dominion over the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico; nor\r\ncan those islands, in their present condition, form independent nations,\r\ncapable of protecting themselves. They must for ages remain at the mercy\r\nof Great Britain or of these United States, or of both; Great Britain is\r\neven now about to interfere in this war for the Spanish succession. If\r\nby the utter imbecility of the Mexican confederacy this revolt of Texas\r\nshould lead immediately to its separation from that Republic, and its\r\nannexation to the United States, I believe it impossible that Great\r\nBritain should look on while this operation is performing with\r\nindifference. She will see that it must shake her own whole colonial\r\npower on this continent, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean\r\nSeas, like an earthquake; she will see, too, that it endangers her own\r\nabolition of slavery in her own colonies. A war for the restoration of\r\nslavery where it has been abolished, if successful in Texas, must extend\r\nover all Mexico; and the example will threaten her with imminent danger\r\nof a war of colours in her own islands. She will take possession of Cuba\r\nand of Porto Rico, by cession from Spain or by the batteries from her\r\nwooden walls; and if you ask her by what authority she has done it, she\r\nwill ask you, in return, by what authority you have extended your\r\nsea-coast from the Sabine to the Rio Bravo. She will ask you a question\r\nmore perplexing, namely--by what authority you, with freedom,\r\nindependence, and democracy upon your lips, are waging a war of\r\nextermination to forge new manacles and fetters, instead of those which\r\nare falling from the hands and feet of man. She will carry emancipation\r\nand abolition with her in every fold of her flag; while your stars, as\r\nthey increase in numbers, will be overcast with the murky vapours of\r\noppression, and the only portion of your banners visible to the eye will\r\nbe the blood-stained stripes of the taskmaster.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, are you ready for all these wars? A Mexican war? a war\r\nwith Great Britain, if not with France? a general Indian war? a servile\r\nwar? and, as an inevitable consequence of them all, a civil war? For it\r\nmust ultimately terminate in a war of colours as well as of races. And\r\ndo you imagine that while with your eyes open you are wilfully kindling,\r\nand then closing your eyes and blindly rushing into them; do you imagine\r\nthat while, in the very nature of things, your own Southern and\r\nSouthwestern States must be the Flanders of these complicated wars, the\r\nbattle-field upon which the last great conflict must be fought between\r\nslavery and emancipation; do you imagine that your Congress will have no\r\nconstitutional authority to interfere with the institution of slavery\r\n_in any way_ in the States of this Confederacy? Sir, they must and will\r\ninterfere with it--perhaps to sustain it by war; perhaps to abolish it\r\nby treaties of peace; and they will not only possess the constitutional\r\npower so to interfere, but they will be bound in duty to do it by the\r\nexpress provisions of the Constitution itself. For the instant that your\r\nslaveholding States become the theatre of war, civil, servile, or\r\nforeign, from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to\r\ninterference with the institution of slavery in every way by which it\r\ncan be interfered with, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or\r\ndestroyed, to the cession of the State burdened with slavery to a\r\nforeign power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nGENERAL AND STATE FINANCES.\r\n\r\n_Statement of Moneys received into the Treasury from all sources, for\r\nthe year 1832._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           Dollars.

VI.\r\n\r\n     \"_Mrs. Page._--Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in\r\n     the world at his book. I pray you ask him some questions in his\r\n     accidence.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Evans._--Come hither, William, hold up your head, come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of our Connecticut teacher, Mr. Bates, papa resolved\r\nto carry on our education himself. We were to rise by daylight, that he\r\nmight pursue his accustomed ride over the fields after breakfast. New\r\nwriting-books were taken out and ruled, fresh quills laid by their side,\r\nour task carefully committed to memory, and we sat with a mixture of\r\ndocility and curiosity, to know how he would manage as a teacher. The\r\nfirst three days our lessons being on trodden ground, and ourselves\r\nunder the impulse of novelty, we were very amiable, he very paternal; on\r\nthe fourth, John was turned out of the room, Richard was pronounced a\r\nmule, and I went sobbing to mamma as if my heart would break, while papa\r\nsaid he might be compelled to ditch rice fields, but he never would\r\nundertake to teach children again.\r\n\r\nA slight constraint was thrown over the family for a day or two, but it\r\nsoon wore off, and he returned to his good-nature. For three weeks we\r\nwere as wild as fawns, until mamma's attention was attracted by my\r\nsun-burnt complexion, and my brothers' torn clothes.\r\n\r\n\"This will never answer,\" said she to papa. \"Look at Cornelia's face!\r\nIt is as brown as a chinquapin. Richard has ruined his new suit, and\r\nJohn has cut his leg with the carpenter's tools. I have half a mind to\r\nkeep school for them myself.\"\r\n\r\nPapa gave a slight whistle, which seemed rather to stimulate than check\r\nher resolution.\r\n\r\n\"Cornelia,\" said she, \"go directly to your brothers, and prepare your\r\nbooks for to-morrow. _I_ will teach you.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture about to be presented is not overwrought. I am confident of\r\nthe sympathy of many a mother, whose finger has been kept on a word in\r\nthe dictionary so long a time, that her pupils, forgetting her vocation,\r\nhave lounged through the first interruptions and finished with a frolic.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that the retirement of a plantation was the most\r\nappropriate spot for a mother and her children to give and receive\r\ninstruction. Not so, for instead of a limited household, her dependants\r\nare increased to a number which would constitute a village. She is\r\nobliged to listen to cases of grievance, is a nurse to the sick,\r\ndistributes the half-yearly clothing; indeed, the mere giving out of\r\nthread and needles is something of a charge on so large a scale. A\r\nplanter's lady may seem indolent, because there are so many under her\r\nwho perform trivial services, but the very circumstance of keeping so\r\nmany menials in order is an arduous one, and the _keys_ of her\r\nestablishment are a care of which a northern housekeeper knows nothing,\r\nand include a very extensive class of duties. Many fair and even\r\naristocratic girls, if we may use this phrase in our republican country,\r\nwho grace a ball-room, or loll in a liveried carriage, may be seen with\r\nthese steel talismans, presiding over store-houses, and measuring with\r\nthe accuracy and conscientiousness of a shopman, the daily allowance of\r\nthe family; or cutting homespun suits, for days together, for the young\r\nand old slaves under their charge; while matrons, who would ring a bell\r\nfor their pocket-handkerchief to be brought to them, will act the part\r\nof a surgeon or physician, with a promptitude and skill, which would\r\nexcite astonishment in a stranger. Very frequently, slaves, like\r\nchildren, will only take medicine from their superiors, and in this case\r\nthe planter's wife or daughter is admirably fitted to aid them.\r\n\r\nThere are few establishments where all care and responsibility devolves\r\non the master, and even then the superintendence of a large domestic\r\ncircle, and the rites of hospitality, demand so large a portion of the\r\nmistress's time, as leaves her but little opportunity for systematic\r\nteaching in her family. In this case she is wise to seek an efficient\r\ntutor, still appropriating those opportunities which perpetually arise\r\nunder the same roof, to improve their moral and religious culture, and\r\ncultivate those sympathies which exalt these precious beings from\r\nchildren to friends.\r\n\r\nThe young, conscientious, ardent mother must be taught this by\r\nexperience. She has a jealousy at first of any instruction that shall\r\ncome between their dawning minds and her own, and is only taught by the\r\nconstantly thwarted recitation, that in this country, at least, good\r\nhousekeeping and good teaching cannot be combined.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my narrative. The morning after mamma's order, we\r\nassembled at ten o'clock. There was a little trepidation in her manner,\r\nbut we loved her too well to annoy her by noticing it. Her education had\r\nbeen confined to mere rudiments, and her good sense led her only to\r\nconduct our reading, writing, and spelling.\r\n\r\nWe stood in a line.\r\n\r\n\"Spell _irrigate_,\" said she. Just then the coachman entered, and\r\nbowing, said, \"Maussa send me for de key for get four quart o'corn for\r\nhim bay horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe key was given.\r\n\r\n\"Spell _imitate_,\" said mamma.\r\n\r\n\"We did not spell _irrigate_,\" we all exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said she, \"_irrigate_.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the two words were well through, Chloe, the most refined of\r\nour coloured circle, appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Will mistress please to _medjure_ out some calomel for Syphax, who is\r\nfeverish and onrestless?\"[38]\r\n\r\nDuring mamma's visit to the doctor's shop, as the medicine-closet was\r\ncalled, we turned the inkstand over on her mahogany table, and wiped it\r\nup with our pocket-handkerchiefs. It required some time to cleanse and\r\narrange ourselves; and just as we were seated and had advanced a little\r\nway on our orthographical journey, maum Phillis entered with her usual\r\ndrawl, \"Little maussa want for nurse, marm.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this operation was going on, we gathered round mamma to play\r\nbo-peep with the baby, until even she forgot our lessons. At length the\r\nlittle pet was dismissed with the white drops still resting on his red\r\nlips, and our line was formed again.\r\n\r\nMamma's next interruption, after successfully issuing a few words, was\r\nto settle a quarrel between La Fayette and Venus, two little blackies,\r\nwho were going through their daily drill, in learning to rub the\r\nfurniture, which with brushing flies at meals constitutes the first\r\ninstruction for house servants. These important and classical personages\r\nrubbed about a stroke to the minute on each side of the cellaret,\r\nrolling up their eyes and making grimaces at each other. At this crisis\r\nthey had laid claim to the same rubbing-cloth; mamma stopped the dispute\r\nby ordering my seamstress Flora, who was sewing for me, to apply the\r\nweight of her thimble, that long-known weapon of offence, as well as\r\nimplement of industry, to their organ of firmness.\r\n\r\n\"Spell _accentuate_\" said mamma, whose finger had slipped from the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that is not the place,\" we exclaimed, rectifying the mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Spell _irritate_\" said she, with admirable coolness, and John fairly\r\nsucceeded just as the overseer's son, a sallow little boy with yellow\r\nhair, and blue homespun dress, came in with his hat on, and kicking up\r\none foot for manners, said, \"Fayther says as how he wants master\r\nRichard's horse to help tote some tetters[39] to t'other field.\"\r\n\r\nThis pretty piece of alliteration was complied with, after some\r\nremonstrance from brother Dick, and we finished our column. At this\r\ncrisis, before we were fairly seated at writing, mamma was summoned to\r\nthe hall to one of the field hands, who had received an injury in the\r\nancle from a hoe. Papa and the overseer being at a distance, she was\r\nobliged to superintend the wound. We all followed her, La Fayette and\r\nVenus bringing up the rear. She inspected the sufferer's great foot,\r\ncovered with blood and perspiration, superintended a bath, prepared a\r\nhealing application, and bound it on with her own delicate hands, first\r\nquietly tying a black apron over her white dress. Here was no shrinking,\r\nno hiding of the eyes, and while extracting some extraneous substance\r\nfrom the wound, her manner was as resolute as it was gentle and\r\nconsoling. This episode gave Richard an opportunity to unload his\r\npockets of groundnuts, and treat us therewith. We were again seated at\r\nour writing-books, and were going on swimmingly with \"_Avoid evil\r\ncompany_,\" when a little crow-minder, hoarse from his late occupation,\r\ncame in with a basket of eggs, and said,\r\n\r\n\"Mammy Phillis send Missis some egg for buy, ma'am; she ain't so bery\r\nwell, and ax for some 'baccer.\"\r\n\r\nIt took a little time to pay for the eggs and send to the store-room for\r\nthe Virginia-weed, of which opportunity we availed ourselves to draw\r\nfigures on our slates: mamma reproved us, and we were resuming our\r\nduties, when the cook's son approached and said,\r\n\r\n\"Missis, Daddy Ajax say he been broke de axe, and ax me for ax you for\r\nlen him de new axe.\"\r\n\r\nThis made us shout out with laughter, and the business was scarcely\r\nsettled, when the dinner-horn sounded. That evening a carriage full of\r\nfriends arrived from the city to pass a week with us, and thus ended\r\nmamma's experiment in teaching.\r\n\r\nOur summers were usually passed at Springland, a pine-settlement, where\r\nabout twenty families resorted at that season of the year. We were\r\nfortunate to find a French lady already engaged in teaching, from whom I\r\ntook lessons on the piano-forte and guitar. The summer passed swiftly\r\naway. Papa was delighted with my facility in French, in which my\r\nbrothers were also engaged, and we were happy to retain Madame d'Anville\r\nin our own family, on our return to Roseland.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of November a stranger was announced to papa, and a young\r\nman of very prepossessing appearance entered with a letter. It proved to\r\nbe from our teacher, Mr. Bates. The contents were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_Respected Sir._--I now sit down to write to you, to inform you that I\r\nam well, as also are Sir and Mar'm, my sister Nancy, and all the rest of\r\nour folks except aunt Patty, who is but poorly, having attacks of the\r\nrheumatiz, and shortness of breath. I should add, that Mrs. Prudence\r\nBates, (who after the regular publishment on the church-doors for three\r\nSundays, was united to me in the holy bands of wedlock, by our minister\r\nMr. Ezekiel Duncan,) is in a good state of health, at this present,\r\nthough her uncle, by her father's side, has been sick of jaundice, a\r\ncomplaint that has been off and on with him for a considerable spell.\r\n\r\n\"The bearer of this epistle is Parson Duncan's son, by name Mr. Charles\r\nDuncan, a very likely young man, but poorly in health, and Dr. Hincks\r\nsays, going down to Charleston may set him up. I have the candour to\r\nsay, that I think him, on some accounts, a more proper teacher than your\r\nhumble servant, having served his time at a regular college edication.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have writ a much longer letter than I thought on, but somehow it\r\nmakes me chirpy to think of Roseland, though the young folks were\r\nobstreperous.\r\n\r\n\"Give my love nevertheless to them, and Miss Wilton, and all the little\r\nones, as also I would not forget Daddy Jacque, whom I consider,\r\nnotwithstanding his colour, as a very respectable person. I cannot say\r\nas much for Jim, who was an eternal thorn in my side, by reason of his\r\nquickness at mischief, and his slowness at waiting upon me; and I take\r\nthis opportunity of testifying, that I believe if he had been in New\r\nEngland, he would have had his deserts before this; but you Southern\r\nfolks do put up with an unaccountable sight from niggers, and I hope\r\nJim will not be allowed his full tether, if so be Mr. Charles should\r\ntake my situation in your family. I often tell our folks how I used to\r\ncatch up a thing and do it rather than wait for half-a-dozen on 'em to\r\ntake their own time. If I lived to the age of Methusalem, I never could\r\ngit that composed, quiet kind of way you Southern folks have of waiting\r\non the niggers. I only wish they could see aunt Patty move when the\r\nrheumatiz is off--if she isn't spry, I don't know.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse all errors,\r\n\"Yours to serve,\r\n\"JOSEPH BATES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI detected a gentle, half-comical smile on Mr. Duncan's mouth as he\r\nraised his splendid eyes to papa, while delivering Mr. Bates' letter;\r\nbut he soon walked to the window, and asked me some questions about the\r\nCherokee-rose hedge, and other objects in view, which were novelties to\r\nhim. I felt instantly that he was a gentleman, by the atmosphere of\r\nrefinement which was thrown over him, and I saw that papa sympathised\r\nwith me, as with graceful courtesy he welcomed him to\r\nRoseland.--_Southern Rose-bud._\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\nThe following is such information as I have been able to obtain\r\nrespecting the public Educational provision in the United States, from\r\nthe year 1830 to 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Free States in 1830._\r\n\r\nMAINE.--\"By a law of the State, every town, however large or small, is\r\nrequired to raise annually, for the support of schools, a sum equal at\r\nleast to _forty cents._ for each person in the town, and to distribute\r\nthis sum among the several schools or districts, in proportion to the\r\nnumber of scholars in each. The expenditure of the sum is left\r\nprincipally to the direction of the town, and its committee or agents,\r\nappointed for that purpose. In the year 1825, the legislature required a\r\nreport from each town in the State, respecting the situation of the\r\nschools.\"--_United States Almanack._\r\n\r\nAt that time, the number of school districts in ten counties was, 2,499.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of children between 4 and 21 was     137,931\r\nThe number who usually attend schools           101,325\r\n\r\n                                                   Dollars.\r\nAmount required by law to be expended annually      119,334\r\nAmount raised from taxes                            132,263\r\nAmount from the income of permanent funds             5,614\r\nTotal annual expenditure                            137,878\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of incorporated academies in the State was 31; 4 of which\r\nwere for girls: the amount of funds varying from 2,000 to 22,000 dollars\r\na-year.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE.--\"From the year 1808 to 1818, there were raised in New\r\nHampshire 70,000 dollars annually by law, for the support of common\r\nschools. This amount was raised by a separate tax, levied throughout the\r\nState, in the ratio of taxation for the State Tax. Since 1818, the\r\nyearly amount of the sum raised has been 90,000 dollars. This is the\r\namount required by law, but a few towns raise more than they are\r\nrequired. The legislature assumes no control over the immediate\r\nappropriation, but leaves this to each town.\"\r\n\r\nThe State had also, in 1830, an annual income of 9,000 dollars, and a\r\nliterary fund of 64,000 dollars, raised by a tax of a half per cent. on\r\nthe capital of the banks; both to be, from that time, annually divided\r\namong the towns, in the ratio of taxation.\r\n\r\nSome of the towns had separate school funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white population of New Hampshire at this time was    268,721\r\nThe coloured population                                       607\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMONT.--An act was passed in 1827 to provide for the support of\r\ncommon schools. About 100,000 dollars was raised in 1830. A fund was\r\nalso accumulating, which was to be applied whenever its income would\r\nsupport a common free-school in every district of the State, for two\r\nmonths in the year.\r\n\r\nThere were about 20 incorporated academies in the State, where young men\r\nwere fitted for college. The number of students was supposed to average\r\n40 at each.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.--\"By the returns from 131 towns, presented to the\r\nlegislature, it appears that the amount annually paid in these towns for\r\npublic schools, is 177,206 dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The number of scholars receiving instruction                   70,599\r\nThe number of pupils attending private schools in those towns   12,393\r\n\r\nAt an expense of       170,342 dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The number of persons in those towns, between the ages of 14 and 21,\r\nunable to read and write, is 58.\r\n\r\n\"In the town of Hancock, in Berkshire county, there are only 3 persons\r\nbetween 14 and 21 who cannot read and write; and they are\r\n_mutes_.\"--_American Annual Register._\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND.--\"In January, 1828, the legislature appropriated 10,000\r\ndollars annually for the support of public schools, to be divided among\r\nthe several towns, in proportion to the population, with authority for\r\neach town to raise, by annual tax, double the amount received from the\r\nTreasury, as its proportion of the 10,000 dollars.\r\n\r\n\"There has been as yet no report of the number of school establishments\r\nunder the act, but it is thought that they may safely be put down at 60,\r\nas all the towns have availed themselves of its provisions.

They are unlike any which\r\nhave preceded us. They are new, and consequently demand what I have\r\ncalled a new Dispensation of Christianity, a dispensation in perfect\r\nharmony with the new order of things which has sprung into existence.\r\nYet of this fact we seem not to have been generally aware. The character\r\nof our religious institutions, the style of our preaching, the means we\r\nrely upon for the production of the christian virtues, are such as were\r\nadopted in a distant age, and fitted to wants which no longer exist, or\r\nwhich exist only in a greatly modified shape.\r\n\r\nIt is to this fact that I attribute that _other_ fact, of which I have\r\nheretofore spoken, that our churches are far from being filled, and that\r\na large and an increasing portion of our community take very little\r\ninterest in religious institutions, and manifest a most perfect\r\nindifference to religious instruction. These persons do not stay away\r\nfrom our churches because they have no wish to be religious, no desire\r\nto meet and commune in the solemn Temple with their fellow men, and with\r\nthe Great and Good Spirit which reigns everywhere around and within\r\nthem. It is not because they do not value this communion, that they do\r\nnot come into our churches, but because they do not find it in our\r\nchurches. They cannot find, under the costume of our institutions, and\r\nour instructions, the Father-God, to love and adore, with whom to hold\r\nsweet and invigorating communings; they are unable to find that sympathy\r\nof man with man which they crave--to obtain that response to the warm\r\naffections of the heart, which would make them love to assemble together\r\nand bow together before one common altar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut were this difficulty obviated, were seats easily obtained by all,\r\nand so obtained as to imply on the part of no one an assumption of\r\nsuperiority, or a confession of inferiority, the preaching which is most\r\ncommon is far from being satisfactory, and the wants of the times would\r\nby no means be met. I say the preaching which is most common is far from\r\nbeing satisfactory; but not because it is not true. I accuse no preacher\r\nof not preaching the truth. The truth is, I believe, preached in all\r\nchurches, of all denominations, to a certain extent at least; but not\r\nthe right kind of truth, or not truth under the aspects demanded by the\r\nwants of the age and country. All truth is valuable, but all truths are\r\nnot equally valuable; and all aspects of the same truths are not at all\r\ntimes, in all places, equally attractive. The fault I find with\r\npreaching in general is, that it is not on the right kind of topics to\r\ninterest the masses in this age and country. The topics usually\r\ndiscussed may once have been of the highest importance; they may now be\r\nvery interesting to the scholar, or to the student in his closet, or\r\nwith his fellow-students; but they are, to a great extent, matters of\r\nperfect indifference to the many. The many care nothing about the\r\nmeaning of a Greek particle, or the settling of a various reading;\r\nnothing about the meaning of dogmas long since deprived of life, about\r\nthe manners and customs of a people of whom they may have heard, but in\r\nwhose destiny they feel no peculiar interest; they are not fed by\r\ndescriptions of a Jewish marriage-feast, a reiteration of Jewish\r\nthreatenings, nor with beautiful essays, and rounded periods, on some\r\npetty duty, or some insignificant point in theology. They want strong\r\nlanguage, stirring discourses on great principles, which go deep into\r\nthe universal mind, and strike a chord which vibrates through the\r\nuniversal heart. They want to be directed to the deep things of God and\r\nhumanity, and enlightened and warmed on matters with which they every\r\nday come in contact, and which will be to them matters of kindling\r\nthought and strong feeling through eternity.\r\n\r\nThat our religious institutions, or our modes of dispensing christian\r\ntruth, are not in harmony with the wants of the times, is evinced by the\r\nincrease of infidelity, and the success infidels have in their exertions\r\nto collect societies and organise opposition to Christianity. There is\r\nsustained in this city a society of infidels: free inquirers, I believe\r\nthey call themselves. Why has this society been collected? Not, I will\r\nventure to say, because their leader is an infidel. People do not go to\r\nhear him because he advocates atheistical or pantheistical doctrines;\r\nnot because he denies Christianity, rejects the bible, and indulges in\r\nvarious witticisms at the expense of members of the clerical profession;\r\nbut because he opposes the aristocracy of our churches, and vindicates\r\nthe rights of the mind. He succeeds, not because he is an infidel, but\r\nbecause he has hitherto shown himself a democrat.\r\n\r\nMen are never infidels for the sake of infidelity. Infidelity--I use not\r\nthe term reproachfully--has no charms of its own. There is no charm in\r\nlooking around on our fellow men as mere plants that spring up in the\r\nmorning, wither and die ere it is night. It is not pleasant to look up\r\ninto the heavens, brilliant with their sapphire gems, and see no spirit\r\nshining there--over the rich and flowering earth, and see no spirit\r\nblooming there--abroad upon a world of mute, dead matter, and feel\r\nourselves--alone. It is not pleasant to look upon the heavens as\r\ndispeopled of the Gods, and the earth of men, to feel ourselves in the\r\ncentre of a universal blank, with no soul to love, no spirit with which\r\nto commune. I know well what is that sense of loneliness which comes\r\nover the unbeliever, the desolateness of soul under which he is\r\noppressed: but I will not attempt to describe it.\r\n\r\nI say, then, it is not infidelity that gives the leader of the infidel\r\nparty success. It is his defence of free inquiry and of democracy. In\r\nvindicating his own right to disbelieve Christianity, he has vindicated\r\nthe rights of the mind, proved that all have a right to inquire fully\r\ninto all subjects, and to abide by the honest convictions of their own\r\nunderstandings. In doing this he has met the wants of a large portion of\r\nthe community, and met them as no church has ever yet been able to meet\r\nthem. I say not that he himself is a free inquirer, but he proclaims\r\nfree inquiry as one of the rights of man; and in doing this, he has\r\nproclaimed what thousands feel, though they may not generally dare own\r\nit. The want to inquire, to ascertain what is truth, what and wherefore\r\nwe believe, is becoming more and more urgent; we may disown, unchurch,\r\nanathematise it, but suppress it we cannot. It is too late to stay the\r\nprogress of free inquiry. The dams and dykes we construct to keep back\r\nits swelling tide are but mere resting-places, from which it may break\r\nforth in renovated power, and with redoubled fury. It is sweeping on;\r\nand, I say, let it sweep on, let it sweep on; the truth has nothing to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nNext to the want to inquire, to philosophise, the age is distinguished\r\nby its tendency to democracy, and its craving for social reform. Be\r\npleased or displeased as we may, the age is unquestionably tending to\r\ndemocracy; the democratic spirit is triumphing. The millions awake. The\r\nmasses appear, and every day is more and more disclosed\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The might that slumbers in a peasant's arm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voice of the awakened millions rising into new and undreamed-of\r\nimportance, crying out for popular institutions, comes to us on every\r\nbreeze, and mingles in every sound. All over the christian world a\r\ncontest is going on, not as in former times between monarchs and nobles,\r\nbut between the people and their masters, between the many and the few,\r\nthe privileged and the unprivileged--and victory, though here and there\r\nseeming at first view doubtful, everywhere inclines to the party of the\r\nmany. Old distinctions are losing their value; titles are becoming less\r\nand less able to confer dignity; simple tastes, simple habits, simple\r\nmanners are becoming fashionable; the simple dignity of man is more and\r\nmore coveted, and with the discerning it has already become more\r\nhonourable to call one simply a MAN than a gentleman.\r\n\r\nNow it is to this democratic spirit that the leader of the infidel party\r\nappeals, and in which he finds a powerful element of his success.\r\nCorrespondents of his paper attempt even to identify atheism and\r\ndemocracy. I myself once firmly believed that there could be no social\r\nprogress, that man could not rise to his true dignity without the\r\ndestruction of religion; I really believed that religious institutions,\r\ntastes, and beliefs were the greatest, almost the sole, barrier to human\r\nimprovement: and what I once honestly believed, is now as honestly\r\nbelieved by thousands, who would identify the progress of humanity with\r\nthe progress of infidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is, I own, a new state of things, for infidelity to profess to be a\r\ndemocrat. Hobbes, one of the fathers, if not the father, of modern\r\ninfidelity, had no sympathy with the masses; Hume and Gibbon dreamed of\r\nvery little social progress, and manifested no desire to elevate the\r\nlow, and loosen the chains of the bound. Before Thomas Paine, no infidel\r\nwriter in our language, to my knowledge, was a democrat, or thought of\r\ngiving infidelity a democratic tendency. Since his times, the infidel\r\nhas been fond of calling himself a democrat, and he has pretty generally\r\nclaimed to be the friend of the masses, and the advocate of progress. He\r\nnow labours to prove the church aristocratic, to prove that it has no\r\nregard for the melioration of man's earthly mode of being. Unhappily, in\r\nproportion as he succeeds, the church furnishes him with new instruments\r\nof success. In proportion as he seems to identify his infidelity and the\r\ndemocratic spirit, the church disowns that spirit, and declares it\r\nwholly opposed to the faith. When, some years since, the thought passed\r\nthrough my head, that there were things in society which needed mending,\r\nand I dreamed of being a social reformer I found my bitterest opponents,\r\nclergyman as I was among the clergy, and those who were most zealous for\r\nthe faith. That I erred in the inference I drew from this fact, as\r\nunbelievers now err in theirs, I am willing to own; but the fact itself\r\n_has_ the appearance of proving that religion and religion's advocates\r\nare unfriendly to social progress.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal reasons why infidelity succeeds. Its advocates\r\nmeet two great wants, that of free inquiry, and that of social\r\nprogress--two wants which are at the present time, and in this country,\r\nquite urgent--and meet them better than they are met by any of our\r\nchurches. We need not, then, ascribe their success to any peculiar\r\ndepravity of the heart, nor to an peculiar obtuseness of the\r\nunderstanding. They are right in their vindication of the rights of the\r\nmind, and in advocating social progress. They are wrong only in\r\nsupposing that free inquiry and the progress of society are elements of\r\ninfidelity, when they are only, in fact, its accidents. They constitute,\r\nin reality, two important elements of religion; as such I own them,\r\naccept them, and assure the religious everywhere that they too must\r\naccept them, or see religion for a time wholly obscured, and infidelity\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nInfidels are wrong in pretending that infidelity can effect the progress\r\nof mankind. Infidelity has no element of progress. The purest morality\r\nit enjoins is selfishness. It does not pretend to offer man any higher\r\nmotives of action than that of self-interest. But self-interest can make\r\nno man a reformer. No great reforms are ever effected without sacrifice.\r\nIn labouring for the benefit of others, we are often obliged to forget\r\nourselves, to expose ourselves, without fear and without regret, to the\r\nloss of property, ease, reputation, and sometimes of life itself. He who\r\nconsults only his own interest will never consent to be so exposed. Or\r\nadmitting that we could convince men, that to labour for a universal\r\nregeneration of mankind is for the greatest ultimate good of each one,\r\nthe experience of every day proves that no one will do it, when a small,\r\nimmediate good intervenes which it is necessary to abandon. A small,\r\nimmediate, present good always outbalances the vastly greater, but\r\ndistant good. The only principle of reform on which we can rely is\r\nlove. We must love the human race in order to be able to devote\r\nourselves to their greatest good, to be able to do and to dare\r\neverything for their progress. But we cannot love what does not appear\r\nto us _loveable_. We cannot love mankind unless we see something in them\r\nwhich is worthy to be loved. But infidelity strips man of every quality\r\nwhich we can love. In the view of the infidel, man is nothing more than\r\nan animal, born to propagate his species and die. It is religion that\r\ndiscloses man's true dignity, reveals the soul, unveils the immortality\r\nwithin us, and presents in every man the incarnate God, before whom he\r\nmay stand in awe, whom he may love and adore. Infidelity cannot, then,\r\neffect what its friends assert that it can. It cannot make us love\r\nmankind: and not being able to make us love them, it is not able to make\r\nus labour for their amelioration.\r\n\r\nBut I say this, without meaning to reproach infidels. I do and must\r\ncondemn infidelity; but I have taught myself to recognise in the infidel\r\na man, an equal, a brother, one for whom Jesus died, and for whom I,\r\ntoo, if need were, should be willing to die. I have no right to reproach\r\nthe infidel, no right to censure him for his speculative opinions. If\r\nthose opinions are wrong, as I most assuredly believe they are, it is my\r\nduty to count them his misfortune, not his crime, and to do all in my\r\npower to aid him to correct them. We wrong our brother, when we refuse\r\nhim the same tolerance for his opinions which we would have him extend\r\nto ours. We wrong Christianity, whenever we censure, ridicule, or treat\r\nwith the least possible disrespect any man for his honest opinions, be\r\nthey what they may. We have often done violence to the gospel in our\r\ntreatment of those who have, in our opinion, misinterpreted or disowned\r\nit. We have not always treated their opinions, as we ask them to treat\r\nours. We have not always been scrupulous to yield to others the rights\r\nwe claim for ourselves. We have been unjust, and our injustice has\r\nbrought, as it always must, reproach upon the opinions we avow, and the\r\ncause we profess. There was, there is, no need of being unjust, nor\r\nuncharitable to unbelievers. We believe we have the truth. Let us not so\r\nwrong the truth we advocate as to fear it can suffer by any encounter\r\nwith falsehood. Let us adopt one rule for judging all men, infidels and\r\nall; not that of their speculative opinions, but their real moral\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nI prefer to meet the infidel on his own ground; I freely accept whatever\r\nI find him advocating which I believe true, and just as freely oppose\r\nwhatever he supports which I believe to be false and mischievous. I\r\nthink him right in his vindication of free inquiry and social progress.\r\nI accept them both, not as elements of infidelity, but as elements of\r\nChristianity. Should it now be asked, as it has been, what I mean by the\r\nnew dispensation of Christianity, the new form of religion, of which I\r\nhave often spoken in this place and elsewhere, I answer, I mean\r\nreligious institutions, and modes of dispensing religious truth and\r\ninfluences, which recognise the rights of the mind, and propose social\r\nprogress as one of the great ends to be obtained. In that New Church of\r\nwhich I have sometimes dreamed, and I hope more than dreamed, I would\r\nhave the unlimited freedom of the mind unequivocally acknowledged. No\r\ninterdict should be placed upon thought. To reason should be a\r\nchristian, not an infidel, act. Every man should be encouraged to\r\ninquire, and to inquire not a little merely, within certain prescribed\r\nlimits; but freely, fearlessly, fully, to scan heaven, air, ocean,\r\nearth, and to master God, nature, and humanity, if he can. He who\r\ninquires for truth honestly, faithfully, perseveringly, to the utmost\r\nextent of his power, does all that can be asked of him; he does God's\r\nwill, and should be allowed to abide by his own conclusions, without\r\nfear of reproach from God or man.\r\n\r\nIn asserting this I am but recalling the community to Christianity.\r\nJesus reproved the Jews for not of themselves judging what is right,\r\nthus plainly recognising in them, and if in them in us, both the right\r\nand the power to judge for themselves. \"If I do not the works of my\r\nFather,\" says Jesus, \"believe me not;\" obviously implying both man's\r\nright and ability to determine what are, and what are not, \"works of the\r\nFather:\" that is, in other words, what is or what is not truth. An\r\napostle commands us to \"stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has\r\nmade us free,\" \"to prove all things,\" and to \"hold fast that which is\r\ngood.\" In fact, the very spirit of the gospel is that of freedom; it is\r\ncalled a \"law of liberty,\" and its great end is to free the soul from\r\nall restraint, but that of its obligation to do right. They wrong it who\r\nwould restrain thought, and hand-cuff inquiry; they doubt or deny its\r\ntruth and power who fear to expose it to the severest scrutiny, the most\r\nsearching investigation; and, were I in an accusing mood, I would bring\r\nthe charge of infidelity against every one who will not or dare not\r\ninquire, who will not or dare not encourage inquiry in others.\r\n\r\nI have said that social progress must enter into the church I would have\r\nestablished, as one of the ends to be gained. Social progress holds a\r\ngreat place in the sentiments of this age. Infidels seize upon it; find\r\nin it one of the most powerful elements of their success. I too would\r\nseize upon it, give it a religious direction, and find in it an element\r\nof the triumph of Christianity. I have a right to it. As a Christian, I\r\nam bound to rescue social progress, or if you please, the democratic\r\nspirit, from the possession of the infidel. He has no right to it; he\r\nhas usurped it through the negligence of the church. It is a christian\r\nspirit. Jesus was the man, the teacher of the masses. They were\r\nfishermen, deemed the lowest of his countrymen, who were his apostles;\r\nthey were the \"common people,\" who heard him gladly; they were the\r\nPharisee and Sadducee, the chief priest and scribe, the rich and the\r\ndistinguished, in one word the aristocracy of that age, who conspired\r\nagainst him, and caused him to be crucified between two thieves. He\r\nhimself professed to be anointed of God, _because_ he was anointed to\r\npreach the gospel to the poor, to proclaim liberty to them that are\r\nbound, and to let the captive go free. To John he expressly assigns the\r\nkindling fact, that the poor had the gospel preached unto them, as the\r\nmost striking proof of his claims to the Messiahship.\r\n\r\nAnd what was this gospel which was preached to the poor? Was it a gospel\r\nsuited to the views of the Autocrat of the Russias, such as despots ever\r\nlove? Did it command the poor, in the name of God, to submit to an order\r\nof things of which they are the victims, to be contented to pine in\r\nneglect, and die of wretchedness? No, no: Jesus preached no such\r\ntyrant-pleasing and tyrant-sustaining gospel. The gospel which he\r\npreached, was the gospel of human brotherhood. He preached the gospel,\r\nthe holy evangile, good news to the poor, when he proclaimed them\r\nmembers of the common family of man, when he taught that we are all\r\nbrethren, having one and the same Father in heaven; he preached the\r\ngospel to the poor, when he declared to the boastingly religious of his\r\nage, that even publicans and harlots would go into the kingdom of heaven\r\nsooner than they; when he declared that the poor widow, who out of her\r\nnecessities, cast her two mites into the treasury of the Lord, cast in\r\nmore than all the rich; and whoever preaches the universal fraternity of\r\nthe human race, preaches the gospel to the poor, though he speak only to\r\nthe rich.\r\n\r\nThere is power in this great doctrine of the universal brotherhood of\r\nmankind. It gives the reformer a mighty advantage. It enables him to\r\nspeak words of an import, and in a tone, which may almost wake the dead.\r\nHold thy hand, oppressor, it permits him to say, thou wrongest a\r\nbrother! Withhold thy scorn, thou bitter satirist of the human race,\r\nthou vilifiest thy brother! In passing by that child in the street\r\nyesterday, and leaving it to grow up in ignorance and vice,\r\nnotwithstanding God had given thee wealth to train it to knowledge and\r\nvirtue, thou didst neglect thy brother's child. Oh, did we but feel this\r\ntruth, that we are all brothers and sisters, children of the same\r\nparent, we should feel that every wrong done to a human being, was\r\nviolence done to our own flesh!\r\n\r\nI say again, that Jesus was emphatically the teacher of the masses; the\r\nprophet of the working men if you will; of all those who \"labour and are\r\nheavy laden.\" Were I to repeat his words in this city or elsewhere, with\r\nthe intimation that I believed they meant something; were I to say, as\r\nhe said, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,\r\nthan for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven,\" and to say it in a\r\ntone that indicated I believed he attached any meaning to what he said,\r\nyou would call me a \"radical,\" an \"agrarian,\" a \"trades unionist,\" a\r\n\"leveller,\" a \"disorganiser,\" or some other name equally barbarous and\r\nhorrific. It were more than a man's reputation for sanity, or\r\nrespectability as a _Christian_, is worth, to be as bold even in these\r\ndays in defence of the \"common people\" as Jesus was.\r\n\r\nI say still again, that Jesus was emphatically the teacher of the\r\nmasses, the prophet of the people. Not that he addressed himself to any\r\none description of persons to the exclusion of another, not that he\r\nsought to benefit one portion of the human race at another's expense;\r\nfor if any one thing more than another distinguished him, it was, that\r\nhe rose above all the factitious distinctions of society, and spoke to\r\nuniversal man, to the universal mind, and to the universal heart. I call\r\nhim the prophet of the people, because he recognised the rights of\r\nhumanity; brought out, and suffered and died to establish principles,\r\nwhich in their legitimate effect, cannot fail to bring up the low and\r\nbowed down, and give to the many, who, in all ages, and in all\r\ncountries, have been the tools of the few, their due rank and social\r\nimportance. His spirit, in its political aspect, is what I have called\r\nthe democratic spirit; in its most general aspect, it is the spirit of\r\nprogress, in the individual and in the race, towards perfection, towards\r\nunion with God. It is that spirit which for eighteen hundred years has\r\nbeen at work in society, like the leaven hidden in three measures of\r\nmeal; before which slavery, in nearly all Christendom, has disappeared;\r\nwhich has destroyed the warrior aristocracy, nearly subdued the\r\naristocracy of birth, which is now struggling with the aristocracy of\r\nwealth, and which promises, ere long, to bring up and establish the true\r\naristocracy--the aristocracy of merit.\r\n\r\nIf it be now asked, as it has been asked, to what denomination I belong,\r\nI reply, that I belong to that denomination, whose starting point is\r\nfree inquiry, which acknowledges in good faith, and without any mental\r\nreservation, the rights of the mind, and which proposes the melioration\r\nof man's earthly mode of being, as one of the great ends of its labours.\r\nI know not that such a denomination exists. I know, in fact, of no\r\ndenomination, which, _as a denomination_, fully meets the wants of the\r\ntimes. Yet let me not be misinterpreted. I am not here to accuse, or to\r\nmake war upon, any existing denomination; I contend with no church; I\r\nhave no controversy with my Calvinistic brother, none with my Arminian,\r\nUnitarian, or Trinitarian brother. Every church has its idea, its truth;\r\nand more truth, much more, I believe, than any one church will admit of\r\nin those from which it differs. For myself, I delight to find truth in\r\nall churches, and I own it wherever I find it; but still I must say, I\r\nfind no church which owns, as its central truth, the great central truth\r\nof Christianity--a truth which may now be brought out of the darkness in\r\nwhich it has remained, and which it is now more than ever necessary to\r\nreinstate in its rights.\r\n\r\nLet me say, then, that though I am here for an object, which is not, to\r\nmy knowledge, the special object of any existing church, I am not here\r\nto make war upon any church, nor to injure any one in the least possible\r\ndegree. I would that they all had as much fellowship for one another, as\r\nI have for them all! I interfere with none of them. I am here for a\r\nspecial object, but one so high, one so broad, they may all cooperate in\r\ngaining it. My creed is a simple one. Its first article is, free,\r\nunlimited inquiry, perfect liberty to enjoy and express one's own honest\r\nconvictions, and perfect respect for the free and honest inquirer,\r\nwhatever be the results to which he arrives. The second article is\r\nsocial progress. I would have it a special object of the society I would\r\ncollect, to labour to perfect all social institutions, and raise every\r\nman to a social position, which will give him free scope for the full\r\nand harmonious development of all his faculties. I say, _perfect_, not\r\ndestroy, all social institutions. I do not feel that God has given me a\r\nwork of destruction. I would improve, preserve, whatever is good, and\r\nremedy whatever is defective, and thus reconcile the CONSERVATOR and the\r\nRADICAL. My third article is, that man should labour for his soul in\r\npreference to his body. Man has a soul; he is not mere body. He has more\r\nthan animal wants. He has a soul, which is in relation with the absolute\r\nand the Infinite--a soul, which is for ever rushing off into the\r\nunknown, and rising through a universe of darkness up to the \"first Good\r\nand the first Fair.\" This soul is immortal. To perfect it is our highest\r\naim. I would encourage inquiry; I would perfect society, not as ultimate\r\nends, but as means to the growth and maturity of man's higher\r\nnature--his soul.\r\n\r\nThese are my views, and views which, I believe, meet the wants of the\r\ntimes. They make war upon no sect of Christians. They are adopted in the\r\nspirit of love to humanity, and they can be acted upon only in the\r\nspirit of peace. They threaten no hostility, except to sin: with that,\r\nindeed, they call us to war. We must fight against all unrighteousness,\r\nagainst spiritual wickedness in high places, and in low places; but the\r\nweapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual. We must go forth\r\nto the battle in faith and love, go forth to vindicate the rights of the\r\nmind, to perfect society, to make it the abode of all the virtues, and\r\nall the graces, to clothe man in his native dignity, and enable him to\r\nlook forth in the image of his Maker upon a world of beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is my object. I am not here to preach to working men, nor to those\r\nwho are not working men, in the interests of aristocracy, nor of\r\ndemocracy. I am here for humanity; to plead for universal man; to unfurl\r\nthe banner of the cross on a new and more commanding position, and call\r\nthe human race around it. I am here to speak to all who feel themselves\r\nhuman beings; to all whose hearts swell at the name of man; to all who\r\nlong to lessen the sum of human misery, and increase that of human\r\nhappiness; to all who have any perception of the Beautiful and Good, and\r\na craving for the Infinite, the Eternal, and Indestructible, on whom to\r\nrepose the wearied soul and find rest--to all such is my appeal: to them\r\nI commit the object I have stated, and before which I stand in awe, and\r\nentreat them by all that is good in their natures, holy in religion, or\r\ndesirable in the joy of a regenerated world, to unite and march to its\r\nacquisition, prepared to dare with the hero, to suffer with the saint,\r\nor to die with the martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Independently of the disinterestedness, simplicity, and humility of\r\nwoman's character, in all matters relating to religion, they naturally\r\nreverence and cling to those who show them respect and deference. The\r\nclergy, from understanding this point in their nature, possess great and\r\ndeserved influence over them; and they have only to interest their\r\nfeelings, to insure success to any clerical or charitable purpose. Look\r\nat a woman's zeal in foreign or domestic missions, not only devoting her\r\ntime at home, but leaving her friends and her comforts, to assist in\r\nestablishing them in a distant land. And is it ever pretended that a\r\nwoman has not _more_ than equalled a man in these duties? And will she\r\nnot toil for days, scarcely raising her eyes from the work, to assist in\r\npurchasing an organ, a new altar-cloth, or in cleaning and painting a\r\nchurch?\r\n\r\nSo great is the tax, now, on a woman's time, for these and for other\r\nreligious purposes, such as the \"educating young men for the ministry,\"\r\nthat the amount is frightful and scandalous. If the funds of a\r\nreligious congregation be low, which can only happen where the men are\r\npoor in spirit, and wanting in religious fervour, a woman is allowed to\r\nexert herself beyond her means; for well we know that she cannot endure\r\na want of neatness and order, in a house where God is to be worshipped.\r\nTo be sure, it may be said, that no one compels her to this unequal\r\nshare of labour; but we know how the thing operates.\r\n\r\nShe ought, and she does, and nobly does her share, in educating poor\r\nchildren, both during the week and on Sunday. She searches out the widow\r\nand the fatherless, the orphan, the sick and the poor, the aged and the\r\nunhappy. All this, although it amount to a great deal, and certainly\r\nmuch more than men can ever do, it is her duty to do, and she performs\r\nthe duty cheerfully. As she considers it incumbent on her thus to exert\r\nherself, and as it gives her pleasure, there can be no objection on our\r\npart, to let her do all the good in this way that she can; but do not\r\nlet us exact too much of a willing mind and tender conscience. Confiding\r\nin her spiritual directors, she may be brought to do more than is proper\r\nfor her to do. This \"educating of young men, this preparing them for a\r\ntheological seminary,\" is _not_ part of a woman's duty, and it is not\r\nonly contemptible, but base, to allow such a discipline of their minds,\r\nas to make them imagine it to be their duty.\r\n\r\nLook at the young men who are to be educated? What right have they, with\r\nso many sources open to them, what right have they to allow women to tax\r\nthemselves for their maintenance? Poor credulous woman! she can be made\r\nto think anything a duty. How have we seen her neglecting her health,\r\nher comfort, her family, the poor, and, above all, neglecting the\r\nimprovement of her own mind, that she might earn a few dollars towards\r\neducating a young man, who is far more able to do it himself, and who,\r\nnine times in ten, laughs in his sleeve at her. What right, we again\r\nask, have these young men to the labours of a woman? Are they not as\r\ncapable of working as she is? What should hinder them from pursuing some\r\nhandicraft, some employment, during their term of study?\r\n\r\nIf a woman were to be educated gratis, in this way, would any set of\r\nyoung men associate and work for her maintenance? No, that they would\r\nnot; she would not only have to labour for herself, but her labour would\r\nbe unaided even by sympathy. Now, very few women are aware, that they\r\nare, _in a manner_, manoeuvred into thus spending their precious time;\r\nwe mean for the education of young men that have a desire to enter the\r\ntheological seminary. Many of them are not conscious of being swayed by\r\nother motives; indeed, some have no other motive, than that of pure\r\nchristian love, when they thus assist in raising funds for educating\r\nyoung men. They feel a disposition to follow on, in any scheme proposed\r\nto them; and when the thing is rightly managed, the project has the\r\nappearance of originating with themselves. Men understand the mode of\r\ndoing this.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of piety and charity is very strong in the bosom of a woman;\r\nshe feels the deepest reverence and devotion towards her spiritual\r\npastor, and is naturally, therefore, disposed to do good, in the way he\r\nthinks best. If it were not for this reverence and submission, if they\r\nwere left unbiassed by hint, persuasion, or by some unaccountable spell\r\nwhich they cannot break through, their charities would find another and\r\na more suitable channel. Their good sense would show them the\r\nimpropriety of giving up so much of their time, for a purpose that\r\nbelongs exclusively to the care of men: they would soon see the truth,\r\nas it appears to others, that the scheme must be a bad one, which\r\nenables young men to live in idleness, during the time that they are\r\ngetting through with their classical studies:--such a \"getting through,\"\r\ntoo, as it generally is.\r\n\r\nWe do not set forth the following plan, as the very best that can be\r\noffered, but it is practicable, and would be creditable. It is that\r\nevery theological seminary should have sufficient ground attached to it,\r\nthat each student might have employment in raising vegetables and fruit.\r\nThere should likewise be a workshop connected with it, wherein he might\r\npursue some trade; so that if he did not find it his vocation to preach,\r\nwhen his religious education was finished, he might not be utterly\r\ndestitute, as too many are. In fact, it ought to be so much the part of\r\na clergyman's education, to be acquainted with certain branches of\r\nhorticulture, that he should not receive a call to a country or village\r\nchurch, if he were ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nSo far from degrading, it would be doing these young men a kindness. In\r\nthe first place, they would hold fast that spirit of independence which\r\nis so necessary to a man's prosperity, and to his usefulness as a\r\nclergyman. He would be of the greatest consequence to his parishioners,\r\nfor horticulture is an art but little known to them; and even if they go\r\nto a great distance as missionaries, of what great service would his\r\nhorticultural knowledge be to the poor people, whose souls he hopes to\r\nsave! We all know how immediately civilisation follows the cultivation\r\nof the soil; and we may rest assured, that the sacred object which the\r\nyoung missionary has in view, will meet with fewer obstacles, if his\r\nlessons are connected with attention to the bodily wants of his charge.\r\n\r\nIt is really disgusting to those who live in the neighbourhood of\r\nreligious institutions, to see the frivolous manner in which young men\r\npass their time, when not in actual study. We do not say that they are\r\ndissipated, or vicious, in the common sense of the word, but that they\r\nlounge about, trifle, and gossip, retailing idle chit-chat and\r\nfooleries.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when they are thus happily amusing themselves, the\r\nwomen who assist in giving them a classical education allow themselves\r\nscarcely any respite from their labours. We have known some of them to\r\nsew,--it is all they can do,--from sunrise till nine o'clock at night;\r\nand all for this very purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is quite time to put a stop to this, and let indigent young men\r\neducate themselves. Why do they not form societies to create funds for\r\nthe purpose,--not as is usually done whenever they have attempted a\r\nthing of this kind, by carrying about a paper to collect money, but _by\r\nextra labour of their own, as women do_? Let those who live in cities\r\nwrite for lawyers or clerks in chancery, or make out accounts for poor\r\nshopkeeping women, who will never cheat them out of a cent, nor refuse\r\nthem a just compensation. If it be said that they cannot write well\r\nenough for any of these purposes, then they must go to the free-school\r\nagain. There are a hundred modes by which they could earn at least\r\ntwenty-five cents a day,--which is the average of what a woman makes\r\nwhen she is employed in sewing for this purpose. Those who live in the\r\ncountry,--where, in fact, all students, rich or poor, ought to be, on\r\naccount of health,--should raise fruit, vegetables, we mean assist in\r\nthis, work at some trade, write for newspapers, teach the children of\r\nthe families at extra hours; in short, a lad of independent spirit could\r\ndevise ways and means enough to pay for his board and clothing while he\r\nis learning Latin and Greek. This plan of proceeding would raise a young\r\nman twice as much in the opinion of the public, and a thousand times as\r\nmuch in his own.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a time to dwell on such a subject; it was too important,\r\nhowever, to remain untouched. We intend to discuss it amply at some\r\nfuture period. Our object, at present, is to assist women. They who are\r\nalways so willing to assist others, to their own detriment, should now,\r\nin turn,--for their wants loudly call for it,--be assisted and\r\nencouraged to strike out a new path, by which they could assist\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe first step for us to take in order to effect our intentions, is to\r\nprove to them that they should attend to their own wants exclusively;\r\nwork for their own sons, if those sons can bear to see it; but to let\r\nyoung men, unconnected with them, and who are destined for the ministry,\r\neducate themselves, as the poor young men of other professions do.\r\n\r\nWhen do we ever hear that a lawyer or a doctor owed their education to\r\nthe industry or the alms of women?\r\n\r\nWe have said all this before, and in nearly the same words; and we shall\r\nsay it again and again. There must be a change for the better in the\r\naffairs of poor women; they are degraded by their poverty; and their\r\ndegradation is the cause of nearly all the crime that is\r\ncommitted.\"--_Aladdin's Lamp.
