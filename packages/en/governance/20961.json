I have never\r\nliked the kind of play-house that politicians have made on that\r\nglorious plateau in a valley of wonderland with a river of dreams\r\nrolling past to the sea.  Where under heaven is any other Capital so\r\nfavoured by the great scenic artist?  On what promontory do\r\nparliamentary towers and gables so colossally arise to enchant the\r\nvision?  The Thames draws the ships of the world and crawls muddily and\r\nlazily out to sea wondering what haphazard of history ever concentrated\r\nso much commerce, politics and human splendour on the banks of one\r\nlarge ditch.  Ottawa's house of political drama overlooks one of the\r\nnoblest rivers in the world, that takes its rise in everlasting hills\r\nof granite and pines.\r\n\r\nOne, Laurier, used to dream that he would devote his declining days to\r\nmaking Ottawa beautiful as a city as she is for the site of a capital.\r\nTo him as to others, Rome, London, Paris, Vienna, Washington, should\r\nall in time be rivalled by Ottawa the magnificent.  But the saw-mill\r\nsurveyors of Ottawa spoiled that when they made no approach to\r\nParliament Hill to compare to the vista seen from the river.  Ottawa\r\nwas built for convenience: for opportunity: for expediency.\r\n\r\nParliament is its great show.  Politicians are the actors.  Time has\r\nseen some interesting, almost baffling, dramas on that hill.  No other\r\nParliament stands midway of so vast a country.  But there are people\r\nwho prefer Hull, P.Q., to Ottawa, Ont.  We have had some mild Mephistos\r\nof strategy up there: some prophets of eloquence: some dreamers of\r\nimagination: giants of creative energy scheming how to draw a young,\r\nvast country together into nationhood so that the show-men on\r\nParliament Hill might have an audience.\r\n\r\nBut the Ottawa of to-day is a strange spectacle for the prophets.  The\r\ngreat new Opera House is all but finished, when no seer can tell\r\nwhether the plays to be put on there by the parties of the future will\r\nbe as epical and worthwhile as those staged by the actors of the past.\r\nImagination was not absent when Ottawa was created.  But it needs more\r\nthan common imagination to foresee whether these political playboys of\r\nthe northern world are going to be worthy of the great audience soon to\r\narise in the country that converges upon Ottawa.\r\n\r\nSometimes in Parliament you catch the vibration of big momentums in a\r\nnation's progress.  Voices now and then arise in speech that reflect\r\nsome greatness of vision.  More often the actors are sitting\r\nindolently, hearing the clack of worn-out principals whose struts and\r\ngrimaces and cadences are those of men whose cues should lead them to\r\nthe dressing rooms, or to the wings, or somewhere into the maze of the\r\nback drop where nobody takes part in the show.  Or they listen to men\r\nwhose big informing idea constantly is that all we need to make\r\neconomic happiness for everybody is to turn out the company now in and\r\nget another from the furrows.  These latter believe that a nation is a\r\ncondition of free trade--mainly on behalf of the farmer whose average\r\nidea of industry is a blacksmith shop on a farm.\r\n\r\nOne's head inclines to ache by reason of listening to the\r\nthree-cornered claque on the Tariff as it was in the beginning, is now\r\nand ever shall be.  Now and again we are inclined to study the men who\r\nare elected to Parliament and some of those who gravitate towards\r\nOttawa without the bother of elections.  They stimulate interest and\r\nchallenge criticism, not less because the interest and the criticism\r\ncome from a seat in the audience rather than from \"behind the\r\nscenes\"--which is not always a disadvantage.  While the\r\nparliamentarians perform \"Promises and Pie Crusts\", the wives have\r\ntheir own play--\"Petticoats and Power\".  The stage here is a\r\ntriangle--Rideau Hall, Chateau Laurier, the Parliamentary Restaurant.\r\nAt the cafe tables women from all the counties and electoral districts\r\nof Canada--many of them French--chatter about the great masquerade up\r\nat the Castle, the little-king show which at its best is worth more to\r\nCanada than the Senate.  The homes of Ottawa are little shows whose\r\nplayers imitate the manners and the accents of the fine people in the\r\nCastle, the Restaurant and the Chateau.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but a prinked-up panorama!\" says the rugged Radical in a\r\ncoonskin coat, member of a deputation with a railway ticket as long as\r\nhis pocket.  \"Poor show!  What we want down here is more plain farmers'\r\nwives----\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses.  This man's first cousin broke away from the farm a\r\ngeneration ago because farmers' wives were too plain, and farmers did\r\nso little reading, and the big thinkers and doers all seemed to live in\r\ntown.  As he talks, up dashes a sleigh, jangling its bells and dangling\r\nits robes, and from behind the bearskinned driver alights a company\r\nthat makes his coonskin coat feel clumsy and uncomfortable.  He glances\r\nup at the great pile of walls on the hill.  The hill is alive with fine\r\npeople.  In one of the sleighs a lady bows and smiles--at him!  He\r\ntouches his cap and takes his pipe from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"That lady?\" he replies to his sleeping-car mate.  \"Oh, that is the\r\nwife of a Senator, used to live in our town.  Clever little woman she\r\nis, too.  They tell me she's writing a novel and that Lady Byng is\r\ntaking her up.  Lady Byng--oh, yes, she writes novels.  Good idea.\r\nLikely her books won't be quite so rough as some of our Canadian novels\r\nare.  I like style in a book, all that fine manners stuff; takes your\r\nmind off the humdrum of everyday life.  Byng--say, that was a wise\r\nappointment if ever there was one.  My way of thinking, Lord Byng has\r\n'em all beaten since Dufferin.  Kings' and queens' uncles and cousins\r\nand brothers don't suit this democratic nation like a man who got\r\nacquainted with this country before ever he set eyes on it, through the\r\nboys he commanded out yonder.  Great man!  Fit to be Governor-General\r\nof a great country, and I won't deny it.  No snobbery.  Seventh son of\r\nan earl, all his life a soldier and a worker.  A real man, such as any\r\nof us could present to our constituents with pleasure and pride.  Tell\r\nyou what--listen!\"\r\n\r\nHis sleeping-car mate feels a heavy clutch on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Remember the old debate we used to have about 'The pen is mightier\r\nthan the sword'?  Well, say--when you get the pen and the sword united\r\nin one outfit--what about it?  Oh, it's a great show, sure enough.  I\r\nused to think government was a plain, plugshot business of trade\r\nstatistics, card indexes and ledgers.  But I've come to the conclusion\r\nthat this old town has to make it a good bit of a social compromise and\r\na show, or it can't be carried on, no matter who does it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNELECTED PREMIER OF CANADA--\r\n    RT.

HON. ARTHUR MEIGHEN\r\n\r\nOnce only have I encountered Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen, Premier of Canada\r\nby divine right, not as yet by election.  I was the 347th person with\r\nwhom he shook hands and whom he tried to recognize that afternoon.  His\r\nweary but peculiarly winning smile had scarcely flickered to rest for a\r\nmoment in an hour.  For the eleven seconds that it was my privilege to\r\nbe individually sociable with him, he did his best to say what might\r\nsuit the case.  He seemed much like a worn-out precocious boy, of great\r\nwisdom and much experience, suddenly prodded into an eminence which as\r\nyet he scarcely understood.\r\n\r\nI was introduced as--say, Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" he said, wearily.  \"Yes, I've read your articles.  Er--Tom Smith,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\nBut Tom was not the name, I had scarcely time to say, and it made no\r\ndifference.  I should like to have shoo'd away the crowd and let him\r\ncall me Jake just for a few minutes to get the point of feeling of this\r\nyoung man--though he is nearly 50--on how it feels to be Premier\r\nwithout a general election.\r\n\r\nThere may not be as much finality, but there is sometimes as much\r\nwisdom, in the choice of a leader by a small group as in his election\r\nby the people.  Majorities frequently rule without wisdom.  In\r\naccepting the gift of an almost worn-out Premiership and a year later\r\nentering the most significant general election ever held in Canada, at\r\nleast since 1878, Arthur Meighen falls back upon his courage without\r\nmuch comfort from ordinary ambition.  He faces a battle whose armies\r\nare new, pledged to hold what he has against two enemy groups, and to\r\nhold more than John A. Macdonald fought to get, without the sense of\r\none great party against another such as Macdonald had.  No Premier ever\r\nwent into a general election with so little intimate support from \"the\r\nold party\", with such a certainty that whichever party wins as against\r\nthe others cannot win a working majority without coalition, and with\r\nthe sensation that the party he leads is already what remains of a\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\nWhenever I see Meighen I feel like hastening home to \"cram\" on\r\ncitizenship for an examination.  I behold in him picnics neglected and\r\neven feminine society deferred for the sake of toiling up a political\r\nParnassus.  In his veneration for constituted authority I can\r\ncomprehend something of the Jap's banzais to the Mikado before he\r\ncommits harikari.\r\n\r\nWhatever there is, or is not, in the character of Arthur Meighen, he\r\nhas a draw upon other men.  Any public task that he has in hand looks\r\nlike a load that challenges other men to help him lift.  A really\r\nintelligent camera would show in his face a mixture of wholesome\r\npugnacity, concentration of thought and feminine tenderness.  He feels\r\nlike a big intellectual boy who unless mother looks after him will get\r\nindigestion or neurasthenia.  Sometimes men pity their leaders.\r\nMeighen, with his intensity and his thought before action looks such a\r\nfrail wisp of a man.  The last time I saw him in public he was\r\nbare-headed on an open-air stage, a dusky, lean silhouette against a\r\nvast flare of water and sky.  On the same spot less than two hundred\r\nyears ago, that singular, overbuilt top head and sharply tapering,\r\nelongated oval of a face might have been that of some aristocratic red\r\nman, deeply serious on the eve of a tribal war.\r\n\r\nThe little blank spots in Meighen's temperament are things that people\r\nlike to talk about; when the same idioms in an average man would be set\r\ndown as mild insanity.  Rumour says for instance that every now and\r\nthen he must be watched for fear he go to Parliament without a hat.\r\nWhy not?  It is only a British custom to wear a hat in the Commons\r\nexcept when making a speech.  A bareheaded, even a bald-headed, Premier\r\nmay be a great man.  Meighen's negligence in the matter of a hat\r\nperhaps comes of the bother of finding the clothes-brush at the same\r\ntime.  Since Mackenzie Bowell, Canada has never had a Premier so\r\nnaturally oblivious of sartorial style; though his later appearances\r\nsuggest that even he has fallen into the mode of well-dressed Premiers.\r\nIn his early law days at Portage it is said that one evening when Mrs.\r\nMeighen was at a concert, he was given the first baby to mind, that\r\nwhen the baby cried he marked a paragraph in a law book he was reading,\r\nstole into the bedroom and took the baby over to a neighbour's house;\r\nthat when he was asked later where the infant was he gradually\r\nremembered that he had put the child somewhere--now where was it?\r\nThere is some other half forgotten tale of the strange garb in which he\r\nturned up at a friend's wedding, even before he was famous enough to be\r\nable to do that sort of thing with any degree of contempt for the\r\nconventional forms.\r\n\r\nIf Meighen remains Premier of Canada long enough, no doubt some really\r\napocryphal yarns will arise out of these little idiosyncracies, just as\r\nlegends wove themselves about John A. Macdonald, and Laurier.  I\r\nremember that the clothes Meighen wore the day I shook hands with him\r\nwere dingy brown that made him look like a moulting bobolink; that he\r\nhad not taken the trouble to shave because a sleeping car is such an\r\nawkward place for a razor, and it is much better for a Premier to wear\r\nbristles than court-plaster.  Some one will be sure to remark that the\r\nPremier travels in a private car.  Arthur Meighen never seems like that\r\nsort of Premier.  One would almost expect him to choose an upper berth\r\nbecause some less lean and agile person might need the lower.\r\n\r\nNo doubt much of Meighen's democratic _gaucherie_ about garments was\r\nabandoned at the Imperial Conference.  He never could have worn a dingy\r\nbrown suit when he got the freedom of London.  Upon some State occasion\r\nthe Premier may have worn the Windsor uniform.  Not without scruples.\r\nThat uniform may not misbecome constricted Mr. Meighen more than it did\r\nthe spare Mr. Foster, or the lean Mr. Rowell.  But the Windsor uniform\r\nspells conformity, colonialism, Empire--not commonwealth.  And Mr.\r\nMeighen went to London to represent the Commonwealth of Canada.\r\n\r\nWe were told by cable that the Premier took part in most of the sports\r\non board ship, and of course lost most of the events.  Well, there is\r\nno harm in a Premier beginning to be whimsically athletic near fifty.\r\nBut, unless now and then he could manage to win something it was\r\nobviously only an attempt to make him interesting to the cables, on the\r\nprinciple that a polar bear is prodded in a cage to make him perform\r\nfor the \"lidy\".\r\n\r\nWeeks before he went the Premier foreshadowed the attitude he would\r\ntake at the Conference.  Again and again it was repeated as he slowly\r\nleft the country, even pausing at Quebec to say it again; and\r\nthereafter the cables took it up, repeating it over and over, until the\r\npeople of Canada began to suspect that the correspondents were almost\r\nas hard up for news as some of them were during the war.  Mr. Grattan\r\nO'Leary knew he had a difficult character to popularize on the cable; a\r\nman who until he became Premier, outside of Parliament was as diffident\r\nas the hero in \"She Stoops to Conquer\"; at High School in the little\r\nstone town of St. Mary's, Ont., so studious that he never could catch a\r\nbaseball that wanted to drop into his pocket; at college immersed in\r\nmathematics, at Osgoode in law; as a young man opening a forlorn office\r\nin Portage, still a sort of lariat town, when Meighen was shy of even a\r\nfamily saddle-horse.\r\n\r\nIn Portage Meighen lived in a weather-boarded frame house, during the\r\ntime when in bigger Western towns other politicians were putting up\r\nlittle palaces, causing their electoral enemies to wonder where they\r\ngot the money.  In Ottawa when he became Premier he lived in one of the\r\nplainest houses, with no decorative fads, no celebrated pictures, not\r\nmuch music, but plenty of room for the juveniles; described by a\r\npolitical writer who was there the evening of the appointment as \"just\r\ncomfortable.\"  He was at home that evening, discussing simply a number\r\nof public matters, but not a word about the Premiership, till as the\r\nvisitor was rising to go and said, \"Oh, by the way--permit me to\r\ncongratulate you,\" Meighen broke into his bewildered smile and said\r\nbluntly, \"Thanks!\"  He was not outwardly impressed by the least\r\nimpressive Premiership that ever happened.  The nation had nothing to\r\ndo with it.  Meighen had not been elected.  He had drafted no platform\r\nbefore he became Premier.  He did it afterwards.  All that happened was\r\na change of captains on a ship.\r\n\r\nMeighen had been spiritual adviser to Borden in other remakings of his\r\nCabinet.  This time he was not consulted.  Sir Robert never had such a\r\npredicament.  In the words of the old song, \"There were three crows sat\r\non a tree.\"  The names of the crows were--White, Meighen, Rowell.\r\nTheir common name was Barkis.  Which should it be?  White\r\nechoed--Which?  So did they all.  Great affairs are sometimes so\r\nchildlike.  Meighen was willing to accept White as Premier.  White had\r\nbeen for years in the spotlight.  Did he hope, or expect, that Sir\r\nThomas would refuse?  We are not told.  But he must have surmised.  In\r\nany case White was off the ship.\r\n\r\nThe choice came down to two.  Here again it was a spotlight man--or\r\nMeighen.  Rowell had become famous when Meighen had not; but he was a\r\nconverted Liberal, and of only three years' experience.  The necessity\r\nwas obvious.  Sir Thomas, declining the leadership, must have\r\nrecommended Meighen, much to the Premier's joy.\r\n\r\nYes, it was time for a leader.  Mr. Rowell was out--and off the ship.\r\nHappily there were no more crows on the tree, or Meighen would have\r\nbeen forced to hold an election in order to get a Cabinet.\r\n\r\nHowever, the three of them consented to remain in the crew, until\r\nfurther notice.  Thus much was settled.  Meighen should lead,--but\r\nwhat?  As yet little more than a hyphenated and quite stupid name,\r\nwhich had never yet resolved itself into a platform.  But the name and\r\nthe platform were both as clear as the constitution of the party, in\r\nwhich, under the political microscope, there was clearly discernible a\r\nUnionist Centre, a Tory Right and a Liberal left.\r\n\r\n\"Lacks solidarity,\" mutters Meighen.  \"Looks like tick-tack-toe.  But\r\nwait.\"\r\n\r\nThe third disturbing feature was the condition of the country.  From\r\nhis wheel-house Meighen could see many clouds.  The Reds, whom he had\r\nruthlessly handled in the Winnipeg Strike; the rather pink-looking\r\nAgrarians; the Drury Lane coalition of farmers and labourites in\r\nOntario; Quebec almost solid Liberal behind Lapointe; Liberals angling\r\nfor alliance with Agrarians; Lenin poisoning the Empire wells of India\r\nwith Bolshevism; League of Nations every now and then sending out an\r\nS.O.S., interrupted in transit by Lord Cecil or Sir Herbert Ames;\r\nand--not least threatening of storms but if properly negotiated\r\nfavourable to this country on the Pacific issue--Mr. Harding busy on a\r\n\"just-as-good\" substitute for the League of Nations with Washington as\r\na new-world centre when Mr. Meighen had hitherto neglected to advocate\r\na Canadian envoy to that Capital.\r\n\r\nHaving scanned all these weather signals, Mr. Meighen decided that\r\ndiplomacy for the present was dangerous and that boldness was better.\r\nIn his programme speech at Stirling he divided the nation into two\r\ngroups--that of authority and order to which he belonged, and the\r\nheterogeneous group of incipient anarchism to which belonged all those\r\nwho did not agree with him.\r\n\r\nHaving done this with such further definition of his programme as might\r\nbe necessary, the Premier took a trip to the West to prepare the way\r\nfor Sir Henry Drayton's tariff tour.  He went to that land of minor\r\nrevolutions as a representative of government by authority, high\r\ntariff, conscription during the war, the Wartime Elections Act, and a\r\nminimum of centrality in the Empire as opposed to a maximum of\r\nautonomy.  It was a disquieting outlook.  But Westerners love to hear a\r\nman hit hard when he talks.  Meighen has often been bold both in speech\r\nand action.  In the Commons last session he paid his respects to Mr.\r\nCrerar by calling the National Progressives \"a dilapidated annex to the\r\nLiberal party.\"  Which adroit play to the gallery with a paradox came\r\nback in the shape of a boomerang from a Westerner who called the\r\nGovernment party \"an exploded blister.\"  On a previous occasion talking\r\nto the boot manufacturers in convention at Quebec he took a leap into\r\nthe Agrarian trench with this pack of muddled metaphors.  \"I see the\r\nAgrarians a full-fledged army on the march to submarine our fiscal\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nEpigrams like these do not make great Premiers.  But they are the kind\r\nof schooling that Meighen had.  In his young parliament days he was an\r\noutrageously tiresome speaker.  He heaped up metaphors and hyperboles,\r\nparaded lumbering predicates and hurled out epithets, foaming and\r\nfloundering.  He had started so many things in a speech that he scarce\r\nknew when or how to stop.  Commons, both sides, rather liked to hear\r\nhim struggle with his verbiage.  Later he developed the rapier thrust,\r\nsome snatches of humor, a trifle of contempt.  He learned the value of\r\nplaying with a rhetorical period that he might later leap upon a\r\nclimax.  Frank B. Carvell was periodically egged on to bait the member\r\nof Portage.  He did it well.  I recall once when the member for\r\nCarleton was spluttering vitriolic abuse at the member for Portage that\r\nMeighen muttered, \"Oh, you wait.  I'll get you.\"  Which he\r\ndid--immediately.  Young Cicero had his Catiline.\r\n\r\nOne of Meighen's best speeches now will rank with the best in any\r\ncountry where dignity has not quite deserted the art of parliamentary\r\noration.  But he is rather too fond of picturesque language to make a\r\nreally great speech.  He has a strong intellectual grasp of what he\r\nwants to say and a high moral measure of its significance to the\r\nnation; but for a Premier he is too prone to lapse into the lingo of\r\npartisan debate which in Canada--since the battering days of the giants\r\nthat followed Confederation--has not been on a very high level.\r\nMeighen's best speeches are temperamentally big, but he has yet made no\r\ngreat speech which will live, either in whole or in part, as a\r\nglorification of his country.  It takes a Lincoln or a Roosevelt to be\r\nin high office and say things that palpitate in the heart of a crowd.\r\nWilson did; but he was dangerous.  You judge a man in high office by\r\nwords and deeds.  Lincoln was great in both.  Lloyd George is great in\r\neither, but not always in both at once.  Macdonald could thrill a crowd\r\nwith a homely epigram and turn his hand to a vastly national piece of\r\nwork.  We have yet to be sure that Meighen can be as big in action as\r\nhe has sometimes been in speech.\r\n\r\nUnless one is too easily mistaken, the Imperial Conference imparted a\r\nsteady sense of responsibility to Arthur Meighen that he rather lacked\r\nwhen he took office.  He found himself in a very uncomfortable\r\nspotlight.  He had not been used to measuring his words to suit such\r\nmomentous occasions; nor accustomed to realizing how small the greatest\r\nmen and the most impressive human arrangements are when you get to the\r\ncentre and no longer have the perspective.  He represented the oldest\r\nself-governing Dominion.  A word misplaced might make a vast\r\ndifference.  He realized the significance of the event--especially\r\nbefore an election.  He was never able to keep out of his mind what\r\nmight be happening at home in such places as Medicine Hat.  The issues\r\nwhich he discussed were big.  He handled them worthily, with a due\r\nadmixture of boldness and caution.\r\n\r\nIt was no time for mere sentiment, but for careful deliberation of\r\nmatters that lay beyond Canada, beyond the Empire, in the danger zones\r\nof world politics, more especially of the Orient.  The status of Canada\r\nas a nation north of the United States depended in that case vastly\r\nmore upon a definition of Japanese and Pacific policy than upon any\r\nheroic allusion to the Great War.  No man could have traversed this\r\nprecarious business with more insight into the probable effect of what\r\nhe had to say upon the Empire, the United States, and his own electoral\r\nprospect in Canada.  The day after his announcement of a general\r\nelection this year the Premier spoke to an open-air crowd at the\r\nCanadian National Exhibition.  He chose the Imperial Conference, and\r\nmainly the Pacific issue, as his theme.  In twenty minutes of\r\nunrelieved, almost solemn seriousness, he made that weighty business\r\ninteresting to a crowd not too friendly in politics, with scarcely a\r\ngesture, speaking direct to the people instead of using the amplifier\r\ntube, making himself heard and understood with the clarity of studious\r\nconviction and straight mastery of all the links in his logic.\r\n\r\nAnd Meighen knows how to lead.  His bewildered smile is a prelude often\r\nto a strong move in action.  Older and wiser men learn to love this\r\nlean wildcat who knows the strategic spots in the anatomy of the foe;\r\nwho can spit scorn at the Agrarians and venomous contempt at the\r\nLiberals; who dares to glorify a government of authority and of force\r\nas though it were a democracy; who can hold the allegiance of some\r\nLiberals and lose that of few old Tories.  He has earned that\r\nallegiance.  He carried his load in the war.  Long enough he lay up as\r\nthe handy instrument of a clumsy Coalition, as before that he had been\r\ndog-whip for the Tories.  When Premier Borden wanted a hard job well\r\ndone he gave it to Meighen, who seldom wanted to go to Europe when he\r\ncould be slaving at home.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Meighen he had been but a year in office when\r\nOpportunity came to him with a large blank scroll upon which he might\r\nwrite for the consideration of other people his views about, \"What I\r\nThink of Canada as a Part of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nNo law examiner at Osgoode ever offered him such a chance to say the\r\nright thing wrongly or the wrong thing first.  It was a fascinating\r\ntopic.  Other Premiers had done such things off-hand, almost impromptu\r\nas it seemed, and inspired by merely patriotic sentiment.  This was a\r\nnotice that the Premier of Canada could speak his mind in advance, or\r\nif he so preferred, wait till the Conference of Premiers opened and\r\nspring a surprise.  Meighen lost no time in deciding to prepare for the\r\nN.L.C. party a brief on Imperial relations.  Here was a thing out of\r\nwhich he could make capital--for Canada and the party and the coming\r\nelections.  And if ever Meighen had delved for material he did it now.\r\nHe was going to the Imperial Conference of Premiers with a mandate--to\r\nhelp define Canada's position in the great Commonwealth about which Mr.\r\nLionel Curtis had written two large books and the Round Table had\r\npublished forty-four numbers since 1910; when nobody had as yet issued\r\nthe one clear call for Canada.  Foster, Borden, Rowell--since Laurier\r\nand Macdonald--had all taken a hand in this.  But there was some new\r\nway to state the case that would--or might--seem as large and strong\r\nfor Canada at the Imperial Conference as the voice of either Borden or\r\nRowell had been at the Peace Conference or the Geneva Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Premier could picture Sir Robert scanning his manifesto to the\r\nBritish press; Sir George, his old mentor of speechmaking in the House,\r\ncomparing it to what he used to say for Joe Chamberlain; more clearly\r\nthan all, Mr. Rowell himself, who for two years in the Cabinet had a\r\nmonopoly of that great subject to which he had devoted clear thinking,\r\nconcise language, and some diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe author of \"Polly Masson\" might have drawn from the new Premier on\r\nthis subject some such confessions as are suggested in the following\r\nimaginary, but not improbable interview.\r\n\r\nMr. Meighen, intensely revising his manifesto for the cables looks up\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\"Er--what did you remark?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you were about to say----\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I?  Oh, yes--about the Round Table.  On three legs.  Hasn't even\r\nas much stability as the Canada First minority--most of whom are not in\r\nQuebec.  These are the negligible but uncomfortable extremists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Then you are of the moderate majority?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean I used not to be.  Well, events move fast.  Men change with\r\nthem.  I have been called a Tory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a tariff Tory.\"\r\n\r\n\"A moderately high tariff--sufficient unto the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  But not a tariffite in sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tariffs are not properly sentiment.  They are business.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Joe Chamberlain sentimentalized the tariff.  He was even willing\r\nto have free trade in the Empire to get an Imperial zollverein against\r\nthe rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why mention Chamberlain?  Are you--twitting me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he afterwards wanted an Imperial Cabinet.  And if I'm not\r\nmistaken you began to learn parliamentary speeches from one George\r\nEulas Foster only a few years after he stumped England for the\r\nChamberlain idea.\"\r\n\r\nMeighen smiles; that wan but wholesome illumination of a\r\nthought-harassed face.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't the old flag been some sort of issue in every Federal election\r\nsince Confederation?\" he is asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  No Federal election can be held in this nation, except by\r\nvirtue of the B.N.A. Act, and every election carries with it an\r\ninferential challenge to amend the Act.  Macdonald settled that--by a\r\ngrand compromise with Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--as a Canadian first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted.  But he also said in 1891--mm--now what did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"A British subject I was born----\"\r\n\r\n\"And a British subject I will die.  In his day--well said.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not say that in 1922?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not.  Subjects do not vote in true democracies.  Events\r\nchange men----\"\r\n\r\n\"And parties.  Even Premiers?\"\r\n\r\nHe turns his spindling anatomy about in the chair, suddenly rises and\r\ndarts to a bookshelf, seizes a book and flicks over the pages.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" with a yawn, \"we have now and then to go back to Laurier,\r\nthe biggest if not the greatest autonomist of all Premiers--though Sir\r\nRobert Borden years ago spoke at Peterborough quite as broadly, if less\r\neloquently.  Here it is--spoken during the war by Laurier.  'We are a\r\nfree people, absolutely free.  The charter under which we live has put\r\nit into our power to say whether we should take part in such a war or\r\nnot.  It is for the Canadian people, the Canadian Parliament and the\r\nCanadian Government alone to decide.  This freedom is at once the glory\r\nand the honour of Britain which granted it and of Canada which used it\r\nto assist Britain.  Freedom is the keynote of all British\r\ninstitutions?'\"\r\n\r\nThe clock ticks louder.  It is time to go.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Mr. Meighen, is it not after all the mandate of Canada's part\r\nin the war that stands behind the attitude you are bound to take at\r\nthis Conference?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that if Canada had not gone to war magnificently as she did,\r\nthe war--might have been lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Essentially that.  Hence the new nationhood of Canada born of the war.\r\nYou, or any other leader, even as Tory or as clear Grit, would not\r\nfoist upon this free nation any issue which does not do justice to the\r\nsense of nationhood begotten by the war.  Would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then as to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Canada must be free, because she has a vital interest in the American\r\naspect of such an Alliance that even Britain has not.  This nation is\r\nthe electric transmission transformer between Britain and the United\r\nStates.  There is a Pacific zone of policy in which Canada has a big\r\nstake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.  Now as to the next election?\"\r\n\r\nThe Premier rises: now thinner and more intense than ever.\r\n\r\n\"My friend--just this.  The solidarity of the British Commonwealth\r\nLeague of Nations is at the root of the welfare of the civilized world.\r\nIn every nation of this League, no matter by what party label the\r\nUnionist cause is identified in the baggage room, it is a matter of\r\nvital importance to the solidarity of the League that such party should\r\nremain or go into power.  So--I hope to get from the Conference such a\r\nreasonable endorsation of Canada's stand on the main issues that our\r\nparty here----\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses and gazes fixedly at a large map of Western Canada.  The\r\nvisitor imagines that he is looking at Portage, his home town.\r\n\r\n\"Er--you were saying, Mr. Meighen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Medicine Hat,\" he answered vacantly.  \"Somehow, you know--I wish\r\nKipling had never made that remark about Medicine Hat,--'all hell for a\r\nbasement.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't worry about the Hat just because there's going to be a\r\nbye-election while you're away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--for I know pretty well that I won't hold that seat.  What worries\r\nme is the fool use that some people will make of a freak election as a\r\nforerunner of doom.  However, as I was saying about the Conference--I\r\nhope to get such a reasonable endorsation of Canada's stand on the main\r\nissues that our party here can work to victory advantage in the next\r\nelection.  I may as well be honest.  Arthur Meighen, Premier, has not\r\nyet been elected.  But he intends to be, because he ought to be,\r\nbecause the party he leads can do this country more good for the next\r\nfew years than anything else in sight; because the party which carried\r\nthe war and the re-establishment has been given a new lease of life, at\r\nleast some vision, and a vast deal of experience which Canada is going\r\nto need from now on more than she can ever need the wholesale patent\r\nnostrums of millennial doctors who think the plough-handles are a sign\r\nmanual of a new efficiency in government.  We all know what is\r\nhappening to Russia.  I'll be perfectly frank, and say that I fear this\r\nyoung nation may be induced to scrap experience for experiment--which\r\nabove all times would at present be the inauguration of an economic\r\nsystem for which the nation is not prepared, for which it has not been\r\neducated, and because of which it cannot afford to take for its\r\neducation the bitter experience which too often succeeds glittering\r\nexperiment.  What the world needs to-day is economic justice, not\r\neconomic revolution.  No nation in the world has a better chance than\r\nCanada for sound economic justice to all that makes her the world's\r\nyoung leading democracy.  But economics isn't everything.  Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT GENTLEMAN PREMIER\r\n\r\nRT. HON. SIR ROBERT BORDEN\r\n\r\nHere is a modest, honourable man who saw his duty to the nation and the\r\nemergency never more clearly than he knew his own defects.  Canada\r\nnever before had a mediocrity of such eminence; a man who without a\r\nspark of genius devoted a high talent to a nation's work so well that\r\nhe just about wins a niche in our Valhalla--if we have one.  It was the\r\nwar that almost finished Borden; and it was the war that made him.\r\n\r\nCanada has been governed by strategy, imagination, and common sense.\r\nWe have had Macdonald, Laurier, and Borden.  The first finished his\r\nwork, the second wanted to, and the third had finished his work two\r\nyears before he resigned office.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Borden was the only man in the world Premier both when the\r\nwar began and when it ended.  Of all Premiers of Canada he was the\r\nleast like a Canadian, and he achieved European fame with less title to\r\npersonal greatness than either Laurier or Macdonald.  For the crowd\r\nthere never was an inspired moment in Sir Robert's life, nor ever one\r\nwhen he did not try to do his whole duty.  He never interested the\r\npeople and did not always hold the profound allegiance of his party.\r\nYet there never was a public man in Canada to whom the average\r\npolitician would as soon take off his hat in absolute respect for his\r\nmoral purpose, integrity, fair-mindedness and sense of honour.  There\r\nwas enough morality wasted in the equipment of R. L. Borden to have\r\nsupplied the lack of it in some of his heterogeneous followers.  But it\r\nwas morality that he could not transmit except by silent influence.\r\n\r\nOther celebrated Premiers had governed by the personal method.  The\r\nmoral law was written all over Borden.  He was a walking decalogue.  He\r\nworked for the good of the country without detriment to the\r\nConservative party.  But there never was any Borden Mount of\r\nTransfiguration.  He never could lead except when he was considered by\r\nthe Majority to be right.  In the war he took refuge in the nation, and\r\nits patriotism.  But for the war one doubts that Sir Robert would ever\r\nhave won any title to fame.\r\n\r\nThe man's whole makeup is a sort of righteousness.  He had no use for\r\nthe mirror more than to adjust his necktie and his hair, of which a\r\nwoman writer said:\r\n\r\n\"That wonderful hair of his must have brought the unctuous fingers of\r\nmany masters, spiritual and otherwise, down upon it in commendatory\r\npats. . . .  I daresay that it was his mother's pleasure in it and the\r\nway she enjoyed running her fingers through it that made him\r\nrealize--subconsciously at least--that his hair was a very magnificent\r\nasset.\"  The writer also described the garden of the Premier--his\r\nwonderful roses; how he talked about the personalities of the wild\r\nflowers so dear to his soul, and the perversities of the wild\r\ncucumber--but amiably declined to say a word about the destinies of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nLaurier had his flute.  Borden should not be denied his wild garden.  I\r\nused to think, watching the Premier in the House, that he would make a\r\nsplendid bronze bust of an Egyptian god.\r\n\r\nBut the man never could dress for the part of leader.  He needed too\r\nmuch grooming.  He must always be immaculate.  A trifle of neglige\r\nwould have ruined his career.\r\n\r\nWe never heard of his \"iron hand within the velvet glove.\"  He had\r\nneither the hand nor the glove.  He was an influence; never a power.\r\nEven when the stage was all set for a show Sir Robert could not take\r\nthe spot-light.  He did not abhor the calcium; he merely did not know\r\nwhat to do when it was on.  During the tour which preceded the\r\ntriumphal election of 1911 he was strong enough to win the country and\r\nweak enough to pose for oratorical photographs of Sir Robert swaying a\r\ncrowd--on the roof of a Toronto hotel.  Those photographs were\r\npublished as authentic pictures of the Premier in action.\r\n\r\nBut real action seldom happened to Premier Borden.  He never could\r\ninvent occasions.  He had no craft to play the game, no intuition to\r\npenetrate into the conscience of a lukewarm supporter or of a man whose\r\npolicies and programmes might bedevil the union of the party.  On his\r\ntour in 1915 when, after seeing and hearing more of the realism of war\r\nthan any other man in the country, he undertook to translate his\r\nemotions to crowds of people here, he was compelled to use the\r\ntomtom-on-the-Midway performances of R. B. Bennett, at a time when\r\ndominating men of both parties put their political makeups into their\r\npockets in order to do honour to the tragic cause of which on behalf of\r\nthe nation he was the spokesman.\r\n\r\nPolitical history is very largely a chronicle of stupendous noises, of\r\npageants and tumults and shoutings, of strategies and manoeuvres,\r\nsecret conclaves and cabals, of sinister intrigues and specious\r\nplatitudes in parliament to cover them up, and of occasional great\r\nepisodes when the leader feels called to vindicate himself and his\r\nfollowers.  Most of these emotional experiences seem to have been\r\ndenied to Sir Robert.\r\n\r\nI daresay it was mainly his lack of imagination.  Borden must, \"work\r\nfor the night is coming.\"  The day's work was often bigger than the man.\r\n\r\nHis advent to the leadership was a moral makeshift.  His defeat of\r\nLaurier in 1911 was not a triumph for anything that might be called\r\nBordenism.  His conduct of the political side of the war was\r\ncreditable, at times splendid, never consummately wise, never heroic.\r\nHis exit was as uneventful as his advent.  Sir Robert had more than\r\nfinished his work.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative party as such carries no indelible imprint from the\r\nman who for nearly a quarter of a century led it.  He led it by going\r\nalongside.  He was not a great partisan.  He had no overwhelming and\r\naudacious bigotries.\r\n\r\nBorden was the first Conservative leader of note who never could play\r\nthe ace of Quebec.  The Laurier Cabinet knew how to play politics by\r\nimagination.  Borden had nothing but a demoralized remnant, which the\r\nLiberals pillaged when they discarded Free Trade, helped themselves to\r\na high, virtually protective, tariff for revenue only, took a reef out\r\nof the Tory \"old flag\" monopoly by establishing the British Preference\r\nand sent a contingent to the South African War in the name of Empire.\r\nLaurier was master in Quebec, in the new West whose two new Provinces\r\nhe created, in immigration, in great railways, in a deeper St.\r\nLawrence, in flamboyant adventures with great harbours, in the Quebec\r\nBridge.  Borden as yet was master of nothing.  Such brilliance and\r\nsuccess had never been confronted by such a demoralized party and so\r\nmuch drab common sense in a leader.\r\n\r\nSir Robert's Premiership was a desperate inheritance.  The direct\r\nplunge into the Naval Aid Bill was a badly staged attempt to capitalize\r\nthe reaction against restricted reciprocity.  That first session of the\r\nBorden Parliament goes on record as the most complete one-act farce\r\never inflicted upon a patient country.  The Imperial issue was a play\r\nto the gallery, and it is the one clear issue that seems to remain of\r\nall the Borden idea.\r\n\r\nSir Robert in his whole life never constructed an epigram.  His two\r\ngreat predecessors had made several.  Epigrams sometimes outlive\r\npolicies.  He never delivered a great passionate speech.  He had\r\nopportunities but could not meet them.  Fine speeches enough, to be\r\nsure; many of them instinct with a sort of ethical nobility; but a\r\ngreat palpitating speech, never.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that if left to the logic of ordinary evolution Sir\r\nRobert ever would have recreated his party even on Imperial issues; or\r\nconvinced the West that Conservatism was not merely anti-agrarian; or\r\nshewn Quebec that Conservatives in the second decade of the twentieth\r\ncentury are better Laurentians than the Liberals by preserving better\r\nthe anti-continental idea.  Such things call for leadership by\r\nimagination and a Cabinet of strong men.  Sir Robert had neither.  Even\r\nin the House he was not the party leader.  Conservatism established by\r\nMacdonald as a great system of damnation to the Grits, was on the low\r\nroad to extinction.  It was not in the power of Robert Borden to save\r\nit.  The country was swept by a new Liberalism that by astute\r\nmanipulation had kept sympathetic both manufacturers and radicals.\r\n\r\nLong before the war came, Canada recognized in Mr. Borden a Premier who\r\nknew the meaning of moral caution so well that he knew not boldness at\r\nall except that his cause was right.  Borden had the ethical stolidity\r\nof Asquith without the latter's personal weaknesses or his powers of\r\noratory.  He needed somebody with him as stage manager and makeup\r\nartist.  Even his virtues might have been advertised with\r\neffect--though as a rule, except in characters like Lincoln, it takes\r\nthe perspective of time to put those into a poster.  So eminently\r\nrespectable; so high in honour; so fair in judgment; so irresolute in\r\naction; so defective in imagination; so content to be overshadowed by\r\nlesser men in his own party even though he never was intimidated by\r\nbigger men in the Opposition: such, so far as we could see him before\r\nthe war, was Sir Robert Borden.\r\n\r\nPlatitudes lay in wait for the Premier to utter them.  Only by an\r\neffort of will could he lift them to a plane of high interest.  He\r\ncould sketch great issues with the solemn hand of a great preacher\r\npronouncing a benediction; but he never could utter an aside, or crack\r\na joke, or tell a story, or forget that once upon a time Fate had\r\npicked him to be a leader and so help him he would go through the\r\nmotions of shepherding while the other men were the real collie dogs of\r\nthe flock.  If only Borden could have broken some bucking broncho, or\r\nworn some new kind of bouquet, or invented some imitation of a brazen\r\nserpent to hold up, the people and the party might have got hold of him\r\nand followed him.\r\n\r\nSuch was Premier Borden before the war, and so he remained, but under a\r\nmagnifying glass, afterwards.  The war was a godsend to the Government.\r\nIt drove out alleged dissension in the Cabinet and gave the party which\r\nhad met defeat in the Naval Aid Bill a chance to perpetrate something\r\nwhich no Parliament would dare try to defeat.  Sometimes I almost think\r\nBorden was for short periods in the war a truly great man--in the eyes\r\nof the angels.  He had known the war was coming; he had said so.  There\r\nwas a secret plan of action on file in the Archives months before it\r\ncame.  Not his to exult in I-told-you-sos to the leader opposite who\r\nhad mitigated the menace.  He rose to his programme of duty.  He did\r\nnot even wait till Britain declared war, but cabled assurances of aid\r\non August 2nd, 1914.  Special Parliament was assembled.  The hour had\r\nstruck.  A Halifax writer present at the Khaki Parliament says:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Wilfrid easily bore off the honours in oratory.  It was a great\r\noccasion and he rose to it. . . .  Sir Robert is no orator, but he\r\nspoke in straight man-fashion of the great crisis.  The climax of his\r\nspeech was a solemn warning of the dark days to come 'when our\r\nendurance will be tried.'\"\r\n\r\nHad the Premier issued a referendum in that first month of Canada's\r\ngoing to war he would have wept at the amazing number of Noes from the\r\nProvince in which Laurier was born, and the provinces in the Far West\r\nwhich he had created; in the one, obvious indifference whatever the\r\ncause; in the other enmity from the Nationals whom Laurier had imported\r\nto make Liberal voters.  Even in the rural areas, traditionally the\r\nstronghold of Liberalism, indifferentism was the rule; and in the city\r\nof Kitchener where Laurier had politically baptized Mackenzie King, his\r\nsuccessor, there was almost a state of civil war.\r\n\r\nBut the fervour of the Hughes programme prevented the Premier from\r\ntaking stock of the nation.  He permitted Hughes to treat Quebec as an\r\nautomatic part of Canada at war--which it was not; and he failed to use\r\neven the Machiavellian energies of Bob Rogers in getting a line on the\r\npsychology of the West, supposed to be useful only in elections.  Sir\r\nRobert had long known of the menace of Germany, and his Naval Aid Bill\r\nwas one proof that he knew.  But he did not understand the menace of\r\ndisunited Canada.  There never was in Ottawa any informing vision of\r\nCanada at war.  Canada, in fact, was not at war.  Political feuds were\r\nindeed forgotten; thanks to a noble-minded Premier that was natural\r\nenough.  But had there been a national poet then big enough to\r\ntranslate into great verse the true spiritual state of Canada, he would\r\nhave written with poignant sadness about Quebec; perhaps a few verses\r\non the overwhelming British-born majority in the First Contingent.  He\r\nwould have explained that being a native son of Canada, whether you\r\nwere English or French by extraction, did not of itself lead to\r\nenlistment in the ranks.  The Premier should have known whether Sam\r\nHughes was awarding patronage by making officers from the Conservative\r\nparty or whether according to his own statement he was doing just the\r\nopposite.  In fact it was the Premier's business to see that the\r\nMinister of War pursued neither policy.\r\n\r\nBut with the Hughes flares all about him it was hard for the Premier to\r\nsee the nation; most of all Quebec.  In this matter of the two Canadas,\r\nSam Hughes saw his opportune duty and he did it.  Sir Robert saw his\r\nand shrank from it, not weakly but blindly.  Quebec should have been\r\nthe instant objective of all the wisdom in Canada's Cabinet.  Except\r\nfor one or two grand battalions and a minority of broad-minded\r\nFrench-Canadians, Quebec was not at war, as part of united Canada.\r\nBanging the drum and blowing the bugle in Quebec was as wrong in\r\nstrategy as to send Bob Rogers down to exorcise, as he did in 1915, the\r\nphantom of conscription.  Sir Robert knew that even in civil times his\r\nGovernment was electorally ignored on the St. Lawrence.  How much more\r\nin a time of unpopular war?  Was it not clear that every hurrah for the\r\nEmpire in Ontario, every fresh battalion mustered and drilled in\r\nToronto, every troopship down the St. Lawrence, was a nail in the\r\ncoffin of Quebec's potentiality in the war?\r\n\r\nYes, Sir Robert Borden knew that.  He knew that Laurier was sulking\r\nlike Cassius in his tent; that he was gnawing himself over the failure\r\nof his own predictions about the peace welfare of the world as well as\r\nfor his own defeat in the election of 1911; that the man of the \"sunny\r\nways\" was becoming a reactionary and a cynic, an old leader of great\r\npower, which he was willing to use to the utmost for the prosecution of\r\nthe war had he been in office, but in opposition was manacled by a\r\nsense of futility against forces in Quebec which he understood and\r\nfeared far more than did the Premier.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Premier traversed all this, many a time and in great\r\nconcern.  And it may be that he saw so sharply into the sad\r\nhopelessness of it all that he decided not to ask Laurier for advice,\r\nor even suggestion.  Such is lack of imagination.\r\n\r\nLaurier had his day in the grand expansion of the country.  Borden\r\nwould have his, in the sacrifices and moral energies of the dark days\r\nto come.  It was a greater thing to be Premier in war than ever it had\r\nbeen in peace.  Canada was a greater land in action on the West front\r\nthan ever she had been stringing railways, settling farms and building\r\ntowns on the frontiers.  The more Canada went to the front of her own\r\nfree will, the greater she seemed abroad.  The credit of this nation at\r\nwar went up in London and Paris much faster than its investment credit\r\nhad ever gone on the exchanges.  The further one got from Ottawa the\r\ngreater the country seemed.  A Canadian Cabinet Minister meeting a\r\nBritish Minister in London could talk for an hour on the wonderful war\r\ncharacter of this country.  London was the centre of gravity of the\r\nwest front, and of Canadian Ministers.  The Premier spent almost half\r\nhis time in or near London, whenever summoned, or whenever politic to\r\ngo--to a place where the rancours of Ottawa were all buried in the\r\ngrand cause.  The Premier of Canada sometimes went to London when he\r\nwould rather have stayed at home; more often when he felt that it was\r\nemotionally bigger to be Premier in London than in Ottawa.  He was more\r\nhonoured in war than Laurier had been in peace.  He would have been a\r\nbetter Canadian had he stayed in Ottawa more.  But there were many\r\nCanadians who were more concerned about how to help Foch and Lloyd\r\nGeorge win the war in Europe than about how to knuckle down to common\r\nbusiness at home.  The trek to England and to Europe became a fad.  The\r\nnations went world crazy.  Premiers neglected to \"saw wood.\"  It was a\r\nmatter for gratitude that they did not parade in khaki.\r\n\r\nPremier Borden's lingering objection to Coalition here, even after it\r\nwas established in London, did him no credit.  He was displeased when\r\nthe Chairman of the Imperial Munitions Board, back from a business\r\nconference in London, asked if the Premier had any objection to his\r\nstating the case for the need of Coalition at a public dinner.  Of\r\ncourse the Chairman was out of order.  But he was talking business, not\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe war was not going well.  The British part of it was badly enough\r\nbedevilled by distance and differences of opinion between various\r\nDominions without the distraction of party politics.\r\n\r\nBut for the great services of win-the-war Liberals the Military Service\r\nAct might have disrupted the Coalition even when it came.  It was an\r\nextreme measure; much more hazardous here than in Britain--except for\r\nIreland, of which we wanted no imitation in Quebec.  There were times\r\nwhen Sir Robert longed for the wings of a dove.  His offer of Coalition\r\ncame at a time when he knew Laurier would refuse it.  Conscription he\r\ncarried out as a necessity.  He never wanted it.  No Premier of a\r\nfree-will nation would.  There were bigoted anti-Quebeckers who would\r\nhave had compulsion from the first to show the French that Canada was\r\ngreater than Quebec.  But if Canada had sent conscripts in 1915 what\r\nwould have become of the glory of the Canadian army?  The argument that\r\nit was the best men who were killed, thereby robbing the nation of its\r\nflower, is thoroughly ignoble.  Canada has never regretted that her\r\nbest men died first, or that the Premier delayed conscription until it\r\nwas inevitable.  Canada does regret that the Government did not until\r\ntoo late, attempt to make any national register of the strength of this\r\nnation as had been done in England before conscription came as the\r\nfinal result.  To have applied conscription before the United States\r\nwent to war would have driven thousands of slackers across the border.\r\nEnough went as it was in the fear that conscription was coming.\r\n\r\nThe bilingual bungle in the Commons was even worse than the bad feeling\r\nover conscription.  In this debate the angry French element in the\r\nHouse were a bad commentary on the still hopeful minority of\r\nbroadminded French-Canadians who wanted to carry on the honour of\r\nCourcellette.  The controversy over titles was no feather in the cap of\r\nthe Premier, who made a bad fist of defending a practice the most\r\nglaring instance of which was the creation of hereditary titles in a\r\ndemocratic country.\r\n\r\nCanada's \"dark days\" were fast coming.  The resignation of Hughes was\r\ndue before it came.  The Premier's patience was scarcely any longer a\r\nvirtue in this case, when four months after the declaration of war he\r\nhad been compelled to make a diplomatic visit to Toronto's war camp in\r\norder to smooth out the troubles created by his \"Chief of Staff.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time on to the end of his career we had the spectacle of a\r\nPremier overburdened and weary in his office, bewildered by the\r\ninsistent advices of other men and sad over the failure of even\r\nconscription, in the face of such wastage, to get Canada's 5th Division\r\ninto the field without weakening the four divisions we had.  The Union\r\nGovernment was too heavy a load for so weary a man to carry.  It had\r\ndone its work, most of it well, some of it too late.  The head of it\r\nwas worn out.  He was away much for his health, more for service in\r\nEurope, coming back to reconstruct his Cabinet, with the aid of\r\nMeighen, then away again.  He had lost Hughes, Rogers, Crerar, Cochrane.\r\n\r\nThe strong men he had left, except Meighen, White and Foster, were\r\nUnion Liberals.\r\n\r\nWhy did the Premier not himself resign?  His work was done.  His Union\r\nGovernment had finished the work which the nation gave it a mandate to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe answer must be in Sir Robert's own conviction that as a Premier of\r\nCanada he still had a great work to do in Europe in the settlement of\r\npeace.  That work he did, some of it much more ably than much he had\r\ndone at home.  We had to read the headlines diligently to see where\r\nnext Canada's mobile Premier would be needed in the adjustments of\r\npeace.  More of the answer might be found in the doubt as to whether\r\nany man in Canada clearly knew what the Government's work, and\r\ntherefore its mandate, would be.  It was a time of upheavals when any\r\nnation with a Government carrying on its work constructively according\r\nto programme might have been glad to escape the further upheaval of a\r\ngeneral election.  But political parties have usually been profiteers\r\nin the emergency of a nation.  Did the Premier fear that his\r\nresignation would force an election before the new party was ready?  We\r\nare not told.  Under pressure he called a caucus in 1919 to determine\r\nthe programme of whatever party he had in the Union.  The caucus\r\ndetermined nothing.  Did he hope to carry on until the legal expiry of\r\nhis term in 1922, thereby evening up with the Liberals who wanted to\r\nbring on an election in 1916?\r\n\r\nThis also we do not know.  Sir Robert was a weary and baffled Premier.\r\nHe did not know how to let go.  Once even his faltering hand was off,\r\nwho was to succeed him?  There were three men to consider.\r\n\r\nThe man's work was done.  He knew it.  Much of it had been nobly done.\r\nHe knew that the nation was sure of this.  And he now understands that\r\neven with the failures and the weaknesses of his administration, both\r\nas Conservative and Unionist Premier, we cordially concede to this high\r\nmediocrity a place in our critical affairs only second to the credit\r\nthat he gained in England and in Europe as the head of a nation that\r\nhad gloriously fought and magnificently won--in the war.\r\n\r\nCanada never had as great and noble a servant, who failed so\r\nconspicuously on personal grounds to be the nation's master.  But there\r\nwere elements in the patriotic servant-hood of R. L. Borden, higher\r\nthan the political masteries of more brilliant men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA POLITICAL SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\nRT. HON. SIR WILFRID LAURIER\r\n\r\nFifty years from now some Canadian Drinkwater, charmed by the eloquent\r\nperspectives of time, may write an \"Abraham Lincoln\" string of personal\r\nscenes from the lives of Wilfrid Laurier and John A. Macdonald.  The\r\nnarrative will thus begin in the very year that the story of Lincoln\r\nends, and it will carry on down just fifty years in our national\r\nhistory to the time when Wilfrid Laurier, passionate student of the\r\nCivil War, reached the end of his climax in the affairs of Canada and\r\nthe Empire.  But the poet who does this must be inspired; because no\r\nyoung country at that period of time in the world had had two such\r\nremarkable men as contemporaries, and political foes, and lucky is the\r\nnation which at any period has such a man as Laurier.\r\n\r\nOutwardly Laurier's political career was complex where Macdonald's was\r\nsimple.  John A. was as great a Canadian as Laurier; but in the simpler\r\ntimes in which he lived he had less cause to be puzzled by the web of\r\nfate and of political cross-currents at home and abroad, even though he\r\nwas immensely more baffled by politicians and party emergencies.\r\n\r\nLaurier swung in a great romantic orbit of political sentiment, vaster\r\nthan that of any other statesman we ever had.  For the fifteen years up\r\ntill about 1906, he seemed like the greatest man ever born a citizen of\r\nCanada.  Before that period he was a romance.  After it he was a\r\nnational hallucination.  The last three years of his life he was a\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nYet the tragedy kept on smiling.  Half a century of smiles.  We never\r\nhad a statesman who could smile so potently.  Never one with such\r\nmellifluous music in his voice, such easy grace in his style, such a\r\ncardinal's hauteur when he wanted to be alone, and such a fascinating\r\nurbanity when he wanted to impress a company, a caucus or a crowd.  The\r\nRomist whom Orangemen admired, the Frenchman who made an intellectual\r\nhobby of British democracy, the poetic statesman who read Dickens and\r\nre-read in two languages Uncle Tom's Cabin and sometimes played the\r\nflute, and the Premier of a bilingual country who had a passion for the\r\nstudy of the war which emancipated the negro, was the kaleidoscopic\r\nenigma of Canadian public life.\r\n\r\nLaurier was nearly all things to all men.  He was sometimes many things\r\nto himself.  He idolized himself and laughed at himself.  He venerated\r\nBritish institutions and passionately loved Quebec.  He came to his\r\nflowering period in a party of Free Trade and went to seed in a party\r\ncommitted to a species of protection.  He spoke English as fluently as\r\nBach wrote fugues, and with more passion and beauty of utterance than\r\nany of our English-Canadian orators.  One moment he could be as\r\ndebonair as Beau Brummel, the next as forbidding and repellent as a\r\nmodern Caesar.  He was consistently the best-dressed public man in\r\nCanada.  A misfitting coat to him was as grievous as a misplaced verb\r\nin a peroration.  He superficially loved many things.  Life was to him,\r\neven apart from politics, a gracious delight.  He knew how to pose, to\r\nfeign affability and to be sincere.  With more culture Laurier would\r\nhave been the most exquisite dilettante of his age.  But he cared\r\nlittle for poetry in verse, not much for fine music, had small taste\r\nfor _objets d'art_ or the precious in anything.  His greatest affection\r\nwas in his home, his greatest charm in fine manners, his master passion\r\nin speech, and in managing Cabinets to win elections for the party\r\nwhich to him meant a greater and more inspiring Canada.  We have had\r\nbetter debaters; but never a man except himself who in the House could\r\nmake a sort of grand music out of an apologetic oration on National\r\nTranscontinental grades.\r\n\r\nA writer who at various periods of time was very intimate with Laurier\r\nthinks he was a man of deep emotions.  This may be doubted.  A man who\r\ntalked so easily and was so exquisitely conscious of himself could\r\nscarcely be considered spiritually profound.  Other men and events\r\nplayed upon him like the wind on an Aeolian harp.  He was tremendously\r\nimpressionable; and by turns grandly impressive.  A personal friend\r\nrelates how a man with some experience as a critic of drama--probably\r\nhimself--went to see Laurier by request for a talk on the political\r\nsituation; how Laurier invited him to a chair and immediately took one\r\nbeside him an inch or two lower so that his own face was on a level\r\nwith the visitor's; how for some minutes he sat feeling the power of\r\nthis actor who tried to persuade him to run as a Liberal candidate, and\r\nwhen he rose again seemed taller and more aloof than ever.\r\n\r\nThat is acting.  Some other man might have done the same thing and made\r\nno impression.  Laurier could perform obvious tricks with a consummate\r\ngrace.  And he performed many.  There never was a moment of his waking\r\nlife when he could not have been lifted into a play.  His movements,\r\nhis words, his accent, his clothes, his facial lineaments were never\r\ncommonplace, even when his motives often may have been.  He was\r\nDebussy's Afternoon of a Faun; poetry and charm all the days of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDuring the ridiculous deadlock on the Naval Aid Bill, when his\r\nsupporters went so grotesquely far as to read the Bible to talk out the\r\nBill, he was away from the House for a week, reported as quite ill, in\r\nreality having a very delicious time at home reading light literature.\r\nThe day he came back the news of his coming was heralded to the\r\nCommons.  The benches were packed.  Not till they were all full, every\r\nMinister in his place, every page at attention and the House like a\r\npent-up Sabbath congregation, did the then leader of the Opposition\r\nmake his grand, swift entry, bowing with courtly dignity to the Speaker\r\nand taking his seat amid a claque from his supporters, in which even\r\nthe Tories felt like joining.\r\n\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier had the infallible knack of adjusting his makeup,\r\nnot always himself--to any occasion from which he could extract\r\nprofitable publicity, or upon which he could do some charming thing for\r\nsomebody else.  He is reputed once to have worn overalls among a gang\r\nof timber-jammers, but he felt rather ridiculous and soon took them\r\noff.  Interviewed abed in his private car at a railway station by a\r\npolitical friend, he suddenly became conscious of his pyjamas and\r\nrolled back into the bedclothes with a smile.  He was not happy in\r\n_deshabille_.  Entertained at an arts luncheon in 1913, he made the\r\nmost of a very Spartan meal, consented with much dignity to exchange\r\nhis plate of cold beef for another man's cold mutton, listened with\r\ngreat gravity to a short programme of music, asked the names of the\r\ncomposers and the players and spent most of his brief speech denying\r\nthat he was anything but a philistine in art, and pledging himself if\r\never he was Premier again to do more for Canadian art than had ever\r\nbeen done before.  In conversation at a friend's house with a stranger\r\nhe claimed that at college he was always a \"lazy dog.\"  Visited once by\r\nan agent who tried to sell him a phonograph, he consented to play the\r\nflute for a record; after listening to the record and being assured\r\nthat it was a faithful replica of his own performance and asked if now\r\nhe would not buy the machine, he answered gravely, \"No, I think I will\r\nsell the flute.\"  This story may be apocryphal, but it is delightfully\r\ntrue to character.\r\n\r\nOn one of the thousands of \"occasions\" in a career that was almost\r\nperpetual drama he was buttonholed in his office by an American\r\nreporter who, having been warned that the Premier of Canada never gave\r\ninterviews, boasted that he would break the rule.  After half an hour\r\nthe American reporter came out to his confreres of the press gallery,\r\nsat down at a typewriter, lighted three or four cigarettes, nervously\r\naware that he was being watched for the forthcoming article, and after\r\nspoiling a number of sheets and tearing them all up he confessed,\r\n\"Well, boys, I thought I was pumping Laurier, but it's a cinch he spent\r\nmost of my time pumping me.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Liberal press gallery men he was as much a captain as he was to\r\nhis followers in the House.  He gave them daily audience during the\r\nSession, very often in a group, and at such times he usually asked,\r\n\"Well, boys, what's the news?\"  He wanted good news; and many a\r\nreporter tricked up the truth now and then to give it to him.  Informed\r\nonce that \"Bob\" Rogers had vehemently in his office denied any cabal in\r\nthe Cabinet against the Premier he swiftly replied, with that splendid,\r\nsatirical smile, \"Well, the fact that Bob Rogers says there is none\r\nwould convince me that there probably is.\"\r\n\r\nLaurier was the kind of man to whom other people naturally happened.\r\nHe was a human solar system in which many kinds of people wanted to\r\ngravitate, even to the ragged little girl on the prairie who picked him\r\nthe wild flowers that he wore in his coat as far as she could see him\r\non the train platform.  He discovered early in life that he could\r\ninterest other people much as some men find out they can juggle or\r\nsing.  It was a fatal gift.  Laurier was far too long in this country,\r\nmuch too interesting.  Women in Ottawa could make delirious\r\nconversation out of how this man at 72 got into a taxi.  He was more\r\nphenomenal to English than to French.  He never cultivated Paris and\r\nwould not have been at home there.  At Imperial Conferences and\r\nCoronations he was an Imperial matinee idol in London.  In Ontario he\r\nwas regarded with much the same awe as the small boy views the\r\nlong-haired medicine man.  To the Quebecker he was the grand magic;\r\nuntil Bourassa came, irresistible, incomparable on stage.  But Laurier\r\nhad no great intensity; no Savonarola gift to sway a crowd; he just\r\ncharmed them; when they came to remember his song--what was it?\r\nEarlier in life he was a sort of Ulysses, led by magic.  He loved the\r\n_petit ville_ of Lin where he was born.  But it was too small for him.\r\nHe was lured into studies, to college, to the bilingual university\r\nMcGill, to law, to discourse with learned Anglo-Saxons, to the study of\r\nBritish Government by democracy, to the translation of himself into\r\nEnglish.  The translation, which was almost a masterpiece, made him the\r\nfirst and perhaps the last French Premier of Canada, and in many\r\nrespects the greatest Premier we ever had.\r\n\r\nThis alone was something.  Speaking their own tongue, Laurier could\r\nimpress the English.  He could tour Ontario and feel grandly at home in\r\nthe Liberal shires, among the men of the Maple Leaf.  He could follow\r\none of his two transcontinentals up the Saskatchewan, and to multitudes\r\nof many nations led from Europe by his own immigration policy conduct a\r\nPentecost for the two new Provinces.  He could fling magic over\r\nManitoba, and on the Pacific he had power.  But in Nova Scotia he could\r\nnever equal the memory of Joseph Howe, a greater orator than Laurier.\r\n\r\nWhat this man's sensations were as he studied himself in the art of\r\npolitics may be compared to what an English Canadian of similar\r\ntemperament would feel like if he could fling a spell over Quebec.\r\nLaurier made a second conquest of Canada.  He took a great Cobden party\r\nfrom Edward Blake and made it almost protectionist, Imperial and his\r\nown.  He grafted a sort of Liberalism on to polyglot nationalities.  In\r\nabout the same tenure of power he created a personal ascendancy the\r\nequal of Macdonald's, in a nation almost twice as big and much more\r\ncomplex.  In ten years he changed the face of Canada as no Premier had\r\never done before or ever can do again.  He was looked at in Imperial\r\nLondon as though he were the joint picturesque descendant of Wolfe and\r\nMontcalm, with a mandate to make Canadian Liberalism an instrument of\r\nEmpire, a bi-racial Government a final proof of the eternal wisdom of\r\nthe British North America Act, and a measure of reciprocity a safeguard\r\nof Anglo-American entente.\r\n\r\nSo the son of the village surveyor from the tin-spired parish of St.\r\nLin had made himself very nearly monarch of all he surveyed, with the\r\nnotion that his right there was none to dispute.  Sprung from the most\r\nbackward province in Confederation, he pushed Canada forward with\r\nhectic speed, not counting the cost, nor caring what the end might be,\r\nso long as he died Premier of a prosperous nation and therefore happy.\r\n\r\nAt about the age of sixty a reaction came over Laurier; first\r\nnoticeable in less enthusiasm and more reticence at the Imperial\r\nConferences.  The French-Canadian who had lost a segment of his\r\nidolatrous following in Quebec because of clashes with the clergy and\r\nthe sending of a contingent to the South African War, began to resist\r\nthe cold machinations of the Chamberlain group.  He began to see\r\nEmpire, not as a commonwealth of democracies, but as domination from\r\nDowning Street.  At home he was shrewd to observe that the Canada of\r\nhis own domination was a complex of many \"nationals,\" only a few of\r\nwhich were historically rooted in the Anglo-Saxon idea.  He saw that\r\nthe bigger half of this Canada was arising in the West, which he\r\nbelieved he had truly because politically created; and the West had but\r\na slender minority of people to whom the Maple Leaf meant anything.\r\n\r\nIf the party which he also had recreated into a Laurier Liberal party\r\nwas to continue dominating Canada until white-plumed Laurier had\r\nfinished his work, it must be by a stronger leverage than Imperialism.\r\nHe had managed to hold Quebec, which now thanks to himself and Lomer\r\nGouin, was almost solidly Liberal.  The prairie farmers he must not\r\nlose.  And the grain growers were not keen about an England which\r\nbought their wheat at open world prices in competition with cheap wheat\r\ncountries like Russia, and their cattle at prices dictated by the\r\nArgentine; when both cattle and wheat were cheapened to the producer by\r\nthe long-haul railways which Laurier and the Tories had built.\r\n\r\nAnd although the \"Old Man\" had scant knowledge of business, he had the\r\nwisdom of the serpent to translate the signs of the times; yet lacking\r\nsomehow the vision to foresee that a play for the western vote by a\r\nmeasure of reciprocity would resolve itself into a boomerang at the\r\npolls.  Laurier had a wonderful Canadian vision.  In 1904 he refused a\r\nLiberal M.P. from the Pacific Federal interference in the Oriental\r\nproblem, saying, \"The day will come when we shall be glad of Japanese\r\nwarships on our Pacific coast.\"  Yet in 1912, in a letter to a friend,\r\nhe gravely minimized the German menace.  He understood America and Asia\r\nbetter than Europe.  His vision was keener in power than in defeat.\r\n\r\nAnd then the war, which in a few strokes finished the almost complete\r\npicture of Laurier.  His support of the Government in going to the aid\r\nof Britain was at first a flash of the old generously impulsive Laurier\r\nwho loved England.  That love he never lost.  He expressed it in the\r\nHouse down near to the end of the war.  He loved England a thousand\r\ntimes better than some Englishmen do.  For the Empire it is doubtful if\r\nhe was ever profoundly enthusiastic except as he saw in it the glorious\r\nevolution of self-governing democracies such as Canada, his first love.\r\nHe understood this country.  It is not remarkable that he did.  Any\r\npublic man of Canada should.  But Laurier's love for his own country\r\nwas of an especially intense character, because it was for a long while\r\nso deeply romantic.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older the original veneration he had for England as the\r\nmother of democracy was more and more transferred to Canada as an\r\nexperiment in that form of government.  The more he won elections, the\r\ngreater grew his passion for democracy and for interpreting his native\r\nland.  The pity is that a man cannot go on winning and losing elections\r\nwithout suffering some damage to his clear love of country.  The\r\nhighest patriot is he who knows best how to lose himself and his\r\nelection, all but his conscience and his cause, for the sake of the\r\nland he loves.  Laurier did not remain till the end of his life the\r\nhighest patriot.  Weary as he is said to have been of public life as\r\nfar back as 1905, he was lured into winning more elections by the\r\nadulation of his followers and his own love of swaying men as a master,\r\nuntil elections with him became a habit and the loss of one a tragedy.\r\n\r\nAnd even the war which shook so many men's love of country to the\r\ndepths--some of them over the precipice of profits, others to the\r\npassionate heights of sacrifice--did not obliterate in Laurier the\r\nfatal desire to win elections.  One has almost to cease thinking to\r\nremember that Wilfrid Laurier did hope that an election would yet be\r\nheld during the war that would return him to power.  The failure of the\r\nGovernment in the war would be largely the fault of Quebec which he\r\nstill in large measure controlled.  He held that ace.  And when the\r\ntime came he would play it.  The Premier wanted no advice from him.\r\nLaurier offered him none.\r\n\r\nWhen the bilingual dispute was transferred to the Commons, Laurier took\r\nthe only side consistent with his character and his career.  He avowed\r\nhis belief, as always, in Provincial rights, but he asked Ontario to\r\nuse its strength with clemency.  Even with an element of bitterness he\r\ndid not lose his dignity.  But the fine sparkle of the Laurier we all\r\nknew was gone.  He was beset with complexities and contradictions.  The\r\none simple thing about him was his hope to finish his work by winning\r\nanother election.  In the debate on the Nickle motion for the abolition\r\nof any further king-made aristocracy in Canada, he was an acidulous old\r\ncynic, offering to go and burn his title in the market place if certain\r\nothers would do likewise.  Those photographs of Laurier in the Windsor\r\nUniform, making him look like a refulgent relique of the court of Louis\r\nXIV. were no longer prized in the family album.  Away with them!\r\n\r\nPoor, splendid old man!  Even in his crotchets and quavers he was\r\ncharming.  To the very last he could rise in the Commons and with a\r\nvoice as thick as wool make members opposite fancy they were hearing\r\ngreat music.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 an artist painted a portrait of Laurier to hang in the\r\nLegislative halls of Quebec, where the sound of his magic voice had\r\nfirst been heard in parliamentary speech.  The artist began to paint\r\nthe Laurier of \"the sunny ways.\"  The old man corrected him.  \"No, if\r\nyou please,\" he said gravely, \"paint me as a ruler of men.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Cardinal speaking; the man who had disciplined more Cabinet\r\npoliticians than even Macdonald, the master of Cabinets; the old man\r\nwho remembered the power of an earlier day.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1917 he was offered coalition by the Premier.  He refused.\r\nLaurier knew that coalition meant conscription, and conscription meant\r\ndragooning Quebec.\r\n\r\nIt came home vividly to the old leader in Opposition, whatever it may\r\nhave done had he been in power, that to advocate conscription would\r\ndrive Quebec into the camp of Bourassa from which he and Lomer Gouin\r\nhad between them managed to save a large majority of French-Canadians.\r\nThe struggle of Bourassa to oust Laurier began with the Boer War.  It\r\nwas fated not to end until either leader or the other should quit.\r\nBefore the war Bourassa was flamboyant and defiant.  After it began he\r\nwas openly and brazenly disloyal, when the doctrines he preached were\r\ninflammably acceptable to people uneducated to citizenship in so\r\nconglomerate a thing as Empire.  The easiest thing in the world is for\r\na high wind to sweep a prairie fire.  The war and Bourassa together had\r\nthe power to sweep Quebec, had Laurier and Gouin shown signs of\r\nyielding to the demand for conscription.  I am told that Laurier\r\npersonally believed in conscription but saw this terrible danger of\r\ndisrupting the nation over Quebec.  The war only had staved off the\r\nIrish question, a conference on which was in session when war was\r\ndeclared.  Laurier dreaded the spectre of a second Ireland in Quebec.\r\nHe knew all the forces and how they would operate.  By his own methods,\r\nmistaken or otherwise, he had spent most of his life to achieve unity.\r\nHe dreaded to see that unity imperilled.  I think he would have been\r\nglad to see Quebec enlist as Ontario and other Provinces had done.\r\nThat was impossible.  Conscription was a menace in Quebec to the man\r\nwho had failed to estimate the jack-boot menace in Germany, but who had\r\nnot failed to oppose the idea that navalism in England was as bad as\r\nmilitarism anywhere.\r\n\r\nNo judgment of Laurier, when it comes to be adequately made by the\r\nhistorian, can fail to take account of this sentiment in an old leader\r\nto whom the unity of Canada had become an obsession far transcending\r\nhis original passion for the solidarity of Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Winnipeg convention of 1917 was a piece of almost calculated\r\ncruelty on the part of men who should have known that the old chief's\r\nday was politically done.  His party which for years he had penetrated\r\nwith his personality was slipping into disunion.  Vaguely he knew that\r\nthe western wing of it was almost gone over to Radicalism such as he\r\ncould not control.  But in Ottawa there was an even more direct split.\r\nThere, conscriptionist Liberals called the Convention for the purpose\r\nof proclaiming win-the-war independence of Laurier and considering\r\nCoalition on its merits.  But the western Liberal machine captured it\r\nby a fluke.  For a few days the old chief dreamed that the West had\r\nrallied to his standards.  Then he awoke to the reality that even in\r\nthe east he was head of a divided house.\r\n\r\nThe man who in 1916 had been painted as a ruler of men found in that\r\nsummer of 1917 the Win-the-War Liberals deserting him, some of them\r\nwith sobs.  They loved him well.  He was the old king.  Conscription\r\nwas now the issue.  The Government had decided upon it late in 1916.\r\nIn 1917 the Military Service Act was brought down in the House.\r\nLaurier knew at what it was most directly aimed--Quebec.  He fell back\r\non the ruse of invoking the Militia Act which called for defence only.\r\nThere was no defence.  He knew it.  He moved for a Referendum, knowing\r\nthat in the West, sore over the Wartime Elections Act, and in Quebec,\r\nand in the absence of the soldier vote it might carry by a majority\r\nsufficient to defeat the Government, to force an election and send him\r\nback to power.  He was beaten.  Conscription became the law.  To\r\nenforce it came the Coalition.  The election was held.  The Liberals\r\nwere again beaten--partly by men from their own ranks.\r\n\r\nStill the old king hung on.  He was now too old to let go.  Even the\r\nCoalition might fail.  Or the war might be ended And then----?  The\r\nlast fighting act of his life was to call the Ottawa Liberal\r\nConvention, of the men who had not abandoned his colours; the men for\r\nwhom he was not still holding the open door.  But a few months before\r\nhe died here he was \"up on his toes,\" as George Graham said of him,\r\nsending out battle calls for some election that must come now.  The war\r\nwas over; the army coming home.  The Coalition's day was \"done.\"  Those\r\nstalwarts must return to the fold.\r\n\r\nBut most of them came not.  There was still work for them to do, and\r\nsurely no haste for an election.\r\n\r\nWhat?  No more elections for Laurier?  Not one more chance, after all\r\nthe waiting, for him to finish his work?  Poor old infatuate! splendid\r\neven in his illusions.  There was no work for Laurier to do now.  There\r\nwas no room for him to do it if there had been.  There were few to\r\nfollow him except in Quebec--for in his dotage he would not believe\r\nthat the West had so forsaken him.\r\n\r\nIn a few months he was dead.  And when dead, once again men forgot\r\ntheir political opinions and for a brief while somehow worshipped the\r\nmemory of the man whose life was almost the coming true of a dream,\r\nwhose work was never done, whose evening of life was a tragedy.  And\r\ncase-hardened politicians who had borne the burden and the heat of the\r\nday with Laurier, wept.\r\n\r\nBut the power of Laurier is not dead.  In the long perspective of\r\nhistory the figure of this great Canadian, with his \"sunny ways\" and\r\nhis bewildering Atlas load, will stand out vividly when many of his\r\nsuccessors will be scarcely visible in the haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANDSON OF A PATRIOT\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM LYON MACKENZIE KING\r\n\r\nIn December, 1913, there was a Literary Society dinner in the\r\nUniversity of Toronto at which Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the guest of\r\nhonour and speaker on \"Democracy.\"  My own seat at a table was next to\r\na restless, thick-bodied, sparse-haired man who seemed younger than his\r\nyears and to whom I had not been introduced.  During the hour that\r\nLaurier spoke this man continued to lean over the table so as to catch\r\na view of his fascinating face.  He interested me almost as much as did\r\nthe speaker.  I had never sat beside such an irrepressible vitality.\r\nLike a bird to a succession of swinging boughs, he hung upon the golden\r\nutterances of his old chieftain and political mentor concerning a\r\nsubject so poignantly dear to the experiences of one and the\r\nimagination of the other.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions are sometimes reversed on closer acquaintance.  I was\r\nuncomfortable beside Mackenzie King, but interested.  On a latter\r\noccasion I was still more interested, and rather more uncomfortable.\r\nThe early impression remained, that he had very little faculty of\r\nrestraint--what scientists call inhibition.\r\n\r\nThat occasion will not soon fade from memory.  Often I can hear in\r\nimagination a thousand students singing \"Vive le roi! vive le\r\ncompagnie!\" before the fine old leader spoke, and that earnest, hectic\r\ndisciple joining in.  When I discovered who he was I ran back in fancy\r\nto the time when Mackenzie King was a student at that same university.\r\nAt that time William Mulock was Vice-Chancellor and became keenly\r\ninterested in the brilliant young student of economics with whose\r\nfather he had attended law school.  King entered the University the\r\nyear that the chief author of the National Policy died.  He graduated\r\none year before Laurier became Premier, in the golden age of Liberalism\r\ntriumphant, when \"freer\" trade was emerging as a symbol of that brand\r\nof democracy in opposition to free trade in a minority.  How we have\r\nfallen upon evil days!  Farmers' sons at college no longer regard free\r\ntrade as the forerunner of political absorption by the United States,\r\nbut as the vindication of the farmer as a group in government.\r\n\r\nMackenzie King is a man about whom nobody ever could have a lukewarm\r\nconviction.  He is either cordially liked or disliked.  More than most\r\nother men in public life he has become the victim of violent opinions.\r\nFor this he is temperamentally responsible.  People consistently\r\ndecline to reason about him.  They speak of him vehemently.  His\r\ndominant note of character is rampant enthusiasm.  King is always\r\nintensely in love with whatever interests him.  His enthusiasms are not\r\nso much on the surface for many people, as underneath for causes--and\r\nfor a few men.  Gifted with an uncommon capacity for absorbing\r\nimpressions and collecting data for research, he has made himself a\r\nsort of pathological study to other people.  In mastering economics he\r\nhas himself been enthralled by his own enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Laurier's speech on democracy King was peculiarly\r\nenthusiastic about John D. Rockefeller, Jr., head of the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation.  But he had lost no jot of his fervent admiration for\r\nLaurier in Ottawa and was still passionately devoted--as he remains--to\r\nSir William Mulock, his political godfather.  Nobody has ever\r\ncriticized him for his ardent discipleship to the two older Canadians.\r\nThere is an old-fashioned spontaneity about this mutual regard much\r\nabove the common commercial admiration of one man for another in\r\nbusiness.  Many have blamed King for his attachment to Rockefeller, and\r\nhave used that connection to his detriment as Liberal leader.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1920, he was flatly accused of having been an absentee from\r\nCanada during the war, employed by the Rockefeller interests and so\r\n\"entangled in the octopus\" that as leader of the Liberal party he would\r\nbecome a menace to Canada.  It was the old bogey of continentalism in a\r\nnew setting, and it took Mackenzie King twelve pages of Hansard to make\r\nhis defence in the House.  The incident forms a hinge to a career which\r\nis worth a brief survey.\r\n\r\nKing was born in Berlin, Ontario, son of a subsequent lecturer in law\r\nat Osgoode Hall and of a daughter of William Lyon Mackenzie.  At the\r\nUniversity of Toronto he was one of the '95 group that included also\r\nHamar Greenwood, Arthur Stringer, and the late Norman Duncan and James\r\nTucker.  There was a rebellion during that period in which there is no\r\nrecord of the grandson of a glorious rebel having taken part.  At\r\ncollege he displayed a passion for pardonable egotism in which there\r\nwere elements of a desire for public service.  The Family Compact at\r\nOttawa must have interested him.  Liberalism, as understood by the\r\nLaurier group, was emerging from the disreputable mess known as\r\ncontinentalism, fathered by Goldwin Smith, who was beginning to be\r\nestimated for what he really was, a brilliant philosophical pamphleteer\r\nbent upon the obliteration of Canadian nationality.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation King went for a brief term on the staff of the\r\n_Toronto Globe_.  In that year the Liberals came into power.  King was\r\nengaged by Sir William Mulock, Postmaster-General, to inquire into\r\nsweatshop methods in contracts for postoffice uniforms.  No man could\r\nhave done it better.  He had a native appetite for that sort of\r\ninvestigation, and he was helping to establish the new Liberalism.\r\n\r\nFor the next four years King was out of the country.  Had he followed\r\nthe academic fashion of that period he would have been in training to\r\nbecome a citizen of the United States.  Chicago University, built by\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller, attracted him first; Harvard next.  He was still\r\nstudying economics.  No other Canadian had ever spent so much time and\r\ntalent on this subject.  At Harvard he became a Lecturer, and was sent\r\nto Europe to investigate economic conditions.  While there he got a\r\ncable from the Postmaster-General of Canada, who had created the\r\nDepartment of Labour as an adjunct to the postal department, and\r\nestablished the _Labour Gazette_, and wanted a deputy who should edit\r\nthe _Gazette_ and look after the details of the office.  King\r\ncourteously declined, saying that he could not accept until the expiry\r\nof his contract with Harvard.  The salary of the Deputy-Minister of\r\nLabour was $2,500 under a man whom he tremendously admired, and as yet\r\nwith no clear ambition to become a member of the House led by the man\r\nwhom he was afterwards to worship, and to succeed.\r\n\r\nThere is no proof that Laurier took any uncommon interest at this time,\r\nas he afterwards did, in the Deputy-Minister of Labour, though he\r\nnoticed that the young man was making a great success of his work.\r\nMuch if not most of King's tuition in politics at this stage came from\r\nWilliam Mulock, who as a member of the Commons in Opposition, had\r\nfathered the fair trade resolution in Convention and did much to\r\nconvert the Liberal party from free to \"freer\" trade.\r\n\r\nIn the eight years up till 1908, by experience with conditions, King\r\nmade himself master of the subject which was later to appear in his\r\nbook, \"Industry and Humanity.\"  He was repeatedly made chairman of this\r\nor that mission, board, and commission at home or abroad, to get the\r\ntrue facts about labour, immigration and employment.  By a sort of\r\ngenius for conciliating groups, even when he antagonized individuals,\r\nhe became for a time the world's most successful mediator in labour\r\ndisputes.  Industrial warfare had not as yet adopted the trench system.\r\nDirect action, the One Big Union, the sympathetic strike and collective\r\nbargaining were scarcely dreamed of, though anticipated in the\r\nphilosophy of Karl Marx, as yet not transplanted to America.\r\nSocialism, as expressed by Henry George, whose \"Progress and Poverty\"\r\nwas a classic in King's college days, was the most radical element with\r\nwhich the young Deputy had to deal.  But the Government's policy of\r\nforeign labour nationals being gradually absorbed into labour unions\r\nmade Canada, in proportion to population, a very difficult country in\r\nwhich to act as conciliator.\r\n\r\nDuring his eight years as Deputy, King was made two offers, each of\r\nwhich illuminates the criticism that in the war he was only a nominal\r\ncitizen of Canada.  A group of Canadian employers, recognizing his\r\nsuccess as a mediator, offered him $8,000 a year to act on their behalf\r\nwith the heads of labour.  Without consulting his chief, King declined\r\nthe offer.  He said that he preferred the $2,500 from the Labour\r\nDepartment, where he could be independent of either one side or the\r\nother.  Later President Eliot, of Harvard, on the death of the man who\r\noccupied the chair of political economy, offered King the post,\r\npointing out that his duties would keep him but six months a year in\r\nBoston.  The salary was at least twice what he was getting in Ottawa.\r\nAgain without consulting his chief, King declined, on the pretext that\r\nhe had no desire to leave the useful work he was doing for the Ottawa\r\nGovernment to become a citizen, even of eminence, in the United States.\r\nDuring the same period he was asked to act as conciliator in a great\r\nmining strike in Colorado, when violence and murder were the law, and\r\nwhen the result of his action led to the enactment of a successful\r\narbitration measure by the Government of Colorado.\r\n\r\nAll this was prior to King's election as member of the House of\r\nCommons.  Eight years as Deputy in the Department of Labour, he stepped\r\ninto the Commons and the Ministry of Labour with exceptional qualities\r\nto succeed.  His record as Minister was the natural but uncommon sequel\r\nto his experience as Deputy.  King was so long the one man whose whole\r\ntime was spent in the effort to reconcile industry and humanity in\r\nCanada that it seems hard to recollect that he spent but three years as\r\nMinister.  During that time, as well as before it, he became the ardent\r\ndisciple of Laurier.  While there was great advantage in having spent\r\nso many years as Deputy, it is a pity for the sake of the young\r\nleader's subsequent elevation that he did not come under the spell of\r\nthe old chieftain as a candidate before Laurier had begun to grow\r\ncynical in office.  In 1908 Laurier had been at least three years tired\r\nof public life when there was no man to succeed him, and when, as often\r\nas he expressed his weariness of trying to govern a nation so\r\ntemperamentally difficult as Canada, he was tempted by the adulation of\r\nhis supporters to try again, until winning elections for the sake of\r\nremaining in power became a habit.\r\n\r\nAdmiration such as King felt for Laurier made criticism impossible.  He\r\nworshipped Laurier.  In this he was not alone.  Older men than King,\r\namong his colleagues, shared the same spell-binding sentiment.  And\r\nthere was no member of the Cabinet who grieved more than King at the\r\ndefeat of Laurier in 1911.\r\n\r\nHere begins the Standard Oil story.  The _Montreal Gazette_, in a\r\nreport of two speeches made at a certain club, published an accusation\r\nthat King had \"deserted Canada in her hour of crisis in search of\r\nStandard Oil millions.\"\r\n\r\nAs similar statements may be made during the election campaign, it is\r\nfair to know the facts.  King was employed by the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation, not by Standard Oil.  The connection is merely one of cause\r\nand effect.  The Foundation spends on the wholesale betterment of\r\nhumanity the multi-millions which Standard Oil accumulated from the\r\npeople.  The theory of justification here is that the people would have\r\nspent these millions foolishly, whereas the Foundation spends them\r\nwell.  There is some truth in the theory.  King was engaged solely upon\r\nthe industrial relations programme of the Foundation, with special\r\nreference later to industries of war, and with permission according to\r\nhis own stipulation to conduct his researches in Ottawa from which in\r\nthe ten years between 1911 and 1921 he has been absent only upon\r\nspecial occasions.  He was in the unusual position of working in Canada\r\nand being paid in the United States, for researches of benefit to the\r\ncause of American industrial relations during the war.  His book,\r\nIndustry and Humanity, which is the literary form of those researches,\r\nwas all written in Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThese are respectable facts; the only objection to which is that the\r\nfull statement of the apologia occupies twelve pages of Hansard and\r\nmust have taken at least two hours of Parliamentary time.  The original\r\naccusation was a malicious stupidity.  The vindication was a\r\nconfessional in which the Liberal leader told the House every item that\r\nhe knew.  Half the number of words would have been twice as effective.\r\n\r\nThis introduces my second impression of the Liberal leader, two years\r\nafter the outbreak of war, at midnight in a baronial farmhouse in North\r\nYork, Ont.  He had been addressing a political meeting in a\r\nschool-house some miles away.  There was a golden harvest moon and the\r\nscene from the spacious piazza overlooking the hills of York was a\r\ndream of pastoral poetry.  Suddenly motor headlights flared out of the\r\navenue and from the car alighted the same restless man whom I had met\r\nthree years before at the dinner to democracy.  In a very little while\r\nwe both became so interested in what he had to say that neither of us\r\ncared to go to bed.\r\n\r\nNext day I found him still more interesting.  He spoke with bubbling\r\nfrankness and uncontrolled fervour about many things and certain\r\npeople, chief among whom was John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  He described the\r\nyoung magnate's trip into Colorado during a recent great strike, an\r\nitinerary planned on purpose that the son of John D. Rockefeller might\r\nget a first-hand knowledge of what conditions actually were, what the\r\nlabour leaders thought, and what sort of people they might be.  With\r\ngraphic interest he described the young financier's reception by the\r\nminers, the speech he made, the big dance in which he took part, the\r\ncamps and mines he visited; a picture of capital conciliating labour\r\nsuch as seldom comes to notice outside the pages of a novel.  He made\r\nno effort to eulogize himself.  He was absorbed in generous admiration\r\nfor the other man and with enthusiasm for the glorious chance that\r\nRockefeller seemed to have to make a new Magna Charta of brotherhood\r\nbetween Capital and Labour.  In this he was a tremendous idealist.  In\r\nmany respects one was forced to regret that the world somehow did not\r\nseem quite so full of brotherly intention as Mr. King said that it was.\r\n\r\n\"The common ground of both capital and labour is humanity,\" he said\r\nover and over in various form.  \"The antagonism of each will be\r\nforgotten when both unite in an effort to forward the interests of the\r\nwhole community without which neither can prosper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" I felt like screaming, had there been a moment to do so.\r\n\"Bravo!\"\r\n\r\nThe idea found expression in his book which he was then engaged in\r\nwriting.  And it is doubtful if any book on the subject of political\r\neconomy was ever the source of greater happiness to its author than\r\n\"Industry and Humanity\" was to Mackenzie King.  On the merits of\r\ndemocratic statesmanship as revealed in that book, Mackenzie King\r\nshould be Premier of Canada in 1922.  Alas! men are often greater in\r\nwhat they say than in much they are able to do.  Mackenzie King is a\r\nspecies of rather emotional idealist.  He has studied economic humanity\r\nsomewhat at the expense of his perception of human nature.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening King talked with equal gusto upon his intimate\r\nknowledge of a certain popular song writer in Chicago, the story of\r\nwhose life he told with vivid strokes of descriptive pathos; and upon\r\nhis still more intimate acquaintance with the late William Wilfred\r\nCampbell, poet, whom he had seen in the same moment feed his pigs in a\r\nnear suburb of Ottawa, and create a line of poetry--which King\r\nquoted--\"The wild witchery of the winter woods.\"  He was seized with\r\nthe idea that a Foundation such as the Rockefeller should subsidize\r\npoets and song-writers.  The pity of it always is that the world is far\r\ntoo desperately cynical in high places to accommodate such generous\r\nimpulses.  Mackenzie King's fervent advocacy of a reform sometimes\r\ncreates more antagonism than the cold attacks of an adversary.  His\r\npassion for the betterment of humanity often outruns his judgment.  His\r\nstatements smack of exaggeration even when they are absolutely true.\r\nHe lacks a sense of proportion and a capacity for restraint.  \"Better\r\nis he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.\"  But a\r\npolitical leader must do both.\r\n\r\nHad he expected the Liberal leadership, the close of the war and almost\r\nthe end of Laurier should have found the member for Prince ready for\r\naction or advice.  But there is no record that, at this time, his\r\ncounsels were sought by the Liberal party, or that he thrust himself\r\ninto the limelight.  Three months after the Armistice, Laurier was\r\ndead.  Even then King was not mentioned as his successor.  Four months\r\nlater he was chosen, when not even he quite understood how it was done.\r\nKing did nothing to reform his party along new lines, or publicly to\r\nstate what he considered its reasonable position to be as between the\r\nUnion party and the Agrarians.  A broad manifesto from the new leader\r\nat such a time would have been useful.  Never had a political leader in\r\nCanada such a duty of broad revision within his party.  King neglected\r\nthe opportunity.  The _Toronto Globe_ realizes what a squeezed lemon\r\nthe Liberal party has become between the other two groups and calls for\r\na working alliance between the Liberals and Agrarians to upset the\r\nGovernment.  The _Mail and Empire_ paternally points out that it is the\r\nduty of Liberals to enlist, Quebec included, under the hegemony of the\r\nparty which has already incorporated Liberals and is ready to save that\r\nparty from obliteration by the free-trade group.\r\n\r\nBeneath the conventional assurance displayed in each of these organs of\r\npublic opinion one detects an under-current of uneasiness, by no means\r\nmitigated by the farmer victory for the Commons in Medicine Hat, which\r\nthe _Globe_ construed as a triumph on parade, and the Agrarian turnover\r\nin Alberta which the _Mail and Empire_ with all its sturdy\r\nprotestations cannot honestly interpret as other than a calamity.  Each\r\nof the historic parties feels itself confronted by a new sort of menace\r\ncomparable to nothing in the history of Canadian politics.  Two parties\r\nwhich ten years ago were in opposition are now flung together by the\r\nfear of a common danger and refuse to admit it.  _The Globe's_ hope is\r\nthat Farmerism will become the new Liberalism.  _The Globe_ is right.\r\nBut the captains may not be of _The Globe's_ choosing and the planks in\r\nits platform are not those which _The Globe_ in its days of sanity\r\nwould have accepted for the good of the people.  It is the intention of\r\nFarmerism to absorb all there is of Liberalism.  Mackenzie King knows\r\nit.  He knows that the Liberals will suffer more than the Government\r\nfrom the plough movement.  Yet he is invited by _The Globe_ to try the\r\ntrick of the bird swallowing the snake!\r\n\r\nThe essence of Liberalism has always been liberation; emancipation.\r\nBut the farmers are out to smite all the shackles from all of us.  They\r\nintend to stop short only of Bolshevism.  An ex-Cabinet Minister of\r\nAlberta predicts that the farmers will sweep the country at the next\r\nelection and steer it down the rapids of economic ruin.  He cites Drury\r\nand Co. as examples of a certain sort of cunning whereby they did not\r\nat first show their real hand, in order to get people to feel that\r\nAgrarianism is not half so bad as painted and then--the broadening out\r\ninto the People's party.  The farmers are not notorious for sheer\r\ncunning; neither for stupidity.  They are naturally hesitant about\r\nbeing as radical in office as they were on the stump.  As an economic\r\ngroup they are no different from the old Free Trade Liberals, except\r\nthat they seek to govern as a class on behalf of that particular group.\r\nMeanwhile the nation more or less opposed to farmerism is\r\ndisintegrating itself into more groups.  Labour is out for a species of\r\nself-determination; a Labour Party.  A veteran Liberal statesman\r\nrecently asked me this question:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that in industrial centres like Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton\r\nand Winnipeg, Labour puts a candidate into every constituency; that\r\nin smaller factory centres which dominate essentially rural ridings\r\nthey do the same.  In each of these more or less labour-dominated\r\nfields suppose we have the possible four candidates.  Is the\r\nLabour-Unionist in doubt over his own candidate going to vote Liberal,\r\nLiberal-Conservative, or Farmer?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a man of long experience in elections--suppose you answer that?\" I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nHe did not, but went on:\r\n\r\n\"I know what I should say to a labour elector under such circumstances.\r\nI should say to him: 'You had better not touch the farmer candidate\r\nwith a ten-foot pole because--the farmer wants dear food and you want\r\ncheap food; he wants long hours and you want short hours; he wants\r\nimported manufactures and you want employment in your home town; he\r\nwants free trade and you depend upon a measure of protection.'\"\r\n\r\nNobody has ever more pithily stated the case.  There is no basic\r\nmutuality between the farm and the labour union.  The farmer is as much\r\na capitalist as he is a labourer.\r\n\r\nI asked the Liberal statesman bluntly:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that in order to avoid political devastation by\r\nsplitting the vote into three opposition groups each fighting the\r\nother, it is the immediate business of the two historic parties to\r\nunite against all parties of experiment, especially against the\r\nemancipating fanner?\"\r\n\r\nHe gave this evasive but shrewd reply:\r\n\r\n\"I am a lifelong Liberal.  I have been in the habit of reading\r\nnewspapers on both sides of politics.  I am now driven to take the\r\nConservative organ for my daily political food.\"\r\n\r\nI commend that answer to Hon. Mackenzie King.  If the Liberal leader is\r\nnow as anxious to serve the nation of his birth as he was when he twice\r\nrefused large salaries and comparative ease for the sake of continuing\r\nto do Canada's work, would it be high treason either to himself or to\r\nhis party to call a Liberal convention out of which he would father a\r\nresolution of federation of historic parties based upon such a\r\ncompromise as Macdonald created in the federation of provinces?\r\n\r\nThe answer is obvious: \"Fantastic!  Absurd!  Impossible!\"\r\n\r\nMackenzie King will put up a smoke screen to hide the defection of the\r\nWest from historic Liberalism.  He will insist that the Liberals want\r\nonly a reasonable tariff for revenue while the Government want\r\nprotection--when Heaven knows each of them wants substantially the same\r\nthing in opposition to the farmer who wants everything.  He will point\r\nwith confident pride to the solid Liberal _bloc_ Quebec, when he knows\r\nQuebec is dominated by Lapointe who can demand from him just what he\r\nwants as the price of Quebec's solidarity; and he knows equally well\r\nthat Quebec is as much opposed to continentalism as the\r\nLiberal-Conservative Government can ever be.  The man who wears the\r\nmantle of Laurier without his Orphean magic cannot lead Quebec.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mackenzie King was put where he is to lead, and he intends to\r\nkeep on doing it.  If he can regulate a few of his enthusiasms and so\r\nadjust his personality as to make Liberalism as led by him powerful\r\nenough to be the dog that wags the Agrarian tail, he should be set down\r\nas one of the most remarkable men in the history of Canadian politics.\r\nHe legitimately chuckles over Quebec.  One can fancy him matching that\r\nrace-group against the Agrarian _bloc_ and the Government industrial\r\ncentres group, and saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Labour may lop a few from the Government; Michael Clark a few from the\r\nfarmers--enough to make my friend Mr. Crerar a most excellent colleague\r\nin my Coalition.  Excellent fellow, Crerar!\"\r\n\r\nA low-tariff group, of whom 75 per cent. are Quebeckers, amalgamated\r\nwith a no-tariff group who are near-Continentalists, is at least\r\nentitled to serious regard as a fantastic experiment in administration.\r\nBut we may trust Hon. Mackenzie King to simulate a vast moving-picture\r\nsmile of high benevolence and great sagacity as he contemplates such a\r\nfantasia--with himself as the chief tight-rope performer and Niagara\r\nroaring below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER ONE HARD\r\n\r\nHON. T. A. CRERAR\r\n\r\nSome Frank Norris such as wrote \"The Pit\" and \"The Octopus\" should arise\r\nin Canada and write a Wheat-Politics novel about T. A. Crerar.  This\r\nman's photograph was once published squatting Big-Chief-wise in the front\r\nrow of 300 farmers on a raid to Ottawa--I think early in the war about\r\nprices.  It was a second to the last delegation which the farmers intend\r\nto send to Ottawa.  The next one was in 1918, when the farmers went to\r\nprotest against conscription.  If you ask T. A. Crerar to-day, he will\r\npredict that in days not far to come manufacturers will petition a farmer\r\ngovernment in Ottawa.  Because the farmers in the West regard Crerar as\r\nalmost a geological process, which sometimes results in a volcano.\r\n\r\nCrerar was projected into public affairs by 50-cent wheat, monopolistic\r\nelevator companies, discriminating railways and protected manufacturers;\r\nall of which, while he was still a young man who should have been going\r\nto dances and arguing about the genesis of sin, he concluded were into a\r\ndark conspiracy to make a downtrodden helot of the prairie farmer.\r\nTo-day Crerar is at the apex of a movement.  He embodies the politically\r\nand commercially organized campaign of the biggest interest in Canada\r\nagainst all other merely \"big\" interests.  He is willing to let himself\r\nbe talked about as the next Premier of industrial and agricultural Canada\r\non behalf of all the farmers whom he can persuade to elect him a majority\r\nminority in the next Parliament.  And the prospect does not even dazzle\r\nhim, or awe his colleagues of the coonskin coats and the truculent\r\nwhiskers.\r\n\r\nCrerar began responsible life as a farm boy in Manitoba, taught school,\r\nand managed a small elevator company; he became President of the United\r\nGrain Growers and of the Canadian Council of Agriculture--and the next\r\nobvious thing to say is that he entered politics as Minister of\r\nAgriculture in the Union Government.  But T. A. Crerar had been in\r\npolitics a long while before that, though he had never even run for\r\nParliament or legislature.  Unusual, unprofessional politics.  Hear what\r\nthe present Secretary of the Canadian Council of Agriculture has to say\r\nabout the parliaments of the Grain-Growers in 1916:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Their annual conventions are parliaments of the Middle Western\r\nProvinces.  Resolutions and recommendations of all sorts and description\r\nare debated and decided upon.  Questions of far-reaching influence,\r\nsocially and morally, have their beginning, so far as Western Canada is\r\nconcerned, in the Grain Growers' Conventions.  Records of these\r\nAssociations show that besides recommending the establishment of\r\nco-operative elevators, co-operative banks, co-operative dairies, free\r\ntrade, single tax and a dozen other economics reform, the Grain Growers\r\nin convention fathered Prohibition long before it was adopted, advised\r\nand urged woman suffrage many years before that measure was generally\r\nfavoured, and were the first sponsors of the idea of direct legislation.\r\nThe Grain Growers' Association and their annual conventions are the\r\nsource and inspiration of all the commercial activities, and social and\r\npolitical reforms with which one finds the name of Grain Grower connected\r\nso often in Western Canada!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the reforming political school that has trained the man now\r\nopenly discussed as the next Premier of Canada.  And for the benefit of\r\nany Canadian Norris who dreams of writing a problem novel about Crerar,\r\nit may be said that he is the most drab and unpicturesque personality\r\nthat ever stood in line for any such office in this country.  In the\r\ntriangle of leaders at Ottawa he is the angle of lowest personal, though\r\nby no means lowest human, interest.  Meighen is impressive; King\r\nbrilliant.  Crerar--is business.  He would be a hard nut for a novelist\r\nto crack.  A man like Smillie impresses the imagination.  Crerar, who is\r\nto the Canadian farmer what Smillie was to the British miner, invites\r\nonly judgment.\r\n\r\nThe first time I met Crerar--at lunch in a small eastern club--he\r\nimpressed me as a man enormously capable in business, tersely direct in\r\nhis judgments, somewhat satirical and inordinately sensitive.  He seemed\r\nwary, almost cryptic in his remarks.  Recently sworn in as Unionist\r\nMinister of Agriculture, he had turned his back on Winnipeg, where he was\r\na sort of agrarian king, and taken his first dip into the cynical waters\r\nof Ottawa, where he was but one of a Ministerial group some of whom were\r\nabler and more interesting than himself.  He had not yet appeared in\r\nParliament.  He dreaded the ordeal.  He had no knowledge of just to what\r\nprogramme he would be expected to adhere, except the general one of\r\nwinning the war.  He had little enthusiasm for the Premier, probably less\r\nfor most of his colleagues.  So far as he had been able to survey Ottawa,\r\nhe considered it an administrative mess.  His direct ways of doing\r\nbusiness were menaced by a sense of muddle and officialdom.  He missed\r\nthe breezy, open ways of \"the Peg\" and the sensation of being general\r\nmanager of the biggest commercial concern west of the lakes, the Grain\r\nGrowers' Grain Co.  Crerar could not business-manage Ottawa.  When he\r\nopened his Agriculture door he saw no box cars trailing in from the\r\nelevator pyramids on the skyline; he smelled no wheat; he saw no\r\n\"horny-handed\" farmers writing checks to cover their speculative\r\ninvestments in grain which they had not yet sown.  No wheat-mining\r\ncomrade motoring in from the plains came to thrust his boots up on the\r\ngeneral manager's desk and say, \"Believe me, Tom, I paid thirteen-ninety\r\nfor those protected articles.  What a shame!\"\r\n\r\nCrerar complained of indigestion.  I think his nerves were on edge.  I\r\nasked him if he expected to co-relate Agriculture with Food Control and\r\nTrade and Commerce.  \"Oh, I suppose so,\" he said wearily.  \"Nobody in\r\nUnion Government knows what he will do yet.  I don't like Ottawa.  Its\r\nwhole atmosphere is foreign to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed almost contemptuous.  He had made the patriotic plunge in order\r\nto put his particular brand of radical Liberalism at the service of a\r\nTory-Unionist Government.  He did not like it.  Of all the Liberals who\r\nentered the Union Cabinet he was the sworn Radical.  Both Calder and\r\nSifton were machine men from governments that still had Liberal labels on\r\ntheir luggage.  Crerar represented the great inter-prairie group of no\r\ncompromise and of economic enmity to the Tories.  He was rather looking\r\nfor trouble; thinking rather hard of how he could get through with such\r\nan uncomfortable job, do it well and get back uncontaminated to his own\r\ndear land of the wheat and his fine office in the most handsome suite of\r\noffices in the Grain Exchange at Winnipeg.  The Ottawa that he hated was\r\nthe Capital that old line politicians had created.  He was looking\r\nforward to some Ottawa of the future which like Canberra, the new dream\r\nCapital of Australia, might be vacuum-cleaned and disinfected of all the\r\nold partisan microbes.\r\n\r\nCrerar made his success in a country where the visible signs of getting\r\non in the world are a bigger factor than anywhere else in Canada.  The\r\nprairies are mysterious and sublime.  The West is plain big business.\r\nCrerar represents the West rather than the prairies.  He is\r\ntemperamentally a man of Ontario, where he was born; solidly businesslike\r\nand persistent.  He glorifies hard work.  And he went West at a time when\r\nthe law of hard work was just coming to replace the old-timer's creed of\r\nhanging on and waiting for something--usually a railway--to turn up.  He\r\ncame up with the farmer of 60-cent wheat in a part of the country where\r\neverything that the farmer had to buy in order to produce that kind of\r\nwheat was high in cost.  Cheap wheat and dear wherewithals have been to\r\nT. A. Crerar and his kind Number One Hard experience.  His axioms began\r\nwith the plough made under a high tariff.  His code of ethics was evolved\r\nfrom the self-binder, railroaded the long haul by systems that thrive on\r\nthe tariff.  His community religion--not his personal, which one believes\r\nhas been pretty devoutly established--is embodied in the emotions of the\r\nskyline elevator following the trail of the steel and the twist of the\r\nbox car.\r\n\r\nOne cannot mention these rudimentary western things without a species of\r\nenthusiasm for the Westerner, and a consequent precarious sympathy with\r\nthe views of Mr. Crerar.  Transplant yourself even for a year, as the\r\nwriter did twenty years ago, to the far northwest, and you begin in spite\r\nof all your previously inrooted sentiments, to share the beliefs and talk\r\nthe language that lie at the basis of even so arrogant an organization as\r\nthe Grain Growers' Association and so inordinate an oligarchy as the\r\nCanadian Council of Agriculture.  A man cannot fight the paralyzing\r\ncombination of drouth, wet, early frost, rust, weevil, grasshoppers,\r\neastern manufacturers, high tariffs, centralized banks and bankrupt\r\noctopean railways in the production of under-dollar wheat, without losing\r\nmuch of his faith in the smug laws of economy laid down by men who buy\r\nand sell close to the centres of production.\r\n\r\nNow begins the work of the novelist, making _precis_ notes for his Crerar\r\nmasterpiece; investigating the prairie farm of 1900, anywhere between the\r\nmain line and the skyline.  For the sake of space we copy his notes,\r\nhastily sketched:\r\n\r\nLow hill--General aspect, poplar bluffs, billowy landscape--Log and\r\nmudchink shack; pole and sod roof--stable and shed ditto--Three or four\r\ncattle and lashions of grass--Broncho team and new high-painted wagon--No\r\nfamily--Dash churn--Lucky to have a wife--Some hens--Sod-breaking plough,\r\nlong snout, breaks odd fields twixt bluffs--Coal-black loam,\r\nstrong--Wheat and oats, wonderful early growth--Drouth first year--Second\r\nyear, pole fences, more fields, and wet season--More crops but half\r\nspoiled by wet--Sacks on trail to cars, toiling across prairie to\r\nelevator--Smudge of train, bit of a town and a tank--No cars to load\r\ngrain--Must sell to elevator--Monopoly--Low price--Grading wheat to No. 2\r\nNorthern--55 cents, used to be 40--Lien note to pay on wagon and\r\nbinder--Goes to indignation meeting--Lots of that--Farmer\r\nrevolutionaries--Want Gov't. to pass acts compelling Rys. to supply\r\nfarmers cars to break low-price monopoly of elevators--Act passed, but\r\nroads in league with elevators--Same old trouble--Rise of radical\r\nleaders--Organization of farmers into group to fight interests--Helots on\r\nprairies--Helpless unless organized--Only partial relief from Gov't.--Two\r\nnew provinces in 1905--Grits make great splash, promising Utopia along\r\nwith newer trunk lines and big towns, etc.--Farmer grins, goes on\r\norganizing, in each province association of grain growers (G.G.)--Every\r\nfew towns some fiery evangel--Great on conventions, regular convenanters,\r\nold style--Schools of debate and Utopian legislation--Gov'ts. wear\r\ngoggles and organize elections--Farmer organizes group ideas, to oppose\r\nold line politics--Say Eastern old parties effete in West--Townsmen\r\nleague with farmers, common interest; low price wheat means lean\r\npurchases and laggard towns--By this time young man Crerar in Wpg., taken\r\nfrom managing small elevator company to be general manager G.G. Grain\r\nCo.--Co-op. movement develops in all associations, for buying and\r\nselling--G.G.G. Co. give farmer equal rights with city man in speculation\r\non what farmer grows--Horn into Grain Exchange, little office--Under\r\nCrerar Co. grows to much the biggest corporation in Exchange; whole\r\nground floor offices of G.G.G. Co. which as commercial organization\r\nfocuses the buying and selling end of whole agrarian movement--Head of\r\nthis, naturally chief of movement--All remedial and legislative\r\nprogrammes merged in economics of G.G.G. Co.--Crerar wiry, quiet\r\nexecutive, now fuse plug to a real agrarian party with a programme which\r\nthrough Canadian Council of Agriculture, members from all over Canada,\r\nconstitutes itself a parliament of farmers telling old parties to go to\r\nthe devil--Liberal gov'ts in prairie province mere annexes of new radical\r\ngroup which is now bigger nationalist force than Quebec ever was, ready\r\nto march upon Ottawa----\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this basis the novelist builds his political fabric of Crerar, who\r\nbegan life as a Laurier Liberal, became a Free Trader of the Michael\r\nClark school, and ten years ago gave symptoms of pushing the economic\r\nside of the agrarian movement to a point where it aimed to become the new\r\nLiberalism of the prairies.  He was the business head of a revolutionary\r\nmovement of which other men became the ardent, flaming crusaders, both in\r\nand out of Ottawa.  Crerar calmly evolved his practical evangelism out of\r\nthe ledger of exports and imports.  Nothing excited him so deeply as\r\ncomparative statistics.  He never trusted to the moral or emotional side\r\nof the case.  His crusade was in the national ledger.  His church was the\r\nelevator; his economic Bible the Grain Growers' Guide.\r\n\r\nSince 1914 or thereabouts this man has kept his balance at the head of a\r\nmovement that split again and again into local factions only to come\r\ntogether again in the head offices of the Grain Growers' Grain Co.  and\r\nthe Canadian Council of Agriculture.  He represented multi-millions of\r\ninvestment in land, agriculture, co-operative commercial enterprises and\r\nspeculation.  On the ground floor of the Grain Exchange he was at the\r\nhead of the greatest organization in the world speculating in visible\r\nsupply wheat.  The grain that Crerar's cohorts bought and sold was either\r\njust sown, or heading out, or being threshed, or it was crawling to\r\nWinnipeg in miles of box cars on its way to Fort William.  In wheat he\r\nput his trust; in railways and steamships never; in centralized banks and\r\neastern manufacturers not at all; in old parties at Ottawa still less--if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nCrerarism was becoming power to act.  Behind Crerar was a sullen but\r\noptimistic reformation of such varied emotional character that none but a\r\nquiet, steady man could have controlled it in Winnipeg.  The novelist's\r\nprairie farm was now a power in the land.  It was Agrarianism; that had\r\nbolted like an ostrich both old parties in the West, and now offered a\r\nnew one supposed to contain as a new National Policy a general and\r\nitemized contradiction of the old N.P. of 1878--The National Progressive\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nNo economic crusade had ever been so rapid, gigantic and revolutionary.\r\nTrades unionism had taken decades to make head where the Agrarian\r\nmovement took years.  The One Big Union of the Reds, anarching against\r\nall Government as it is, merely applied the principle of direct action\r\nwhich the farmers had taught them by suggestion in the unofficial\r\nparliaments of the prairie.  The Agrarian is himself a One-Big-Unionist.\r\nHis concern is not with wages and hours, but with exports, imports and\r\nelections.  The Agrarian will not strike.  Crerar knows that.  He must\r\nnot tie up communities and stop trade.  He must work through Parliament.\r\nHis aim is to establish farmerism as the basis of the nation.  His creed\r\nis, that no matter what use we make of raw material, cheap power,\r\nmanufacturing experience and capital, Canada's greatest revenue and\r\nexport production must be in the farm; and that therefore national\r\nlegislation must gravitate about the farmer's garage.\r\n\r\nThis thing came to a head in a part of the country which contains less\r\nthan one-sixth of Canada's total population, and more than half of them\r\nCanadians only by immigration.  The one biggest man in the whole\r\nmovement, besides Mr. Crerar, the man who practically elected the new\r\nfarmer Premier of Alberta by appointment, is an American born.  H. W.\r\nWood, the Czar of Alberta, came as a farmer in search of cheaper land\r\nfrom the Western States.  He is a good citizen, and as much entitled to\r\nplay strong-arm in our politics as any native Canadian is to enter the\r\nCabinet of the United States.  But as a rule a free people resent men\r\nfrom other countries agitating for revolution on behalf of an original\r\nsmall minority in a part of the country where industrialism can never\r\nbecome more than a sideshow in the business of production.  A people of\r\nnational consciousness do not relish the idea of a minority group\r\norganized to the last man and the last acre, trying to organize a\r\nnation-wide group in provinces where the factory and the mine and the\r\nfishery are at least as important as the farm.\r\n\r\nThe whole plan smacks too much of engineering.  It is a case of complete,\r\nalmost Teutonic, organization masquerading as a sort of democracy, but in\r\nreality a controlled tyranny whose aim so far as at present defined, is\r\nto establish group government under a camouflage of the National\r\nProgressive Party, and by means of the power so obtained or by alliances\r\nwith some other group, to upset the whole economic structure which it has\r\ntaken fifty years to build up.  No true citizen will object to farmers in\r\nParliament and many of them.  None but a slave will consent to a\r\nParliament dominated by any group, whether farmers, manufacturers,\r\nlawyers or labourites.  Democracy means free government on behalf of the\r\npeople; not on behalf of a great group which arrogates by organized\r\nmajorities the right to represent the people.  Agrarianism is not a\r\nnation-wide interest.  Quebec has more to hope from the Government now in\r\npower than from the farmers.  Ontario cannot elect a clear working\r\nmajority of farmers.  It is the West and the West only, which has become\r\nAgrarianism rampant.  And according to the new officialdom of the West\r\nthe farmer must save us all.  Elect him to Administration and he will\r\nopen the golden gates of real prosperity by establishing a maximum of\r\nfree trade, on the assumption that our present protective investment in\r\ngreat railways (two of them bankrupt), in banks, industries and\r\nspeculative land is all wrong.\r\n\r\nThe prospect glitters.  Mr. Crerar is not dazzled.  He sees with a calm\r\nand collective gaze into the future.  He contemplates with profound\r\nelation the scrapping of our present system built by experience, and the\r\nsetting up of another which makes theories a substitute.  Nothing is\r\ndifficult to a revolutionist.  Crerar's success in building Agrarian\r\ngrand opera is a mere augury in his mind to still greater success in\r\nrebuilding a nation, which he thinks is the same thing because the farmer\r\nis the nation; and a nation is the easiest thing in the world to\r\nrevolutionize so long as you do not obliterate its institutions.  We are\r\nnot expected to abolish Commons, or Cabinets, or even the poor old\r\nSenate--until further notice.  Mr. Crerar may need them all in his\r\nbusiness.  \"For this relief much thanks!\"  Mr. Crerar is not to be\r\nnicknamed Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Underwood Tariff and the Agrarian majority in Medicine\r\nHat gave him great joy.  The prospect for a farmer victory in the general\r\nelection is to him almost certain by some form of coalition--perhaps with\r\nthe Liberals; possibly with Labourites.  In 1920 a man very close to\r\nCrerar estimated a return of 75 National Progressives in a total of 235\r\nhad the election been held at that time.  Since then farmer prospects\r\nhave bulled on the market.  Alberta has gone Agrarian, following Medicine\r\nHat.  Organization has been extended.  The old Liberalism on the prairies\r\nhas been absorbed.  Dafoe, of the _Free Press_, has swung into line with\r\nCrerar.  There is prospect of the Government winning some seats in the\r\nWest, as there is of the Liberals fielding candidates who will not be\r\nelected.  Ontario is already a loose-jointed but effective part of the\r\nmovement.  Business is not good.  A time of trade depression has always\r\nbeen a good time for a change of government, even along orthodox lines.\r\nThe present economic aftermath of destructive war and a large element of\r\nI-Won't-Work labour along with high wages no matter what else falls, must\r\nlook to Crerar like a good time to make us all believe that we shall all\r\nget through to Canaan if we follow his Ark of the Covenant.  He is able\r\nto assure us of cheap clothes and furniture and machinery, because the\r\nfarmer needs these things in the production of food, which must not\r\nbecome too cheap or the advantage will be lost.  What is to become of our\r\nindustries is not clearly stated; but if living is to be so cheap we\r\nshall probably not need employment except on the farms; though under free\r\ntrade we are told that industry, free to flow, is sure to locate itself\r\nat the point of advantage in material, power, transportation, and getting\r\nto market.  In fact some free traders blithely tell us that once you get\r\nrid of tariffs, living becomes so cheap that people naturally flock to\r\nthe free trade country, and industry is bound to follow the people;\r\ntherefore free trade will give us factories as we need them.\r\n\r\nThere is no end of the mirage for your head and morass for your feet once\r\nyou begin to consider the possibilities of a revolution.  We had somewhat\r\nthe same experience forty odd years ago in the forests of smokestacks\r\nsupposed to spring up in the wake of the National Policy.  It took a long\r\nwhile and much hard patient work to get those smokestacks.  Now we have\r\ngot them as part of our national equipment, along with great water powers\r\nand long-haul railways and centralized banks and a number of trusts and\r\nan undeniable number of dear manufactures under a tariff--and Mr. Crerar\r\npurposes to abolish the whole thing, to begin all over again as it was in\r\nthe beginning, except that even then if the farmer had lost his market\r\ntown on Saturday he would have been in a very bad way for his Sunday\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nIn short, Crerar proposes one more revolution, whether by one fell swoop\r\nor by a slow process of getting us used to here a little and there a\r\nlittle more--we do not know yet.  What we do know is that he proposes to\r\ngovern this country by a huge economic group that used to go to Ottawa as\r\ndelegations; that in his opinion the real Capital of Canada is not\r\neconomically Ottawa, but the ground floor of the Grain Exchange Building\r\nin Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nWe may not all have been reared on the farm, but be it known to all of\r\nus, our natural gravitation is back to the land.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago also it was said that one large nation would Boss the\r\nworld; later that Soviets would do it.  Both the Boss nation and the\r\nSoviets seem to be reconsidering the contract.  The world is a perversely\r\ncomplicated technicality.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Crerar smiles when the Premier (by appointment) calls the\r\nAgrarians \"a dilapidated annex\" to the Liberals.  He thinks he knows\r\nbetter.  He smiles even more sarcastically when he sees Mackenzie King\r\nchortle over that amusing fiction.  He may have some use for King.  If\r\nthe Liberal leader will be reasonable he may permit him to merge his\r\nparty with the Agrarians.  If not he may threaten to rob him of Mr.\r\nLapointe and Quebec, and let him see how he will like that.\r\n\r\nLast winter I met Crerar in a Toronto hotel.  He had just been down east\r\nproclaiming for United Farmers in the Maritimes.  An ardent Crerarite who\r\nspends his life watching Ottawa closely said as the leader came up:\r\n\r\n\"Tom, your one best bet is to make an alliance with Lapointe.  That\r\ncombination could upset any other confederacy in Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nCrerar smiled--warmly.  He said nothing.  At lunch no doubt he discussed\r\nthis with his supporter.  The old ace of Quebec!  When will that home of\r\nrace Nationalism ever get into the hand of cards held by Crerar who would\r\ninundate Quebec with reciprocity?  Perhaps one E. C. Drury can tell.  He\r\nis talked about as the man whom Crerar may call to the Premiership in a\r\nCabinet of fourteen Ministers of Agriculture and one Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREMIER WHO MOWED FENCE-CORNERS\r\n\r\nHON. E. C. DRURY\r\n\r\n  MOWING FENCE-CORNERS.\r\n\r\n  A zig-zag old rack with its ivies and moss,\r\n    Just fifty-odd panels or so;\r\n  A wheat-field, a scythe and a boy his own boss;\r\n    He had the fence-corners to mow.\r\n\r\n  He slivered the whetstone clear out to the tip\r\n    Of his snake-handled, snubnosed old blade;\r\n  And he swung his straw hat with a sweep and a rip\r\n    With the sun ninety-four in the shade.\r\n\r\n  He thought of the water-jug cool as a stone\r\n    Right under a burdock's green palm,\r\n  By the leg of a fence-corner hickory half-grown,\r\n    Where the breeze always blew in a calm.\r\n\r\n  But the boss saw him loafing clear over the corn,\r\n    The next the boy heard was a shout;\r\n  And he wished for a moment he never was born\r\n    To mow all those fence-corners out.\r\n\r\n  Past the elder-bush blow it's five corners to mow,\r\n    To get to that burdock's green lug--\r\n  So he put on a spurt till the sweat blacked his shirt,\r\n    And he mowed his way in to the jug.\r\n\r\n  What cared the boy then for the boss in the corn\r\n    With a beaded brown jug at his feet,\r\n  While he pulled out the corn-cob as glad he was born\r\n    As the bobolink there in the wheat?\r\n\r\n  He unbuttoned his shirt and got on the top rail,\r\n    He hung his straw hat on the stake,\r\n  And he smiled to the hickory leaves' rustling tale,\r\n    As he gazed at that berry-bush brake.\r\n\r\n  Till chuck! went the scythe on a piece of old rail\r\n    That lifted clear out of its bunk;\r\n  And he said what he never had read in a tale,\r\n    To that innocent, rotten old chunk.\r\n\r\n  And then he heard something that never was sung,\r\n    That no bobolink could have said,\r\n  That never was rendered by pen or by tongue;\r\n    But it made his heart thump in his head,\r\n\r\n  As he let the scythe drop and he picked up the chunk,\r\n    And sneaked up as soft as a breeze,\r\n  And poked at the noise in that rotten rail's bunk\r\n    Till out came a bumble of bees.\r\n\r\n  Oh! the jug it was cool and the berries were red,\r\n    And sweet was the bobolink's strain;\r\n  But bumble-bee cups in a rotten rail's bed\r\n    Make a jug and a bobolink vain.\r\n\r\n  By noon at the nest there was only one bee,\r\n    And only one berry to pick,\r\n  And only one drink in the jug at the tree:\r\n    But that boy was as full as a tick.\r\n\r\n  They have torn the old zig-zag clear out of its snake,\r\n    And the bushes have gone up in fire;\r\n  The hickory stands but it's only a stake\r\n    To hold up a fiddle of wire.\r\n\r\n  The wires are strung tight for the fiddle is new,\r\n    And straight as a beam of the sun:\r\n  The plough slides along it, the wind whistles through,\r\n    And the fence-corner blue-grass is done.\r\n\r\n  The old mossy rails and green ivies are gone\r\n    With fifty grass crooks in a row--\r\n  But the bobolink sits on the wire and sings on--\r\n    The music he sang long ago.\r\n\r\n  And now 'mid the jostle and rush of the street,\r\n    That boy has his dreams in the day,\r\n  When he sits on the rail 'twixt the clover and wheat,\r\n    And mows out the fence-corner hay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever E. C. Drury whetted a scythe mowing fence corners he was, so\r\nfar as can be reasonably surmised, thinking about the tariff and the\r\nwaters of the Red Sea that swallowed up Pharaoh.  It may be a\r\ncoincidence, but it seems like fate, that he was born in the same year\r\nas the National Policy; the indignity of which was so great that he\r\nvowed to spend his life living it down.  He went to sleep with blue\r\nbooks and the Bible under his pillow.  He gave way to both.  He has\r\nnever gone back on either.  The iniquity of a tariff to him was part of\r\nthe moral law.  The more he exhorted at revival meetings and\r\nlocal-preached and led class-meetings, the more deeply he was convinced\r\nthat tariff-Tories are in constant need of economic salvation.  At\r\nthreshing bees I can fancy this broad-faced, dreamy-eyed, large-mouthed\r\nyoung \"Reformer\" who never was born to take life mentally easy, saying\r\nto himself as he shoved the stack straw past his boots, that the old\r\nboys talking so hard about elections knew nothing about economics; and\r\nhe wished to heaven that barn was all threshed out, so that he could\r\nget back home to read some more tariff statistics.\r\n\r\nThe Drury farm, hewn from the bush by his grandfather, cost the young\r\nman nothing but taxes and upkeep.  It gave him leisure in which to\r\nstudy the ills of farming.  What a blessing all farmers have not\r\nleisure!  Travelling up and down that peninsula between Huron and Erie,\r\nconstantly at some sort of \"Meeting,\" Drury could see \"Hard Times\" on\r\nalmost every telegraph pole.  The average farmer had a small lot, a\r\nheavy mortgage and a large family; scrub cattle, thin horses and poor\r\nhogs.  No doubt Drury read, when it came out, that amazing pamphlet of\r\nGoldwin Smith--Canada and the Canadian Question, in which the writer\r\nalleged that the Canadian farmer sold the best he produced and ate the\r\nculls.  Well, with hogs at $3 per cwt., oats 20 cents a bushel, hay $7\r\na ton, and wheat under a dollar, from stumpy little fields--the farmer\r\nin Drury's youth did well to escape cannibalism.\r\n\r\nTo know Drury, one must understand the oddly interesting epoch and\r\nregion in which he came up.  The men with whose sons he went to the\r\nvillage school were manufacturers first, farmers second.  Their raw\r\nmaterial was the hardwood bush; their factory the saw mill; their\r\ncommon carrier the Yankee schooner.  In my own bush days a few counties\r\nfurther down in that same peninsula, I recall heaps of white oak slabs\r\nin the forest which I was told were the remains of the timber-men who\r\nhad gone through buying and cutting out the oaks for square timber that\r\nfloated away in rafts, probably to build tramp steamers in England.\r\nThe bush farmer hired to wield the broad-axe on that oak was as much an\r\nindustrialist as any moulder in a foundry.  He would have fought with\r\nhis naked fists any agitator who proposed to interfere with that wages\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nAfter the oak was gone came the elm buyers, shrewd Americans who paid\r\nas much for a thousand feet of prime swamp elm as the pork buyer twenty\r\nmiles away paid for a cwt. of dead hog.  Mr. Drury must have known\r\nsomething about those friendly but niggardly Yankee dollars that saved\r\nmany a bush farmer from being sold for taxes.  He may have seen bolt\r\nmills go up and young men betwixt haying and harvest swagger down to\r\nthe docks to get 25 cents an hour loading elm bolts into the three-mast\r\nschooners.  He probably saw stave mills arise in which hundreds of\r\nyouths got employment while their fathers at home fought stumps, wire\r\nworms, drought and the devil to get puny crops at small prices.  He saw\r\nthe wagon-works and the fanning mill factory and the reaper industry\r\ncome up out of these timber products.  While he was a youth the farmers\r\nwere the first promoters of bigger towns, because the big town meant\r\nmore jobs for the young men whose father's acres were too few for the\r\nfamilies, and bigger markets close at hand for perishable products.\r\nThe farmers of that day would have tarred and feathered any\r\nrevolutionist who came preaching that a good market town was a wicked\r\nconspiracy of _bourgeoisie_ and should become a deserted village.\r\n\r\nYankee money and Canadian industries were the economics of Drury's\r\nboyhood.  If he was as good a Canadian then as he is now he must have\r\nhad more faith in the Canadian factory than he had in the American\r\npaymaster, or sometimes even in the Ontario farm.  There never was a\r\nbush farmer who would not have voted for a tariff that increased the\r\nprice of timber for the saw-mill.\r\n\r\nBy the time Drury was old enough to consider being a candidate for\r\nParliament, heaps of sawdust marked the grave of many a vanished saw\r\nmill.  Young men who could not get work in the near-by town drifted to\r\nHigh School, to college, to law and medicine and the pulpit; they went\r\nto the big cities across the border and got high wages; to the Canadian\r\nWest and got cheap land.  The counties of Western Ontario began to\r\ndecrease in man wealth as they increased in the wealth of agricultural\r\nindustry.  The schools that used to have boys sitting on the woodpile\r\nby the box stove shrank to about four scholars in a class.\r\nCongregations dwindled.  Little towns lost their mills and began to\r\nfeel like Goldsmith's Deserted Village.  Then came the age of farm\r\nmachinery, when the big towns had more overalls than the farms, and\r\nevery good farm began to be a sort of factory.\r\n\r\nAll this was meat and drink to E. C. Drury, who came to voting age with\r\nthe solemn conviction that though the fathers had worked hard, the sons\r\nwere not prosperous.  They paid too much for what they had to buy and\r\ngot too little for what they had to sell; a fate which seems to\r\novertake most of us in varying degree.  With stagnant local towns the\r\nmarkets for perishable products declined.  In the open markets of the\r\nworld, reached by long railway and steamship hauls, the Canadian\r\nfarmer's staple products were in competition with nations of cheap\r\nlabour.  Across the lake a nation of twelve times our population was\r\nretaliating against our protective tariffs by duties on Canadian grain,\r\ncattle and hogs.  The Tory party and the Canadian Pacific and the Bank\r\nof Montreal and the Canadian Manufacturers' Association were becoming\r\nBritish at the expense of the Canadian farmer.  At the back of all the\r\ngods of things as they are and ought not to be, stood the damnable,\r\ndesolating tariff that fattened the town and starved the farmer in\r\norder to bloat the banks and the manufacturer and the railways--under\r\nthe cloak of patriotism!  Heaven deliver us!  Was it not a Tory\r\nmanufacturer of stoves who said in Toronto that he would build a tariff\r\n\"as high as Hainan's gallows?\"  Was it not a Tory President of the\r\nC.P.R. who said he would have a tariff as high as a Chinese wall to\r\nkeep out the Yankees?  Was it not the President of a great Canadian\r\nbank who deserted the Liberal party when it sought to enact a measure\r\nof reciprocity?\r\n\r\nOn all hands Mr. Drury could see the evidence of a master conspiracy\r\nagainst the farmer, who was to become the helot of civilization.  He\r\ncould see it in his own barn as he reckoned the cost of his machinery,\r\nand over against that the price of what he had in the bins of his\r\ngranary and on the hoof outside.  That thousands of farmers voted and\r\ntalked Conservative proved the astonishing power of heredity.  That all\r\nfarmers did not become Liberals and make the Liberal party a solid\r\nrural party proved that even a man's depleted pocket cannot compete\r\nwith the traditions of his family.  Drury looked to Laurier to\r\nemancipate the farmer.  In vain.  Laurier created more farmers,\r\nthousands of them in the West; but he only enslaved them with the\r\nvoters' lists; the very party over which Drury had almost wept with joy\r\nwhen at the age of eighteen he had felt them like the armies of Israel\r\nsweeping out the scoundrels of the National Policy.\r\n\r\nThus his hope was no longer in Laurier, who knew nothing about the\r\nfarmer, nor dreamed that in the very West which he had put on the\r\npolitical map with his prosperity of imported people and borrowed\r\nmoney, there was arising a race that would repudiate him and his.\r\nDrury had a weather eye on the West.  There were farms in Simcoe county\r\nnow worked by old men whose sons had gone to that Promised Land.  In\r\nthe constant drift of the hired man and the farmer's son to the town\r\nand the city for shorter hours, higher wages and more amusement, he saw\r\nthe fluidity of labour, the first evidence that there was some common\r\nground between the farmer and the labour class.  Working in his own\r\nfields, driving his own teams, operating his own machinery, this\r\ncapitalistic labour-unionist of the soil said to himself that the\r\nfarmers of Canada were entitled not merely to representation in\r\nParliament, but to the organization of a class interest that should\r\ntake hold of the country's economic horns and turn it on to the right\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nIn the lonely furrow of the farm a man often thinks out conclusions\r\nthat are gloriously right in themselves, but in the chequered and\r\ncynical experiences of men in office tragically impossible.  Mr. Drury\r\nwas no stranger to Ottawa.  He had been there on deputations; and on\r\ntariff commissions; and each time he came back he had a stronger\r\ndetermination to go there some day as the voice of the more or less\r\nunited farmer against the tariff that had sterilized the Liberals.\r\n\r\nDrury was a rural Liberal.  He saw in the reciprocity campaign of 1911\r\nsome glimmer of hope that Liberalism might succeed without a\r\nrevolution.  The election settled that.  From then on to the war the\r\nphilosopher of Crown Hill bent himself to the deeper study of the one\r\nforce that now seemed to him to be left capable of breaking the\r\nnation's bondage.  He no longer had the fervent desire to see a new\r\ntown grow among the farms that he had when he was a youth.  Every\r\nbigger town, unless it had industries that could widen the farmer's\r\nlow-cost market, was a mitigated menace.  Every foundry and implement\r\nworks and furniture factory and boot industry making goods more or less\r\nfrom imported material, considerably with imported labour, and selling\r\nto the consumer at a normal price plus the duty, roused in Mr. Drury as\r\nmuch hostility as a natively kind and Christian character would permit.\r\n\r\nAnd at last he saw the predicted slump begin to come in the year 1913,\r\nwhen the boomster dodged the boomerang of inflated and speculative\r\nvalues; when east and west the farmers, crimped by high railway rates\r\nand cost of materials, machinery and labour, ceased to be the backbone\r\nof Canadian buying.\r\n\r\nAnd then the War.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be traced to the normal development of this Ontario\r\nCincinnatus, it was the War which made Drury.  But for the war he would\r\nhave bided his time to be elected to Ottawa on a straight tariff issue.\r\nThe war, backed by the man's religion and his tariff theology, drove\r\nhim to the Premiership of Ontario.\r\n\r\nThere were times during the war when, if Mr. Drury was as honest with\r\nhimself as he is about government, he must have reflected that the\r\nCanadian farmer was getting pretty well paid back in part of one\r\ngeneration for the wrongs and adversities suffered by generations ago.\r\nPork at $20 per cwt., oats at $1.50 a bushel, wheat fixed by the\r\nGovernment at $2.40 to keep it from bulling to more than $3--none of\r\nthese could have been economically justified by Mr. Drury except as an\r\nact of compensating Providence.  The farmer of all people as a class\r\nbenefited most, when he was driven to the worst labour hardship he ever\r\nhad by the terrific prices paid for war work, which robbed him of hired\r\nhelp almost at any price.  The higher the price and the scarcer the\r\nhelp, the more the Government clamoured for production.  The Ontario\r\nfarmer responded to the call.  He was no more a patriot to do it than a\r\nman was to buy Victory Bonds.  He was simply a profitee (we leave off\r\nthe r).\r\n\r\nAnd this was the first call of the war to which the farmers as a class\r\nmade a hearty response.  No doubt most farmers were better servants of\r\nthe nation in the furrow than in the trench.  But the time came when\r\nthey had to leave the furrows.  On top of the Government's most frantic\r\ncall for more production by the farmer came the Military Service Act,\r\nwhich refused to exempt him.  The call to the plough-handle came before\r\nthe election of 1917.  The call to the bayonet came afterwards in a\r\ncrisis unforeseen at the time of the election.  Drury himself had been\r\ndefeated as a conscriptionist Liberal candidate in 1917.  No farmer\r\ncould be in khaki and overalls at the same time.  There was no reason\r\ngiven for the drastic change of face except the message from the front\r\nthat more men were urgently needed or the West front was doomed.  It\r\nwas not even reckoned that a farmer conscripted after seed-time in 1918\r\ncould not possibly be of use in the trenches till long after the time\r\nwhen the fate of the West front would have been settled anyway.\r\n\r\nHence the ire of the agriculturist, driven now to become an agrarian.\r\nThe Ontario farmer made no distinction between the Unionist Government\r\nthat had conscripted the farmer, and the Ontario Conservative\r\nGovernment which supported Ottawa.  The farmer made up his mind\r\nwherever possible to defeat both the old line candidates.\r\n\r\nPremier Drury was the chief result.  He never would have been offered\r\nthe post but for the cleavage caused by the war.  The U.F.O. were not\r\nunanimous, and Drury was not anxious.  He had his eye on Ottawa.  But\r\nthere was nobody else who could unite the group with labour.  Drury had\r\nhimself been the first president of the U.F.O. and secretary of the\r\nCanadian Council of Agriculture; he was a thinker, something of a\r\nscholar, a futurist, and a good deal of a radical; and he could speak\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHe picked a Cabinet mainly of farmers.  He occupied more time drafting\r\nhis Cabinet than most farmers take to harvest a crop.  He was in a\r\nhurry, but he wanted nobody to suspect it.  He said little; wisely.\r\nThere was no occasion.  He had no mandate from the people.  He wanted\r\nsure-enough colleagues.  The men he chose were all novices.  The old\r\nline critics watched him with affected contempt.  They said Agriculture\r\nand Labour never could mix.  Drury went along.  No Cabinet had ever\r\nbeen so prayerfully hand-picked.  Labour must not get the idea that it\r\nwas merely being sopped for the support of twelve men in a House\r\nmajority of one.  There must be concession; common aims understood,\r\neven ahead of experience, when there was as yet no common policy.\r\n\r\nMr. Drury had been only a few hours sworn Premier of Ontario when he\r\nwas summarily turned out--not, however, from Office.  In company with a\r\nfarmer author friend who had been given the freedom of a certain small\r\nbut desirable Club and who wanted to show Mr. Drury one place where he\r\ncould have a quiet time of an evening, he went to have dinner.  As\r\nneither of the gentlemen was known to the housekeeping department a\r\nmember of the Club--a well-known newspaperman--was asked to inquire\r\ntheir identity.  The result was that the Premier of Ontario and his\r\nfriend left the Club, without dinner.\r\n\r\nThe next day the newspaperman looked over the shoulder of his\r\neditor-chief in office and said,\r\n\r\n\"Who is the important-looking man in the photograph?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came, \"Hon. E. C. Drury, Premier of Ontario.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" he said huskily, \"that's the man I turned out of the\r\nClub last night.\"\r\n\r\nDrury had the sense of humour to regard the matter as a joke on both\r\nthe newspaperman and himself.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the new Legislature was a spectacle.  Dignitaries and\r\njudges, professors and generals stood about the farmers--led by the\r\nfarmer-in-chief, morning-coated, carefully groomed, plainly nervous but\r\nsustained by the dignity of it all.  His voice was firm; his manner\r\nthat of a very circumspect bridegroom.  The old smug strut and\r\ncase-hardened pomp of legislature inaugurals was lacking.  An\r\nundercurrent of deep sincerity stayed many a tremorous hand.  Drury was\r\nthe least nervous of all.  I imagine that in the morning he had sung to\r\nhimself some good old fortifying hymn, like \"Rock of Ages.\"\r\n\r\nSince that day the Premier has learned that practical politics is a\r\ngame that taxes all a man's technique in Christianity.  Autocratic\r\nHydro and Mackenzie the loosening octopus; New Ontario preaching up the\r\nold plaint of secession; better roads and prodigal Mr. Biggs; what to\r\ndo with Education that Cody had not started to do; how to stave off\r\ncommissions on reform of the school system; the constant queues of\r\nmoral reformers; the new menace of the movies and the censorship farce;\r\nthe timber stealers; disconcerting Dewart and redundant Ferguson;\r\nreturned soldiers and khaki members; the Reds and the plain clothes\r\nmen; blustering Morrison, and the tyrannical U.F.O.----\r\n\r\nUntil the Premier, plain, homespun gentleman that he is, longed for\r\nFriday evening and the Crown Hill farm and the quiet little church in\r\nthe village, because one week at his desk took more out of him than a\r\nmonth in overalls.  And then to relieve his surcharged soul he made\r\nthat speech at Milverton in which he boldly proclaimed that he was\r\ngoing to head, not a mere group called the U.F.O., but a People's\r\nParty.  For this \"broadening out\" speech he got clods thrown at him by\r\nMorrison, and Burnaby put rails on the road to upset the Premier's\r\nbuggy, and the _Farmers' Sun_ tried to change the wheels on his rig so\r\nthat he would not be able to get home.  Worse than any the _Onlooker_,\r\nthat virile organ of no advertising and of the Meighen Government, said:\r\n\r\n\"The U.F.O. chose this man and dragged him out of his rural obscurity.\r\nIn common gratitude he should have stuck to their colours.  He should\r\nhave given fair warning of a change of heart, and indeed we think he\r\nought to have resigned.  When a man joins a political party he agrees\r\nto subordinate his ambitions and activities to the common good of that\r\nparty, and failing to do so honour demands that he should leave it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the Premier of Ontario twice made an\r\nappointment by request from the writer of this for the purpose of\r\ngetting a statement for the press as to what he meant to do about this\r\nwhole business of \"broadening out,\" twice failed to keep the\r\nappointment and later came out with the Milverton pronunciamento, we\r\nhave no hesitation in pointing out that:\r\n\r\nMr. Drury was not in rural obscurity.  The U.F.O. had no colours which\r\nMr. Drury had not helped to paint, for he was the first President the\r\nU.F.O. ever had.  He had no change of heart, because when he made an\r\nunstable coalition of the U.F.O. and the Labour party he entered into a\r\npact and covenant which the U.F.O. had never considered; he had already\r\n\"broadened out\" to drive Labour and Agriculture as a team and had\r\npretty well succeeded in doing it.  Mr. Drury did not join a political\r\nparty.  The U.F.O. was not a real party because it went into the\r\nelection of 1919 without a leader, and in order to get its platform\r\ntranslated into party it had to have Mr. Drury or somebody like him.\r\nAnd if Mr. Drury should resign from the head of the two groups which he\r\nalone has made into the semblance of a party, he would be recommended\r\nby Mr. Crerar to let his guardian take him to a lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nDrury has done much better than his critics expected he would do.  He\r\nhas been bold enough to keep Adam Beck from being the unelected Premier\r\nof Ontario, which is more than Sir William Hearst ever could do.  He\r\nhas made Government cost more than it ever did, though it is only\r\nreasonable bookkeeping to believe that part of the cost was incurred by\r\na Government over which he had no control.  He has begun to build\r\npublic highways which being originally a farmer's job should have been\r\ndone well, but up to the present has been on a smaller scale as bad a\r\ncase of wasting the public money as the railways of Canada ever\r\nperpetrated.  The cost of administration being a matter of either\r\nexperience or graft, it is probable that the Coalition will cut down\r\nthe cost when they get more experience.  The Chippewa Canal is one\r\nglaring instance of high labour cost which a Farmer Premier with Labour\r\ncolleagues did not presume to regulate.  If anybody knows what a day's\r\nwork is it should be the farmer; but the farmer in this case was not\r\nabsolutely free to express his opinions, because he depends upon Labour\r\nfor his voting majority in the House.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of referendum Mr. Drury has been an advocate instead of a\r\njudge.  He and his--notably the church-ridden Mr. Raney, who does not\r\neven smoke--are a dry lot.  They wanted Ontario to be bone dry and\r\ntherefore preferred to have the people vote either foolishly for the\r\niniquitous O.T.A. or fanatically for absolute prohibition.  Mr. Drury\r\nshould have taken the spark plug out of his Methodist car long enough\r\nto reflect that what keeps a man contented is going to keep him from\r\nstirring up trouble.  If the Government of enlightened and moral\r\nOntario had brought in a measure to create a referendum on the\r\nalternative of prohibition _vs._ effective government control of\r\nreasonable liquors, it might have less cause to be panicky over\r\nBolshevism.\r\n\r\nThe legislation to exempt from taxation houses costing less than a\r\ncertain amount looks like a pretty straight play for the Labour vote,\r\nand the propagation of a semi-Bolshevistic principle that unless\r\nchecked somewhere will exempt the many at the expense of the few.\r\n\r\nBut before Mr. Drury has the chance to be truly elected by the people\r\nof Ontario to carry on his People's Party, he hopes perhaps that he may\r\nhave a chance to be called to Ottawa.  It is freely rumoured that Mr.\r\nCrerar has no intention of taking the Premiership which the liberated\r\npeople of Canada are going to bestow upon him by virtue of one more\r\ngroup-coalition.  In which case he may invite Mr. Drury, who has given\r\na sparring exhibition of being a Premier, to succeed him.  Then we\r\nshall have the undemocratic farce of an appointive Premier all over\r\nagain--for the third time in three years.  And then--well, we shudder\r\nto think what is going to become of Mr. Drury's hitherto unimpeachable\r\nChristianity and of the economic welfare of a country which has as much\r\nright to modern factories as the bush farmer ever had to saw-mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEZEKIEL AT A LEDGER\r\n\r\nRT. HON. SIR GEORGE FOSTER\r\n\r\nSir George Foster is a genius.  The world forgives much to geniuses,\r\nbecause it lives by them.  Canada has tolerated a great deal in Foster\r\nfor the very good reason that no man except Laurier has for so long a\r\nperiod without interruption seemed so picturesquely necessary to our\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nIn his own temperamental way Sir George somewhat compensates Canada for\r\nnever having produced a Milton or a Bach.  One of his best speeches\r\nmight be made into blank verse or set to a fugue.  He illuminates life.\r\nDecade by decade he comes prancing down the vistas of our politics with\r\na vitality that is perfectly amazing.  And when some obituarist writes\r\nhis epitaph, \"Foster Mortuus Est,\" he promptly rubs it out and writes,\r\n\"Resurgam!\"\r\n\r\nThe first allusion I ever heard made to Sir George Foster was in 1889,\r\non a Sunday School excursion when a Grit lawyer superintendent spoke\r\nwith admiring deprecation of the then famous divorce case; adding, as\r\nmight be expected of a righteous Grit, that it was a pity so eminent an\r\nadvocate of prohibition should have so compromised, perhaps ruined, his\r\npolitical career.\r\n\r\nWell, the compromise has lasted a long time and the ruin seems to be\r\nlong overdue.  Public sentiment over both temperance and divorce has\r\nsomewhat shifted.  In 1889, when virtue shuddered over marrying\r\ndivorced women, drunkards were being made by hundreds in any town under\r\nthe very nose of the church.  In 1921 when Parliament moves to\r\npopularize divorce, public sentiment not only abolishes the bar, but\r\nvotes bone dry on the eve of an artificial millennium.\r\n\r\nA man who for some years has wanted the Ministry of Trade made the\r\nremark in a magazine article that if he had Sir George Foster in his\r\nemploy as a salesman he would have him discharged for incompetence.\r\nThat man forgets that a genius is not born to sell goods.  There were\r\ntimes in the war when less genius and more business in Trade and\r\nCommerce would have been better for Canada.  Foster was almost seventy\r\nwhen the war began; a pretty old man to act as the chief business\r\nmanager for a nation at war.  His department was the economic backbone\r\nof the Administration.  The nearer Canada got to total conscription of\r\nresources, the more Foster's work should have towered into the blue.\r\nTrade and troops were the life of the nation.  Hughes, White, Borden,\r\nRowell, Meighen, were all shoved into greater eminence by the work they\r\ndid in the war; Foster was no bigger or more potent a figure in war\r\nwork or any other kind of work when peace was signed than he was in\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nHe never was a great executive even at his portfolio under Macdonald in\r\nthe early '80's.  He has always been a prophet.  Public speech is his\r\nbesetting passion.  He could rise anywhere and translate logic and\r\neconomics into ethical emotion.  No man in Canada felt the war more\r\nintensely.  But Trade was not a matter of emotion; or of oratorical\r\nperiods; or the right hand descending upon the left.  It was a matter\r\nof urgent and colossal business.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, talking to the war budget, he declaimed against patronage.  He\r\nhad done the same thing in 1910 just as ably when he was the pot\r\ncalling the kettle black.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" he said, \"that in the white light of the present struggle the\r\ntwo parties will agree to do away with the evil.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"white light\" was more intent on doing away with the parties\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the same speech:\r\n\r\n\"When the trenches call for munitions and supplies, when the blood of\r\nthe country is oozing from its veins in the struggle to preserve its\r\nideals and its liberties, when those who are at home are contributing\r\nwith generous self-sacrifice and without murmur or repining, I say that\r\nto me as a member of the Government, to you as supporters of the\r\nGovernment, and to you, gentlemen opposite, as a part of the great body\r\nwhich represents the people of this Dominion, the call comes to cut off\r\nevery unnecessary expenditure, to refuse every improper demand.  It is\r\nour business to administer the funds of the people with perfect\r\neconomy, and to devote ourselves to the one sole purpose of prosecuting\r\nthis war to a successful and final conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, he spoke like a prophet when he riddled the blind optimism of\r\nthe prosperity pack.  At that time Canada had a favouring balance of\r\n$200,000,000 just two years after a heavy ledger against us.\r\n\r\n\"The Optimist speaks of the unexampled prosperity that is to follow the\r\nwar.  I would like to think so, but I can't.  The prediction of a\r\nMontreal newspaper that Canada will have from twelve to fifteen million\r\ninhabitants within three years after the war is a mischievous\r\nexaggeration.  The first trying period of readjustment will come\r\nimmediately after the actual fighting ceases and an armistice is\r\ndeclared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEzekiel was profoundly right up till the last prophecy.  The Minister\r\nof Trade, with all his great ability to analyze trade, had not mastered\r\neconomics.  Neither had the President of a great Canadian bank when he\r\nsaid before the armistice, that merchants with empty shelves and able\r\nto buy cheap goods would be in luck.  It was a bad time for prophets.\r\n\r\nHowever, for a man who aimed at so many nails, Sir George had a good\r\naverage of hitting.  But while he was talking so much, and in Europe so\r\nlong, the biggest-business administration of which he was the chief\r\nwent along on its own more or less mechanical momentum.  By 1917 Canada\r\nhad a total export trade of more than half a billion; with a possible\r\nyearly munition order of 500 millions--no thanks to the Minister of\r\nTrade.  No nation in the world exported so much from so few people.  No\r\nMinistry of Trade had such a record.  Sir George knew exactly what it\r\nall meant.  He was used to analytical surveys.  But one fails to\r\nremember that at any period he issued from his office, the trade centre\r\nof the Dominion, any statements that shewed him to be more than a\r\npuzzled commentator on the riddle of trade, usually between speeches\r\nand journeys.  Sir George never did have executive patience for the\r\nmastery of detail.  In this case he did not even convince the people\r\nthat he had sized up the great general outlines, so fascinating because\r\nso profoundly unusual.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1916, Sir George issued in his weekly Trade Bulletin a\r\nresounding Call To Action for a business conference at Ottawa of all\r\nparties interested for the purpose of pulling the country's industries\r\nand organizations into one big _ensemble_ for getting back to peace.\r\nThat \"Call\" was published in one paper illustrated by a picture of Sir\r\nGeorge--in the climax of a speech.  A few months later a political\r\nwriter was in Ottawa, and when he came back he wrote an article about\r\nthe Foster Conference.  The following extract shows what he thought of\r\nit:\r\n\r\nIn Ottawa, last week, I met a big bear of a Canadian westerner.  He had\r\njust arrived from Toronto.  He was all smiles, all energy and\r\nenthusiasm, and he was looking for the Minister of Trade and Commerce,\r\nSir George E. Foster.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what I want him for,\" he said.  \"I want to go up and shake\r\nhands with a real live man.  That's what I want.  I read his message\r\n'bout getting together, and it sure set me thinking.  I'm strong for\r\nthis Conference scheme.  I'm going to back it for all I'm worth and do\r\nmy darndest to help a real, live statesman to pull off a big deal.\r\nDamn if I care whether he is a Tory.  My middle name is--Boost!  I want\r\nto help.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked up to the Department of Trade and Commerce together.\r\n\r\n\"Just what line of industry are you interested in?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Boilers--steam boilers.  Vancouver.  Little Van-cou-ver.  That's my\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I may ask, what is your idea about this Business Man's\r\nConference?  What do you think ought to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?  Why, I don't know yet.  That's what I'm coming to see Foster\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later I met the boiler-maker coming away from the Department of\r\nTrade and Commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"everything clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear?\" he roared.  \"Clear?  Why, man alive! that fellow Foster's away\r\nin the West with some Dominion Royal Commission, making speeches or\r\nsomething, and back there\"--nodding toward the Department of Trade and\r\nCommerce--\"nobody home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't they explain it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.  They explain that Sir George is away and nothing definite can\r\nbe done.  I asked 'em when the conference would be called and they said\r\nthat was indefinite.  Then I said where?  And they thought somewhere in\r\nOttawa.  Why, all that fellow Foster made was a speech.  That's all.  A\r\nspeech!  Now what the h---- good will a speech do to help me and help\r\nthe rest of us manufacturers to keep from getting swamped after this\r\nwar?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade in Canada during the war was of vastly more practical\r\nsignificance than the old fiscal idea of Empire of which Sir George had\r\nbeen such a protagonist when he stumped England for Chamberlain in\r\n1903.  But he never seemed able to grasp it as clearly even in a\r\nspeech.  I don't know which seems to me now the greater speech; that on\r\nthe Chamberlain mirage to the Toronto Empire Club when he elevated\r\nfiscal statistics into a pageant of economic emotion; or his speech on\r\nthe war, I think in 1916, when he lifted his thin spectral figure into\r\na sublime paroxysm of ethical appeal, corralled all opposing arguments\r\ninto a corner and flogged the life out of them in a great message to\r\nawakened humanity.  The comparison scarcely matters except to show that\r\nin fifteen years of great Foster speeches alas for the prophets!--it\r\nwas not the fiscal Empire of Chamberlain that had leaped to the war.\r\n\r\nStill more startling to Sir George, the economics of war riddled to\r\nbits the old economics of Empire.  In 1917 he was compelled to forget\r\nthat a tariff was implied in the Ten Commandments and to consent for\r\nall necessary purposes to remove trade restrictions across the border.\r\nThat was after the United States had declared war.  The high priest of\r\nprotection himself invented a phrase \"economic unit\" to express North\r\nAmerica.  He wanted markets to find their own levels by their own\r\nroutes.  He no longer had any fear of Canada being Americanized.\r\nCanada's nationhood was already defined in the trenches more than ever\r\nit had been in tariffs.  In Sir George's phrase the food producers of\r\nNorth America were to become one vast international group.  When Foster\r\nwas \"Yea\" to Macdonald in 1887 and 1891, before he became \"Amen\" to\r\nChamberlain in 1903, this economic unity was called continentalism,\r\nwhich to Foster was the mother of annexation, and Free Trade Liberals\r\nwere traitors to the Empire.\r\n\r\nEconomic unity, however, meant far more than Sir George intended it to\r\nmean.  He admitted the principle of free-trade only in production.  In\r\nspite of tariffs North America became, not only a vast group of\r\nproducers, but a huge family of consumers.  Every Victory Loan raised\r\nmoney that was spent in once more paying wages and buying materials for\r\nwar production in Canada.  Every time that money went round the circle,\r\nprices for many of the staple commodities went higher.  The Department\r\nof Trade registered a tremendous increase in the cash value of exports\r\neven when the bulk value changed very little.  The more loans \"put over\r\nthe top,\" the more money there seemed to be.  The more hazardous\r\nshipping became through submarines, the greater the scarcity, and the\r\ndemand--and the price paid.  Sir George witnessed this phenomenon: the\r\nfewer producers left by conscription on the land, in the mines, in the\r\nfactories, the more Canada was able to export--in cash values.\r\n\r\nThis must have given a good Tory economist loss of sleep.  No man could\r\nhave analyzed the paradox more ably than Sir George.  But so far as we\r\ncan recollect, he published no illuminating bulletins from his\r\nDepartment to tell us about it.  How we should have enjoyed his master\r\nmind elucidating the phenomenon of a continent being gradually denuded\r\nof goods and flushed with money; of prices inexorably mounting; of\r\nmoney hungering for goods; of fabulous wages for munition-making and\r\nanything else that could be scaled up to meet the competition unloading\r\nthemselves into Victory Bonds at a sure profit, and the surplus into\r\ncommodities most of which were not made in Canada and must therefore\r\ncome from the United States.  What a prophetic commentary it would have\r\nmade on the \"buyers' market\" which followed the armistice.  What\r\nwonderful reading it would have made if Sir George had issued replies\r\nto those commercial newspaper editors over the border who rushed\r\njubilating into print to say with fabulous statistics that Canada was\r\nnow the heaviest customer that nation had.  How we should have liked to\r\nhear officially from the Minister of Trade how Broadway was infecting\r\nthe country, luxuries reeling in argosies over the dry land to Canada,\r\nand Canada buying herself bankrupt on the exchanges; and that though\r\nthere were powerful economic reasons for it all, we had better enlist\r\nin an army of economy instead of being conscripted later by the\r\nsuper-tariff on luxuries and the luxury tax.\r\n\r\nBut the Minister of Trade confined himself to growling that we should\r\nall wear patches and old clothes.  Which was one good reason why many\r\npeople did not.  It was easy for Sir George to wear patched trousers if\r\nhe felt like so doing.  He would have been merely picturesque, like\r\nthose ragged prophets of old.  Most of us still had to invest in some\r\nsort of decoration.  Anyhow a large number of people had the money to\r\nspend; and the more they spent the more they approved of self-denial in\r\nother people.\r\n\r\nThis problem of American penetration is big enough at any time here.\r\nThe Department of Trade is the place where it is most clearly\r\nunderstood.  We are constantly warned about the danger, not only to our\r\nCanadian dollar, but to our national independence if we persist in\r\nimporting motor cars, fashionable footwear, party gowns and lingerie\r\nand hats, art furniture, home decorations, phonographs, moving\r\npictures, and magazines.  But we go on doing it; because Canada,\r\nwhether in war or peace, fails to produce a great many things that\r\npeople like to have and to wear and to go about in; and for those that\r\nshe does we are charged the foreign price plus the duty and more; so\r\nthat in many and many a case it has been found more economical to buy\r\nthe article from catalogue, paying the duty and the express charges.\r\n\r\nHas Sir George ever enlightened us about this?  Has he ever tried to\r\ninform the Canadian manufacturer that if he expects to hold our\r\nallegiance even under a more or less protective tariff, he must refrain\r\nfrom charging the consumer all the traffic and more than the consumer\r\nwill stand?  We fail to remember; even when we recollect that on thus\r\nand such an occasion somewhere in the Empire he made some glorious\r\npatriotic speech.  On a subject which causes many Canadians to explode,\r\noften with ill-considered accusation of \"the Yankees,\" our greatest\r\nmaker of pure and applied speeches seldom has a word to say.  But he\r\nknows.  Sir George Foster knows our economic subjugation by the 12 to 1\r\nmethod, even under a tariff.  Alas! he hails from the Maritimes, a land\r\nof great people, of constructive Canadians who have too often been in\r\nabsolute economic need of more of that sort of subjugation.\r\n\r\nThen there was the never-dead dragon of high prices for everything,\r\nwhich our St. George made no real attempt to spear.  That is a long\r\nstory.  It was his department which furnished the Food Controller, the\r\nduties which the Trade Department could not discharge.  Well remembered\r\nare the evangelical injunctions of the Controller to consume perishable\r\nand export other products; to live on garden truck grown in back yards\r\nand corner lots so that grain and butter and bacon and eggs and oatmeal\r\nmight run the submarine blockade on the high seas.  There was no fault\r\nto find with this, so long as it was economy.  But heaven knew what\r\narmies of housewives, already desperate from lack of help, were\r\ndragooned into making their kitchens amateur canning factories where\r\nthey wasted good fruit along with tragically expensive sugar in jars\r\nthat approximated the cost of cut glass.  And after all the slavery and\r\nthe self denial, butter and eggs that were not shipped abroad because\r\nthere was no room in munition ships to carry them, vanished\r\nmysteriously in the lower price season into some limbo known as\r\ncold-storage, only to emerge when it suited the storage barons at\r\nprices as high as were paid in Europe.  No doubt there is an economic\r\nphilosophy in cold-storage just as there is in hydro-power.  But we\r\nhave always supposed its virtue was in taking care of a perishable\r\nsurplus, so that when there is a scarcity the surplus can be released\r\nat a reasonable profit.\r\n\r\nDid the able Minister of Trade ever stoop to enlighten us with the\r\neconomics of this?  If so, the recollection has faded.\r\n\r\nThere is at any time, whether in peace or war, a great function for the\r\nDepartment of Trade to perform in the matter of what is the reasonable\r\ncost of any commodity in general demand.  But no Trade Department in\r\nthis country has ever done it.  There is always plenty of time for the\r\nconsideration of new markets, the plotting of new trade routes and the\r\nplanning of mercantile marine for export; all very well, and if we are\r\nto pay our bills by exports, very necessary.  But the common consumer\r\nhas many a time, long before the war and often since, found himself in\r\nthe jaws of a nutcracker in the shape of some combine or trust or\r\nconfederacy of middlemen; and if there was any sphere of government to\r\ndeal with these things it was the great Department of Trade.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with party politics.  Any party up to date has\r\nbeen capable of neglecting the people in these matters.  But it is\r\nquite as important as the abolition of patronage.\r\n\r\nWe have ceased to expect any such function from a Minister so old, so\r\neloquent, so Imperially-inspired as Sir George Foster.  There is always\r\nsomething else to do.  The party must be led in the House.  Sir George\r\nwas the House leader.  Magnificent!  No man ever rose at a desk in\r\nParliament who could more superbly play upon the bigotries and the high\r\npatriotic emotions of even a remnant party.  The man is a genius.\r\nThere must be the valley of dry bones for Ezekiel.  And the bones must\r\ncome together and walk.  Sir Robert Borden on such occasions was a mere\r\ninterested gargoyle.  Patriotism demanded that the party's desks be\r\nthumped.  Sir George saw that they were thumped without stint.\r\n\r\nTwice during the Opposition period Sir George was dead and buried by\r\nthe Grits; once over the Union Trust land investigation; again in a\r\nlibel suit which he lost to the _Globe_ when Rowell was against him.\r\nNone of these things defeated the able author of Resurgam! who was made\r\nMinister of Trade, went for a six-months' journey in the Orient trying\r\nto convert the yellow races from rice to Canadian flour, and afterwards\r\ngot his title.  So when the people, in 1917, asked Ezekiel for a\r\nprophecy, the Minister of Trade stoically advised them to eat less,\r\nsave more, waste nothing, wear what their grandmothers wore if\r\npossible, and hope for the best.  In the matter of fixing prices Sir\r\nGeorge had as much wisdom as most, though he made a very awkward\r\nattempt to adjust the price of wheat and only then at the instigation\r\nof the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe world by this time was full of upsetting anomalies to Sir George.\r\nEven government was perverted.  He had no desire for Unionism; to sit\r\nat Council with even win-the-war Liberals--once plain Grits.  It needed\r\npolitical philosophy to make colleagues of such men as Calder, the Grit\r\nenemy of Toryism in the West, Crerar, the avowed apostle of free-trade,\r\nSifton, the Alberta mystery man, and Rowell, who had won the libel suit\r\nagainst him for the Globe.  It was not to be expected that so complete\r\nand historic a Tory as Sir George could at first easily regard such men\r\nas anything but interlopers, even though he admitted their strength in\r\nthe Coalition.  One can imagine Meighen making up to his old trade\r\nenemy Carvell, but not Foster making overtures to Rowell.\r\n\r\nBut the vital element was gone out of the Administration, and Sir\r\nGeorge had to admit it.  Cold and repellent as he has always seemed in\r\npolitics, without a crony or even a man who cared to make him a\r\nconfederate, he has never been a man of implacable resentment.  He was\r\nyet to regard Rowell as a real man, worthy his confidence.\r\n\r\nA newspaperman sent to Osgoode Hall to report the Globe libel suit for\r\nan Ottawa Liberal paper relates how the night of the conclusion of the\r\ntrial he met Mr. Foster at the Toronto Station.  The reporter had\r\nalready wired the decision of the Court adverse to Mr. Foster, who had\r\nnot even taken the trouble to inquire what it was.  The two chatted\r\namiably on the train and met the next morning in Ottawa.  On his way\r\nhome Mr. Foster saw the Liberal bulletin at the newspaper office.  A\r\nfew days later he met the scribe.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" he said, genially, shaking hands, \"why didn't you tell me about\r\nthat decision?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I really thought you knew, and I didn't care to hurt your\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nThe member for North York laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Feelings!\" he repeated.  \"You are the first Grit that ever said I had\r\nany.\"\r\n\r\nA prominent Liberal described to the writer the exit of Mr. Foster from\r\nthe House after the Royal Commission investigation into the Union Trust.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Foster,\" he said eloquently, \"went together down the\r\nterrace in a fog of rain, into the shadow of the night, under one\r\numbrella.  And I said to myself as they went, dejected and pitiful,\r\n'Well, that's the final exit of Foster from political life.'\"\r\n\r\nThe author of Resurgam knew better.  He could always somehow come back\r\non the stepping stones of a dead self.  Something made him feel that\r\nwithout him the Conservative party would have been like the Liberals\r\nwithout Laurier, or in an earlier day his own party minus the old chief\r\nMacdonald.  He was almost right.\r\n\r\nOne other episode illustrates how spontaneously the emotional aspect of\r\nthings sometimes sways this cold politician who never could lead a\r\nparty.  When the Premier by request called a caucus of his Union\r\nsupporters for the purpose of discovering what could be done with the\r\nCoalition to make it a party, it was not the Premier who held the\r\nfloor, but Sir George, who made a long passionate speech upon the\r\nvicissitudes of men who--like the Premier and himself--had carried the\r\nburden and the heat of the political day.  When Foster had finished,\r\nthere were tears on case-hardened faces and the caucus adjourned.\r\nAsked later for a copy of his great speech, Sir George said he had not\r\neven prepared any notes; when he went to the caucus he had not intended\r\nmaking any such speech; he did not now remember what he had said.\r\n\r\nCan we call such a man anything but a genius?  As Minister of Trade he\r\nmay be a poor salesman.  He is not less a poor salesman of his party,\r\nhis country, or his big original belief in the Empire, whatever form of\r\ngovernment it might become, or of his birthright to spend his\r\ntremendous talent in public service rather than in private gain.  And\r\nhe has been for almost a generation the most interesting personality in\r\nthe ranks of the Conservative party.\r\n\r\nThere is but one other politician in America with the political\r\nvitality of Sir George Foster.  \"Uncle Joe\" Cannon is the man.  In\r\nWashington Cannon is regarded as a miracle because he was once the\r\nautocrat of Congress and is still a member of the House and a very old\r\nman.  Sir George Foster is almost as old a man and has been in public\r\nservice much longer.  He has held portfolios under all the Conservative\r\nPremiers that Canada ever had--Macdonald, Thompson, Abbott, Bowell,\r\nBorden, Meighen.  There have been times in the shuffles of these men\r\nwhen for ability he, rather than Abbott or Bowell or Borden, should\r\nhave been Premier.  But there was always a fatal obstacle in the\r\npersonality of the man whose leadership always depended upon making a\r\ngreat speech.  When he was first Minister under Macdonald, a lad named\r\nArthur Meighen was getting ready to attend a High School.  Could that\r\nMinister and that lad have been introduced, would Ezekiel have\r\nprophesied that in 1920 he would be holding office under the lad,\r\nPremier of Canada?\r\n\r\nAnomalies like these are the rule in a life of a man so unusual as Sir\r\nGeorge, who is now a Senator.  Even in the Senate he is not dead; for\r\nin Ezekiel, 37th chapter, it is written, \"Son of man, can these bones\r\nlive?   And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HALO OF BILLIONS\r\n\r\nHON. SIR THOMAS WHITE\r\n\r\nSir Thomas White was the world's only continuous Finance Minister for\r\nthe whole period of the war--and after; when nobody else cared to have\r\nhis job, and Sir Thomas did.  He seduced billions of patriotic dollars\r\nout of the pockets of this country and smiled as he did it.  No man in\r\nCanada was so exquisitely fitted to the task of making an average\r\ndollar burn a hole in a man's pocket in order to do its bit.  It gave\r\nhim \"the pleasure that's almost pain\" to feel that no man except Henri\r\nBourassa or an Eskimo could escape the snare of a Victory Loan\r\nadvertisement prepared by Sir Thomas and his committees of ad-men and\r\nbrokers.  Never before on this continent had a nation been so\r\nadvertised into patriotism.  In England some expert had done it for\r\nKitchener's Army.  But it was easier to recruit England, with 30\r\nmillions of people within the area of our maritime provinces, than to\r\nmobilize billions from a vast emptiness like Canada.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the divinity which keeps governments from\r\nwrecking nations had somehow picked the right man for this stupendous\r\ntask.  Sir Thomas had a quality of mind and a political experience\r\nwhich made it possible for him to pull the last dollar for victory.  In\r\nthe war annals of Canada he will have a halo of billions, while Sam\r\nHughes has one of bayonets.  He mobilized our financial resources by a\r\nsystem that stopped only short of conscription.\r\n\r\nI seldom see Sir Thomas standing at a street corner when I do not feel\r\nlike urging him to run along and attend to his office and not to be\r\nlosing time.  He seems to belong to that cold group of men whose time\r\nis naturally money.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 I asked Mr. White in Ottawa for an interview.  He appointed an\r\nhour when I might see him.  As soon as I entered the office he began to\r\ntalk.  The ease and fluency of his conversation amazed me.  No other\r\nMinister of that Cabinet could have been so suave and entertaining.\r\n\r\n\"Er--with regard to the question of railway fin----?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw the question coming in a sort of parabolic curve and he dodged\r\nit.  By a neat evasion he got the topic switched to sociology, from\r\nthat to philosophy, to heredity, literature, journalism, art, and\r\nfinally prenatalism.  Every effort I made to probe him on public\r\nfinance was met by some calm and smiling barrage of eclectic interest.\r\nFor an hour we played conversational pingpong in the most amiable\r\nstyle.  And when Mr. White urbanely confessed that he liked everybody\r\nin the House of Commons, even \"Bob\" Rogers and Dr. Pugsley, it was time\r\nfor the interviewer to go, before so charmed a Utopia should vanish\r\nlike a film on a screen, and to conclude that the Finance Minister of\r\nCanada was no novice in a certain species of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nTime made some heavy changes in him.  A press gallery observer, asked\r\nby a certain Canadian periodical to name a possible successor to Sir\r\nRobert Borden four years before the Premier's resignation, picked Sir\r\nThomas whom he said he had watched turn grey and careworn in office,\r\nsedulous at his desk, always busy, never at ease.  Yet in 1912 he could\r\nlecture hon. gentlemen opposite seasoned in political intrigues as\r\nthough he, himself, had discovered some new coefficient in politics.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas White has always been a political emergency, a sort of\r\nadministrative occasion.  For real politics he was never meant.  For\r\ngovernment by business he had great aptitude.  To him government is big\r\nbusiness, and the human side of democracy a sealed book.  He has an\r\nalmost exquisite sense of prerogative.  His equilibrium is adjusted to\r\nthe niceties of a seismographic instrument.  Yet he has never held\r\nhimself aloof, and is not commonly proud.\r\n\r\nThere is an idle story that near the end of his term in office he went\r\nto a bank teller's wicket--being in urgent temporary need of a little\r\ncommon money--and presented a cheque.  On being courteously reminded by\r\nthe teller that he had not brought the customary identification, he\r\nblandly announced, \"I am the Finance Minister of Canada.\"  The manner\r\nin which the Minister spoke is said to have left no doubt in the\r\nteller's mind that he was indeed the very man whose photograph had\r\nappeared in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThere is also a little story that during one of the Victory Loan\r\nconferences in Ottawa, one of his older associates in newspaper work\r\npolitely called him Sir Thomas, and that the Minister replied, \"Oh,\r\nforget it!  Call me Tom.\"\r\n\r\nThe first may be fiction.  The second is a fact.  But the number of men\r\nwho without invitation would call him Tom, is not very extensive.\r\n\r\nFrom his youth up Tom White had a powerful capacity for ordered work.\r\nThere was \"a time to work and a time to play, a time to laugh and a\r\ntime to weep.\"  Nor did he acquire this from Sir Joseph Flavelle, with\r\nwhom he was so long and intimately associated.  He had it from the\r\ncradle, which he must have left at the appointed time with some\r\nimpatience at too much rocking.  As a student at the University, as a\r\nlaw student at Osgoode, as a barrister, as reporter on the _Telegram_,\r\nas an employee in the Toronto Assessment Department, he had always a\r\nsort of mathematical regard for the diligence that makes a man fit to\r\nstand before kings, and the sensation of a superbly pigeon-holed mind.\r\n\r\nBy heredity Sir Thomas was labelled a Liberal, and at the time of the\r\nTaft-Fielding reciprocity junta he sat on the edge of his political bed\r\npulling the court-plaster off.  Next morning, without a single new grey\r\nhair in his head, he found himself a Conservative.  The Liberal regime\r\nof shipping in people and booming up speculative towns on the prairies\r\nwas a good thing for any Trust.  But when the Government began to\r\nbarter its preserve for another lease of life, Mr. White decided that\r\nit was time for a change.  When he quit the National Trust to take on a\r\ntrust for a nation he was a new-born Conservative, and in the eyes of\r\nthe new Premier a lovely child.  And as Finance Minister in a Tory\r\nGovernment he became the real author of Coalition.\r\n\r\nMr. White took into the Finance Department the atmosphere and the\r\ntechnique of the fiduciary corporation.  Hence he was never able to\r\nread himself into the life of the country, never became more than a\r\nsuperficial master of its political forces, never rallied men about him\r\nin a great effort to save anything but a financial situation, and never\r\nlost a superb sense of himself.  The fact that without ever having been\r\nelected to Parliament or Legislature, or even a County Council, he\r\ncould walk into what is usually regarded as the most important\r\ndepartment of administration in any country, is a proof that government\r\nas big business was more important to him than politics as experience.\r\n\r\nThe average portfolio is handed to a politician, not because he knows\r\nanything about the matter in hand, but because he is a good politician,\r\na big enough man to represent some electoral area, and may be left to\r\nlearn his public job after he gets it.  Such is democracy.  White was a\r\ntyro in politics and public administration.  But he did know finance.\r\nWhen Laurier picked editor Fielding from Nova Scotia to look after the\r\nBudget he chose a good deal of a genius.  Mr. Fielding was a master of\r\ntariffs and of inspiring fiscal speeches outside the House.  He had\r\nalmost a Gladstonian faculty for making statistics scintillate with\r\nhuman interest.  He had made a survey of the country on tariff for\r\nrevenue; and he usually had a bookkeeping surplus at a time when he\r\npractically boasted on the platform of what it cost to run the country.\r\nMuch thanks to him the Liberals had given Free Trade a profoundly\r\nrespectable burial, with Michael Clark, headmaster of the Manchester\r\nSchool in Canada, as chief mourner.\r\n\r\nBut the ledgers of Canada looked to be in a bad way to Mr. White.  \"The\r\ncost of high living\" had been demonstrated by the Liberal Government\r\nsome time before James J. Hill coined the phrase.  Laurier monuments to\r\nhigh living were dotted all over the country in the shape of armouries,\r\npost offices, customs houses, docks, courthouses, the Quebec Bridge,\r\nand vast systems of unpopulated railways.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. White's sensitive finger came to that prodigal item in the\r\npublic ledger he had almost excuse, in spite of his pre-knowledge of\r\nthe business, for curling up like a cutworm.  His knowledge of banks\r\nand their customers was very extensive.  He had dealt with those banks.\r\nThe ex-manager of the National Trust had long known that Canada was\r\noverbuilt with railways and going-to-be-bankrupt towns.  The orgy of\r\nexpansion whose familiar figure was the prodigal with the scoop shovel\r\nin the gold bin by the open window with a huge hole in the ground\r\nbeneath, was just about at the crest of its master carousal\r\n[Transcriber's note: carousel?]; and the transcontinental railways with\r\ntheir entails of cash and land grants and guaranteed bonds was the\r\nthing that gave the new Minister the greatest concern of the lot,\r\nthough he never said so.  An ex-Cabinetarian who used to agree with Sir\r\nThomas in politics still stoutly alleges that the 1911 \"bolt\" of the\r\nfamous 18 Liberals, of whom Sir Thomas was one of the leaders, was a\r\ntactical manoeuvre to save the Canadian Northern from bankruptcy by\r\nreciprocity.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas should have made the railways his first drastic item of\r\nreorganization.  Here was a Verdun for the Finance Minister to take.\r\nBut for two years while the railway cataclysm was coming he went along\r\nwith business as usual.  It would have been less of a burden to unload\r\nthat railway bankruptcy in 1913 than it was during the stress of after\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nBut of course the Finance Minister was only the chief subordinate in\r\nthe Administration.  Time would force the railways to terms.  The war\r\nand war business came faster than the time.  Sir Thomas probably\r\ndreaded the public ownership in which he has never profoundly believed.\r\nIn conversation with the President of the Canadian Pacific he\r\npractically admitted that a Government cannot compete with a great\r\ncorporation in operating a railway.  But in 1912, on the principle that\r\nan egg hatches into a chicken, he must have foreseen that national\r\nownership of half Canada's railways would be thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nIt is not explicitly known what are Sir Thomas White's opinions about\r\nthe Government ownership of railways; but one can easily imagine what\r\nhe would have said prior to 1911 to any proposal of any Government to\r\nbegin owning and operating banks and trust companies.  And as\r\nGovernment is the owner of the Royal Mint in Canada and does its own\r\ncoining of the metals used in our currency, it would seem to be vastly\r\neasier for a Government to own banks and loan companies than to own and\r\noperate transportation systems.  Sir Thomas would scarcely deny that.\r\nHe is too shrewd in experience.  It is one thing for a municipality to\r\nown street railways, because all the streets are automatically part of\r\na city's property.  It is quite another matter for Government to own\r\nand operate railways, because the routes of these highways and the\r\nmachinery necessary to conduct traffic are not naturally the property\r\nof a Government, which exercises its power chiefly through the\r\nregulation of rates and the functions of the Railway Commission.\r\n\r\nOne imagines that Sir Thomas sincerely hoped that the railways built\r\nfrom cash borrowed on Government guaranteed bonds, and by direct loans\r\nfrom the national exchequer would some time develop business enough to\r\npay their own way.  But it is not remembered that he held any\r\nconferences with the Minister of Railways to prepare a public statement\r\non this question.  Both these Ministers had troubles enough without\r\ncreating more.  The country was on the crest of a wave whose trough was\r\nnot far ahead.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas had made but one really constructive budget speech when the\r\ninevitable slump began to come.  But as yet he seemed to be rather\r\ncharmed with the novelties of Parliament and the ironies of preparing\r\nto win elections.  The war plunged him into a system that cared no more\r\nfor his budget than a cyclone for a baby carriage.  Tariffs, bankrupt\r\nrailways, the banking system, exchanges, and the common cost of living\r\nwere all but obliterated in the campaign of war loans, not the least\r\nmarvellous feature of which was that selling Victory Bonds almost made\r\nthe Finance Minister a friend of the common people.  The \"vicious\r\ncircle\" of higher wages and higher cost of living was offset by Sir\r\nThomas White's virtuous circle of money raised in Canada, spent in\r\nCanada, for goods needed by Canada and the Allies at the front.  The\r\nformula was 5 1/2 per cent with no taxes, and the best security in the\r\nworld--if the war was won, which of course it would be if people bought\r\nVictory Bonds.\r\n\r\nIn this era of the patriotism of the pocket, common reason almost\r\ntottered from her throne.  Ordinary financial logic was forgotten.\r\nEconomic delirium took hold of the nation.  A broker in those days\r\ncould talk in language more mysterious than the polite attentions of a\r\njuggler who pulls an egg from your pocket.  Newspapers were full of\r\njargon that sometimes seemed more fantastic than the theories of the\r\nHoly Rollers.  The citizen who could not cash a Victory Bond to pay a\r\ndebt was considered behind the times, and the banker who told you that\r\nit was better to sell bonds than to borrow on them at the bank was\r\nregarded as an oracle, even though you could not begin to comprehend\r\nhis logic.\r\n\r\nBut the Finance Minister was as calm as Gibraltar.  He was the man\r\nbehind the curtain and the show.  He was seldom absent from the\r\nOrders-in-Council convention, commonly known as Parliament.  He was\r\nagain and again acting Premier.  He cared little for Imperial\r\nConferences.  His war was at home.  His firing line was all over\r\nCanada.  He was the most stay-at-home and sedulous of our ministers.\r\nHe worked while others slept or sailed the seas.  No Victory Loan\r\nadvertisement proof escaped the eagle eye of this ex-newspaperman\r\nbefore it went to press.  He scanned and corrected every syllable.\r\nEvery advertisement was a sermonette from the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\nAn independent writer visiting Ottawa in the fall of 1916, wrote\r\nconcerning the Finance Minister:\r\n\r\n\"One of the best evidences of Ottawa's frame of mind is the way it\r\ntalks about Sir Thomas White--and the way Sir Thomas talks about\r\nhimself.  Sir Thomas White has probably rendered more real brain\r\nservice to this country in his few years of office than any one man who\r\nhas held office as a Minister--I am not now speaking of Prime\r\nMinisters, whose functions are particular and peculiar--since\r\nConfederation.  To Ottawa, Sir Thomas is little short of a miracle.\r\nThe frame of mind on both sides of politics regarding Sir Thomas is not\r\nunlike that of the farmer who saw a two-humped camel for the first\r\ntime.  \"Hell,\" said Ottawa, \"they ain't no such animal!\"  Now it calls\r\nSir Thomas White 'great'--and even Sir Thomas admits it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVol. I., No. 1 of The Onlooker, had this to say on the other side of\r\nthe ledger:\r\n\r\n\"One would gather from the way some of his admirers talk that he, and\r\nhe alone, was responsible for the success of the various loans issued\r\nduring the war.  He had it easy.  The country was literally bursting\r\nwith money seeking investment.  One could almost have raised it with\r\nhis eyes shut.  The whole community was humming with activity like a\r\ntop asleep; and still the orders from abroad came pouring in.  Every\r\nfresh loan stimulated activity anew.  All that was required was to\r\nissue the prospectus, pass the solicitation of funds to interested\r\ncanvassers, newspapers, publications, loan companies, banks, brokers,\r\nand hurrah at the end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things do look easy to the man who is not doing them.  Common\r\nsense admits that the man who patriotically juggled the billions from\r\npocket to exchequer and back to pocket again would have had a much\r\nharder task to undertake what somebody called \"the Gethsemane\" of\r\npaying the nation's bills when the \"hurrah\" was over.  The method of\r\nfinancing Canada in the war may be vastly different from the method\r\nnecessary in peace.  But when money must be had quickly in vast\r\nquantities there is no time to debate on just how you are going to get\r\nit.  Sir Thomas White's raid upon the pockets of Canada was a financial\r\nspectacle not to be judged by standards of thrift, for the very good\r\nreason that the people were nauseated with thrift talk, were looking\r\nfor something easy, and White had the instinct to know that the easier\r\nand the more spectacular he could make a Victory Loan the better for\r\nthe war.  He rowed with the current and knew he was doing it.  In his\r\nown financial brain, which is not unthrifty, he knew that the \"hurrah\"\r\nwas not healthy in the long run and that it could not last forever.\r\nBut once it was started there was no other way but to keep it up.\r\n\r\nThanks to Sir Thomas, every citizen had an opportunity to get himself\r\nrubber-stamped on behalf of the nation; which on general principles was\r\na good thing, because a large number of people at that time indulged\r\nthe fiction that as the Government was paying its debts, a good way to\r\ndo it would be to print more paper money.  It was the Finance\r\nMinister's opportunity to instruct us, that the Government was not\r\npaying debts--but making it possible to pay wages.  Unless the surplus\r\nof every man's earnings was invested in Victory Bonds there would\r\nshortly be no big industries left to pay the earnings at all, Canada\r\nwould cease to export munitions--which might be the one thing to lose\r\nthe war, in which case nothing would be left for any of us but to pay\r\nwar indemnities to the enemy.  Critics declared that non-taxable bonds\r\nwere an iniquity in favour of the big investor who could heap up\r\nbonanza investments without taxes; another way of accusing the Finance\r\nMinister of being in league with the \"big interests.\"  But we must do\r\nSir Thomas the credit of taking a sure way to encourage the small\r\ninvestor by refusing to tax his patriotism.  A 100th per cent tax on\r\nsome people's patriotism might have squelched it altogether.  It would\r\nhave been a public service if Sir Thomas White had plainly told the\r\npeople, not less about why they should buy Victory Bonds during a\r\nperiod of inflation, but more about what would happen to them when\r\ndeflation began to set in; when, ceasing to buy Victory Bonds at a low\r\nprice, we should have to buy bread and butter and clothes at higher\r\nprices than ever at a time when money began to sneak away, we knew not\r\nwhither.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was too much to expect one man to organize the \"hurrah\" and\r\nafterwards to conduct the \"Gethsemane.\"  At any rate, before we had an\r\nopportunity to test the real size of Sir Thomas as a public servant he\r\nresigned office.\r\n\r\nWhether the Finance Minister at the climax of his big _opus_ was shrewd\r\nenough to imagine that the kudos of the loans might get him the\r\nPremiership, we do not profess to know.  He is not considered famous as\r\na political strategist.  He has far too much serenity.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Sir Thomas was chairman of a monster meeting in Toronto when\r\nten thousand people who tried to hear Theodore Roosevelt speak on\r\nbehalf of that year's Victory Loan of Canada were turned away.  For\r\nsome hours he had been in company with a man whose mastery of the\r\nunusual was almost the equal of Mark Twain's.  If ever he had a chance\r\nto be startled out of his headmaster poise, here it was.  But he made a\r\nlong, tedious preamble of a speech the only sentence of which that\r\nsticks in my memory is that sincerely girlish utterance of Portia to\r\nAntonio after the trial, \"Sir, you are very welcome to our house.\"  It\r\nwas like pinning a pink bow knot on the head of a lion.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas showed strategic ability when he refused the Premiership.\r\nAfter declining the Premiership he was not likely to need a portfolio.\r\n\r\nPublic life is considerably like war.  Every time you move there must\r\nbe a motive.\r\n\r\nA former political crony of Sir Thomas said to the writer that the\r\nexcess profits tax imposed by the Minister was one of the cleverest\r\npolitical manoeuvres ever perpetrated in Ottawa, because it drove\r\nmanufacturers and merchants to advertise in the newspapers in order to\r\nreduce their profits, thus paying part of the excess to the newspapers\r\nrather than to the Government; which was supposed to have made the\r\nGovernment popular with newspapers on both sides of the political\r\nfence.  This is a genially cynical way of saying that every publisher\r\nhas his price, and that the Finance Minister had made some startling\r\nprogress in his mentality since the day when he was charmed with\r\neverybody in Parliament.  But it is a Machiavellian touch quite\r\nuncharacteristic of a man whose friends had designated him for the\r\nPremiership.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Sir Thomas may have had good reason for considering him\r\nas the next Premier.  On the evidence of the mere handling of executive\r\nbig business demanding cool judgment, practical vision and powerful\r\naction he was the equal of any other candidate for the office.  His\r\ndefects were less obvious, but perhaps more vital in the case.  Sir\r\nThomas was not designed to lead, which in these days means to be\r\nconstantly recreating a party, not to operate a well-built governmental\r\nmachine.  In his nine years of public life he did a big national work\r\nand justly earned all the real distinction he ever got.  He did so much\r\nin a big, unusual way for the nation that his passing out becomes\r\nanother example of how easy it is to cripple administration by\r\nsacrificing public service brains to private business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLED TO THE POLITICAL PULPIT\r\n\r\nHON. NEWTON WESLEY ROWELL\r\n\r\nN. W. Rowell has the bearing of a man who long ago felt that he was\r\ncalled to do something for a cause or a country and has never got over\r\nit.  Meanwhile he has done much for both a cause and a country, and\r\nseems to have quit before the country had begun to enjoy more than the\r\nleast agreeable elements in his character.  To have suffered the\r\ninsistent righteousness of Mr. Rowell so long, and at the close of the\r\nfirst period of his life when he seemed to be getting his own measure\r\nas a public man on a big stage, to see him withdraw like a chambered\r\nnautilus into his shell, not only from the Cabinet but from his seat in\r\nDurham, is a little hard on public patience.  But of course the\r\nchambered nautilus may emerge again.\r\n\r\nYears ago Mr. Rowell had moral energy enough to reconstruct a large\r\npart of the world in Liberalism and in the Methodist Church.  Today he\r\nfinds evangelic Liberalism rampant out on the skyline under such men as\r\nCrerar and Drury, and the church discussing social reformation in\r\nphraseology associated with dynamic ideas to which he never could be\r\nassimilated.\r\n\r\nMr. Rowell's career reminds us that there are four brands of Liberals\r\nin Canada: Evolutionary; Manchester School; Laurierite; Agrarian.\r\nTories never evolve.  There are only good Tories and bad ones.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the first group, and there is nothing in his temperament\r\nto make him anything else.  Free Trade never did convince him; he broke\r\naway from the enchanting tyranny of Laurier; and, though born on a\r\nfarm, he never could revert to the plough-handles for a vision of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJudging from some fairly recent preachments by able reverends such as\r\nWm. Woodsworth and Salem Bland, there may be as many brands of\r\nMethodism.  If so we unhesitatingly place Mr. Rowell in the\r\nevolutionary group.  Therefore by personal development he is next thing\r\nto a Conservative; and the latest phase of his career proves that in\r\nworking it out he has practised the fine old platitude of Polonius to\r\nLaertes:\r\n\r\n  \"To thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Rowell is one of our most encouraging types of what is called the\r\nself-made man.  Any Oxford professor hearing him make a typically good\r\nspeech in London on \"The Commonwealth of Nations under the Union Jack,\"\r\nwould infer that he had taken a post-graduate course in political\r\nhistory after graduating as a B.A.  But Mr. Rowell never even attended\r\na High School.  He went from the farm as a lad to be a parcel boy in a\r\nLondon, Ont., dry-good store.  The class-meeting and the sermon and the\r\nMechanics' Institute gave him a taste for serious literature.  He came\r\nup in the oratorical county that produced G. W. Ross and J. A.\r\nMacdonald.  He must have regularly read Tannage's sermons.  He was a\r\nyouth when the Y.M.C.A. movement invaded Canada along with baseball.\r\nHe made the choice.  He passed into the Law School, somehow dodging all\r\nthe good brethren who advised him to go into the ministry.  And through\r\nthe opportunity afforded him by the successful practice of law and\r\nLiberalism on a large scale he has been able to preach his sermons to\r\nmuch bigger audiences than he ever could have found in the Methodist\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIf some of the advanced radicals of these days would con over the\r\noutlines of a career like this, they might get rid of some of their\r\nfantastic notions about State-devised equality and emancipation.  Mr.\r\nRowell instinctively reached out by industry and enthusiasm for the\r\nforces that would better his condition.  In so doing he spent a large\r\npart of himself upon the betterment of society.  The result is an\r\nintellectual, moral and financially successful character of which any\r\ncommunity might be proud--so long as the community contained but one of\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\nRowellism is a good salt.  It is not good porridge.  The average\r\nunprofessional Christian man cannot live on the levels where Mr. Rowell\r\nbreathes so easily.\r\n\r\nTime and again have we heard the equivocal remark about this man; if\r\nsuch, and however so.  Why not take the man as he is and make the best\r\nof him?  Surely by now he has proved that he has a definite and\r\nuplifting leverage on public life.  It is of no use to complain that he\r\nnever was cut out to be a leader in anything but ethical ideas of\r\nstatesmanship.  It was political makeshiftery to make such a man the\r\nleader of Ontario Liberalism, which did not ask to be led but to be\r\ncajoled and tricked up for the carnival.  It was fatuous to imagine\r\nthat he could ever become a chief of the National Liberal and\r\nConservative party to which he now inextricably belongs.  If secret\r\nambition ever spurred him to indulge that dream--which seems\r\nincredible--sober reflection at the looking glass should have corrected\r\nthe strabismus.  Mr. Rowell is not a leader of men, in action; never\r\nwas and never could be--without some drastic transformation in his\r\noutward character such as he has never shown.\r\n\r\nThe last time I observed Mr. Rowell he was in the lounge of a club\r\nwhere he had just finished lunch.  All about him were scores of men in\r\ngroups, each group animatedly intent upon some topic from baseball to\r\nhigh finance.  A few weeks earlier that same club had given a public\r\ndinner to Mr. Rowell and Sir George Foster, when each seemed to overdo\r\nthe other in gripping those present by the presentation of a world\r\ntheme backed by a striking personality.  In the lounge Mr. Rowell, our\r\nbest authority on the ethics of the Empire and the League of Nations,\r\nwent about alone, unobtrusive, drab-coloured, almost insignificant.  He\r\nspoke to nobody and few men as much as noticed him.  He nodded gravely\r\nnow and again, but never smiled.  Both hands in his trouser pockets, he\r\nseemed to be gazing at some vagabond blind spot in the room.  He almost\r\nseemed to be whistling to himself like a lad in a forest.  Presently he\r\nwandered out.\r\n\r\nBy no exercise of imagination could one conceive such a man as a\r\nCanadian political leader.  If there is anything in an aura he has it\r\nnot.  A halo would have suited him better.\r\n\r\nThree elements conspire to make Rowell:\r\n\r\nConscience; oratory; opportunity.\r\n\r\nMost men have trouble enough with any two of the three.  Mr. Rowell\r\ncontinues to hold our respect in spite of the whole trinity.  Too much\r\nconscience always on duty at a peak load is no way to attract a vast\r\nvariety of people who relish a degree of sinfulness now and again.  We\r\ndo not repudiate the value of conscience in public affairs.  The public\r\nman without it provides almost the only sane argument for the\r\npreservation of the gallows.  But when one man carries so much of it, a\r\nnumber of others may be excused for carrying less.  This is an age of\r\nspecialties.\r\n\r\nIt is required of a truly efficient conscience, however, that it be\r\ninstant in season and out of season, and that it do not wait upon\r\nopportunity.  When the Ross Government was so old in sin that even the\r\nnew _Globe_ editor accused the ship of having barnacles, we fail to\r\nremember that Mr. Rowell lifted his voice against it.  He was a\r\ncandidate for the Commons five years before James Whitney began his\r\nregime of government by indignation; at a time when if Ontario went on\r\na political spree Ottawa got a headache.  Big-party government was\r\npretty strong in those days to keep a man like Rowell from talking out\r\nin meeting.  The value of a conscience to a community, whatever it may\r\nbe to an individual or a party, is in giving it a chance to speak out\r\nwhen something is wrong with your own group, not when it is politically\r\nconvenient to take off the muffler.  Mr. Rowell's method of opening\r\nDurham as a safe seat for himself by making a Senator of the\r\nConservative member for Durham, was one way of reforming the Civil\r\nService, which was one of his Government hobbies.  But in practical\r\npolitics it is sometimes necessary to do evil that good may come.  Mr.\r\nRowell needed a safe seat--in order to do his work for the country.  It\r\nseems a pity that a constituency so shrewdly obtained could not have\r\nbeen steadfastly held.\r\n\r\nAs an orator Mr. Rowell is remarkable in spite of two defects; no\r\nclassical or humanities education except what he diligently dug out of\r\nbooks, and a very thin voice.  Few public speakers of our time use such\r\nadmirable diction, and it is a rare one who can make so lean a voice\r\nthrill so completely with passion in the presentation of powerfully\r\nsynthetic ideas.  This is a great gift; but like personal beauty it has\r\nits fatal fascination.  Mr. Rowell has not ceased to suffer from a sort\r\nof bondage to his oratory as he has from the tyranny of his conscience.\r\nIn conversation he seldom just talks.  He seems to deliver dicta.  He\r\nrarely glows with the fire of the moment; he seems to be preparing for\r\nthe grand occasion.  The stage must be set.  When did he ever make a\r\npoor speech that he had time to prepare?  Or a good one impromptu?  One\r\ncannot soon forget his remarkable speech in the Toronto Arena at the\r\ncitizens' reception to Premier Borden in 1915.  Here this lifelong\r\nLiberal made what up to that moment was the greatest speech of his\r\ncareer; and he was speaking as a British citizen, not as a Canadian\r\nLiberal.\r\n\r\nWith equal power, to a small group, but with even more passion as a\r\nbroad-minded Canadian, he spoke to the Bonne Entente in Toronto in 1917\r\non a subject which may have had something to do with his future as a\r\nDominion instead of a Provincial statesman.  In this connection I quote\r\nfrom a report of that meeting made by the writer:\r\n\r\n\"He took his preconsidered skeleton of argument with all its careful\r\nalignment of crescendos and climaxes and clothed it with the passion of\r\na rousing, emotionalizing speech.  The points somewhat roughly made by\r\nother men he remade by a new grouping of the ideas.  With eminent\r\njuridical clarity he worked himself up the ropes of oratory, and when\r\nhe got to the tiptop of the trapeze he flung out his big compliment to\r\nthe French-Canadians now at the front.  Of course he said other things.\r\nHe made fine use of the historic as he always manages to do.  But when\r\nhe got away from that into the great little story of Courcellette and\r\nthe gallant 22nd with its sole surviving eighty men and two officers\r\nbesides the C.O. \"fighting the Germans like devils,\" he had voltage\r\nenough for an audience of ten thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Canada ever had a public speaker who with so little\r\npersonal makeup for the part could so wonderfully deliver himself in\r\norational speeches on any topic of nations, commonwealths and empires.\r\nIf Rowell were less of an orator he would be more of a power as a\r\npublic man.  Carrying around loaded blank pistols is not nearly so\r\ncongenial to most men as a cigar in the left hand vest pocket.  There\r\nis in most of us a strain of buncombe which we exhibit often when\r\nothers are not looking.  I think Rowell exhibits most of his in solemn\r\nform in public.  If one has not what is called _savoir faire_ he must\r\nmake his abstractions and silences confoundedly interesting.  Rowell\r\npacks all his power into a speech.  Therefore even his greatest\r\nspeeches are sometimes to some people a bore.\r\n\r\nI think he must have risen to about his height of unceremonious\r\ninformality at a Peace dinner in London when he sat next to the\r\nplenipotentiary from Serbia, to whom he remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I should think so many dinners and public functions would be hard on\r\nyour constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" rejoined the Serbian with a gravely astute look at his\r\ncompanion; \"but we have an upper and a lower chamber.\"\r\n\r\nRowell told this on himself.  Even that he could not have done five\r\nyears ago.  Mingling with men more solemn than himself he observed the\r\ninconvenience of solemnity.  He really wants to be a conductor of the\r\nlittle currents of energy that make men think and act in small groups.\r\nSome good parson years ago should have encouraged him to smoke between\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nOpportunity.  This focuses the other two.  Rowell has seldom neglected\r\nthis mistress.  It is comparatively easy for many men to make\r\nthemselves at the Sign of the Dollar; as a rule more difficult at the\r\nSign of Culture.  Mr. Rowell is a man of fine intellectual attainments,\r\nwhich he has seldom failed to use in furthering his public success.\r\nYet he was a good while becoming incorporated into the body politic of\r\nLiberalism.  The world was his parish.  Wesley was his idol; then\r\nLaurier.  Between these two it is a marvel that even at the rather late\r\nage of forty-four he came to the leadership of Liberalism in Ontario.\r\nHere he became the prophet who would abolish the bar even before its\r\ntime, not without provocation.  There had been stories of wild drinking\r\nescapades among some of the Liberal leaders in Queen's Park.  Mr.\r\nRowell can therefore be amply forgiven for having been the instigator\r\nof that poster, \"Is That You, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\nThis can be remembered from his five years of misfit rule in Queen's\r\nPark when many of his good offices there are mainly forgotten.  It was\r\nrather pitiful to observe how incapable Mr. Rowell was of giving vent\r\nto his great talents in that Legislature.  He did not understand the\r\nlingo.  Most of it was too piffling and small.  He knew Ontario better\r\nfrom the angle of corporation law.  He made a poor showing as leader,\r\nfor there were no great issues in which he could lead; though he did\r\ninitiate a great deal of useful welfare legislation.  He made one\r\nheroic effort to understand New Ontario in the rough when he donned\r\noveralls and went down in some of the mines.  But it was all too much\r\nin the rough.  One imagines there must have been many a moment when he\r\nwished he had never taken that leadership with so precious little to\r\nlead, and yearned for some larger way.  But it was a long, long trail.\r\nAnd Laurier was now a strange old man.  Whichever way he looked he was\r\nin a blind alley.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition gave him a way out.  The old chief's attitude towards the\r\nwar made Laurier Liberalism still more unpalatable.  Rowell was deeply\r\nstirred by the war.  He could see in the upheaval of old and new world\r\nideas the sort of grand realignment which he could understand; the\r\nassertion of true Liberalism in true democracy.  Any average speech of\r\nhis during the war demonstrates that he was among those few leaders of\r\nthought whom the struggle lifted into a larger conception of manhood in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAgain, honesty to himself suggests that Mr. Rowell did not suffer such\r\npangs at his severance from Laurier as did men like Carvell, Guthrie\r\nand Clark, who had fought under the old man in Commons.  At the Liberal\r\nWin-the-War meeting in 1917, he threw off all disguises and fervently\r\nproclaimed that he had chosen to take office under \"the greatest\r\nPremier in the world.\"  The statement smacked not so much of\r\ninsincerity as of a sense of emancipation.  Mr. Rowell was no longer\r\nlabelled a Laurier Liberal.  He was a free agent in a new great\r\nconflict of force.  He was stirred as never he had been.  Of all the\r\nLiberals who took oath under the new administration he was the\r\nstrongest, and the most difficult to assign a competent task.  He was\r\nmade President of the Council and Minister of Information.  The\r\npeculiar advantage of the latter was that as real information was the\r\nlast thing that seemed to be wanted by anything resembling a\r\nGovernment, there was very little for Mr. Rowell to do at his desk and\r\nvery much time for him to be absent where he felt much more at home, in\r\nEurope.  As President of the Council he had great ability.\r\n\r\nThis one year of Ministry before the end of the war gave Mr. Rowell an\r\nopportunity to survey forces of whose operation he had no knowledge\r\nwhile he remained a mere Liberal.  He became officially familiar to\r\nLondon and as the constant companion of the Premier came very near to\r\nthe elbows of the great, when he did not suffer by comparison.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Peace Conference that gave him his real work.  During\r\nthe war any nation got the prestige that it could win, either by its\r\nown efforts or in league with others.  All nations on each side were\r\nmore or less animated by the one great purpose.  Suddenly the golden\r\ngrip of union was off.  The second war began around the Peace table.\r\nIn this new and more precarious conflict of pour-parlers and old secret\r\ndiplomacies under the dangerous flare of the self-determination torch,\r\nnational selfishness rushed to the front of the stage.  Every pocket of\r\npeople in Europe hemmed between a river, a mountain and a dialect\r\nclaimed the rights of a nation, when more than half of them should have\r\nbeen conveniently merged into workable groups having some form of\r\ngovernment with which nations of experience could deal.\r\n\r\nIn this clamour of the _voces populi_ the voice of Canada was not to be\r\ndisregarded.  We had reason that it should be heard.  We were in sudden\r\ndanger of being overshadowed at the Conference by the vast figure of\r\nthe other half of North America.  Mr. Rowell has never been an\r\nanti-Yankee.  He has too much fine sense ever to pull feathers out of\r\nthe eagle in retaliation for twisting the lion's tail.  He knows as\r\nwell as any man the strategic and moral necessity of Canada being the\r\nreal House of Interpreter to the two leading Anglo-nations.  He knew it\r\nat the Conference.  But he knew also that in proportion to service and\r\nsacrifice in the war, Canada in the Council of Peace had a right to be\r\nheard and considered as the voice of a nation occupying the northern\r\nhalf of North America.\r\n\r\nThere was great sense in the estimate of a leading London correspondent\r\nthat among the four most impressive and masterful personalities at the\r\nGeneva Assembly of the League, Rowell the Canadian was at least the\r\nfourth.  This was not merely a personal or natural compliment.  It was\r\nthe sincere recognition of a fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Rowell had the gift and the energy of will to translate the Peace\r\ninto Canadian language.  He gave Canada a voice in Europe.  He did try\r\nso far as one man might to play up to the voice given to Canada by the\r\ndead in Flanders.  In the big occasion when great tumult of forces were\r\nrushing to a climax Rowell rose to the opportunity--as he always has\r\ndone--and he earned the lasting gratitude of his country.  We needed\r\njust that intellectual power and that moral audacity, not only in\r\nEurope but in Washington.\r\n\r\nYes, N. W. Rowell has made a big use of opportunity.  He has even\r\ncreated it.  But it was seldom the little simple thing at his door that\r\nroused his great qualities.  It was the bigger issue that lay out among\r\nthe mountain tops.  He was overwhelmingly eloquent for the universal\r\neight-hour day when he attended the International Labour Conference in\r\nWashington.  The League of Nations had recommended it.  But what of the\r\ncheap-labour competition in the Orient?  And what did Mr. Rowell know\r\nabout Industry and Democracy at all?\r\n\r\nMr. Rowell made a bold bid for recognition as a statesman of\r\ninternational repute.  And he got it.  His speeches on the Empire were\r\nconsistently a greater voice than Borden ever could have had.  The\r\ncolleague of the Premier became his Imperial master because he had the\r\npower which Borden lacked, of making the British world-Commonwealth\r\nlive in great public utterances.\r\n\r\nWhat a journey had this man travelled now from \"Is That You Daddy?\" in\r\nQueen's Park!\r\n\r\nAnd it may be sensibly asked--What was his great intention?  Canada is\r\ninterested to know what is \"the big idea\" in this man's mind.\r\nCorporation law cannot contain him now.  He has tried his strength and\r\nknows it.  He knows that other men know it.\r\n\r\nOnce during the derelict days of the Coalition it was rumoured that\r\nRowell on a Western trip would sketch out a new leadership--for\r\nhimself.  But he was not a man to throw Borden overboard.  He had a\r\nprofound respect for the Premier, who had made great use of him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if only Rowell had been born Conservative instead of a\r\nWin-the-War Liberal converted into a Coalitionist, the Premier might\r\nhave called him to succeed.  We know not.  There was a predicament.\r\nWhite, Meighen, Rowell--all must be considered.  There was the\r\nWashington post, if ever it should come to be.  Did Mr. Rowell ever\r\nintimate that he wanted either of these?  Nobody has said.  But Sir\r\nRobert was wise at least not to have offered him the Premiership.  Too\r\nlong had that been the office of a man who could not lead.  It was time\r\nfor a leader.  It is not surprising that Mr. Rowell should have stepped\r\nout of the Administration when Meighen went to the head of it.  He\r\ncould not comfortably serve under Meighen.  Ambition is a tyrant.\r\nSelf-sacrifice is usually easiest when great moral issues are\r\nuppermost.  For more than one session he would not even retain his seat\r\nin the House.  His retirement opens Durham, a safe constituency under\r\nRowell, and may weaken the Government.\r\n\r\nBut what if it does?  Mr. Rowell took office as a Coalitionist to win\r\nthe war.  The war is won.  But his work--is only nicely beginning.  How\r\nis he going to finish his work for this nation?  He has not said.  Not\r\nby making sundry speeches about the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nIf this country is to go ahead on its own native steam, it must be wise\r\nenough to find a big public place for the great talents of N. W.\r\nRowell.  And if Mr. Rowell, or any other disciple of opportunity in\r\npublic affairs, wants to give Canada what she has a right to expect\r\nfrom him, he will do well to make his needed money now at corporation\r\nlaw, and when he comes back to public life have a constant eye single\r\nto the glory of his country.\r\n\r\nTo evolve men of that stamp is not easy.  Rowell, like Meighen, is a\r\nproduct of the older studious days when youths buried themselves in\r\nbooks for the sake of getting on in the world without reference to mere\r\nmoney.  He is now at an age when the best he has made of himself might\r\nbe of incalculable good to the country if he could help the Government\r\nto go back to power and go with the National Liberal-Conservative Party\r\nas conscientiously as he entered the Unionist Government.\r\n\r\nConscience; Oratory; Opportunity.  The greatest of these is Conscience;\r\nthe least, Opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUTOCRAT FOR DIVIDENDS\r\n\r\nBARON SHAUGHNESSY\r\n\r\nCanada has a national habit of veneration for the C.P.R. just as England\r\nused to have for Kitchener in Egypt.  The travels of H. M. Stanley in\r\nAfrica were not more wonderful than the everyday lives of Sandford\r\nFleming's engineers routeing that great new line through the Rockies; and\r\nthe legend of Monte Cristo scarcely more fabulous than the exploits of\r\nVan Horne in getting the money or the work done without it.  The man who\r\nbought supplies for Van Horne (when there was money) and wrote letters or\r\nsent telegrams when there was none, got a finer preparation for being a\r\ngreat railwayman than most Premiers ever got for the duties of public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe sensations of the cured scriptural blind man who saw \"men as trees\r\nwalking\" were repeated to Canadians of thirty-five years ago who read\r\nabout those legendary Scots, Yankees and Canadians who flung that _chemin\r\nde fer_ over Canada to start a Confederacy into a nation.  And there was\r\nno _Boys' Own Annual_ in Canada to tell the tale, as it should have been\r\ndone, along with the tales of the Northwest Mounted Police and the\r\nadventures of the Hudson's Bay Company.  George Stephen, Donald A. Smith,\r\nRobert Angus, Sandford Fleming, John A. Macdonald, Van Horne, the young\r\nShaughnessy--all seemed then to be not merely doers of the undoable, but\r\nmen of mighty imagination and a sort of Old Testament morality.  Even the\r\nPacific Scandal seemed as necessary a part of the narrative as the story\r\nof Joseph's coat and of Jacob and Esau were of the epic of Israel.\r\n\r\nWell, admittedly, most of that has faded from the Canadian Pacific.  We\r\nread the annual address of the C.P.R. President with yawns.  It all seems\r\nconsiderably like what is said and done at any directors' meeting of a\r\nrubber factory or a street railway.  You read the names of the directors\r\nand few of them strike you with any sense of novelty or of awe.  The room\r\nin which these magnates meet is--just a room; it used to be thought of as\r\na sort of Doges' Palace of finance.  You may even note that one of the\r\ndirectors is baggy at the knees, and any two of them may be talking along\r\nthe corridor about that very ordinary thing--the cost of living.\r\n\r\nOf all the men at any C.P.R. directors' meeting, Lord Shaughnessy knows\r\nmost about the steep side of finance.  He was the spender when there was\r\nnothing to spend.  The romantic adversities of those days never left him.\r\nHe came down to the presidency with the fear of no-funds in his soul.\r\nFrom the beginning until then he had felt all the ragged edges of C.P.R.\r\nlife.  He had grimly chuckled to Van Horne, the occasionally helpless\r\nwizard, over the hard times.  And hard times never really left the road\r\nuntil Van Horne handed the C.P. over to Shaughnessy just at the edge of\r\nthe era when the system was getting ready to handle phenomenal traffic\r\narising out of stupendous immigration.\r\n\r\nFrom then on till the day that he also went out was the epoch when\r\ntraffic and travel became vaster than the road, and greater than the men.\r\nIt was his to operate, and to build as well.  But the operations were all\r\nof a system which had creaked into through traffic from Yokohama to\r\nMontreal as far aback as 1889; and the new lines built under Shaughnessy\r\nwere just branches of the old trunk.  Shaughnessy took over bulging\r\nreceipts after he had spent years at painful expenditures.  He took over\r\na despotism and made it an autocracy.\r\n\r\nIt was not in his practical, unromantic temperament to play the\r\nGargantuan role.  He had not the mentality.  Van Horne left the road when\r\nthe road threatened to become bigger than its creator.  Shaughnessy began\r\nto work on it when he knew that the bigger he made the system the greater\r\nwould be his own executive authority, and the bigger the dividends to the\r\nholders of stock.\r\n\r\nThere was a radical contrast between these two men; and as much between\r\nthe road built by Van Horne and the system operated and magnified by\r\nShaughnessy.  The former would not have his shadow dwarfed by the\r\ndimensions of his own creation.  The latter had created nothing: he would\r\nhave the shadow of the thing fling itself so vastly over the nation--and\r\nthe nations--that whenever men spoke of C.P. they thought of Shaughnessy,\r\nand when they said his name they mentally took off their hats to the\r\nheadship of the greatest system of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not have been Shaughnessy's intention.  It was certainly\r\nthe effect.  We have all gone through the era of profound respect for the\r\ncold autocrat of the twentieth century, as some of us did that of awesome\r\nveneration of the railway giants of the nineteenth.  We have read\r\nnewspaper stories--some of them buncombe--about this man's all-seeing eye\r\nas he travelled over the system, as we did of the peripatetic omniscience\r\nof James J. Hill and the Gargantuan humours of Van Horne.  We have\r\nconsented that the system perfected by Shaughnessy was the most\r\nmarvellous known of its kind, and therefore the man at its head must be a\r\nphenomenal administrator.\r\n\r\nVery likely we have been warped by our enthusiasm.  Shaughnessy was no\r\nmiracle man.  He was a wonderful _maestro_ of details, a clear-headed\r\norganizer of systems and a man to provoke high respect in those who had\r\nto deal with him at close range.  But he had perhaps less sheer ability\r\nfor detail than Van Horne, who as a rule despised the botheration of it.\r\nI have heard Van Horne dictating to his secretary a mass of intimate\r\ninstructions to a contractor about how to build a rotunda in a hotel in\r\nCuba, at the same time with his left hand on a drawer full of complicated\r\nnotes on his philosophy of life, which with the other lobe of his brain\r\nhe was traversing in order to engulf the interviewer as soon as the\r\nletter was finished.  Shaughnessy never could have carried on such an\r\ninterview, lasting four hours of a busy life.  His talks to the press\r\nmust be curt and comprehensive--or else elliptical.  He had no exuding\r\nvivacity.  When I talked to him--or listened to him--he was cold and\r\nexact.  He left his chair only to walk erectly to the window.  He\r\ndeviated not a syllable from the subject in hand--the system.  He\r\nworshipped that: as much as any Mikado ever did his ancestry.  He paid\r\npassing veneration to Van Horne--when from the slant of his remark I\r\nsurmised that he was critical even in his admiration for that epical\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nShaughnessy is essentially a system-man.  When he travelled he had his\r\npractical jokes and his Irish stories and his fondness for the social\r\nside; but he was conventionally as correct as a time-table.  Had there\r\nbeen a spark of genius in him he would have extinguished it for the sake\r\nof betterments to the most conventional Colossus in Canada.  The C.P.R.\r\nwas supposed to lead.  It was built for dividends, and born in politics.\r\nIt had craft at its cradle.  The new policy under Shaughnessy was bigger.\r\nIt had to do less with Asia, with spectacle, with carved gods; more with\r\nEurope, with immigration posters, with land settlement.  Shaughnessy had\r\ntaken over a system which could be used ostensibly as the agent of the\r\nImmigration Department and of the Interior; effectively as the base of\r\npopulation-supply on its own account.\r\n\r\nAs Shaughnessy worked it out the C.P. had a scheme of national expansion\r\nthat acted independent of government; its own ships, trains, roads,\r\ndocks, land offices, immigration agents, poster-advertising--until the\r\naverage European looking for a way out of economic slavery believed that\r\nthe C.P.R. was the owner and operator of Canada.  A belief which was not\r\ncontradicted, except officially, at home.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mackenzie set the pace for building; Shaughnessy for operation.\r\nBut Shaughnessy built fast.  He did it under a handicap of two systems\r\nagainst one.  The difference was that an average new line under\r\nShaughnessy paid dividends, or at least did not appreciably lower\r\ndividends already declared.\r\n\r\nUnder Lord Shaughnessy it was unofficially believed that the head of the\r\nC.P.R. was somehow overlord to governments.  Shaughnessy the impenetrable\r\nwas not the agent of a democracy, but an emperor.  He had his counterpart\r\nin Japan.  The Orientalism which Van Horne infused into the system even\r\nwhile he laughed it out of court, was solemnly accepted by the man who\r\ncame after.  But it was the Orientalism of efficiency.  Shaughnessy was\r\nits symbol.  Away from it he was of little consequence except as a\r\nbenevolent citizen with statesmanlike views upon how governments should\r\ngovern.  Within it he was mighty.  He felt himself the apex of a thing\r\nthat knew no provincial boundaries.  He consciously made it the\r\ninstrument of Empire.  He was inordinately proud of its morale.  To him\r\nit was a complicated army.  He felt it assimilating men who lived, moved\r\nand had their being in C.P.R.--as he had.  He was the great human rubber\r\nstamp.  He had extra power.  He lived on fiats and papal bulls.  Men\r\nlearned to tremble at his nod--not at Shaughnessy, but at the man who\r\npersonalized the infallible system.  And as governments came up and\r\ncapsized in the storms of public sentiment, the great system went on in\r\nits sullen but splendid way, a sort of solar system in which parties and\r\ngovernments gravitated.\r\n\r\nIt would have needed a greater soul than Shaughnessy to be cynical about\r\nC.P.R.  It often needed his latent Irish humour to appreciate the larger\r\ncynicism which it expressed concerning the country.  The pap-fed infants\r\nof Mackenzie and Hays served but to illustrate by contrast the perfection\r\nand the well-oiled technique of the dynamo operated by Shaughnessy.  It\r\nbecame an obsession with him, as it did with Flavelle over a commercial\r\ncompany, that \"the king can do no wrong.\"  His annual report bristled\r\nwith pride over the Company's achievements.  He insisted upon the\r\ninherent morality of the thing and of the men who were its officials.\r\nAnd the older he grew the more Shaughnessy became absorbed in it.  In his\r\ncareer the office of President reached its climax.  It was shorn of much\r\nof its aspect of awe as soon as he left it.\r\n\r\nHis knighthood was a slight decoration on so august a personage; as\r\nthough the king had decorated the Mikado.  The baronage more nearly\r\nfitted the case.  Shaughnessy was not too passionately a Home Ruler to\r\ntake it.  But he was never so good a president of the C.P.R. after he got\r\nit.  He became particular over forms and etiquette.  One almost looked\r\nfor a change of guard at the gate when entering the President's office.\r\n\r\nNo pomp, however, could undo such efficiency, and in the main such\r\nnational sanity.  Shaughnessy always liked to have a voice in national\r\naffairs.  That was partly tradition.  It also kept the public from\r\nremembering that the railway after all was a creature of government and\r\nof politics.  It sometimes deflected public attention from the \"melon\"\r\npatch which was the _Toronto World's_ sobriquet for the C.P.R. \"pork\r\nbarrel,\" and from the ever potential lobby maintained by the company at\r\nOttawa.  Of course lobbies are always repudiated.  No self-respecting\r\nrailway ever knows it by that name.  There is no department of lobbyage\r\nin the head offices.  The art is never taught.  But it is childish to\r\ndodge the public necessity of a great corporation being represented at\r\nthe centre of national legislation.  In fact, C.P. has loomed so large in\r\npublic affairs that a member of Parliament for the Company would\r\nsometimes have been scarcely ridiculous.  Whenever Lord Shaughnessy went\r\nto Ottawa, it was public news.  He never went for his health, seldom\r\nwithout some issue too big for a subordinate to handle.  Had the Minister\r\nof Railways gone to Montreal to see Mr. President, it would have seemed\r\nquite as natural.\r\n\r\nThe war gave Lord Shaughnessy for a time almost equal prominence with Sir\r\nSam Hughes.  His quite sensible speech criticizing the haphazard and\r\ncostly methods of recruiting made Hughes retort that to raise the First\r\nContingent was as great a task as building the C.P.R.  Lord Shaughnessy\r\nearned that absurd retort because of his announcement to the Government\r\nthat he meant to make the speech; as though the nation would be waiting\r\nto hear it.  There was room for one super-governmentarian at Ottawa;\r\nnever for two.  It was Hughes _vs._  Shaughnessy.\r\n\r\nLord Shaughnessy's retirement from the presidency was not sudden.  He had\r\nreached his zenith.  His eyesight was bad.  But he had not lost his grip.\r\nThe war threw such an unusual load on the system and so changed its\r\ncomplexion that it became necessary to have a younger man.  There is\r\nreason to believe that the war rudely upset much of the Imperial dignity\r\nof the great system.  The C.P. was no longer a law unto itself.  It was\r\npart of the national pool.  The President was no longer a sublime\r\nautocrat; he was a public agent.  The life blood of a globe-girdling\r\nsystem was drained by the war, even while it retained its supremacy as\r\nthe greatest railway and more than held up its end compared with the\r\nrailway muddle in the United States.  Never again could the C.P. recover\r\nits splendid isolation of greatness.  Public ownership was being thrust\r\nupon the nation by the bankruptcy of the other roads.  Shaughnessy had no\r\nreal fear that it would ever absorb the C.P.R.  But he had reason to\r\nsuspect that a huge Government system would be more or less of a menace\r\nto the system which he had spent his life to build up.  There was no\r\nbetter way than to retire, leaving the chief administration to a man of\r\nhis own choice and retaining the post of Chairman along with the room\r\noccupied by the old President.  Even here the old autocrat survives.  The\r\nproposal made by Baron Shaughnessy to pool all the railways, except the\r\nGrand Trunk, and to put them all under C.P. administration with a\r\nguarantee of dividends to C.P. shareholders--was a magnificent play to\r\nthe gallery.  The other roads were undeniably bankrupt, when even the\r\nsplendid showing made by the management could not make their records\r\npalatable to the public.  It was a strategic time to advertise once,\r\nfinally and for all, the unequalled efficiency of the old\r\nTranscontinental.\r\n\r\nBut Canadian railwaydom is dominated by C.P.R. as naturally as tides by\r\nthe moon.  The Railway Association, once the Railway War Board, are now a\r\njunta of dividendists and of paid chiefs of the Government system, to\r\noppose--whenever necessary--the adverse judgments of the Government's\r\nRailway Commission.  The road which was the tangible nexus of\r\nConfederation was built by two Americans, one of whom became a\r\nhigh-tariff Tory and a knight, the other an Imperialistic baron who\r\nbelieved in Dominion Home Rule for Ireland when the average Canadian\r\nconsidered Home Rule as treasonable as annexation.  It is the prerogative\r\nof any robust Canadian to oppose either infection from Broadway or\r\ndomination from Downing Street.  But, regarding the strategic position of\r\nCanada in the misnamed \"British Empire,\" we might all take a cue from\r\nLord Shaughnessy, who has had all the internationalizing emotions of\r\nwhich any man is normally capable, and can challenge any man to shew\r\nwhere he has ever compromised conscience or country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC SERVICE HOBBYIST\r\n\r\nSIR HERBERT AMES\r\n\r\nWhatever may be done by the Washington Conference to the League of\r\nNations, there still live two men to whom it is and shall be the hub of\r\nthe world.  Lord Robert Cecil and Sir Herbert Ames at least will never\r\nadmit that the League was a mere Wilson-Democrat device for making the\r\nworld safe for humanity, and that the alternative is a Harding-Republican\r\nexpedient for making Washington the new hub of the world.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert is much too cordial a cosmopolitan to begrudge Washington any\r\neminence she can get from imitating the League.  He is too charitable\r\neven to admit that if Dr. Wilson had stood for peace first and covenant\r\nsecond, no Washington Conference would have been needed.  He is also\r\nCanadian enough to realize that transferring the centre of the Peace\r\npropaganda to the leading Capital of the New World is a good way to\r\nremind the Old World that Ottawa has more to do with Washington than even\r\nLondon has.  Out of the Washington Conference may arise the Canadian\r\nenvoy.  Whatever happens in the Pacific zone of the world-open diplomacy\r\ncan never hurt Ottawa---nor disturb the complacent optimism of Sir\r\nHerbert Ames, Financial Director of the Secretariat to the League of\r\nNations.  The time may come when even Ottawa is considered a better place\r\nthan London or Geneva for the conduct of world-peace agenda.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Herbert Ames was chosen Financial Director of the League\r\nSecretariat he was chosen less to please Canada than to vindicate his own\r\nability.  When he spoke in Canada on how the League works he showed his\r\nremarkable optimism by extolling its operations at a time when Europe was\r\nmore anarchic than at any time since the war.\r\n\r\nEvery forward nation should have its Ames.  This one justified his\r\nexistence in Canada long before he became a knight or even an M.P. for\r\nSt. Antoine, Montreal.  At one time in his citizenship he was the\r\nincarnation of what a large number of people would be anxious to avoid;\r\nin the days when he used to pack his grip from Montreal and go forth on\r\nlectural pilgrimages over Ontario and other parts.  On a platform he\r\nalways seemed like a long, lean schoolmaster.  Sometimes he used a\r\nblackboard.  One of his pet subjects was prohibition.  He looked entirely\r\nlike it.  One could scarcely recollect having heard quite so dry a man on\r\nany subject.  He looked like the genius of self-denial--like a man who\r\nlong ago should have gone into a monastery, doing penance for the uplift\r\nof the world as mirrored in his own conscience, instead of remaining at\r\nlarge a common Presbyterian and a very uncommon sort of Tory.\r\n\r\nI was agreeably startled to find Sir Herbert in 1920 one of the most\r\ncordial and amiable men on the roster of Who's Who.  He was no longer\r\ndry, bigoted, or pedagogical.  In fact he was almost benignly human, even\r\nhumourous.  And I concluded that if intimacy with the League of Nations\r\ncould work such a change in the average man connected with it, there is\r\nsurely some function for the League as a cheerful solvent for the world.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Ames' previous work as Hon. Chairman of the National\r\nPatriotic Fund of course did a good deal to reclaim him.  Of all war work\r\nthis was among the most destructive of personal bigotry and political\r\nprejudice.  If Sir Herbert imbibed the real philosophy of the Patriotic\r\nFund he must be, speaking humanly, one of the wisest men in Canada.  It\r\nwas a scientific fact that at a time when men in the army were displaying\r\nincredible heroism, certain people at home were exhibiting unbelievable\r\nmeanness.  The people who used to attempt graft on the Patriotic Fund\r\nwere the kindergarten of the college of national profiteers who came\r\nlater.  They were happily out-numbered by the people who were thankful\r\nfor all they got and who in the greatest losses that life can inflict\r\nshowed almost sublime fortitude and patience.\r\n\r\nPreparation for some form of public service by doing it as he went along\r\nhas always been Ames' strongest characteristic.  He had eyes for the\r\nhomely, sometimes mean, job under his nose.  There was an evangelism\r\nabout him.  Why?  Because he was a citizen.  Where did he live?  In\r\nMontreal.  No man can be a reforming citizen in Montreal unless he has\r\nplenty of time, and some money.  Mr. Ames has always had both.  He also\r\nhas endless patience.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable proof that he intended to be a practical\r\nphilanthropist is the fact that for eight years he was one of the feeble\r\nAnglo-Saxon minority in the Montreal City Council.  An artist in search\r\nof contrast could never have found a finer example than a comparative\r\nstudy of the leader of the English section Ames, and the French boss, the\r\nlate L. A. Lapointe.  In the bilingual Legislature of an incorrigible\r\ncity Mr. Ames spoke two languages.  If he had mastered twenty he never\r\ncould have equalled Lapointe, who in my recollection of a long\r\nconversation some years ago could genially and grandly boast that the fad\r\nfor reforming the City of Montreal would never make much headway so long\r\nas he remained boss of the French section in Council.  Lapointe was\r\nMontreal's Tammany.  He held Montreal under his patronage and executive\r\nthumb before Mederic Martin had begun to achieve any fame beyond that of\r\na maker of cigars.  He knew every cranny of Montreal as intimately as the\r\nlate John Ross Robertson used to know Toronto.  Mr. Ames' knowledge of\r\nthe big town was fairly complete.  But if Mr. Ames and Mr. Lighthall, the\r\ngenie of civic information in Montreal, could have been one two-headed\r\nman, they never could have matched Lapointe in the expert business of\r\nknowing where to plant a man to give him a civic job or how to create a\r\njob to suit a man in need of it.\r\n\r\nYet for eight consecutive years Mr. Ames with no other desire than to do\r\nhis duty, to study Montreal, and perhaps qualify for larger service\r\nlater, remained a member of the City Council.  And he did his work there\r\nbefore the English-speaking element undertook to clean up the city--the\r\nmost genial, sarcastic failure of modern times.  He wrote little books\r\nabout Montreal.  He mastered French by studying it first-hand in France.\r\nThose who used to listen to his evangelical speeches in his own tongue\r\nsometimes wished he had learned a few nuances and inflexions in English.\r\nHe was for some time Chairman of the Municipal Board of Health, in a city\r\nwhere infant mortality is such a constant epidemic that babies' coffins\r\nare displayed in shop windows.  In 1907 he wrote a tractate on the\r\nhousing of the working classes, just on the eve of the period when\r\nMontreal began to be the worst city in America for high rents,\r\nextortionate charges for moving and intolerable congestion.  The\r\npublication of his views on the subject, however, showed that he had the\r\ncourage to point out what was wrong, even though he had no concrete\r\nconstructive proposal which any municipal government in Montreal or any\r\nLegislature in Quebec would ever accept as a working basis for putting\r\nthe thing right.  As far back as 1901 he indited a treatise on The City\r\nProblem, What Is It?  Twenty years later, after all Mr. Ames' burnings on\r\nthe subject, Montreal has slumped back into sheer mediaevalism in civic\r\ngovernment under the wheedling despotism of Mederic Martin, who presided\r\nat the public funeral of the only effort the city ever made to establish\r\na real business administration.  In that Quixotic eruption of public\r\nvirtue in 1912, Mr. Ames, after all his publicity on the subject of\r\nredeeming Montreal, was not even considered as a candidate for the Board\r\nof Control.\r\n\r\nOn the whole scarcely a public man, or even a reforming editor, in Canada\r\nhas talked so consistently and so cheerfully for so long a period and to\r\nso little apparent purpose, on the need for cleaning up civic government.\r\nThe difference between Mr. Ames and the average public-service expert in\r\nMontreal on this question is that Mr. Ames has never been worldly-wise\r\nenough to become an avowed cynic on the question.  He probably knows as\r\nwell as anybody that to clean up Montreal is in the same category as\r\nmaking Europe safe for the League of Nations; a much harder city to\r\nregenerate than even Philadelphia.  Muck-raking has no effect, when\r\ntwo-thirds of the population read French papers which never use the rake,\r\nand when the boss of three-fourths of the rest is himself often a target\r\nfor the yellows.  Mr. Ames should long ago in this connection have\r\npropounded a thesis, Hugh Graham, What Is It?  He would then be free to\r\ndissect the ethics of Mederic Martin and the late L. A. Lapointe.\r\n\r\nMartin rules Montreal in spite of Lord Atholstan, the Archbishop and the\r\nInternational Union, because in his own person he interprets the\r\ndistinction between Anglo and Franco.  In Montreal a dominant minority\r\ncontrols three-fourths of the commercial wealth.  A couple of dozen men\r\ncontrol big industries, railways, electric and water powers, finance and\r\nnewspapers.  When these men want the City Hall they consult the\r\ndirectory.  To them Montreal is a convenient sea-wharfing spot to conduct\r\nbig business; otherwise a French Canadian city and so, hopeless.  The\r\nchief common bond between this group and the city at large is the labour\r\nmarket.  The elections are a mere superficial disturbance.  The old\r\ncourteous alternative of a French mayor, an English mayor, and an Irish\r\nmayor has been discarded.  The mayors are all French now.  The population\r\nis overwhelmingly French.  The City Hall is as French as the courts.  The\r\ncivic jobs are given to Frenchmen.  As a rule there are plenty of jobs.\r\nIt is a fair compromise--that if the Anglos will monopolize most of the\r\nbig productive business, the civic administration must go to the Francos\r\nwho are the elective majority.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Ames, who was born in Montreal and is the only man who has\r\never undertaken to theorize openly as to its redemption, knows exactly\r\nwhy the place is so absorbing to the cynical mind.  He understands that a\r\nman cannot have the same geometrical and diligent enthusiasm for Montreal\r\nas he has for Toronto.  To be a thoughtful citizen of Montreal stimulates\r\nthe imagination and disgusts the economic sense.  For the past ten years\r\nSir Herbert has been too much absorbed in Ottawa and the League of\r\nNations to care much about the city where he spent so much of his earlier\r\nzeal for reclamation.  The member for St. Antoine has a larger orbit--to\r\nnegotiate which he has resigned his seat in the House.\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to consider whether there are not enough secretarial minds\r\nin Europe from which to take a man as Financial Secretary for the League\r\nof Nations, and let Sir Herbert come back to Canada to finish his work.\r\nHe has had world experiences enough to come back and be of some real use\r\nto the country.  He is not yet sixty.  He has ahead of him twenty years\r\nin which he could do a great deal more for the Empire about which he is\r\nso earnest by working in Canada than by occupying a conspicuous post\r\nsomewhere in Europe.  It is not the fashion for ex-Canadians who have had\r\npolitical or other experiences abroad to come back here for anything but\r\nspeeches and banquets.  Sir Herbert may be permitted to change the\r\nfashion.  With his versatility in French, his knowledge of Europe, his\r\nacquaintance with large public questions of finance and his general\r\n_savoir faire_, he seems to be just the kind of man who could head a\r\nmovement to nationalize Montreal.\r\n\r\nBut of course he never will do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHADOW AND THE MAN\r\n\r\nHON. SIR SAM HUGHES, K.C.B.\r\n\r\nThe career of the late Sam Hughes is a tragic reminder that no man in\r\npublic life can afford to regard himself as bigger than his suitable\r\njob.  When a nation has to retire a genius for the sake of enthroning\r\nwhat remains of common democracy the nation's loss is nobody's gain.\r\nIn the jungle book of our aristocracy Sam Hughes should have been Lord\r\nValcartier.  Not that a democratic country cares at all to be given any\r\nmore lords, even if Parliament had not asked the King to abolish the\r\ncustom.  But while peerages and baronetcies were being handed about for\r\nhonour, Hughes was the kind of man that should have got his--except\r\nthat he made it impossible.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is more interesting to record the shortcomings of Hughes\r\nthan to report the success of mediocrities.  Canada had in Hughes a\r\nname with which for a year or so to poster almost any part of the\r\nEmpire, especially England.  We are in danger of forgetting at this\r\ndistance--five years now since he resigned office--just what were the\r\nconditions that made him such a tremendous figure.\r\n\r\nSam Hughes, M.P., born in County Durham, Orangeman from the town of\r\nLindsay, editor, soldier, adventurer, school teacher who once taught\r\nEnglish and who never could make a speech, though he talked in\r\npublic--what was there about him up till 1914 to make any nation\r\nwonder?  The first time I saw Hughes, in 1910, a man whose office he\r\nhad just left said, as though imparting a State secret:\r\n\r\n\"There goes the next Minister of Militia.\"\r\n\r\nUp till that moment if anybody had asked me, \"Do you know Hughes?\" I\r\nshould have said, \"Oh, yes, everybody knows Jim Hughes, the School\r\nInspector.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of Canada's Army is immortal.  It is yet to be truly told.\r\nWhen it is told by the right man--whether historian or poet--the name\r\nHughes, as we know it at its best and biggest, will shine out like a\r\ngreat fixed star that tried to play being a comet.  On April 22nd, from\r\nthe sick bed that even he probably knew he never would leave of his own\r\nwill, in memory of St. Julien, he sent the army boys a brief message,\r\nthat he still believed in them as he always had.\r\n\r\nSimple little message, it meant much.  It would have meant a million\r\ntimes more if the \"boys\" could have flashed back a helio to the wan old\r\nGeneral who used to be such a noise in the world--\"Same to you,\r\nGeneral.\"  The boys somehow liked him.  The defects of Sam Hughes were\r\nof the sort that soldiers love.  He was a man's man.\r\n\r\n\"Tipperary\" was just becoming popular to whistle when a camera man\r\nauthorized by the Government of Canada took one of the most striking\r\npictures in our part of the war outside the zone of the shell areas.\r\nGen. Sam Hughes, jack boots and oilskin cape flung back by the gale to\r\nshow his belt and the flap of his khaki, wide-legged on a rope ladder,\r\ncoming down forward from a troopship in the Gulf, almost baring his\r\nteeth to the October wind; bidding farewell to the First Contingent\r\n33,000 strong, that steamed out of the Gulf into the convoy.\r\n\r\nYou recognize in such a picture a man who perhaps understood the\r\nsensations of Alexander.  Sam Hughes had finished his first job for the\r\nwar.  Among all the war achievements that thrilled nations when big men\r\nsuddenly took hold of them in after years, this one holds its own.\r\nHughes never could match it again.  Here was the greatest army that had\r\never put out to sea at one time; an army forty per cent bigger in three\r\nmonths than the total force that Gen. Ian Hamilton estimated Canada\r\ncould send as her whole contribution to a great war.  This was Hughes'\r\nanswer to Hamilton.  Not only were the men Canadian--if not many of\r\nthem Canadians--but their uniforms, boots, kits, rifles, horses, tents,\r\nartillery, machine gun batteries, army waggons, cook waggons,\r\nengineering outfits and munitions, were as far as possible produced in\r\nCanada.  Troop trains and transport steamers were Canadian.  The money\r\nthat paid for the army was Canadian.  The pay of officers and men was\r\nCanadian.  And we know what Hughes was.\r\n\r\nBut the moment Hughes let go the rope ladder that should have made him\r\nLord Valcartier, he began to undo his own career.\r\n\r\nIn a misguided speech afterwards Sam reminded Lord Shaughnessy that to\r\nraise, equip and dispatch the First Contingent from Canada was a\r\nheavier contract than building the C.P.R.  The comparison was foolish,\r\nbut very human.  Shaughnessy had provoked it by announcing to the\r\nGovernment that he intended to make a speech in condemnation of Hughes'\r\nmethods of recruiting.\r\n\r\nThe author of Canada in Flanders describes exactly what the work of\r\norganizing that Contingent was.  A few extracts will do:\r\n\r\n\"In less than a month the Government, which had asked for 20,000 men,\r\nfound almost 40,000 at its disposal. . .  General Hughes devised and\r\nordered the establishment of the largest camp that had ever been seen\r\non Canadian soil.  The site at Valcartier was well chosen. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"The transformation effected within a fortnight by an army of engineers\r\nand workers was a remarkable triumph of applied science.  Roads were\r\nmade, drains laid down, a water supply with miles of pipes installed,\r\nelectric lighting furnished from Quebec and incinerators built for the\r\ndestruction of dry refuse.  A sanitary system second to none that any\r\ncamp has seen was instituted.  Every company had its own bathing place\r\nand shower baths: every cook-house its own supply of water.  Troughs of\r\nwater for horses filled automatically so that there was neither\r\nshortage nor waste.  The standing crops were garnered; trees cut down\r\nand the roots torn up.  A line of targets 3 1/2 miles long--the largest\r\nrifle range in the world--was constructed. . . . .  Camp and army\r\nleaped to life in the same hour.  Within four days of the opening of\r\nthe camp nearly 6,000 men had arrived in it.  The cloth mills of\r\nMontreal began to hum with the manufacture of khaki, which the needles\r\nof a great army of tailors converted into uniforms, greatcoats and\r\ncloaks.  The Ordnance Department equipped the host with the Ross Rifle.\r\nRegiments were shuffled and reshuffled into battalions; battalions into\r\nbrigades.  The whole force was inoculated against typhoid.  There were\r\nstores to accumulate; a fleet of transports to assemble; a thousand\r\nsmall cogs in the machine to be nicely adjusted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Max Aitken did not mention the message to \"My Soldiers\" in every\r\nman's knapsack, an imitation of Kitchener's knapsack message to the\r\n\"Old Contemptibles\"; or that he himself had applied to Sam Hughes for a\r\n\"job\" in Canada's army.\r\n\r\nHughes was Minister of War, not a Minister of Defence.  In the tramp of\r\nbattalions down the street he felt Canada to be a young nation, not an\r\noverseas Dominion only.  Yet the First Contingent was the work of one\r\nof the most scientifically unprepared-for-war peoples in the world.\r\nValcartier was the glorification of Hughes, who was always personally\r\nprepared for war; what or where he was not always sure, except that it\r\nwould involve the Empire, that when it came, the sand-bags of Canada's\r\nfront line would not be in Canada, and the Canada Militia Act would be\r\nas useful in the case as a page from Pickwick Papers.\r\n\r\nAllow for the British-born majority in the First Contingent, the\r\npatriotic enthusiasm of Militia officers, the commandeering of national\r\nresources and the great work of subordinates; the fact remains that had\r\nhe not been as much his own enemy as he was a soldier born and bred,\r\nSam Hughes should have been Lord Valcartier.\r\n\r\nThe sad fact about Hughes is that he did not estimate what Canada did\r\nand did not in her first impact upon the war.  He could not see Canada\r\nexcept as the shadow of Sam Hughes.  In the light of the war as he\r\nstood in front of it, that shadow of Hughes seemed to him to cover the\r\ncountry.  For two years, it seemed to grow.  Then it flickered.  In\r\n1916 it went out.  And there never was in Canada a going out like it.\r\n\r\nHughes was the embodiment of force without power.  He began to mobilize\r\na nation, not merely as battalions on parade, but as an army equipped\r\nby Canadian science, industry, transportation, intelligence, and\r\ncitizenship.  So far as he carried that out, the editor of the _Lindsay\r\nWarder_ and M.P. for Haliburton and Victoria had no superior in\r\norganizing force in this country.  Up till 1916 he was a patriotic\r\ncannon-cracker exploding without any particular objective, except that\r\nhe wanted a Canadian Army in Canada, not an overseas Contingent, or an\r\nImperial Army.  between 1914 and 1916 he was a great organizing\r\nsoldier, at his best comparable to any men who were doing wonders at\r\nthe front.  As Nationalist as Quebec, he thought of Canada as a unit in\r\nthe Empire, most of which he had seen for military reasons.  Canada\r\ncould not declare war; but in the mind of Hughes the force that held\r\nCanada and other overseas dominions within the Empire was not in trade\r\nand tariffs, but in ships, armies and victories.\r\n\r\nSam Hughes failed to translate his force into power because he failed\r\nto estimate the elements which carried him to success, and therefore\r\ncould not measure the energies that would defeat him.  He never\r\nunderstood what Bismarck called the \"imponderables\".  Nature gave him\r\nthe energy; Fate the ambition: Destiny denied him the vision.\r\n\r\nThe electric energy of this nation in response to the call of war made\r\na flash that blinded Hughes.  He seemed to think that he was the man\r\nwho was running the cataract.  He had a wholesome contempt for\r\nKaiserism in Germany.  He tried to express it by an imitation of\r\nKaiserism in Canada.  He had a sense of relative omnipotence.  He put\r\neditors in jail, went over the heads of District commanders,\r\ninexcusably humiliated General Lessard in command of the most important\r\nmilitary district in Canada, openly browbeat officers in front of their\r\nmen, played Napoleon on a white charger at the crest of a mound in\r\nValcartier, and trod on the official corns of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nSuch things are now somewhat blurred by perspective.  At the time they\r\nwere glaringly in the spotlight as the pranks of a Jack the Giant\r\nKiller.  In December, 1914, Premier Borden made a tactical visit to the\r\nheadquarters of Military District No. 2, nominally commanded by General\r\nLessard.\r\n\r\nA military writer had this to say about the Premier's speech:\r\n\r\n\". . . .  He thought the accomplishment of this task (Valcartier) was a\r\ntribute to the spirit of the people.  He claimed no special credit for\r\nhis Government; inferentially it was a high compliment to the\r\norganizing ability of the Minister of Militia, but Sir Robert deftly\r\nleft that to the imagination of his audience. . . .  A curious feature\r\nwas his avoidance of any mention of the 'Minister of Militia.'  When he\r\ndesired to speak of the military programme, he stated that he had\r\ndecided, after consultation with the 'Chief of Staff'.  This was done\r\nrepeatedly and apparently with definite purpose.  Once he mentioned the\r\nname of Major Lessard, and a shout went up from the audience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther quotation is not needed.  In less than two months after the\r\nglorification of Valcartier, the Premier found himself challenged by\r\nthe man who had already begun to act as though national headquarters\r\nwere in the Militia Department.  Sam Hughes was never unpopular in\r\nToronto.  The incident referred to might almost have taken place in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nCanada was beginning to understand, to heroize and to censure Sam\r\nHughes.  His measure was being taken here.  But the censure was\r\nunheeded.  Hughes worked while critics talked.  He was mobilizing, if\r\nnot organizing, a nation.  He still believed that he (ipse) could do\r\nit.  The mobilization included everything needed by the army as well as\r\nthe army itself.  He wanted to get the nation behind the army: and\r\nhimself behind the nation.  He started everything--even to shells, high\r\nexplosives and aeroplanes.  Hughes knew what the army needed.  He\r\nrefused to admit that other men also knew how to get some of these\r\nthings better than he did.\r\n\r\nCabinet colleagues were adjuncts.  The motto punctuated by the smashing\r\nfist was, \"I want to tell you!\"  No major on parade ever felt so\r\noverwhelming.  Hughes was more than a martinet.  He was a dilemma.  The\r\nphenomenal was always about him.  War was not even hell to Sam Hughes.\r\nIt was more often a chance to show a civilian minister that he was a\r\nmere conventional ornament.  Hughes may have hated the necessity, but\r\nhe loved the spirit and the fire, of war.\r\n\r\nSam Hughes was probably wiser on what modern war demanded than many of\r\nthe British command.  Even Kitchener argued for shrapnel when Lloyd\r\nGeorge wanted high explosives.  There was no civilian in Canada to\r\nargue against Hughes, who aimed to do in Canada what the Minister of\r\nMunitions, Director-General, Headquarters Staff, and the Minister of\r\nTransports did in England.  He was able from the first to get a\r\nrealizing measure of the kind of mechanical hell known as modern war.\r\n\r\nStart a force like that and you may expect abnormalities in the wake of\r\nit.  We had \"Sham Shoes\".  Hughes had nothing to do with those.  He\r\nstated in Winnipeg that Wellington had once said that a contractor who\r\nmade bad boots for an army should be shot.  We had shell contracts--and\r\nthe \"friend\" Joseph Wesley Allison; the Kyte charges, which brought the\r\nMinister home from England to answer them in the House.  Neither the\r\nanswer nor the friend was characteristic of the kind of man we had\r\nsupposed Sam Hughes to be.  We had the Ross Rifle.  Hughes knew that in\r\nactual warfare the Ross was the finest sniper's rifle in the world, but\r\nthat in quick action it jammed so badly that often the Canadians\r\nfurtively swapped them for Lee-Enfields whenever the chance came.\r\nThere was no excuse for the Ross rifle, and Hughes ought to have\r\nadmitted it.  There never should have been a chance for any detractor\r\nof his to insinuate that the Minister had stock in the Ross Rifle\r\nCompany.  We had cellulose nitrate and Grant Morden, who has never had\r\nan equal over here for making sudden wealth out of next to nothing and\r\ngetting popular credit for doing it.  What the ex-Minister of Militia\r\nmade out of that promotion was never stated.  It never should have been\r\nnecessary for him to have made a copper in any such way.  On his\r\nretirement from the Cabinet Hughes should have had a big honourable\r\nendowment from the nation sufficient as an income for the rest of his\r\nlife.  The whole idea of such a character being even good-humouredly\r\nmixed up with any deal not absolutely foursquare is a paradox.  The Sam\r\nHughes that we knew best was as straight as a chalk line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exploits of Canada's army never surprised Hughes.  He had always\r\nsaid they could do it.  He boasted about the generals he had taken from\r\ndesks and offices.  But the generals were fighting.  There was a cubist\r\npicture in the War Memorials at Ottawa thus described by a Canadian\r\neditor who went over the battlefields which it depicted:\r\n\r\n\"The canvas shrieking with its high hues was filled with Turcos in\r\npanic flight crowding one another in their terror, while over them\r\nbillowed the yellow poison pall of death; but in the midst of the\r\nmaelstrom the roaring Canadian guns stood immovable and unyielding,\r\nserved by gunners who rose superior alike to the physical terrors of\r\nbattle and the moral contagion of fear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat picture of St. Julien must have thrilled Hughes, whose son was\r\nsoon to be Brigadier-General.  It was on the crest of the St. Julien\r\nwave that Hughes got his title and was given the freedom of London;\r\nwhen some delirious writer in a London daily predicted that some day\r\nSir Sam would ride through London at the head of his victorious troops.\r\nOne writer called him the Commander-in-Chief of Canada's Army.  None of\r\nthese things moved Sam Hughes to humility.  As well as any man he knew\r\nhow small the greatest man was in the fury of that war.\r\n\r\nOther Cabinet Ministers had to wait till the Peace Conference before\r\ngetting such press notices.  Even the Premier took nearly two years to\r\nconvince London that he was much more than the civilian colleague of\r\nGen. Hughes.  Sir Sam was idolized from the beginning; at times when\r\ngenerals at the front were baffled, discouraged and beaten, and when\r\npatient old Kitchener was enduring red tape and making perfunctory\r\nreports to the Lords, knowing that the war was bigger than his\r\nknowledge of it.\r\n\r\nHughes may not have been wise enough to estimate the real value of this\r\nidolatry; but he was probably shrewd enough to know that it would soon\r\nbe over.  He knew that much as had been done to make Canada a war\r\nnation, the first two years had done less than half the work.  87,000\r\ntroops went overseas in 1915.  That was natural.  The majority of the\r\nmen were in camp.  In 1916 the number was almost doubled, from the\r\nenlistments of 1915.  In 1917 the number sent overseas dropped to\r\n63,536, proving that the enlistments of 1916 had been about half those\r\nof 1915.\r\n\r\nHughes knew this better than anybody.  He knew that the voluntary\r\nsystem, in which he believed, was going to break down.  We had no\r\nnational register.  A country as big as twenty Englands, with a\r\npopulation about one-fourth as big, had also Quebec--and the farmer.\r\nThe Canadian census was five years old and useless for anything like a\r\nnational register of resources of war.  Camp Borden in 1916 helped to\r\nstimulate recruiting and to give Hughes something resembling in a\r\nfeeble way the sensations of 1914.  But Camp Borden was not Valcartier.\r\nGeneral Lessard, whom he had ignored in 1914, was sent down to Quebec\r\nto encourage enlistments.  He went too late.  Wrong men had gone\r\nearlier.  Hughes had never tried to placate Quebec.  But in 1916 he\r\nhimself went down to see Cardinal Begin.  For an Orangeman like Hughes\r\nthat was a desperate measure.  He got what he expected--cynicism.\r\nBegin afterwards issued a letter to the press in which he tried to set\r\nthe clergy above the law of conscription.  No doubt the Cardinal came\r\nat Hughes with the twaddle invented by the Nationalists and later\r\nadopted by Laurier, about enforcing the Militia Act which provided for\r\nnothing but defence.\r\n\r\nCanada had now four divisions in the field.  The problem was how to\r\nkeep them up, and how to send a fifth.  The fifth never went.  But it\r\nstands to the immortal credit of Sam Hughes that the four did, and that\r\nhe had sent them.\r\n\r\nThe affair about the Chairman of Munitions was to Hughes a sore blow.\r\nHe had started munitions as an arm of war.  He did not want a civilian\r\nto take it over as a mere industry.  Even that was a sign that the\r\nvolunteer system was about done.  Ottawa was full of experts now, each\r\nman taking over as a big business something started by Hughes.  The\r\none-man epoch was over.  But Hughes refused to admit it.  The man who\r\nhad started everything was in no humour to admit anything.  Yet in the\r\ndarkest days Hughes never lost faith in the men who had gone.  No man\r\ncontinued to say more heartening things about ultimate victory.  And he\r\nplayed blind optimist against the cold, comfortless fact that the\r\nCanadian Army was wasting and the reserves were not marching up to mend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHughes knew that conscription had to come.  But he was the very last\r\nman in authority to admit it.  Only a few days before Ottawa announced\r\nthat compulsory service must be applied, and when Sir Sam knew it was\r\ncoming, he said publicly to soldiers in Toronto that Canada, the\r\nfreeman's country, would never need conscription.  It was most pitiful\r\nto hear him.  Sir Sam never seemed to pity himself.  His egoism was\r\ngame enough for anything.  Bigger men than he had gone down.  A big man\r\nhere or there was nothing now.  But what of little men that stayed up?\r\nHughes probably asked that in silent contempt as he saw the coming of\r\nCoalition.  But he knew he would not be there when it came.\r\n\r\nBy this time the egotism that was so splendid in 1914 had begun to\r\nbreed in Gen. Hughes rancours and envies and enmities.  Some of the men\r\nhe had sent overseas were now more potent figures than himself.\r\n\r\nThere was still a person at the head of the Militia Department known as\r\nLieut.-General Sam Hughes, K.C.B.  But there was no longer in Canada\r\nany such man as old Sam Hughes.  The Fate chickens hatched in 1914 were\r\ncoming home to roost.  For two years the Government had carried on two\r\nwars, one with the Kaiser Wilhelm, the other with Kaiser Sam.  It had\r\nto be determined that whatever defects government may have because it\r\nis a democracy--even such democracy as was left in 1916--it is bigger\r\nthan any one man.  It had to be conceded that the nation was bigger\r\nthan any one political party, and war bigger than all the world's\r\nvolunteer armies.\r\n\r\nSam Hughes belonged to the eternal Volunteers.  The days of his glory\r\nwere the days when Canada of her own accord went to war or stayed at\r\nhome.  The Force called Hughes dreamed that it was bigger than a\r\nmachine called War.  But the machine won.  Hughes went down.  He went\r\ndown as he had come up--alone.  His going down seemed more swift than\r\nhis rising.  And yet he began to go down when he stood on the rope\r\nladder down the Gulf and watched the troopships drift out.  If in that\r\nmoment he had not dreamed that General Sam Hughes was above government,\r\nhe might have continued his great work long enough to become Lord\r\nValcartier.  He might have helped in a second Capture of Quebec, made\r\nconscription less difficult when it came, and put the Fifth Division\r\ninto the field.  And in that case Canada's part in the war would have\r\nbeen even more magnificent than it now is.\r\n\r\nThe latter days of the General were characteristic of a man who never\r\nknew he was beaten.  Musical geniuses have written tremendous scores to\r\ndepict a man's struggle with death.  None of them could have\r\ntranscended the long battle which Sam Hughes put up to stay here.  For\r\nmonths we had intermittent bulletins from his bedside when any morning\r\nwe expected to read that he was gone.  He was a hard man to conquer.\r\nAnd only his intimate friends are likely ever to know whether or not it\r\nwas his own ultimate biting failure, after his almost super-human\r\nsuccess, that turned this man of the shadow into a phantom before he\r\nlet go.\r\n\r\nAnd before he went the hard, bluff soldier, who has as much iron in his\r\ncomposition as any man of his time sprang one of those human surprises\r\nthat even war fails to emulate--when he listened time after time to the\r\nrecord that he loved better than most music, \"I know that my Redeemer\r\nliveth\", from Handel's \"Messiah\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEREOPTICON AND THE SLIDE\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR ARTHUR CURRIE\r\n\r\nThe war was a great cosmic artist of infinite satire, making of\r\nhumanity little stereopticon slides which he slipped in front of his\r\ncalcium and flashed upon the clouds for a screen.  When the war was\r\ndone the stereopticon was smashed.  The slides remain.  What shall we\r\ndo with them?\r\n\r\nOne of the most world-interesting characters in the magic lantern of\r\nwar was Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Currie, who in 1914 locked his real\r\nestate desk in Victoria, B.C., and in 1919 came back to Canada\r\nadmittedly one of the ablest commanders in a war which made the\r\nexploits of Wellington seem like comic opera in simplicity.\r\n\r\nWhatever partial, prejudiced or private opinions some Canadians may\r\nhave about Sir Arthur Currie, it must be generally admitted that he was\r\nperhaps the most remarkable of all the slides slipped into the\r\nstereopticon of the war artist.  To quote from \"Canada's Hundred Days\",\r\nby J. F. B. Livesay, concerning the secret strategy of Sir Arthur\r\nCurrie for the great Amiens show in August, 1918:\r\n\r\n\"That afternoon the Corps Commander had a talk with the two Canadian\r\ncorrespondents.  Before him was a large scale map and the barrage map.\r\nIt was all very clear and lucid.  We take up our line here; and our\r\nfirst objective is there; 'zero' hour was named; our final objective\r\nfor the day over there--constituting a world record for a first day's\r\nadvance. . . .\r\n\r\n\"So at last all is ready.  The story goes that the Corps Commander was\r\nasked how soon he could deliver the Corps in fighting trim at the\r\nappointed place.  'By the tenth,' he had said.  'Too long; do it by the\r\neighth.'  And he did it. . . .\r\n\r\n\"And it was all done secretly and by night.  For an entire week the men\r\nof Canada were passing south from their old front, taking circuitous\r\nand puzzling routes.  None knew where they went.  They sang as they\r\nmarched--a thing they had not done for two years.\r\n\r\n\"Foremost that night of nights was one's sense of wonder at how it had\r\nbeen done; how of many tangled threads of railway and lorry and march,\r\nall that great and intricate machine--more complex far than Wellington\r\nhad gathered on the field of Waterloo--had been assembled in perfect\r\norder to the minute. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Up the winding hill go all the impedimenta of war--marching\r\nbattalions, traction-engines towing great guns, ammunition trains, long\r\nlines of Red Cross lorries; everywhere the pungent odour of petrol.\r\nFrom every little wood belch forth men.  They march silently.  They\r\nmight be phantoms, dim hordes of Valhalla, were it not for the spark of\r\na cigarette, a smothered laugh.  There is no talking.  All is tense\r\nexcitement.  For miles and miles in a wide concentric sweep every road\r\nand lane and bypath is crowded with these slow-moving masses.  Over the\r\nbare hillsides lumber the heavy tanks, just keeping pace with the\r\nmarching men.\r\n\r\n\". . . .  Berlin thinks we are in Flanders; London that we are in the\r\nsouth.  All is well. . . .\r\n\r\n\". . . .  The watch hand is creeping round--half-past three--four--ten\r\npast four--an interminable laggard.  It is to be the greatest barrage\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n\". . . .  'Zero' is set for four-twenty, and the pointer has barely\r\nreached that figure when behind us there goes up a mighty flare, and\r\nsimultaneously all along the line ten miles to north and south of us,\r\nother flares light up the countryside.  At the same instant there\r\nbreaks out the boom of our heavy guns, the sharp staccato of\r\nsixty-pounders, the dull roar of howitzers, and the ear-splitting\r\nclamour of whizz-bangs--a bedlam of noise.  Shells whistle and whine\r\noverhead; they cannot be distinguished one from another, but merge into\r\na cataract of sound.\r\n\r\n\". . . .  The heavens are lighted up across their broad expanse by a\r\ncontinuous sheet of lightning, playing relentlessly over the doomed\r\nlines.  Now a faint light of dawn shimmers in the east and soon blots\r\nout the fireworks.  A lark rises high, carolling. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The fog lifts.  It is eight o'clock.  The cavalry, a wonderful sight,\r\nappear on the scene.  They have come up from Hangest-sur-Somme and have\r\nlain overnight in the great park of Amiens.  Like a jack-in-the-box\r\nthey have sprung from nowhere--miles on miles of gay and serried ranks,\r\nled by the Canadian Cavalry Brigade.\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1913 side of this Wagnerian stage setting take a look at a real\r\nestate office in Victoria, B.C.  The junior member of the firm is a\r\npink-faced giant who had taught school and made no money, and having no\r\nother qualification for getting ahead in the world, went into buying\r\nand selling houses and corner lots.  Victoria was booming then or he\r\nnever would have done it.  He had maps of the city on his walls and\r\ncould solemnly point out to some timid newcomer in 1913 what little\r\nhouse there or nice wooded lot yonder might suit her; and the\r\nprice--oh, yes, the price; seems high, but the location is excellent,\r\nthe neighbourhood fine, the scenery superb, and the city--well, it had\r\nbeen going ahead until the slump and then----\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Victoria's all right,\" he insists heavily.  \"Got sleeping\r\nsickness, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nThen he yawns, which is a relief to the lady client, who thinks that\r\nhis face is less ugly that way.  Such a huge, long, solemn face!  She\r\nglances at the office, wondering--if the agent is hard up?  If so, no\r\nwonder; for he seems a sad salesman.\r\n\r\nHe closes his desk and locks up.  Off to the rifle ranges, where he\r\nstays as late as the eye can see because--well, it's a joy to help the\r\nmen get bull's eyes.\r\n\r\nSunday--marches in full Highland regalia at the head of the 50th Gordon\r\nHighlanders on garrison parade.  On the curb a twinkling little Jap\r\nwatches him.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin' like him in Japan, John,\" says a boy scout.  \"Wow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Big--so big!\" admires the Jap.\r\n\r\n\"Yah.  Makes them big Macs. in the ranks look shrunk.  Knows artillery,\r\ntoo.  Rifle--kick! got a great eye.  Look at 'im right wheel!\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThen on the 1920 side of the Wagnerian stage picture observe this same\r\ngiant, less baby pink, thinner in the face, clad in evening dress;\r\nInverness cape, crush hat, in the rotunda of the Ritz in Montreal,\r\nbeside an average athletic citizen similarly dressed; the superb\r\ncivilian--and his marionette.\r\n\r\n\"Er--I think the car's waiting, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no.  We'll walk.  Only a block or two,\" booms the giant.\r\n\r\nHe crosses the rotunda in seven swift, great strides, while the\r\nmarionette trots to keep up.  They are off to a function at McGill\r\nUniversity.  The new President--to whom professors bow with frigid\r\npoliteness and ladies ogle in admiring awe, and university governors\r\nstand about like a bodyguard as though to intimate,--\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous?  Not a bit of it.  There's no other university President\r\nlike him.  And what else could we do with him?  The Government had\r\nnothing to suit him; for politics he's never meant; for business never.\r\nGeddes left us.  We picked a greater man.  Yes, it seems awkward, but\r\nnever mind.  A year from now you will say--here was the man that made\r\nMcGill as famous in 1921 as Sir William Dawson, the world geologist,\r\nmade it in 1890.\"\r\n\r\nMontreal that made a citizen of prodigious Van Horne had here a\r\ncharacter in a setting far more unusual.  The eminent soldier as head\r\nof a university.  One of the last surprises of the war; almost as it\r\nseemed then a joker in the pack; when men had to remember how this man\r\nleaped from an almost bankrupt real estate office in Victoria to what\r\nhe was in Canada's Hundred Days.\r\n\r\nOf all men who seemed to have been absolutely created by the war Currie\r\nwas the first.  He enlisted for active service in 1914, and Hughes made\r\nhim brigade-commander at Valcartier.  He was in the First Contingent\r\nthat swung out of the Gulf the day that Hughes stood on the rope\r\nladder, almost forgetting that he had shaken hands with Currie.  He\r\nwent to France as Commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.  Within two\r\nmonths came St. Julien and the green gas when Currie held his part of\r\nthe stricken line from Thursday till Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"And on Sunday,\" said Max Aitken, eye-witness, \"he had not abandoned\r\nhis trenches.  There were none left.  They had been obliterated by the\r\nartillery.  He withdrew his undefeated troops from the fragments of the\r\nfield fortifications, and the hearts of his men were as completely\r\nunbroken as the parapets of his trenches were completely broken.\"  Much\r\nmore was said in official despatches about the fine spectacular heroism\r\nof other officers of lower rank.  Currie, the most picturesque physique\r\non the West front, was no man for mere gallantry.  Poor dashing Mercer,\r\nbeloved of the ranks, later paid the penalty for the sort of bravery\r\nthat inspires troops but does not win battles.  Currie was no coward.\r\nBut he was cautious.  The Scot in him preordained that he might be a\r\nnecessity higher up.  He just flung his left flank around south and\r\nhung on.  We read on in the official record:\r\n\r\n\"Monday morning broke bright and clear and found the Canadians behind\r\nthe firing line.  But this day too was to bring its anxieties.  The\r\nattack was still pressed, and it became necessary to ask Brigadier\r\nGeneral Currie whether he could not once more call on his shrunken\r\nBrigade.  'The men are tired,' this indomitable soldier replied, 'but\r\nthey are ready and glad to go again to the trenches.'  And so, once\r\nmore a hero leading heroes, the general marched back the men of the 2nd\r\nBrigade, reduced to a quarter of its strength, to the very apex of the\r\nline as it existed at that moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFive months later a party of Canadian newspapermen visited the Canadian\r\nfront when one of them wrote concerning Major-General Currie:\r\n\r\n\"English officers spoke of him with a curious mixture of enthusiasm and\r\nreserve as though he were some new sort of being.  It was everybody's\r\nsecret that this big, husky Canadian with the baby pink face and the\r\nblue eyes and the slow, smooth, bellowing voice was to be in command of\r\nthe Second Canadian Division just then being organized. . . .  No place\r\nexcept Canada produces such voices as Currie's, or such tremendous\r\neasy-moving bodies.  He met the newspapermen with a smile and a great\r\noutstretched hand.  The gesture was something like that of a popular\r\npreacher shaking hands with the children on their way out of church.\r\nBut the voice was the great thing.  It seemed to come from illimitable\r\ndepths.  It suggested at once poise and unlimited balance.  Cool\r\njudgment that could never be upset.  Officers who saw Brigade\r\nHeadquarters being strafed and who saw the roof blown in over Currie's\r\nhead whispered among themselves that would be the last of Currie.  But\r\nhe emerged as calm and smooth and pink as ever. . . .  The day the\r\nnewspapermen saw him a very junior officer who has since distinguished\r\nhimself came to report breathlessly, 'That last one, sir, got my tent!'\r\nHe was excited and just a trifle hysterical; but two words from the\r\nGeneral seemed to calm him at once.  'That so?' he said, with the same\r\nquiet interest that a farmer might have received news that a certain\r\nhen had at last laid an egg.  'I thought that last one sounded a bit\r\nclose.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there came to the head of the Canadian Corps a man named Byng, who\r\ncould stroll casually into a billet or a training field to inspect \"the\r\nmuddy trench hounds\" in canvas leggings and with three buttons loose.\r\nUntil Byng came the Canadian Corps was a semi-disciplined and\r\nmarvellous mob of men who could swear as hard as they could fight and\r\nfight like wildcats.  Byng gave then the massive and complex mechanism\r\nof an army competent to conduct operations as a unit of modern war,\r\ndominated by the man of whom the boys sang to the tune of Three Blind\r\nMice, \"Byng Bangs Boche, See how they run!\"  Currie, commander of the\r\n2nd Division, had seen this Corps Commander stroll into a billet and\r\nhurl machine gun questions at the men who jumped like eager school-boys\r\nto answer.  He must have silently envied this genius, who cared far\r\nless than he knew about what was wrong in a kit inspection, but had a\r\nshrewd eye for manoeuvres.  Not often in actual war does a man so\r\npersonally popular organize a cross-section of a vast international\r\ncountry into a war machine called an army, and not seldom do men when\r\nthey hear of such a commander being transferred look at one another in\r\na sort of blank dismay and say, \"Well, I'll be damned.  Now who's it?\"\r\n\r\nOut of the army came slowly and ponderously the huge Highlander, with\r\nthe \"baby pink face\" and the rumbling gong of a voice.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Currie was much too honest to imagine that he or any other\r\nman could make the Canadian army.  It was a heavy ordeal to follow\r\nByng, just as it had been easy for Byng to succeed Alderson.  But\r\nCurrie knew the Canadians down at the root better than Byng knew them.\r\nHe knew how that army had been made: that he was taking over a\r\nhumanized machine that was to war in 1917 what the sword of Wallace had\r\nbeen in man-to-man combat seven hundred years earlier.  He knew the\r\nweakness of men for idolizing a popular commander.  They never would\r\nparody any nursery rhyme in his honour.  Except the Anzacs, they were\r\nthe most audacious army in Europe.  They had become great in defiance\r\nof red tape, insisting on whatever is called Canadianism.  They\r\nembodied all there was of Western independence on that Front.  The\r\nAnzacs, great in fight and in ideas of personal liberty, had not been\r\nwelded into such a machine as the Canadians, whose advertised national\r\nqualities Currie was expected to conserve.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as one lets the cheeky beggars, Canadians from America, have a\r\nbit of quiet, they get uppish,\" was the illuminating sentence in a\r\nletter found in a German trench near St. Eloi.  Currie knew those\r\n\"cheeky beggars\".  In his own elephantine way he loved them, when few\r\nof them could figure it out.  He knew how hard those \"beggars\" could\r\nhit: how grimly they could stick: how madly they could raid and rush:\r\nhow infernally they could scheme to \"put one over on Heine\"; how\r\ndesperately they could abuse earth and heaven when they had time in the\r\nrest billets to smoke fags and write letters home.  They were no army\r\nto go whacking on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt had been all right for Byng the Briton to go among those men with\r\nthree buttons loose.  Men like a touch of insurgency in a commander who\r\nhas come up among the martinets.  Byng was a professional soldier.\r\nCurrie was not yet even a mild insurgent, or was not known as such to\r\nthe ranks.  He was almost a man of prayer.  He moved in a large arc\r\nsomewhat like his great resolute body; an engine of might that never\r\nseemed weary; who at \"Molly-be-Damned\" studied battle reports at two\r\na.m., and was in the field at six.  As he had almost come up from the\r\nranks, the men knew him.  Here and there in a British Columbia\r\nbattalion may have been a man who had bought a corner lot from Currie\r\nin Victoria.  If so, he liked to talk about the hard-up days of the\r\nCorps Commander when he was in real estate.\r\n\r\nCurrie knew that above all things he must keep the confidence of those\r\nmen and that he could never do it by familiarity.  Success was the only\r\nway.  Not, anyhow, speeches.  The C.C. was rather fond of talking aloud\r\nat first; sometimes too religiously.  It was a habit that he never\r\nquite abandoned, though he changed his style as he grew in experience.\r\n\r\nThere was work to do.  No army had more; few armies as much.  Currie's\r\nwas a mobile army; needed as shock troops in rough places--a very good\r\nreputation if not too much of it.  There was danger of the army losing\r\nits Canadianism by being shunted about.  One of Currie's first\r\nobjectives that he wanted above all things to achieve as a Canadian\r\ncommander of initiative, was the capture of Lens.  He had a plan for\r\nthis.  He was never allowed to carry it out.  Says the author of\r\n\"Canada's Hundred Days\":\r\n\r\n\"Thus when he is ordered to abandon his planned offensive at Lens and\r\ntake the corps up the Salient, he refuses point blank to serve under\r\nthe Commander of the Fifth Army.  He is placed under his old Chief of\r\nthe First Army, looks over the ground before Passchendaele and then\r\nprotests against the whole operation as being useless in itself and\r\nlikely to cost the Corps 15,000 men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said by some who believed they knew, that the Lens preparation\r\nwas nothing but a huge feint put up to mislead Heine for an attack in\r\nforce elsewhere.  This was one of the bewildering events of that\r\nbaffling year when the French army was in a state of mutiny, the nation\r\nbehind the army in a state of nerves, and the politicians, clamouring\r\nfor victories--or at least a cessation of defeat.  Something had to be\r\ndone, not only by France but by Britain, whose Premier insisted that\r\nunless the Germans could be broken in the north he could not hold his\r\ncountry united at home.  There was a Council of War--so, a few weeks\r\nbefore the writing of this, said a Canadian General in New York--at\r\nwhich Currie was present.  Sir Douglas Haig unexpectedly arrived and\r\nwas soon into an argument with the Canadian Corps Commander demanding\r\nthat he abandon Lens and strike at Passchendaele.  The two commanders\r\nwere in violent disagreement.  Currie refused to yield.  The British\r\nPremier went to France and met Currie, who gave way to the Premier--as\r\npeople usually did--and, against his own convictions, abandoned Lens.\r\n\r\nThe precise military significance is of less value here than the remark\r\ncredited to Lloyd George, who is reported to have said in England after\r\na subsequent War Cabinet meeting--that in the Canadian Corps Commander\r\nhe had met \"the biggest thing physically and mentally on that front.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Currie was at the head of the Corps no civilian then in Canada has\r\nany means of knowing, except by what men say who were under him or\r\nabout him.  A brawny veteran infantryman, whom I met with his chum,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Currie--oh, yes, he was a good general.  But few of the men where I\r\nwas in the trenches or the billets ever liked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did you see much of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much, begad.\"  His chum nodded agreement.  \"Too awful much,\r\nsometimes.  Why, he used to come into a rest billet almost every day\r\nafter we'd come there all shot to bits with only a corporal's guard o'\r\nthe whole battalion, muddy and tired and sleepy; yes, and what's the\r\nfirst thing we hear, but begad, we've all to shine up and get spic and\r\nspan for parade because the O.C. says the C.C. orders it.  Out we go,\r\nlike a ragbag remnant and he looks us over, says he knows we're tired\r\nand makes a speech----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, boy, them speeches!\" sighs the chum.\r\n\r\n\"Tells us how well we've done and all like o' that, and at the end says\r\nthere's such a devil of a job yonder that he's compelled against his\r\nwill----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, dead aginst his will,\" pipes the chum.\r\n\r\n\"To intimate that he'd like us to trail back to the show and do it some\r\nmore for the sake of the victory and the good long billet we'll get\r\npresently.  Yes, Currie was a good General.  He did the work, he got\r\nresults.  But never tell me he was easy on his men--becuz four years I\r\nwas wan o' them.\"\r\n\r\nOne allows in this man's opinion for the tendency to \"grouch\" that\r\nalways appears in veterans who know best how to fight.  Men like this\r\nwere \"fed up\" on the war, of which they never saw anything but the\r\nglimpse of their own sector.  The war was over now, and between the\r\narmistice and getting home many such men had a chance to talk, as they\r\nwearily waited for a ship.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and that capture of Mons,\" says the chum, as he sips a little\r\ndrink.  \"Altogether useless and against orders.  The war was over.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" says the veteran; \"that was a mere trifle, as I see it.  Not one,\r\ntwo, three with the march into Germany.  Begad! if ever I was a rebel\r\nit was then on that 150 miles, says you.  But--'twas so ordered by the\r\nC.C. and we went.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that Gen. Currie believed his army to be rebellious\r\nagainst that march.  He was too much of an insurgent to fear\r\ninsubordination.  He had packed many a pipe-clay parade officer home\r\nfor inefficiency.\r\n\r\nA machine gun officer, who had got a Blighty at Passchendaele and was\r\nasked by the writer what he thought about Currie, admitted that he knew\r\nvery little about him because all he saw at the time was his own little\r\ncorner of the show.  He casually referred the question to two others,\r\none of whom was a H.Q. staff officer, and saw Currie at first hand for\r\nmonths at a time.  The answer was:\r\n\r\n\"I'll say that Currie always inspired me with absolute confidence in\r\nhis genius for modern war.  It was a pleasure just to see him revise a\r\nDivisional plan of action.  He had a hawk eye for any weak spots and he\r\npointed them out.  No doubt some of the stuff that got through to the\r\nboys in some of the shows shortly after Currie took command was Byng\r\nstuff, and Byng sure handed over a fine army to Currie.  But believe\r\nme, Currie had his own programme and picked his own men and developed\r\nhis own machine shortly after.  And I don't believe there was a\r\ncommander in any of the Corps on that Front that had anything on him\r\nfor what makes an army win.\"\r\n\r\nThe General's return to Canada was preheralded by a barrage of\r\ncriticism that seeped through from men coming home.  Some day we shall\r\nknow how much or how little of this was politics inspired by Currie's\r\nenemies in Canada and by men who, jealous of his success and his\r\neminence, had no scruples about fomenting the criticism.  But Currie\r\nmust be judged by what he did with his army.  In that last hundred days\r\nall the armies but the American army were remnants of what they were in\r\n1915.  The wonderful thing about the Canadian army is that in the three\r\nmonths before victory it was an even more terrible arm of war than it\r\nhad been at Vimy Ridge.  After a year and a half of Commander Currie it\r\nwas still the superb fighting machine described in the extracts already\r\nquoted from the battle of Amiens.  For a few of the reasons why it was\r\nso we quote again that same book the writer's estimate of Currie:\r\n\r\n\"But according to the letter of the law he is not a good subordinate.\r\nHe cannot be popular with the powers that be: he is always complaining\r\nabout something; getting his own way or making it unpleasant for people\r\nif he doesn't.\r\n\r\n\"In the panic of the following March (1918 after Passchendaele) he\r\nfinds the Corps is being torn to pieces, its divisions hurried here,\r\nthere and everywhere; orders given and countermanded and then issued\r\nagain.  He protests strongly; the Canadian corps whose value is tested,\r\nmust be kept together; and he wins out.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"Is all this insubordination?  If so, it is a quality that makes for\r\nvictory.  The average Canadian is always willing to \"take a chance\"\r\nbecause he has confidence in himself.  And the Corps Commander is very\r\nmuch of a Canadian.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author does not criticize Currie, though he had so good an\r\nopportunity.  In telling so well the wonderful story of that last\r\nhundred days and so explicitly glorifying the Commander whose best work\r\nof the war was done during that period, he gives us no perspective.  Is\r\nit not just to admit that though the four reduced Canadian\r\ndivisions--with certain attachments--had defeated forty-seven German\r\ndivisions, they had conquered divisions terribly more reduced than\r\ntheir own and absolutely without reserves in either men or materials\r\nand devoid of the last vestige of morale?  The great bluff was about to\r\nbreak.  It was due to have broken sooner.\r\n\r\nWhen the armistice came all the armies but the Canadians laid down\r\ntheir arms.  Currie had not finished his work.  He had planned the\r\nwhole hundred days, beginning with Cambrai, and the apex of that\r\nachievement after the breaking of the infallible Hindenburg line, was\r\nthe recapture of Mons.  He was once more \"insubordinate\".  He did not\r\nseem to pay respect to the armistice.  His men had often said that they\r\nwanted to fight Heine on German soil.  Denied that, at least they\r\nwanted a chance to be part of the army of occupation, as far east as\r\nCologne.  Currie could never have ordered an unwilling army--not that\r\narmy unwilling--to march 150 miles into Germany.  He had an army of\r\nconquest, not of armistice.  But the stereopticon and the slides:\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done with this soldier at home?  How could he be\r\nre-established in civil life?  Thanks to the Administration's\r\npredicament in trying to please both the General and his enemies, here\r\nwas the worst D.S.C.R. problem of the lot.  Thanks to McGill\r\nUniversity, the predicament was removed.\r\n\r\nA sagacious professor in McGill who knows by experience what it is to\r\nget the ear of the public, said when Currie was appointed President\r\nthat almost the entire faculty were opposed to him because the idea was\r\nso ridiculous.  That professor now alleges proudly that faculty,\r\nstudents and management are all convinced that Currie is a wonderful\r\nPresident; that he has revolutionized all existing ideas about the\r\nheadship of a university, that he understands even the academic mind;\r\nthat the _esprit de corps_ of McGill is such as it never was.\r\n\r\nIn short, nobody is left to remark--\r\n\r\n\"I say, what a pity Geddes left us in the lurch!\"\r\n\r\nThey are making a new stereopticon for that slide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COAT OF MANY COLOURS\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN WILSON\r\n\r\nAfter a life of wearing Joseph's coat, Sir John Willison, ex-editor of\r\nthe _Toronto Globe_ and of the _News_, finds himself President of the\r\nNational Reconstruction Association.  Programme--to reconstruct Canada,\r\nbeginning in 1918, after fifty years of Confederation.\r\n\r\nA supercilious editor once asked why on such an Association no farmer had\r\nbeen appointed.  The answer was simple enough.  Sir John was born a\r\nfarmer.  He used to wield a handspike at logging bees in Huron County,\r\nOnt.  Why no Liberals?  But Sir John used to be the leading Liberal of\r\nunelected Canada.  Why no professor of political economy to represent the\r\ngreat universities who are always supposed to be reconstructing a nation?\r\nSimple again.  Sir John himself once conducted a university of culture,\r\neconomics and general information known as the _Toronto News_.  In fact\r\nthere was no need of an Association at all.  Sir John Willison was\r\nsufficient unto the day.\r\n\r\nOne finds it tolerably easy to be sarcastic about Sir John Willison,\r\nbecause for many years he was to some of us the sort of man that\r\ncompelled a sincere, almost idolatrous admiration.  In this also he is\r\nmore adept than the average man.  He himself once idolized Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier in two volumes; but a few years before he turned all his\r\npolitical guns on the French-Canadian Premier to get him out of power for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn all Canada there has never been a more versatile character; never one\r\nwho after a _volte face_ in politics could turn with such poise and\r\ndignity upon any critic cradled in the foundations of belief and ask,\r\n\"Well, what's new?\"\r\n\r\nFrom his crisp manner of speaking and a certain austerity of manner, I\r\nused to think that Sir John was in a measure inscrutable.  He had such a\r\ncurt way of summoning a reporter, as once,--\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" he began when the culprit had got into the corridor facing the\r\neditor-in-chief, \"never, when interviewing a man in his own home, say\r\nanything about the furniture.\"\r\n\r\nBorn a Conservative and a farmer, Willison became on the _Globe_ Canada's\r\ngreatest unelected Liberal.  He conserved Liberalism.  On the _Globe_ he\r\nheld the balance between the Free Traders who believed only in\r\nreciprocity and Brastus Wiman, who with Goldwin Smith made Taft a mere\r\nplagiarist when he said that Canada was an \"adjunct\" of the United\r\nStates.  It was Willison's attempt to consider commercial union on its\r\nmerits that made the _Globe_ seem like a mark for the annexationists, at\r\na time when the high priest of the movement in Canada had the effrontery\r\nto remain a citizen of the nation which he was openly trying to sell at a\r\nbargain counter.  The man who kept the _Globe_ from becoming an annex to\r\nGoldwin Smith in 1891 had an experience that would fit any man to become\r\na protection-tariff Chairman of Reconstruction, and to remember the\r\nsirens that tempted Ulysses.\r\n\r\nNobody could have predicted in those days that the great editor of the\r\n_Globe_ would live to become first an Independent, next a Tory, and at\r\nthe last a Liberal-Unionist.  And perhaps none of these transformations\r\nwould have been necessary if Sir George Ross had not tried the trick of\r\n\"32 years in the saddle\" from the days of Mowat; to do which and to\r\nremain politically virtuous was an impossible feat, even though the\r\nPremier of Ontario was a director of the _Globe_.  Ross remained\r\ndirector, and also Premier.  But it seems that Mr. Willison saw in such a\r\ndual role a greater inconsistency than even he deemed to be worthy of so\r\nbrilliant a man.  As he could not remove the director, he took what\r\nseemed to be a providential opportunity to remove the Premier.\r\n\r\nThe reconstructed _Toronto News_ was the opportunity.  The elimination of\r\nRoss was the first result.  The removal of Laurier was the necessary\r\nsequel.  The first was a pleasure.  The second must have been a pang.\r\nBecause of the first, in place of Sir George Ross, Willison had as\r\nfrequent visitor to his sanctum James Pliny Whitney, the new Premier of\r\nOntario, \"honest enough to be bold and bold enough to be honest.\"  From\r\nthat to Toryism was merely opening a door.  It took the new Tory editor\r\neight years to remove his old idol Laurier, the result of which was a\r\nsort of intense and bigoted animosity to the Province of Quebec which Sir\r\nJohn is now learning to overcome.  When the Tory _News_ became a\r\nNorthcliffe Imperialist organ it was inevitable that Sir John should\r\nconvert his common hostility to the western Laurier-Liberals into a\r\npolite suspicion of the Radicals who were becoming Agrarians.\r\n\r\nWhen finally, weary of mere politics in which he was our greatest\r\njournalistic expert by instinct and experience Sir John left the _News_,\r\nhe was free to engage in work of a more practical character than writing,\r\nand to become Chairman of the Government's most important branch of\r\nactive agenda outside of professional politics.\r\n\r\nIn all these Protean changes of makeup, if not of character, Sir John\r\nWillison has never abandoned two early habits; lawn bowling and reading\r\nthe _Globe_.  He is an expert in both.  Bowling vexes him least, because\r\nits rules never change.  The _Globe_ gives him pangs because alas! it is\r\nnow engaged in the unpardonable effort to merge the Liberals with the\r\nNational Progressives as a greater Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nInconsistency may be the evolution of greatness.  Inconstancy never.  The\r\n_Globe_ of a certain date in June, 1921, contained a front page display\r\nof the Agrarian bye-election victory in Medicine Hat.  On another date\r\nthere was an editorial once again advising the Agrarians to make common\r\ncause with Liberals against the common enemy, Meighenism, or as it might\r\nbe said, Willisonism.\r\n\r\nPerusing the _Globe_ in his Reconstruction office, Sir John glances\r\nup--leisurely at a spot on the wall, next to the portrait of Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald.  Like Macbeth's dagger, he sees a cold, organizing face\r\nsmiling like Mona Lisa, fair at Sir John; the face of T. A. Crerar.\r\n\r\nThe Levite of Reconstruction shakes his fist.\r\n\r\n\"Down with you,\" he mutters.  \"Avaunt!  I'll have none of you.  There's\r\nnothing under Medicine Hat--except what Kipling said, 'all hell for a\r\nbasement,' Natural gas, Crerar, not a test case at all.  Oh, no.  Too\r\nnear the border.\"\r\n\r\nSir John yawns and peruses a proof of the 745th pamphlet issued from\r\nReconstruction, total of nearly seven million copies paid for not by\r\ntaxation of the people, but inferentially by tariffs.  Probably a very\r\npatriotic minority read these Willison bulletins aiming to reconstruct\r\nthe country by putting a crimp in the exportation of the Canadian dollar,\r\nlooking after welfare work in factories, women and children, grappling\r\nwith unemployment, helping to change over industry from war to peace,\r\naiming to \"stabilize\" the nation, to curb that team of wild horses,\r\nBolshevism and Agrarianism, and generally to keep Canada from going to\r\nperdition.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Sir John, in 1919 and 1920, people bought Canada almost\r\nbankrupt on the exchanges.  Hence among the items in the cheapening list\r\nmay be placed the Canadian dollar which is now worth about 89 cents in\r\nNew York.  That is what happens to the dollar when it goes away from home\r\nand plays prodigal son.  What Sir John works to see is Canadian\r\ncommodities crossing the border and the Yankee dollars coming back in\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the greatest moral issues of the age for this nation.\r\nEven the preachers, if they could see us put up the barriers against\r\nluxury imports from the United States--said to be such a wicked\r\nnation--would breathe more easily.  People so often buy sin done up in\r\ndutiable packages.  For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1921, Canadians\r\nwent into debt to the United States over a million a day--adverse\r\nexchange.  Nearly $400,000,000 in one year spent for Yankee goods more\r\nthan Yankeedom spent buying goods from us.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the need for the rationalizing philosophy of Sir John\r\nWillison, truly our most versatile expert on tariffs from the _Globe_\r\nreciprocity down to the Reconstruction.  Beginning in 1917 with Foster's\r\n\"economic unity\" in North America, a friendly Democratic tariff had let\r\nCanada send certain natural products into the United States free of duty.\r\nPrivate interests found it profitable to handle Canadian trade, much of\r\nit in transit to Europe in a state of high demand.  The democratic\r\nelement in Sir John must have approved that.  Grit as he used to be, Sir\r\nJohn must believe in letting the great United States practise free-trade\r\nif it be so disposed.  Those good Democrats!  Had they not enacted the\r\nUnderwood tariff, what a mountainous load must have been imposed upon the\r\nAtlantean shoulders of Reconstruction!\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the eve of Dominion Day, 1921.  Sir John was not\r\nbowling; he was reading the _Round Table_ for June--at least if not he\r\nshould have been--an article on the meeting of the \"Imperial Cabinet\".\r\n\r\n\"Mischievous title!\" he mutters.  \"It's an Imperial Conference of\r\nPremiers.  John S. Ewart will be sure to make a kingdom article out of\r\nthat.  Very ill-advised.  Er--Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Evening paper, Sir John,\" says the boy.\r\n\r\nSir John takes up the paper and is at once confronted by an item which\r\nconvinces him that if ever Canada needed protection from the United\r\nStates, now is the time.  The item is the repeal of the Underwood tariff.\r\nAccustomed for life to unpleasant sensations from printed pages, his face\r\ngives no sign of emotion.  Swiftly he reads through, flings the paper\r\ndown and looks up.  At once he rises, glaring coldly at the Crerar\r\npalimpsest on the wall.  Again that Mona Lisa exporting smile, as the\r\nlips seem to say:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir John--what will be the Republican Reconstruction price of the\r\nCanadian dollar now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" Sir John snorts into a handkerchief, like a Tory squire.  \"That\r\ntariff, Sir, is not a menace, nor a prophecy of agrarian victory at the\r\npolls.  It is a challenge to this nation.  Canada will not let down the\r\nbars.  We shall put them higher!  Keep the Canadian dollar in Canada.\r\nSell our natural products to Britain.  Build up our towns and our\r\nindustries.  Utilize our great water powers, the cheapest power in the\r\nworld.  Use our raw material; our manufacturing experience gained in the\r\nwar.  Develop the home market.  Sell more to ourselves and spend our\r\nincomes in countries that do not put up economic barriers against our\r\nproducts.  Without some adequate protection, sir, we are economically as\r\nextinct as the Dodo.  There's but one alternative--commercial autonomy\r\nfrom the United States or commercial annexation.  Nobody but a lunatic or\r\nan Agrarian would ever doubt which of these we shall choose--eh, what's\r\nthat you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait chuckles.  An uplifted hand appears in the unframed picture.\r\n\r\n\"I said, Sir John--put the repeal of the Underwood tariff under your\r\nMedicine Hat.\"\r\n\r\nIn sudden fury Sir John flings the _Round Table_ at the place where the\r\npicture vanished.\r\n\r\nThis may be a whimsical conclusion to the study of a personality so\r\nperplexing and vagarious as Sir John Willison.  But he himself, having a\r\nhigh sense of humour, will appreciate its psychological justice as much\r\nas he regrets its historical inaccuracy.  Sir John has always aimed at\r\nbeing a big Canadian, and he has usually succeeded.  He did his share of\r\ncontribution to right thinking about the war, as he did in vicarious\r\naction when he lost one of his two sons in that struggle.  He could not\r\ndo otherwise, because in spite of his bewildering superficial changes of\r\ncoat, when even his detractors almost admired the dignity with which he\r\nchanged it, Sir John, the Tory at heart, has always been a loyal servant\r\nof his country.  Without him the story of political journalism in Canada\r\nwould be a thing of shreds and patches.\r\n\r\nHe has at various times wielded an immense power usually in the direction\r\nof shrewd, sane thinking about national affairs.  No Canadian editor of\r\nhis time so thoroughly mastered its intricate problems.  He has a faculty\r\nof clear, constructive thinking and a fine style of writing.  With no\r\ncollege education he became a cultured journalist--which is sometimes an\r\nanomaly--though he never showed any zeal for the \"humanities\" and never\r\nknew much about that peculiar sociological phenomenon called the\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nSince he drew away from the farm Sir John has never had a desire to\r\nreturn, even in sympathy.  With a fine sense of humour he has never\r\nrelished reminiscences of the backwoods and the smoke of the log heaps.\r\nHis published \"Reminiscences\" are a fine contribution to our political\r\nhistory, but they show no real sympathy with the rude pioneer life from\r\nwhich the writer came and to which he owes a debt that he could very well\r\ndischarge, if he would write a book about the social and craft life of\r\nthe Canadian farm as it was in the Victorian Era.  There is more national\r\nvitality in the story of that than there is in the programme of the\r\nNational Reconstruction Association.  Sir John has a true sympathy with\r\nthat life, because he knows it has been at the root of all his own big\r\nCanadianism in all its forms.  He is one of the kindliest men alive and\r\nhe writes with great discernment and dignity.  Let him stop writing\r\nReconstruction bulletins and do something of more value to the country,\r\nso that the older enthusiasm of men who used to think he was Canada's\r\ngreatest editor may not althogether die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHATSOEVER THY HAND FINDETH\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH FLAVELLE, BART.\r\n\r\n\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\"  I have\r\nforgotten whether it was Paul or Solomon who said that.  But Sir Joseph\r\nFlavelle, Bart., will be sure to remember.  From the time he was big\r\nenough to carry in wood for his devout Christian mother near\r\nPeterborough, Ont., he was living out that text.\r\n\r\nThe Flavelle family afterwards moved to Lindsay, where the future\r\nbaronet went into business.  Queer little town--to be the home of three\r\nsuch men as Flavelle, Hughes, and Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nA man who has had years of business intimacy with Sir Joseph said to me\r\nonce--under suggestion--\"Yes, you never miss a word he says to you,\r\nbecause he puts everything so clearly, and you admire the big things he\r\ndoes, because he has such a genius for action after he thinks--but\r\nsomehow you are so exasperated when you leave him that you feel like\r\ngiving him a big swift kick.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man who was under him in an organizing position for years\r\nduring the war said: \"Well, the higher critics can say all they like\r\nagainst his methods and his personal peculiarities, but I tell you--I\r\nlike the old boy.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Britain's foremost financial experts in the war said to an\r\ninterviewer: \"Ah, you know Flavelle?  Clev-er man!  Clev-er!\"  That was\r\nnearly twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 Sir Joseph Flavelle had in his Munitions Office at Ottawa a\r\nstaff of 360 accounting clerks working upon thirteen ledgers, each\r\nrepresenting a separate department of the Board, which up till that\r\ntime had placed orders in this country for war material aggregating\r\n$1,60,000,000 [Transcriber's note: $160,000,000?  $1,600,000,000?] in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAt that time an editor wrote Sir Joseph asking for a statement of what\r\nhis Board had done.  Within a few hours of receiving the letter Sir\r\nJoseph forwarded an itemized statement a column long, of which one\r\nparagraph read:\r\n\r\n\"Upwards of 56,000,000 shells have been produced; 60,000,000 copper\r\nbands; 45,000,000 cartridge cases; 28,000,000 fuses; 70,000,000 lbs. of\r\npowder; 50,000,000 lbs. of high explosives; 90 ships built, or under\r\nconstruction aggregating 375,000 tons; 2,700 aeroplanes have been\r\nproduced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stated also that 900 manufacturers had taken contracts in all the\r\nProvinces except Prince Edward Island.  The great ex-Minister of\r\nMunitions himself, reading that report, might have said: \"Flavelle?\r\nYes--he is mighty clever.\"  And Flavelle had been for one year then a\r\nbaronet.  That also was clever; and just in time.  The man who happened\r\nto be in England when war was declared and sold war bacon in August,\r\n1914, was not to be caught napping in 1917; neither after he had got\r\nhis title was he to be found slacking in his marvellous work in 1918.\r\nFlavelle earned a title--even after he had taken it.\r\n\r\n\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do!\"  Yea, verily.  I have been fairly\r\nwell acquainted with Sir Joseph for a good many years.  I do not know\r\nhim.  Yet his altogether uncommon personality has almost frozen itself\r\ninto my memory.  Whenever I see that thick-shouldered,\r\nwhitening-whiskered man of sixty-three hastening afoot up the street,\r\nor driving his little runabout, or wiping his glasses every minute in\r\nsome office, or coming becaped and crush-hatted to a concert, I can\r\nhear that high-keyed, slow voice, the calm dispassionate utterance with\r\nnever a syllable misplaced, and feel the energy of a nature that of all\r\nmen I ever met is the oddest compend of clear thinking, cool judgment,\r\nstrength of grip and juvenility of impulse.\r\n\r\nThe story of his struggle to affluence is not much different in basic\r\noutlines from that of any average, self-made man; differing vastly in\r\nthe character of the man.  A year after he was forced out of Lindsay by\r\nboycott because of his Scott Act campaign, the freezing of a car of\r\npotatoes on a Toronto siding almost wiped out his business.  Frankly\r\nand modestly, yet with a sort of fatalistic assurance, he discusses the\r\nkind of man he thinks himself to have become since he lost those\r\npotatoes.  He denies that he has ever been interesting; rather\r\nbewildered that at one time or another people have taken such a\r\npeculiar interest in him.  He talks of his early struggles, the economy\r\nof bacon, and the bigotries of Old Testamentarians in the same concise\r\nlanguage set to the same unvaried monotony of voice.  If you should\r\nfail to follow him, he would almost chide you for not paying attention.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty years ago I met a preacher keenly interested in Flavelle.\r\nHe told me a story repeated to him in a sort of admiring deprecation\r\nthat very day by a Methodist preacher from Toronto who had a gift for\r\nelevated gossip.  This story was probably out of the Apocrypha, as it\r\nconcerned a very worldly episode in the joint experiences of Mr.\r\nFlavelle and another Canadian financier on a visit to Chicago, when the\r\nlatter got a wire stating that a certain conditional donation of his to\r\na small church in Ontario had been unexpectedly covered by the\r\ncongregation with the stipulated equal amount, and that it was time to\r\nsend the money.  It was said that he showed the wire to Flavelle; that\r\nthe two financiers took joint action on the Stock Exchange; and that\r\nthe money was wired immediately.  The little details about the\r\ntransaction I omit, partly out of deference to the preacher who bandied\r\nthe yarn--wherever he got it.  He probably only half believed it\r\nhimself.  Even ministers will gossip.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about Sir Joseph's religious affairs.  He has had\r\nmany.  He has been in publicity over a few, such as the controversy\r\nbetween the late Dr. Carman, his old adversary, and Rev. George\r\nJackson, his then pastor, whom he defended.  Flavelle has never\r\nconcealed his enthusiasm for the church.  He has entertained many a\r\ncelebrated minister.  He has been prominently identified with Missions,\r\nwith the Methodist Book Room--that sadly unecclesiastical\r\ncorporation--with debates in Conference on amusements and other things,\r\nwith Methodist education.  In all these he has practised the text,\r\n\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do.\"  The church needed Flavelle's\r\norganizing hand.  He generously lent it.  He could not do otherwise\r\nwithout being untrue to his own prodigious and inherited passion for a\r\ncertain kind of organized religion.\r\n\r\nThe personal faith of a public man is no business for the critic,\r\nexcept where that faith becomes public works.  Sir Joseph has been\r\nconspicuously aligned with the militant work of the Church.  It has\r\nbeen the belief of those who know him, casually or intimately, that his\r\nphilanthropic works were inspired by his faith.  But many men have had\r\nas much faith with less works, because of too much dissipating emotion.\r\nSir Joseph with all his juvenility of impulse had a way of hitching his\r\nemotions up to a job.  The church needed organization.  Other\r\nwealth-getting Methodists were prominent in pews, public donations and\r\nconferences.  Flavelle believed in the seven days' work.  He had a\r\nprogramme of action for the Sabbath.  Church, social work, business,\r\nwere to him very much one thing; all in need of organization to get\r\nresults.  He had no use for the idle church and less for what he called\r\n\"the dead hand\"--referring to the influence of his old adversary, Dr.\r\nCarman, who thought it presumption in a wealthy pork-packer to regard\r\nhimself as a critic of clerical authority.\r\n\r\nIt is tolerably certain that had Flavelle made less of a business of\r\nreligion, the public would have had less business condemning him on the\r\nbacon inquiry evidence.  Here was a man who all his life had been a\r\ntremendous organizer of the church and a professor of a peculiarly\r\nactive faith, president of a company which in one year had made an\r\nalleged profit of $5,000,000 on a capital investment of less than\r\n$14,000,000.  Bacon at that time--1917--cost the consumer 50 cents a\r\npound.  The price was considered outrageous.  Bacon afterwards went to\r\n80 cents at a time when nobody blamed Sir Joseph; and when he had\r\ndisposed of his interest in bacon altogether.  But the alleged\r\nextortion of this powerful and baroneted Christian stuck in the public\r\nmind.  Bacon was the pioneer in exposed \"profiteering.\"  O'Connor's\r\nreport was made public at a time when it was yet the private property\r\nof the Cabinet.  There was politics here.  And the Premier was away.\r\nOther men afterwards made much more amazing profits that never were\r\nmentioned in the press; men who never went to church; who had never in\r\npublic said such words as \"let war profits go to the hell where they\r\nbelong.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the actual profit, but the alleged hypocrisy of Flavelle\r\nthat roused the detestation of a large section of the public.  And to\r\nthe end of his life this man will never erase from the minds of many\r\npeople the notion that he was of all profiteers the worst, because the\r\nmost hypocritical.\r\n\r\nThen there was the baronetcy.  For a man who had preached Christ so\r\nmuch this seemed a thin business.  A man's Christianity, if he works\r\nhard at it, becomes advertised without posters.  The world that\r\nmistrusts the church on principle, that only waits the chance itself to\r\nprofiteer and to get social preferment, is quick to anathematize the\r\nman who in a big way seems to corelate church, profits and society.\r\n\r\nThe public are no longer concerned, neither did they understand at the\r\ntime, whether the Davies Co. made 5.05 cents a pound on bacon or 5.05\r\nminus overhead charges, 4.1.  Here was the first \"sinner\" caught;\r\nsentimentally lynch him.  It made no difference then what had been the\r\nman's serious work in philanthropic organization and in public service;\r\nor that for war production he had offered the Wm. Davies plant to the\r\nGovernment to operate at so much percentage to the company; or that\r\nFlavelle himself had no connection with the management and at the time\r\nconcerned knew very little about it.  The public appetite did not want\r\nextenuating facts.  It wanted a victim.  Certain other interests,\r\ncurbed by Sir Joseph in the matter of prices for munition contracts,\r\nwanted revenge.  Under the old system of contracts these men had made a\r\nfairly good start at plundering the nation in its extremity.  Between\r\nthe long-suffering public, who thought they had a reason for hating\r\nFlavelle, and the profiteers who really had such a reason, Sir Joseph\r\nhad an experience that would have tested any man's Christianity.\r\n\r\nHowever, he made no protest; did not resign his post or leave the\r\ncountry, but worked on.  The time came when he could have said, \"Et tu,\r\nBrute!\" to men who with no record for helping the church or organizing\r\nto help humanity had profited far more prodigally than the Wm. Davies\r\nCo.  But he kept silence.  He believed in his conscience that the\r\ncompany buying hogs at competitive prices, and selling in a protected\r\nmarket was ethically A1 at Lloyds.  He still believes so.  His\r\nenthusiasm for the company has not waned.  He admires it even to a\r\npoint of emotion.  The company was not his, but he had made it.  From\r\nthe day that William Davies drove to Flavelle's house in an old open\r\nbuggy and asked him to sell out his provision business to manage the\r\ncompany, till the day it produced about 100 million pounds of bacon\r\nalone, in a year, he had been its energizing head.  The Wm. Davies Co.\r\nwas but the main thing from which he made his money.  Its stock was not\r\nsold on the markets.  There was never any need of capital except what\r\ncame from the business conducted by Flavelle.  There was no wit and\r\nphilosophy in \"The Letters of a Pork Packer to His Son\" that could have\r\ninstructed him in the shrewd business of making a great commercial\r\nconcern out of a little business.  His success in Canada was relatively\r\nequal to that of any Swift in Chicago.  Multiply it by the ratio of\r\npopulation and see.  In one year during the war the Wm. Davies Co. had\r\na bacon output of forty million dollars.\r\n\r\nBut Flavelle never can be judged by bacon.  He could have done as well\r\nat railways or banking or law.  He did even better at munitions when\r\nthere were no profits, not even a salary.  He did as well at any other\r\nform of public service.  No man can justly judge him by commercial\r\nsuccess.  He invested--himself--in everything to which he set his hand,\r\nwith the one exception of the now defunct _Toronto News_, which he left\r\nto the management of other people.  He invested the same self capital\r\nin the commercial concern and in public service.\r\n\r\nAny patient who has been in the Toronto General Hospital will tell you\r\nwhat a wonderful institution it is.  He may not know who made it\r\npossible, or whose genius for order and perfection of mechanism it\r\nexpresses.  Without Flavelle, Toronto, instead of one of the greatest\r\nhospitals in the world, would have had just a good hospital.  Almost a\r\nvillage was pulled down to make room for it, on a site that would suit\r\nthe medical needs of the University.  It needed a strong will to put it\r\nthere, against the opinions of other people; a great hospital on the\r\nend of a slum!  The same will put the great \"Methodist Book Room\" where\r\nit is--against the wish of a majority.\r\n\r\nFlavelle was Chairman of the Commission that reorganized the University\r\nof Toronto.  He had no desire for the work.  The late Goldwin Smith was\r\nalready chairman, much disliking Flavelle for some editorial about him\r\nin the _Toronto News_.  The old professor was feeble.  The Commission\r\nasked Flavelle to replace him.  He consented.  If they thought he was\r\nthe man, he was willing to do the work.  And it was thoroughly done, so\r\nfar as a business brain could direct the reconstruction of a concern in\r\nwhich business system is the anatomy, not the life.\r\n\r\nNo man could sit at a conference with Flavelle and not think hard; or\r\naccept a duty from his committee and not discharge it.  He demanded on\r\nbehalf of the public--service.  No man ever sat on a committee with him\r\nwho had time for badinage.  That man with the slow, high voice and the\r\nsteady look was judging other men by results.  Men came to believe that\r\nwhen there was a public task to perform, Flavelle was the man to take\r\nit.  He was almost forced into service, often by the public indolence\r\nof other men.  Canada has always played the professional grandstand\r\nmethod of getting things done for the public.  Before the advent of\r\nRotary and Kiwanis Clubs our two chief cities systematically advised\r\nthe humble philanthropist without pull to go to such men as Flavelle,\r\nEdmund Walker, one of the Masseys, E. R. Wood, J. C. Eaton, Thomas\r\nShaughnessy, Herbert Ames and P. S. Meighen--because these men were in\r\nthe habit of doing or giving or organizing for the public interest,\r\nwhich is supposed to be a game for experts, not amateurs.\r\n\r\nFlavelle's investment in things that made him no money was one of great\r\nability, hard work and conscience.  His returns on such capital were in\r\nthe efficiency and usefulness of things which he had helped to create;\r\nthe need for which he had observed as clearly and calmly as ever he had\r\nforeseen the scope of a great business.\r\n\r\nYet for much of his life he has been a creature of impulse, powerfully\r\nattracted by things not in business.  He left his seat once in a great\r\nBuffalo hall to stand at the door that he might judge the effect of a\r\ncertain decrescendo from a choir.  To a group of musical enthusiasts in\r\nChicago he suddenly suggested a trip to the Cincinnati May Festival.\r\nSpeaking to the boys of Upper Canada College, he drew from his pocket a\r\npiece of putty to illustrate the plasticity of character.  Standing\r\namid heaps of luggage at the docks in St. John, he looked at the\r\nimmigrant sheds and said, \"What a very human picture!\"  Pocketing the\r\nproof of an hospital article, which as proprietor of the _Toronto News_\r\nand Chairman of the Hospital Board he had withdrawn from publication,\r\nhe said to the reporter, \"Old man, a place of suffering should not be\r\ndescribed in the language of the racetrack.\"  When Pastor Wagner,\r\nauthor of \"The Simple Life\", was in Toronto, he was the guest of Mr.\r\nFlavelle, who for a time was as much absorbed in the peasant\r\nphilosopher as he often was in the \"Meditations\" of Thomas à Kempis.\r\n\r\nConsidering these impulses to express himself, it is not hard to\r\nunderstand how Sir Joseph came to say to the Toronto Board of Trade\r\nthat war profits should go to the hell to which they belonged.  He was\r\nspeaking under a sense of emotion.  All through his enormously\r\nsuccessful career he had been energized by a sudden enthusiasm to take\r\nhold of something, and afterwards to make it go.  \"Whatsoever thy hand\r\nfindeth.\"\r\n\r\nFlavelle's hand found many things.  Among them was the _Toronto News_,\r\nhis one recorded failure.  This also was an impulse; precisely the same\r\nas had led him years before to subscribe $5,000 to a fund for the\r\nbetter education of the Tory party.  The _News_ cost him one hundred\r\ntimes as much, for much the same reason on a larger scale; and he lost\r\nit.  But he has never regretted the loss, because he gained the\r\nexperience.  The _News_ did a valuable work.  But its rather Utopian\r\nresurrection had a sad sequel in Toryism such as Flavelle never could\r\nhave endorsed, and its ultimate extinction seemed to prove that\r\nnewspapers cannot be operated by ideals.\r\n\r\nAgain, reconstructing enthusiasm followed him to Ottawa.  He went there\r\nat the instigation of the Imperial Government.  Whether he himself made\r\nthe original suggestion of the need, I do not know.  But he obeyed the\r\nneed when he saw it.  Impulse drove him to meet it in the greatest work\r\nof public organization ever done in so short a time in this country,\r\nexcept the sending of the First Contingent.\r\n\r\nFlavelle had never liked Ottawa.  Ordinarily he had a sort of contempt\r\nfor its waste of time and its dissipation of morality.  It is not\r\nconceivable that he would have taken Munitions under any Canadian\r\ndepartment.  Nor was it necessary.  Canada was to produce munitions for\r\nmuch more than the Canadian Army.\r\n\r\nThe work was vast and varied; the man at the head of it capable,\r\nexacting and impartial.  His sole aim was to produce and to export\r\nmunitions at a price high enough to attract industry and low enough to\r\nprevent profiteering.  For three years he was the superman of Canada's\r\nindustrial fabric.  The C.M.A. and the Department of Trade became mere\r\nannexes to munitions, at a time when Davies' bacon clamoured for\r\nship-room needed by Flavelle munitions.\r\n\r\nOfficial Ottawa had never known a man like this.  He was not popular.\r\nThe Government had no control of him.  Ottawa had never cared for\r\nsuper-men.  Flavelle was there without politics.  He had a department\r\ngreater than any in the Administration.  He was never responsible to\r\nParliament.  Ministers to him were not necessary.  He had no favours to\r\nask of members.  He never even looked in at the Commons which he would\r\nlike to have reformed.  People sometimes ask why such a man does not go\r\ninto Parliament.  Impossible.  He regards government as sheer business,\r\nwhen it is often a passing show.  Foster's Business Conference that\r\nnever met would have caused him to discharge the department for\r\nincompetency.  Sir Thomas White had no desire to lift his eyes unto the\r\nhill Flavelle, the super-Minister who for years had been a critic of\r\nhis own party, and now believed it more inept than ever in spite of the\r\ngreat work of the Finance Minister.  Sir Sam Hughes had never wanted\r\nFlavelle.  There was a good reason.  Sir Sam had started the munition\r\nindustry in Canada as a branch of war, not as a department of mere\r\nbusiness.  Flavelle was all business.  War was business.  There was the\r\nrub.  The nearer the war came to a climax, the more men like Flavelle\r\nat home became part of the machinery.  Foster never could have salaamed\r\nto this super-man of trade and commerce.  Did even Sir Robert Borden\r\never feel comfortable with him?  Back from Europe in a fit of impulse\r\nmore powerful than he had ever known, impressed by the success of\r\nCoalition in England, Sir Joseph wanted to see it established in\r\nCanada.  The nation was united for munitions; why not for national\r\nbusiness?  The Premier was away in the West.  Sir Joseph wired him\r\nasking permission to urge coalition at a certain public dinner.  There\r\nwas no response.  Evidently the Government wanted no advice from a man\r\nwho had nothing whatever to do with it and represented merely big\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nSomething must have caused the Premier to treat Sir Joseph coolly.\r\nAfterwards at the bacon investigation there was cause for a change in\r\ntemperature.  The Premier had been negligent about some documentary\r\nevidence extenuating to the Flavelle presentation of the case.  The two\r\nhad warm words.  Sir Joseph told the Premier one thing which, as it was\r\nrepeated to me without reference to use in publication, had better be\r\nomitted here.  But it was scathing.  Sir Joseph is no mean master of\r\nthe kind of language that hurts.  But he has the Christian\r\nspirit--which in this case he laid aside.  I should like to know what\r\nthe Premier said to Sir Joseph; and precisely what were the Premier's\r\nopinions, before and after, concerning the baronetcy.\r\n\r\nIn his quiet moments Sir Joseph does not rebuke himself more than he\r\nregrets the moral myopia of other people.  I think he is somewhat\r\ndisillusioned as to what it is worth to gain a good deal of the world\r\nat the risk of a lot of people thinking he has lost his soul.  He does\r\nnot believe that his soul was ever in danger of being lost.  Often he\r\ngoes to rugby games.  In this he sees again the virtue of struggle,\r\nprobably wishing he himself had played rugby in youth.\r\n\r\n\"When a man gets old,\" he said lately, \"he loves to sit at home.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Joseph, for all his whitening whiskers and his impatience with\r\nthe shortcomings and animosities of the world, is not yet old.  He has\r\nthe strength of two men, and a power of administration possessed by few\r\nmen in public office in any country.  He has lost some of his bubbling\r\nenthusiasm for the humanities.  The last thing he will lose must be his\r\nfaith in himself: and that is very far off.\r\n\r\n\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do . . . .\"\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Flavelle has yet a strong hand.  What remains that he will\r\ndo with all his might?  If he so desires, more of service on behalf of\r\nthe public good in the ten years he has left than many men accomplish\r\nin a strenuous lifetime.\r\n\r\nIt is time we learned the difference between a public pirate and an\r\norganizing servant of the public.  Take away from this man his public\r\nchurch business, his power to make money, his human vanity over an\r\nhereditary title, and we still have left the story of a big life, much\r\nof it spent in doing good for the sake of other people.  You cannot\r\nefface that strange personality; that desire after all the admiration\r\nof his wonderful ability to administer him mentally \"one good swift\r\nkick.\"  But you will never mentally kick a man of such powerful good to\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO FATTED CALVES FOR PRODIGAL SONS\r\n\r\nHON. SIR HENRY DRAYTON\r\n\r\nWere I a novelist sketching a character for Henry Herbert Drayton I\r\nwould have him, except in one item, just about all that he is not.  He\r\nshould be unmarried, live with his maiden aunt, most of his time make\r\nvery little money and depend for his income upon winning about three\r\ngood criminal prosecutions a year; the rest of his time to be spent\r\nreading up criminal psychology and taking his aunt to see pictures.\r\nThe commonplace scene-shifter who places behind people the scenery of\r\nreal life has bungled Sir Henry, thereby robbing him of much interest.\r\nWhat a net a man with his classic patience and enormous ferret instinct\r\nfor minutiae could have woven about some cunning but once too often\r\nembezzler!  Instead we have Drayton, K.C., pushing himself methodically\r\nthrough a series of legal metamorphoses, at each change getting one\r\nconvolution higher, by public corporation solicitorships and county\r\nattorneyships, burrowing into hydro-electric affairs for Toronto until\r\nhe becomes Dominion Railway Commission chairman--seven years at\r\nthat--and at last steps out into the full glare of undramatic notoriety\r\nby taking office as Minister of Finance in 1919.\r\n\r\nWell, in that capacity he has rubber-stamped millions of people in the\r\nregion of their pockets whom he would have missed altogether had he\r\nbeen taking his maiden aunt to the picture galleries between detective\r\ncases.  Besides, he has three or four children, and I'm sure that when\r\nsome lady writes the cinema of his life she will portray him as a\r\nhugely devoted papa with perfect young geniuses of children who yearn\r\nto spend papa's money upon the very luxuries against which he is\r\nwarning the parents of other young people.\r\n\r\nOnce,--it was something to do with Niagara power--I heard Mr. Drayton\r\nweaving a dull dry web of apparently trivial evidence about some very\r\nimportant people.  It seems to me that one William Mackenzie was a\r\nparticular object; if not he should have been.  Once you admit that\r\nDrayton belongs to corporation instead of criminal law--though\r\nsometimes there's precious little difference--Mackenzie and Adam Beck\r\nare just the sort of audacious public-interest performers that a man\r\nlike him should be after.  He seemed to have an insatiable capacity for\r\npicking out little filaments of dry-as-dust technique from which on\r\nbehalf of an impersonal client like the city of Toronto he could manage\r\nto inveigle a web of silk about any anti-civic despot who regards a\r\ncity as a thing to be worked for dividends, and people merely as common\r\neconomic dots and carry ones.\r\n\r\nHe impressed me then as a born Englishman.  He had the neat, chiseled\r\naccents and the imperturbable air of a perfect gentleman, with a touch\r\nof nonchalance and the suggestion that if at the time of adjournment he\r\nhad just got to the up stroke of a small \"i\", he could leave it there\r\nand come back to-morrow, beginning precisely where he had left off.\r\nBut he was not born in England; only educated there--which is\r\nsomething.  A few more of our public men would be the better for a\r\nlittle Harrowing.\r\n\r\nOnce into public finance, Sir Henry does not propose to be a mere\r\nreverberation of Sir Thomas White.  Never have we had two such drastic\r\nhighwayman budgets as those which Drayton flung at the people in 1920\r\nand 1921.  From the tone of any supplementary remarks which he feels\r\nlike making in order to amuse us while he lightens our pockets, it may\r\nbe worse next year and thereafter unless we have a care.  This man has\r\nnever uttered a soothing phrase since he took office.  He has made no\r\nattempt to furbelow our finances.  He is not even concerned about the\r\nprecise political effect of his taxes and tariffs.  We never had a\r\nFinance Minister who so disregarded the Gladstonian principle, that if\r\nfigures cannot lie they may at least make interesting romances of the\r\ntruth.  In the two years that he has been budgeteering, this dapper,\r\ntailored man with the sailor hat and the truculent jaw and the heavy\r\noutskirts to his eyes has treated a budget as though it were a Santa\r\nClaus stocking to be talked about a long while in advance, so that when\r\nit comes it may be all the more significant.\r\n\r\nSuch budgets as he gives us are not the work of a true Conservative.\r\nThey bear no interesting bigotries of the party.  They deal only\r\nsecondarily with tariffs.  I believe Sir Henry knows that most people\r\nregard a tariff as a very oblique way of reaching the pocket.  People\r\ncompute tariffs and argue about them.  Only the farmers can make them\r\ninto frightful realities.  Nobody understands a tariff anyway when it\r\ncomes to the schedule.  Its chief use is for winning and losing\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Henry's admonishing finger goes up, and we are hushed to see\r\nwhat is the really cruel thing he intends to show us next, that will\r\nhurt just like a thumbscrew.  He smiles and flips down a long scroll\r\nof--direct and drastic taxes quite shocking to contemplate.\r\n\r\n\"This is going to hurt you all, good people,\" he says.  \"But I may as\r\nwell be honest about it.  I am not a financial Christian Scientist.\r\nYou will all feel better after you are properly hurt.\"\r\n\r\nThus far we remember chiefly how it hurt.  We are still hoping to feel\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nDrayton had some grounding in practical finance long before he took any\r\nof the detail jobs that have had so much to do with computations and\r\ncosts.  We are reminded of a little episode of his early youth in\r\nToronto.\r\n\r\nHarry Drayton and Frank Baillie were schoolboys together.  They lived\r\non the same street.  A neighbour was about to have an auction sale of\r\nhis goods, but looking over the lot he made a present of a punching bag\r\nto Harry and Frank, no doubt because he foresaw that they would both\r\nhave strenuous lives.  The boys thanked him and took away the bag.  On\r\nthe way home Harry said to Frank:\r\n\r\n\"Do you really want a share in that punching bag?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so keen as I might be,\" said Frank.  \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he had something else I'd rather have.  Remember that little\r\nprinting press?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what he uses to print calling cards on?\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to go snooks with me and get that, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it certainly would be swell to print our own calling cards,\r\nHarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants $6.50 for it, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  That's different.  Here, let me sell the bag, anyhow.  That'll be\r\na start.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, already budding into finance, sold the bag for one dollar and\r\ntwenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're still shy $5.25, Frank,\" said the coming Finance Minister\r\nof Canada.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it's your move, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I've got an idea.  You wait.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the sprouting financiers met, when Harry had a fine steel\r\ntrout rod.\r\n\r\n\"See that, Frank?  Got that from dad.  Made me a present of it--at my\r\nown suggestion.  What is she worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to fish, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you can sell the rod.\"\r\n\r\nFrank took it and looked it over.\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" he said.  \"I'll sell that for the company.\"\r\n\r\nThere being no guile in either of these young men, the sequel is that\r\nFrank sold the trout rod for $5.25 and Harry proudly took the entire\r\n$6.50 to the neighbour, paid for the press and had it taken home to his\r\nattic, where it must be presumed the two of them spent rainy days\r\nprinting calling cards for Draytons and Baillies.\r\n\r\nCanada took very little interest in Drayton till he came to be Chairman\r\nof the Railway Commission.  But by that time the said Commission was no\r\nlonger the grand court it had been in the days of J. Pitt Mabee.  It\r\nsettled more disputes than ever and settled them as well as ever.\r\nDrayton had almost twice the mileage to cover that Mabee had in 1903.\r\nHe did it with tireless exactitude.  He was less concerned with the\r\nethical issues at stake in decisions between railways and communities\r\nthan with the unethical fact of such a prodigal lot of lines having\r\nbeen built at all to give trouble to the nation.  We were just getting\r\nto the end of the race of the railroads, when thousands of foreigners\r\nhad been dumped into the country with shovel and pick, and thousands of\r\nmiles of new railway built that would shortly be a charge on the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAn able writer a few years ago wrote a series of articles in a Canadian\r\npublication headed, \"Is there a Railway Muddle?\"  Being himself a\r\nrailwayman he seemed to think that the muddle, if any, was chargeable\r\nto conditions over which the railways had little or no control.\r\n\r\nMr. Drayton, shrewdly traversing the network of those prodigally built\r\nrailways, felt no need of asking any such question.  He carried on into\r\nthe slump in business, and on into the war when the Railway War Board,\r\npractising a sort of church union by cutting out competition and\r\nre-routeing traffic for the sake of getting war haulage done as quickly\r\nas possible, left very little for the Drayton court to settle.  But\r\nthere was a bigger settlement to come later, and Drayton was to have a\r\nhand in it.\r\n\r\nAs Chairman of the Commission he never made a statement that was good\r\nfor a headline, or coined an epigram, or lost his temper, or spluttered\r\ninto print.  But on a certain occasion, before retiring from the\r\nCommission, Sir Henry put on record a number of things that the people\r\nof this country read with acute and sustained interest.  This was the\r\nreport of the Smith-Drayton-Acworth Commission for the purpose of\r\nfinding out whether the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific\r\ncould ever manage to pay their own debts, including interest on\r\nmulti-millions borrowed from abroad, or whether, debts and all, they\r\nshould be handed over to the people of Canada?\r\n\r\nDuring the war this nation had many commissions.  Their very names are\r\nmostly forgotten.  Most of them committed themselves to nothing.  This\r\ncommission to investigate railroad bankruptcy was fated to be very\r\ndifferent.  Much of the difference was in Sir Henry Drayton who, had he\r\nbeen asked the question, might have saved the country the cost of the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nBut of course he was prejudiced, and against the roads.  He knew those\r\nroads.  The minority report of the chief of the New York Central made\r\nno difference to the grim bulldog judgment of the Chief Railway\r\nCommissioner--that the two secondary systems of Canadian railways were\r\nalike and for much the same causes constitutionally bankrupt, and\r\nshould therefore be given the nationalizing cure.\r\n\r\nWhat more disagreeable qualification could a man have for being made\r\nMinister of Finance?  The air holes that White had skated around,\r\nDrayton proposed to go right over and to take the people with him.\r\nWhat the common stock of these roads might be worth was for Sir Thomas\r\nto find out.  By the time Sir Henry went to the national ledger that\r\nmatter was all adjusted and the thing left was to raise the money.\r\n\r\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends even when they do not meet.\r\nThe little Houdini of calculations was at last into a predicament where\r\nit seemed that he never could figure himself out.  One fancies him\r\ngazing intently over the Finance Department of whose precise technique\r\nhe knew nothing as yet, and saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Well, White did a wonderful turn.  I don't believe the audience will\r\nlike mine half as well--at first.  No audiences ever do.  I'm bound to\r\nbe more or less unpopular because I don't know how to act a bit like\r\nTetrazzini.\"\r\n\r\nThe great organized orgy was over, when the dollars followed the drum\r\nand the drum thumped at every crossroad; when a Victory Bond in every\r\ntop commode drawer was more necessary than a bottle in every cellar.\r\nThe whole nation, four times tagged for Victory, was once more tagged\r\nfor reconstruction.  Done with credits to England for purchase of war\r\nmaterial in Canada, we were invited to extend credits to war-swept\r\nnations in Europe who would be sure to want things made in Canada to\r\nhelp put them on President Wilson's new map of self-determination.\r\nEven profiteers now admitted everything to be abnormal.  The whole\r\ncountry was like a milkfed pumpkin at the fair.  War wages inclined\r\nevery man to become a profiteer.  The land was teeming with war money\r\nand denuded of necessary goods.  People who used to be content with\r\ngood wages, a plain rented home and a bottle of beer, went out after\r\nshort hours, high wages, French heels, $300 coats and motor-cars.  It\r\nwas part of the emancipation of people for which soldiers had not died.\r\n\r\n\"Er--if you need me, telephone, old chap,\" one fancies Sir Thomas\r\nsaying as he carried Sir Henry's luggage to his room.  \"But I'm sure\r\nyou are the man for the job.  I really have to go back to private\r\nfinance.  However, the super-tariff on imports of luxuries is one thing\r\nwith which you will feel at home, I am sure.  Quite suited to your\r\ntemperament, Sir Henry.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of Scott's novels a gentleman named Front de Boeuf pulls out a\r\nJew's tooth every time he wants more money.  Both our national dentists\r\nknew that a super-tariff on anything is the very thing that makes a\r\nlarge number of well-to-do people want it.  People bought luxuries in\r\nthis country and growled at the high cost of necessities.  Most folk\r\nfeel rather proud of a big price for a coat or a gown or a\r\nChesterfield, if they can get even by skimping on the price of butter\r\nand potatoes.  Low-value money and visions of Utopia had played far\r\nworse havoc with the people than legalized liquor had ever done.  And\r\none of the worst features of the situation was that the bulk of our\r\nluxury buying was done in the country which had the only remaining\r\nstandard of value on the exchanges.  Canada had convenient access to\r\nthe country which alone had a surplus of factory goods.  Our tremendous\r\nbuying average in the American market was even used as propaganda in\r\nthe interest of keeping the peace with Britain.\r\n\r\nHence the devil of exchange and Drayton's dilemma.  The things Drayton\r\nsaid to this country even before he presented his first budget were as\r\ncomfortable as what the doctor prescribes when you are overfed.  On\r\nwent the unpopular luxury tax and sales tax.  The general principle was\r\nthat the more people bought, the more they got out of living, and the\r\nmore they should pay for the privilege.  It was not merely a tax on\r\nimprovements, but an impost on being alive.  Accustomed as we had been\r\nto war taxes which never came off, this was a sanctioned way of\r\n\"passing the buck\" such as we had never known.  The advantage is that\r\nwhen we pay 14 cents for a box of matches that used to cost five cents,\r\nwe can read \"5 cents War Excise Tax Paid\" on the wrapper.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Drayton had no superb suavity with which to beguile those who\r\nmade complaints.  He heard the howlings of all the babies in the\r\nnational dormitory and went ahead.  He did not impress us as a\r\nfinancier, but as a plain doctor of homely common sense.  He said in\r\npublic many things which threw much instructive light upon our buying\r\nand selling.  He spoke some blunt but kindly truths even in the United\r\nStates at whose supremacy in our markets his policy was aimed.\r\n\r\n\"The men who save the world,\" says _The Onlooker_, \"are those who work\r\nby rule of thumb; who do the day's work by the day's light and advance\r\non chaos and the painful dark by inches; in other words, the practical\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a motto might be Drayton's crest.  He is very practical; too much\r\nso to be an interesting personality to the average man.  But by his\r\ndull and diligent practicality he has done rather more than his bit in\r\nhelping to re-establish Canada.  He would, if he could, cut our imports\r\nfrom the United States in half in order to rectify exchange.  Whenever\r\nhe dies the Canadian $ par on exchange will be found graven upon his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nDrayton's tariff tour was one of the most characteristic things he ever\r\ndid.  In this, however, there may have been an element of politics.  A\r\ntravelling tariff commission taking evidence in almost every village\r\nwith a smokestack from coast to coast must have had some real object.\r\nBut Sir Henry had cleaned up most of the possibilities in direct\r\ntaxation; it was time he tackled the tariff, even though he knew it was\r\nlargely a show to satisfy the people that the most patient investigator\r\nin the world at the head of a small court had taken evidence on what\r\nevery Tom and Dick had to say for and against in any part of the\r\ncountry outside of the Yukon.  Had it been practicable to hold a\r\nsession on Great Bear Lake, to determine the trade relations between\r\nthe copper-kniving Eskimos and the meat-swapping Yellow Knife Indians,\r\nSir Henry would have done it.\r\n\r\nSuch vast patience is phenomenal even in Drayton.  One almost fears\r\nthat he is becoming interested in a Federal election.  If so, the end\r\nis in sight.  The day we partyize Sir Henry we shall lose one of the\r\noddest and rarest personal identities we ever had.  But we can better\r\nafford to lose his personal identity in his party service than to lose\r\nboth in putting into the Finance Department in 1922 some idealistic\r\nexperimenter in the efficacy of Free Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONAL EQUATION IN RAILROADING\r\n\r\nEDWARD WENTWORTH BEATTY, K.C.\r\n\r\nThe main thing that E. W. Beatty, K.C., did to help win the war was to\r\nbecome President of the C.P.R.  And he did it well.  A glance at this\r\npolished pony engine of a chief executive suggests that he has never\r\ndone anything but well, and that he is the kind of man likely without\r\npreachments to stimulate well-doing in other people.\r\n\r\nI first met this self-controlled master of executives not long after he\r\nbecame President.  He was most cordial; as Shaughnessy had been\r\naustere.  Under such a direct impression it seemed that I had at last\r\nfound a man who would make the inexorable old C.P.R. become a golden\r\ndoor to humanity.  Of course I was mistaken.  That kind of man is born\r\noften enough, but he seldom stays with his birthright.  I knew that the\r\nrailway of railways was no school for the humanities; but this\r\nuniversity graduate, Chancellor of Queen's, distinguished counsel and\r\npotential eminent judge, bachelor, Canadian born, every inch an athlete\r\nand as rugged as Carpentier, seemed to my aroused imagination one who\r\nwould be as much bigger than the stodgy C.P.R. as that system was\r\ngreater than others of its kind.\r\n\r\nBeatty has not been at his new job long enough yet to prove what I\r\nsuspect--that I was wrong.  But he has been long enough with it to know\r\nthat the surging ideals and aspirations of a young, healthy man in his\r\nown office are pretty rudely shaken down by the practical operation of\r\na great system in a time of financial difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe talked for nearly an hour.  He seemed to have the time and the\r\ninterest.  His big office was as quiet as a library.  His desk was\r\nalmost devoid of signs of labour.  Not a paper to be seen that required\r\nimmediate attention; every item neatly disposed; himself smoking--a\r\nfairly strong pipe; scarcely a telephone call to interrupt.  He seemed\r\nthe sculptor's embodiment of strength in reserve; a man who never could\r\nbe tuckered or peevish or unable to detect either the weakness of an\r\nopponent, the penetration of a critic or the need of a man who came to\r\nask him for advice.  There was a big instant kindliness about him that\r\nwould have won the cordiality of the stolidest of interviewers, as we\r\ntalked about railways, government ownership, the needs of journalism\r\nand the value in business of the personal equation--his own phrase\r\nwhich he repeated so often that it seemed to contain something of\r\nprophetic intention.  He paid his venerating respects to the founders\r\nof the C.P.R., but he seemed to have more enthusiasm for Lord\r\nMountstephen than for Van Horne.\r\n\r\nI heard him say some strong, sincere things about the uselessness of\r\nrich men who would sooner use their money on the gratification of\r\nvanity than upon public service.  He meant that.  He repeated such\r\nthings at various interviews.  In doing so he proved that he himself\r\nhad always made a god of very hard work, discipline and self-denial,\r\nfor the sake of giving his own personality a square deal, without\r\nregard to the money he could make.  He had the strength and he used it.\r\nAs solicitor and chief counsel he became almost a machine to win cases\r\nfor the railway.  He must win, and know how to lose.  Fighting a\r\ncorporation's battles is a good way to believe that the system can do\r\nno wrong.  But I don't think Beatty was ever blind to the native\r\ndefects of the C.P.R.\r\n\r\nRailroading is a great university of character.  Nothing else in our\r\npractical affairs attracts such a variety of men.  None of our\r\nrailwaymen have climbed to the peak of the railway operation business\r\nquite so successfully and so Canadianly as E. W. Beatty.  Most other\r\ntransportation magnates we have imported from either Scotland or the\r\nUnited States.  This one is Canadian from his cradle up.  He embodies\r\nthe best characteristics of the average Canadian in a very high degree.\r\nHe is an amateur athlete whom hard work has never been known to make\r\nweary.  At the end of any perfect day of hard work he has as much\r\nstrength in reserve as he had in the morning when he came to it.  Even\r\nin his talk he wastes never a word, states everything clearly and in\r\nforcible language, but is seldom curt at the expense of courtesy.  He\r\ndoes not talk like any big American executive whose equal or superior\r\nhe may be in administration.  He copies nobody.  The day's work has\r\nalways been his exemplar.  He has no desire for mere personal success.\r\nYears ago he could have made more money by exporting his brains to the\r\nUnited States.  But he preferred Canada where he has made less money,\r\njustly earned more fame, and where he can continue to do more work that\r\ncounts for efficiency in himself and in other people.  He is the kind\r\nof man--like Arthur Meighen--who inspires other men to go in with him\r\non a heavy task to get it done in a big way.\r\n\r\nBeatty's type of mind, though somewhat dry and legal and at times\r\njudicial, is also capable of an immensely quiet enthusiasm that\r\ntransmits itself to other people.  He invites discussion, but not\r\nfamiliarity.  Not personally careful just to maintain traditions, he\r\nprofoundly respects the men who created them--and goes ahead to\r\ntransact business now, and to hand out decisions immediately, that get\r\nto-day ahead of yesterday and as near as possible to the day after.  He\r\nbelieves in the square deal in action and in the high common sense of a\r\ndecision.  There is no public question upon which his opinion might not\r\nbe sanely valuable, though one would never expect him to succeed as a\r\nleader in politics.  As a business reorganizer of McGill University he\r\nis bound to consider a college as a \"going concern\".  As Chancellor of\r\nQueen's, he upsets all traditions as to the dignity of pure scholarship.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a long stride from being Chief Railway Counsel to\r\nbecoming Chief Executive.  But to his practical personality the stride\r\nwas only a step.  On an average this is no lawyer's job.  Judges in the\r\nUnited States can preside over big corporations.  The chief executive\r\nof the C.P.R. works.  He must know the system, its men, its technique.\r\nRailroading is a complex of specialities.  A good president must enter\r\ninto the spirit of the man who builds a locomotive and of one who\r\nconstructs a timetable.\r\n\r\nIt fell to this first Canadian President that the road ever had to\r\nshoulder a load which would have made the wizard Van Horne read up\r\nHercules.  Beatty holds the record for getting through with a programme\r\nthat would have puzzled either of his two eminent predecessors in that\r\noffice.  Shaughnessy at the same age might have done it.  Van Horne\r\nnever.  Yet Beatty never could have built the C.P.R.  His brain has no\r\nwizardry in it.  He is a co-ordination of facts that knows not the\r\nmeaning of magic.  He is the most matter-of-fact man in any high\r\nexecutive position in Canada.  The task he undertook was all cut out\r\nfor him.  Fate decreed that he should take it.  He never dreamed of\r\nrefusing.  And what a task!\r\n\r\nThe greatest trouble Beatty had to face when he became President was\r\ntoo much traffic, too little rolling stock, an almost tragic scarcity\r\nof labour and the McAdoo award in wages.  Railroading costs were at an\r\napex before even munitions costs began to be.  The collapse of railways\r\nin the United States drove a vast amount of traffic over Canadian\r\nroads.  The two younger transcontinental systems were on the verge of\r\nreceiverships.  The brunt of the burden fell upon the old C.P.R., which\r\nat that time, in spite of the McAdoo awards was making a heavy profit.\r\nThe cash value of traffic handled was colossal.  War work was wearing\r\nthe railways down.  New locomotives and cars were hard to get.  Orders\r\ncould not be placed outside.  Canada's railways had to depend on\r\nCanada.  Ships could not wait, though submarines could.  Freight must\r\nmove.  Two hard winters nearly paralyzed all the systems.  No new lines\r\nwere being built.  The old lines were wearing out.  Canada had the\r\nlongest hauls of any nation in the world.  Our systems were built for\r\nthe long haul.  The railway systems of other countries were demoralized\r\nwith wastage, low repairs and enormous traffic.  Even in short-haul\r\nEngland of the easy climate, there was railway paralysis.  But England\r\nhad great gasoline highways and coastal routes when Canada had neither.\r\nIt is said in a report of that period, \"General Superintendents in\r\ncharge of some of the \"key\" divisions of the big roads have had to work\r\nfrom 12 to 20 hours a day to keep roadbed, rolling stock and crews up\r\nto top mark.\"  22,000 Canadian cars were \"lost\" in the United States in\r\none winter.  What war left of the railways winter did its best to\r\ndebilitate.  Industry stole transportation labour at high wages and\r\nrolled out vast quantities of material that had to be moved, when even\r\nC.P.R. efficiency seemed to be just about obliterated from the chart of\r\nthe world's work.\r\n\r\nThis was no time for any man to pray that he might be made chief\r\nexecutive of the greatest transportation system in the world; nor a\r\ntime for Lord Shaughnessy to continue in that office.  The work was now\r\ntoo heavy for the autocrat and for a man whose eyesight was bad.  A\r\nsuccessor had to be found.  The directors did it almost automatically.\r\nThere was but one man to consider; and he had no experience in any of\r\nthe mechanical departments.\r\n\r\nBeatty was the man.  The old autocrat himself had said so; and he knew.\r\nShaughnessy had taken the road from its wizard creator, and made it the\r\nsize and efficiency that it was.  There was almost apostolic\r\nsuccession.  Stories that the Montreal directors favoured one man, the\r\nToronto directors another, and that Shaughnessy gave the casting vote,\r\nwere mere fabrications.  Yet Beatty stated that never in his long years\r\nof experience with the system had he a clear ambition to climb up its\r\nladder.  He never wanted anything but a large day's work--and he got\r\nmany.  But, when he was made Vice-President, he must have known that he\r\nwas the man.  Vice-Presidents on the C.P.R. are not necessarily\r\npresidents to be.  One of Beatty's friends travelling with him up from\r\nThree Rivers once bought him a picture postcard with the legend, \"No\r\nmother ever picks her son to be a Vice-President.\"  Beatty smiled it\r\noff.  He probably knew.  This was one of the rare bits of humour that\r\nillustrated the Shaughnessy regime.  His lordship, fond enough of Irish\r\njokes outside, was never humourous inside the system.  All the humour\r\nin Canadian Pacific was supposed to have died when Van Horne left it.\r\n\r\nBut now and again a gleam of human insight came from the grim\r\nefficiency of the great system, and at least upon one occasion it\r\nflashed from the legal department.  When the Railway Commission was\r\nalmost a new thing under that remarkable square-deal chairman, Joseph\r\nPitt Mabee, the town of Trois Rivieres, Que., had a suit, through its\r\nBoard of Trade, against the C.P.R., involving discrimination in rates.\r\nThe counsel for the plaintiff was a French-Canadian who could read, but\r\nnot comfortably speak, English.  The further he went the more\r\nbewildered the chairman became, until he ventured to interrupt:\r\n\r\n\"I have a suggestion to make to my hon. friend who is having difficulty\r\nin getting me to understand the case.\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was that the solicitor for the railway who had made a\r\nspecial study of the Board of Trade's argument for the sake of\r\ndemolishing it, should himself present that side of the argument in the\r\nclear, concise English of which he is a master; that wherever necessary\r\nthe French counsel should correct the statement; and that afterwards\r\nMr. Beatty should proceed to demolish the argument which he himself had\r\nput up.  The counsel was agreeable.  Mr. Beatty rose to the occasion.\r\nHis statement of the case was so satisfactory to the counsel for Trois\r\nRivieres that he afterwards wondered how Beatty was ever able to\r\ndemolish it and win the case.\r\n\r\nBeatty has no hobbies.  He cares for no art, collects no curios, has no\r\ngreat house, drives no big cars; cares not at all for society; thinks\r\nmore of the Amateur Athletic Association and the Navy League and the\r\nboys of the Y.M.C.A., the athletic equipment of Queen's University and\r\nthe success of Sir Arthur Currie as President of McGill.  He never\r\ntravels for pleasure.  When he goes over the C.P.R., expect results.\r\nThe average Montrealer does not even know where he lives.  He is said\r\nto spend forty minutes a day, indoor weather, at basketball.  In summer\r\nhe camps.  Snapshotted in a sweater he looks like a compromise between\r\nBabe Ruth batting a home run and Hofmann playing the piano.\r\n\r\nWhen Beatty was first a young lawyer in Montreal he was so lonesome for\r\nthe city he came from that he used to go down to the station to see the\r\nToronto train pull in.  He did not dream then that some day he would be\r\nthe man that pulls all the trains in; that from his desk he should have\r\na periscope on the world--every day--the greatest intelligence\r\ndepartment in America.  When he was a school lad in Thorold, afterwards\r\nat the Upper Canada \"Prep.\" (where he got so bad a report that his\r\nfather was advised to take him out of school), he had no idea that he\r\nwould be Chancellor of Queen's University.\r\n\r\nThe system and the man.  Determining which most affects the other is\r\nlike the old problem of the hen and the egg.  But here, anyhow, is a\r\ngreat system.  No man venerates it more than Beatty.  He does not even\r\nconsent to call it a corporation; prefers to think of it as an\r\nassociation, imbued with enthusiasm and loyalty.  Now and then he\r\npublicly discusses national ownership; none can do it better.  He did\r\nit at Thorold soon after he was appointed.  He argued it in Ottawa with\r\nCabinet Ministers.  He did it in Winnipeg.  One suspects that Beatty's\r\nability to do this was one of his qualifications for the presidency.\r\n\r\nA year before Beatty became president a man high up in the system\r\npredicted that the C.P.R. would spend a million dollars to campaign\r\nagainst Bolshevism.  He failed to foresee that the stolid old bulwark\r\nof things as they are would never need to do any such thing.  All it\r\nneeded to spend was Beatty who, within six months of the time he\r\nchanged the sign on his door, had convinced the system that a sort of\r\nnew optimistic vitality had got hold of it.  There was once a cynical\r\nproverb around those offices: \"It's cheaper to buy editors than\r\nnewspapers.\"  One hears very little of it now.  The annual meeting of\r\nthe Directors may be fine copy for the _Montreal Gazette_, but the\r\nyearly banquet of the officials is a matter of real public interest,\r\nespecially to the young President.  There is a psychology in\r\nthis--\"association\"--that is not a corporation.  How does he gauge it?\r\nFrom the officials.  He does not visit the Angus shops; though if he\r\ndid he would be welcome.  It was an old axiom of Van Horne that what\r\nthe head is, so also will the system be.  Beatty extends the axiom--to\r\ninclude the officials.  He would have them radiate optimism, not\r\nparticularly caring that they get it from him.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years optimism has been needed.  C.P. reports are not\r\nwhat they used to be.  Even the stock exchanges tell the tale.  But in\r\ncomparison with American lines, with other Canadian systems--ah! here\r\nis always some comfort.  Trust Beatty to miss no chance of intimating\r\nthat he would much prefer to have real competition from Government\r\nroads.  He fervently hopes for Government ownership to succeed.  C.P.\r\ncannot thrive on weak competition.  He has no fear that any sane\r\nGovernment will try absorbing the C.P.R.  Even farmers, he thinks,\r\nwould soon settle down to a sense of responsibility.  The old pioneer\r\nis a hard organization to make into a tail that does not wag the dog.\r\nSteadily he has advertised to the public that the system is still the\r\nhandbook of efficiency; let Government roads imitate.  National\r\nownership, being impersonal, somewhat Bolshevistic, and very vague,\r\ncannot develop the intensive \"super-loyalty\" of the big private system\r\nvested in a board of directors, and the chief.\r\n\r\nSince ever he became chief Beatty has made this clear; for a purpose.\r\nDid I omit to say that he is the first C.P.R. president without\r\nwhiskers; the first with a college degree; the first Canadian born, the\r\nfirst lawyer, the first bachelor and the first man from Toronto who had\r\noccupied that position; the youngest of all the presidents; that he\r\nused to be an expert at college Rugby; that at Upper Canada \"Prep.\" he\r\nwas much addicted to pugilism; not to mention the discarded tilt of his\r\nFedora?  If so it is because the man himself sets no value on these\r\nthings.  His faith is in the collective personality, called the\r\nCanadian Pacific, built up on the Personal Equation.\r\n\r\nBut Ottawa--what of that?  Almost ever since Ottawa was, the C.P.R. has\r\nbeen said to own it.  Governments of either party have never been\r\ninhospitable to the benign octopus--centipede it became--that had its\r\norigin in the Parliament of Canada and wrecked one Tory Government.\r\nThe penalty of transcontinental railways is that they require to have\r\nmortgages on governments.  Presently the worm turns.  But that usually\r\ncosts more money than the mortgage.  We are now paying off the\r\nmortgages of two great systems.  The C.P.R. mortgage was paid long ago.\r\nThe President of the C.P.R. is usually regarded as second only to the\r\nPremier in point of national management.  But Premiers and governments\r\ncome and go; the President stays on.  Suppose that in the year 19--\r\nthere should be a Cabinet mainly of farmers.  Alberta has a farmer\r\ngovernment.  Saskatchewan with a \"Liberal\" government has a Cabinet\r\nmainly of farmers.  Manitoba sometimes has to remind herself that\r\nPremier Norris is a kind of farmer.  Ontario has a farmer Premier and\r\nmore than half a Cabinet of farmers.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of the farmers' innings.  Suppose that a Cabinet of\r\nsuper-Agriculturists at the Capital some day should not agree with Mr.\r\nBeatty that farmers when they get responsibilities measure up and\r\nsettle down to conservatism.  Such a Cabinet might not remember that\r\nthe C.P.R. had really done so very much for the prairies in comparison\r\nwith what it has got from the West.  It might decree that a lawyer\r\nPresident should be called upon to elucidate why he judges that so\r\nefficient a Personal Equation as the C.P.R. should not be\r\n\"nationalized\", if not government-owned, for the good of the whole\r\npeople, and especially of the people whose traffic creates most of the\r\nrevenues?\r\n\r\nThis is merely supposing.  In any case Mr. Beatty would be master of\r\nthe occasion.  The lawyer who argued against himself and won at Three\r\nRivers might be able to put up a more convincing argument to Ottawa\r\nFarmers than Lord Shaughnessy did to the Union Government when he\r\noffered to amalgamate the C.P.R. with the Government roads providing\r\nthe management should be C.P.R. and the dividends guaranteed.\r\n\r\nBut of course this is a merely hypothetical argument.  There may never\r\nbe a Farmer Administration in Ottawa.  And if there ever should be, we\r\nmay trust to conservative and progressive old C.P.R. to do its share of\r\ninjecting a \"sense of responsibility\" into a Farmer Cabinet to help it\r\nmeasure up and settle down, even if some farmer should buy C.P. shares\r\nenough to get himself elected as a director.  As it stands to-day in\r\nthe estimation of the travelling public, who may or may not care a\r\ncopper about the personality of its rugged and efficient lawyer\r\npresident, the Canadian Pacific is the one greatest proof that Canada\r\nneeds no revolution which will interfere with the morale of that\r\nsystem.  In fact so long as the C.P.R. holds its own an economic\r\nrevolution in Canada is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOURGEOIS MASTER OF QUEBEC\r\n\r\nSIR LOMER GOUIN\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1917, a remarkable dinner was held in Toronto, the\r\nfirst of its kind ever held in that city of Orange Walks.  Protestants\r\nand Catholics sat side by side.  They applauded the same sentiments.\r\nOrator after orator dug into the mines of national idioms.  They\r\ncracked jokes and told stories and worked up climaxes.  The three\r\nhundred rose again and again with glasses of orangeade, and\r\nApollinaris, toasting--Quebec, Ontario, and United Canada.  They waved\r\nnapkins and cheered and sang again and again \"For he's a jolly good\r\nfellow\".  A Methodist minister sat at the back of the room next a\r\nCongregationalist preacher and pretended to unwrap a _de luxe_ cigar.\r\nOrangemen sat at the same table with Catholics.  Macs hobnobbed with\r\n'eaus.  They autographed one another's menus.  The books of songs were\r\nbilingual--French and English.  \"God Save the King\" was sung in both\r\nlanguages.  \"O Canada\" was done in French.  Methodist orators vied with\r\nFrench speakers.  Col. George Denison sat next Gen. Lessard.  They\r\nfraternized as soldiers.  The Methodist local-preacher Premier of\r\nOntario sat with the Roman Catholic Premier of Quebec.  Sentiment ran\r\nhigh.  But no French-Canadian was so emotional as N. W. Rowell, who\r\nglorified the heroes of Courcellette; and no Anglo-Canadian was quite\r\nso stolid, serious and impressive with homely common sense as Sir Lomer\r\nGouin, the Premier of Quebec.  This man spoke slowly, massively, almost\r\ngutturally like a Saxon, in fluent but accented English.  He was far\r\nless excitable than the Premier of Ontario on the same subject:\r\n\r\n  THE RACE UNITY OF CANADA\r\n      PREFIGURED IN\r\n    THE BONNE ENTENTE\r\n\r\nThree hundred public-spirited men of whom eighty came from Quebec were\r\nas one family on this.\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning the concomity broke up.  Not a drop of vin or\r\nliqueur in any form had been served.  The enthusiasm was, therefore, as\r\nnatural as the tide of the St. Lawrence, which in the form of the great\r\nlakes and Niagara does its best to put its arms round the neck of\r\nOntario before it cuts through the heart of Quebec.  To the pure\r\nimagination it was somewhat as though a procession of St. Jean Baptiste\r\nhad suddenly dreamed it was an Orange Walk.\r\n\r\nThis unusual Entente was held between the rancours of the bilingual\r\ndispute of 1916 and the Quebec revolt against conscription in 1917.\r\nThose present who doubted the sincerity of passionate speakers anchored\r\na timidly steadfast hope to the practical, broad-angled Premier of\r\nQuebec, who, had he sat between Mr. Bourassa and the Premier of\r\nOntario, would have inclined his ear to Ontario.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than that four French-Canadian leaders, had\r\nthey been given or had they asked for the opportunity and had acted\r\ntogether, could have put a different face on Quebec's relation to the\r\nwar.  Four men namable in that capacity are, Sir Lomer Gouin, Sir\r\nWilfrid Laurier, Ernest Lapointe, and Cardinal Begin.  Of these, Gouin\r\nwas at that time the most able.  For ten years he had been\r\nuninterruptedly Premier of Quebec with a moral guarantee that he could\r\noccupy the Premiership by an overwhelming majority until he should be\r\ngathered to his fathers.\r\n\r\nAgain and again rumour slated Sir Lomer for Ottawa.  He wisely\r\ndeclined.  He had a peasant's attachment to \"le pays\" and its white\r\nvillages.  In Quebec he was the Chief of Ministers, the little elected\r\nfather of his country.  In Ottawa he would have been perhaps a grand\r\nMinister of Public Works building docks in Halifax, customs houses in\r\nBritish Columbia, post-offices on the prairies, armouries in Ontario\r\nand court-houses in Quebec.  Yes, there would be surely armouries in\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nI met Sir Lomer but once, in his office in the Parliament Buildings.\r\nThere was no particular reason for seeing him except the pleasure of\r\nencountering a descendant of the people who so gallantly fought under\r\nMontcalm so that posterity could enjoy a city in part exclusively\r\nEnglish and for the most part idiomatically French.  A few evenings\r\nprevious I had talked on the Terrace to a glowing Nationalist, a young\r\nexpert in cynical idealism, who spoke very curtly about the Premier.\r\nAn ardent patriot, he talked freely and interestingly, as we gazed out\r\nat the blue-hazed domes of the noble hills that mark the valley of St.\r\nLawrence.  The roofs of Old Lower Town were sizzling in heat.  Drowsy,\r\nlumber-laden bateaux and ocean-liners crept and smoked about the docks.\r\nBeyond the grey-scarped citadel the vesper bells of parish after parish\r\nclanged a divine discord into the calm of the great river.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of Gouin?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\nA cynical smile flicked over the Nationalist's face.  For a moment he\r\ndid not answer.\r\n\r\n\"Pardonnez-moi,\" I mumbled.  \"I am Anglais.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said, sharply, laughing.  \"Have you seen the Montcalm suite in\r\nthe Chateau here?  Do so.  The C.P.R. discovered an old bed and some\r\ncreaky chairs said to have been used by the great general.  They placed\r\nthem in a suite of rooms which they rent to curiosity-hunting Americans\r\nwho sentimentalize over history at twenty-five dollars a day.  Such is\r\nQuebec when she is commercialized into a highway for tourists.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has that to do with Sir Lomer Gouin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Directly--nothing.  Sir Lomer is not even a director of the C.P.R., or\r\nof the Bank of Montreal, though one never knows what he may do with his\r\nmoney and his talents when he gets tired of manipulating elections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean that Gouin--does not reflect the idealism of Quebec; its\r\nlove of the land that bore our fathers, its poetic isolation among the\r\nprovinces----?\"\r\n\r\nHe blew a shaft of cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Lomer,\" he said, \"is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the\r\nProvince of Quebec.  His chief duty is to go about inspecting and\r\nimproving properties and to sit at directors' meetings declaring\r\nprovincial dividends instead of deficits.\"\r\n\r\nI remarked that since Quebec is so prosperous and so large and populous\r\nwith so many cradles, the Premier need not perhaps vex himself deeply\r\nabout ideals such as the French language in schools outside the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" was the reply, as a glass banged upon the table.  \"Would you\r\ncage us in here like Indians on a reservation?  Has the French-Canadian\r\nnation no rights outside Quebec?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\" I asked him.  \"What could you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Secede!\" he exclaimed.  \"Become the Sinn Fein of Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the Pope of Rome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Has as much to do with Quebec,\" he laughed icily, \"as the President of\r\nFrance.  If the Pope should issue instructions to the bishops of\r\nQuebec, asking the clergy to educate the people of Quebec on their duty\r\nto go to war or to vote for either of the old line parties, the people\r\nwould openly disregard them.  We would as much resent the interference\r\nof Rome in our affairs as the American colonies did the tyranny of\r\nGeorge the Third.\"\r\n\r\nHere was the superb inconsistency of the French mind wedded to a single\r\nmagnificent idea.  This Nationalist admitting the possibility of\r\nsecession, made sure that it would not be to the United States which\r\nputs the French language on a par with Choctaw.  When I suggested as a\r\nrecipe for national unity that French and English be learned by both\r\nEnglish and French all over Canada, he flouted the idea of\r\nFrench-Canadians learning more English than they needed in business,\r\nand of English-Canadians learning French at all.  He fervently held to\r\nthe Keltic notion of making a preserve of the French-Canadian race,\r\nlanguage, literature and customs whatever may become of the religion;\r\nyet he objected to penning the race into a reservation like the\r\nIndians.  He observed that in 1911 the Nationalists bucked reciprocity\r\nwith the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I think we should become an independent republic,\" he said as he\r\nplopped a fresh cigarette.  \"We have the main part of the St. Lawrence.\r\nNo, you will not find Gouin say so.  Gouin is a Tory prefect.  He plays\r\npolitics, not nationalism.\"\r\n\r\nI observed that the band was about to play.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, stretching his legs with a yawn.  \"And the concert\r\nwill conclude with that amiable farce, 'O Canada,' followed by 'God\r\nSave the King.'\"\r\n\r\nThis Nationalist interview is given at some length because it\r\nillustrates much of what Sir Lomer Gouin is not, and if he were would\r\nnot openly say so, because he stands for a majority the watchword of\r\nwhich is \"Stop, Look, Listen\".  I went at once to see the Premier.  He\r\nwas closeted with confiding--perhaps confederate--priests, and with\r\nsimple habitant folk who stood, not in awe but in affection, of the\r\nPremier.  He might have been himself a father confessor.\r\n\r\nTalking to him I found Gouin peculiarly on his guard; broad-faced,\r\nheavy-jawed, slow of speech, almost devoid of gesticulation, he was as\r\nunamiably dispassionate as a bank manager.  There was no militant\r\npassion of the minority in this man; no heroic tilting against\r\nwindmills; no expression of ideals; no suggestion of a delightful\r\noutlaw.  He was amazingly practical, with no inclination to discuss\r\nfreely the native peculiarities of either race.  He understood\r\nOntario--as a politician only; England as a democracy and a form of\r\ngovernment.  He had no absorbing idiosyncracies and made no attempt to\r\npose or even to be interesting.  After the bounce of the young\r\nNationalist he was as tame as a grandfather's clock.\r\n\r\nI felt that Sir Lomer was asking himself--what did the stranger want?\r\nHe would have been infinitely more at ease discussing with a bishop how\r\nto prevent a strike in a cotton mill; or with a political outposter\r\nwhat to do to keep some seat for the Administration.  If I had made to\r\nhim such a statement as once I had made with such volcanic results to\r\nBourassa, that nine-tenths of the population in a village like Nicolet\r\ncould speak no Anglais, he would have been eloquent.  Had I observed\r\nthat 70 per cent of the operatives in a great Quebec industry cannot\r\nread and write French, that Ontario has a policy of good roads\r\ncomparable to that of Quebec, that Orangemen do not dominate Toronto,\r\nthat the Ontario farmer is a better producer than the habitant, or that\r\nProtestant clerics do not interfere in politics, he would have bristled\r\nwith information to set me profoundly right.  But he created no\r\natmosphere of free discussion with a stranger.  He was coldly aloof,\r\nyet earnestly endeavouring to say something worth while.\r\n\r\nWhat I really wanted to tell Gouin was that he was personally very much\r\nlike the late great Tory, Sir James Whitney.  But he did not warm up to\r\npersonal comment.  The bilingual question was too complicated.  The\r\natmosphere of the Bonne Entente was lacking.  Gouin and myself were in\r\ndifferent envelopes.  He was the Premier.\r\n\r\nFrom what is said of him I am sure most of the fault was my own.  I did\r\nnot understand him.  He was too much the Premier; the master executive.\r\nThe Nationalist was almost right; Gouin suggested the dividend and the\r\ncensus.  He was the chief executive of a Province larger than almost\r\nany country in Europe but Russia, and with a population about half that\r\nof Roumania, of whom about one-sixth are the Anglo-Saxon minority.  He\r\nseemed to know Quebec from Montreal to the edge of Labrador almost by\r\ntelegraph poles.  You recall that the French in Canada evolved the\r\nmodern census with its intimate penetration into the affairs of the\r\npeople, some time before the Germans did it.  The Premier of Quebec was\r\na handbook encyclopaedia of Quebec.  He knew the precise location by\r\nthe roads of almost any white village, pulp-mill, water-power, mine,\r\ntimber limit; knew as much as a man can about the number of horses and\r\ncattle and cradles to a township; could talk with enthusiasm about the\r\npioneer arts of the habitant--the rugs, the baskets, the furniture, the\r\nhand-made churns, the open-air bake-ovens.  He could give the address\r\nand the full name of many and many a priest.\r\n\r\nBut beyond this there is a Quebec which Sir Lomer Gouin did not know,\r\nbecause he himself with his _bourgeois_ excellences and his great good\r\ncitizenship has not the Gallic sparkle in his mentality.  He never\r\ndeeply knew the soul of Quebec.  He was too much concerned with its\r\npractical and useful politics to be conscious of its passions.  From\r\nthe shrug of his shoulder, and a certain twinkle in his eye when he\r\nmentioned diplomacy with clerics, one surmised that among the clergy he\r\nwas the master among politicians who must walk warily.  But he was too\r\nstout, too thrifty, too much of a high type of budgeteer to be\r\nspiritually informed of the crude but basically beautiful passions that\r\nundercurrent all peasant communities.  There was no poetry in Gouin.\r\nNo fire.  Little imagination.\r\n\r\n\"Those Nationalists?\" he repeated shrewdly, slowly.  \"Yes, I know their\r\ntalk.  Oh, they are not so dangerous, but a troublesome minority.  I\r\nthink--I know Quebec better than they do.  You have, I daresay,\r\nNationalists in Ontario?\"\r\n\r\nWhat he perhaps expected was some statement about Orangemen, who of\r\ncourse are nearly all Imperialists.  Yet these very Orangemen represent\r\nan intense phase of Canadian life; the backwoods era, the simple\r\nindustries, the old villages, the quaint settlements of the U.E.\r\nLoyalists as picturesque on the Upper, as the dormer-windowed villages\r\nof the French are on the Lower St. Lawrence.  To these men the Empire\r\nis as visual, as to the intense Quebecker it is nebulous.  And as the\r\npolitician in Ontario has to regard carefully the Orange vote, so the\r\nPremier of Quebec had to be wary of the franchises of his emotional\r\nfriends, the Nationalists.  He was somewhat afraid of the minority as\r\nall masters of majorities are.  Clearly--it was Gouin's main business\r\nto continue being elected.  Had he gone out on behalf of enlistments,\r\nto educate his people, even to speak for France, he would have been in\r\ndanger of converting Gouin Liberals into Nationalists.\r\n\r\nOntario cannot fail to make an asset of Gouin's anti-Nationalism.  He\r\nwas never for any of the violent doctrines propounded by my friend on\r\nthe Terrace.  He would not oppose Quebec going to war.  I am sure he\r\nGod-speeded the 22nd who died at Courcellette.  He was the Premier of a\r\nfree Province.  Those men had freely gone.  Others--the majority--had\r\nfreely stayed.  But an election was coming; where everybody would be\r\nfree to vote.\r\n\r\nThen there were the clergy; most of them friends of Gouin.  The\r\nCardinal at Quebec had been interviewed by Sir Sam Hughes on aid to\r\nenlistments.  Gouin could have told Hughes that he would fail; that\r\nBegin, though not a Nationalist, was a reactionary.  The bilingual\r\ncontroversy was still acute.  Gouin could not have gone out or sent\r\nemissaries out, to reason with French-Canadians about marching with a\r\nProvince which had denied the French language rights in contrast to the\r\nGovernment's own claim that it had given rights to the Anglo minority\r\nin Quebec.\r\n\r\nConscription was coming.  It was a precarious time.  The master of\r\nQuebec had to move cautiously.  His loyalty to Britain was never\r\nquestioned.  His faith in a United Canada was never doubted.  Had\r\nQuebec been all for Gouin instead of Gouin all for Quebec, the\r\nPremier's way would have been easier.  Better let well enough alone;\r\nencourage those to enlist who really wanted to go--because Quebec was a\r\nfree country.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Laurier influence.  Had the old man gone in with the\r\nPremier to help the Ottawa Government--\r\n\r\nImpossible.  Neither of them was asked before Coalition came on the\r\nheels of conscription.  And when conscription came, the minority of\r\nNationalists opposed to the war became the majority of Quebeckers who\r\npreferred not to comply with the law.  From disregarding the law to\r\nrebellion, to Nationalism was not far.  Gouin had the balance to hold.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal's attitude on conscription made Gouin's position still\r\nmore difficult.  His letter to the press bluntly put the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch above temporal law.  One heard of no rebuke from the Premier of\r\nQuebec to the Cardinal.  A Cardinal may be above politics.\r\n\r\nSir Lomer was playing the game of safety, when from his own temperament\r\nand position and unbacked by other leaders he could do little more.  He\r\nstood for the law and did not hinder its operation.  But if there was a\r\nchief executive in Canada who wished the war were righteously over, it\r\nwas Sir Lomer Gouin.  No Premier had such a predicament; so much at the\r\nend to lose; so much at first to have gained--if only he could have\r\nforeseen, as nobody did, that conscription was coming and that law\r\nwould be more awkward than liberty.\r\n\r\nThe Premier of Quebec had experience in keeping his Government immune\r\nfrom agitators.  It was not alone the Nationalists who had made him\r\nuneasy.  On the other extreme there had been for some time one Godefroi\r\nLanglois, former editor of _La Patrie_, and later founder and editor of\r\n_Le Pays_, whose platform was compulsory State education away from\r\ncontrol of the clergy and in defiance of the Archbishops.  Gouin did\r\nnot endorse Langlois.  How could he?  _Le Pays_, when it condemned\r\nclerical schools, attacked the Administration.  Politically Gouin was\r\nright in opposing Langlois.  Nationally he was playing provincial.\r\nLanglois had a mission, in line with a broader, nationalized Canada;\r\nthe same mission which is now being reflected in the National Council\r\nof Education.\r\n\r\nSo, between the reactionism of Bourassa and the radicalism of Langlois,\r\nGouin was the compromise; and Langlois was conveniently given an\r\nofficial post in Europe.\r\n\r\nGouin has compromised his whole political career.  With the leverage of\r\nenormous success in elections and administration, he never had the\r\nvision to declare himself in favour of a bigger Quebec than could be\r\ngot by extending its boundaries to Ungava.\r\n\r\nHe was too old to begin.  Quebec to him was a vast prefecture to be\r\nadministered; not a vision to be realized.  Ontario--except\r\npolitically--was almost as far away as British Columbia.  He was seldom\r\nin Toronto.  Montreal was as a rule the last west for this voyageur.\r\nHe seldom or never went to the Maritimes.  He knew the people down\r\nthere regarded the _bloc_ Quebec as a denationalizer.  He had little or\r\nno desire to see the prairies.  He wanted Quebec to prosper.  He\r\ndelighted to see pulp mills and cotton factories and power plants and\r\nrailways and trolleys vibrating along the St. Lawrence.  He loved to\r\ndream of the great unpeopled hinterland--all Quebec; of the other\r\nhinterland--all the rest of Canada; of the transcontinentals converging\r\nat Montreal; of the steamship lines terminating there; of a land where\r\nthere are few empty cradles or idle factories or wasting farms.\r\n\r\nAll these things Gouin, growing stout and somewhat heavy of face, loved\r\nto behold; and out of that grew all the vision he seemed to have.  In\r\nthis enormous prefecture within the Empire he beheld a far more\r\ncomfortable State than the Nationalist dream of a separative Quebec;\r\nglad when he could find time to motor grandly and amiably out among the\r\nvillages and be greeted as _le grand seigneur_ of politics, even when\r\nhe lacked the grand manners of the eminent patrician.\r\n\r\nAt any conference of Premiers in Ottawa he held himself somewhat aloof,\r\nstudying the lot, respecting them all, cordial with all, anxious to do\r\nall that constitutionally in him lay to further co-ordination.  But\r\nGouin always sagaciously knew that there was no Premier in the pack who\r\nalready had so much, with so little to ask, from Federalism as he.  His\r\nwas the pivotal province of Confederation, the grand compromise of Old\r\nMacdonald with Cartier; the basic sixty-five members of Parliament,\r\nunchangeable except by ripping up the B.N.A. Act, an instrument of\r\nEmpire.  He could wink the other eye and reflect that from the\r\npolitical concessions of the Act in official bilingualism and a fixed\r\nrepresentation, in the outlet of the St. Lawrence, in the possession of\r\nthe historic city, in the control of ocean navigation, in a solid\r\nclergy, in fundamental virtues of thrift and an established\r\npeasantry--he and his had more than any of the others could ever ask.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said eloquently, with a fine twinkle of his eyes to the\r\ninterviewer at Quebec, \"you have not seen our Province?  Then you must\r\ncome down again, when I am not busy, and let me take you to see--all we\r\nhave down here!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA POLITICAL MATTAWA OF THE WEST\r\n\r\nJOHN WESLEY DAFOE\r\n\r\nFirst impressions are always tyrants.  The first time I heard John\r\nWesley Dafoe talk he was in his large sanctum of the _Manitoba Free\r\nPress_, in the summer of 1916.  He was without a collar, his shirt\r\nloose at the neck, and his hair like a windrow of hay.  He reminded me\r\nof some superb blacksmith hammering out irons of thought, never done\r\nmending the political waggons of other people, and from his many talks\r\nto the waggoners knowing more about all the roads than any of them.\r\nThe wheat on a thousand fields was baking that day, and the 'Peg was\r\nroasting alive.  Since that I have always pictured Dafoe sweltering,\r\nterribly in earnest, whittling the legs of the Round Table and telling\r\nsomebody how it is that west of the lakes neither of the old Ottawa\r\nparties has now any grip on the people.\r\n\r\nDafoe talked that way in 1916.  He was beginning to lisp a little along\r\nthat restless line of thought in 1910.  And in 1940 he may be sitting\r\nin that same sanctum with walls of heavy books on two sides of him,\r\ntelling somebody just how it came to be that an economic cyclone on the\r\nprairies once caught up all the Grits and Tories and nothing was ever\r\nheard or seen of them again.\r\n\r\nWhen Kipling wrote, \"Oh, east is east and west is west, and never the\r\ntwain shall meet,\" he had never met Dafoe.  Some directive angel\r\nplanted him at Winnipeg shortly after Clifford Sifton crowded the gate\r\nthere with people going in that they might choke it again with wheat\r\ncoming out; and while people went in and wheat came out through this\r\nspout of the great prairie hopper, Dafoe dug himself a little ship\r\ncanal which as it grew bigger sluiced the political rivers of the West\r\ninto his sanctum before he lifted the lock and let them on down to the\r\nsea at Ottawa.  The West as he saw it was a place of coming mighty\r\nchanges.  His own party was pushing the transformations.  The prairies\r\nwere due to become the mother of great forces.  You could not be always\r\nherding people into a land like that from south, east and west and not\r\ncome within an ace of fostering some revolution.\r\n\r\nAnd of all cities west of the lakes, Winnipeg was the clearing-house,\r\nas much for policies and programmes as for wheat and money and people.\r\nNo political cloud ever gathered on the prairies that did not get blown\r\ninto Winnipeg before it burst.  Dafoe stood ready for them all.  He\r\nbelieved that no change had happened yet to the Liberal party\r\ncomparable with the changes yet to come.  He saw that party chaining\r\nitself to tariffs and big interests and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, that won't forever do.  There's something just short of a\r\nrevolution going to happen to this party before the West gets done with\r\nit; and if the party isn't ready for the West, so much the worse for\r\nthe party.\"\r\n\r\nJust to get ahead of mere chronology, the bane of many a good man's\r\nlife.  In 1919 the most complete imitation of a little Moscow ever seen\r\non this continent was set up in Winnipeg.  For many weeks it looked to\r\nsome hopefuls as though the Wheat City would reconstruct the whole\r\neconomic structure of the nation to suit the ideas of a violent\r\nminority.  The main recorded issue was \"collective bargaining\".  The\r\nreal issue was direct action in the form of the sympathetic strike.  By\r\nits expected control of urban centres the Soviet organization aimed to\r\nthrottle big utilities, finance, shipping, railroads, telegraphs.  The\r\nUnited Grain Growers were to be but a helpless giant in the hands of\r\nJack Proletariat.  Parliament was to be superseded by Direct Action.\r\nThe A.F.L. was to become obsolete.  Trades Unions were to be taken over\r\nand painted red.  Citizens in starched collars were to become comrades\r\nin shirt sleeves, or enemies.  Political parties would be\r\nreconstructed.  The \"workers\" would own the country.  The British\r\nEmpire would be shaken into Soviets.  The Army and the Navy would be\r\ninternationalized.  The real Capital of Canada outside of Winnipeg\r\nwould be, not London, but Moscow.  The International would supplant\r\nnational anthems.  Public opinion would be exterminated except as\r\nrevised by the Red leaders on the Red River at its junction with the\r\nAssiniboine.\r\n\r\nIn the unfolding of this Great Adventure we pause here to observe that\r\nit was a newspaper which behind the Citizens' Committee administered a\r\nblack eye to this attempt to make Winnipeg the Soviet headquarters of\r\nNorth America and 120 millions of people.  The name of the paper was\r\nthe _Manitoba Free Press_.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Free Press_ was seeing Red.  What business had the Red Flag in\r\na city like Winnipeg at all?  If anywhere in Canada, why not in the\r\nindustrial, big-interest East--in Montreal or Toronto?\r\n\r\n\"One revolution at a time, please,\" we almost hear the _Free Press_\r\nsaying.  \"Now the war is done the West has to settle the fate of\r\nGovernment at Ottawa in its own way.  And the way of the West is not\r\nwith the Red Flag; not with Direct Action.  This city is a headquarters\r\nof evolutionaries, not of outlaws.  You people of the Strike Committee\r\nare trying to get the spot-light when you've no business anywhere\r\nexcept right at back stage.\"\r\n\r\nA perfectly straight argument, though not couched in those words.\r\nDafoe and his associates were profoundly busy with what to them was a\r\nten times greater issue than any form of Soviet anywhere in Canada.  As\r\na matter of record the paper did admit that the metal workers had a\r\nright to strike for collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n\"But no other Union here or elsewhere,\" it thundered \"has any right to\r\na sympathetic strike to help the metal workers.  This city is not going\r\nto be throttled by a thug minority, who want to exercise governing\r\npower as a revolutionary usurpation of authority.\"\r\n\r\nA minority always leads.  Majorities follow.  The position of the _Free\r\nPress_ was, that it is only a minority able to command a majority that\r\nshould rule; and the Soviet was no such minority--while the _Free\r\nPress_ was.\r\n\r\nA clear grasp of this is necessary in the business of judging Mr. Dafoe\r\nand his coming influence upon Canadian affairs.  What Dafoe enunciated\r\nabout the strike will have a strong bearing in the case upon what he\r\nthinks about the Agrarians.  The judge must get a fair judgment.  But\r\nof this later.\r\n\r\nDafoe was, so far as we know, the first editor in Canada to advocate\r\nfrom the beginning of the war a Coalition Government.  This was\r\nnatural.  The _Free Press_ had no faith in the Borden administration of\r\nBob Rogers, owner of the _Winnipeg Telegram_.  By the summer of 1916 it\r\nwas into a Coalition campaign.  A year later when the Premier came back\r\nfrom England declaring for conscription and inviting Laurier to join in\r\na Coalition, the _Free Press_ supported him.\r\n\r\nWhy this anxiety?  We must pull off a bit of the makeup to find out.\r\nThe _Free Press_ was a Liberal paper.  It supported Laurier in the\r\nWest.  But the older it grew the more clearly Dafoe and his associates\r\nsaw that the man who had created the two new Western Provinces could\r\nnot hold them.  Other gods were now arising.  Their organ was the\r\n_Grain Growers' Guide_; their parliaments were in grain growers'\r\nconventions; their policy was radical Liberalism.  The Liberal organ of\r\na Wheat City could not consistently antagonize this radical movement.\r\nThe farmers must be studied.  So far as they could strengthen\r\nLiberalism by becoming a Radical wing, they must be encouraged.  At the\r\npoint where they developed an extreme left away from the party they\r\nmust be checked.  The _Free Press_ which was yet to fight an economic\r\nrevolution must not itself be revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThis leads up to policy in Empire.  The paper had gone against Borden\r\nin 1911.  It was against the taxation Navy of Borden even though it\r\ncould see the danger of war ahead.  It was opposed to the whole\r\nsuper-Tory idea of a centralized British commonwealth of nations.  It\r\n\"hung the hide\" of Lionel Curtis and his Round Table propaganda clubs\r\nto the Canadian National fence.  It argued for \"a progressive\r\ndevelopment in Canadian self-government to the point of the attainment\r\nof sovereign power to be followed by an alliance with the other British\r\nnations\", who it was assumed would do likewise.  For years before the\r\nwar the _Free Press_ had talked of this evolutionary Empire, deeply\r\nregretting that Mr. Bourassa had coined the word \"Nationalist\" and made\r\nit obnoxious.\r\n\r\nWinnipeg seldom does things one half at a time.  In the summer of 1917\r\nJ. W. Dafoe was one of the most astounded men in Canada.  The other one\r\nwas Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  That was the year of the famous Liberal\r\nConvention.  Had such a Convention happened in Chicago with such a man\r\nas Roosevelt as the centre-piece, its doings would have been cabled the\r\nworld over.  In its small way the Winnipeg Convention was more\r\nsensational than the Big Strike two years later.  Mr. Dafoe was in\r\nOttawa that summer.  He was needed there.  The Premier had come back\r\nfrom England primed with a policy of conscription to be enforced by a\r\npossible Coalition Government, an offer of which was made to the\r\nOpposition leader.  Since early in the war the _Free Press_ had argued\r\nfor coalition, but opposed conscription until after the United States\r\nentered the struggle because of the inevitable exodus of slackers\r\nacross the border.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong conscriptionist group of Liberals in Ottawa.  We\r\nmust assume that Mr. Dafoe, though not a member of Parliament, was\r\nstrongly behind them; his presence in Ottawa indicates that his\r\ncounsels were needed in view of the attitude to be taken by Western\r\nLiberals.  It was the conscriptionist group of Liberals in Ottawa that\r\ndecided upon the Convention, whether on the advice of Mr. Dafoe is not\r\ngenerally known.  The intention was to create a Western Liberal group\r\nfree from Laurier control, prepared to consider coalition--involving\r\nconscription--on its merits.  So far, the policy of the Convention was\r\nin line with the previous programme of Mr. Dafoe.  But the Liberal\r\nmachine in the West--which was not Mr. Dafoe's party at all, because\r\nfor some time he had been working on the principle that both the old\r\nparties as such had lost their grip on the West--went out and captured\r\nthe delegates.  The Convention was suddenly stampeded for Laurier, a\r\nresult which Mr. Dafoe never expected but against which he had strongly\r\nurged, the Liberal Unionist leaders.  The _Free Press_ thereafter\r\nthundered against the Convention as entirely misrepresenting Western\r\nLiberalism.  The subsequent South Winnipeg convention shewed that the\r\n_Free Press_ was right.  Almost the entire strength of Western\r\nLiberalism swung into the Union movement and the Coalition, and the\r\n_Free Press_ became a temporary, though independent, supporter of the\r\nUnion Government for the purpose of winning the war.\r\n\r\nNow for the larger front stage view; how does Mr. Dafoe's attitude in\r\nthe defeat of the Winnipeg Soviet idea of government and his former\r\ncampaign against Laurier Liberals match with his attitude towards the\r\nFarmer Movement as embodied by Mr. Crerar?  The leader of the Agrarian\r\nmovement is a friend of the _Free Press_ for much the same reason that\r\nthe strike leaders in 1919 were a foe to it.  Crerarism in the West\r\nlooks for the support of that paper in its drive upon Ottawa.  From his\r\nexperience outwardly to the public, and intimately behind the scenes,\r\nalways concerned with building up a new Liberalism on the wreck of the\r\nold, Dafoe endorses Crerar and his movement.  When Crerar went into the\r\nGovernment the _Free Press_ favoured his going.  Mr. Dafoe clearly\r\nstates that, \"if the Union movement could retain its Liberal elements\r\nand produce an economic and taxation policy acceptable to Western\r\nopinion, we could continue to support it.\"  In contemplating such a\r\nmiracle, did he expect that the ultra-Tories would lop away from the\r\nUnion, making a \"rump\" party to match the Laurier Liberals, and leaving\r\nthe Union Government free to make an alliance with the Farmer Group?\r\nThis we do not profess to know.  In a political age like this almost\r\nany sort of alliance may be made for the purpose of capturing\r\nParliament.  But a permanent alliance between Western Liberalism\r\nrepresented by Mr. Crerar and the Government by Coalition looks now as\r\nfantastic as a Coalition between Lloyd George and de Valera.  Mr. Dafoe\r\nprobably knew that the Government and Mr. Crerar would lock horns over\r\nthe tariff--since any species of protection and free trade never could\r\nsleep together.  When Mr. Crerar left the Government on the budget\r\nissue, the _Free Press_ ceased its active support of the Government and\r\nmoved its guns to a detached position.  When Meighen became Premier and\r\nin his programme speech at Stirling outlined his policy, Dafoe\r\ndefinitely declared himself as no longer in support of the Union\r\nGovernment.  As he could not support the Laurier Liberal party, which\r\nhe had formerly opposed, the only thing left was to make an active and\r\nopen alliance with Mr. Crerar.\r\n\r\nSuch a mobile course of action is incomprehensible unless we keep in\r\nmind the fact that Mr. Dafoe has long found it impossible to support\r\neither of the old parties.  The Coalition was a new one which he\r\nconsistently supported on its merits and up to a point.  The point was\r\nreached.  Unionism and Agrarianism were incompatible.  Therefore\r\nUnionism was a Tory institution; and the only Liberal programme left\r\nfor the _Free Press_ was to form an alliance with Mr. Crerar and his\r\ngreat group of class-conscious Agrarians.\r\n\r\nBy this time, if he reads this, Mr. Dafoe will have observed that we\r\nare trying to corner him on the question:\r\n\r\nIf you were opposed to a Labor Soviet which aimed at making a little\r\nMoscow of Winnipeg, what are you going to do about a Farmer Soviet that\r\naims to capture Ottawa?\r\n\r\nAlready he has begun to answer.  He uses a label for the party led by\r\nMr. Crerar and evolved with the aid of Mr. Dafoe:\r\n\r\nThe National Progressive Party.\r\n\r\nA good name, even if not new.  What is behind the label?  That the\r\nparty so named has now taken over all the Liberal economic traditions\r\nin the West and after the next general election will become the real\r\nLiberal Party of Canada.  In the opinion of Dafoe, Mackenzie King\r\nshould keep out of the West in the coming election in order to let Mr.\r\nCrerar romp home with three-fourths of the entire representation in\r\nParliament.  He alleges that Laurier destroyed the old Western Liberal\r\nparty in 1917; that King has not revived it--though Mr. Fielding might\r\nhave done so; that Western Liberals have become Progressive except in\r\nthe cities, where some have become Unionists.  In making this statement\r\nhe probably reckoned on Michael Clark becoming a Progressive.  But\r\nMichael Clark has turned out to be one species of even Free Trade\r\nLiberal which Crerarism cannot absorb.\r\n\r\nLet us concede that here is one of the most absorbing problems in\r\nCanada.  If Dafoe backs Crerar in the effort to get that preponderant\r\nmajority away from Meighen and King, then he is afterwards committed to\r\nCrerarism.  Dafoe cannot afford to take Crerar and abandon the\r\ntraditions of the _Free Press_.  If he is so keen about real\r\n\"nationalism\" in this country as to regret that Bourassa made the word\r\nobnoxious, he has surely decided that the policy of the N.P.P. must be\r\nto build up a true national life in Canada.  And the man who was\r\nCanada's press representative at the Peace Conference, with such\r\nexceptional facilities for focussing Canadian national sentiment among\r\nother nations, will not dare to countenance in Mr. Crerar and his\r\nfollowers any policy that will open the gates for the United States to\r\nwalk in and walk over this nation as twenty years ago his _Free Press_\r\nassociate, Clifford Sifton, opened the doors to let Europe inundate us\r\nwith a polyglot, un-national flood.\r\n\r\nNo Canadian journalist has shouldered so perilous a responsibility.\r\nDafoe knows what a struggle it is to preserve national identity on a\r\nbasis of one to twelve against us.  Born in Ontario and experienced in\r\nthe East as few editors have ever been, he surely knows the value of\r\nnot surrendering our national birthright for a mess of free-trade\r\npottage.\r\n\r\nIf he knows this as well as we think he should, will he uphold the\r\n_Free Press_ as the constant critic of Mr. Crerar if he attempts to\r\ndenationalize this country; or will he accept a portfolio of Minister\r\nof the Interior in the Cabinet dominated by Messrs. Crerar and Drury,\r\nand in his haste to establish the new Liberalism of the National\r\nProgressive Party help to strike out the meaning of the word \"National\"\r\nin the label?\r\n\r\nCan a man who fought a Direct Action Strike because it aimed at\r\nrevolution, consistently endorse, lock, stock and barrel, a movement\r\nwhich aims at a revolution by Indirect Action through Parliament?\r\n\r\nIs government by a \"National Progressive Party\" Agrarian Group with a\r\nbusiness-farmer Premier and a farmer-dominated Cabinet any less of a\r\ngroup government in principle than the One Big Union, even though it\r\ndoes not tie up the nerve centres of the country by a minority general\r\nstrike, but merely throttles Parliament, which is supposed to be the\r\nnational brain, by the use of the group minority in voting?\r\n\r\nMr. Dafoe has already begun to answer.  Again we see him sweltering in\r\nhis sanctum, his hair like a windrow of hay, as he dictates something\r\nlike this to his stenographer:\r\n\r\n\"Your logic is good except that your major premiss is a case of being\r\noff to a bad start.  The National Progressive Party is not a group; it\r\nis a business majority.  It contains the people who produce the\r\nmajority of the nation's wealth for consumption and export and\r\ntherefore enable the nation to pay its bills.  It is Liberal because it\r\nadvocates free-trade and is opposed to big monopolies, and there is no\r\nother Liberalism in Canada left worthy the name.  The N.P.P. is the new\r\nLiberalism, not for the West alone, but for the whole country.  It\r\ndepends upon the franchise of the people, not upon the strike action of\r\nrevolutionary groups.  Agriculture, not industry, is the basis of\r\nCanada's economics.  Even labour as embodied in the Trade Unions does\r\nnot aim at revolution: Only the Reds want that.  And the Reds are a\r\nhopeless minority.  The farmers are not as yet a popular, though they\r\nare an economic, majority; but the future of this nation depends upon a\r\nvoting as well as a producing majority of farmers.\"\r\n\r\nThis may not be the exact way in which Mr. Dafoe would state the case,\r\nbut it expresses the fact that sound economics are at the root of all\r\nideas which have to do with fair government.  And it suggests that J.\r\nW. Dafoe with his _Free Press_ has more to do than the _Grain Growers'\r\nGuide_ with what the people think about the N.P.P.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we hope that Mr. Dafoe, the judge and the advocate as\r\nwell, will always stay \"behind the scenes\" to keep Mr. Crerar on the\r\nright track if ever he gets the right of way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADMASTER OF THE MANCHESTER SCHOOL\r\n\r\nMICHAEL CLARK, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe eminent headmaster of the Manchester School in Canada is one of the\r\nfew M.P.'s who know how to build a wheat stack.  He farms in the spot\r\nnorth of Calgary where the poplar bluffs begin to mark that you are in\r\nthe black loam of wonderful crops at a maximum distance from Liverpool.\r\nIt is an art to build a wheat stack.  Michael Clark--so we believe--knows\r\nexactly how many tiers to lay before he begins the \"belly\"; how to fill\r\nup the middle so that the butts of the sheaves droop to run off the rain;\r\nand how high to go with the bulge before he begins to draw in with the\r\nroof.  All day long as he worked on his knees, not in prayer, he had\r\nmental leisure to think about one vast, fructifying theme; which of\r\ncourse is Free-Trade as they had it in England; unrestricted trade\r\naccording to the Manchester School.  And when he got his stack done he\r\ncould tell to a ten-dollar bill how much tariff the railways and\r\nsteamships would levy on that stack by the time the wheat got to\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nDuring the War, Clark was a win-the-war Liberal.  He broke away from\r\nLaurier on conscription, which he openly supported.  In July this year he\r\nwas scheduled in the press--another of those wish-father-to-the-thought\r\nnews items--to join Messrs. Drury and Crerar in an anti-tariff tour of\r\nOntario.  He did not go.  He probably never had the slightest intention\r\nof going.  Michael Clark had other wheat to stack.  An Alberta election\r\nwas coming.  It came.  When it was all over Alberta was in the grip of\r\nthe Agrarians.  Liberalism by constituencies was swept out as clean as a\r\nbarn floor at fanning-mill time.  And Michael Clark sat down to think it\r\nover.  He had half expected that tornado.  But he refused to like it.\r\nThe farmers had stolen his own programme of free trade and by means of it\r\nhad stampeded his Province for the sake of using it as a spring-broad to\r\nmake the grand jump into the Federal arena.  The apostle of free trade,\r\nhimself as good a farmer as any of them, was now regarded as a chip on\r\nthe Agrarian stream at high tide.\r\n\r\nWherefore Michael Clark, after certain \"conversations\" with Mr. Crerar,\r\nwrote the letter which, if Mackenzie King is as wise as he is hopeful,\r\nwill be used to flood the country.  Hoardings and electric signs in the\r\ninterests of true-Liberalism should blazon abroad such sentences as these:\r\n\r\n\"The House of Lords, the Family Compact, the Manufacturers' Association\r\nand the junkers and militarists of Germany are each and all examples of\r\ngroup government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Class consciousness is none the less class selfishness, and therefore\r\ndoomed to die, because it suddenly appears in Farmer and Labour parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"The apostles of progress must unite upon common principles, sincerely\r\nheld to resist reaction, which is ever present like a dead weight to drag\r\ndown the aspirations of the race for freedom, justice and democracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"These were the things for which sixty thousand Canadians died in the\r\nrecent war. . . .  I have been fighting 'class' for forty years.  It\r\nwould be quite impossible for me to turn my back on my past and the right\r\nin this election.\"\r\n\r\nOur political history contains no declaration of independence more\r\nsignificant, manly and sensational.  Repudiation of the Free Trade,\r\ngroup-governed, National Progressives by Michael Clark, the farmer and\r\nthe apostle of Canadian Free Trade, is the first truly emancipating note\r\nthat has been struck in all this pre-election barrage of group against\r\ngroup.  Michael Clark may be no bigger as a Canadian for such a stand,\r\nbut he is true to his own form as one of the rarest and manliest Radicals\r\nthat Canada ever had.  And his declaration should be of immense value to\r\nthe Government, which confesses that its real fear is, not of Liberals,\r\nbut of Agrarians.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster of the Manchester School in Canada has had a multitude of\r\npupils; none more brilliant than Mr. Crerar, who seems to have made Free\r\nTrade a species of bondage.  In no other land could Michael Clark so well\r\nhave demonstrated the virtues of Free-Trade.  On those plains, buffaloes\r\nworth multi-millions of dollars in trade annually migrated across\r\n\"Parallel 49\" into Montana and back again into the Territories.  The\r\nprairie schooner trekked northward over the border carrying migrants in\r\nsearch of homes when there was no government official to turn them back\r\nor to question the terminus of their travels.  The freight wagons creaked\r\nup from the south into MacLeod and past it into the valley of\r\nSaskatchewan, carrying goods made and bought in the land of the Western\r\nYankee long before the great antidote to Free Trade, the Transcontinental\r\nRailway, put those crooked trails out of business.\r\n\r\nClark was spouting free-trade on the prairies at a time when many men in\r\nthe West scarcely knew that trade had any restrictions except in the\r\nmatter of beverages.  He was an apostle of Cobdenism almost before the\r\nTerritories were baptized into party politics at all; when Regina was the\r\nhome of a Territorial County Council that had neither Tories nor Grits.\r\nHe was farming and prophesying commercial union before James J. Hill\r\nbegan to compete with the protective C.P.R. for trade north and south\r\ninstead of the long-haul east and west.  Before ever a real Agrarian\r\nbegan to head out on the plains he was contending like a tribune of the\r\nplebs, that unrestricted reciprocity between two halves of a great\r\nproductive continent, of which one-half contains nine-tenths of the\r\npeople, was not a prelude to annexation away from the grand old Empire.\r\nAnd when he got into Parliament the voice that had been so mighty in the\r\ntrail-side school houses and the little town-halls became more potent\r\nthan ever as \"Red Michael\" went full tilt in the House against the high\r\nprotectionists.\r\n\r\nHigh courage was here.  Bucking bronchos from the West who had gone to\r\nOttawa were duly corralled, haltered, hobbled, surcingled and thrown,\r\nfinally harnessed and driven by either of the old parties.  In breaking a\r\npolitical broncho the Liberal party was as good as the other.  But the\r\nHouse is full of insurgents now, lining up into a tyrannized and\r\ntyrannous group organizing as a party.  In Clark's inaugural days, and\r\nfor years after, there was but one real solo voice calling like a\r\ntrombone from a high tower for Free Trade as the Kingdom of God which, if\r\nthey would first seek it, all other things would be added unto them.\r\n\r\nFrench psychology traces certain forms of insanity to the fixed idea.\r\nThere have been times when Parliament has regarded Michael Clark as a\r\nmelancholy victim of this big idea that warped his whole political\r\nmentality.  But it was a grand form of insanity.  Nobody ever heard Clark\r\nin the House who did not realize that here was a fine British rebel whose\r\nbrain should be a great hope to his party.  The old chief knew that.  He\r\nkept his ear towards Clark when he was sometimes deaf to his ministers.\r\n\r\nClark was the mountain peak which the party had left for its fleshly\r\nsojourn in Egypt.  The Liberal party in Canada had once been a free trade\r\nparty--somewhat before Clark's time.  In free trade and the universal\r\nfranchise had been its life.  But Liberalism before 1896 was one thing;\r\nafterwards another.  Laurier in practice knew that Clark was\r\nmagnificently wrong; in theory superbly right.  Therefore he indulged and\r\nadmired him; sometimes playing with him, conscious that Liberalism was\r\nthe only show in which Clark could be a national performer.\r\n\r\nIn truth Michael Clark was for long enough a man without a party.  But\r\nfrom the benches of the Liberals he could stand and preach his Manchester\r\ndoctrines to Hansard and the nation, even when the party yawned and held\r\ndangerously on to the tariff.\r\n\r\nIt was always a tonic to hear Clark in the House.  Like Carlyle he\r\nbreathed a certain inexorable vitality into public affairs.  To meet\r\nClark in the corridors was to get a breeze that swept like a chinook\r\nacross the frozen waste of old-line politics.  In the gloom of the lobby\r\nthis apostle of red hair and rubicund visage was a beacon light.  I have\r\nmet him so, of a Saturday afternoon when the House was out of session,\r\nand when the member for Red Deer was ripe for a free talk to any\r\nstranger.  A great friendliness possessed him always.  He could laugh at\r\nthe besetments of party and the tyranny that opportunism imposes on great\r\nminds.  He himself was free.  He wanted others to be free.  He could\r\nstand for half an hour in one gloomy crypt of those corridors in the old\r\nParliament and talk of the power of being that kind of Liberal.\r\n\r\nIt was the wheat that helped to keep Clark where he was on the outpost of\r\nLiberalism.  When his old leader became enswathed with election bandages,\r\nClark looked out upon the landscapes of the wheat, not so long ago the\r\nlimitless pasture of the free-trade buffaloes, and felt again the vision\r\nof the life that is Liberal but is sometimes called another name.\r\n\r\nAlberta was leaping to a great life.  Almost in the middle of it north\r\nand south is the town of Red Deer.  All about it were the settlements of\r\n\"nationals\" emancipated from bondage in Europe.  What was the use, quoth\r\nClark, of bringing such people to a country of free homestead land, of\r\nalleged free institutions and making them the slaves, first of political\r\nmachines, second of protected interests in the East?  If enslaved people\r\nwere to become free in a new land why should the wheat and the oats and\r\nthe cattle which they raised not be made free to move for a market as\r\nnaturally as the wind blows across the borders?\r\n\r\nThis may not have been the precise order in which such ideas generated in\r\nthe mind of Michael Clark; but it is the way those ideas confronting such\r\na man strike a contemporary.  I have lived in the land where Clark lives,\r\nthough not at Red Deer, and remember well the burning desire of twenty\r\nyears ago in that far northwest for economic emancipation.  Then at any\r\nmeeting, no matter what, any little dinner to a citizen no matter whom,\r\nmen rose to talk about the need of conquering the isolation of the\r\ncountry.  They remembered the tyranny of the old Trading Company into\r\nHudson's Bay.  They clamoured for more people, more farms, more towns,\r\nmore railways, more life--from the East.  And when it came they said the\r\nEast was a tyrant, an economic monster to bleed them white.  Clark, as\r\none remembers him best, has not been so much a foe to the East as he has\r\nwanted to be a friend to the South.\r\n\r\nBut a new oligarchy was arising on the great prairies.  As official\r\nliberalism got its grip on the three Provinces and became itself a\r\ntyrant, while unofficial Toryism in league with the big railways got a\r\nstranglehold on British Columbia, and when even \"Honest\" Frank Oliver\r\nceased to be an independent Liberal and became a red-taped Minister of\r\nthe Interior, Clark the Free Trader in Parliament found himself striking\r\nhands with a sect mainly of Liberal Radicals first called Grain Growers,\r\nnext Agrarians, and by some the very devil.  With official Liberalism as\r\nexpressed by Scott, Sifton, Cross, Norris and Martin he had only\r\nsuperficial sympathy.  These men were more or less on masquerade.  The\r\nAgrarians were barefaced, one-faced Radicals who would open the borders,\r\nand abolish the customs houses, and set up a sort of Western political\r\nautonomy whose root idea was that trade should be as free as\r\ngrasshoppers.  These people were not raising Old Flag wheat.\r\n\r\nHow far Clark fell in line with all the doctrines of the United Grain\r\nGrowers, I do not know.  But one thing clear about this insurgent is that\r\nhe has always stood four-square for the British connection--and for all\r\nthat it means to Canada.  Clark is a Britisher.  He still has his English\r\naccent.  You would spot him at once as a transplanted Englishman.  He is\r\nprouder of being a Briton in Canada than he ever would have been in\r\nEngland.  Clark never forgot--Manchester and Cobden.  He stood among the\r\nwheat and saw the Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen the War came and his adopted Province of Alberta for a long while\r\nheld the lead in enlistments for war, no man was happier in the grim\r\noutlook than the member for Red Deer.  The War to him was a great\r\nemergence of Liberalism the world over when Peace should bring Free\r\nHumanity, Free wheat, Free trade.  Why not?  His son went to the war--and\r\nhe lost him.  His speech on the Military Service Act was in many respects\r\nthe best of all in that debate, not in rhetoric, but in logical virility.\r\nIt was a howitzer broadside, slow, deliberate, but every shot a hit.  His\r\nold leader had already declined a belated offer of Coalition and was now\r\nopposing conscription and arguing for amendment by Referendum.  In all\r\nhis life he never got from a political foe such a searchlight on his soul\r\nas his once devoted follower gave him in this speech.\r\n\r\nLaurier had previously executed the Nationalist dodge of taking refuge\r\nbehind the Militia Act, asserting that it was right to enforce that Act\r\ncalling out the Militia for the defence of Canada; to which Clark replied:\r\n\r\n\"England is fighting this war wherever she sees the turban of a Turk or\r\nthe helmet of a Teuton.  She is fighting it in Egypt, Mesopotamia, in\r\nMacedonia, in Belgium--most of all in France. . . .  America, whose\r\nindependence had been fought in a struggle of blood for sound fiscal\r\nideas was now immortalizing her reunion with Britain, her old\r\nenemy. . . .  If organized labour was opposed to conscription, so much\r\nthe worse for labour, whose own trades unions were a form of\r\nconscription; in England he had never named either lord or labour with a\r\ncapital L. . . .  Canada should be in the war to her last man and her\r\nlast dollar. . . .  As to the referendum amendment, it was fathered by\r\nthe man who down to his attitude on this question had gone into history\r\nas the greatest of all Canadians, but who had applauded Pugsley when he\r\nargued against extending the life of this Parliament, and who in the\r\nmatter of sending men to fight, in organizing the whole nation for war,\r\nin conserving national unity, and in making an election a smaller matter\r\nthan the honour of a nation was opposed to the Government.  If the\r\namendment should carry, and the Referendum show a majority against the\r\nGovernment measure by omitting the soldier vote and piling up the vote\r\nfrom the Province which had given birth to the Referendum, then when the\r\nauthor of that measure should be returned to power on a no-conscription\r\nissue what chance was there for Canada to win her part of the war with\r\nthe lion Laurier and the lamb Oliver lying down together--and a little\r\nchild--Macdonald from Pictou--leading them?\"\r\n\r\nNot as a climax, but as a mere personal note midway in his speech, he had\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I have a little toddling grandson on my farm out West to-day whose\r\nfather was killed with a gunshot wound in his neck two weeks ago.  I say\r\nto you, sir, on my soul and conscience I support this Bill, because I\r\nbelieve it to be a part of the necessary machinery which can save that\r\nlittle fellow, born a Canadian, and thousands of others like him from\r\never going through what his father and his uncles have gone through.\"\r\n\r\nParliamentary debate has risen to much higher levels of oratory, but\r\nseldom to such a height of accusing vindication and personal affection\r\nfor the accused from whom an insurgent is driven to sever his allegiance.\r\nClark can always make some sort of big human speech with a natural knack\r\nof getting at the vitals of a subject in simple, dignified language and a\r\nsearching logic--once you admit his major premiss.  That one speech flung\r\ninto bold relief, almost as the No Man's Land under a flare of a great\r\nbarrage, the issues between men who for so many years had been political\r\nconfederates.\r\n\r\nA couple of years later I again met Clark when he was speaking guest at\r\nan Empire Club luncheon.  His topic was--the Empire.  His brand of\r\npolitical ideas was vastly different from those of the average man in his\r\naudience, and he knew it.  The Club had invited him, because he was\r\nMichael Clark.  He said not a word about trade.  He uttered no\r\npropaganda.  He talked simply and strongly about the race that had made\r\nthe Empire which to him was a commonwealth of neither trade nor conquest\r\nbut of liberating ideas.\r\n\r\nI don't think that any of the Chamberlain-Foster school could have\r\nuttered quite so broad and noble a tribute to the inner vitality of the\r\nBritish League of Nations.  And not even Mr. Rowell could have surpassed\r\nit for breadth of view on that subject, Clark looked at the Empire from\r\nwithin outwards.  He saw in it the expression of a great race of people\r\nworking the leaven upon other races; a mighty confederacy of free nations.\r\n\r\nRed Michael has been a great informing Liberal, and a big illuminating\r\nCanadian.  Whether grandly right or magnificently wrong, he is never\r\nuninteresting; a man who could come off a stack of wheat, wash himself up\r\nbare-armed, and in Sunday clothes but seldom well-dressed and never\r\ngroomed, step on to a platform over in the schoolhouse or the town hall\r\nand make a great speech to men who believe in the simplicity of a big\r\nmind that thinks hard on the welfare of the majority.  John Bright would\r\nhave loved such a man.  Even John Macdonald might have loved him.  And\r\nthe one regret among those who value the power of a big free nature in a\r\nnation is, that owing to some fatalistic streak in his genius, Michael\r\nClark has not risen to the inspiring height from which the country might\r\nget the best that he has to give.  Never cured of his insurgency in\r\nParliament, he has become an uncompromising conformist to one big and\r\nbigoted idea that universal Free-Trade is the need of the world, and\r\nespecially of Canada.  He persists in the delusion that what has been\r\ngood for Britain must be good for Canada; not only is Canada at war when\r\nBritain fights, but when Britain has no tariff Canada must have free\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nAll which is freely forgiven this stalwart on account of his challenge to\r\nthe group who took his Free Trade luggage and attempted to label it\r\nNational Progressive.  The Free Trader who could watch that caravan of\r\nadventurers going down the trail and stoutly tell them all to keep on\r\ngoing to the devil, deserves well of his country.  Michael Clark's\r\nadvocacy of Progressivism might have got him the promise of a Cabinet\r\nposition.  His rejection of it is the proof that the free-man who\r\nbelieves in great parties can never be bound by a class-conscious group.\r\n\"Better a dinner of herbs . . . .\"  Michael Clark, whether M.P. or not,\r\nis free to consider himself if need be a party of one man--without a\r\nplatform, but not devoid of a cause.\r\n\r\nWhatever Michael Clark knows about the benefits of Free Trade and its\r\neffect upon the exchanges, he knows peculiarly well the danger of\r\nunrestricted reciprocity in sentiment between Canada and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPHINX FROM SASKATCHEWAN\r\n\r\nHON. J. A. CALDER\r\n\r\nThe Hon. J. A. Calder has never seen the Sphinx.  But he has a looking\r\nglass.  He has never been in Egypt.  But he has lived a long while in\r\nSaskatchewan.  A man who can continue to know as much as he knows about\r\nthe confessional side of government, and who can say so little, has\r\nsome claim to be considered--Canada's political Sphinx.\r\n\r\nSuch a reputation is sometimes enviable.  The average public man\r\nbabbles.  Often he talks to conceal thought or as a substitute for\r\naction.  The mental energy needed to turn end for end what some of\r\nthese garrulous people say, in order to decipher just what they mean,\r\nis usually more than the wisdom is worth.  Calder spares us.  He tells\r\nus nothing.  His silence may be golden, or it may be just a habit; but\r\nfrom the known character of Calder it is never the omniscience of\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nA Sphinx in action may sometimes give himself away.  It is not usual\r\nfor a Sphinx to do anything except to conceal the riddle.  Calder has\r\nall his life been a busy man.  He is still in middle age.  All but\r\nfourteen years of his life up till 1917 he spent in the West, most of\r\nit in the part now known as Saskatchewan.  Ten years ago he was\r\nfurtively discussed as successor to Laurier.  He is now a\r\nUnionist-Liberal.  To give him work in the administration commensurate\r\nwith his ability--or somewhere near it--a new department was created in\r\nImmigration.  Now he is slated for the Senate!\r\n\r\nLittle was heard about Calder's department.  He had a publicity bureau\r\nwhich did not spend vast amounts of money on diffusing information.\r\nThe department is said to contain a moving picture section, some of\r\nwhose films probably creep into Canadian movie houses.  But nobody ever\r\nsaw a picture of J. A. Calder on a screen.  He had a Canadian novelist\r\nas chief of publicity.  That novelist might have yearned for the chance\r\nto immortalize his chief in a story, but so long as he is in the pay of\r\nMr. Calder's department he will continue to yearn.  And not even he has\r\nbeen given to understand why when a reconstructed Liberal like Mr.\r\nRowell left the Cabinet at the appointment of Premier Meighen, the\r\nMinister of Immigration stayed on.  One might surmise that the man who,\r\na decade ago, looked to some people like an Elisha to Laurier, would\r\nrun again in Moosejaw as a National Liberal Conservative with the\r\nexpectation of re-entering the Cabinet, probably as Minister of the\r\nInterior.  But he was suddenly and humdrumly designated for the Senate.\r\n\r\nApparently the Sphinx is not a great deal concerned over the fact that\r\nhis action in the case would throw some light on the sort of government\r\nwe may expect, and the kind of man we are privileged to conjecture Mr.\r\nCalder to be.  He seems to take very little interest in what any one\r\nthinks about him.  He accompanied the Premier on his Western trip.  Now\r\nand then he made a speech.  He was heckled.  He was in the land of his\r\ncritics, where he was unofficially known as \"Jim\".  What did he mean by\r\nstaying in a Government which was supposed to have finished its work in\r\n1919?  Was he coming back as a Liberal?  Had he no longer any\r\nfellow-feeling for the farmers among whom he had lived for so long?\r\nThe Sphinx did not directly say.  He was publicly and conventionally\r\nendorsing the Premier, who was well able to speak for himself on behalf\r\nof the administration.\r\n\r\nCalder was headmaster of Moosejaw High School when he was twenty-three,\r\nin the year 1891.  He must have learned reticence then.  Up in\r\nEdmonton, a few years later one heard considerably of Goggin, the\r\nspeechmaking educationist of the prairie; rarely or never of Calder,\r\nwho about that time was Inspector of Schools for the Territories, not\r\nyet provinces.  The silent young inspector must have looked like the\r\nreincarnation of Socrates as he drove--sometimes a four-horse team on a\r\nbuckboard--through the sloughs of the Northwest.  No prairie doctor\r\nwith a radius of fifty miles, none but a pioneer missionary like\r\nMcDougall or Robertson, ever had so glorious a chance to study what the\r\nlife of a new country was going to be, as this inspector toiling\r\nhundreds of miles over a land, where, if he stopped at three\r\nschool-houses a week, he was doing a good average in bad weather.\r\n\r\nRegina had no party politics then.  All it had was the mounted police\r\nand a leg-boot legislature.  Every man was then a trailsman.  In\r\nCalder's time as Inspector, there were only 400 miles of railway north\r\nof the C.P.R. main line--the two branches to Prince Albert and to\r\nEdmonton.  It was only in the last year or two of this buckboard and\r\nbroncho inspectorate that there were even any Doukhobors in that part\r\nof the world to bring back the days of Adam and Eve.  He saw all the\r\n\"nationals\" beginning to arrive.  He could put his finger on a gaunt\r\nanemic map of the Territories and point out just where there was\r\nbeginning to be some nucleus of a foreign settlement.  He could talk a\r\nlittle Cree and he learned the jargon of several countries in Europe.\r\nHe saw the farmers arise, and railways begin, and little villages dot\r\nthe skyline, and here and there an elevator, when a box car was looked\r\nat by a trailsman as a small boy gapes at a circus parade.\r\n\r\nCalder lived in Regina when politics was born.  He shares with Frank\r\nOliver the memory of the day when Nicholas Flood Davin was the wonder\r\norator of the West, and when freight-carters from Winnipeg to Edmonton\r\nvia Saskatoon, which was then a temperance colony, carried demijohns of\r\nwhisky on traders' permits to make everybody at home ingloriously\r\ndrunk, including the mounted police.  He recalls the day when the first\r\nlieutenant-governor was inaugurated in Regina and what Frank Oliver\r\nsaid about it.  Four years he was Deputy Commissioner of Education for\r\nthe Territories up till the inauguration of two new Provinces when,\r\ntravelling on a thousand miles of new railway and over the old main\r\nline of the C.P.R., Laurier paid his first visit to the Great West and\r\ndiscovered as one of its greatest potentialities J. A. Calder, who\r\nunder Premier Scott became Provincial Treasurer and Commissioner of\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\nTo people outside Saskatchewan--even in Alberta, he was very little\r\nknown--Calder has always been a somewhat nebulous figure; to some\r\ncritics, a rather suspicious character; but always--clever.  Being a\r\nSphinx he never courted popularity and seldom got it.  Scott was\r\nbrilliant, popular and impulsive.  His chief executive in Education,\r\nRailways and Telephones and Premier _de facto_ during more than half of\r\nScott's term, was cold and calculating.  The West prefers warm-blooded\r\npoliticians.  Calder succeeded in spite of his manner, or his mask, or\r\nwhatever it may have been; and he did it by a penetrating knowledge of\r\nthe country, a superb capacity as administrator and a talent for\r\nkeeping out of trouble.  He was no man for prima donna scenes.  Even\r\nthe Education Department, a witch's cauldron of troubles over the\r\nSeparate School question in the new provinces, never entangled him in\r\ntheatricals.  He was unpopular with the Opposition as soon as the new\r\nGovernment began, because he was regarded as a Civil Service\r\ninterloper.  What business had a school inspector in politics, and in a\r\nCabinet?\r\n\r\nCalder demonstrated that best when he handed over the educational\r\ncauldron to Scott and became Minister of Railways and Telephones.  Here\r\nwas a department of utility administration in which he shone.  He had\r\ngreat political executive ability.  When Scott was absent more than\r\nhalf his time through illness, Calder was Premier.  There was no other\r\nman to choose.  The liquor problem was more his to handle than the\r\nPremier's.  Calder did not share the popular enthusiasm for\r\nGovernment-dispensed liquor.  He knew the weaknesses of officials and\r\nthe historic thirst of the prairie.  The Opposition constantly accused\r\nhim of being in league with the liquor men.  Calder made no denial or\r\naffirmation.  He was Mephisto enough to let people wonder whether he\r\nwas one thing or the opposite.\r\n\r\nA man who knew Calder twenty-two years ago gave, not long ago, some\r\nimpressions of the Minister in connections with the liquor\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\"About two weeks after Saskatchewan went dry,\" he said, \"I was spending\r\na night in one of the larger towns in the Province.  Among the other\r\nguests at the hotel was a member of the Government.  In the lobby an\r\ninteresting argument waged throughout the evening, the Minister of\r\ncourse, defending the action of the Government in closing the bars.\r\nAmong other things he told us about the relief work carried on by the\r\nDominion and Provincial Governments in certain districts where there\r\nhad been crop failures, in order that the destitute settlers might earn\r\nor borrow enough to keep themselves and their families through the\r\nwinter.  He emphasized one mistake the Government had made in not first\r\nclosing every bar in the districts affected, because there were many\r\ninstances where every dollar that had been earned or borrowed had been\r\nspent in the bars on the very day that it was received, by the men\r\nwhose families it was intended to save from freezing and starvation.\r\n\r\n\"I was telling this afterwards to one of the leading social reformers\r\nof Saskatchewan, and a smile played over his face as I was speaking.\r\nWhen I had finished he said:\r\n\r\n\"'He didn't tell you the whole story.  We recognized the necessity of\r\nclosing those bars before that relief work was started, and urged it so\r\nstrongly on the Government that they agreed to do it.  The\r\nOrders-in-Council were drawn up and ready to be signed when Calder, who\r\nhad been absent from the Province on business, returned and immediately\r\nit was all off.'\"\r\n\r\nCalder has a sister who is one of the leading social workers in Regina.\r\nShe has a profound regard for her talented brother Jim.\r\n\r\nThe liquor did more than even Separate Schools to disrupt Government\r\nforces in Saskatchewan.  Calder was no hypocrite to weep over the moral\r\nissues in prohibition.  He was not a profound governmentarian or a\r\nchampion of enforced morality.  A Government might own and operate\r\ntelephones, but not so well consciences.  The liquor administration\r\nturned out to be a mess in Saskatchewan, largely because the\r\nadministration did not unanimously believe in the thing that the\r\nmajority seemed to want.  Calder was no more to blame than anybody\r\nelse, except that he was highest in the Government when the Premier was\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe reformers said that Calder was pro-liquor in the administration.\r\nHe seemed to have no opinions about that--at least for publication.\r\nIdeals often run away with communities.  If he had only spouted a\r\nlittle now and then he would have given people a chance to bring\r\nsomething home to him, and himself a chance to get near the people.\r\nTwo or three scandals came up in departments over which he had control.\r\nCommissions were appointed to investigate; they always exonerated\r\nCalder.  Even in the search-light on liquor--as many as four, one after\r\nanother--no technical blame attached to the silent Minister.  Calder\r\nmay have had a contempt for either commissions or public opinion.  A\r\nSphinx is as a rule not much of a burning avenger of wrongs to the\r\ncommunity.  Besides Scott was continually running into emotional\r\ntrouble.  The Premier _de facto_ had the balance to keep.  He must work\r\nwhile other people talked.\r\n\r\nA German-born but thoroughly loyal detective engaged by the Borden\r\nGovernment to report upon seditious activities of the German element\r\nwho were so badly disgruntled over the Wartime Elections Act, repeated\r\nto the writer more than once with great vehemence that Mr. Calder had a\r\nspecial interest in the _Regina Leader_, which was used to get votes\r\nfor the Administration, particularly among the German element.\r\nGovernments had been known to own newspapers before Calder ever began.\r\n_The Leader_ was naturally a Government organ and may have needed pap.\r\nThis is a form of patronage hard to uproot.\r\n\r\nWhen Scott finally retired the chief administrator did not succeed him.\r\nMartin was picked, a safe, genial and popular man.  The Sphinx, it is\r\nsaid, might have had the post; but he preferred to stay behind the\r\nscenes.  Before that he had been much talked about as a possible\r\nsuccessor to Laurier--but with not much hope of succeeding.  There are\r\nprobably a number of reasons why Mr. Calder did not take the Provincial\r\nPremiership.  Dig them out of Calder if you may.  He has never\r\nexplained.  He leaves it to his commentators.\r\n\r\nWe are privileged therefore to conjecture that:\r\n\r\nMr. Calder was pretty well sick of Saskatchewan politics and was\r\nlooking hard in almost any direction for a good way out;\r\n\r\nMr. Calder could see far enough into the near future of prairie\r\npolitics to know that Liberalism was becoming a label for something\r\nelse; and he was not disposed to come out as an Agrarian Liberal;\r\n\r\nMr. Calder wanted a chance to begin politics all over again, because\r\nwith all his practical success he felt that he had travelled some wrong\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\nPossibly all of these had something to do with the case.  At the\r\nWinnipeg Liberal Convention in 1917 he was a coalition-conscription\r\nLiberal.  He worked against the Liberal machine that captured the\r\nConvention by a fluke for Laurier.  Before that he was known to believe\r\nin Union Government.  It was only common sense to make him one of the\r\nPrairie triumvirate--Calder, Sifton, Crerar, who carried the West into\r\nthe Union.  Cloudy as his career has been, for no reason that anyone\r\nspecially cared to name, he might in Ottawa be a big force for the\r\nGovernment.  He was a behind-the-scenes actor.  He knew something about\r\nthe art of winning elections and converting immigrants into voters.  He\r\nwas practical.  He would be needed in Ottawa--more than he could see\r\nany use for his talent in Saskatchewan with its farmer-dominated\r\nCabinets.\r\n\r\nAlberta has gone Agrarian.  All Saskatchewan needs is a change of\r\nlabel.  Some psychological morning Premier Martin will get up and rub\r\nout \"Liberal\" after his name, buy a big farm and set up as a National\r\nProgressive.  Provincial Legislatures are things to be captured.  The\r\nold parties shrewdly used them in the Ottawa game.  The new ones are\r\njust as apt.  Too long these Western elective bodies have been on the\r\nswitch.  It is time to shunt them, once more, on to the main line that\r\nleads to Ottawa--with a different company label on the cars.\r\n\r\nBy no exercise of the imagination can one behold Jim Calder becoming a\r\nGrain-Grower Progressive.  The thing is anomalous.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Sphinx he is credited by those also who know\r\nhim well in Regina with going to Ottawa purely as a patriotic duty.  He\r\nwanted some work to do for the whole country bigger than any he had\r\ndone in Regina.  The authority formerly quoted in this article had this\r\nto say about Calder in 1917 when Calder took office in Ottawa:\r\n\r\n\"About the time of the Winnipeg Convention I was talking with the same\r\nman whom I have already quoted, and we were discussing the enigma which\r\nCalder's character and public record seemed to present.  I knew that my\r\nfriend was not especially a friend of Calder's, so his words seemed to\r\ncarry greater weight.\r\n\r\n\"'There is no person in Canadian public life,' he said, 'who has been\r\ntrying more conscientiously and consistently to be good than Calder.  I\r\nwill not say that his motive may be higher than that of political\r\nexpediency; but he has been and is more scrupulously careful to do\r\nnothing that may reflect in any way upon his honour and integrity.  I\r\nbelieve that he has set before him the highest possible ideal of public\r\nservice and that he is doing everything he can to live up to it.'\"\r\n\r\nA prominent citizen of Regina who has seen a good deal of Calder, both\r\nin his home city and in Ottawa, has the same opinion; adding that\r\nCalder never bamboozles a deputation with suave words or false hopes;\r\nwhat the Cabinet thinks about any particular programme of a deputation\r\nhe already knows and suggests that a typed memo, which he will present,\r\nwill be as good as waiting days for a personal appeal.  In 1919 he\r\ninformed the writer that he proposed to enact much-needed reforms in\r\nimmigrating Canada, especially as to the quality of new-comers.\r\n\r\nWhy has Mr. Calder never made a big study of this absorbing question?\r\nWhen the Premier went to the Imperial Conference, with his mind pretty\r\nwell made up on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, why had he not in his\r\ngrip, to show the Conference, one common sense, powerful little book\r\nsigned by Hon. J. A. Calder, Minister of Immigration, giving a complete\r\nexposition of Japanese life in Canada?  When we are all talking about\r\nthe good _entente_ with the United States why can't we get from the\r\nImmigration Department in Ottawa a hand-book giving a complete picture\r\nof what Americans have done in the West?\r\n\r\nHowever, the Sphinx may have the best of reasons for not doing these\r\nsimple things.  But there is scarcely a Department of administration\r\nthat does not regard itself as a machine for winning elections as much\r\nas for serving the people who pay for it.  Apart from all he has not\r\ntold us, I have no doubt Mr. Calder is doing a big reforming work on\r\nimmigration in Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe Immigration Minister should be our leading sociologist.  He should\r\nbe able to diagnose communities.  He might easily begin upon Ottawa.\r\nWhat a study a cross section of the Smart Set would be, especially upon\r\nthe arrival of a new king at Rideau Hall!  There's nothing in other\r\ndemocracies quite like that.  Washington has a White House, but the\r\ninmate is merely an elected servant of the State.  Rideau Hall is an\r\nendowment, a gift of the gods.  The 30,000 people of greater and lesser\r\ndegree in Ottawa who normally or abnormally live by the Civil Service\r\nare profoundly affected by the arrival, sojourn and departure of the\r\nGovernor-General.  They are vitally influenced and entertained by the\r\nParliamentary restaurant, even without the bar.  The social show\r\nprovided by Ministers' and members' wives and their visiting friends is\r\nitself a subtle study in the art of getting on in the new world, which\r\nis at the root of all immigration.  Bridge for money and dining out\r\nwith your friend's wife are within the reach of any ambitious\r\nimmigrant.  The Smart Set in Ottawa is an exotic colony all by itself.\r\nMontreal and Toronto and Winnipeg can merely copy it.  Some of the\r\nfarmers have their eye on the Set; no, not to abolish it.  Women must\r\nhave their share in the Government.  Petticoats and politics are\r\naffinities.  Farmers are no more necessarily immune from what is said\r\nto have corrupted the Roman Empire than Tories or Grits.  Farmers in\r\nfact, as Mr. Calder knows, are not the hope of the world; neither are\r\nlawyers nor manufacturers.\r\n\r\nSuppose we ask the Sphinx about this.  Listen in imagination to this\r\nonce Liberal, as with an astounding burst of candour he says:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, your description of my make-up may be as right or as\r\nfoolish as anybody feels disposed to think.  None of it bothers me.\r\nWhat does bother me is the law of compensation.  Agree with me that the\r\nmanufacturer had his drastic innings with Canadian governments; that\r\ntariffs and protected industries are the result; that lawyers--yes, I'm\r\na lawyer--have had a big day in our affairs because they had the talent\r\nfor schemes and speeches.  Admit that and conclude--that the very human\r\nfarmer thinks his turn is coming, and rather soon.  But--somebody who\r\nwas never educated as a Tory has got to help the\r\nNational-Liberal-Conservative Government to get an even chance to\r\nadminister this nation after the upheavals of war.  Somebody who moves\r\nsilently while others are talking their tongues loose may be needed to\r\nmanipulate----\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Sphinx could complete his statement of the case he was\r\npolitely asked if he would care to inter his talents in the Canadian\r\nSenate, and he suavely answered that such a thing might be a good way\r\nto solve the conundrum, even though it would make a thoroughly stupid\r\nlast act in the play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRUE VOICE OF LABOUR\r\n\r\nMR. TOM MOORE\r\n\r\nMany years ago an Irish poet visiting Canada and voyaging down the\r\nOttawa wrote a poem of which may people recall only the lines--\r\n\r\n  \"Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,\r\n  The rapids are near, the daylight's past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tom Moore about whom this article is sketched is not a poet.  He\r\nis, in fact, one of the prosiest public men in Canada.  But we may\r\nleave it to any of those who have known him during the past three years\r\nwhen he has been President of the Trades and Labour Congress, if many\r\nand many a time he has not felt some such sentiment as--\r\n\r\n  \"Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,\r\n  The rapids are near, the daylight's past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Charles Draper first became Secretary of that Congress he has\r\nnever known a period when so much was expected of a President by way of\r\nlimitless patience, statesmanship and self-control as has been shown by\r\nTom Moore.  The rapids were always close to this man, and there were\r\nrocks under the rapids.  It took steady piloting by the captain to keep\r\nthe crew of the labour ship from getting holes in her bottom and going\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSo far as one has been able to follow the career of Moore at the head\r\nof the Congress, and as reported in the public press, he stands now and\r\nalways for adherence to the principle of Union in evolution.  He\r\nbelieves in labour getting ahead; but not by the method of upturning\r\neverything that is established just to see what kinds of crawling\r\nthings there may be underneath.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that Canada is not primarily an industrial so much as\r\nan agricultural country, it is startling to remember that two years ago\r\nit was the home of the only organized attempt ever made in America on a\r\nscale of efficiency to establish something closely resembling a Soviet\r\ngovernment.  The big Winnipeg Strike was a lurid menace to the\r\nsolidarity of labour in Canada.  West of Winnipeg, once the Red River\r\nSoviet had been set up, there was a chain of inflammable centres to\r\nlink up with the revolution.  Calgary was the scene of one convention\r\nwhich had sent a cable of sympathy to Moscow.  British Columbia was\r\nfull of seething susceptible elements, regarded by some of the Reds\r\nacross the border as the real centre rather than Winnipeg, of the One\r\nBig Union idea.  The mines of Alberta were dominated by swaggering\r\nforeigners who owed no allegiance to the British or any other flag\r\nexcept the Red emblem.  Long ago under the influence of the clergy and\r\nthe Archbishop of Montreal, Quebec had created a Canadian Labour\r\nmovement intended to cut Canadian labour away from the American\r\nFederation.  This was a phase of the Nationalism that had its\r\nheadquarters in Quebec, but had spread in various strange guises to\r\nother parts of the country, when none of the clergy or intellectuals\r\nbehind the movement dreamed that the One Big Union insurgent against\r\nthe A.F.L. would be the most theatrical result.  Once get the O.B.U.\r\nidea rampant in Quebec with its scores of big industries and its\r\nthousands of poorly educated workers, and the Red movement was due to\r\nspread faster than the United Farmers' programme had ever done.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of the Red programme Ontario, and especially\r\nindustrial Toronto, was regarded as the buffer state.  But if the\r\nSoviet had succeeded in Winnipeg and further West, then the whole\r\nweight of that success marching upon Ontario, with Quebec bringing up\r\nthe eastern end, would form a sort of nutcracker device from which\r\nOntario would have had a hard time to escape.\r\n\r\nThis was the dazzling formula propounded at a time when every nation in\r\nthe world was in a state of ferment, and when the vast loose-jointed\r\nnation known as Canada was in a condition of instability unknown since\r\nit became a Confederation.  The apostles of the Red programme had all\r\nthe advantages of being able to sling the paint on to the canvas of the\r\nfuture without caring overmuch about the drawing.  Men in large numbers\r\neverywhere seemed ready to grasp at and embrace the unusual.  People\r\nwho for years had been ground down by high prices for the commonest\r\nnecessities, considered seriously the question of the \"salariat\"\r\njoining forces with organizing labour under a banner that might be red.\r\nCivilization, physically shattered by the war and hysterically\r\nstampeded by the doctrine of self-determination of peoples--a high form\r\nof Bolshevism--stood ready to inquire whether the theories being tried\r\nin Russia were not, after all, right, no matter what butchery might be\r\nperpetrated in working them out.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary ideas were everywhere.\r\n\r\nEverything prepared the public mind.\r\n\r\nA barrage of propaganda had been set up--and kept up.\r\n\r\nLegitimate Trades Unionism itself in Britain had subscribed to The Aims\r\nof Labour put forth by Arthur Henderson, who foreshadowed barricades\r\nand bayonets in London streets if the proletariat did not get their\r\n\"rights\".\r\n\r\nCanada did not surely escape.  We had the Winnipeg flare-up, which was\r\nwatched by legitimate labour across the border.  The A.F.L. was\r\nchallenged for authority in this country.  It came to the peculiar\r\npass, that in order to maintain the solidarity of Canada as constituted\r\nby Government under the Old Flag, the legitimate leaders of labour had\r\nto fall back upon the one continental organization which makes\r\nbrotherhoods, not across the seas, nor so much across Canada, but\r\nacross the border.\r\n\r\nIt was Ontario's opportunity; the steady old Province of some bigotry,\r\ngreat industry, many labour unions, and more or less fixed ideas\r\nregarding the function of Government.  The office of Tom Moore is in\r\nOttawa.  There the President of the Trades and Labour Congress is in\r\nclose touch with the Labour Department, with the _Labour Gazette_, with\r\nthe Government in Council.  We shall never know just how much of the\r\nsteady conservatism of Moore at the first Congress following the\r\nWinnipeg strike, as well as at other Congresses later, was developed\r\nand held steady by association with Government.\r\n\r\nBut whether or no, even though it was nothing but loyalty to the\r\nestablished brotherhoods of the A.F.L. or a deeper loyalty to his own\r\nideas of the case, the rock-steady influence of Tom Moore at the\r\nconventions was the one biggest hope of the indirect action element\r\nwinning out.  He was not opposed to Socialism.  He has to work with\r\nSocialists--of many sorts.  The whole basic idea of the Federation of\r\nLabour is a degree of Socialism.  But it was the Marxian brand of\r\nSocialism born in Germany and transplanted to Russia to which Moore was\r\nopposed.  He saw no field for this in Canada.  He believed that Canada\r\nhad a right to freedom of action.  At least if it came to a choice\r\nbetween authority from the Gompers organization in the United States,\r\nand the Lenine tyranny in Russia, the course was clear.  Time and time\r\nagain he was bombarded and machine-gunned by the Red elements in\r\nCongress and Convention.  As often he solidly stood his ground, based\r\nupon the older idea of labour getting its rights through negotiation\r\nand later through the ballot.\r\n\r\n  \"Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,\r\n  The rapids are near----\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the daylight was not yet past for this Tom Moore.  He could see\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen Moore,\" says a close observer of him for two years, \"faced\r\nby labour opponents in a number of Western cities.  In all the howling\r\nhe has never lost his temper or his dignity.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been so much easier for this man to lose his temper,\r\nexcept that he knew it would be harder at the end when he had to face\r\nhis own steady rank and file accusing him of poor chieftainship.  It\r\nwould have been so much easier to compromise with the preachers of\r\nglittering formulae, except that in the settling up he would have to\r\njustify himself to those who suspected him of defection.\r\n\r\nMoore stuck to the commonplace business of wages and hours and\r\nagreements.  He had no head for the poetry of Utopias.  He knew, as he\r\nknows, that wages are the chief item of cost in all commodities, and\r\nthat no matter what form of capitalism you choose, whether embodied in\r\na Soviet or in a close corporation of dividends, wages of labour must\r\nbe paid.  He knows that prices of living and of labour are almost\r\nconvertible.  Amid all the howling and paeaning for a better day, for\r\nthe new life, for the heaven upon earth, for the glorification of the\r\nproletariat, he could stand hard and fast by the common necessity of\r\nsticking to an agreement and as fast as possible bettering conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have heard independent observers say that the Reds have always shown\r\na grasp of the new life, while the Trades Union men were crawling along\r\nwith the uninspired programme of wages and hours; that the Reds were\r\nthe sacrificing idealists and the Unionists the selfish Tories who\r\nwanted nothing more than to slowly improve their condition.  Well, the\r\nlogic of events seems to show that in the long run the Moores have the\r\ngospel.  One scarcely cares to think what might have happened in\r\nCanadian industry and common living had Tom Moore given way to the Reds\r\nwho came at him from almost every quarter.\r\n\r\nAt the 1920 Congress Moore had the old-fashioned courage to ask the new\r\nPremier of Canada, Arthur Meighen, to address the delegates.  Of all\r\nmen, the man who prosecuted the leaders of the Winnipeg Strike was the\r\nlast to say anything to organized labour about milleniums or about\r\nanything more Utopian than a common agreement between labour and\r\ncapital for the good of all.  Moore had no fear.  He believed that he\r\nwas right.  Had he invited Mackenzie King he would have got a speech\r\nwith more in it about the philosophy of Industry and Humanity, and\r\nperhaps more to the point in the practical study of the labour\r\nquestion.  By inviting the Premier, Moore paid respect to government.\r\nEven Mr. Crerar might have made a more sympathetic speech.  But in the\r\nMoore philosophy there is no radical connection between Crerar and\r\nLabour.  In the organization of the Drury coalition between Labour and\r\nthe Farm he can see one way of getting the rights of each incorporated\r\ninto legislation.\r\n\r\nBut the Government is the final thing.  Statesmanship is bigger than\r\nprogrammes painted on the clouds.  There's a vast deal to be done yet\r\nin this country for the enfranchisement of labour in industry as it is\r\nfranchised in government.  There are pig-headed Tories of industry who\r\nwill have to illustrate tombstones before some of the old spirit of\r\nrepression of labour will die out in the nation.  But the die-hards are\r\nfewer every year.  Some wages had to come down to get everything else\r\ndown.  But we believe also, as Moore probably does, that wages which\r\nare the chief item of cost in all commodities ought to be as high as\r\nproduction will stand and pay reasonable profits on investment; that\r\ncollective bargaining is sound as applied to individual industries, but\r\na form of bigoted tyranny when extended to the whole group or to the\r\nsympathetic strike; and that the slogan, \"Union is Strength\", does not\r\nmean levelling efficiency to the lowest common denominator.\r\n\r\nThe day may come in the recorded minutes of Trades and Labour\r\nCongresses in Canada when a man of broader and more constructive vision\r\nmay be needed to build the brotherhood out into labour statesmanship.\r\nBut for the past few years, and for the few to come, Canadian labour\r\nand common weal may well arise to thank Tom Moore, who, when the rapids\r\nwere near and the rocks were under the rapids, kept his craft rowing\r\ninto safe water.  Tom Moore of Ireland was a poet.  Tom Moore of Canada\r\nis not.  The play on the names is only an accident.  The parallel\r\nholds.  May we never again need such a man in this country to be sure\r\nthat labour does not run us all on the rocks under the Red rapids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN WITHOUT A PUBLIC\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM MACKENZIE\r\n\r\nA few years ago, before Stefansson reported on the blond Eskimos, the\r\nfirst Eskimo movie ever taken was shown in Toronto to a small audience\r\nwho waited an hour for the film, which did not begin until a thick,\r\ngrizzly man with shrewish, penetrating eyes came in with his party.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Mackenzie, late as usual,\" whispered one.  \"He never\r\narrives on time at a public function, often sleeps at a play, and\r\nsometimes when his family invite musicians to his home he plays bridge\r\nin a distant room so as not to hear the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" nudged the other; \"but Sir William, you see, owns this film.\r\nIt was taken by his own exploration party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Then the last scene will probably be Eskimos laying railway ties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no.  Digging up mineral deposits.  Iron--Sh!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful film full of epical energy and primitive beauty;\r\npicturing one of the few kinds of people in Canada that Mackenzie had\r\nnever been able to link up to civilization.  The room was hung with\r\ncostumes, curios and weapons of these folk, all of which were\r\nafterwards presented to the Royal Ontario Museum by Sir William, who\r\nwas never enormously interested in ethnology.  And that exploration of\r\nthe far North was the last act in the complicated drama of William\r\nMackenzie's great discoveries in Canada.\r\n\r\nA study of Mackenzie is useful under the head:\r\n\r\n    WHAT DID YOU--NOT--DO TO WIN THE WAR?\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was appointed in 1915 on an \"Economic Commission\" which seems to\r\nhave practised a rigid economy on what it did for the country, because\r\nit was never heard of again.  However, it was No. 1A of the 46 war-time\r\ncommissions, and because Mackenzie was a member it should have a\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nThere is one man in Germany something like William Mackenzie, who makes\r\nmoney almost by magic out of utilities and buys up concerns in other\r\ncountries with money which he made in his own.  His name is Hugo\r\nStinnes.  Mackenzie is a bigger man and a higher type than Stinnes; but\r\neach man regards his country as a commercial asset to be developed;\r\neach is a wizard of a species of applied finance.  For years Mackenzie\r\nwas of speculative interest in Canada to people who had never even seen\r\nhis photograph.  He was the man who had a second headquarters in Ottawa\r\nand a branch office in every provincial legislature except Prince\r\nEdward Island.  We almost had Provincial Premiers lullabying to their\r\nCabinets:\r\n\r\n  \"Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye,\r\n  The Black Douglas shall not get ye.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMackenzie seemed to arise about twenty-five years ago from some magic\r\nmountain and to stride down upon the plains with the momentum of a Goth\r\narmy.  He was a contractor who became for ten years a demigod.\r\nSometimes before the war when people saw him on the street they paused\r\nto watch him walking as though a black bear had suddenly wandered down\r\nfrom Muskoka.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!  Mackenzie's back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that William Mackenzie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never see him before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I never saw him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take a good look.  He's just going to lunch.  That man brought\r\nback sixty million dollars this time from Threadneedle Street.  A gang\r\nof reporters met him at Montreal to get the good news---more money for\r\nCanada.  Great game!  He got forty millions a year ago or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's that benign man with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a Provincial Premier.  His province wants more railways and the\r\nGovernment has to guarantee more bonds----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then he sells bonds with Provinces for security?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the big idea.  Why, what's wrong with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess it's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is.  Railways can't be built out of earnings of lines\r\nbuilt last year.  Traffic's too thin; has to be developed.  Mackenzie's\r\nbuilding lines for a real population Canada, my boy, is a terrific\r\ncountry to railroad.  The C.P.R. got land and cash grants.  Mackenzie\r\ntakes Government-guaranteed bonds.  The whole country is on the same\r\nroad.  We import people on to homestead land and we have to borrow\r\nmoney to set the people up so that they'll become real Canadians----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, especially at election time.  But tell me--who finally owns these\r\nrailroads?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got me.  Nobody has figured that out yet.  Everything is\r\ntoo new.  All I know is that Governments are behind Mackenzie, and the\r\npeople elect the Governments, and the people want the roads, and if\r\nthey don't get 'em the Government probably goes out.  Anyhow I take off\r\nmy hat to Sir William Mackenzie as a great man.\"\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of Canada used to think that Mackenzie was a great man.\r\nThe more he borrowed in England on Government-guaranteed bonds, and the\r\nmore he invested in Mexico and South America, and the greater number of\r\nstreet railways, power plants, transmission lines, ore mountains, new\r\ntowns, smelters, docks, ships, whale fisheries, coal mines and land\r\ncompanies that he and his able partner Mann were able to octopize, the\r\ngreater the country thought both these men were--and especially\r\nMackenzie.\r\n\r\nToronto Board of Trade once gave a dinner to these men to celebrate the\r\nfact that by the building of the new line to Sudbury at a cost of about\r\nfifteen millions, Toronto was at last actually located on a Mackenzie\r\nroad and had a right to be made the headquarters of the system.  A deer\r\nin some places could have jumped from that line to the new line of the\r\nC.P.R. built at the same time--and about the same cost.  There was no\r\nfarmer in Ottawa to prevent the C.P.R. from getting a charter to\r\ndouble-track this line.  It was the same year that Mackenzie\r\ninaugurated the Canadian Northern line of steamships, the two Royals,\r\nand for lack of tidewater was compelled to dock them at Montreal under\r\nthe shadow of the C.P.R., who of course did not join in the civic\r\nwelcome.  And in the same year people were talking--as they are now\r\nagain--about Toronto and Port Arthur becoming ocean ports.  The wonder\r\nwas that Mackenzie did not see to it.  But he was fairly busy, tying\r\nHalifax to Vancouver by the Yellowhead Pass, and giving Provincial\r\nCabinets new ideas about government.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt William Mackenzie had a mandate from this country to do\r\na great work--and he overdid it.  Bankers and other financiers agreed\r\nthat he had found new ways of investing creative money.  Scarcely a\r\nteacher of geography but admitted that Mackenzie was changing the map\r\nof this country so fast that a new one became necessary every three\r\nyears.  New towns sprang up at the rate of a mile a day of new railway\r\nbuilt by Mackenzie.  Every new town became a monument to this man's\r\nfaith in the future of Canada.  Even the old city of Montreal, preserve\r\nof the C.P.R., lent its mountain to Mackenzie for a tunnel and a \"Model\r\nCity\" on the hinter side.\r\n\r\nThere was always money to be had.  A map of Canada in Mackenzie's\r\nsatchel when he went to England to see money lenders seemed under his\r\ntalk as big as the whole British Empire.  It was not common Empire\r\npatriotism to refuse either the money or the guarantees for the bonds.\r\nThe whole of Canada backed Mackenzie's notes.  It was he, not Sir\r\nThomas White, who invented the principle of Victory Loans whereby the\r\nnation becomes your banker.  Between building a new line and operating\r\na line built last year, there was no system of accounting that could\r\naudit his books.  The centipede became so vast and complex that no\r\nbanker could begin to understand it.  Mackenzie never made the effort.\r\nHe was developing Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Saskatchewan valley was the one great trunk Eldorado, the greatest\r\ndiscovery of natural resources ever made in Canada.  The settlers in\r\nthat valley wanted more people, the people wanted the railways, the\r\nGovernment needed the voters, and Mackenzie wanted settlers, people,\r\nvoters, Government and all.  If a Government was obstreperous,\r\nMackenzie might lend a heavy hand to help turn it out at the next\r\nelection.  It was not proper for a Government to obstruct him.  He was\r\nthe over-man.\r\n\r\nIn no other nation has there ever been a man who could play such a\r\nprodigious and prodigal game with the resources of the whole country.\r\nMackenzie mobilized the nation before the war.  Millions of people in\r\nCanada used to regard him as a sort of magnified Daniel Drew--the\r\nfather of Wall Street and watered stock and corrupt-contract railways.\r\nBut Mackenzie was a broader man than Drew, with a much higher sense of\r\nhonour.  Drew admitted that he was a wonderful Methodist, that he had\r\nbeen a profiteer of the Civil War, and that he had starved a railway of\r\nrails so that it killed a large number of people in an accident.\r\nMackenzie was no Methodist; and he never was a profiteer from any\r\nemergency of the people.  He wanted Canada to prosper.  All his profits\r\nmust come from greater wealth in Canada, which he did much to produce.\r\n\r\nMackenzie had more faith in Canada than most of the politicians had.\r\nHe wanted a great Canada, chief Dominion in a great Empire, The best\r\nway to conserve a nation's wealth, he said once, is to develop its\r\nresources.  We never had such a developer.  He never was a born\r\nrailwayman, any more than he was a pure financier.  He was a colossal\r\nexploiter of national resources by means of borrowed money.  In the era\r\nbefore Mackenzie we had Clergue at the Soo.  Clergue was a pigmy\r\nforerunner of Mackenzie.  What Clergue did in Algoma the other man\r\naimed to do for the whole country, And he almost did it.\r\n\r\nAsked once why he gave so much leeway to men like Mackenzie and Mann,\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier is reported to have said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what other kind of men could you have to do such remarkable\r\nwork?\"\r\n\r\nBeaverbrook said at a dinner in Canada not long ago:\r\n\r\n\"I never was a William Mackenzie.  I created nothing as he did.\"\r\n\r\nThe debacle of Mackenzie railways was never contemplated by Mackenzie.\r\nHe did not even imagine that it was possible--except that he was\r\nprophetically troubled by the ambition of Laurier to create a third\r\ntranscontinental.  He had the right of way in this.  He and Mann had\r\ndeveloped the Canadian Northern out of a little stub line in Dauphin,\r\nManitoba.  The thing grew because it served the people, and the people\r\nlived in a fertile country that needed a road to market.  The whole\r\nbasic idea of the Mackenzie roads was to give more and more people a\r\nroad to market.  The original idea of the Grand Trunk Pacific and the\r\nNational Transcontinental was to rival the Canadian Pacific monument to\r\nJohn A. Macdonald by erecting a railway monument to Wilfrid Laurier.\r\n\r\nThe race of the railways just about broke the nation's neck.  It was\r\nnot all the fault of Mackenzie that the race ever began, or that it was\r\ncarried on to insanity.  He was a practical philosopher to perceive\r\nthat a Government is an elective corporation capable of manipulation in\r\nthe interest of an all-Canada enterprise needed and wanted by the\r\npeople.  He was a master cynic to surmise that when the future came to\r\nbalance the accounts, Father Time would be a very bewildered assignee.\r\n\r\nThe war was very ill advised.  Mackenzie had no use for war.  He never\r\ncould see in the predicament of a nation any chance to profit for\r\nhimself.  He wanted perpetual prosperity.  It never occurred to him,\r\nperhaps, that some day critics would arise to say that the country\r\ncalled Canada had done more for William Mackenzie than he had ever done\r\nfor the country; and that when the parent utility of the cycle which he\r\nhad helped to create was declared bankrupt, he had no rights in the\r\ncase whatever and never should have been paid a dollar of indemnity for\r\nthe common stock.\r\n\r\nBut as the country had submitted to Mackenzie's system of building\r\nrailways, so it was compelled to be content with the Royal Commission\r\nmethod of adjudicating what the builders should get out of the wreck.\r\n\r\nFinanciers and politicians and common citizens may wrangle till\r\ndoomsday about the ethics of this debacle.  They will never get anybody\r\nto understand it.  The thing is an economic outlaw like its author.\r\nMackenzie as a common storekeeper would have been sold for taxes.  As a\r\nrailway builder he staged the greatest pageant of industry ever known\r\nin Canada, and when the show went off the road because it was no longer\r\nable to pay its bills, took what he could salvage of the properties and\r\nleft other men to wrestle with the reconstruction.\r\n\r\nWe shall never have another Mackenzie.  Bigger men may arise.  More\r\nunusual characters may stalk out of obscurity into places of eminence\r\nand power.  But there never again can be an era like the Mackenzie\r\nepoch, because that kind of experience is suffered and enjoyed but once\r\nin a nation's lifetime.  He still has big interests, some of them\r\ngradually being taken over by governments and municipal corporations.\r\nBut he has shot his bolt, and it was a Jovian big one.  No doubt he is\r\nenormously rich.  That does not matter.  Canada no longer cares whether\r\nhe is rich or poor.  Once a demigod in our national ledgers, he is now\r\na grizzled relique of his former energy.  He used to be a despot feared\r\nby those who had to work under him, admired for his superhuman audacity\r\nand power to get what he wanted just because he knew why and when he\r\nwanted it, and capable of inspiring an almost insane loyalty to a\r\nman-made system that never was anything at all but an economic mirage.\r\nHe is now just William Mackenzie, more or less a citizen, now and then\r\ninterviewed laconically by a reporter who never can extract anything\r\nbut arid commonplaces from what he says to the public.\r\n\r\nBecause, to William Mackenzie there never was any real public.  What he\r\ncared about was the prosperous nation upon which he could build and\r\nbuild without limit till he died.  When the nation came to a crisis in\r\nthe war he did nothing to help it, except to let the Railway War Board\r\npool his lines for traffic and the Government commandeer his ships.\r\nThe man who years before had been regarded as the greatest doer in\r\nCanada, when the country and all Mackenzie's works along with it came\r\nto the great test, never so much as lifted a personal finger to help in\r\nthe work that had to be done.  Mackenzie had done his work in\r\nprosperity.  In the great predicament he had no function.  The nation\r\npaid him his ducats and let him go.\r\n\r\nThis, if we are concerned about the man value of Canada, is a tragedy.\r\nFor there was in William Mackenzie somehow, with all his ruthlessness\r\nand audacity and semi-piratical creed, the element of a kind of great\r\nman.  There is in his uncommon face the look of a man who with less\r\nexcess of one quality might have become a wonderful citizen.  Nature\r\nmade him vastly selfish on a scale big enough to devise a totally new\r\nscheme for over-capitalizing Canada.  She denied him the commoner human\r\nqualities that make a man a constructive citizen whether his country is\r\nin weal or woe.\r\n\r\nThe epic which Mackenzie and his partner achieved in this country\r\nout-bid in dimensions, variety and the use of practical imagination,\r\neven the work of Rhodes in South Africa.  It was a feat of economic and\r\nfinancial engineering which but for its peculiarly selfish energy and\r\nruthless characteristics, might have become a monumental contribution\r\nto the human welfare of Canada.  No man of common brain or conventional\r\nethics could have been the dynamic head of such a work.  For years,\r\ndecades, this astounding adventurer exercised his precarious despotism\r\nover the country that he might make its prosperity a factor in his own\r\nsuccess.  In gambling with its securities he hoped to multiply its\r\nwealth without diminishing its happiness.  The constructive imagination\r\nand tireless energy that he expended on his great cycle of utilities,\r\nhad it been spent by a poet would have produced epics and dramas.  But\r\nin all the things he did and the words he said, there is no record of\r\nany sentiment of sacrifice for the good of a nation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mackenzie had his day, while Governments rose and fell.  His\r\nday is done.  The public which he dazzled and outwardly despised has no\r\ncredulity left for any further hero-worship of such a man.  \"Well, what\r\ndoes Mr. Mackenzie want now?\" was the oft-repeated query of the\r\nbewildered Laurier to Mackenzie agents in Ottawa.  No Canadian Premier\r\nwill ever ask such a question again.  Ottawa has no further\r\npossibilities for William Mackenzie of any interest to the public.  The\r\nkind of prosperity created by such men as he is played out in Canada\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe forecast than Mackenzie and Flavelle might form a new two-man junta\r\nto operate National railways was too absurd even to merit denial.  Such\r\na partnership would merely revive the old Schoolman debate of the\r\nMiddle Ages--What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable\r\nobject?  The two mentalities are incompatible.  For twenty years the\r\nchief common ground between them was the Canadian Bank of Commerce, of\r\nwhich Sir Joseph is a director, who long ago discovered that the total\r\nassets of the bank were but a turbine in the Niagara of Mackenzie\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nAnd William Mackenzie who built the conspiracy of enormous interests\r\nwith which his name is identified, was never meant to be a railway\r\noperator at all.  One might as well expect Lloyd George to be a\r\nsuccessful manager of Sunlight Soap and of Lord Leverhulme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL BRAINSTORM\r\n\r\nLORD BEAVERBROOK\r\n\r\nLord Beaverbrook could stroll into an Arab camp and in five minutes be\r\npsychologically persona grata as the man who could make something out of\r\nalmost nothing.  He could learn the Arab language, adopt their customs,\r\ninterpret their ideas, transact their tribal business, and go away\r\nwithout an Arab to admit that the strange new chief--or whatever they\r\nmight call him--would ever learn to be a true Arab.\r\n\r\nThis man without a congenial country has an unlimited talent for adapting\r\nhimself to the necessities of time, place and opportunity.  He has little\r\nor no power to assimilate himself to the real life of the people.  He\r\ntrailed like a comet through the land of his birth and left it in a\r\nmirage of finance before Canada had made him a citizen.  He went to\r\nEngland where in a few months he had made himself intimate with public\r\naffairs; and in ten years, \"with all his honours thick upon him,\" he has\r\nnot yet become an Englishman.\r\n\r\nOnce only I met this extraordinary man, at close range, for a number of\r\nhours.  He was a most absorbing study; and he knew it.  There never was a\r\nmoment when Beaverbrook could not consciously estimate the effect of his\r\nactions upon some other man, or group of men.  As an actor he is not a\r\nmediocrity.\r\n\r\nA personal friend vividly describes meeting him at a small semi-private\r\ndinner in a Canadian city.  The ostensible occasion was a mere\r\ncomplimentary affair to his lordship.  The psychological objective\r\nwas--something else.  There began the conjecture.  What was it?\r\n\r\nIt must be inferred.  There are some men who study the effect of\r\nthemselves upon a group.  The group method of psychology is essentially\r\nBeaverbrookian.\r\n\r\nA number of speeches had been pre-arranged for this dinner on behalf of\r\nvarious interests.  At the close of the talks Beaverbrook was asked to\r\nrespond to a toast of his own health.  He did so in a perfectly amazing\r\nconfessional of a speech, saying things which he said he felt sure no\r\njournalist present would publish.  He was asked questions.  Each question\r\nmeant one more speech.  He made four in all, occupying much more than an\r\nhour of time in a most graphic and humanly interesting account of things\r\nthat had happened behind the curtain in British politics, shrewd\r\nestimates of the signs of the times, forecasts of coming events and vivid\r\ndelineations of great men whom he had intimately met in various parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn all this there was not a trace of embarrassment or of suspicion.  The\r\nlittle dynamo with the prodigious head and the baby mouth and the\r\nintense, deepset, restless eyes stood by his chair, and with knuckles on\r\nthe table much of the time, talked down into the flowers directly in\r\nfront of him.  He spoke sometimes in a husky, low voice, now and again in\r\na smothered shriek, again in a tragic whisper.  He was in a small\r\ngathering and he seemed to know that though the dingy, mysterious room\r\nwas somewhat high, he had no need to lift his voice to the shrill\r\nimpetuous discord that is said to characterize his speeches in Commons or\r\nLords.  He was carried away by some indefinable atmosphere.  What it was\r\nhe scarcely knew.  After the dinner he shook hands with people, delivered\r\nhimself of a number of snappy brusqueries, laughed a good bit and, almost\r\nthe last to leave the charmed precinct where he had unbosomed himself\r\namong \"congenial\" souls, he wandered out.\r\n\r\nNext day, lying poseurishly on a lounge in his room at the hotel, he said\r\nto a confidante who had been with him at the dinner:\r\n\r\n\"Bunting!\" (that is not the true name) \"Will you kindly repeat to me some\r\nof the things I seem to have said last evening.  I know I talked an\r\nunconscionably great deal.  What on earth did I say?\"\r\n\r\nAs it had been a perfectly abstemious occasion, one imagines that\r\nBeaverbrook at the dinner was sincere, though playing the actor, and that\r\nin his room he was both theatrical and insincere.\r\n\r\nThis man has a confusing, but in his own mind seldom confused, orbit of\r\nhis own.  He was a conundrum in Canada.  He is an enigma in England.\r\nThat he still considers himself a Canadian, because he was born here,\r\nfortuned here and voluntarily exiled from here after he had completely\r\nmystified a large number of people as to his working psychology, is\r\nproved by the fact that he continues to come back here.  He also\r\nprofesses to be manning the _Daily Express_ with Canadians.  He has been\r\nfor ten years the intimate of Bonar Law, also a distinguished Canadian of\r\nsorts.  And a few months ago there was a rumour, which no one remembers\r\nhim to have refuted, that he was a likely candidate for the\r\nGovernor-Generalship of Canada.  Of course if ever Rideau Hall should\r\ntake Beaverbrook for a tenant, it will be time to take refuge in a\r\nCanadian republic.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to think disagreeable things about Beaverbrook, because he is\r\nso enormously interesting, so pathologically unusual, and altogether so\r\nbrilliant and resourceful a phenomenon.  I have called him the Imperial\r\nbrainstorm.  A dozen other titles would fit him as well.  There are times\r\nwhen one almost imagines himself mingling an element of real liking for\r\nthe man with one's unfailing admiration of his remarkable ability.  But\r\nalways when you feel like that cordial handshake and talking to him with\r\nbrusque familiarity, there is the intuitive feeling that one of the two,\r\nperhaps both, might live to regret it.\r\n\r\nYou cannot absorb the atmosphere of such a man.  Whatever the sterling\r\nqualities of his character, the approximate miracles of his achievements,\r\nthe warlike strategy of his career, you judge him at last by that\r\nindefinable but inexorable law of common congeniality.  To live at close\r\nrange with Beaverbrook, to become part of his daily scheme of vibrations,\r\nto work either with, or for, or even over him as a regular part of one's\r\nprogramme would be to a normal man a penalty almost amounting to a crime.\r\n\r\nThough of course tastes differ, even in companions.  There are people who\r\nrather like hobnobbing with Beaverbrook.  Some are interested in his\r\nidiosyncrasies, as though he were a good subject for a novel.  Some enjoy\r\nthe sensation of playing moth to a social flame.  Others--perhaps--have a\r\ndeep respect for his money which, like Carnegie's, is supposed to be a\r\nperplexity to himself to know how to spend it that he may die poor.\r\n\r\nWell, the noble lord has his idioms.  Discussing the details of the\r\nlittle dinner already referred to a flippant but devoted critic said:\r\n\r\n\"I think he would enjoy speaking right in front of that huge fireplace.\r\nHe would consider it Napoleonic.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the social orbit of Beaverbrook, one may suspect that it is a\r\nrather exotic atmosphere in which the sense of true human equation is\r\nlost in a jumble.  A man who can entertain almost simultaneously, at his\r\ncountry home, financiers, politicians, authors, and actresses from his\r\nown theatre at Hammersmith, may be regarded as a shrewd social mergerist\r\nbut scarcely as a subtle entertainer of congenial souls.  As for the\r\ndiscomfort of knowing what to do with his money, Beaverbrook has never\r\ncomplained; during his latest visit to Canada he was offered and he\r\nrefused the purchase of two bankrupt newspapers each of which thought\r\nthat the acquisition of such a side line to the _Daily Express_ might\r\nenable him to do some of the good in this country which he failed to\r\nachieve while he lived here.\r\n\r\nEstimating this man by the superficial but rather subtle qualities by\r\nwhich he has achieved success, it seems a sort of irony to think what he\r\nmight have done and did not do for the country of his birth.  What did he\r\never do for Canada?  Before the war--nothing.  He made huge fortunes\r\nhere.  He created mergers here.  He started consolidated companies here\r\nthat in time fought their way into the appreciated valuations of the\r\nstock market.  He became Canada's greatest adventurer in creating a sort\r\nof \"wealth\" from the merging of small, sometimes decrepit, concerns under\r\na new name and new issues of stock; just as Mackenzie was our greatest\r\nadventurer in creating wealth from borrowed money.  Beaverbrook worked\r\nmainly with small groups to whom he left the task of raising most of the\r\ncapital.  Thus his personal gains came neither from the immediately\r\nincreased earnings of companies which he amalgamated, nor directly from\r\nthe pockets of the shareholders.  Beaverbrook never made a dollar by\r\ndefrauding a director or luring unsuspicious dollars out of the pockets\r\nof common people.  That species of tactics so often practised by men who\r\nare near criminals was quite beneath him.  The laboratory where he got\r\nhis results was the stock market, which of course has its own codes of\r\nethics and plays its own remorseless game of making or breaking men.\r\n\r\nHis career here had most of the elements of romance.  Son of a poor\r\nparson born in a cross-roads Ontario hamlet, brilliant but erratic\r\nstudent at Dalhousie University, down-at-the-heels insurance agent in\r\nHalifax, youthful merger of two small banks at a time when he was unable\r\nto pay for his own clothes--we have here symptoms of a career which might\r\nhave turned into a character of high value in Canadian politics, public\r\nservice or social reform.\r\n\r\nBut Nature thrives on migrations.  Even a man sometimes takes better root\r\nwhen he is transplanted.  The Beaverbrook that England has is a more\r\nunusual character than the Max Aitken that Canada lost.  Canada to be\r\nsure had lost enough brilliant men to other nations and imported enough\r\nable men from abroad.  It was time to produce and to keep our own.  There\r\nwas national work for them all to do.  Aitken came up in the boom time of\r\nCanada.  He fitted the time.  A nation's financial adversity was no\r\noccasion for him.  He followed the wake and profited by the experiences\r\nof builders of railways, industries, banks and provinces.  Every move\r\nforward of the country in commercial expansion was a nudge ahead for his\r\nchariot of fortune.  He was the most successful \"bull\" factor Canada ever\r\nhad.  But in all probability, were he to be flung into one of the\r\ndemoralized nations of democratized Europe he could make money even in\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nBefore he was thirty-five Max Aitken had become a multi-millionaire.  He\r\nworked much as clever but humbler men have invented formulae to beat\r\nbookmakers at the races.  Having done all this, at so early an age, what\r\nwas left?  Superficially we should have said--public life.  He had the\r\nmoney, the talent, the leisure.  Canada had the need.\r\n\r\nBut Max Aitken never so much as became a pound-keeper in Canada, not\r\nbecause he had not the opportunity, but because he had the shrewd sense\r\nto feel that the land where he had made \"his pile\" was not the land in\r\nwhich to serve his country.  To serve a nation means as a rule to deal\r\ndirectly with the public.  Max Aitken had never dealt with the public.\r\nNeither does he yet--except indirectly through a big daily newspaper of\r\nphenomenal circulation.  On his last visit to Canada he was invited to\r\npublic functions.  He consistently declined; not because he shunned\r\npopularity or hated the limelight, but because he would not have felt\r\ncomfortable.  In one of his speeches he pointed out that the securities\r\nwhich he put on the market years ago were all now listed as paying\r\nventures.  It was more comfortable to make that remark as a returned\r\ncelebrity than to have made it as a citizen.\r\n\r\nHis own story of why he went to England, and stayed there, is ingenuous.\r\nHe said that he went in order to do business; that he tried to talk\r\nbusiness; that the public men with whom he had conference insisted on\r\ntalking politics; that he succumbed and stayed, winning a seat in the\r\nCommons, and almost before an ordinary man could have said \"Jack\r\nRobinson\", he was hobnobbing with men the calibre of Bonar Law, Lloyd\r\nGeorge, Northcliffe.\r\n\r\nOnly fragmentary accounts of Beaverbrook's political history in England\r\nhave as a rule drifted over here.  To show what an amazing story it is,\r\nnothing can be better than to quote a curiously apt summary written for\r\ntwo Canadian periodicals by Arthur Baxter, who for some years now has\r\nbeen a sort of Boswell to Beaverbrook.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIn 1910 captured the seat for Ashton-under-Lyne.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 a vigorous and successful attack on Lloyd George concerning\r\nfinance matters in the House.\r\n\r\nFrom 1911 to 1914 he entered parliamentary intrigue and gradually his\r\nhome at Leatherhead became a Mecca for puzzled politicians.\r\n\r\nDuring this time somebody made him a Knight.\r\n\r\nThe Irish situation was more than threatening; the tariff issue was\r\ncausing bitterness; Austen Chamberlain with a minority following was\r\nfighting Walter Long to lead the Tories and on this troublesome sea Sir\r\nMax Aitken's barque bobbed up and down with the skipper's eyes keenly\r\nalert.  He saw the possibilities in Bonar Law.  When Chamberlain and Long\r\ncreated a deadlock, Beaverbrook advocated Bonar Law as leader of the Tory\r\nParty.  To make his voice heard more distinctly he purchased the _Daily\r\nExpress_ and backed his candidate with a powerful but (then) not very\r\nprofitable newspaper.  Law has the reputation for modesty, but his\r\nfellow-Canadian led him to the barrier, started him off and when he\r\nstopped running he found himself leader.\r\n\r\nFor some time it had seemed as if Asquith's Coalition Government would\r\nsurvive the war, but late in 1917 it was obvious that the old ship was\r\nleaking badly.  Carson was the first to propose scuttling the frigate.\r\nThe others argued that even a sinking ship was better than no ship at\r\nall, so the Irishman went overboard and sailed away on his own raft.\r\nBonar Law representing the good old Tory element kept on working the\r\npumps; Mr. Asquith kept on assuring the crew that all they needed was to\r\n\"wait and see\"; and Lloyd George was wondering whether he had better take\r\na hand at the pumps as well or throw both Asquith and Bonar Law into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a sail was sighted.  It was Max Aitken's barque that\r\n\"hopped aboard\" and took in the spectacle of his old Maritimian sweating\r\nat the pumps; and noticed with a critical eye the extremely able\r\nappearance of that able-bodied politician, Lloyd George.\r\n\r\nBeaverbrook thought the situation over--swiftly.  He saw that the genial\r\nMicawber on the Bridge could not be routed as long as Bonar Law and Lloyd\r\nGeorge stuck to him.  But even if they could be persuaded to heave the\r\nskipper overboard, could they sail the ship and keep the crew loyal as\r\nwell?\r\n\r\nHe decided that Carson had to be brought back to the fold, so jumping\r\ninto his little craft he scoured the political sea and returned shortly\r\nwith the uncrowned king of Ireland on board.\r\n\r\nBut Lloyd George, Bonar Law and Sir Edward Carson loved each other as\r\nmuch as three Prima Donnas.  They all agreed that Asquith was sailing to\r\ndisaster, but they weren't sure that they didn't prefer disaster under\r\nthe Old Chief to prolonged life in each other's company.\r\n\r\nBeaverbrook had seen a vision and he knew that Lloyd George was the only\r\nman in England capable of forming a ministry that would last six months.\r\nDay after day the Canadian stuck to his task and gradually the three men,\r\nall smarting from old political quarrels, agreed to send an ultimatum to\r\nthe skipper that they demanded a sailing committee under the leadership\r\nof \"Pincher\" Lloyd George.\r\n\r\nIn other words they demanded a War Cabinet with the Welshman as Chairman.\r\n\r\nFinally, in desperation, Lloyd George called for a mutiny.  Bonar Law\r\nsummoned all the Tory crew around him.  They went to the bridge and told\r\nthe Skipper that they were sorry to break the news to him, but it had\r\nbeen decided that, all things considered, he had better walk the plank.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith was dismayed, blustered, then resigned--defying the mutineer\r\nWelshman to do any better.  His Majesty called on Bonar Law to form a\r\ncabinet; the Canadian declined with thanks but mentioned the name of a\r\ncertain Welshman as a likely candidate for the job.  The Welshman was\r\nasked--and accepted.  Two days later his Cabinet was formed.  Carson took\r\nover the pumps; Bonar Law went up to the bridge and Lloyd George\r\ndelegated to himself the rank of Commander and Pilot of Britain's ship of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the story of Beaverbrook's tremendous contribution to winning\r\nthe war.  He secured most of the Labour Party, the Tories, and Carson for\r\nLloyd George; without them the Prime Minister could never have formed a\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSir Max Aitken wanted more than a Peerage for his work; he had hoped for\r\na position of tremendous power, but the Government made him a Lord and he\r\nwent back to Canadian publicity.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nImagination tries to conceive of any Englishman coming over here to merge\r\nBorden, Laurier and Crerar.  Imagination fails.  Not even Aitken could\r\nhave done it.  That he succeeded in England where he must have failed in\r\nCanada must have reasons.\r\n\r\n1. Experience in mergers.\r\n\r\n2. Prestige as a Canadian.\r\n\r\n3. Advantage of being--Max Aitken.\r\n\r\nThe first we understand.  The second involves the Empire.  Aitken was--if\r\nanything that could be labelled--a Tory.  He had no trouble becoming a\r\nUnionist.  His success with Bonar Law made it possible in getting rid of\r\nAsquith.  He could call Carson \"Edward\".  He could think as fast as Lloyd\r\nGeorge.  It was a time for quick thinking--and action.  He had opened all\r\nthe heavy doors in Montreal--and closed them upon all but those he wanted\r\ninside.  He tried the same thing in England.  His audacity was inspired.\r\nSomething had to be done.  Somebody must be the middleman.  Aitken had an\r\nuncanny faculty for sizing up situations; for manipulating men; for\r\ninterpreting ambition--because no man in England had an ambition\r\nsurpassing his own.  He could play political chess and absorb superficial\r\nculture at the same time.  Books, plays, authors, artists, manners,\r\naccent--all were grist to his mill.  He was an astute actor.  He could\r\nassume a virtue; simulate anxiety; hover about closed doors on tiptoe;\r\nspeak in the awed whisper; in the event of a crisis peer tragically into\r\nmen's faces.\r\n\r\nEngland knew she had taken a queer character to bosom; a child who was\r\ngrowing up at Gargantuan speed, an _enfant terrible_ of sudden and\r\nprodigious experience; a creature who could sit up o' nights and plot and\r\norganize and cabal and next morning rub out the wrinkles at tennis,\r\namiable if he beat his opponent, growling and savage if beaten, ready for\r\na campaign in the afternoon, a speech in the evening and a conference at\r\nmidnight.  Or he could plunge into polite arts, talk familiarly of\r\nliterature with duchesses, undergo a surgical operation to-day and sit up\r\nfor correspondence to-morrow.  He has a brain whose recipe for complete\r\nrest is \"change of work\"!  Barring Lloyd George and De Valera, he has\r\nperhaps the most unusual brain in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nNo Canadian, already a millionaire, had ever done these things.  Not even\r\nGilbert Parker had so amazingly cultivated the accent.  Greenwood,\r\ndiligent and talented, had been slow and determined.  Aitken--opened the\r\nheavy doors.  As in Canada, he was at last able to close out all but\r\nthose who could play the game of the hour.  This Canadian could not only\r\ntalk, but act, Empire; not merely ape, but superficially assimilate,\r\nEngland; and he understood the United States--because he was\r\ntemperamentally something of an American.\r\n\r\nHis success on the surface is incomprehensible.  The one key to it is his\r\npersistent cultivation of Bonar Law, who in the Coalition was the great\r\nprop to the Premier.  Beaverbrook hugely admires Lloyd George.  He\r\nreverences Bonar Law.  The Premier and himself had too many points,\r\nthough not characteristics, in common to become running mates.\r\nIntimately congenial to the Unionist leader, Aitken was never allowed to\r\nbecome indispensable to the Premier.  His brief term as member of the War\r\nCabinet terminated almost suddenly.  Was it voluntary?  Or ambitious?\r\nWhat did this Warwick want as reward more than the peerage which may have\r\nbeen designed to chloroform an electric battery?\r\n\r\nWe are not told.  Once during the second year of war he offered to raise\r\nand equip and command a battalion from New Brunswick.  His offer was not\r\naccepted.  He went to Sam Hughes.  \"Sam,\" he said, \"I want a job in the\r\nCanadian Army!\"\r\n\r\nHe got it.  Aitken's work as Eye Witness to the Canadian troops and the\r\npublication of \"Canada in Flanders\" was the performance of a man who in\r\nthe great crisis of war had found a sudden and sincere interest in his\r\nnative land that he had never exhibited while he was a citizen of this\r\ncountry.  He showed a grasp of the human as well as the technical side of\r\nwar.  A man who could so rediscover his own nation could surely do\r\nsomething new in helping to co-ordinate the Empire.  He has an\r\nastonishing knowledge of great public men in all countries, a thorough\r\ncommercial knowledge of Europe and Asia, and--may we say a genius for a\r\nsort of secret diplomacy?  His war record demonstrates most of these\r\nqualities.  His Canadian War Memorials are a proof that he understands\r\nhow to make his own country useful to British artists.\r\n\r\nWhat then did Beaverbrook expect as reward for his political services,\r\nbeyond a peerage and the sublime sense of having \"done his duty\" where he\r\nsaw it?\r\n\r\nGovernor-Generalship of Canada?\r\n\r\nAmbassadorship to the United States?\r\n\r\nSecretaryship of State for the \"Colonies\"?\r\n\r\nOr the Chancellorship of the Exchequer?\r\n\r\nThere is really nothing else left for an ambition like this except the\r\nPremiership of Great Britain.  Brilliant, plotting, crafty and\r\nphenomenal, this young man has still the spirit of the corsair.  England\r\nhas not absorbed him.  But there is a general election pending over\r\nthere.  The Coalition is not on Gibraltar.  Party cleavages are rife.\r\nLabour, Liberals, Socialists, Syndicalists, Bolshevists and old-line\r\nUnionists are all pitching camps about the Premier's Verdun.  When the\r\nbattle really begins will Gen. Beaverbrook be in the citadel, or working\r\nin a headquarters tent to merge any three of the common enemy into a\r\nforce that will haul down the Coalition flag?\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think Lloyd George will come back as powerfully as ever?\" he\r\nwas asked here, after his admission that for the time being the Premier\r\nwas in the doldrums of unpopularity.\r\n\r\n\"Because--he always does!\" was his cautious reply; in which one almost\r\ndetected the suspicion that he might not; and if so--what?\r\n\r\nThese are some of the unpredictables.  Even the answer Beaverbrook\r\nhimself might give to-day might be challenged by his action of to-morrow.\r\nBut this man has always succeeded in finance when a country was\r\nprosperous, and in politics when the nation was confronted by emergency.\r\nHe is still too ambitious to adjourn permanently to Leatherhead, Surrey;\r\ntoo young to write his memoirs.  England is a new world.  And it may\r\nbe--unless he has already alienated his personality from his genius--that\r\none of its picturesque discoverers will be Lord Beaverbrook.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he remarks that most of his friends are in Canada.  One misses\r\nat least a fumbling guess, if in the days to come he will not value those\r\nfriends, whoever they may be, more than he ever did when he was making\r\nmillions here or merging politicians over there.  Such a man seldom moves\r\nhis forces just for parade.  As Aitken used this country to get himself\r\npreferment in England on account of the Empire, so it may be suspected\r\nthat he has used England--not impossibly--to reclaim in this country\r\nwhatever credit he lost some time before he left it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile until the Government of Great Britain finds some better\r\nfunction for this phenomenon, we recommend that he be made the official\r\neconomic investigator of the Empire.  Up to the present this has been a\r\npastime for leisured travellers like Lord Southesk, Sir Charles Dilke,\r\nand Rider Haggard.  A man with Beaverbrook's ability to analyze economic\r\nconditions and gain the confidence of men in high positions could be of\r\nincalculable value in getting a thorough survey of the commercial and\r\npolitical resources of a commonwealth which as yet nobody seems to\r\nunderstand.  After that the Government might well make him Viceroy of\r\nIndia, where he might apply his talent for group-coalition to the great\r\nproblem of constitutional Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA Canadian newspaperman once flippantly asked the late W. T. Stead:\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about continentalism in North America?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came just as flippantly:\r\n\r\n\"Every nation has a right to go to the devil in its own way.  Canada\r\nshould not be denied the privilege.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a blunt candour about the reply that even from an egotist like\r\nStead meant infinitely more than the soothing-syrup idealism dispensed by\r\nsome of the visiting prophets to this country.  Stead did not mean that\r\nin establishing independence of the United States, Canada should cut the\r\npainter from the Great British Commonwealth.  But he was a trifle cynical\r\nabout the young nation, just as Disraeli was fifty years ago when he said\r\nthat \"these colonies would yet be a millstone about Britain's neck\".\r\nNeither of them was more cynical about us than we usually are about\r\nourselves, never in theory, but in practice.\r\n\r\nMost of the men sketched in the foregoing pages, as well as hundreds of\r\nothers in public life, realize that Parliament and Legislatures have a\r\nhard time to keep themselves from going to the devil, and that so far as\r\nthey go along that road the nation travels with them.  As an experiment\r\nin nationhood we have some peculiar and original weaknesses, as well as\r\nstrengths.  Belgium, for instance, could be tacked by Atlas overnight on\r\nto one of our northward coasts, or set down as an island in some of our\r\nnorthern waters, when only a geographer would notice the difference.\r\nBelgium has a king and two million more people than Canada.  We have\r\nslightly more territory than the United States, when New York State alone\r\nhas as many people as our whole country.  We are as big as many Britains\r\nand we have enough railway mileage to make Britain a spider-web, when our\r\npopulation is about one-fifth of hers and our ultimate authority in\r\ndemocratic government comes from Downing Street.  Yet there are prophets\r\namong us who predict that we shall yet be the pivot of the Empire.\r\n\r\nOnce you begin to speculate about the future of this country there is no\r\nend.  And the past of the nation has rather little to do with estimating\r\nits future.  We have been a wide-open immigration country.  In twenty\r\nyears we have transformed ourselves by a foreign policy with which\r\nBritain had nothing to do.  Twenty years more and we could do it again\r\nwith even more disastrous results.  In 1867 the great compromise known as\r\nConfederation tied four and a half millions of people into a political\r\nunity.  In half a century we doubled our population; built 30,000 miles\r\nof transcontinental and branch lines of railway; made ourselves a race\r\ncongress imitation of the United States; enacted a National Policy of\r\nprotective tariffs that failed to protect us from ourselves; created an\r\nOriental problem on the Pacific, exaggerated a race problem on the\r\nOttawa, and developed an American-penetration system clear across the\r\ncountry; sent a small army to help establish a similar government and\r\ndual problem to our own in South Africa and a huge army to Europe to help\r\nmake the world safe for the kind of democracy of which we consider\r\nourselves a fair sample; created a small army of millionaires and had\r\nbestowed upon us about an equal number of knighthoods as well as a number\r\nof peerages, and four years ago petitioned the King through Parliament to\r\nabolish the practice; gave a first mortgage on the country to one great\r\ntranscontinental railway, and a second and a third to two more which we\r\nhave since nationalized into government ownership because the roads were\r\nbankrupt for the present and built for the future, which is yet a long\r\nway off; developed a cycle of quite remarkable big industries and\r\nfederalized banks which a large element of our heterogeneous democracy\r\nnow consider a menace to the nation; and on the prairies which, shortly\r\nafter Confederation, we bought for a few millions sterling from the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, a Liberal Government, never contemplated by the\r\nFathers of Confederation, carved out two new great Provinces which for\r\nten years have tried to kill the Tory Party which gave the Northwest its\r\nbirth, all Liberalism that does not go back to the furrow, and aims to\r\nabolish even the moderately successful economic system by which we have\r\ncome to our present state of comparative prosperity.\r\n\r\nIf that is the kind of thing that Stead meant by \"every nation going to\r\nthe devil in its own way\" it must be conceded that we have lost no time\r\nover the going.  We are among the forward nations, even though we are\r\nless radical than Australia.  No young nation ever accomplished visibly\r\nand materially so much in so brief a period.  We had the enormous\r\nscientific resources of the 20th century to give us momentum.  Perhaps we\r\nwere a little too fast on the down grade.  We still take some inspiration\r\nfrom looking at the map to reflect that no other part of the British\r\nEmpire occupies so strategic a position as Canada.  We note that Canada\r\nis not only the natural interpreter between Britain and the United\r\nStates--which it took some of our far-seeing statesmen a long while to\r\ndiscover--but that we are also a transformer between the power-house at\r\nDowning Street and the one at Tokio; that we are fair on the highway of\r\ntraffic and travel between London and Yokohama; that we have room within\r\na reasonable time for as many people as are now living in Britain, and\r\nthat if we are not too awfully anxious about going to the devil we can\r\nmake that population one of the most potential in the world for its size,\r\nnot only in producing things to eat and wear and export, but in helping\r\nto hold the British Commonwealth steady long enough to let the old thing\r\nwork out its big share of the world's salvation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the outlook.  Meanwhile we have our innate defects, the first of\r\nwhich arises from the vastness of geography and the littleness of\r\npoliticians.  Little politics in Canada are pocketed away in sections.\r\nSome of our native born are the most parochial.  There are groups in\r\nCanada as un-national as Eskimos who in some respects are our best\r\ncitizens because they owe nothing to, and expect nothing from, any\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nPeople shout about assimilation, not knowing to what pattern, if any,\r\nforeign peoples should be assimilated.  The missionary goes abroad and\r\nextracts from the heathen even the nobilities of his own faith and leaves\r\nhim often the miserable animosities of a creed.  Political and social\r\nmissionaries in Canada make the same mistake about foreigners.  It is a\r\ngreat thing to Canadianize a race.  But we ought to begin by\r\nCanadianizing some of our native-born.\r\n\r\nEven our public men believe in political servitude.  A man goes to Ottawa\r\nburning with zeal to inaugurate political liberation.  Six months or a\r\nyear produces sleeping-sickness.  He is given a hyperdemic [Transcriber's\r\nnote: hypodermic?] of conformity.  He gravitates into the formula of a\r\ngroup.  His message is muzzled.  If not, it too often breaks loose in a\r\ntirade on behalf of some section littler than even any of the groups in\r\nOttawa.\r\n\r\nBig men do not, as is often said, go into Parliament.  There is a great\r\nreason.  The wonder is that the few big men we elect stay there so long.\r\nGovernment is supposed to be business.  But the business takes a long\r\nwhile to do--even badly.  Ottawa is the place where the national\r\nfield-glasses too often get turned wrong end about.\r\n\r\nWe are seldom honest about public men.  A man's own party praises, the\r\nopposite party damns him.  In an old nation this intellectual strabismus\r\nis pardonable.  In a young nation it is a form of political suicide.  We\r\ntoo often wait for a man to make a great speech before admitting\r\nindependent of party, that he is anything great as a man.\r\n\r\nBecause Canada is so vast, political leaders find it necessary to\r\nenunciate one doctrine here, another one there.  This is an old trick;\r\nplaying the lights on stage when the spot-light is reserved for the big\r\nlocal issues.  We are constantly besieged by \"national policies\".  Many\r\nof them have very little to do with national citizenship.  Most of them\r\nsketch out milleniums that are never realized.  We are a people of\r\nextremisms.  When national prosperity is the objective we tolerate, and\r\neven idolize, any man who is bold and big enough to capture the country\r\nwith his special-interest programme.  Then the delirium is over, heyday\r\nis done, and the nation wakes up to classify as public plunderers the\r\nvery men whom it once regarded as the economic saviours of the country.\r\n\r\nOur faculty of national criticism is not as yet strongly developed.\r\nThank heaven, we are not cynical; but it is better to be a hopeful cynic\r\nthan a disgruntled idealist.  Men will arise with specious programmes by\r\nmeans of which they can hypnotize a group and aim at capturing the\r\ncountry.  Progress carries on by means of such men and such groups.  But\r\nthe devil himself stands behind the stage bush to prod these zealots into\r\nthe limelight and the next moment to lead the claque in the gallery.  We\r\nare carried away by the act, afterwards find that we have been duped and\r\nhold indignation meetings after the show is safely ten miles down the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nLike all other nations we have had our share of \"the new time coming\".\r\nDuring the war we had all the old parties dead and buried along with\r\npatronage and race cries and public graft.  But while the preacher was\r\nbusy over the funeral rites a number of chief mourners were somewhere\r\n\"making hay\".  A nation's adversity is too often some man's opportunity.\r\nIn moneymaking this is even worse than in politics.  It is too easy to\r\nshout and to shed tears.  We deplore the past, suspect the future and\r\nwork hard to make ourselves solid for the present.\r\n\r\nMany men in Canada do not regard public life as public service.  There is\r\nlittle or no preparation for doing the nation's business.  Men are\r\nlog-rolled into Parliament and pitchforked into Cabinets.  The work they\r\nare expected to do has little or no relation to the work for which nature\r\nand experience intended them.  It is regarded a simpler matter to\r\nadminister a great State department than to manage a big industry.\r\n\r\nOttawa is the natural objective of all those who \"want\" something.  When\r\ninterests camp on the trail of Governments and of Parliament, the\r\ninterest of the nation is going to suffer--and it always has.  We are\r\npaying in taxes now for the lobbying that went on ten years ago.  No\r\nGovernment is ever considered so patriotic and humanly powerful that can\r\nresist the inroad of \"big interests\".\r\n\r\nBigger interests arise.  In a storm of newly patented virtue they declaim\r\nagainst the \"big\" ones.  They fail to admit that they merely want to\r\nusurp instead of to magnify Government.  The political machine of the\r\ncountry is regarded as a part of the machine by which special interests\r\nprosper.  In its efforts to repudiate such a connection Governments\r\nresort to the trick of clamouring on behalf of \"the people\".\r\n\r\nPresently even the people lose faith in Government.  They come to believe\r\nonly in class-conscious groups.  No nation can be big whose parties are\r\nsmall.  No parties can be great whose platforms are for the good of a\r\nclass or the veneration of what \"my grandfather\" used to think.\r\n\r\nElections are eternally war.  A general election has for a sure sign the\r\nprediction on the part of the Opposition that the Government intend to\r\n\"put one over\" in order to grab another lease of power.  Experience has\r\ntaught us that the prediction is too often true.  It does not teach us\r\nthat it is time to abandon the expectation or the practice.  Men who in\r\nparty bondage have helped to win elections by redistribution after a\r\ncensus, and to award patronage to the victors, arise years later in\r\nOpposition to denounce such practices when carried on by the present\r\nGovernment.  The pot usually succeeds in calling the kettle black.  Hence\r\na bad black eye to political sincerity.\r\n\r\nThe average parliamentarian knows very little about Canada; much about\r\nhis own Province, or his own constituency, or his own group.  Politicians\r\ndo not even travel except on business.  A country of vast and variegated\r\nhuman interest, of wonderful charm even for scenery, without considering\r\npeople at all, is the home of a large number of people burning to do\r\nnational work who know little or nothing about the life of the nation,\r\nhistorically or otherwise.\r\n\r\nPresident Harding solemnly predicts that the United States will produce a\r\nrace of supermen.  He does not say how.  He merely observes the need.  He\r\nknows that his country has gone the pace that will take generations of\r\ncoming back before any superman nation can begin to be.  In Canada we\r\nhave not gone so far that we cannot easily come back.  But we have no\r\nvision of any future for this nation except a larger instalment of what\r\nwe have been.\r\n\r\nWe talk about being a nation when we ignore the very disadvantages that\r\nmilitate against true nationalism.  We bluster about national sentiment\r\nand spend our money on paying to have ourselves Americanized.  When we\r\nare tired trying to explain that, we fall back into dithyrambics on the\r\nOld Flag and the great British Empire.\r\n\r\nBut if we are ever going to be anything but a national and polyglot\r\nsandwich between the United States and Great Britain, it is time we paid\r\nsome respect to the innate democracy of the British idea by developing\r\nour own national identity.  Our strategic position in the Empire will be\r\nworth no more to us than our great native resources, or our bilingual\r\nnationalism, or our pioneering history, or all combined, unless we elect\r\nto make the biggest and best we have dominate our national life.  This is\r\na big country that must become a great nation if those who aim to lead it\r\nwill abstain from little ways.  We need more poetry in our public\r\naffairs.  More imagination in Parliament.  More vision in the\r\nAdministration.  More faith in the country.  Less sectionalizing\r\npropaganda everywhere.  If we rise to the measure of opportunity, we may\r\nyet prove that when the Fathers of Confederation hung our national future\r\non a great compromise and a transcontinental railway they were not\r\ntalking in their sleep; and that when Empire statesmen look to our\r\nleaders for counsel we shall not send unto them any man who represents a\r\nclass-conscious economic group instead of a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Governments have always capitulated to groups.  We have\r\nsacrificed a great deal for the sake of protection when that was merely a\r\ntariff to keep certain industries from obliteration.  But a nation cannot\r\nbe forever built upon smoke-stacks and blue-books.  We can better afford\r\nto have continental free trade and spiritual freedom as a nation, than a\r\nhigh tariff and bondage to an industrial-financial-transportation group.\r\nBut if we gobble the bait of free trade, and find ourselves on the hook\r\nof economic and national domination by the United States, our last state\r\nwill surely be worse than our first.",
