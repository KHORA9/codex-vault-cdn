OVERVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 1997: 1,000 books; April 2002: 5,000 books; October 2003: 10,000 books;\r\nJanuary 2005: 15,000 books; December 2006: 20,000 books; April 2008: 25,000\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nIn July 1971, Michael Hart created Project Gutenberg with the goal of making\r\navailable for free, and electronically, literary works belonging to public\r\ndomain. A pioneer site in a number of ways, Project Gutenberg was the first\r\ninformation provider on the internet and is the oldest digital library. When the\r\ninternet became popular, in the mid-1990s, the project got a boost and an\r\ninternational dimension. The number of electronic books rose from 1,000 (in\r\nAugust 1997) to 5,000 (in April 2002), 10,000 (in October 2003), 15,000 (in\r\nJanuary 2005), 20,000 (in December 2006) and 25,000 (in April 2008), with a\r\ncurrent production rate of around 340 new books each month. With 55 languages\r\nand 40 mirror sites around the world, books are being downloaded by the tens of\r\nthousands every day. Project Gutenberg promotes digitization in “text format”,\r\nmeaning that a book can be copied, indexed, searched, analyzed and compared with\r\nother books. Contrary to other formats, the files are accessible for\r\nlow-bandwidth use. The main source of new Project Gutenberg eBooks is\r\nDistributed Proofreaders, launched in October 2000 by Charles Franks to help in\r\nthe digitizing of books from public domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A BET SINCE 1971\r\n\r\n\r\n= In a Few Words\r\n\r\nIf the print book is 5 centuries and a half old, the electronic book is only 37\r\nyears old. It is born with Project Gutenberg, created by Michael Hart in July\r\n1971 to make available for free electronic versions of literary books belonging\r\nto public domain. A pioneer site in a number of ways, Project Gutenberg was the\r\nfirst information provider on an embryonic internet and is the oldest digital\r\nlibrary. Long considered by its critics as impossible on a large scale, Project\r\nGutenberg counted 25,000 books in April 2008, with tens of thousands downloads\r\ndaily. To this day, nobody has done a better job of putting the world's\r\nliterature at everyone's disposal. And to create a vast network of volunteers\r\nall over the world, without wasting people's skills or energy.\r\n\r\nDuring the fist twenty years, Michael Hart himself keyed in the first hundred\r\nbooks, with the occasional help of others from time to time. When the internet\r\nbecame popular, in the mid-1990s, the project got a boost and an international\r\ndimension. Michael still typed and scanned in books, but now coordinated the\r\nwork of dozens and then hundreds of volunteers in many countries. The number of\r\nelectronic books rose from 1,000 (in August 1997) to 2,000 (in May 1999), 3,000\r\n(in December 2000) and 4,000 (in October 2001).\r\n\r\n37 years after its birth, Project Gutenberg is running at full capacity. It had\r\n5,000 books online in April 2002, 10,000 books in October 2003, 15,000 books in\r\nJanuary 2005, 20,000 books  in December 2006 and 25,000 books in April 2008,\r\nwith 340 new books available per month, 40 mirror sites in a number of\r\ncountries, books downloaded by the tens of thousands every day, and tens of\r\nthousands of volunteers in various teams.\r\n\r\nWhether they were digitized 30 years ago or they are digitized now, all the\r\nbooks are captured in Plain Vanilla ASCII (the original 7-bit ASCII), with the\r\nsame formatting rules, so they can be read easily by any machine, operating\r\nsystem or software, including on a PDA, a cell phone or an eBook reader. Any\r\nindividual or organization is free to convert them to different formats, without\r\nany restriction except respect for copyright laws in the country involved.\r\n\r\nIn January 2004, Project Gutenberg had spread across the Atlantic with the\r\ncreation of Project Gutenberg Europe. On top of its original mission, it also\r\nbecame a bridge between languages and cultures, with a number of national and\r\nlinguistic sections. While adhering to the same principle: books for all and for\r\nfree, through electronic versions that can be used and reproduced indefinitely.\r\nAnd, as a second step, the digitization of images and sound, in the same spirit.\r\n\r\n= Beginning and Persevering\r\n\r\nLet us get back to the beginnings of the project. When he was a student at the\r\nUniversity of Illinois (USA), Michael Hart was given $100,000,000 of computer\r\ntime at the Materials Research Lab of his university. On July 4, 1971, on\r\nIndependence Day, Michael keyed in The United States Declaration of Independence\r\n(signed on July 4, 1776) to the mainframe he was using. In upper case, because\r\nthere was no lower case yet. But to send a 5 K file to the 100 users of the\r\nembryonic internet would have crashed the network. So Michael mentioned where\r\nthe eText was stored (though without a hypertext link, because the web was still\r\n20 years ahead). It was downloaded by six users. Project Gutenberg was born.\r\n\r\nMichael decided to use this huge amount of computer time to search the public\r\ndomain books that were stored in our libraries, and to digitize these books. He\r\nalso decided to store the electronic texts (eTexts) in the simplest way, using\r\nthe plain text format called Plain Vanilla ASCII, so they can be read easily by\r\nany machine, operating system or software. A book would become a continuous text\r\nfile instead of a set of pages, with caps for the terms in italic, bold or\r\nunderlined of the print version.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he defined Project Gutenberg's mission: to put at everyone's\r\ndisposal, in electronic versions, as many literary works of the public domain as\r\npossible for free. As he stated years later, in August 1998, \"We consider eText\r\nto be a new medium, with no real relationship to paper, other than presenting\r\nthe same material, but I don't see how paper can possibly compete once people\r\neach find their own comfortable way to eTexts, especially in schools.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he keyed in The United States Declaration of Independence in 1971, Michael\r\nwent on in 1972 and typed in a longer text, The United States Bill of Rights,\r\nthat includes the ten first amendments added in 1789 to the Constitution (dated\r\n1787) and defining the individual rights of the citizens and the distinct powers\r\not the Federal Government and the States. In 1973, Michael typed in the full\r\ntext of The United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nFrom one year to the next, disk space was getting larger, by the standards of\r\nthe time (there was no hard disk yet), so it was possible to plan bigger files.\r\nMichael began typing in the Bible, because the individual books of the Bible\r\ncould be processed separately as different files. He also worked on the\r\ncollected works of Shakespeare, with one play at a time, and a file for each\r\nplay. That edition of Shakespeare was never released, due to copyright changes.\r\nIf Shakespeare's works belong to the public domain, the comments and notes may\r\nbe copyrighted, depending on the publication date. But other editions belonging\r\nto the public domain were posted a few years later.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, the internet, which was still embryonic in 1971, was born in 1974\r\nwith the creation of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)\r\nby Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. Its rapid expansion started in 1983.\r\n\r\n= 10 to 10,000 Books\r\n\r\nIn August 1989, Project Gutenberg completed its 10th book, The King James Bible,\r\nthat was first published in 1611, with the standard text dated 1769. In 1990,\r\nthere were 250,000 internet users, and the standard was 360 K disks. In January\r\n1991, Michael typed in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\r\n(published in 1865). In July 1991, he typed in Peter Pan, by James M. Barrie\r\n(published in 1904). These two worldwide classics of childhood literature each\r\nfitted on one disk.\r\n\r\n1991 was also the year the web became operational. The first browser, Mosaic,\r\nwas released in November 1993. As the web was becoming a popular medium, it\r\nbecame easier to circulate eTexts and recruit volunteers. Project Gutenberg\r\ngradually got into its stride, with the digitization of one book per month in\r\n1991, two books per month in 1992, four books per month in 1993 and eight books\r\nper month in 1994. In January 1994, Project Gutenberg celebrated its 100th book\r\nby releasing The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. Shakespeare wrote most\r\nof his work between 1590 and 1613. The steady growth went on, with an average of\r\n8 books per month in 1994, 16 books per month in 1995, and 32 books per month in\r\n1996.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, from 1991 to 1996, the \"output\" doubled every year. While\r\ncontinuing to digitize books, Michael was also coordinating the work of dozens\r\nof volunteers. At the end of 1993, Project Gutenberg's eTexts were organized\r\ninto three main sections: a) \"Light Literature\", such as Alice's Adventures in\r\nWonderland, Peter Pan or Aesop's Fables; b) \"Heavy Literature\", such as the\r\nBible, Shakespeare's works or Moby Dick; c) \"Reference Literature\", such as\r\nRoget's Thesaurus, and a set of encyclopaedias and dictionaries. This\r\norganization in three sections was abandoned later for a more detailed\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg's goal is to be \"universal\" both for the literary works that\r\nare chosen and the audience who reads them. The goal is to put literature at\r\neveryone's disposal. With a focus on books that many people would use\r\nfrequently, and not only students and teachers. For example, the \"Light\r\nLiterature\" section is intended for pre-schoolers as well as their grandparents.\r\nThe aim is that they will want to look up the eText of Peter Pan when they come\r\nback from watching Hook at the movies. Or that they will read the eText of\r\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland after seeing it on TV. Or that they will look\r\nfor the context of a quotation after hearing it in one of the Star Trek\r\nepisodes; nearly every episode of Star Trek quotes from books which are in the\r\nProject Gutenberg collections.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that, whether they were avid readers of print books or not in the\r\npast, people should easily be able to look up quotations they hear in\r\nconversations, movies, music, or they read in books, newspapers and magazines,\r\nwithin a library containing all these quotations in an easy-to-use format.\r\neTexts don't take up much space in ASCII format. They can be easily downloaded\r\nwith a standard phone line. Searching a word or a phrase is simple too. People\r\ncan easily search an entire eText by using the plain \"search\" menu available in\r\nany program.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the \"output\" was still an average of 32 books per month. In June 1997,\r\nProject Gutenberg released The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, by Howard Pyle\r\n(published in 1883). In August 1997, it released its 1000th book, La Divina\r\nCommedia di Dante (published in 1321), in Italian, its original language.\r\n\r\nIn August 1998, Michael wrote: \"My own personal goal is to put 10,000 eTexts on\r\nthe Net [editor's note: his goal was reached in October 2003] and if I can get\r\nsome major support, I would like to expand that to 1,000,000 and to also expand\r\nour potential audience for the average eText from 1.x% of the world population\r\nto over 10%, thus changing our goal from giving away 1,000,000,000,000 eTexts to\r\n1,000 times as many, a trillion and a quadrillion in US terminology.\"\r\n\r\n= 1,000 to 10,000 Books\r\n\r\nFrom 1998 to 2000, there was a steadfast average of 36 new books per month. In\r\nMay 1999, there were 2,000 books. The 2000th book was Don Quijote, by Cervantes\r\n(published in 1605), in Spanish, its original language.\r\n\r\nReleased in December 2000, the 3000th book was the third volume of A l'ombre des\r\njeunes filles en fleurs (In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower), by Marcel\r\nProust (published in 1919), in French, its original language. Around 104 books\r\nper month were released in 2001.\r\n\r\nReleased in October 2001, the 4000th book was The French Immortals Series, in\r\nEnglish. Published in 1905 by Maison Mazarin, Paris, this book is an anthology\r\nof short fictions by authors belonging to the renowned French Academy (Académie\r\nfrançaise), notably Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de\r\nBernard and Alphonse Daudet.\r\n\r\nAvailable in April 2002, the 5000th book was The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nwhich he wrote at the beginning of the 16th century. A text that is steadily in\r\nthe Top 100 of downloaded texts.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Michael Hart chose to digitize Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and\r\nPeter Pan because they each fitted on one 360 K disk, the standard of the time.\r\nFifteen years later, in 2002, 1.44 M is the standard disk and ZIP is the\r\nstandard compression. The practical file size is about 3 million characters,\r\nmore than long enough for the average book. The digitized ASCII version of a\r\n300-page novel is 1 M. A bulky book can fit in two ASCII files, that can be\r\ndownloaded as is or in ZIP format.\r\n\r\nAn average of 50 hours is necessary to get an eText selected, copyright-cleared,\r\nscanned, proofread, formatted and assembled.\r\n\r\nA few numbers are reserved for \"special\" books. For example, eBook number 1984\r\nis reserved for George Orwell's classic, published in 1949, and still a long way\r\nfrom falling into the public domain.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, around 100 books were released per month. In Spring 2002, Project\r\nGutenberg's books represented 1/4 of all the public domain works freely\r\navailable on the web and listed nearly exhaustively by the Internet Public\r\nLibrary (IPL). An impressive result thanks to the relentless work of thousands\r\nof volunteers in several countries.\r\n\r\n1,000 books in August 1997, 2,000 books in May 1999, 3,000 books in December\r\n2000, 4,000 books in October 2001, 5,000 books in April 2002, 10,000 books in\r\nOctober 2003. eBook number 10000 is The Magna Carta, the first English\r\nconstitutional text, signed in 1215. From April 2002 to October 2003, in 18\r\nmonths, the number of books doubled, going from 5,000 to 10,000, with a monthly\r\naverage of 300 new digitized books.\r\n\r\n10,000 books. An impressive number if we think about all the scanned and\r\nproofread pages this number represents. A fast growth thanks to Distributed\r\nProofreaders, a website launched in October 2000 by Charles Franks to share the\r\nproofreading of books between many volunteers. Volunteers choose one of the\r\nbooks listed on the site and proofread a given page. They don't have any quota\r\nto fulfill, but it is recommended they do a page per day if possible. It doesn't\r\nseem much, but with hundreds of volunteers it really adds up.\r\n\r\nBooks are also copied on CDs and DVDs. Blank CDs and DVDs cost next to nothing,\r\nas does their burning on a CD or DVD writer. Project Gutenberg sends a free CD\r\nor DVD to anyone who asks for it, and people are encouraged to make copies for a\r\nfriend, a library or a school. Released in August 2003, the \"Best of Gutenberg\"\r\nCD contained over 600 books, as a follow-up to other CDs in the past). The first\r\nProject Gutenberg DVD was released in December 2003 to celebrate the landmark of\r\n10,000 books, with most of the existing titles (9,400 books).\r\n\r\n= 10,000 to 20,000 Books\r\n\r\nIn December 2003, there were 11,000 books digizited in several formats, most of\r\nthem in ASCII, and some of them in HTML or XML. This represented 46,000 files,\r\nand 110 G. On 13 February 2004, the day of Michael Hart's presentation at\r\nUNESCO, in Paris, there were exactly 11,340 books in 25 languages. In May 2004,\r\nthe 12,581 books represented 100,000 files in 20 different formats, and 135\r\ngigabytes. With more than 300 new books added per month (338 books in 2004), the\r\nnumber of gigabytes is expected to double every year.\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) was officially affiliated to\r\nProject Gutenberg in 2003. Since 1997, PGCC had been working on gathering\r\ncollections of existing eBooks, as a complement to Project Gutenberg which was\r\nfocusing on the production of eBooks.\r\n\r\nIn December 2003, Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP EUrope) were launched by\r\nProject Rastko, followed by Project Gutenberg Europe (PG Europe) in January\r\n2004. Project Gutenberg Europe celebrated its first 100 books in June 2005.\r\nThese books were in several languages, a reflection of European linguistic\r\ndiversity, with 100 languages planned for the long term.\r\n\r\nIn January 2005, Project Gutenberg reached the landmark of 15,000 books. eBook\r\nnumber 15000 is The Life of Reason, by George Santayana (published in 1906). In\r\nJuly 2005, Project Gutenberg of Australia (launched in 2001) reached the\r\nlandmark of 500 books. New teams were getting ready to launch Project Gutenberg\r\nCanada, Project Gutenberg Portugal and Project Gutenberg Philippines over the\r\nnext years.\r\n\r\nWhat about languages? If there where were works in 25 languages only in February\r\n2004, there were works in 42 languages in July 2005, including Iroquoian,\r\nSanskrit and the Mayan languages. On July 27, 2005, out of a total of 16,800\r\nbooks, the seven \"main\" languages were: English (with 14,548 books), French (577\r\nbooks), German (349 books), Finnish (218 books), Dutch (130 books), Spanish (103\r\nbooks) and Chinese (69 books). There were books in 50 languages in December\r\n2006. On December 16, 2006, out of a total of 19,996 books, the main languages\r\nwere English (17,377 books), French (966 books), German (412 books), Finnish\r\n(344 books), Dutch (244 books), Spanish (140 books), Italian (102 books),\r\nChinese (69 books), Portuguese (68 books) and Tagalog (51 books).\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, Project Gutenberg reached the landmark of 20,000 books. eBook\r\nnumber 20000 was the audio book of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Vingt\r\nmille lieues sous les mers), by Jules Verne (published in 1869). Half of these\r\n20,000 books were produced by Distributed Proofreaders since October 2000, with\r\na monthly average of 346 new digitized books in 2006. If 32 years were necessary\r\nto digitize the first 10,000 books, between July 1971 and October 2003, 3 years\r\nand 2 months were necessary to digitize the following 10,000 books, between\r\nOctober 2003 and December 2006. Project Gutenberg of Australia was about to\r\nreach 1,500 books (this goal was achieved in April 2007) and Project Gutenberg\r\nEurope reached 500 books.\r\n\r\nThe section Project Gutenberg PrePrints was set up in January 2006 to collect\r\nitems submitted to Project Gutenberg which for some reason were interesting\r\nenough to be available online, but not quite ready yet to be added to the main\r\nProject Gutenberg collection, the reason being for example missing data,\r\nlow-quality files, formats which were not handy, etc. This new section had 379\r\nfiles in December 2006.\r\n\r\n= 20,000 to 25,000 Books\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg News began in November 2006 with Mike Cook as its editor and\r\nwebmaster, as a complement to the weekly and monthly newsletters that had\r\nexisted since a number of years. The website gives for example the weekly,\r\nmonthly and yearly production stats since 2001. The weekly production was 24\r\nbooks in 2001, 47 books in 2002, 79 books in 2003, 78 books in 2004, 58 books in\r\n2005, 80 books in 2006 and 78 books in 2007. The monthly production was 104\r\nbooks in 2001, 203 books in 2002, 348 books in 2003, 338 books in 2004, 252\r\nbooks in 2005, 345 books in 2006 and 338 books in 2007. The yearly production\r\nwas 1,244 books in 2001, 2,432 books in 2002, 4,176 books in 2003, 4,058 books\r\nin 2004, 3,019 books in 2005, 4,141 books in 2006 and 4,049 books in 2007.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg of Canada (PGC) was founded on July 1st, 2007, on Canada Day,\r\nby Michael Shepard and David Jones, and Distributed Proofreaders of Canada (DPC)\r\nstarted production in December 2007. There were 100 books in March 2008, with\r\nbooks in English, French and Italian.\r\n\r\nThe combined Project Gutenberg projects have produced a total of 26,161 titles\r\nin 2007.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg sent out 15 million books via snail mail in 2007, under the\r\nform of CDs and DVDs. Dated July 2006, the latest DVD included 17,000 books.\r\nSince 2005, CD and DVD files have also been periodically generated as ISO files\r\nto be downloaded and used to make a CD or DVD using a CD or DVD writer.\r\n\r\nAs for volunteers, Distributed Proofreaders (DP), who started production in\r\nOctober 2000, had over 52,000  volunteers in January 2008. DP processed 11,934\r\nbooks since its beginnings. Distributed Proofreaders of Europe (DP Europe), who\r\nstarted production in December 2003, had over 1,500 volunteers in January 2008.\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC), who started production in December 2007,\r\nhad over 250 volunteers in January 2008.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached the landmark of 25,000 books in April 2008. eBook\r\nnumber 25000 was English Book Collectors, by William Younger Fletcher (published\r\nin 1902). On April 21, 2008, out of a total of 25,004 books, the main languages\r\nwere English (21,475 books), French (1,168 books), German (530 books), Finnish\r\n(433 books), Dutch (326 books), Portuguese (217 books), Chinese (196 books),\r\nSpanish (180 books), Italian (128 books), Latin (55 books) and Tagalog (54\r\nbooks). And there were books in Esperanto (45 books), Swedish (40 books), Danish\r\n(20 books), Catalan (19 books), Welsh (10 books), Norwegian (10 books), Russian\r\n(7 books), Icelandic (7 books), Hungarian (7 books), Middle English (6 books),\r\nGreek (6 books) and Bulgarian (6 books).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether digitized years ago or now, all the books are digitized in 7-bit plain\r\nASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), called Plain Vanilla\r\nASCII. Used since the beginnings of computing, it is the set of unaccented\r\ncharacters present on a standard English-language keyboard (A-Z, a-z, numbers,\r\npunctuation and other basic symbols). When 8-bit ASCII (also called ISO-8859 or\r\nISO-Latin) is used for books with accented characters like French or German,\r\nProject Gutenberg also produces a 7-bit ASCII version with the accents stripped.\r\n(This doesn't apply for languages that are not \"convertible\" in ASCII, like\r\nChinese, encoded in Big-5.)\r\n\r\nPlain Vanilla ASCII is the best format by far. It is \"the lowest common\r\ndenominator\". It can be read, written, copied and printed by any simple text\r\neditor or word processor on any electronic device. It is the only format\r\ncompatible with 99% of hardware and software. It can be used as it is or to\r\ncreate versions in many other formats. It will still be used while other formats\r\nwill be obsolete (or are already obsolete, like formats of a few short-lived\r\nreading devices launched since 1999). It is the assurance collections will never\r\nbe obsolete, and will survive future technological changes. The goal is to\r\npreserve the texts not only over decades but over centuries. There is no other\r\nstandard as widely used as ASCII right now, even Unicode, a \"universal\" encoding\r\nsystem created in 1991.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg also publishes books in well-known formats like HTML, XML or\r\nRTF. There are Unicode files too. Any other format provided by volunteers (PDF,\r\nLIT, TeX and many others) is usually accepted, as long as they also supply an\r\nASCII version where possible.\r\n\r\nBut a large scale conversion into other formats is handed over to other\r\norganizations. For example Blackmask Online, which uses Project Gutenberg's\r\ncollections to offer thousands of free books in eight different formats based on\r\nthe Open eBook (OeB) format. Or Manybooks.net, which converts Project\r\nGutenberg's books into formats readable on PDAs. Or Mobilebooks, with 5,000\r\nbooks in Java (.jar) format that can be downloaded from the website to be read\r\non a cell phone. Or Wattpad, a free service for reading and sharing stories on a\r\nmobile phone. Once downloaded to your phone, the service gives instant access to\r\nworks from Project Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nAs a volunteer, the wisest thing to do is to choose a book published before\r\n1923. It is also required that copyright clearance be confirmed prior to working\r\non any book by sending a photocopy of the title page and verso page (even if the\r\nlatter is blank) to Michael Hart. The pages should be sent as scans to be\r\nuploaded on the website. For people who cannot create scans, it is possible to\r\nsend photocopies by postal mail. The pages will then be filed, either on paper\r\nor electronically, so that the proof will be available in the future, to\r\ndemonstrate if necessary that the book is in the public domain under the US law.\r\nProject Gutenberg doesn't release any book until the book's copyright status has\r\nbeen confirmed.\r\n\r\nWhat is entailed exactly, once copyright clearance is received? Digitization is\r\ndone by scanning the book page after page to get \"image\" files. Then volunteers\r\nrun an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to convert \"image\" files\r\ninto text files. Then each text file is proofread (i.e. re-read and corrected)\r\nby comparing it to the \"image\" file or the original page of the print version.\r\nThere is an average of 10 mistakes per page for a good OCR package, and many\r\nmore mistakes if the quality of the scanner and the OCR package is not great.\r\n\r\nThe book is proofread twice on the computer screen by two different people, who\r\nmake any corrections necessary. When the original is in poor condition, as with\r\nvery old books, it is keyed in manually, word by word. Some volunteers\r\nthemselves prefer to type short texts, or works they particularly like. But most\r\nbooks are scanned, \"OCRized\" and proofread.\r\n\r\nContrary to digitization in \"image format\", which consists only in scanning the\r\npages, digitization in \"text format\" adds the OCR step: a) the book can be\r\ncopied, indexed, searched, analyzed and compared with other books; b) it is\r\npossible to search the content of the book with the \"Find\" button available in\r\nany browser and any software, without a specific search engine.\r\n\r\nThe assets of digitization in \"text format\" are numerous. It makes a smaller and\r\nmore easily sendable computer file, unlike digitization in \"image format\", which\r\nproduces a bulky \"photo\" file. Contrary to other formats, the files are\r\naccessible for low-bandwidth use. They can be copied as much as needed to\r\nproduce new digital or print versions for free. The typos pointed out after the\r\ntext is released can be fixed at any time. Readers can change the font and size\r\nof characters, the margins or the number of lines per page. Visually impaired\r\nreaders can increase the letter size. Blind readers can use speech recognition\r\nsoftware. All this is very difficult, if not impossible, with many other\r\nformats.\r\n\r\nIf the books released are 99.9% accurate in the eyes of the general reader, the\r\ngoal is not to create authoritative editions, and to argue with a picky reader\r\nwhether a certain sentence should have a colon instead of a semi-colon between\r\nits clauses.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg is convinced that proofreading by human beings is a very\r\nimportant step, and that this step makes all the difference. The use of scanned\r\nbooks as is --converted to text format by OCR software with no proofreading--\r\ngives a much lower quality result. After running OCR software, the text is 99%\r\nreliable, in the best of cases. After proofreading, the text becomes 99.95%\r\nreliable (a high percentage which is also the standard at the Library of\r\nCongress).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Project Gutenberg's perspective is rather different from that\r\nof the Internet Archive. In its Text Archive, books are scanned and \"OCRized\",\r\nbut they are not proofread. The main formats used are XML, TIF and DjVu. Books\r\nare not proofread either in other main collections: Open Content Alliance (OCA),\r\nGoogle Books Search or Microsoft Live Books Search.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg provides a \"Nearly Full Text\" search (on the first 100 K of\r\neach file) using Google, with a database updated approximately monthly. It also\r\nprovides a search of book metadata (author, title, brief description, keywords)\r\nas a participant in Yahoo!'s Content Acquisition Program, with a database\r\nupdated weekly. Both are available in the Online Book Catalog (at the bottom of\r\nthe page). In the Advanced Search, several fields can be filled: author, title,\r\nsubject, language, category (any, audio book, music, pictures), LoCC (Library of\r\nCongress Catalog classification), filetype (text, PDF, HTML, XML, JPEG, etc.),\r\nand eText/eBook No. A field \"Full Text\" was also added as an experimental\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nOn Project Gutenberg's website, a File Recode Service allows users to convert\r\nbooks in one format (ASCII, ISO-8859, Unicode and others) into another, and vice\r\nversa. A much more powerful conversion program may be launched in the future,\r\nwith a conversion into still more formats (XML, HTML, PDF, TeX, RTF), including\r\nBraille and voice. It will then also be possible to choose the font and size of\r\ncharacters and the background color. Another eagerly expected conversion is that\r\nof a book from one language to another by machine translation software. This may\r\nbe possible in a few years, when machine translation is accurate to 99%. Still,\r\nthese books will certainly need some proofreading too by human translators.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SHARED PROOFREADING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main \"leap forward\" of Project Gutenberg in the last few years is due to\r\nDistributed Proofreaders. Distributed Proofreaders was launched in October 2000\r\nby Charles Franks to help in the digitizing of public domain books. Originally\r\nmeant to assist Project Gutenberg in the handling of shared proofreading,\r\nDistributed Proofreaders became the main source of Project Gutenberg books. In\r\n2002, Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site. In May\r\n2006, Distributed Proofreaders became a separate entity and continues to\r\nmaintain a strong relationship with Project Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nVolunteers don't have a quota to fill, but it is recommended they do a page a\r\nday if possible. It doesn't seem much, but with hundreds of volunteers it really\r\nadds up. In 2003, about 250-300 people were working each day all over the world,\r\nproducing a daily total of 2,500-3,000 pages, the equivalent of two pages a\r\nminute. In 2004, the average was 300-400 proofreaders participating each day,\r\nand finishing 4,000-7,000 pages per day, the equivalent of four pages a minute.\r\nThe number of books that have been processed through Distributed Proofreaders\r\nhas grown fast, with a total of 3,000 books in February 2004, 5,000 books in\r\nOctober 2004 and 7,000 books in May 2005, 8,000 books in February 2006 and\r\n10,000 books in March 2007, with five books produced per day and 52,000\r\nvolunteers in December 2007.\r\n\r\nFrom the website one can access a program that allows several proofreaders to be\r\nworking on the same book at the same time, each proofreading on different pages.\r\nThis significantly speeds up the proofreading process. Volunteers register and\r\nreceive detailed instructions. For example, words in bold, italic or underlined,\r\nor footnotes are always treated the same way for any book. A discussion forum\r\nallows them to ask questions or seek help at any time. A project manager\r\noversees the progress of a particular book through its different steps on the\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\nThe website gives a full list of the books that are: a) completed, i.e.\r\nprocessed through the site and posted to Project Gutenberg; b) in progress, i.e.\r\nprocessed through the site but not yet posted, because currently going through\r\ntheir final proofreading and assembly; c) being proofread, i.e. currently being\r\nprocessed. On August 3, 2005, 7,639 books were completed, 1,250 books were in\r\nprogress and 831 books were being proofread. On May 1st, 2008, 13,039 books were\r\ncompleted, 1,840 books were in progress and 1,000 books were being proofread.\r\n\r\nEach time a volunteer (proofreader) goes to the website, s/he chooses a book,\r\nany book. One page of the book appears in two forms side by side: the scanned\r\nimage of one page and the text from that image (as produced by OCR software).\r\nThe proofreader can easily compare both versions, note the differences and fix\r\nthem. OCR is usually 99% accurate, which makes for about 10 corrections a page.\r\nThe proofreader saves each page as it is completed and can then either stop work\r\nor do another. The books are proofread twice, and the second time only by\r\nexperienced proofreaders. All the pages of the book are then formatted, combined\r\nand assembled by post-processors to make an eBook. The eBook is now ready to be\r\nposted with an index entry (title, subtitle, author, eBook number and character\r\nset) for the database. Indexers go on with the cataloging process (author's\r\ndates of birth and death, Library of Congress classification, etc.) after the\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nVolunteers can also work independently, after contacting Project Gutenberg\r\ndirectly, by keying in a book they particularly like using any text editor or\r\nword processor. They can also scan it and convert it into text using OCR\r\nsoftware, and then make corrections by comparing it with the original. In each\r\ncase, someone else will proofread it. They can use ASCII and any other format.\r\nEverybody is welcome, whatever the method and whatever the format.\r\n\r\nNew volunteers are most welcome too at Distributed Proofreaders (DP),\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) and Distributed Proofreaders Canada\r\n(DPC). Any volunteer anywhere is welcome, for any language. There is a lot to\r\ndo. As stated on both websites, \"Remember that there is no commitment expected\r\non this site. Proofread as often or as seldom as you like, and as many or as few\r\npages as you like. We encourage people to do 'a page a day', but it's entirely\r\nup to you! We hope you will join us in our mission of 'preserving the literary\r\nhistory of the world in a freely available form for everyone to use'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5. BECOMING MULTILINGUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about languages? First Project Gutenberg's books are mostly in English. As\r\nit has been based in the United States since 1971, it has focused on the\r\nEnglish-speaking community in the country and worldwide. Multilingualism started\r\nin 1997.\r\n\r\nIn October 1997, Michael Hart expressed his intention to include books in other\r\nlanguages. At the beginning of 1998, the catalog had a few titles in French (10\r\ntitles), German, Italian, Spanish and Latin. In July 1999, Michael wrote: \"I am\r\npublishing in one new language per month right now, and will continue as long as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nIn February 2004, there were works in 25 languages. In July 2005, there were\r\nworks in 42 languages, including Iroquoian, Sanskrit and the Mayan languages.\r\nThe seven main languages -- with more than 50 books -- were English, French,\r\nGerman, Finnish, Dutch, Spanish and Chinese. In December 2006, there were books\r\nin 50 languages. They were ten main languages, the above ones plus Italian,\r\nPortuguese and Tagalog. In April 2008, there were books in 55 languages, with\r\neleven main languages, the above ones plus Latin. Esperanto was not far with 45\r\nbooks, and Swedish followed with 40 books.\r\n\r\nFrench is the second main language after English. On February 13, 2004, there\r\nwere 181 books in French (out of a total of 11,340 books). On May 16, 2005,\r\nthere were 547 books in French (out of a total of 15,505 books). The number\r\ntripled in 15 months. On July 27, 2005, there were 577 books in French (out of a\r\ntotal of 16,800 books). On December 16, 2006, there were 966 books in French\r\n(out of a total of 19,996 books). On April 21, 2008, there were 1,168 books in\r\nFrench (out of a total of 25,004 books). The number of French books is expected\r\nto rise significantly in a few years, when Project Gutenberg Europe will run at\r\nfull speed.\r\n\r\nWhat were the first books posted in French? They were six novels by Stendhal and\r\ntwo novels by Jules Verne, all released in early 1997. The six novels by\r\nStendhal were: L'Abbesse de Castro, Les Cenci, La Chartreuse de Parme, La\r\nDuchesse de Palliano, Le Rouge et le Noir and Vittoria Accoramboni. The two\r\nnovels by Jules Verne were: De la terre à la lune and Le tour du monde en\r\nquatre-vingts jours. In early 1997, whereas Project Gutenberg offered no English\r\nversion of any of Stendhal's writings (yet), three of Jules Verne's novels were\r\navailable in English: 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (original title: Vingt mille\r\nlieues sous les mers), posted in September 1994; Around the World in 80 Days\r\n(original title: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours), posted in January\r\n1994 and From the Earth to the Moon (original title: De la terre à la lune),\r\nposted in September 1993. Stendhal and Jules Verne were followed by Edmond\r\nRostand with Cyrano de Bergerac, posted in March 1998.\r\n\r\nIn late 1999, the \"Top 20\" --the 20 most downloaded authors-- included Jules\r\nVerne at 11 and  Emile Zola at 16. They still have a very good ranking in the\r\npresent \"Top 100\".\r\n\r\nAs a side remark, the first \"images\" ever made available by Project Gutenberg\r\nwere French Cave Paintings, posted in April 1995, with an XHTML version posted\r\nin November 2000. This book contains four photos of paleolithic paintings found\r\nin a grotto located in Ardèche, a region of south-eastern France. These photos,\r\nwhich are copyrighted, were made available to Project Gutenberg thanks to Jean\r\nClottes, a French general curator for cultural heritage (conservateur général du\r\npatrimoine), for everyone to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, multilingualism became one of the priorities of Project Gutenberg, like\r\ninternationalization. Michael Hart went off to Europe, with stops in Paris,\r\nBrussels and Belgrade. He gave a lecture on February 12, 2004 at UNESCO (United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) headquarters in\r\nParis. He chaired a discussion at the French National Assembly on February 13.\r\nThe following week, he addressed the European Parliament, in Brussels. He also\r\nmet with the team of Project Rastko, in Belgrade, to support the creation of\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (launched in December 2003) and Project\r\nGutenberg Europe (launched in January 2004).\r\n\r\nThe launching of Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) by Project Rastko\r\nwas indeed a very important step. DP Europe uses the software of the original\r\nDistributed Proofreaders and is dedicated to the proofreading of books for\r\nProject Gutenberg Europe. Since its very beginnings, DP Europe has been a\r\nmultilingual website, with its main pages translated into several European\r\nlanguages by volunteer translators. DP Europe was available in 12 languages in\r\nApril 2004 and 22 languages in May 2008.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal is 60 languages and 60 linguistic teams representing all the\r\nEuropean languages. When it gets up to speed, DP Europe will provide books for\r\nseveral national and/or linguistic digital libraries, for example Projet\r\nGutenberg France for France. The goal is for every country to have its own\r\ndigital library (according to the country copyright limitations), within a\r\ncontinental network (for France, the European network) and a global network (for\r\nthe whole planet).\r\n\r\nA few lines now on Project Rastko, which launched such a difficult and exciting\r\nproject for Europe, and catalysed volunteers' energy in both Eastern and Western\r\nEurope (and anywhere else: as the internet has no boundaries, there is no need\r\nto live in Europe to register). Founded in 1997, Project Rastko is a\r\nnon-governmental cultural and educational project. One of its goals is the\r\nonline publishing of Serbian culture. It is part of the Balkans Cultural Network\r\nInitiative, a regional cultural network for the Balkan peninsula in\r\nsouth-eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn May 2005, Distributed Proofreaders Europe finished processing its 100th\r\neBook. In June 2005 Project Gutenberg Europe was launched with these first 100\r\nbooks. PG Europe operates under \"life +50\" copyright laws. DP Europe supports\r\nUnicode to be able to proofread books in numerous languages. Created in 1991 and\r\nwidely used since 1998, Unicode is an encoding system that gives a unique number\r\nfor every character in any language, contrary to the much older ASCII that was\r\nmeant only for English and a few European languages.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 2005, 137 books were completed (processed through the site and\r\nposted to Project Gutenberg Europe), 418 books were in progress (processed\r\nthrough the site but not yet posted, because currently going through their final\r\nproofreading and assembly), and 125 books were being proofread (currently being\r\nprocessed). On May 10th, 2008, 496 books were completed, 653 books were in\r\nprogress and 91 books were being proofread.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. PUBLIC DOMAIN VS. COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated in the Project Gutenberg FAQ, \"the public domain is the set of\r\ncultural works that are free of copyright, and belong to everyone equally\", i.e.\r\nthat books that can be digitized to be freely available on the internet. But the\r\ntask of Project Gutenberg isn't made any easier by the increasing restrictions\r\nto the public domain. In former times, 50% of works belonged to the public\r\ndomain, and could be freely used by everybody. A much tougher legislation was\r\nset in place over the centuries, step by step, especially during the 20th\r\ncentury, despite our so-called \"information society\". In 2100, 99% of works\r\nmight be governed by copyright, with a meager 1% for public domain.\r\n\r\nIn the Copyright HowTo section, Project Gutenberg presents its own rules for\r\nconfirming the public domain status of books according to US copyright laws.\r\nHere is a summary. Works published before 1923 entered the public domain no\r\nlater than 75 years from the copyright date. (All these works are now in the\r\npublic domain.) Works published between 1923 and 1977 retain copyright for 95\r\nyears. (No such works will enter the public domain until 2019.) Works created\r\nfrom 1978 on enter the public domain 70 years after the death of the author if\r\nthe author is a natural person. (Nothing will enter the public domain until\r\n2049.) Works created from 1978 on enter the public domain 95 years after\r\npublication (or 120 years after creation) if the author is a corporate one.\r\n(Nothing will enter the public domain until 2074.) Other rules apply too. The\r\ncopyright law was amended 11 times between 1976 and now.\r\n\r\nMuch more restrictive than the previous one, the current legislation became\r\neffective after the promulgation of amendments to the 1976 Copyright Act, dated\r\nOctober 27th, 1998. As explained by Michael Hart in July 1999: \"Nothing will\r\nexpire for another 20 years. We used to have to wait 75 years. Now it is 95\r\nyears. And it was 28 years (+ a possible 28 year extension, only on request)\r\nbefore that, and 14 years (+ a possible 14 year extension) before that. So, as\r\nyou can see, this is a serious degrading of the public domain, as a matter of\r\ncontinuing policy.\"\r\n\r\nThese amendments were a major blow for digital libraries and deeply shocked\r\ntheir founders, beginning with Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg in\r\n1971, and John Mark Ockerbloom, founder of The Online Books Page in 1993. But\r\nhow were they to measure up to the major publishing companies?\r\n\r\nMichael wrote in July 1999: \"No one has said more against copyright extensions\r\nthan I have, but Hollywood and the big publishers have seen to it that our\r\nCongress won't even mention it in public. The kind of copyright debate going on\r\nis totally impractical. It is run by and for the 'Landed Gentry of the\r\nInformation Age.' 'Information Age'? For whom?\"\r\n\r\nJohn wrote in August 1999: \"I think it's important for people on the web to\r\nunderstand that copyright is a social contract that's designed for the public\r\ngood -- where the public includes both authors and readers. This means that\r\nauthors should have the right to exclusive use of their creative works for\r\nlimited times, as is expressed in current copyright law. But it also means that\r\ntheir readers have the right to copy and reuse the work at will once copyright\r\nexpires. In the US now, there are various efforts to take rights away from\r\nreaders, by restricting fair use, lengthening copyright terms (even with some\r\nproposals to make them perpetual) and extending intellectual property to cover\r\nfacts separate from creative works (such as found in the \"database copyright\"\r\nproposals). There are even proposals to effectively replace copyright law\r\naltogether with potentially much more onerous contract law.\"\r\n\r\nThe political authorities continually speak about an information age while\r\ntightening the laws relating to the dissemination of information. The\r\ncontradiction is obvious. This problem has also affected Australia (forcing\r\nProject Gutenberg of Australia to withdraw dozens of books from its collections)\r\nand several European countries. In a number of countries, the rule is now life\r\nof the author plus 70 years, instead of life plus 50 years, following pressure\r\nfrom content owners, with the subsequent \"harmonization\" of national copyright\r\nlaws as a response to the \"globalization of the market\".\r\n\r\nBut there is still hope for some books published after 1923. According to Greg\r\nNewby, director of PGLAF (Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation), one\r\nmillion books published between 1923 and 1964 could also belong to the public\r\ndomain, because only 10% of copyrights were actually renewed. Project Gutenberg\r\ntries to locate these books. In April 2004, with the help of hundreds of\r\nvolunteers at  Distributed Proofreaders, all Copyright Renewal records were\r\nposted for books from 1950 through 1977. So, if a given book published during\r\nthis period is not on the list, it means the copyright was not renewed, and the\r\nbook fell into the public domain. In April 2007, Stanford University used this\r\ndata to create a Copyright Renewal Database, searchable by title, author,\r\ncopyright date and copyright renewal date.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. FROM THE PAST TO THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bet made by Michael Hart in 1971 succeeded. Project Gutenberg counted 10\r\nbooks online in August 1989; 100 books in January 1994; 1,000 books in August\r\n1997; 2,000 books in May 1999; 3,000 books in December 2000; 4,000 books in\r\nOctober 2001; 5,000 books in April 2002; 10,000 books in October 2003; 15,000\r\nbooks in January 2005; 20,000 books in December 2006 and 25,000 books in April\r\n2008.\r\n\r\nBut Project Gutenberg's results are not only measured in numbers, which can't\r\ncompete yet with the number of print books in the public domain. The results\r\nalso include the major influence that the project has had. As the oldest\r\nproducer of free books on the internet, Project Gutenberg has inspired many\r\nother digital libraries, for example Projekt Gutenberg-DE for classic German\r\nliterature and Projekt Runeberg for classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature, to\r\nname only two, which started respectively in 1992 and 1994.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg keeps its administrative and financial structure to the bare\r\nminimum. Its motto fits into three words: \"Less is more\". The minimal rules give\r\nmuch space to volunteers and to new ideas. The goal is to ensure its\r\nindependence from loans and other funding and from ephemeral cultural\r\npriorities, to avoid pressure from politicians or economic interests. The aim is\r\nalso to ensure respect for the volunteers, who can be confident their work will\r\nbe used not just for decades but for centuries. Volunteers can network through\r\nmailing lists, weekly or monthly newsletters, discussion lists, wikis and\r\nforums.\r\n\r\nDonations are used to buy equipment and supplies, mostly computers and scanners.\r\nFounded in 2000, the PGLAF (Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation) has\r\nonly three part-time employees.\r\n\r\nMore generally, Michael should be given more credit as the real inventor of the\r\nelectronic book (eBook). If we consider the eBook in its etymological sense,\r\nthat is to say a book that has been digitized to be distributed as an electronic\r\nfile, it is now 37 years old and was born with Project Gutenberg in July 1971.\r\nThis is a much more comforting paternity than the various commercial launchings\r\nin proprietary formats that peppered the early 2000s. There is no reason for the\r\nterm \"eBook\" to be the monopoly of Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and others. The\r\nnon-commercial eBook is a full eBook, and not a \"poor\" version, just as\r\nnon-commercial electronic publishing is a fully-fledged way of publishing, and\r\nas valuable as commercial electronic publishing. Project Gutenberg eTexts are\r\nnow called eBooks, to use the recent terminology in the field.\r\n\r\nIn July 1971, sending a 5K file to 100 people would have crashed the network of\r\nthe time. In November 2002, Project Gutenberg could post the 75 files of the\r\nHuman Genome Project, with files of dozens or hundreds of megabytes, shortly\r\nafter its initial release in February 2001, because it was public domain. In\r\n2004, a computer hard disk costing US$140 could potentially hold the entire\r\nLibrary of Congress. And we probably are only a few years away from a storage\r\ndisk capable of holding all the print media of our planet.\r\n\r\nWhat about documents other than text? In September 2003, Project Gutenberg\r\nlaunched Project Gutenberg Audio eBooks. As of December 2006, there are 367\r\ncomputer-generated audio books and 132 human-read audio books. The number of\r\nhuman-read books should greatly increase over the next few years. There were 412\r\nbooks in May 2008. As for computer-generated books, they won't be stored in a\r\nspecific section any more, but \"converted\" when requested from the existing\r\nelectronic files in the main collections. Voice-activated requests will be\r\npossible, as a useful tool for visually impaired readers.\r\n\r\nLaunched at the same time, The Sheet Music Subproject is dedicated to digitized\r\nmusic sheet. It also contains a few music recordings. Some still pictures and\r\nmoving pictures are also available. These new collections should take off in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut digitizing books remains the priority, and there is a big demand, as\r\nconfirmed by the tens of thousands of books that are downloaded every day. For\r\nexample, on July 31, 2005, there were 37,532 downloads for the day, 243,808\r\ndownloads for the week, and 1,154,765 downloads for the month. On May 6, 2007,\r\nthere were 89,841 downloads for the day, 697,818 downloads for the week, and\r\n2,995,436 downloads for the month. A few days later, the number of downloads for\r\nthe month hit the landmark of 3 million downloads. On May 8, 2008, there were\r\n115,138 downloads for the day, 714,323 downloads for the week, and 3,055,327\r\ndownloads for the month. This only for transfers from ibiblio.org (University of\r\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill), the main book distribution site (which also\r\nhosts the website). The Internet Archive is the backup distribution site and\r\nprovides unlimited disk space for storage and processing.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg has 40 mirror sites in many countries and is looking for new\r\nones. It also encourages the use of P2P for sharing its books.\r\n\r\nThe \"Top 100\" lists the top 100 books and the top 100 authors for the previous\r\nday, the last 7 days and the last 30 days.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg books can also help bridge the \"digital divide.\" They can be\r\nread on a computer or a secondhand PDA costing just a few dollars. Solar-powered\r\nPDAs offer a good solution in remote regions and developing countries.\r\n\r\nLater on, it is hoped machine translation software will be able to convert the\r\nbooks from one to another of 100 languages. In ten years from now, it is\r\npossible that machine translation will be judged 99% satisfactory (research is\r\nvery active on that front, but there is still a lot to do), allowing for the\r\nreading of literary classics in a choice of many languages. In 2004, Project\r\nGutenberg was in touch with a European project studying how to combine\r\ntranslation software and human translators, somewhat as OCR software is now\r\ncombined with the work of proofreaders.\r\n\r\n37 years after the beginnings of Project Gutenberg, Michael Hart describes\r\nhimself as a workaholic who devotes his entire life to his project, because he\r\nthinks electronic books will become the \"killer ap(plication)\" of the computer\r\nrevolution. He considers himself a pragmatic and farsighted altruist. For years\r\nhe was regarded as a nut but now he is respected. He wants to change the world\r\nthrough freely-available books that can be used and copied endlessly. Reading\r\nand culture for everyone at minimal cost. Project Gutenberg's mission can be\r\nstated in eight words: \"To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks,\"\r\nby everybody, and by every possible means. While implementing new ideas, new\r\nmethods and new software.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, there might be 25 million books belonging to public domain in\r\nthe main regional and national libraries in the world, without counting various\r\neditions. If Gutenberg allowed everyone to get print books at little cost,\r\nProject Gutenberg could allow everyone to get a library of electronic books at\r\nno cost on a cheap device like a USB drive. So far, in April 2008, 25,000\r\nhigh-quality books were available for free.\r\n\r\nLet us give the last word to Michael, whom I asked in August 1998: \"What is your\r\nbest experience with the internet?\" His answer was: \"The notes I get that tell\r\nme people appreciate that I have spent my life putting books, etc., on the\r\ninternet. Some are quite touching, and can make my whole day.\" Ten years later,\r\nhe confirms that his answer would still be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.
