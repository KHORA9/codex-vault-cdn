Beyond this I have had recourse to the _Edinburgh_, the\r\n_Quarterly_, the _Times_ newspaper, and various periodicals of the\r\nperiod; and I have read many of his speeches and others. In dealing with\r\nthe Crimean War I have had recourse to Mr. Kinglake’s work; and in\r\nvarious portions of my little book I have referred to other authors,\r\nwhom it may perhaps be unnecessary that I should name here. Having lived\r\nthrough a great portion of Lord Palmerston’s career, I have trusted in\r\nsome things to my recollection, when I have been able to confirm my\r\nmemory. But I must add to this short list “The Life of the Prince\r\nConsort,” by Sir Theodore Martin, in which the name of Lord Palmerston\r\nhas been brought under much discussion.\r\n\r\nSir Theodore Martin, in that work, has performed a most difficult task\r\nwith a devotion and loyalty beyond praise. There was a special merit in\r\nselecting a man who has united so true a spirit with a patience so\r\nexemplary and literary merit of such high character. And the subject of\r\nhis eulogy was certainly beyond all praise. To have found genius and\r\nconscience and industry, with assured moral convictions and a tender\r\nloving heart, to fill such a place as that occupied by the Prince\r\nConsort, has been the good fortune of England. Let men consider what\r\nmight have been the condition of the country with a Consort less gifted\r\nin any of these details than was the Prince. But with the verdict of the\r\nPrince, declared in regard to Lord Palmerston as Foreign Minister, I am\r\ncompelled to differ. It is nothing that I and another do not agree with\r\nit, but I think that I shall be able to show that England has disagreed\r\nwith his Royal Highness, and that England has been right.\r\n\r\nIt is better perhaps to say what must be said on this subject here, in\r\nthe first pages. It has to be said, or such a memoir as this would lack\r\nevery element of completeness. No man could thoughtfully undertake such\r\na task without feeling that he would have to express an opinion that the\r\nPrince was right or wrong. The Prince has been so plain-spoken, and Sir\r\nTheodore Martin has been bound to publish what the Prince has said in\r\nlanguage so resonant, that no one now dealing with Lord Palmerston’s\r\nlife can pass it over in silence.\r\n\r\nThat the Prince was conscientious, high-minded, modest in listening to\r\nthe advice of others, bold in declaring his opinion when he had formed\r\nit, and patriotic in declaring it when formed, no thinking man can\r\ndoubt. Fault was found with him at first, by men who did not think; but\r\nthat has passed by. It did not now need his “Life” to make his memory\r\nsweet to all Englishmen. He came among us and gave us his best, and\r\nlived as though we were his own. In pursuance of a theory of government\r\nwhich it was natural that he should adopt, he found fault with the\r\nMinister who, at that time, had especially dealt between us and other\r\nnations for a period of nearly twenty years. In this he followed the\r\npolitical teaching which he had received from Baron Stockmar, a German\r\npossessed of great abilities and gifted with a clear, conscientious\r\nmind. He had been left to the Prince as a legacy by his uncle, King\r\nLeopold. It can hardly be necessary to speak more in detail of Baron\r\nStockmar after the life of the Prince Consort by Sir Theodore Martin.\r\nLord Palmerston had gone to the Foreign Office in November, 1830, and\r\nwas dismissed in December, 1851. He had been out of office during six\r\nyears of that time, and, as we all understand in regard to politicians\r\nin opposition, had then watched as closely as he had worked in office.\r\nHe knew the ways of the Foreign Office. He knew the ways of the Crown.\r\nHe knew the ways of the people on whose behalf he was employed, and\r\ndoubtless had a tendency to lessen the power of the Crown rather than to\r\nincrease it, and to think more of the House of Commons year by year as\r\nyears ran on. It was only natural that with the Prince the tendencies\r\nshould be on the other side.\r\n\r\nWriting on 19th of December, 1851, Lord John Russell, who was then Prime\r\nMinister, said to Lord Palmerston:--“No other course is open to me than\r\nto submit the correspondence to the Queen, and to ask her Majesty to\r\nappoint a successor to you in the Foreign Office.” Thus did Lord John\r\nRussell dismiss Lord Palmerston. The Prince, in writing to Lord John,\r\ndeclared that the influence of England in calming down the dangerous\r\nfeelings on the Continent had been destroyed by Lord Palmerston: “This\r\ninfluence has been rendered null by Lord Palmerston’s personal manner of\r\nconducting the foreign affairs, and by the universal hatred which he has\r\nexcited on the Continent. That you could hope to control him has long\r\nbeen doubted by us, and its impossibility is clearly proved by the last\r\nproceedings.”[B]\r\n\r\nNo doubt Lord Palmerston had been rough. A man who will not be bullied\r\nwill sometimes bully. The passage is only quoted here to show the\r\ndisapproval of Lord Palmerston which existed in the mind of the Prince,\r\nand to show also how impossible it will be, in dealing with the life of\r\nPalmerston, altogether to ignore the disapproval of the Prince Consort.\r\n\r\nThe two charges brought against Lord Palmerston were, that by his\r\npersonal manner of conducting foreign affairs he had “rendered null the\r\ninfluence” of England abroad, and that he had disobeyed the orders\r\nreceived by him from the Court, through the Prime Minister. These orders\r\nrequired that time should be allowed for the reading of despatches\r\nprepared by him to be sent to Foreign Courts, and for the making of such\r\nalterations as might seem good to the Prime Minister or to the Court.\r\nThat Lord Palmerston had “rendered null” the influence of England abroad\r\nwill hardly now be conceived. It will be for me to assert, as Mr. Ashley\r\nhas well shown, that no Minister has ever more thoroughly supported\r\nEnglish interests and English influence abroad. As to a certain amount\r\nof disobedience, the disobedience of which complaint is made--I think\r\nthat it must be admitted. “There,” said the head of a Government office\r\none day, when he had just completed the writing of a set of minute\r\ninstructions to his subordinates--“if they can do all that, I’ll eat\r\nthem.” The subordinates by no means intended to be eaten; nor did Lord\r\nPalmerston. In all ranks of life there are instructions which a man must\r\nnot say that he will not obey, but will know that he cannot. So it was\r\nwith Lord Palmerston. He did not, we suppose, intend to obey those\r\ninstructions to the letter. He had instructions also from his other\r\nmaster, which made it impossible. He did intend to act as Foreign\r\nMinister to the best of his loyalty, and to the best of his patriotism.\r\n\r\nFor the truth of what is here said, I must refer the reader to the\r\nrecords of the man’s life, as about to be given;--as, indeed, they have\r\nbeen given to the same effect, but at much greater length, by Mr.\r\nAshley. Lord Palmerston proved the unassailable strength of his position\r\nby the rapidity with which he vanquished his old friend, Lord John, who\r\nhad dismissed him. How far this dismissal had been carried out by Lord\r\nJohn himself, and how far he had been urged on by the Prince and the\r\nPrince’s foreign adviser, it is not necessary that I should say. The\r\nblow had come from the hands of Lord John, and Lord Palmerston at once\r\nhit back at him. On the 19th of December, 1851, he was told to go. On\r\nthe 24th of February, 1852, he thus wrote to his brother: “I have had my\r\ntit for tat with John Russell, and I turned him out on Friday last.”\r\n\r\nTwo months had done it. And how had it been done? Lord Palmerston had\r\nfound himself called upon to fight the Prime Minister,--and the\r\nMinisters who remained in the Cabinet from which he had been\r\ndismissed,--backed by all the powers of the Crown. And certainly he\r\ncould depend in no degree on the House of Lords. It was by the House of\r\nCommons,--by his own influence there as opposed to that of Lord John\r\nRussell so supported,--that he won his victory. Having won it, he (Lord\r\nJohn) was at once deposed. This, at any rate, showed what was the\r\nopinion of those to whom England had confided the political power of the\r\ncountry. The mode of the battle and the cause which created it, must be\r\ntold further on. It soon became evident that Lord Palmerston had not\r\nbeen “smashed,” as had been declared during those months. “There was a\r\nPalmerston,” had been said by a witty statesman of the opposite party.\r\nBut it came to pass very soon that Lord Palmerston stood higher than\r\never in the councils of his country. The war, of which many men said\r\nthat it would annihilate us, had come upon us; and in four years’ time\r\nthe various Prime Ministers of the day,--Lord Aberdeen and Lord John and\r\nLord Derby,--were calling for help to the “Palmerston that was.” Indeed,\r\nhe had been one of the Cabinet again since December, 1852; and then in\r\nFebruary, 1855, himself became Prime Minister, as being the only man in\r\nEngland to whom England could trust the awful responsibility of that\r\nperiod. That was the man on whose dismissal from his councils the Prince\r\nhad congratulated the then Prime Minister, telling him that England’s\r\ninfluence was rendered null by the hatred abroad which the dismissed one\r\nhad created. This, I think, is strong proof that England did not agree\r\nwith him. Nor was the Sovereign slow to express her approval of the man\r\nwho had been so lately dismissed. “It would give her particular\r\nsatisfaction if Lord Palmerston would join in this formation,”[C]--the\r\nformation of a new Cabinet. Then he was called on himself to form a\r\nCabinet, and we are told, in a page or two further on, that “Lord\r\nPalmerston had good reason to appreciate the generosity with which his\r\nold chief had interposed to remove this formidable impediment to his\r\nsuccess. Nor was her Majesty less grateful.” So was he welcomed back to\r\nthe highest seat. Nor was the Prince slow to show himself alive to the\r\nfact that the country was best served by him whom the country had\r\nselected for its servant. But he must surely then have acknowledged to\r\nhimself that the dismissal of a Minister of whom England thoroughly\r\napproves, though it may be effected for a few months, can hardly be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThis, I think,--his dismissal from the Foreign Office which he loved so\r\nwell,--was the hardest trial to which Lord Palmerston was subjected\r\nduring his long official life. In the previous year an attack had been\r\nmade upon him in regard to Don Pacifico. It had been commenced in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and was carried on through a memorable debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons. During that period the Prince Consort had then written\r\nto Lord John:[D] “Both the Queen and myself are _exceedingly sorry_ at\r\nthe news your letter contained. We are not surprised, however, that Lord\r\nPalmerston’s mode of doing business should not be borne by the\r\nsusceptible French Government with the same good-humour and forbearance\r\nas by his colleagues.” But in that affair Lord Palmerston had so managed\r\nthat he had come out of it, not dismissed, but triumphant. In that, as\r\nwill be seen, there was no grief to him, though much trouble. But it\r\nhad all been a part of the same conscientious but, to the feeling of\r\nmany, unconstitutional operation. It was written on Lord Palmerston’s\r\nmind that he was England’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting, no\r\ndoubt, in conjunction with his colleagues, but subject to no immediate\r\ncontrol. But it was not so written on the mind of the Prince Consort.\r\nWhich idea was written on the minds of the people; and which theory was\r\nit possible that either should carry out in accordance with the practice\r\nof the country? Subsequently, when Lord Clarendon was Foreign Minister\r\nwith his entire approval, if not by his nomination, Palmerston must\r\nsurely have felt more interested in the Foreign Office than any other\r\nEnglishman. He was greatly successful afterwards as Premier, but his\r\nyears spent at the Foreign Office were those of his best activity. It is\r\nas Foreign Minister that his memory will chiefly live.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was in office altogether forty-nine years and some odd months;--all\r\nbut fifty years! No other Englishman has, I believe, ever served so\r\nlong. How should an Englishman serve so long, seeing that a young man\r\nhas to show some fitness before he is taken into office, and that then,\r\nas parties are divided in England, he has to remain out during that\r\nportion of his life in which his opponents are in? But this man did so.\r\nHe lived in all eighty-one years. Of these, twenty-two were those of his\r\nboyhood and education; he enjoyed nine of enforced rest, though during\r\nthose nine he was, with the exception of a month or two, an active\r\nmember of Parliament; the remaining fifty saw him always in Parliament,\r\nalways in office, always at the oar. They offered to make him\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, as they had also offered to make him\r\nGovernor-General of India. But he laughed at the proposal. Not to be in\r\nthe centre of everything,--at St. Stephen’s, in Downing Street, in\r\nLondon where the Mayor and the Fishmongers held their banquets, ready\r\nfor Greenwich dinners, ready for all attacks, for all explanations, for\r\nall discussions--was to him not to live. But he did live always, till at\r\neighty-one he was taken to his rest, being at the moment Prime Minister\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was by no means a man of genius, possessed of not more than\r\nordinary gifts of talent, with no startling oratory, and, above all,\r\nwith no specially strong liberal opinions. He had all that could be done\r\nfor him, both for good and evil, by a thoroughly English education of\r\nthe first class. He could fight and would fight as long as he could\r\nstand; but as conqueror he could be thoroughly generous. He could work,\r\nrequiring no rest, but only some change of employment. He shot, he\r\nhunted, he raced, he danced. But he seems to have cared for the niceties\r\nof erudition neither in classics nor in philosophy. He was a man who\r\nfrom the first was determined to do the best he could with himself; and\r\nhe did it with a healthy energy, never despairing, never expecting too\r\nmuch, never being in a hurry, but always ready to seize the good thing\r\nwhen it came. Through his active life he was fortunate in all things. He\r\navoided those scrapes to which such men are subject,--men who come early\r\ninto their fortunes and their titles, who profess to live, if not lives\r\nof pleasure, lives to which pleasure lends all her attractions. He shot,\r\nhe hunted, he raced, and he danced; but he did not drink; he did not\r\ngamble. The world has heard of no trouble into which he got about\r\nwomen. He became so popular with the world generally that the world was\r\nafraid to be censorious or to inquire into him with prying eyes. The\r\nworld called him “Cupid” when he was young, and the world said nothing\r\nof him more severe than that. He had, too, the great gift of\r\nuninterrupted physical health, without which no statesman can now do\r\ngreat things in England. Even a Pitt, were a Pitt to come now, would\r\nhardly succeed under the weight of responsibility and labour which he\r\nwould have to bear.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston began life as a Tory, and only drifted gradually into\r\nthose Whig tendencies which held him to the end of his life, rather than\r\nwere held by him. Of the Honourable Henry John Temple, the eldest son of\r\nthe Viscount Palmerston of that day, the earliest news we have is that\r\nhe was measured for his first pair of breeches on the 4th of March,\r\n1789, and that later in life complaints were made that Harry Temple was\r\ntoo sedate and wanted animal spirits;[E] and we know that he passed\r\nthrough Harrow School with fair credit and much popularity as a young\r\nnobleman. From thence he was sent to Edinburgh to listen to the teaching\r\nof Professor Dugald Stewart. The Professor thus writes about him to his\r\nold Harrow master in April, 1801. He was then sixteen. “In point of\r\ntemper and conduct he is everything his friends could wish. Indeed, I\r\ncannot say that I have ever seen a more faultless character at his time\r\nof life, or one possessed of a more amiable disposition.” It is somewhat\r\nexaggerated praise, and would hardly have been believed by Baron\r\nStockmar when, fifty years later on, he had to judge of the Foreign\r\nMinister. From Edinburgh he went to St John’s, Cambridge. His father\r\nhad previously died; and here, though we only know it from himself, he\r\nwas so “commended for the general regularity of his conduct” that he was\r\nadvised to stand for the University. In January, 1806, Mr. Pitt died,\r\nand the University had to elect a new member. Palmerston was twenty-one\r\nyears old, and was put forward as representing the Tory Government\r\nparty; but he was beaten by Lord Henry Petty and Lord Althorp,\r\nafterwards Lord Lansdowne and Lord Spencer, with both of whom he for\r\nmany years sat in the same Cabinet. He then stood for Horsham in\r\nNovember, 1806, and was returned; but he was unseated on petition. He\r\nstood again for the University, in May, 1807, and was again\r\nunsuccessful. He came in afterwards for a rotten borough, Newtown, in\r\nthe Isle of Wight. “One condition required” by the patron “was that he\r\nwould never, even for the election, set a foot in the place.”\r\n\r\nBut he had become the officer of the Government before he was a member\r\nof Parliament, having, in anticipation of his lot in life, been\r\nappointed one of the junior Lords of the Admiralty. He was nominated to\r\nthat office by the influence of Lord Malmesbury, who had been one of his\r\nguardians. His duties as such were, as he tells us, confined to the\r\nsigning of his name. The Duke of Portland was the Prime Minister, but\r\nMr. Canning was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and gave the\r\nMinistry what power it had. Soon afterwards, still in 1807, application\r\nwas made to Canning to appoint young Palmerston Under-Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, but the place had already been given away. A\r\nquarter of a century was thus left to run by, as Mr. Ashley remarks,\r\nbefore he took his place in that department.\r\n\r\nIt was Under the Duke of Portland, as a special friend and follower of\r\nCanning, that Lord Palmerston took his place as a Government servant, in\r\nApril, 1807. As such he remained, with six intervals, amounting in all\r\nto about nine years, till on 16th October, 1865, he died at Brocket\r\nHall, in Hertfordshire, in the same house in which Lord Melbourne, whose\r\nbrother-in-law he became, had previously died in 1848. For four or five\r\nmonths of his life,--in the winter of 1834-35,--he was without a seat in\r\nParliament, till in the April of that year he found himself landed in a\r\nsafe refuge in Tiverton. At the time at which he entered the Admiralty\r\nhe was not yet twenty-three years old. He possessed a fair patrimony,\r\nbut was by no means a rich nobleman. He had an Irish property in County\r\nSligo, partly in the town, but chiefly on the sea-coast. To this he paid\r\ngreat attention. I remember having been told on the spot nearly forty\r\nyears ago that that wonderful “Irishman,” Lord Palmerston, had for the\r\nlast ten years spent all his income upon the estate. He had just then\r\nbeen over, and the beauty of his presence had probably enhanced the\r\nvirtue of his operations. The family house was at Broadlands, near\r\nRomsey, in Hampshire. Here he went into the country, sometimes for a\r\nweek or two at a time, whereas other country gentlemen go for months.\r\nNothing astonishes us more than the smallness of the periods allowed to\r\nhimself by Lord Palmerston for the amusements of life. But he makes his\r\nstatements in that respect without any feeling either of surprise or\r\nself-praise. He does in one place break out into anger against a keeper\r\nwho spends his nights in the alehouse in order that the poachers may\r\nspend theirs in the coverts. “Five guns killing sixteen pheasants in\r\nYew Tree!” Yew Tree we presume to have been a wood, and certainly must\r\nhave been unsatisfactory even in 1834, when the catastrophe took place.\r\nThe Foreign Secretary going down to his own preserves with four friends,\r\nand for a very short holiday, and finding only three birds apiece among\r\nthem, cannot but have been exasperating! But Mr. Thresher, the keeper in\r\nfault, probably thought that a man so greatly occupied with foreign\r\naffairs as his master, could not want many pheasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON AS JUNIOR LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY AND SECRETARY OF WAR, APRIL,\r\n1807, TO MAY, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early years of Lord Palmerston, though he was in office, in\r\nParliament, even when he had become a Cabinet Minister, were not those\r\nby which he will be known. Pitt died about the age at which Palmerston\r\nwent to the Foreign Office, having served his country as Prime Minister\r\nfor nearly twenty years. But during that period of his comparative\r\nyouth, Lord Palmerston was always at work, gaining slowly that\r\nconsideration in the eyes of men on which his fame and strength was\r\nbuilt up. It was not in him to take Parliament by surprise, and to\r\ncaptivate the ears of all hearers by some precocious speech.\r\nNevertheless he slowly learned the art of speaking with great\r\nefficiency, and could at last carry on a debate with energy and\r\nsuccess,--as was found by the Don Pacifico speech, to which we shall\r\ncome in his sixty-sixth year, when he spoke for five consecutive hours.\r\nIn the way of speech-making, that was the greatest effort of his life;\r\nbut other orators have reached their zenith before they have become\r\nsexagenarians. Through his whole life I think that he had never spoken\r\nfor the mere sake of the effect which oratory is supposed to have. In\r\nthe mode of life to which he had fashioned himself, there constantly\r\narose matters which required speeches. When the occasion fell upon him\r\nhe could express himself. When, as Secretary of War, he had to advocate\r\na Military College, he declared that, “for his part, he wished to see\r\nthe British soldier with a British character, with British habits, with\r\na British education, and with as little as possible of anything\r\nforeign.” The argument was _ad captandum_, but it was of a nature fitted\r\nfor its purpose. Such generally were his arguments. And he could tell a\r\nstory with expressive force, as he did tell the story of Don Pacifico in\r\nhis own defence. He failed lamentably in defending himself after his\r\ndismissal from the Foreign Office,--when the witty statesman said,\r\nprematurely, that there “had been a Palmerston.” Defence by words would\r\nat that moment have been very difficult,--to have been efficacious and\r\nhot to have been disloyal! But he could answer a rowdy at the hustings\r\nwith rough, easy fun, in a manner that, with such an audience, was found\r\nto be successful. He seems to have prepared his speeches carefully when\r\nhe was young, having among his papers left the notes behind him when he\r\ndied, but to have abandoned the practice as he became accustomed to the\r\nwork. It was just what we should have expected. He looked forward as a\r\nyoung man to speaking as a necessity from which there could be no\r\nescape; but he never seems to have regarded the art as the source of his\r\npower, or the bulwark of his fame.\r\n\r\nHis first speech was in 1808, on the taking of Copenhagen. We have all\r\nread our history sufficiently to know that Nelson raised his telescope\r\nto his blind eye, or in other words, took upon himself to disobey his\r\nsuperior officer. The Danish expedition was debated, and Nelson, as we\r\nknow, got great honour for what would have ruined him had he been\r\nunsuccessful. The Ministry were attacked as to the expedition to\r\nCopenhagen, and on this occasion Lord Palmerston, as a Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, made his first speech. “My dear Elizabeth,” he says, writing\r\nto his sister, “you will see by this day’s paper that I was tempted by\r\nsome evil spirit to make a fool of myself for the entertainment of the\r\nHouse last night; however I thought it was a good opportunity of\r\nbreaking the ice, although one should flounder a little in doing so; as\r\nit was impossible to talk any egregious nonsense in so good a cause.” In\r\ntime, as he came to have more experience, he must have found that in\r\nthis he was in error. Let the case be ever so good, the oratory may be\r\nbad. But he had numbers on his side. There were 253 votes for Government\r\nand 108 against it;--and yet Palmerston complained to his sister that\r\nthe division was not so good as he had expected. He tells us he was half\r\nan hour on his legs, and did “not feel so much alarmed as I expected to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nHe had opened his lips but once in the House of Commons, when, in\r\nOctober 1809, there came a break up of the Cabinet, on the duel between\r\nCanning and Castlereagh. Mr. Percival undertook the office of Prime\r\nMinister, and offered to Palmerston the place of Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, from the duties of which he was desirous of saving himself.\r\nThe fact that he did so will chiefly be of use to us as showing the idea\r\nwhich was then held of Lord Palmerston by his elders, and the idea which\r\nhe held himself. He writes to Lord Malmesbury for advice, but he himself\r\ngives the advice on which he means to act “I have always thought it\r\nunfortunate for any one, and particularly a young man, to be put above\r\nhis proper level, as he only rises to fall the lower. Now, I am quite\r\nwithout knowledge of finance, and never but once spoke in the House.” “A\r\ngood deal of debating must of course devolve upon the person holding the\r\nChancellorship of the Exchequer. All persons, not born with the talents\r\nof Pitt or Fox, must make many bad speeches at first, if they speak a\r\ngreat deal on many subjects, as they cannot be masters of all; and a bad\r\nspeech, though tolerated in any person not in a responsible situation,\r\nwould make a Chancellor of the Exchequer exceedingly ridiculous.” And so\r\nthat matter of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer was decided. He had\r\nnot possessed the gifts which would have enabled him to be a second\r\nPitt, but he had the gift of knowing that he could not be so. He settled\r\ndown at last as Secretary at War, and, by his own judgment, decided on\r\ntaking the office without a seat in the Cabinet. Writing again to Lord\r\nMalmesbury, he says: “Percival having very handsomely given me the\r\noption of the Cabinet with the War Office (if I go to it), I thought it\r\nbest on the whole to decline it; and I trust that, although you seemed\r\nto be of a different opinion at first, you will not, on the whole, think\r\nI was wrong.” He tells us that he entered on his new functions on the\r\n27th of October, 1809. He was then twenty-five years old.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made his choice against the Cabinet, he did not enter those\r\nsacred doors till May, 1827. An apprenticeship of eighteen years was\r\nmore, probably, than he had anticipated when he made his choice. But it\r\nwas no doubt well for his future fame and his stability as a Government\r\nservant, that it should have been so. During these eighteen years he was\r\nthoroughly learning his duty as a Minister of the Crown;--learning, as\r\nsome will say, how to exaggerate those duties, and to absorb into his\r\nown hands more of power and potentiality than had been intended by those\r\nwho had appointed him. But by himself, though he thought probably but\r\nlittle about it while he was learning it, the lesson had to be learned;\r\nand the lesson taught seems to have been this, that he would interfere\r\nwith the duties of no other office than his own, but with those duties\r\nhe would put up with no interference. There may have been danger in\r\nthis; but such was his theory of official life. And it can hardly be\r\ndenied that as a Minister of State no Englishman has been more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThan Mr. Percival, who thus offered to Lord Palmerston a seat in his\r\nCabinet, no Englishman who has become Prime Minister, was ever a more\r\nprejudiced, more antiquated Tory. He was, especially, a determined\r\nProtestant, regarding any Catholic claims to the privileges of\r\ncitizenship with all the bigotry of religious conviction. At this time\r\nthe Regency began, King George III. having given place to his son, who\r\nbecame Prince Regent, and ten years afterwards George IV. But in Lord\r\nPalmerston’s early speeches, or in his parliamentary conduct, there is\r\nno allusion to any peculiar political bias, and apparently no thought of\r\nit. He had joined the Government, as other young men in lower ranks of\r\nlife join this or the other profession, and as other young men do,--or\r\nneglect to do,--did the work that came to his hands. In none of his\r\nletters that are published does there appear any strong political\r\nfeeling, as there would be nowadays, in the letters of young men who\r\nlook to parliament for distinction. He had been brought up among Tories,\r\nand was therefore a Tory; but with no violence of predilection. He was\r\nkeen rather as to the delights of the life of fashion in which he\r\nlived; but he seems to have known that such delights cease to be\r\ndelightful if they be not accompanied by work, and therefore he worked,\r\nhaving always before his eyes the future which might possibly be open to\r\nhim,--and which did eventually come to him. Throughout the next twenty\r\nyears he will be found constant at his office, for the most part silent\r\nin Parliament, but speaking, when he did speak, always with a mind\r\ngradually, but very gently, tending towards liberal principles.\r\n\r\nThen there came a change in the Government. In May, 1812, Mr. Percival\r\nwas murdered in the lobby of the House of Commons, and Lord Liverpool\r\nbecame Prime Minister. Under him there came a period of so great a glory\r\nfor England that the weakness of his administration has been forgotten\r\nin the military annals of the country. But Lord Palmerston held his\r\nplace as Secretary at War till 1827, and, on the death of Lord\r\nLiverpool, he came into the Cabinet. That such a man as Lord Liverpool\r\nshould have been head of the Government for fifteen years is not more\r\nwonderful than that such another as Lord Palmerston should during the\r\nsame long period have filled a subordinate office under him. And during\r\nthis time Waterloo had taken place, and the occupation of Paris. But our\r\nconcern is here with the subordinate, and not with the Prime Minister.\r\nHe had at last been elected by the University of Cambridge in 1812, and\r\nwas re-elected in 1818, 1820, and 1825. Very little is heard of him\r\nduring the whole of this period as a public man, and yet it was by his\r\nmouth that the taxes were suggested by which the enormous war estimates\r\nand foreign subsidies of 1813, 1814, and 1815 were supplied. He seems to\r\nhave submitted tamely to whatever Lord Liverpool proposed, and to have\r\nconsidered that, if he did his duty according to his own theory in his\r\nown office, he need not trouble his head with the political feelings of\r\nother members of the Government. He contested with Sir David Dundas and\r\nthe Duke of York the question of the power and supremacy which was\r\ninvested in them as Commanders-in-Chief, and in himself as Secretary of\r\nWar, with a determination of purpose quite worthy of the future Foreign\r\nSecretary. On these occasions neither did the Commander-in-Chief nor the\r\nSecretary at War gain any victory, the Prime Minister of the day feeling\r\nhimself to be too weak to decide against either disputant; but\r\nPalmerston seems to have held his own and to have well maintained the\r\nprestige and influence of his office.\r\n\r\nWhen the name of “Cupid” was first given to him I am unable to learn,\r\nbut it was probably during this period, and tells a tale only of the\r\nsort of life which he then led. He was the “enfant gâté” of society; but\r\nhe was not “spoiled” as regarded his official and parliamentary duties.\r\nHe was called “Cupid,” and enjoyed a peculiar popularity in all\r\nassemblies in which fashion held the sway. Men seemed to believe in him,\r\nand women too, as having a position peculiarly his own.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of a Tory Government, and yet since 1812 had voted in\r\nfavour of the Catholics whenever questions in their favour came before\r\nthe House. It seems that in 1825, when at a general election he had to\r\nstand again for the University, he expected that the influence of the\r\nGovernment would be given to Copley,--the future Lord Lyndhurst,--and to\r\nGoulburn. “I had complained,” he said, “to Lord Liverpool and the Duke\r\nof Wellington and Canning, of being attacked, in violation of the\r\nunderstanding upon which the Government was formed, and by which the\r\nCatholic question was to be an open one; and I told Lord Liverpool that\r\nif I was beaten I should quit the Government. This was the first decided\r\nstep towards a breach between me and the Tories, and they were the\r\naggressors.” And that the influence of the Government was so given there\r\ncan be no doubt, as Copley came in at the head of the poll; but still,\r\nas Lord Palmerston was enabled to keep his seat, he and Lord Liverpool\r\nwent on together in office as long as Lord Liverpool remained. “The\r\nWhigs have behaved most handsomely to me,” he says further on; “they\r\nhave given me hearty and cordial support, and, in fact, bring me in.\r\nLiverpool has acted as he always does to a friend on personal\r\nquestions,--shabbily, timidly and ill. If I am beat, I have told him he\r\nmust find another Secretary at War, for I certainly will not continue in\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\nDuring this long period we have glimpses of his life from letters to his\r\nsister Elizabeth and to his brother William, who was afterwards for some\r\nyears our Minister at Naples. He went to Paris soon after Waterloo, but\r\nnot till the Sovereigns and the Duke of Wellington had decided on\r\nsurrendering to their old owners those works of art which Napoleon had\r\nbrought to Paris. “But I rejoice most exceedingly in the thing, and\r\nwould have foregone the sight of every work of art in the gallery sooner\r\nthan have left them there. The French, however,--that is, the\r\nRoyalists,--are furious; and Lady Malmesbury, who lives almost entirely\r\nwith them, has taken it up in so tragical a tone that literally there is\r\nno talking of it to her. She says the Duke has disgraced himself, that\r\nit is _impossible_ for him to stay in Paris, and that it _must_ end in\r\nthe murder of all the English. When first she talked to me about it, I\r\nfelt like a person who is holding his countenance for a wager while\r\nsomebody tickles his nose; and when, in spite of all my endeavours, a\r\nsmirking smile crept into my face, she said, in the most serious manner,\r\n‘No, indeed, this is no laughing matter; I can assure you it is very\r\nserious indeed! The Netherland pictures are gone. The Austrians are\r\nbeginning to take the Italian school belonging to them; and then the\r\nPope takes his property. The statues will go after the pictures, and the\r\nhorses are to be taken down to-day or to-morrow!’”\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Palmerston was shot at as he was entering his office, by a\r\nmadman, one Lieutenant Davis; and I remember well to have had the spot\r\npointed out some ten years afterwards, and to have heard the story that\r\nit was chiefly by his own quickness of movement that his life was saved.\r\nWe have been told since that he supplied the money necessary for the\r\ndefence of the culprit. He afterwards visited Waterloo, and criticizes\r\nthe dirt of the Russian troops whom he saw reviewed there. He finds\r\nfault also with the reasons given for the building of a fortress at\r\nNamur, thinking that this displayed an absence of proper military spirit\r\n“I am afraid,” he says, “that our allies the Belgians want much of that\r\nspirit never to submit or yield, which is necessary to enable them\r\nsuccessfully to defend their territory.” Here we do not quite agree with\r\nhis criticism, and can only express our hope, as we pass on, that the\r\nBelgians may continue to do their work as well for the next fifty years\r\nas they have done for the last. Then we come across a remark as to an\r\nold friend of ours, which the light of subsequent years has proved to\r\nbe altogether wrong. Speaking of the army estimates, he says:\r\n“He”--Joseph Hume--“is going down hill very fast; indeed, so dull and\r\nblunder-headed a fellow, notwithstanding all his perseverance and\r\napplication, could not long hold his own in the House of Commons.”\r\nJoseph Hume, however, did hold his ground, and rose till he was believed\r\nin as the great financial reformer of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe style of Palmerston’s letters is what one would expect from that of\r\nhis speeches and despatches. It is clear, concise, and very easy to\r\nunderstand, without any approach to artificial graces, or even to the\r\nformalities of grammatical correctness. “As to weather, we are fried\r\nalive.” He mixes up his racing and his property, his art and his\r\npolitics, just as any other man would do. “I have been a horrid bad\r\ncorrespondent for some time past.” But he goes at length into his land\r\nimprovements, and tells his reader, with great zeal, of the good he has\r\nbeen doing down in Co. Sligo: “My harbour is nearly completed;--it will\r\nbe an excellent one for my purposes; it will be about one and a quarter\r\nEnglish acres in extent, and will have fourteen feet water at high\r\nspring tides,--enough depth to admit vessels of 300 tons, and as much as\r\nany harbour on the west coast of Ireland; and it has an excellent\r\nanchorage in front of it, where ships may wait the tide to enter. I have\r\nno doubt that in a short time it will be much frequented by the coasting\r\ntrade; and if I can get people--which Nimmo thinks probable--to lay down\r\na railway to it from the end of Loch Erne, a distance of fourteen\r\nEnglish miles, it would become the exporting and importing harbour for a\r\nlarge tract of very fertile country lying on the banks of that lake, and\r\nwould communicate with an inland navigation of nearly forty miles in\r\nextent.” The Nimmo named is the engineer of those days who did much good\r\nwork in the West of Ireland. “I have established an infant linen market\r\nat Cliffony, held once a month, and have no doubt of its prospering and\r\nincreasing. I have just got two schools on foot, but am at war with my\r\npriest, who, as usual, forbids the people to send their children.”\r\n\r\nThe battle for Catholic Emancipation was being carried on, and it became\r\nclearer from year to year on which side Lord Palmerston was to be\r\ncounted, in spite of his colleagues, whom he thus names: “I can forgive\r\nold women like the Chancellor, spoonies like Liverpool, ignoramuses like\r\nWestmoreland, old stumped-up Tories like Bathurst; but how such a man as\r\nPeel, liberal, enlightened, and fresh-minded, should find himself\r\nrunning in such a pack is hardly intelligible. I think he must in his\r\nheart regret those early pledges and youthful prejudices which have\r\ncommitted him to opinions so different from the comprehensive and\r\nstatesmanlike views which he takes of foreign affairs.” But even for\r\nCatholic Emancipation he had very little to say in Parliament. It cannot\r\nbe too often declared,--either as against his character as a statesman\r\nor on his behalf, as the reader may think it,--that he was not in any\r\npart of his career a man prone to speech. He was brought up in that\r\nschool of politicians in which a man uses his power of speech, or used\r\nto use it, not as a woman uses her teeth, for ornament, but as a dog\r\ndoes, for attack and defence. To have to make a speech was from the\r\nfirst to the last of his career an evil thing, though the evil became\r\nmitigated by practice, till as a personal annoyance it wore away.\r\nNevertheless there was the time lost, and the trouble necessary to be\r\ntaken, and the hours given up to the listening to other people, which\r\nmight have been so satisfactorily employed either in reading or writing,\r\nor in early years in playing Cupid, or even in shooting pheasants, if\r\nhis keeper would preserve them for him! As for his taking delight in the\r\nspeeches of others, it cannot be believed of him. Once--but he was then\r\nvery young--did he burst out into praise of Canning’s eloquence.\r\n“Canning’s speech was one of the most brilliant I ever heard. He carried\r\nthe House with him throughout.” But at that time he was not yet\r\ntwenty-four.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Liverpool died he was forty. And he had lived as a man\r\nconspicuous in the world,--in office the whole time, holding a rank\r\nthere next to that of the Cabinet, remarkable for his official\r\ncarefulness, for his industry, for his resolution to let nothing pass\r\nwithout his notice. Soon after he had joined the War Office, in 1809, he\r\nhad remarked on the insufficiency of the departmental resources. “Its\r\ninadequacy to get through the current business that comes before it is\r\nreally a disgrace to the country; and the arrear of regimental accounts\r\nunsettled is of a magnitude not to be conceived. We are now working at\r\nthe Treasury, to induce them to agree to a plan, proposed originally by\r\nSir James Pulteney and reconsidered by Granville Leveson, by which, I\r\nthink, we shall provide for the current business, and the arrear must\r\nthen be got rid of as well as we can contrive to do it.” But he had\r\nclung to his work during the whole period with that tenacity which in\r\nofficial life will get the better of all arrears. And in doing so he had\r\nmade his character known to all official men. It was not because he was\r\na good speaker, as is now generally the case, that he was chosen by one\r\nMinister after another, and that Lord Liverpool had been so anxious to\r\nretain him, but because the office work was safe in his hands, and\r\nbecause he had shown that he would make fewer mistakes than another man.\r\nHe had always the pluck to stand up for himself and his office in a\r\nbecoming manner, caring nothing for any, whether they were in\r\nopposition, or below him in office or above; whether they were in the\r\nCabinet or of royal blood, as was the Duke of York. “Come on then and\r\nfight, if it has to be.” This is what he would say, with all\r\ngood-humour; but had never any special desire to have his official\r\npoints and aspirations and beliefs made matter of debate in either House\r\nof Parliament. Such was his official character, and joined to this was\r\nhis fame as a man of fashion. He did all things that young men did, and\r\ndid them well, and at forty he was still a young man. Or if he did not\r\ndo them well, he did them as a young man of fashion ought to do them. If\r\nhe was not at first successful with his racing, he carried on the\r\namusement in the grand manner. He did not bet. It was not the fashion\r\nfor a nobleman in those days to plunge. But he kept his horses with a\r\nfirst-class trainer, and was careful to see that the stable as far as\r\npossible was made to pay its expenses. We can imagine that he was much\r\nthought of at Almack’s, and was a desired guest at the houses of all the\r\nexquisites. There is little, or indeed nothing, said about his tailors\r\nor bootmakers in any of his letters that have come to us. But we can\r\nimagine that he was very careful in his dress, without descending to the\r\noutspoken vanity of dandyism. He lived a life full to overflowing in\r\nevery direction, and on which the society of beautiful women must have\r\nhad great effect. But with beautiful women he got into no troubles.\r\nThere exists at least no record of such trouble. He passed on, a young\r\nman of fashion, for a period of twenty years, sipping all the honey from\r\nall the flowers, but without any of the usual consequences of such\r\nsipping. It was characteristic of him that neither in his early or in\r\nhis later life was there any love of display. He was a man desirous of\r\nall things that were pleasant, but seems to have wished that they should\r\nbe accorded to him simply as his deserts, and not in obedience to any\r\ndemand that he had made for them. In 1827, when he was nearly\r\nforty-three years old, he was called into the Cabinet. This formed the\r\ndividing point in his life, up to which I have regarded him as a young\r\nman, and after which I will not call him by that name though it may have\r\nbeen deserved. But I will ask my readers to remark that when that time\r\ncame he had already a long time since refused to be a Cabinet Minister;\r\nrefused to be Chancellor of the Exchequer; had twice refused to be\r\nGovernor-General of India; had refused to be the Governor of Jamaica, an\r\noffice for which George IV. seems to have thought him peculiarly\r\nqualified; and refused to be Postmaster-General, a place which in those\r\ndays required the holder to be a peer. But of the records of his life up\r\nto that period little is but now thought, and even yet three years more\r\nhad to run by, and the discreet age of forty-six had to be reached,\r\nbefore he was placed at the Foreign Office, in the administration of\r\nwhich department he will, I think, be best known in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY AT WAR, WITH SEAT IN THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a great thing to be a Cabinet Minister. Every man when he begins a\r\nlife of politics feels that. He feels it when he gets into Parliament,\r\nand when he joins a Government in some subordinate office. It is the\r\ngoal to which his hopes aspire, and the success to which his ambition\r\nventures to look. The young politician hardly expects to be Prime\r\nMinister, but he does, within his own bosom, think it possible that he\r\nmay achieve an entrance within those doors which enclose that mysterious\r\nentity which we call the Cabinet. The Cabinet is essentially English in\r\nits abnormal constitution, having grown to its present enormous\r\nresponsibility without any written rules or defined powers. There is\r\nnothing to prescribe its numbers, which do indeed vary very greatly; nor\r\nindeed is there any law requiring that this or that officer of the\r\nGovernment should be a member of it,--as there is no law by which its\r\nvery existence is made necessary. It is considered essential that the\r\nChancellor and the Secretaries of State should be of the Cabinet, but we\r\nhave no law which would be broken were it to be completed without them.\r\nBut it is understood by all men that the governing of the country is in\r\nthe hands of a small junta of individuals who form the Cabinet, and it\r\nis equally well understood that all members of the Government who are\r\nnot in the Cabinet are responsible for nothing beyond the proper\r\nperformances of their own official duties; though they, too, are bound\r\nto resign when their betters resign, and are bound also to support their\r\nbetters by parliamentary aid and judicious backing in all but the very\r\nfew matters which are regarded as “open questions.” In fact, the Cabinet\r\nMinister is a governing power, and the Minister not in the Cabinet is\r\nsimply the servant of the Premier. It is therefore undoubtedly the\r\nambition of every political servant of his country to make good his\r\nclaim to a seat in the Cabinet. And although there may now be some\r\nlittle advance in the thorough distinction of the two places since the\r\ndays in which Lord Palmerston was first enlisted as a servant of the\r\nCrown, rather more than seventy years ago, yet even then the feeling as\r\nto the power of the Cabinet Minister existed as it does now. It has been\r\ntold how, in 1809, Mr. Percival offered to make Lord Palmerston\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. “Annexed to this office he offered a seat\r\nin the Cabinet, if I chose it,” he said in a letter to Lord Malmesbury,\r\nasking for advice. “And he thought it better I should have it. I, of\r\ncourse, expressed to him how much honoured I felt by this very\r\nflattering proof of the good opinion he was pleased to entertain of me;\r\nbut also my great fears that I should find myself wholly incompetent for\r\nthe situation, both from my inexperience in the details of matters of\r\nfinance, and my want of practice in public speaking.” From this we see\r\nhow much surprised Lord Palmerston had himself been by the offer. But\r\nwith that wonderful reliance on his own power which always marked him,\r\nand which was as conspicuous when he doubted his power as when he\r\nrelied on it, he declined the offer. And he added, “A bad speech,\r\nthough tolerated in any person not in a responsible situation, would\r\nmake a Chancellor of the Exchequer exceedingly ridiculous, particularly\r\nif his friends could not set off against his bad oratory a great\r\nknowledge and capacity for business.” Actuated by these reasons, Lord\r\nPalmerston declined the offer, and then came into office simply as\r\nSecretary at War without a seat in the Cabinet. His self-diffidence was\r\nrepaid by sixteen years of comparative exclusion. Mr. Percival had been\r\nmurdered, and Lord Liverpool, who became Prime Minister in Mr.\r\nPercival’s place, had either thought less of Lord Palmerston or had been\r\nthought less of by him. The fact probably was that as Palmerston grew in\r\nyears he had learned to discard many of the ideas of Toryism, and that\r\nhe became year by year less palatable to so thorough a Tory as was Lord\r\nLiverpool. Be that as it may, we can fancy that before he reached the\r\nage of forty-three he must occasionally have looked back with\r\nwatering lips at that offer which had once been made to him.\r\nGovernor-Generalships and peerages were not to his taste. Such rich\r\nrewards would have removed him from that central and busy life which he\r\nintended for himself in the House of Commons. But the fruition of the\r\ncentral and busy life, though it had been offered to him young, had been\r\nlong delayed before it came again within his grasp. I can fancy that he\r\nmust have felt this, though in his letters there is no word of baulked\r\nexpectations or of disappointed hopes. He took it all as it came,\r\nresolving to be useful after his kind, and resolving also to be\r\npowerful. Wherever he might be, he would be interfered with by none, by\r\nKings or Kaisers, by Prime Ministers or Commanders-in-Chief, nor would\r\nhe interfere with any others in their line. I am far from saying that in\r\nthis manner a servant of his country, who is anxious to be useful rather\r\nthan powerful, may best do his duty. Lord Palmerston was a man with whom\r\nit must often have been difficult for a colleague to serve. The lines of\r\ndemarcation between one officer and another, and between one class of\r\nduty and another class, are not so plain as to make it easy if\r\npracticable, or to make it always pleasant; but this was a man with whom\r\nsuch a theory was a determined principle, and acting upon that he went\r\nto the end with greater success than might have been possible in the\r\nhands of another. He had shown his stubbornness even when not in the\r\nCabinet, and now that he was to be in the Cabinet, it was not probable\r\nthat he would become more malleable than before. I do not say that a\r\ndetermination so to act had come from that process of mind which we call\r\nthinking a thing out. It was not in his nature to think many things out\r\nbeyond the matters which he had in hand; but given the matter, it was so\r\nthat he acted. In a book just published,[F] the author speaks of “the\r\nchildish perversity which marked Lord Palmerston’s dealings with Greece\r\nin these years, from his stubborn defence of Count Armansperg down to\r\nhis disputes about etiquette.” This perversity was an essential part of\r\nLord Palmerston’s character,--and of his strength.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Lord Liverpool died, and new arrangements of the Cabinet and\r\nGovernment became necessary. Mr. Canning was selected as Prime Minister,\r\nand proceeded to form that combination which led to the adoption of\r\nCatholic Emancipation in 1829, and to the passing of the Reform Bill in\r\n1832. It has been customary to say that certain of the Whig party\r\njoined the Tories when Mr. Canning became Prime Minister. But it would\r\nperhaps be more correct to describe that which then took place as a\r\nfusion in the minds of men caused by natural changes, as in the course\r\nof years the old Tory convictions gave way to new ideas as to the\r\nliberty of the subject. The last really Tory Government in England,\r\nwhich had now become extinct, was that of Lord Liverpool and Lord Eldon;\r\nand even their Toryism grows pale when compared with that of the\r\nMinisters who had assisted George III. in taxing the Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Canning became Prime Minister, he was desirous of keeping the\r\nseals of the Foreign Office in his own hands, and with this object\r\noffered to Lord Palmerston the place of Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nwith a seat in the Cabinet. This Lord Palmerston at first accepted. But\r\nthere were difficulties in the way. “George IV., who personally hated\r\nme,” said Lord Palmerston, “did not fancy me as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. He wanted to have Herries in that office.” Whether this be\r\ntrue or not, or whether Canning changed his mind, the arrangement was\r\nnever carried out. “Some weeks after this Canning sent for me again, to\r\nsay he had a proposition to make to me, which he should not himself have\r\nthought of, but that the King had said he knew, and was sure, that it\r\nwas just the very thing I should like, and that was to go as Governor to\r\nJamaica. I laughed so heartily that I observed Canning looked quite put\r\nout, and I was obliged to grow serious again.” Canning then offered him\r\nthe Governor-Generalship of India; but Lord Palmerston refused, with\r\nsundry excuses as to his health (which he would by no means allow when\r\nthe same office was offered by him many years afterwards to Canning’s\r\nson), and alleging, also, that he had no family for whom he was desirous\r\nof amassing a fortune. In the end a Cabinet was made up by expedients\r\nintended only to be temporary. Canning was Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nas well as First Lord of the Treasury; Lord Granville, retaining his\r\nembassy at Paris, became for the time Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs; Palmerston, still keeping some hold on the Chancellorship of\r\nthe Exchequer for the future, remained Secretary at War, but with the\r\nadditional plum that he was to have the patronage of the army, no new\r\nCommander-in-Chief having been appointed in place of the Duke of\r\nWellington, who had thought it necessary to resign with his brother\r\nTories. “As to the Tories, who would hardly vote for our measures\r\nbefore, we must not look for any cordial support from them now. Not but\r\nthat, by degrees and one by one, they will all by instinct come round to\r\nthe oat-sieve.” Come round to the oat-sieve! Alas, it is sad to see a\r\npublic servant, who had already served his country for nearly twenty\r\nyears, and who was yet destined to serve it for forty years more,\r\nspeaking in such language of those by whom Cabinets are formed! But\r\nthough we may believe it of Lord Eldon, we do not believe it of the Duke\r\nof Wellington or of Sir Robert Peel,--three of the men of whom Lord\r\nPalmerston was then speaking; nor, in truth, do we believe it of Lord\r\nPalmerston himself.\r\n\r\nOf this period of Lord Palmerston’s life, we have the record left to us\r\nin a partial autobiography which he drew out afterwards, and which has\r\nbeen made known to us by Lord Dalling. In reference to this\r\nautobiography, the memory of Lord Palmerston has been laden with some\r\nreproach, which seems not altogether to be undeserved when we look at\r\nthe purposes for which it has been used. But we must remember that it\r\nwas not written, like the journal by which it is preceded, at the time\r\nof the occurrences which it relates, but many years afterwards, when it\r\nwas prepared, probably at the request of Lord Dalling to whom it was at\r\nany rate given by Lady Palmerston. Mr. Herries had been Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer in Lord Goderich’s Administration. In this autobiography\r\nthe name of Mr. Herries is mentioned with disrespect,--and we must\r\ncertainly say with inaccuracy, after the defence which has lately been\r\npublished by his sons. This vindication has been occasioned, as is\r\nstated in the first words of the memoir,[G] by the appearance of Mr.\r\nSpencer Walpole’s “History of England,” and is an attack on Mr. Walpole\r\nrather than on Lord Palmerston. But Mr. Walpole has founded his\r\nobjectionable assertion partly on Lord Palmerston’s words; and though we\r\nmay think ourselves entitled to declare that Lord Dalling should be made\r\naccountable for inaccuracies so published, and not the writer of an\r\nautobiography, who after nearly forty years has trusted to his memory\r\nwhen his journal failed him, still there are the written words, not\r\nintentionally false when written, but still imbued with that venom to\r\nwhich political feelings are at any rate as subject now as they were\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nThe passage in the autobiography of which complaint is made was as\r\nfollows. The period alluded to is the formation of the Cabinet by\r\nCanning on Lord Liverpool’s death, the spring, namely, of 1827. “In the\r\nmeanwhile intrigues were set on foot. George IV., who personally hated\r\nme, did not fancy me as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He wanted to have\r\nHerries in that office. There were questions about palaces and crown\r\nlands which the King was very anxious about, and he wished either to\r\nhave a creature of his own in the Exchequer, or to have the office of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer held by the First Lord, whose numerous\r\noccupations would compel him to leave details very much to George\r\nHarrison, the Secretary, and to Herries, Auditor of the Civil List.” To\r\nthis a note is appended by Lord Dalling, stating that Mr. Herries was\r\nalso Joint Secretary of the Treasury. One sees here the acrimony\r\ndisplayed by the Whig of the day in which it was written against the\r\nTory King and the Tory financier, whose party he had already left. But\r\nthe character of George IV. suffers more than that of Mr. Herries from\r\nthe words of the autobiographer. An insinuation about the “palaces and\r\ncrown lands” is no doubt made, which we surrender to the filial feelings\r\nof Sir Charles and Mr. Herries. To have heard such words quoted from the\r\nold memoirs of an old man is fairly admitted by them both not to have\r\nrequired such a measure of vindication as a book,--which is, however,\r\nquite able to justify itself by its own merits. It is their use, when\r\ntaken from Lord Dalling’s book, and applied to purposes of history, that\r\nhas caused their indignation.\r\n\r\nBut it was after this, in August and September, 1827, after Mr.\r\nCanning’s death, and when Lord Goderich was the Prime Minister elect,\r\nthat the contest with the King went on as to the appointment of Mr.\r\nHerries. Here, in lieu of the autobiography, we have Lord Palmerston’s\r\nletters, as to the actual truth of which no doubt is raised. There\r\nexisted evidently one of those insoluble knots, which have to be cut at\r\nlast by him who has the greatest power. The King did want Herries to be\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and was anxious to have as many Tories as\r\nmight be possible in the mixed Government for which he had given his\r\nauthority. “The King wants Herries to be Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nThe Whigs object to him pointedly, and Goderich wishes to have me.\r\nNeither party will give way.” That is quoted from a letter from Lord\r\nPalmerston to his brother, and it is at any rate true. It ended in the\r\nweakest man giving way, for Lord Goderich was told “to go home and take\r\ncare of himself.” The Duke became Prime Minister, with Goulburn for his\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Herries became Master of the Mint.\r\n\r\nCanning died on the 8th of August, and all these arrangements were more\r\nshort-lived than had been intended. Lord Goderich, as stated above,\r\nbecame Prime Minister, but retained his place only a few months--with no\r\neffect on Lord Palmerston’s immediate work, except that he ceased to\r\nhold the patronage of the army, the Duke of Wellington becoming again\r\nCommander-in-Chief. In our days it is presumed that the head of the army\r\nshall exercise no political power, and in no wise be guided by political\r\nexigencies. But that was not the Duke’s understanding. He had declined\r\nto serve under Mr. Canning, thus leaving the office for a while vacant.\r\nBut now that Canning was gone he was reappointed. “He comes in without\r\nany stipulations or conditions whatever,” Lord Palmerston said to his\r\nbrother; and in his autobiography he tells a story of the Duke and Lord\r\nAnglesey. Lord Anglesey, on behalf of the Government, had been sent to\r\ninvite the Duke to resume the office. “Well, gentlemen, I have done what\r\nyou sent me to do,” he said on his return. “I have brought you the Duke\r\nof Wellington’s acceptance as Commander-in-Chief, and, by God, mark my\r\nwords; as sure as you are alive he will trip up all your party before\r\nsix months are over your heads.” “But it was the King who did it,”\r\ncontinued Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1828 the Duke succeeded Lord Goderich as Prime Minister; but\r\nthough going in as a Tory, he took with him the leading members of Mr.\r\nCanning’s party, who may be regarded as the Liberals of those days,--as\r\nmen who had at any rate learned to lean towards Liberalism in the course\r\nof the training they had received. These were Lord Dudley and Ward, Mr.\r\nHuskisson, Mr. Grant, and Lord Palmerston. But more to be noted than any\r\nsuch members of the Duke’s Government was the fact that Lord Eldon was\r\nnot a member. Lord Lyndhurst was the Lord Chancellor instead of Lord\r\nEldon. Lord Lyndhurst had been Lord Chancellor under Lord Goderich and\r\nMr. Canning; but that was to have been expected. Mr. Canning had not\r\nintended to defend his country from Roman Catholic aggression; but the\r\nDuke would surely do so; and under the Duke’s leading Mr. Peel, who, as\r\nHome Secretary, would lead the House of Commons, would surely assist in\r\nsuch work. And were there not Lord Bathurst and Lord Ellenborough and\r\nMr. Goulburn in the Cabinet? Though Palmerston and Huskisson were to be\r\nthere, Lord Eldon’s hopes ran high. But the time for Lord Eldon had\r\npassed by. He was probably the last of the English Statesmen who could\r\nnot under any circumstances have been got to vote for the smallest\r\namount of political relief to a Roman Catholic. In all descriptions of\r\npoliticians of those days, we see men defined as being Catholic or the\r\nreverse, and men also sometimes are called “Protestants.” Lord Eldon was\r\nespecially a “Protestant;” as Lord Palmerston, and soon afterwards the\r\nDuke of Wellington and Peel were “Catholics.” The great political\r\nquestion of the present day was the expediency of lessening in some\r\ndegree “Catholic” disabilities. And when Cabinets were formed, men were\r\nadmitted or the reverse according to their “Catholic” proclivities. Lord\r\nPalmerston during his official career had gradually become “Catholic”;\r\nand it was well known of him now that, let him enter what Government he\r\nmight, he would do so pledged to support the Catholics.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston was now to go out of office and to remain for two years\r\nin opposition; but the circumstances of his going were of a nature to\r\nbring about a violent decision of the “Catholic” claims, though it\r\ncannot be said that he himself was in any way responsible for doing so.\r\nThere came up some dispute in the Cabinet as to the disfranchisement of\r\nEast Retford and Penryn, in the course of which Mr. Huskisson resigned.\r\nMr. Huskisson was the follower of Mr. Canning. That the Duke and Mr.\r\nHuskisson should not have been easy together in the same Cabinet we can\r\nunderstand; but we are told that Mr. Huskisson was anxious that his\r\nresignation should not be accepted. The Duke, however, was determined\r\nthat he should go, and would hear nothing of any mistake made as to the\r\nletter of resignation. “It was not a mistake,” he said; “it is not a\r\nmistake; and it shall not be a mistake.” The consequence was that with\r\nMr. Huskisson three other members resigned, Lord Dudley and Ward, Lord\r\nPalmerston, and Mr. Grant. Now Mr. Grant, who was President of the Board\r\nof Trade, was followed in that office by Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald, the\r\nmember for County Clare. The County Clare thus became vacant, and,\r\ndeclining to re-elect Mr. Fitzgerald, returned Mr. O’Connell in his\r\nplace; and thus the Roman Catholic question was forced upon the country.\r\nThe three or four gentlemen who filled the vacant places in the Duke of\r\nWellington’s Cabinet were of course Tories; and in this way a Tory\r\nGovernment, _pur et simple_, was again established. But it was not such\r\na Tory Government as that presided over by Lord Liverpool, and in which\r\nLord Eldon kept the conscience of the King.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lord Palmerston had already taken much interest in foreign\r\naffairs, and we find him explaining in his letters to his brother how\r\nstood the Portuguese affairs, and Spanish, and Austrian, and Greek, and\r\nTurkish. It is not necessary, in this short memoir, to explain how the\r\nTurkish and Egyptian fleets had been destroyed at Navarino by us and our\r\nallies, seeing that Lord Palmerston had not been concerned in the\r\nmatter. But it is pleasant to see, in looking over the details as given\r\nin his life, how anxious he already was for freedom in Portugal and in\r\nGreece, and how steadily he was opposed to Prince Metternich and\r\nAustrian obstinacy. Three or four articles of that creed, to which he\r\nwas true during his whole life, now crop up. These, we should say, were\r\nCatholic emancipation and the maintenance of English influence at home\r\nand abroad, and, above all things, the suppression of the slave trade.\r\nGreece was then fighting for the possession of herself, and Lord\r\nPalmerston was eager that we should take her part. He was as strongly\r\nopposed to Turkey in oppressing Greece as he was eager afterwards in\r\ndefending Turkey from Russian oppression. But in all these matters he\r\nspoke and wrote with an evident desire that England should be supreme;\r\nand, though he was no more concerned in them than as one of an entire\r\nCabinet which was concerned, he was forming that character in which we\r\nfind it difficult to say whether he was hereafter most to be blamed as a\r\nbully or to be praised as a patriot. Had he brought England into\r\ndisgrace or suffering, or, worse still, to ruin, the question would have\r\nanswered itself. He would have gone down the valley of time nearly\r\nforgotten, and this little book would never have been written. But he\r\nplayed his game boldly, and dared to run the risk of dismissal, of\r\npersonal hatred, and perhaps of impeachment. From first to last he\r\nplayed it successfully, and has obtained the goodwill of his countrymen,\r\nhigh reputation throughout Europe, and a fame which is due rather to his\r\ncourage than his genius.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1828, Lord Palmerston was out of office for the first time since\r\nhe had become a Lord of the Admiralty in 1807. There had been twenty-one\r\nyears of it, during which he had been thoroughly used to official life,\r\nofficial habits, and official language. It must have seemed to him that\r\na man such as he was born to be in office. “It is so many years since I\r\nhave been entirely my own master,” he writes, “that I feel it quite\r\ncomical to have no tie, and to be able to dispose of my day as I like.”\r\nThen he goes on to tell how, since he had left the Duke of Wellington’s\r\nGovernment, the Duke of Clarence had been specially civil to him, and\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland specially uncivil; the two Royal brothers thus\r\nshowing the politics by which they were instigated. We also know that\r\nthe Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV., sided with the Whigs, and\r\nthat the Duke of Cumberland was the most violent of Tories. Lord\r\nPalmerston had hitherto been a Tory, but each of the Royal Dukes saw in\r\nwhat course he was about to run. “His next appearance in office,” says\r\nMr. Ashley, “was in connexion with the Whigs, and the whole of his\r\nsubsequent career was spent in sympathy and harmony with their views.”\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether this correctly describes the condition of Lord\r\nPalmerston’s feelings. He was certainly loyal to the Whigs till his\r\ngreat fight came with Lord John Russell in 1851, when Lord John\r\nquarrelled with him, and not he with Lord John. And a thorough loyalty\r\nto a party of nearly a quarter of a century’s duration may serve to make\r\na man a Whig or Tory, as far as the name goes. Lord Palmerston had,\r\nalmost by accident, fallen among the Whigs, having submitted himself to\r\nthe genius of Mr. Canning, who, though influenced by liberal ideas, was\r\nno Whig; and then, on Canning’s death, had leagued himself with\r\nHuskisson, upon whose shoulders as much of Canning’s mantle had fallen\r\nas they were able to carry. Then Palmerston had left the Duke’s\r\nGovernment because Huskisson left it, and had drifted away in a boat in\r\nwhich Charles Grant and William Lamb were with him. Thus he had joined\r\nhimself with politicians who became Whig leaders and entertained Whig\r\nprinciples. But in doing so he was made over to the Foreign Office,\r\nwhere it was necessary that his politics should be foreign politics; and\r\nduring those years of his life in which a man is most strongly imbued\r\nwith political opinions,--from forty, let us say, till sixty, though in\r\nLord Palmerston’s case the twenty years came somewhat later,--his\r\nfeelings and his opinions were British and conservative rather than\r\nliberal and expansive. He did not feel himself called upon to dispute\r\nthe measures of his colleagues, but, in accordance with the system and\r\ntheory by which he governed his own conduct, he confined himself to his\r\nown duties, and cared as little, we should say, for the Whiggery of Lord\r\nJohn Russell as for the Toryism of the Duke of Wellington and Lord\r\nLyndhurst.\r\n\r\nBut, whether Whig or Tory, he was constant in doing good in that\r\ndirection in which good done to himself must be good also to others. In\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ for July, 1828, we are told what he did on his\r\nIrish estate in the way of draining;--“In the summer of 1826, a trial of\r\nwhat might be effected in reclaiming bog was made upon Lord Palmerston’s\r\nestate. Fifty acres of bog, which contained nothing beneficial in the\r\nway of manure, were drained, and brought into a state fit for producing\r\na crop, at an expense not exceeding £7 per acre; and in four months\r\nafter the spade was put into it, says Mr. Nimmo, we had very fine\r\npotatoes, and turnips, and rape, and so on, growing there as good as on\r\nany land in the world.” “We think the public in general, and the landed\r\nproprietors of Ireland in particular, are deeply indebted to Lord\r\nPalmerston for the experiment which he has made,” says the reviewer. In\r\nthese present days (1882) we can hardly venture to express a hope of the\r\nadvantage which may accrue from such work to an Irish landlord; but such\r\ngood when done is done for every one, whether to an owner of the soil or\r\nto another, and to Lord Palmerston the idea was rather that of\r\nmultiplying the produce of the earth, than of an immediate increase to\r\nhis own income.\r\n\r\nWe find from the autobiography how intent he was on the abolition of\r\nslavery in all parts of the earth, to which his own influence could be\r\nmade to extend. The sale of Greek slaves by the Turks had been\r\nabominable. Men, women, and children had been abducted and sold. It was\r\nprobably by the horrors which had been so occasioned, and which had been\r\nbrought under his notice as Secretary at War, that this strong feeling\r\nwas created; but it remained with him through his life; and, as\r\nWilberforce and Buxton had been strong in speech to cause great things\r\nto be done, so was he constant in action to cause the perpetual doing of\r\nsmaller things which in their aggregate became great. This, and the work\r\nof the Catholic emancipation,--which had begun in earnest with the Clare\r\nelection,--occupied his mind during the time that he was out of office.\r\nBut he went to Paris also during the same period, and wrote long letters\r\nhome which, interesting as they are, would be too long for our present\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1830 we hear from himself what efforts were made to\r\nstrengthen the Duke’s Government,--efforts which ultimately led to the\r\nformation of Lord Grey’s Ministry. The Duke of Wellington’s Government\r\nhad been necessarily weak since the withdrawal from it of Mr. Canning’s\r\nfollowers. Ministers had consented to the emancipation of the Catholics\r\nin 1829, and Mr. O’Connell had taken his seat for County Clare. Liberal\r\nideas and Liberal measures were creeping on, and the Duke of Wellington\r\nfelt that if he were desirous of keeping the Whigs out of office, and\r\nhimself in, he could only do so by some re-admission of Mr. Canning’s\r\nparty. He accordingly sent an offer to Lord Palmerston. Would Lord\r\nPalmerston join him?\r\n\r\nBut that other, and greater, question of Reform of Parliament was now\r\ncoming to the front. That the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel\r\nshould not have already seen how impossible it was to stop the avalanche\r\nwith such mill-dam as they were able to oppose to it is now surprising\r\nto us all. But we, looking back upon the avalanche, and what it did, can\r\njudge of its power much more accurately than could they who only heard\r\nits murmurings as it came. Wilson Croker, who was not the first\r\nmessenger from the Duke, but who appeared afterwards on the scene, put\r\nto Lord Palmerston the one vital question;--“Are you resolved, or are\r\nyou not, to vote for Parliamentary Reform?” “I am,” said Lord\r\nPalmerston. “Then,” said Croker, “there is no use in talking to you any\r\nmore on this subject.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke, finding it was so, resigned. There is nothing, I think, in\r\nLord Palmerston’s after-life to show that he himself loved the idea of\r\nParliamentary Reform. But he had joined himself with Grant and Lamb, who\r\nhad now become Lord Melbourne, and who, in truth, were now absolutely\r\nWhigs; and he had that power of foresight which enabled him to see which\r\nway the wind blew. He heard the rumblings of the avalanche, and\r\ndetermined not to be in its way when it should fall. Then Lord Grey’s\r\nGovernment was formed, and Lord Palmerston became Foreign Secretary in\r\nNovember, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON FOREIGN SECRETARY, NOVEMBER, 1830, TO NOVEMBER, 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe here begin the record of that portion of Lord Palmerston’s life which\r\nis of truth important to the English reader. In years, his life was more\r\nthan half over. He was already forty-five, and had been in office for\r\nmore than twenty years; but had he then died, he would have passed away\r\nas one of those unimportant statesmen whom, though they may do good work\r\nfor their country, it is not worth their country’s while to remember.\r\nBut though he was forty-five, Lord Palmerston’s period of importance was\r\nyet to begin, and to be continued during thirty-five additional years of\r\nuninterrupted labour.\r\n\r\nLord Dalling, in the short preface which he has prefixed to his\r\nunfinished life of Lord Palmerston, speaks as follows of the condition\r\nof England at this time in reference to the political state of Europe.\r\n“That period begins with a certain struggle against the resistance of\r\nthe northern Cabinets to any change in the affairs of Europe; and a\r\nstruggle at the same time against that reactionary spirit sprung from\r\nthe Revolution of 1830 in France, which wished to change everything.”\r\nThe writer means to imply that England was anxious to stand between the\r\ndespotism of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and the democratic\r\ntendencies of France. In this he describes accurately the position which\r\nLord Palmerston took as the exponent of English foreign politics, and\r\nwhich from the first to the last he maintained with a consistency which\r\nit has been given to few men to achieve, whose concern in the matter has\r\nlasted so long, and whose influence has been so great. Throughout his\r\ncareer it was his object to repress the personal power of the occupants\r\nof thrones; but at the same time so to repress that power as to give no\r\ninch of standing ground to demagogues. If that be true, it must be\r\nacknowledged that whether his attempts were good or evil, they were made\r\nin strict accordance with established English principles. And it will\r\nprobably be admitted by most who may read these pages, that the efforts\r\nwere good. That they were pre-eminently successful, it will be my duty\r\nto endeavour to show. That in making these efforts Lord Palmerston fell\r\ninto various errors of manner, that he was frequently led away by human\r\nfrailty, and often puffed up by pride and a spirit of personal success,\r\nis no doubt true. And it is true also that he seldom rose to any\r\nspecially exalted view of human nature. He saw all things from a\r\ncommon-sense point of view, with what we may call mundane eyes. But we\r\nare not sure that such a point of view and such eyes are not the most\r\nuseful for a British statesman. And of Lord Palmerston, it may be said\r\nthat his followers would always know what political teaching they were\r\nexpected to follow. He was not gifted with that fine insight into\r\nmatters which enables a man to discern to-day something better than what\r\nhe saw yesterday. Such still advancing improvement in sight is within\r\nthe capacity only of the highest genius. But as an English politician\r\ncan work only by the means of others, and needs many followers, the\r\nfollowers should see as quickly as he does, and if they be left in the\r\ndark they will not follow long. Lord Palmerston left none in the dark,\r\nand was therefore successful to the last by means of the true following\r\nof an attached party who always knew their man, and were sure that they\r\nnever would be led whither they did not wish to go.\r\n\r\n“As soon as Lord Grey was commissioned by the King to form an\r\nadministration, he sent for me.” These are the concluding words of that\r\nautobiography, of which mention has been made. Lord Grey sent for him,\r\nand he became Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nWriting to his brother on the 22nd of December, 1830, Lord Palmerston\r\nsays; “I’ve been ever since my appointment like a man who has been\r\nplumped into a mill race, scarcely able by all his kicking and plunging\r\nto keep his head above water.” We can understand that the kicking and\r\nplunging must have been very violent. The question had already arisen\r\nwhether Belgium should or should not be made a kingdom of itself, with a\r\nking and constitution of its own. By the Treaty of Vienna in 1815 it had\r\nbeen decreed that for certain purposes which were in themselves no doubt\r\nwise, Belgium and Holland should be one. The United Provinces would be\r\nstrong enough to form a barrier against the encroachments of France, and\r\nthe balance of power in Europe and the maintenance of liberty might be\r\nso maintained. But the governing power had been left with the Dutch, and\r\nit was felt that the Dutch had oppressed the Belgians. The King of\r\nHolland had, as a temporary measure, assumed the power of appointing the\r\njudges in the two lands, and was unwilling to abandon it. He had then\r\nbeen assisted by the judges in depriving the Press of its liberty. And\r\nthe Dutch had insisted that their language should be used in all public\r\ndocuments and all trials, although the Belgians had a language of their\r\nown, the Flemish language, and although French was the language of\r\nsociety, of the Courts and shops. And in all matters affecting religion\r\nand education, a strong bias was shown in favour of Protestant Holland\r\nover Catholic Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt can be understood that here in England feelings on this subject\r\nshould run strong, and that the entire weight of the opposition to the\r\nnew Government should be enlisted on the side of Protestant Holland. The\r\nTreaty of Vienna had been partly their work, and Lord Palmerston, who\r\nwas now the Whig Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had co-operated\r\nas Tory Secretary at War in the work which he was now anxious to\r\ndissolve. As regards the Treaty of Vienna, this division of Holland and\r\nBelgium was, no doubt, a breach of that compact; but a treaty can be\r\nonly binding when taken as a whole, and this breach of it was justified\r\nby the breach of one of its terms made by the King of Holland in\r\nassuming to himself powers which had been expressly taken out of his\r\nhands by the Treaty. This, however, was understood much less accurately\r\nby those out of office than by those in, and Lord Palmerston no doubt\r\nbecame more hot in his own defence the more he was attacked by his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nWe have his correspondence respecting the affairs of Belgium with Lord\r\nGranville, our Ambassador at Paris, and it is interesting to see how\r\nspeedily and how warmly he takes up the Belgian question. An Englishman\r\nreading this should of course remember that Lord Palmerston was an\r\nEnglish Minister, filled with English convictions at the moment, and\r\nthat he (the reader) will of course only get the English view. But the\r\nletters do leave the impression that the English Minister only wanted\r\nwhat was just; and our history tells us that his views have been carried\r\nout, and that the measure, as directed by him, has been pre-eminently\r\nsuccessful. But there is from the very first a tone of superiority in\r\nthem which, though they were addressed to our own Ambassador, must have\r\nbeen offensive to French Ministers as they trickled through to their\r\nears. Talleyrand, who was the French Ambassador in London, had asked\r\nthat, as part of the arrangement, “Luxembourg might be given to France.”\r\nBut Palmerston would not hear of it, and he then writes to Lord\r\nGranville; “It may not be amiss for you to hint, upon any fitting\r\noccasion, that though we are anxious to cultivate the best understanding\r\nwith France, and to be on terms of the most intimate friendship with\r\nher, yet that it is only on the supposition that she contents herself\r\nwith the finest territory in Europe, and does not mean to open a new\r\nchapter of encroachment and conquest.” Then we are told that, when the\r\nLuxembourg question had been given up, Talleyrand “fights like a dragon”\r\nfor two Belgian fortresses,--Philippeville and Marienburg. “We had no\r\npower,” says Palmerston, “to give what belongs to Belgium and not to us,\r\nand we could not, under the pretence of settling the quarrel between\r\nHolland and Belgium, proceed to plunder one of the parties, and that,\r\ntoo, for the benefit of one of the mediators.” Talleyrand has asked\r\nquestions about some increased force to our navy. “You may as well\r\nmention this conversation to Sebastiani, and take that opportunity of\r\nasking again about the Toulon ships. It is no harm, however, that the\r\nFrench should think that we are a little upon the alert with respect to\r\nour navy.” Then there is the question, Who shall be the new King of\r\nBelgium? as to which our Minister had at first wished that a son of the\r\nKing of Holland should be named. Louis Philippe wished that one of his\r\nsons should have the new throne. But Lord Palmerston will not hear of\r\nit. “I must say that if the choice falls on Nemours, and the King of the\r\nFrench accepts, it will be a proof that the policy of France is like an\r\ninfection clinging to the walls of the dwelling, and breaking out in\r\nevery successive occupant.” “We are reluctant even to think of war; but\r\nif ever we are to make another effort, this is a legitimate occasion;\r\nand we find we could not submit to the placing of the Duc de Nemours on\r\nthe throne of Belgium without danger to the safety, and a sacrifice of\r\nthe honour of the country.” “If they are straightforward in their\r\nintentions, why cannot they be so in their proceedings? Why such endless\r\nintrigues and plots, and such change of plans, all tending to the same\r\nobject.” Then there comes a letter, purposely written and sent in an\r\nunusual way, that it may certainly be read by Sebastiani. For it was\r\nsent through the French Foreign Office, and not by our own messengers;\r\nas to which Lord Granville observes that it will have the desired\r\neffect. “Sebastiani should really be made to understand that he must\r\nhave the goodness to keep his temper, or, when it fails him, let him go\r\nto vent his ill-humour upon some other quarter, and not bestow it upon\r\nEngland. We are not used to being accused of making people dupes.” What\r\nwas Sebastiani’s personal nature, we do not know. This may have made him\r\nkeep his temper. But it must surely have taught him to think that our\r\nMinister was very uncivil, as he of course knew well why the letter had\r\nbeen sent through the French Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nOther attempts are made by the French to get other morsels of territory\r\ninto their hands, and a strong French feeling is roused in Belgium,\r\nwhich troubles Lord Palmerston almost as much as the French overtures\r\nmade for direct French objects. A Regent, in the interests of France,\r\nwas appointed during the vacancy of the throne, of whom Palmerston\r\nrefuses to take any notice. “The greater part of our difficulties with\r\nthe Belgians have arisen from the double diplomacy, double dealing\r\ninfirmity of purpose, and want of principle in the French Government.” A\r\nM. D’Arschot is sent to England as a diplomate, but Lord Palmerston\r\nrefuses to see him officially. “I shall be happy to receive M. D’Arschot\r\nat my house as an individual; I cannot ask him to the office.” Then he\r\ngoes on. “The moment we give France a cabbage garden or a vineyard, we\r\nlose all our vantage-ground of principle; and it becomes then a mere\r\nquestion of degree or the relative value of the different things which,\r\none after the other, she will demand.” And he lays down a general\r\nprinciple, by which it will be found that he always acted. “You don’t\r\nstave off war or stop demands by yielding to urgent demands, however\r\nsmall, from fear of war. The maxim of giving way to have an easy life\r\nwill, if you follow it, lead to your having a life without a moment’s\r\nease.”\r\n\r\nAt length the question as to what king should be chosen was settled by\r\nthe election of Leopold to the throne of Belgium,--altogether with the\r\ngood-will of Palmerston, though a Dutch Prince had been his first\r\nchoice, as has been already said. But this had been done without the\r\nassent of the King of Holland; and Dutch troops marched into Belgium on\r\none side, and French troops on the other to support Belgium. The French\r\nobtained some success, and immediately there arose the renewal of French\r\nencroachments. “As to the fortresses,” says Lord Palmerston, still\r\nwriting to Lord Granville, “if they expected that we were to sign a\r\ntreaty with them for the destruction of those fortresses, I would tell\r\nhim that I would never put my hand to such a treaty, even if the\r\nGovernment agreed to it.” “One thing is certain,--the French must go out\r\nof Belgium, or we have a general war, and war in a given number of\r\ndays.” “I told him we never would agree to mix up the two questions, the\r\ndeparture of the French troops, and the question of the fortresses. I\r\nasked him whether his Government wished that people hereafter should\r\nbelieve the French Government or its word.” “I have seldom seen a\r\nstronger feeling than that of the Cabinet about the question of the\r\nfortresses.” “But let us stave off all these nibblings,” he says in\r\nreference to a demand expressed by Prussia that Philippeville and\r\nMarienburg should be given up to France. “If once these great Powers\r\nbegin to taste blood, they will never be satisfied with one bite, but\r\nwill speedily devour their victim.”\r\n\r\nAt last the Belgian question was settled, and a kingdom was formed,\r\nwhich has since remained, respected by all men, and the strongest in its\r\ncircumstances among the lesser nations of the earth. To name Belgium, is\r\nto speak of good faith and constitutional well-being. The love for it\r\nwhich England bears was strongly evinced during the German and French\r\nwar in 1870, when Bernal Osborne asked a question in the House of\r\nCommons as to the part which England would take if either party carried\r\ntheir armies over the frontier into Belgium. The French at that moment\r\nhad been driven up into a corner at Sedan, and were compelled either to\r\nsurrender or to trespass on the Belgian territory. But the question\r\nasked in the House of Commons, and the answer given, sufficed for the\r\npurpose; and no armed Frenchman and no armed German trod upon the soil\r\nwhich had become the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston had no doubt done his work well in helping the\r\narrangement. He was disinterested throughout on the part of England, and\r\nwise, and honest, and very brave. He had allowed no foreign diplomate to\r\nhoodwink him. England, looking back at his conduct, has reason to be\r\nproud of him. But there can be no doubt that he did make himself very\r\noffensive to his French colleagues in the arrangements, and took upon\r\nhimself to speak, as though he were the only honest man concerned in the\r\nwork. Whether it was essential to his purpose that he should do so must\r\nnow be a matter of opinion; but there can be no doubt that he made\r\nhimself odious to Louis Philippe and the French Ministers, who must have\r\nlooked upon him as an English bear altogether unacquainted with\r\ndiplomatic courtesies. Such I think must have been the opinion held by\r\nLouis Philippe to the end. For in these years of his life it seems to\r\nhave been Palmerston’s business to have thwarted Louis Philippe in all\r\nhis politics.\r\n\r\nBut, during the period in which the Kingdom of Belgium was being formed,\r\nthe English Reform Bill was passed, a measure of such vital importance\r\nto England as almost, in English eyes, to obliterate these first\r\nstruggles of Belgian infancy. But Lord Palmerston, true to his theory of\r\npolitical life, took but little heed of the Reform Bill. He did speak on\r\nthe subject, as it was essential that he should do so; and explained\r\nhow it had come to pass with him, as with others, that he had grown\r\nwiser as he had grown older. It was necessary that one, who had come\r\ninto power among Lord Liverpool’s Tories, should defend his vote by such\r\nan argument. But there is nothing to make us think that his heart was\r\nwith the Reformers. Indeed, as long as he remained at the Foreign Office\r\nhis heart was with foreign affairs. And though, as a member of a\r\nCabinet, he was bound to support that Cabinet’s measures, I should doubt\r\nwhether he asked many questions on the subject. His heart was then in\r\nBelgium, and in the Quadruple Alliance for establishing free\r\ninstitutions in Spain and Portugal, and afterwards in creating the\r\nkingdom of Greece, and in endeavouring to stop the abominable iniquities\r\nof Louis Philippe in reference to the Spanish marriages. But he\r\nsupported the Reform Bill, and in consequence of his doing so,--or in\r\nconsequence, rather, of his belonging to a Whig Ministry,--he lost his\r\nseat for the University of Cambridge, and, at the general election 1832,\r\nwas returned to Parliament by South Hampshire, his own county.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the pride which Lord Palmerston took in the\r\nQuadruple Alliance. The Quadruple Alliance was a compact made between\r\nEngland, France, Spain, and Portugal, for preserving the thrones of\r\nSpain and Portugal on behalf of Isabella and Maria, and defending the\r\ntwo Princesses from the machinations of their uncles, Don Carlos and Don\r\nMiguel. That the two Princesses were the legitimate heirs to the thrones\r\nneed not now, specially in England, be more than stated. But the\r\ncollateral object was to ensure freedom under the rule of the two\r\nQueens, instead of despotism, with all its bitterness, under the two\r\nKings. That at least was Lord Palmerston’s object; though, when we come\r\nto the story of the Spanish marriages, we shall find that Louis Philippe\r\nhad a further object of his own. For some account of the kind of misery\r\nto be looked for under Don Miguel, to whom Palmerston was specially\r\nhostile, I may refer my readers to an article in the _Edinburgh Review_\r\nof September, 1831, on the condition of Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn looking back at Lord Palmerston’s career, and the entire success of\r\nhis political life, we have to own that it was due to the teaching, or\r\nrather to the genius, of Mr. Canning. He had fallen into Mr. Canning’s\r\nhands, and though without that fine intellect which would have enabled\r\nhim to imitate the lessons which he had so learned, he was quick enough\r\nto perceive their merit, and wise enough to follow them, whether he were\r\ncalled Whig or Tory. Canning died, and in carrying out his lessons\r\nPalmerston had become a member of Lord Grey’s Cabinet. It was not much\r\nto him whether men called him Whig or Tory. But he saw the wisdom of\r\ngoing still on; and whether he were Member for the University which\r\ndemanded a Tory to represent it, or for his own county, which afterwards\r\nin turn again repudiated him, or for the borough of Tiverton, where he\r\ncould be one or the other, he remained always true to the precepts of\r\nthe school which he had adopted. “A Tory Government,” he says, writing\r\nto his brother, in June, 1833, “is an utter impossibility in the present\r\nstate of the public feeling; the country would not stand it.” Then he\r\ngoes on to speak of what he and the Cabinet had just done for the\r\nabolition of slavery. “To be sure, we give the West Indians a tolerably\r\ngood compensation. I really believe that the twenty millions which are\r\nto be voted for them are about the whole value of all the estates at\r\nthe present market price; so that they will receive nearly the value of\r\ntheir estates, and keep their estates into the bargain. I must say it is\r\na splendid instance of generosity and justice, unexampled in the history\r\nof the world, to see a nation (for it is the national will, and not\r\nmerely the resolve of the Government or the Parliament) emancipate seven\r\nhundred and fifty thousand slaves, and pay twenty millions sterling to\r\ntheir owners as compensation for the loss they will sustain. People\r\nsometimes are greatly generous at the expense of others, but it is not\r\noften that men are found to pay so high a price for the luxury of doing\r\na noble action.”\r\n\r\n“Some persons on the Continent want to have it supposed that the English\r\nare so bent upon economy and retrenchment that no provocation or injury\r\nwould rouse them to incur the expense of another war. This vote of so\r\nlarge a sum for the satisfaction of a principle ought to show those\r\npersons that it would not be safe to rely too much upon their\r\ncalculation.” In this he takes great pride to himself; but it is a pride\r\nin the glory of his country; and it is exhibited in private letters in\r\nwhich an absence of reticence is not unbecoming.\r\n\r\nSome time previous to this he had shown the same determined spirit.\r\nWriting to our Minister in Spain in March, 1831, he says, “It is well\r\nknown that every river on the coast of Africa, where slaves are\r\nobtained, still swarms with slave ships, bearing openly the flag of\r\nSpain; while vessel after vessel sails for that coast from the Havannah,\r\nreturns laden with these slaves, of whom even the number on board is\r\nprobably known, lands them unmolested at the back of the island of Cuba,\r\nre-enters the port of the Havannah in ballast, and is again fitted up,\r\nrapidly and without impediment, for a fresh expedition in this\r\nprohibited traffic.”\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the Slave Commissioner, at Sierra Leone, writes to him on the\r\nsubject. “The traffic under the Portuguese flag, which for years past\r\nhad been almost unheard of, appears now to be carried on to as great an\r\nextent as it was before Brazil ceased to belong to Portugal.” In the\r\nsame year Mr. Macleay, our British Commissioner at the Havannah,\r\ncomplains to him on the same subject,--of the trade as carried on under\r\nthe new Captain-General of Cuba. From this we may see that our Foreign\r\nMinister found ample matters on which to write to the servants of other\r\nCrowns so as to make himself enemies. It is not to be doubted but that\r\nhe did write with all the pertinacity of purpose which is apt to be\r\nodious to people who entertain opinions opposed to those who exercise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe above references have been taken from the _Quarterly Review_ of\r\nDecember, 1835. If we turn to the July number of the _Edinburgh Review_\r\nfor 1836, we shall find him and the slave trade spoken of in the same\r\nspirit; but the tone is so hearty that I will venture to quote the\r\npassage:--“Every Power in Europe has acknowledged that a solemn\r\nobligation is upon them to contribute to the abolition of the accursed\r\ntraffic in our fellow creatures. Each also admits that their formal\r\ndeclaration to that effect, made more than twenty years ago, has to this\r\nhour been fruitless, and the pledges then given to use every means in\r\nthe power of each to effect it, still unredeemed. The frivolous pretexts\r\nwhich have been advanced by some for not adopting the only means which\r\nexperience has shown to be effectual, require only to be refuted, and\r\nthe object to be sincerely and heartily pursued by us, and complete\r\nsuccess cannot be far distant. We have abundant evidence before us that\r\nno exertions will be wanting on the part of Lord Palmerston. His urgent\r\nremonstrances and representations have been poured into every country of\r\nthe civilized world. His tone has been firm and decisive when our slave\r\ntreaties have been infringed. He has used argument and persuasion where\r\nas yet there had been no obligation. After a careful perusal of the\r\ndocuments before us, we hesitate not to say that his zealous,\r\nconsistent, and able advocacy of this great cause, while it tends to\r\nraise his country high among nations for enlightened humanity and for\r\nmoral worth, will constitute, next to the preservation of peace, his\r\nworthiest title to a lasting reputation.”\r\n\r\nHis work is incessant, and he can hardly allow himself a few days of\r\nholiday when the Session is over. “I may then manage to get down to\r\nBroadlands for a week, and I long for a little rest.” At the end of the\r\nyear he joins a shooting party, but is not able “to get out of town for\r\nmore than four days at a time. I had three days shooting at Woburn last\r\nweek, and pretty good sport. An official party, Grey, Brougham,\r\nLansdowne (now combatants), Althorp, Melbourne, Ripon, Graham, John\r\nRussell, Auckland, Ellice, myself, young Ellice and Lord Charles\r\nRussell, were the sharpshooters.” We see from the names above given,\r\nthat he had now fallen entirely among the Whigs; for Sir James Graham\r\nwas then a Whig. “I must say that this reformed House of Commons is\r\ngrowing to be wonderfully like its predecessors; impatient of fools,\r\nintolerant of blackguards.” It is much the same thing at present, though\r\nnow the blackguards have to be tolerated. Then he speaks exultingly of\r\nthe Quadruple Alliance between England, France, Spain and Portugal for\r\nthe expulsion of Carlos and Miguel. He speaks almost boastingly of his\r\nown power. “I carried it through the Cabinet by a _coup de main_, taking\r\nthem by surprise, and not leaving them time to make objections.” This is\r\nthe spirit in which he looks at all his own doings as Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, and though we may be angry at the boasting, we cannot\r\nbut acknowledge that it was this spirit which kept him up. Then we have\r\nhim for a week down in Hampshire among his race-horses. But his papers\r\nfollow him. “I was a week at Broadlands entirely by myself, working all\r\nday, and almost every day, at F. O. boxes and Holmes’s accounts for the\r\nlast three years, which I had not before been able to look at; they were\r\nall right, however.” After this he tells us of that wicked Thresher who\r\nonly provided sixteen pheasants for five guns to kill in Yew Tree. After\r\nthat he speaks again of the Quadruple Alliance, and again exults. “This\r\ntreaty was a capital hit, and all my own doing.” Mr. Ashley, however,\r\nadds that “this treaty was a full completion of Mr. Canning’s policy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY, APRIL, 1835, TO AUGUST, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Lord Grey abandoned the Government in 1834, and why he refused to\r\ncome back again either in 1834 or in 1835, is a question in English\r\npolitics which it is difficult to answer. That it was occasioned, as\r\nLord Palmerston says, by Mr. O’Connell and the Irish Coercion Act may be\r\ntrue; but why it should have been occasioned thereby is another\r\nquestion. In the summer of 1834 the Government went out with Lord Grey\r\nat its head, and came back with Lord Melbourne instead of Lord Grey. The\r\nworld was astonished when it saw how good a Prime Minister it had in\r\nLord Melbourne, and how sufficiently clever he was for all the purposes\r\nof his position; and the old-fashioned world has hardly yet got over its\r\nastonishment as it looks back on the strong and adequate conduct of\r\nWilliam Lamb in that position. In July, 1834, the King chose him for the\r\noffice, and Lord Palmerston, of course, remained with him. But in\r\nNovember, 1834, the Tories came in. “We are all out,” says Lord\r\nPalmerston to his brother. “Turned out neck and crop. Wellington is\r\nPrime Minister, and we give up the seals, etc., to-morrow at St. James’s\r\nat two. I am told Ellenborough succeeds me. The Speaker takes the Home\r\nOffice, _ad interim_, and till Peel returns from Italy.” Then he adds,\r\n“This attempt to re-install the Tories cannot possibly last. The country\r\nwill not stand it. The House of Commons will not bear it.”\r\n\r\nThis change had been brought about by the death of Lord Spencer, whose\r\neldest son, Lord Althorp, became a peer, and could no longer lead the\r\nHouse of Commons. There was a project to make Lord Palmerston leader,\r\nand it was a position for which he afterwards proved himself to be\r\npre-eminently fitted. But King William took advantage of the accident of\r\nLord Althorp’s peerage, and was carried by his royal instincts into the\r\narms of the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. This King has always\r\nborne the character of being a true Liberal. The Reform Bill was passed\r\nin his days, and a Tory minister and Tory principles were for a time\r\nimpossible. But for a few months, when Lord Grey had gone, and Lord\r\nAlthorp had been removed from the House of Commons, he went back to\r\nToryism, as it was surely natural that a king should do. But here must\r\nbe given an extract from a kindly letter which the King wrote to Lord\r\nPalmerston on his leaving office, which is inserted for the purpose of\r\nshowing that though the Foreign Secretary had no doubt made himself\r\ndisagreeable to the King of the French and to his servants, he had\r\ncontrived to make himself pleasant to his own sovereign. “His Majesty\r\nhas, at all times, derived satisfaction from the free and unreserved\r\ncharacter of Viscount Palmerston’s official intercourse with him, and\r\nfrom the anxiety which he has shown to afford to him upon every matter\r\nthe most ample information, and all the explanation which he could\r\npossibly require, and His Majesty assures Lord Palmerston that he will\r\nalways take a constant interest in his welfare and happiness.\r\n\r\nRIGHT\r\n“WILLIAM R.”\r\n\r\nBut though the Tories were strong in hope, and Sir Robert Peel had\r\nhurried back from Italy very fast,--but hardly fast enough to satisfy\r\nthe longings of his party,--they were not destined to remain in power.\r\nOn April 21, 1835, he once more writes to his brother from the Foreign\r\nOffice, “Here I am again at my old work.” But at the general election he\r\nhad lost his seat for South Hampshire, the county having a county’s\r\ndislike to a Whig member. Lord Palmerston had, however, found a seat at\r\nTiverton, which he kept till he died. We are told that at this period he\r\nnearly slipped out of official life, having in truth but few strong ties\r\nby which he was bound to other men. Some asked themselves the question,\r\nwhy was he there,--he who had so lately been a Tory, and had done so\r\nlittle for his adopted party? For his work had been office work,\r\ndiplomatic work, silent work, done by the pen rather than by the tongue,\r\nand had not recommended itself to the Radicals. The Foreign Office was a\r\nplace of great power, and very desirable. Why should it not be given to\r\nsome man who had made himself hot with the heat of the battle of Reform?\r\nAnd when the time came that he was without a seat it might have been\r\neasy to pass him over. He did not belong to any great Whig ducal house,\r\nnor had he put himself forward as a popular speaker. But he had his eyes\r\nwide open, and knew well how to say a word in season. And he selected\r\nhis special friends with judgment. Lord Melbourne was his friend, and\r\nLord Melbourne reinstated him at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nOn his reappointment, he expressed an opinion to his brother, the truth\r\nof which every Englishman will feel. “The truth is that English\r\ninterests continue the same, let who will be in office, and that upon\r\nleading principles and great measures men of both sides, when they come\r\nto act dispassionately and with responsibility upon them, will be found\r\nacting very much alike.” The meaning of this is that an English\r\nstatesman cannot dare to be other than honest. The right thing to do\r\nmust be the right thing, whether Lord Aberdeen or Lord Palmerston be in\r\npower. When some vital question comes up as to the spreading or\r\nconfining the British Empire in India, and adding a new nation to our\r\nresponsibilities, then there may be a difference in policy, and one set\r\nof Ministers may fail to carry out the projects of their predecessors.\r\nBut in the ordinary affairs of European politics, in which clear-seeing\r\neyes may certainly discern what honesty demands, Whigs and Tories,\r\nLiberals and Conservatives, will be found “acting very much alike.”\r\n\r\nIt was now that Lord Palmerston obtained the sanction of the Cabinet for\r\nthe British Legion in Spain. It was intended to assist Queen Isabella in\r\nopposing the priests and the Inquisition. It no doubt did have that\r\neffect, though it was not altogether a success, and Sir de Lacy Evans,\r\nat the head of the Legion, was so badly handled as to make the matter\r\nappear a fitting subject for a Parliamentary attack on Lord Palmerston.\r\nThis was done with great vigour and, through a debate which lasted for\r\nthree nights, it was almost doubtful which way the majority might\r\ndecide. Towards the end of it Lord Palmerston spoke, and proved that the\r\nsilence which was usual to him did not come from want of capacity to\r\nspeak, or want of fire in speaking when the subject seemed to justify\r\nit. The speech is thus described by Mr. Edward Ellice; “It is, however,\r\nuseless to say any more of it than that Palmerston has made so admirable\r\na speech in every respect as completely to have gained the House, and to\r\nhave re-established himself entirely in their good opinion, if there was\r\na question of his having lost it in some quarters. He spoke for three\r\nhours; and I never heard a more able, vigorous, or successful defence of\r\nthe foreign policy of a Government, or war better or more happily and\r\nfearlessly carried into the enemy’s quarters.” And we are told that the\r\nHouse was riotous with cheering throughout. When it divided, however,\r\nthere was a majority of no more than thirty-six among five hundred and\r\ntwenty members.\r\n\r\nIn reading the letters from Lord Palmerston to his brother and to Lord\r\nGranville, we cannot but feel sometimes that they were written with a\r\nview to the public. They contain sententious morsels of didactic wisdom,\r\nwhich would not have not been put there in the hurry of private\r\ncorrespondence unless they had been intended for other eyes. “When two\r\nof the most powerful maritime nations accept us as mediators upon a\r\npoint of national honour, it is clear that they must think that we have\r\nnot forfeited our own.” “England,” he says, “is to be as full of\r\nrailways as a ploughed field is of furrows, but the crop they will bear\r\nis more doubtful.” “The nobles both in Spain and Portugal are the most\r\nincapable part of the nation, and therefore a remodelling of the Upper\r\nChambers in both countries seems a reasonable thing.” “No empire is\r\nlikely to fall to pieces if left to itself, and if no kind neighbours\r\nforcibly tear it to pieces.” “Half the wrong conclusions at which\r\nmankind arrive are leached by the abuse of metaphors.” And we do not\r\nalways feel that he is right. He gets a little out of his element when\r\nhe attempts to draw the conclusions at which he arrives. But when he\r\ntells of a fact, and of his conclusion from that, he is always correct.\r\nIn reference to the King’s speech in January, 1837, he says: “On Foreign\r\naffairs we shall say little, and especially not a word about France or\r\nFrench Alliance. We can say nothing in their praise, and therefore\r\nsilence is the most complimentary thing we can bestow upon them.” At\r\nthis period we certainly could have said nothing complimentary\r\nrespecting France, as the Spanish marriages were coming on, and the\r\npreparations for the Spanish marriages were being made.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 King William died, and the present Sovereign came to the throne.\r\nShe was then but eighteen years old, but immediately showed her fitness\r\nfor her high office. “The Queen went through her task to-day with great\r\ndignity and self-possession,” Lord Palmerston says, writing to Lord\r\nGranville. “One saw she felt much inward emotion; but it was fully\r\ncontrolled. Her articulation was peculiarly good; her voice remarkably\r\npleasing.” “They,” the foreign Ministers, “were introduced one by one.\r\nNothing could be better than her manner of receiving them; it is easy,\r\nand dignified, and gracious.” “There will be lots of extra ambassadors,\r\nand shoals of princes, at our coronation. Heaven knows what we shall do\r\nwith them, or how and where they will find lodging. They will be\r\ndisappointed, both as to the effect they will themselves produce, and as\r\nto the splendour of the ceremony they come to witness. State coaches,\r\nfine liveries, and gilt harness make no sensation in London, except\r\namong coachmakers and stablemen.” And then he adds: “I do not think that\r\nmarriage has yet entered the Queen’s head; perhaps some of her visitors\r\nmay inspire her with the idea; but after being used to agreeable and\r\nwell-informed Englishmen, I fear she will not find a foreign prince to\r\nher liking.” As to the foreign prince, however, Palmerston proved\r\nhimself to have been absolutely wrong.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 and 1839 Mehemet Ali was a great man. He had obtained for\r\nhimself the Pashalic of Egypt and the Dominion of Syria. Not content\r\nwith that, he desired further influence in European Turkey; and had\r\nprobably conceived in his brain the idea of first upsetting, and then\r\noccupying the throne of the Sultan. Though in this he would not have\r\nsucceeded, as the powers were too strong for him, he would probably have\r\nenabled the Emperor of Russia to have taken possession of\r\nConstantinople, as the protector of the Turk, but for the zeal and\r\nreadiness of the English. It must not be told here how Sir Charles\r\nNapier,--Don Carlos de Ponza, as Lord Palmerston called him,--put an end\r\nto this dream by taking first Sidon, and then Acre, and created that\r\nenthusiasm in the mind of Palmerston which afterwards led to the\r\nunfortunate dinner at the Reform Club, to the taking of Bomarsund in\r\nlieu of Cronstadt, and resulted at last in the bitterness of the\r\nAdmiral’s parliamentary attacks on his old friends when the Crimean war\r\nwas over. It is useless now to look back and to suggest what would have\r\nhappened had things been allowed to take another course. But if Russia\r\nhad then been the protector of Turkey instead of England, the latter\r\ncampaign, if fought at all, would have taken place nearer to the more\r\nhospitable regions of Middle Europe than the Crimea. As it was, Mehemet\r\nAli was stopped, and Turkey was defended, and Russia for awhile kept in\r\nits place, I must not say by the zeal of Lord Palmerston,--because it\r\nwould be going too far to give to him the entire credit of doing what\r\nEngland did,--but with his co-operation and in conformity with his\r\ncouncils. It was at the time presumed that Mehemet Ali was struggling\r\nfor supreme power, in conformity with French tactics; or, in other\r\nwords, that France was seeking to obtain the upper hand in Egypt. We\r\nwere then awake to the necessity of maintaining for ourselves a way\r\nthrough Egypt to India. This we were bound to do for the preservation of\r\nour Indian Empire, and should probably have done it under any\r\ncircumstances; but Lord Palmerston took so prominent a part in the\r\nmatter that it is necessary to follow him in his eagerness for a few\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThere were three parties with whom he had to carry on the contest; and\r\namong the three the first was that which occasioned him the least\r\ntrouble. They were Mehemet Ali himself, the King of the French, and the\r\nopposing members of our own Cabinet. It was comparatively easy to\r\ndispose of Mehemet Ali, with the assistance of Sir Charles Napier; but\r\nLouis Philippe was an antagonist with whom it was much more difficult to\r\ndeal. Palmerston put no trust in Louis Philippe, regarding him from\r\nfirst to last as an enemy to English practices and English aspirations;\r\nbut neither was he afraid of Louis Philippe and his Minister. He was\r\nafraid of some among his own colleagues, who could only with great\r\ndifficulty be got to act with him in opposition to French counsels. He\r\nwrites as follows to Lord Granville; “Let the French say what they like,\r\nthey cannot go to war with the four Powers in support of Mehemet Ali.\r\nWould they hazard a naval war for such an object? Where are they to find\r\nships to equal or to contend with the British navy alone, leaving out\r\nthe Russian navy, which in such case would join us? What would become\r\nof Algiers if they were at war with a Power superior to France at sea?\r\nWould they risk a Continental war? And for what? Could they help Mehemet\r\nAli by marching to the Rhine? And would they not be driven back as fast\r\nas they went? It is impossible. The French may talk big, but they cannot\r\nmake war for such a cause. It would be very unwise to underrate the\r\nforce of France and the evils of a war with her in a case in which she\r\nhad national interest and a just cause; but it would be equally\r\ninexpedient to be daunted by big words and empty vapouring in a case in\r\nwhich a calm view of things ought to convince one that France alone\r\nwould be the sufferer by a war hastily, capriciously, and unjustly\r\nundertaken by herself.” Thiers and Guizot were at this time the chief\r\nadvisers of Louis Philippe, M. Guizot having become the French\r\nAmbassador in London. But Lord Palmerston believed not much in any of\r\nthe three. “The truth is,” he says, “however reluctantly one may avow\r\nthe conviction, that Louis Philippe is a man in whom no solid trust can\r\nbe reposed. However, there he is, and we call him our ally; only we\r\nought to be enlightened by experience and not to attach to his\r\nassertions or professions any greater value than really belongs to them;\r\nmore especially when, as in the case of Egypt, his words are not only at\r\nvariance with his conduct, but even inconsistent with each other. The\r\nCabinet have determined that we must without delay bring the French to a\r\nclear and definite arrangement about their fleet.” Austria, Prussia, and\r\nRussia were willing to act with us, but were not willing to take a part\r\nso active as that which Palmerston desired on the part of England.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary to act in co-operation with these Powers, and it\r\nwas found very difficult to obtain the accord of the entire British\r\nCabinet. In consequence of this we find him writing to Lord Melbourne on\r\nthe 5th of July, 1840, and offering to resign his post “The difference\r\nof opinion which seems to exist between myself and some members of the\r\nCabinet upon the Turkish question, has led me, upon full consideration,\r\nto the conviction that it is a duty which I owe to myself and to my\r\ncolleagues to relieve you and others from the necessity of deciding\r\nbetween my views and those of other members of the Cabinet on these\r\nmatters, by placing, as I now do, my office at your disposal. My opinion\r\nupon this question is distinct and unqualified. I think that the object\r\nto be attained is of the utmost importance for the interests of England,\r\nfor the preservation of the balance of power, and for the maintenance of\r\npeace in Europe. I find the three Powers entirely prepared to concur in\r\nthe views which I entertain on this matter if these views should be the\r\nviews of the British Government. I can feel no doubt that the four\r\nPowers, acting in union with, and in support of the Sultan, are\r\nperfectly able to carry those views into effect; and I think that the\r\ncommercial and political interests of Great Britain, the honour and\r\ndignity of the country, good faith towards the Sultan, and sound views\r\nof European policy, all require that we should adopt such a course. If\r\nwe draw back, and shrink from a co-operation with Austria, Russia, and\r\nPrussia in this matter, because France stands aloof and will not join,\r\nwe shall place this country in the degraded position of being held in\r\nleading-strings by France, and shall virtually acknowledge that, even\r\nwhen supported by the other three Powers of the Continent, we dare\r\nembark in no system of policy in opposition to the will of France, and\r\nconsider her positive concurrence as a necessary condition for our\r\naction. The ultimate results of such a decision will be the practical\r\ndivision of the Turkish Empire into two separate and independent states,\r\nwhereof one will be the dependency of France, and the other a satellite\r\nof Russia; and in both of which our political influence will be\r\nannulled, and our commercial interests will be sacrificed; and this\r\ndismemberment will inevitably give rise to local struggles and conflicts\r\nwhich will involve the Powers of Europe in most serious disputes.”\r\n“Twice my opinion on these affairs has been overruled by the Cabinet,\r\nand twice the policy which I recommended has been set aside. First, in\r\n1833, when the Sultan sent to ask our aid before Mehemet Ali had made\r\nany material progress in Syria, and when Russia expressed her wish that\r\nwe should assist the Sultan,--saying, however, that if we did not, she\r\nwould. Secondly, in 1835, when France was ready to have united with us\r\nin a treaty with the Sultan for the maintenance of the integrity of his\r\nempire.” “We have now arrived at a third crisis, when the resolution of\r\nthe British Cabinet will exercise a deciding influence upon future\r\nevents; but this time the danger is more apparent and undisguised, and\r\nthe remedy is more complete and within our reach. The matter to be dealt\r\nwith belongs to my department, and I should be held in a peculiar degree\r\npersonally responsible for the consequences of any course which I might\r\nundertake to conduct. I am sure, therefore, that you cannot wonder that\r\nI should decline to be the instrument for carrying out a policy which I\r\ndisapprove, and that I should consequently take the step which I have\r\nstated in the beginning of this letter.”\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne, however, induced him to withdraw his resignation,\r\nassuring him that it would involve the dissolution of the Government.\r\n“And,” he added, “how another is to be formed in the present state of\r\nparties and opinions I see not.” The Cabinet yielded, and Lord\r\nPalmerston had his way, as he usually did have, by a singular mixture of\r\nundaunted pluck and rectitude of purpose. I do not venture to assert\r\nthat in this Turkish question Lord Palmerston did that which the welfare\r\nof the East of Europe certainly demanded. It is useless now to think\r\nwhether the Bulgarian horrors might have been avoided in 1876 had not\r\nLord Palmerston supported the Sultan in 1840, as it is also to argue\r\nthat England could not have maintained her power in Europe and her hold\r\nover Egypt had she not then supported Turkey. Considerations of matters\r\nso intricate are too difficult for a little book such as this, however\r\nfitting they may be for deeper and longer volumes. My business is here\r\nto explain the nature of the conduct and character of Lord Palmerston.\r\nAnd when I speak of his rectitude of purpose I allude rather to his\r\nmotives than to his actions. To do the best he could for English\r\ninterests, and to do that best in an honest and manly manner, was his\r\nobject; and the world may therefore give him credit for rectitude of\r\npurpose. The world must give him credit also for positive success.\r\n\r\nJust when Palmerston was offering to resign his seat in the Cabinet,\r\nmeaning to show thereby that his power of carrying his own views in the\r\nGovernment was not to be contested seriously, though questions\r\nconcerning it might be raised, a whole series of pamphlets appeared\r\nagainst him, in which he was accused of selling his own country to\r\nRussia. These charges came chiefly from one Mr. Urquhart, who had been\r\nput into the Civil Service by Lord Palmerston himself, and had since\r\nfilled himself with an idea that his former employer had become false to\r\nhis country. Mr. Urquhart’s furor was so like madness that it would not\r\nbe here mentioned, were it not worth our while to spend a page in\r\nshowing the kind of things which were published at the time. There was a\r\nMr. Doubleday, who, at a meeting at Newcastle, spoke as follows;--“I\r\nhereby declare my conviction that Lord Palmerston is a traitor, and\r\nought to be impeached; and, if found guilty before a tribunal of his\r\ncountry, his head ought to roll upon the scaffold!” “I happen to know\r\nthat this man was, a few years ago, as poor as a person called a lord\r\ncould well be conceived to be,--that he was hunted about, and had half a\r\ndozen executions in his house at once,--and now, without any visible\r\ncause, without any visible means of making a better livelihood, this man\r\nhas suddenly become rich, has paid all his debts, and is living upon the\r\nfat of the land. What rational conclusion can one come to but that he is\r\nenabled to do this by means of Russian gold?” For these calumnies there\r\nis not a tittle of excuse. There was not a word of truth in them. We are\r\nsometimes inclined to think that bitterness of speech against public men\r\nhas now attained a worse acrimony than it ever did. But when we look\r\nback at some of these speeches against Lord Palmerston, we shall see\r\nthat it is not so.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, an accusation had been made against Lord Palmerston, alleging\r\nthat in dealing with foreign affairs he was too ready to sacrifice\r\nBritish interests, being the reverse of the medal as it was afterwards\r\nexhibited, in which he was shown as offending all foreigners by his\r\narrogance in asserting every thing British. To this latter accusation\r\nhe was probably open;--but the other was brought against him also, and\r\nthen he defended himself: “In the outset, I must deny the charge made\r\npersonally against myself, and against the Government to which I belong,\r\nof an identification with the interests of other nations. I venture to\r\nsay that never was there an Administration that paid more attention to\r\nthe commercial interests of this country. And this I will add, that much\r\nas I feel the importance of the alliance of this country with other\r\nPowers, and much as I wish to perpetuate such alliances, and to\r\nendeavour to render other nations as friendly as possible with this, I\r\nam satisfied that the interest of England is the Polar star,--the\r\nguiding principle of the conduct of the Government.” Here, no doubt, he\r\ndeclared the purpose and the practice of his life;--the practice, by\r\nadhering to which he so nearly became shipwrecked, but succeeded in\r\nobtaining that special attachment which is felt for his name among\r\nEnglishmen generally.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of July, 1840, he continued the correspondence with his\r\nbrother William, the treaty with Austria, Prussia, and Russia, for\r\nrestraining Mehemet Ali, being dated on the subsequent 15th. He gives\r\nthe particulars of the treaty which, had it been accepted by Mehemet,\r\nwould have left Syria in his hands for life. But it was not accepted,\r\nand Syria was consequently taken away by the victories of Sidon and\r\nAcre. But Lord Palmerston, in the same letter, goes on to other\r\nsubjects. The Queen had now been married, and a child is to be born.\r\n“Prince Albert is to be sole Regent during the confinement of the Queen,\r\nand if any misfortune were to happen during the minority of the heir to\r\nthe throne, or rather of the infant sovereign, there is already a Bill\r\nin force to provide for the Regency till the arrival of Ernest, if, as\r\na signal punishment for the sins of the nation, he were to come to the\r\nthrone of England.” This was Ernest, the Duke of Cumberland, as well as\r\nKing of Hanover. Then, in the easy tone of fraternal conversation, he\r\nrushes on to another matter.\r\n\r\n“My Priam filly, three-year old, out of Gallopade’s dam, has won the\r\nonly two races she has started for; one at Stockbridge, and the Queen’s\r\nPlate at Guildford; and she may win a stake this week at Southampton.”\r\n\r\nWe must here for awhile go back, before we finish the story of Mehemet\r\nAli, to two circumstances, one of which had a considerable interest\r\namong the political quidnuncs of the day, and the other a more lasting\r\ninfluence on the life of Lord Palmerston himself. In the spring of 1839\r\nthe Government was nearly beaten on the question of the Jamaica\r\nConstitution, having been supported by a majority of only five. They\r\nresigned in consequence, and Sir Robert Peel, having been desired to\r\nform a Government, broke down under the difficulties imposed upon him in\r\nreference to the ladies of the household. “They insisted on the removal\r\nof the Ladies of the Bedchamber. The Queen declared she would not submit\r\nto it; that it would be too painful and affronting to her; that those\r\nladies have no seats in Parliament; that the object in view in\r\ndismissing them was to separate her from everybody in whom she could\r\ntrust, and to surround her with political spies, if not with personal\r\nenemies.” “The Queen, alone and unadvised, stood firm against all these\r\nassaults, showed a presence of mind, a firmness, a discrimination, far\r\nbeyond her years.” “We shall, of course, stand by the Queen, and support\r\nher against this offensive condition which the Tories wanted to impose\r\nupon her, and which her youth and isolated condition ought to have\r\nprotected her from.”\r\n\r\nIn all this Lord Palmerston takes the part of his Cabinet against Sir\r\nRobert Peel’s, with all the eagerness of a partisan, and did, no doubt,\r\nfeel as he wrote. But it was thought at the time that there was much to\r\nbe said for Sir Robert’s view of the case, and that however well he\r\nmight have been able to contest political questions with a Whig Cabinet,\r\nhe could not have done so with any chance of success against the wives\r\nand sisters of Whig Ministers. The ladies, however, won the battle, and\r\nthe Whigs patched up their majority again, sufficiently to enable them\r\nto go on. The other event was the marriage of Lord Palmerston with the\r\nCountess Cowper, which took place on December 11, 1839. This lady, who\r\nhad been left a widow in June, 1837, was sister to Lord Melbourne. She\r\nimmediately took the name of her second husband, though in a rank\r\ninferior to that which she at the time enjoyed, and is still remembered\r\nas the most popular woman in London. She brought to her husband a\r\nconsiderable accession of fortune, and, among other things, Brocket\r\nHall, in Hertfordshire, which had been the seat of her brother, and in\r\nwhich he died, and in which Lord Palmerston, another Prime Minister, was\r\nfated to die also. Lord Palmerston, we may imagine, had but few things\r\nto regret in the world; but this marriage, which he did not achieve till\r\nhe had reached the ripe age of fifty-five, certainly was not one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow we must go back and finish the story of Mehemet Ali, as far as Lord\r\nPalmerston is concerned with it, and also the record of his doings as\r\nForeign Secretary up to the year 1841. All through 1840 we find him\r\ncarrying on the battle. “Guizot has looked as cross as the devil for\r\nthe last few days,” he says in one of his letters; “and, indeed, on\r\nSunday, when he dined here, he could scarcely keep up the outward\r\nappearances of civility.” And then writing still to Mr. Bulwer, who was\r\nacting as Ambassador in Paris, “If Thiers should again hold to you the\r\nlanguage of menace, however indistinctly and vaguely shadowed out, pray\r\nretort upon him to the full extent of what he may say to you; and with\r\nthat skill of language which I know you to be master of, convey to him,\r\nin the most friendly and inoffensive manner possible, that if France\r\nthrows down the gauntlet we shall not refuse to pick it up; and that if\r\nshe begins a war she will to a certainty lose her ships, colonies, and\r\ncommerce, before she sees the end of it; that her army of Algiers will\r\ncease to give her anxiety; and that Mehemet Ali will just be chucked\r\ninto the Nile.” “Really Thiers must think us wonderful simpletons to be\r\nthus bamboozled.”\r\n\r\nThe reader can tell, without any reference to Lord Palmerston’s private\r\nnotes, those despatches of which he has intended that the very spirit,\r\nif not the language, shall be made known to his French antagonist.\r\nConvey to him in the “most friendly and inoffensive manner possible that\r\nif France throws down the gauntlet we shall not refuse to pick it up!”\r\nWhat other Minister ever wrote in language made so monstrously uncivil\r\nby its mock civility? But his anger is not only against France and\r\nFrenchmen, but also against certain Englishmen whom he does not name,\r\nbut who, we are left to believe, sat in the same Cabinet with himself,\r\nor formed part of the same administration. “I must say I never in my\r\nlife was more disgusted with anything than I have been by the conduct\r\nof certain parties,--useless now to name,--in all this affair.” He is\r\nsupposed here to have alluded specially to Lord Holland, who had opposed\r\nhim in the Cabinet. Lord Holland died shortly afterwards, and then Lord\r\nPalmerston had nothing to say of him but what was good and affectionate.\r\nFurther on he writes to Lord Granville, who had returned to Paris by\r\nOctober: “Pray go to the King immediately, and say you are instructed to\r\ndeprecate in the most friendly, but at the same time the most earnest,\r\nmanner, steps which we hear are under consideration, and which, if\r\ntaken, would either make war inevitable, or at least render the\r\ncontinuation or resumption (if they have ceased) of friendly relations a\r\nmatter of the utmost difficulty.”\r\n\r\nPalmerston goes on doggedly with his projects, and does not cease to\r\nboast as to his progress. Still writing to Lord Granville, he says, on\r\n23rd October, 1840; “It is plain that we have as good as driven Mehemet\r\nAli out of the whole of Syria.” “Indeed, I have good reason to believe,\r\nby information I have received from Paris, that Mehemet has sent to\r\nThiers to beg he would make the best terms he could for him.” “Louis\r\nPhilippe seems to have held to you the same language which Flahault and\r\nGuizot held while here, namely, that it is necessary, in order to assist\r\nthe King to maintain peace and keep down the war party, that we should\r\nmake to the entreaties of the King those concessions which we have\r\nrefused to the threats of Thiers. But this is quite impossible, and you\r\ncannot too soon or too strongly explain it to all parties concerned.”\r\n“All Frenchmen want to encroach and extend their territorial possessions\r\nat the expense of other nations; and they all feel, what the _National_\r\nhas often said, that an alliance with England is a bar to such\r\nprojects.” “It is a misfortune to Europe that the national character of\r\na great and powerful people, placed in the centre of Europe, should be\r\nsuch as it is.” And on the 15th of November he says; “Rémusat has let\r\nthe cat out of the bag, by declaring that France, in protecting Mehemet\r\nAli, meant to establish a new second-rate maritime power in the\r\nMediterranean, whose fleet might unite with that of France, for the\r\npurpose of serving as a counterpoise to that of England.” And on the\r\n26th: “Mehemet is the subject of the Sultan, and nothing more, and never\r\ncan or will be anything more.” “I am very sorry to find that M. Guizot\r\nis still hankering after Mehemet Ali, and clinging to the broken-down\r\npolicy of Thiers. Pray communicate the substance of this letter to M.\r\nGuizot.” And then comes the final blast of the trumpet. “My dear\r\nGranville,--This day has brought us a flight of good news; Mehemet’s\r\nsubmission”--together with other good news from foreign parts. “The\r\ngeneral result”--and here I quote Mr. Ashley’s words--“of this long but\r\nsuccessful contest over Eastern affairs, was to produce the same respect\r\nfor the names of Palmerston and England in the East as had been already\r\nproduced in Europe. Those names were whispered in the tents of the Arabs\r\nwith fear and reverence.”\r\n\r\nBut what was felt in England as to these matters is, we should say, of\r\nhigher moment in regard to our Minister’s reputation. The outspoken\r\nwords of Englishmen are of more avail than the whisperings of Arabs. The\r\nwriters of the _Quarterly_ and the _Edinburgh_ are supposed, at any\r\nrate, to write with their eyes open. But here we find that each party\r\nfights manfully, simply on its own side. Writing in April, 1837, the\r\n_Quarterly_ thus expresses itself; “The tinkering our Constitution has\r\nundergone at the hands of Whig-Radical Ministers has certainly not\r\ntended to elevate it in the estimation of foreigners, and Lord\r\nPalmerston’s foreign policy bids fair to bring the English flag into\r\ndownright contempt from one end of Europe to the other.” So much for the\r\nTory view of the years with which we have been dealing. When we turn to\r\nthe July number of the _Edinburgh_ for 1840, we find the Whig idea of\r\nour foreign politics thus given: “It was the moral influence of the\r\npolicy of England at this period, which preserved Europe in a state of\r\ntranquillity, and maintained that equipoise on which every hope of peace\r\ndepended.” Perhaps, after all, when party feelings ran so high at\r\nhome--and still run so high--the greater dependence may be placed on the\r\nArab whisperings. No doubt a knowledge of the policy of the world at\r\nlarge is necessary to determine the respect or contempt for England\r\nwhich was felt when Lord Palmerston was at the Foreign Office. But I\r\ndoubt whether any Tory can hesitate on the matter; and my conviction is\r\nthe stronger seeing that the charge now made against Lord Palmerston is,\r\nnot that he showed a tendency to bully, but that he was so efficacious\r\nin bullying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON OUT OF OFFICE, AUGUST, 1841, TO JULY, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1845 Lord Melbourne went out of office, never to come\r\nback again, and Lord Palmerston, of course, went with him, having still\r\nbefore him twenty-four years of active official life. Lord Melbourne was\r\nonly six years his senior, but he died at Brocket Hall in 1848. Lord\r\nMelbourne and Lord Palmerston had remained together since 1827, when\r\nLord Melbourne, as William Lamb, was Secretary for Ireland. They had\r\nbeen united in a peculiar manner, each trusting the other, and believing\r\nin each other, not simply as Cabinet Ministers, but as friends whose\r\nideas in politics were the same. Though Whig statesmen, they were at\r\nheart Conservatives. They afterwards became brothers-in-law. Lord\r\nMelbourne’s name occurs again in Lord Palmerston’s letters, but it is\r\nonly in reference to the late Prime Minister’s illness. Lord Palmerston\r\nwas too intent on public life to allow him a moment in which to hark\r\nback upon what was past I think it is the case that a statesman\r\ngenerally dies out of the memory of his contemporaries very quickly.\r\nSome savour of Palmerston and Peel does remain; but almost none of\r\nMelbourne and Aberdeen. Soon there will be but little of Disraeli.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs had been in office long enough for the country, which always\r\ndesires a change after a period of four or five, or perhaps seven or\r\neight years. Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston were undoubtedly\r\npopular in the House of Commons, of which Lord John was probably a more\r\ncapable leader than any who have lived during the last half century,\r\nunless it be Lord Palmerston himself. But the Ministry had become weak,\r\nand, as Lord Palmerston said, “the Tories were anxious to turn them\r\nout.” He did not add, as he might have done, that the Whigs were as\r\nanxious to turn out the Tories whenever the Tories were in. _C’la va\r\nsans dire_, we may say of both; nor would the Liberals and Conservatives\r\nof to-day be worthy of their name unless as much could be predicated of\r\nthem. On this occasion a direct vote of want of confidence was brought,\r\nand the House was so equally divided that there was a majority of one\r\nagainst the Government. Then they dissolved Parliament, and in the new\r\nHouse the Tories had a majority of seventy-two. Upon this the Whigs, of\r\ncourse, retired.\r\n\r\nOn going out of office Palmerston seems to have been specially\r\nperturbed, because he was unable to sign, as one of the\r\nplenipotentiaries, the new Slave Trade commission. This was postponed\r\ntill it was necessary that the signature should be given by Lord\r\nAberdeen, who was his successor, and he attributes the delay to wilful\r\nspite on the part of Guizot, with whom, as will have been seen, he had\r\nbeen constantly at loggerheads. “It is very shabby of Guizot to\r\nendeavour to shirk this, in order to sign with Aberdeen a treaty which I\r\nhave been hammering at this four years.” That he should have felt this\r\nmay be natural; but the mention of the grievance as a thing to be\r\ncomplained of even to such a friend as Sir Henry Bulwer, was hardly\r\nworth his while. From the summer of 1841 to the summer of 1846 Lord\r\nPalmerston remained for five years in Opposition, and during that period\r\nwe must pass over his career somewhat quickly, because he was not a man\r\nwho seems to have taken upon himself the hot and eager work of turning\r\nout Administrations, unless when, as was subsequently the case, he had\r\nto stand up in the ring, and have one lusty round with his old friend,\r\nJohn Russell. When personally attacked, he would hit back with all his\r\nstrength, but he never seems to have felt rancour afterwards, and on the\r\noccasion to which allusion has been made, he returned almost at once\r\ninto amicable relations with his old friend.\r\n\r\nHe did, however, as soon as he was out of power, attack Lord Stanley,\r\nwho, since he had come into office, had spoken more than once on Foreign\r\naffairs, although that department was not peculiarly his own. And at\r\nthis period of his life Lord Palmerston seems to have gone back to that\r\nsystem of making premeditated speeches, which is the common lot of all\r\nleading politicians; though it was one which he had altogether refused\r\nto adopt during the years that he had been at the Foreign Office. Nor\r\nhad he complied with it while at the War Office. Now he did make his\r\nattacks, not with venom indeed, but with some sharpness. “I must say\r\nthat the noble Lord’s charge shows a great want of information on his\r\npart, as to the state of our foreign relations. It may be that the noble\r\nLord and his colleagues have been too busily occupied in their own\r\ndepartments to have leisure to ransack the archives of the Foreign\r\nOffice to know what passed in our time; but then, really, they who are\r\nso wholly uninformed ought not to make such positive assertions. But the\r\nnoble Lord’s attack upon me and my colleagues is an instance, not only\r\nof great want of information, but also of the grossest ingratitude. So\r\nfar from having left embarrassments to our successors, we have\r\nbequeathed to them facilities. Why, what have they been doing since they\r\ncame into office? They have been living upon our leavings. They have\r\nbeen subsisting upon the broken victuals which they found upon our\r\ntable. They are like a band of men who have made a forcible entrance\r\ninto a dwelling, and who sit down and carouse upon the provision they\r\nfound in the larder.” The accusation is one which has always been made,\r\nand always will be made, by progressive against stationary politicians.\r\nWe all know the story of the Tory finding the Whig bathing and running\r\naway with his clothes. Of course the Conservative wishes to prevent the\r\nLiberal from being successful, and finds that he can best do so by\r\ncarrying out the measures which the Liberal has proposed. Is there any\r\nman in England who has thought that Catholic Emancipation, Free Trade in\r\ncorn, or Reform of Parliament has been dear to the normal Tory mind?\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston made his attack on Lord Stanley in the speech above\r\nquoted. Lord Stanley treasured up the grievance; and in years to come,\r\nwhen Palmerston was back at the Foreign Office, in 1850, had his\r\nrevenge, by the studied accusation he made in the House of Lords in\r\nregard to Don Pacifico. But Don Pacifico and the circumstances of his\r\neventful career were still in the womb of time.\r\n\r\nHe at once begins life as an idle man; and tells his brother of a series\r\nof visitings, which he has made. Then he goes on to his racing. His\r\nfamous mare Ilione has come out, and he has won a stake of £1,700 with\r\nher at Newmarket;--against which, however, he acknowledges that John\r\nDay, the trainer, will send him a long bill. “Then came Holmes’\r\naccounts, which have necessarily fallen greatly into arrear.” Holmes was\r\nhis steward. He writes a word of criticism about the present Government;\r\n“The country will understand what they are, and find out the difference\r\nbetween them and us. We shall have a little comparative repose, and\r\nshall be able to attend somewhat to our own affairs.”\r\n\r\nHe is still eager about the slave trade, and very busy also in abusing\r\nGuizot “The French Government have got themselves into a nice hobble\r\nabout the Slave Trade Treaty. They cannot ratify without disgusting\r\ntheir deputies. They cannot refuse to ratify without bringing dishonour\r\nupon the Crown of France.” “All this comes from Guizot’s pitiful spite\r\ntowards me for our success in the Syrian affair.” He is said to have\r\ndeclared of himself that during his many years at the Foreign Office, no\r\nsubject was more constantly in his thoughts than the slave trade. And\r\nnow, during the period of his leisure, he dinned the matter into the\r\nears of the House of Commons. We, who are old, can remember how urgent\r\nhe was, in season and out of season, respecting the African cruisers;\r\nand how, in disregard of all criticism, he “hammered away,” as he called\r\nit, so that the world should know that the slave trade had one enemy who\r\nwould never yield. He never did yield; and though his service in the\r\ncause of free labour was not so palpable as that of Wilberforce and\r\nBuxton, who brought about the total abolition of slavery in the British\r\nColonies, he did fully as much by forcing other nations into treaties,\r\nand then watching closely to see that those treaties were maintained.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Lord Ashburton was sent to the United States with the object of\r\nestablishing by treaty a boundary between them and British America; and\r\nwhile he was there he had also entrusted to him the duty of making some\r\narrangement in reference to the Right of Search. We wanted to look for\r\nAfricans intended for the slave market. No doubt we could not do so on\r\nboard vessels belonging to nations which had not entered into treaty\r\nwith us to that effect. But we claimed the right to see whether a vessel\r\nwas in truth what she called herself. But the Americans would admit no\r\nRight of Search; and Palmerston roused himself into wrath on the\r\noccasion. “Ashburton’s treaty,” he writes, “is very discreditable to the\r\nnegotiators who concluded it, and to the Government who sanctioned it.”\r\n“Our Foreign Affairs are getting into the most miserable state, and the\r\ncountry is fast falling from the position in which we had placed it.\r\nThis Ashburton Treaty is a most disgraceful surrender to American\r\nbullying, for I cannot ever give Ashburton and the Government the credit\r\nof having been out-witted.” He has already stated that “Lord Ashburton\r\nhas, if possible, greater interest in America than in England.” This\r\nprobably was altogether incorrect. But the statement made at such a time\r\nshows the animus of the man, and the strong feeling with which he viewed\r\nanything which seemed to have a flavour of surrendering British\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, O’Connell was tried for conspiracy, and convicted by a\r\nProtestant jury, and was put into prison. He appealed to the House of\r\nLords; and there, it will not perhaps be too much to say, that the\r\nmatter was tried on its political, rather than on its legal bearings.\r\nThere were five lords, and the three who reversed the decision of the\r\nCourt below were Liberals. Palmerston continually alludes to the\r\nsubject in the letters to his brother. He speaks of the trial without\r\nany violence, and almost without the expression of an opinion. When the\r\nHouse of Lords had decided, he wrote as follows;--“The ending of the\r\nO’Connell trial has surprised us all; but the man most surprised is\r\nChief Justice Tindal, who, having given the opinion of the majority of\r\nthe judges in the House of Lords, thought the matter settled, and set\r\noff the same night for his summer excursion. Upon arriving at Frankfort,\r\nthe day before yesterday, he met Bellenden Kerr, one of our\r\nCommissioners for digesting the criminal law, who immediately made an\r\nexperiment on his legal digestion by telling him of the decision of the\r\nHouse of Lords. Tindal could hardly believe it possible. I agree with\r\nthe _Times_ that it would only be fair by O’Connell to allow him to stay\r\nin prison a few days longer, to consider what he is to do next.” But\r\nO’Connell and the trial soon died away, and in the Session of 1846 the\r\nMaynooth grant was the subject which chiefly filled the minds of\r\npoliticians. Mr. Gladstone resigned upon it, because he would not, while\r\nin office, support Sir Robert Peel’s measure. Sir Robert endeavoured to\r\nstrengthen his Cabinet by various changes, as to which Lord Palmerston\r\nmakes the following suggestions as to his own office;--“If he would but\r\nshift Aberdeen to any other less important office, and put to the\r\nForeign Office some man of more spirit, energy, and sagacity, it would\r\nbe a great gain for the country; but that seems now hopeless!”\r\n\r\nThen there came the step in English politics which Sir Robert Peel took\r\nin this Session, and by taking which he has obtained a place among the\r\nhalf-dozen greatest statesmen whom England has produced. He determined\r\nto repeal the Corn Laws altogether. “The Minister was honestly\r\nconvinced,” says Morley, in his “Life of Cobden,” “but the party was\r\nnot.” How far the intention of his purpose came from the immediate\r\nnecessity of his position,--how far, that is, we owed the repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws at that moment to the scarcity of food in Ireland,--or how far\r\nit was due to the actual conversion of the statesman’s mind to the truth\r\nof Adam Smith’s teaching, is, to my thinking, doubtful. There were yet\r\nfive years before his death, and during those five years the conversion\r\nwas completed. But the audacity with which he acted on the spur of the\r\nmoment, resolving that a people must be fed even though he might have to\r\nabandon all his old political alliances, betokened a great man; and a\r\ngreat man he will remain as long as English history is read and\r\nunderstood. The political position at the moment, and that of Lord\r\nPalmerston as a person concerned, is so well described by Mr. Ashley\r\nthat I will venture to quote his own words:--“The immediate cause of\r\nevents, however, which came so suddenly on the political world, was a\r\nscarcity of the Irish potato crop. The population of Ireland had to be\r\nprovided for; and, after two or three meetings with his Cabinet, and\r\npropositions made by him and rejected by Lord Stanley, the Prime\r\nMinister declared that he saw no satisfactory course to adopt short of\r\nthe total abolition of the Corn Laws, which it had been hitherto only\r\nproposed to modify; and the Administration broke up, Lord John Russell\r\nbeing entrusted with the construction of a new Ministry. This task,\r\nafter a short effort to fulfil it, he resigned, giving as his principal\r\nreason for not forming a Government the refusal of Lord Grey to join\r\nit.” This Lord Grey was the son of him who had refused to come back to\r\nthe Government after Lord Althorp had become a peer. “If, as it was\r\ngenerally said, Lord Grey’s refusal was because the Foreign Office was\r\nto be placed in the hands of Lord Palmerston, this would prove that all\r\nhis former colleagues were not his friends, but that he still remained\r\nmore powerful than his opponents. At all events, Sir Robert, exalted by\r\nthe thought that he had a high duty to perform, once more sacrificed his\r\npast life to what he believed the future of his country, or perhaps (to\r\nspeak more correctly) to the exigencies of the hour; and it was this\r\ndisinterested conversion of an old and experienced statesman that gave\r\nthe Manchester doctrines the unquestioned authority they have exercised\r\nfrom that time.”\r\n\r\nWhen the deed was done, the resignation of Sir Robert Peel was its only\r\npossible conclusion. Lord Stanley had already left the Ministry on the\r\nCorn Law question, and on the next important division which took place\r\nthe Government was defeated by a union of the Whigs and Tories in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Sir Robert Peel retired, never again to return to\r\noffice. Lord Palmerston sang the late Minister’s pæan in the House of\r\nCommons, and then once more returned to the Foreign Office under the\r\nleadership of Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON FOREIGN SECRETARY, JULY, 1846, TO DECEMBER, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to Lord Palmerston’s third period at the Foreign Office,\r\nwhich lasted from July, 1846, to December, 1851, but which we shall find\r\nit better to divide into three chapters than to comprise it in one,\r\nbecause it includes the romantic affair of Don Pacifico, which, by the\r\nattempts made and the success achieved, will deserve a chapter to\r\nitself. The _coup d’état_ and his dismissal will demand a third. We will\r\ntherefore take Lord Palmerston’s life at the Foreign Office down to the\r\nyear 1850, when the great Don Pacifico debate took place. There were in\r\nthe meantime various circumstances, all at the moment of intense\r\nnational interest, with which he was either specially concerned as\r\nForeign Secretary, or much concerned as a leading Cabinet Minister. The\r\nchief among these were the Spanish marriages, Lord Minto’s mission to\r\nItaly, the French Revolution and escape to England of Louis Philippe,\r\nthe first war between Austria and Sardinia, the French occupation of\r\nRome, and the wars in Hungary. With the minor operations of his official\r\nlife it is impossible for us here to deal.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to office, there had arisen a question as to the\r\nexpulsion of the Jesuits from certain Swiss cantons; but I do not know\r\nthat the English reader will care much now about the Jesuits in\r\nSwitzerland. Nor are we specially anxious as to the civil war which was\r\nthen carried on in Portugal. But the knot in European politics known as\r\nthe Spanish marriages had then an importance, and has since achieved\r\nresults, which make it necessary that we should not altogether pass it\r\nover in any record, however short, of Lord Palmerston’s life. But for\r\nthose Spanish marriages Louis Philippe’s heirs might still have sat upon\r\nthe throne of France, and the name of king would not be altogether\r\ndisgraced in the realm over which Henry IV. had ruled. No prophecy shall\r\nbe ventured upon here as to the future of the French nation; but it is,\r\nI think, notorious to the world at large that the last blow given to the\r\nBourbon family, in the opinion of Frenchmen, came from the Spanish\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\nI cannot but here remark that, strong, abiding, and consistent as was\r\nLord Palmerston’s conduct in reference to these transactions, and\r\nassuredly as the disgrace would have been prevented could it have been\r\nstaved off by our English Minister, he does not seem to speak of the\r\nfoul political arrangements which were contemplated and carried out,\r\nwith that disgust which they must have engendered in the mind of every\r\nhonest and high-minded gentleman. But here we must remember that Lord\r\nPalmerston, as English Foreign Secretary, accustomed as he was to speak\r\nhis mind freely, could not speak out quite plainly; and that of all that\r\nhe did say we probably do not possess the whole. But the consequence is\r\nthat up to this date men speak of the Spanish marriages as having been\r\ntolerable in politics though bad in morals, and as projects which should\r\nconsign the inventors to no perdition, because they dealt, not with\r\nprivate, but with public matters. To us it has seemed that the evil\r\nintended, and in a great degree consummated, was of such a nature as to\r\ndeserve all the stigma which a private iniquity could bear. The Spanish\r\nmarriages are withdrawn from the comparatively easy regions of national\r\nconscience by the intensity of private desire for aggrandisement, by the\r\nprivate nature of the precautions taken, and by the private evil\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nNow, I must tell the story with as little matter of annoyance as may be\r\npossible. It has already been told in Lord Palmerston’s life, and so\r\noften before and since, that there can be no other reason for silence\r\nbut the abomination of the tale to be told. It is, however, impossible\r\nto produce aright a memoir of Lord Palmerston’s life without telling it.\r\nWhen kings and their councillors do amiss it is by no means the least of\r\nthe evil done that their doings must be made public and explained.\r\n\r\nIt had become to be important to us and other nations that the thrones\r\nof France and Spain should be kept distinct, so that no French prince\r\nmight come to sit upon the throne of Spain. As there were now two\r\nSpanish princesses,--Isabella, who was the Queen, and her sister, who at\r\nthe moment was her heir,--Louis Philippe was required to engage, and did\r\ndistinctly bind himself, that no son of his should marry Isabella, and\r\nalso that no son of his should marry the sister till the Queen should\r\nhave become a mother. Having bound himself by this undertaking the\r\nKing’s first endeavour was, to use an English phrase, to drive a coach\r\nand horses through it. He determined that a son of his, or at any rate a\r\ngrandchild, should sit upon the throne of Spain, and presuming, as we\r\nmust surmise, that he found his opportunity in the comparative weakness\r\nof Lord Aberdeen, he set to work to make such arrangements as might be\r\npracticable. Palmerston had declared in 1836, when Isabella was about\r\nfive years old, that it would be so. “The fact is that he,”--Louis\r\nPhilippe,--“is as ambitious as Louis XIV., and wants to put one of his\r\nsons on the throne of Spain as husband to the young Queen.” But since\r\nthen the young lady had grown to what in Spain is a marriageable age,\r\nand the young Prince who was to become the link between the thrones was\r\ntwenty-two.\r\n\r\nThe King of the French did not see his way to break the engagement by\r\nrunning counter to its first clause. He could not marry his son to the\r\nyoung Queen. He might marry his son to the Queen’s sister, as soon as\r\nthat sister had a child. But that clause he did manage to break; and on\r\nthe day on which the Queen was married, the Duke de Montpensier was\r\nmarried to the Princess. This was wrong, and false, and\r\nmischievous,--likely to lead to quarrels and wars, and unlikely to lead\r\nto increased power and dominion for any king or prince. But it was a\r\ntrick within the compass of certain kings and certain ministers, and was\r\nnot unroyal in all its bearings. Louis Philippe, however, was not\r\ncontented with this. He went farther, and selected the Prince who was to\r\nmarry the Queen. There was a Prince, unfortunate, as the minds of men\r\ngo, but hitherto not disgraced,--a poor man who could never become the\r\nfather of children. He it was whom Louis Philippe selected, with the\r\nassistance and guidance of Guizot, in the absolute ignorance, I do not\r\nhesitate to say, of Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nSuch were the Spanish marriages. The fruits of them, as might have been\r\nguessed, were disastrous. The Queen, at any rate, had children, on whose\r\nroyal birth no slur was openly thrown. The Duke de Montpensier lives as\r\nan unknown nobleman in a foreign land, to whose name there clings\r\nsomething of the flavour of his father’s deeds. M. Guizot, who was the\r\ngreat Minister of the day, a man of high intellect, of thoughtful\r\nhabits, of religious feeling, and a Protestant, tarnished his name for\r\never. And Louis Philippe ran from France as an exile, taking refuge in\r\nEngland under the name of Mr. Smith. And here he died! The marriages\r\nwere perpetrated! But with what results to all who were concerned in\r\nthem! It may be doubted whether any meaner crime was ever committed in\r\nthe name of policy, or one of which the end was more befitting, or\r\nbetter deserved.\r\n\r\nThe effect which this produced in Europe took eighteen months to show\r\nitself. The marriages were solemnized in the autumn of 1846, and Louis\r\nPhilippe came to England and took up his abode at Claremont in the\r\nspring of 1848. All his fine machinations had been blown like\r\nsoap-bubbles into air! The result of the marriages upon English feeling,\r\nand upon Lord Palmerston, who was the one Englishman more concerned than\r\nothers, was that of distinct alienation. It afforded matter but for few\r\nspeeches in the House of Commons, and not much for private\r\ncorrespondence, as it was done in secret, and the wickedness of the\r\narrangements could only creep out by slow degrees. Men at the time used\r\nto whisper to each other that it was so, and men who received the\r\nwhisper declined to believe the story in all its foul enormity. Now it\r\nhas become a matter of history, and there is no ordinary reader who does\r\nnot know of what nature were the Spanish marriages. But Guizot is said\r\nat the time to have become so lost to all decent feeling, so warped and\r\nstung by the constant interference which he had received from Lord\r\nPalmerston, as to have boasted that the political arrangement made was\r\nthe one great thing which France had herself achieved, unaided, since\r\n1830!\r\n\r\nIt effected the entire break-up of the concert which had existed between\r\nthe great Powers of Europe, and clearly led to all the revolutions and\r\ndisturbances of 1848. England and France were severed, and by their\r\ndivision Austria, Prussia and Russia were encouraged to expect to have\r\ntheir way. A further appropriation of Poland was intended, and was\r\neffected; but we find Palmerston endeavouring to prevent it. He writes\r\nto Lord Normanby on the 19th of November, 1846; “I have prepared an\r\nanswer about Cracow, which I shall send off to Vienna without waiting\r\nfor Guizot.” “Guizot will make a show of resistance; but the fact is,\r\nthat, even if France and England had been on good terms, they have no\r\nmeans of action on the spot in question, and could only have prevented\r\nthe thing by a threat of war, which, however, the three Powers would\r\nhave known we should never utter for the sake of Cracow. The measure is\r\nan abominable shame, and executed by the most hollow pretences and the\r\nmost groundless assertions.”\r\n\r\nIn January, 1847, the Queen protested, in her speech from the throne,\r\nagainst this new Polish outrage. Lord Palmerston was evidently nettled\r\nto think that he could not interfere so as to prevent it. It was but\r\nanother scar on the Treaty of Vienna, and he could do nothing. Soon\r\nafterwards a French political officer of high standing had been\r\ncondemned for corruption, and had endeavoured, or pretended to\r\nendeavour, to commit suicide. “In either way, these things must be a\r\nblow to Guizot and the Philippine system.” The Philippine system was to\r\nPalmerston unutterably damnable. It was sly, fraudulent, false,\r\nextremely courteous, and thoroughly un-English. But it was secret,\r\nclever, and at this moment seemed to be triumphant. It was above all\r\nthings opposed to Palmerston. We can conceive nothing more bitter than\r\nthe hatred which at this time raged between the two statesmen. And in\r\nspeaking of it, we should by no means endeavour to wash Lord Palmerston\r\nquite white. It may have been that had the “suaviter in modo” been more\r\ncustomary with him, the “fortiter in re” might have been more apparent.\r\nBeing an older politician, and, we may say, a much wiser one, he had\r\nthought to dominate the Frenchman; but the Frenchman knew himself to\r\npossess a brighter intellect, a more brilliant style of eloquence, and,\r\nin erudition, to be the greater man. We will concede it to him,--that he\r\nwas so. But Lord Palmerston possessed two virtues by means of which his\r\nname will go down to posterity altogether unsullied. He was brave, and\r\nhe was honest.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Lord Minto’s mission to Italy, which had been, we\r\npresume, arranged between Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. Pio\r\nNono, the late Pope, had been elected in 1846, and Lord Minto started\r\nfor Italy in November, 1846. We still remember how decided was the\r\nLiberalism of the new Pope, when he first filled St. Peter’s chair,--an\r\nalmost impossible condition for a Pope, and one which he soon vacated.\r\nBut Lord Minto went to assist him in his Liberalism, to give him such\r\naid as might be possible for an English Liberal Lord, and to find out in\r\nreturn what the new pope could do for England in keeping quiet seditious\r\nIrish bishops. “You will be at Rome,” said Lord Palmerston, “not as a\r\nminister accredited to the Pope, but as an authentic organ of the\r\nBritish Government, enabled to explain its views and to declare its\r\nsentiments upon events which are now passing in Italy.” “Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment are deeply impressed with the conviction that it is wise for\r\nSovereigns and their Governments to pursue, in the administration of\r\ntheir affairs, a system of progressive improvement; to apply remedies to\r\nsuch evils as, upon examination, they may find to exist, and to\r\nre-model, from time to time, the ancient institutions of their\r\ncountry,--so as to render them more suitable to the gradual growth of\r\nintelligence, and to the increasing diffusion of political knowledge;\r\nand Her Majesty’s Government consider it to be an undeniable truth, that\r\nif an independent Sovereign, in the exercise of his deliberate judgment,\r\nshall think fit to make within his dominions such improvements in the\r\nlaws and institutions of his country as he may think conducive to the\r\nwelfare of his people, no other Government can have any right to attempt\r\nto restrain or to interfere with such an employment of one of the\r\ninherent attributes of independent sovereignty.”\r\n\r\nWe cannot but observe here the way in which Lord Palmerston lays down\r\nthe law for the governance of the nations generally. No doubt he was\r\nright in what he said; but he said it with the air of some superior\r\nbeing, whose word is to go for more than the words of other mortals.\r\nLord Minto does not go at once to Rome, but stays awhile at Turin,\r\nwhere the Austrians have shown a desire to interfere with Charles\r\nAlbert, the father of Victor Emanuel. It is to be hoped that the\r\nAmbassador Extraordinary knew the phraseology of the hunting-field as\r\nwell as did his correspondent. If so, he would understand when he was\r\ntold that, “As to the Austrians they have been headed, and will not\r\nbreak cover towards Italy.” Then Palmerston explains that, for having\r\nstopped the Austrians, the Pope ought to do him a good turn, in\r\nsilencing a meddlesome bishop or two. Alas, that an opinion so absurd\r\nshould ever have been held in regard to Pio Nono! “We wish to make the\r\nPope the plain, and simple, and reasonable request that he will exert\r\nhis authority over the Irish priesthood, to induce them to abstain from\r\nmeddling in politics, but, on the contrary, to confine themselves to\r\ntheir spiritual duties.” “I shall be able to send you by the next\r\nmessenger, a memorandum about the letter which has recently been\r\nreceived by McHale, from Rome, upon the subject of the Irish colleges.\r\nThis is an unkind and most mischievous measure, and was little to be\r\nexpected at the hands of the Pope at the very moment we were stepping\r\nout of our way to be of use to him. It is an ungrateful return.” And a\r\nlittle further on he writes to his correspondent; “You may confidently\r\nassure the Papal authorities that at present in Ireland, misconduct is\r\nthe rule, and good conduct the exception, in the Catholic priests.”\r\n\r\nOf course it would be so, human nature being the same with Roman\r\nCatholics as with Protestants. Had we paid the priests, as we paid, and\r\nstill pay, the parsons, out of the funds collected by the Government,\r\nthe priests would have worked for the Government. To expect that they\r\nshould do so under other circumstances is to dream of a Utopia. But to\r\nimagine that assistance could be got from the Pope to induce the priests\r\nto do so, was beyond any Utopian dream. There was a notion afloat at the\r\ntime that the Pope should send an ambassador to London to carry out the\r\nliberal views with which he was supposed to have been imbued. But to\r\nthis Lord Palmerston will give no assent. “As for the idea that we could\r\nmanage the Irish priests by means of a Roman priest in London, I am\r\nconvinced that the presence of such a man would only have given the\r\nIrish priests an additional means of managing us.” Lord Minto writes\r\nback word that “The Pope is a most amiable, agreeable, and honest man,\r\nand sincerely pious to boot, which is much for a Pope; but he is not\r\nmade to drive the State coach.”\r\n\r\nThe honesty and piety of Pio Nono must be judged from his whole career.\r\nCertainly Lord Minto could not teach him the political state of Europe.\r\n“As to the poor Pope,” says Lord Palmerston, writing back to Lord Minto,\r\n“I live in daily dread of some misadventure having befallen him. Events\r\nhave gone too fast for such a slow sailer as he is.” Then he speaks of\r\nthe deposition of Guizot’s ministry in Paris--for Guizot had been\r\ndeposed. “What has been happening in Italy ought to have been a warning\r\nto Guizot. What has now happened to Guizot ought to be a warning to\r\nItaly. Guizot thought that by a packed Parliament and a\r\ncorruptly-obtained majority, he could control the will of the nation,\r\nand the result has been that the will of the Crown has been controlled\r\nby an armed popular force. People have long gone on crying up Louis\r\nPhilippe as the wisest of men. I always have thought him one of the most\r\ncunning, and therefore not one of the wisest. Recent events have shown\r\nthat he must rank among the cunning, who outwit themselves; and not\r\namong the wise, who master events by foresight and prudence. This\r\nsurrender of the King of the Barricades to the commons of the National\r\nGuard is, however, a curious example of political and poetical justice.”\r\nThis was in 1848, when all Europe was on the stir. “Was there ever such\r\na scene of confusion as now prevails almost all over Europe? Fortunate,\r\nhowever, has it been for Italy that you crossed the Alps last autumn. If\r\nthe Italian sovereigns had not been urged by you to move on, while their\r\nimpatient subjects were kept back, there would by this time have been\r\nnothing but Republics from the Alps to Sicily.” Then he ventures on a\r\nprophecy which has become absolutely true in later years. “We have just\r\nheard of the entrance of Sardinian troops into Lombardy to help the\r\nMilanese. Northern Italy will henceforth be Italian, and the Austrian\r\nfrontier will be at the Tyrol. This will be no real loss to Austria.”\r\nHis dislike to Austria and Metternich is only second to his hatred for\r\nLouis Philippe and Guizot. France itself he did not hate, or even\r\ndislike--or, rather, liked as well as he could any country except\r\nEngland. He says that Austria after such losses may, if well governed,\r\nbecome a powerful State. But he adds: “The question is, Has she any men\r\ncapable of making any State a powerful one by good government.”\r\n\r\nThere had in the meantime sprung up a revolution in Sicily against\r\nNaples, and Lord Minto had gone on to Naples, and into the Sicilian\r\nwaters, attempting to put it down. But it was not put down till 1849,\r\nwhen the seditious efforts of the previous year were nearly quelled\r\nthroughout Europe. So Lord Minto returned home, having not apparently\r\ndone much, but having brought with him more correct views of the\r\nItalian people than English Ministers had hitherto possessed.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1848 there came upon France that thorough disturbance of all\r\nthings which has never yet quite rectified itself. Indeed, it may be\r\nsaid that there has been nearly a century of disturbance, during which,\r\nhowever, France has grown wonderfully in wealth and intelligence. But in\r\n1830 France had once more re-established herself, and the Citizen King\r\nwas put upon his throne as a thing of permanence and a just mixture of\r\nmonarchical principles with democratic ideas. It must be acknowledged of\r\nLouis Philippe, as also of Napoleon III., that France did grow rich\r\nunder him. But in both cases the riches came “post hoc” and not “propter\r\nhoc.” According to our thinking, neither the one ruler nor the other\r\ncould have benefited his people much, because neither of them was simple\r\nin his way of ruling. Louis Napoleon was yet to come, but Louis Philippe\r\nhad now brought himself and his administration to an end.\r\n\r\nThere had been a great demand for reforms in Paris and the King had\r\nexpressed himself strongly. “I never will consent to reform,” he had\r\nexclaimed. “Reform is another word for the advent of the Opposition.”\r\n“Tell your master not to mind having popular assemblies,” is quoted by\r\nLord Normanby as said by Louis Philippe to some foreign ambassador. “Let\r\nthem only learn to manage things as I manage mine.” The dismissal of\r\nGuizot, the Minister, was demanded among other things. Guizot had stood\r\nhigh for personal integrity;--and we believe that he was perfectly\r\nhonest; but he got into various troubles in which he consented to the\r\nexpenditure of public money to satisfy the rapacity of others; and,\r\nthough he was honest himself, he seems to have dealt easily with\r\ndishonesty in his subordinates. But Louis Philippe felt that to lose\r\nGuizot was to own himself beaten, and clung to his Minister. Then came\r\nthe proposition for a popular banquet, and the stopping of the banquet\r\nby the police, but with permission given for a procession; and then the\r\nstopping of the procession; and then the catastrophe. Louis Philippe,\r\nwith his family, ran away, and in a few days appeared as Mr. Smith on\r\nthe coast of Sussex, at Newhaven.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February Lord Palmerston thus writes to Lord Normanby;\r\n“What extraordinary and marvellous events you give me an account of. It\r\nis like the five acts of a play, and has not taken up much more time.\r\nStrange that a king who owed his crown to a revolution, brought about by\r\nroyal blindness and obstinacy, should have lost it by exactly the same\r\nmeans, and he a man who had gone through all the vicissitudes of human\r\nexistence, from the condition of a schoolmaster to the pomp of a throne;\r\nand still further that his overthrow should have been assisted by a\r\nMinister deeply read in the records of history, and whose mind was not\r\nmerely stored with the chronology of historical facts, but had extracted\r\nfrom their mass the lessons of events and the philosophy of their\r\ncauses.” And then he gives instructions as to what shall be done by the\r\nEnglish Ambassador in Paris. “Our principles of action are to\r\nacknowledge whatever rule may be established with apparent prospect of\r\npermanency, but none other.” “We will engage to prevent the rest of\r\nEurope from meddling with France, which, indeed, we are quite sure they\r\nhave no intention of doing. The French rulers must engage to prevent\r\nFrance from assailing any part of the rest of Europe.” Then he goes on\r\nto lay down rules for different emergencies. What shall be done if the\r\nRevolution endeavours to protect itself by using the army for foreign\r\nconquest? But his heart beats warmly for his own child. “We cannot sit\r\nquiet and see Belgium overrun and Antwerp become a French port.” “If\r\nthey will look to the stipulations of the treaty finally concluded\r\nbetween the five Powers, Belgium, and the Netherlands, they will see\r\nthat there are in it guarantees which would have a very awkward bearing\r\nupon any attempt by France to annex Belgium to its territory.” He\r\nexpresses his own feelings on the whole matter; “I grieve at the\r\nprospect of a Republic in France, for I fear it must lead to war in\r\nEurope and fresh agitation in England. Large Republics seem to be\r\nessentially and inherently aggressive, and the aggressions of the French\r\nwill be resisted by the rest of Europe, and that is war; while, on the\r\nother hand, the example of universal suffrage in France will set our\r\nnon-voting population agog, and will create a demand for an inconvenient\r\nextension of the franchise, ballot, and other mischievous things.\r\nHowever, for the present, ‘Vive Lamartine!’” Lamartine was the\r\nprovisional President of the New Republic, and while he remained in\r\noffice did behave with a better grace than could have been expected from\r\na man so abnormally situated.\r\n\r\n“Here is a pretty to do at Paris,” he says a few days later on in a\r\nletter to Lord Ponsonby at Vienna. “It is plain that, for the present at\r\nleast, we shall have a Republic in France. How long it may last is\r\nanother question. But for the present the only chance for tranquillity\r\nand order in France, and for peace in Europe, is to give support to\r\nLamartine. I am convinced this French Government will not be aggressive\r\nif left alone. But if the Austrian Government does not mitigate its\r\nsystem of coercion in Lombardy and grant liberal institutions, they will\r\nhave a revolt there.” Our British difficulty at the moment arose chiefly\r\nfrom the advantage endeavoured to be taken by the Irish of the French\r\nrevolutionary spirit. When all Europe was in revolt Ireland, of course,\r\nwould not remain calm. Smith O’Brien with various deputations was at\r\nonce in Paris. “I have written to you,” says Lord Palmerston to Lord\r\nNormanby, “an official despatch about M. De Lamartine’s allocutions to\r\nIrish despatches and his direct allusions therein to our internal\r\naffairs, such as Catholic Emancipation, Irish agitation, Repeal of the\r\nUnion, and other matters, with which no foreign Government had any right\r\nto meddle. I wish you to convey to him, in terms as civil as you can\r\nuse, that these speeches, and especially that to which my despatch\r\nrefers, have given great offence in this country.” It does not appear to\r\nhave occurred to him how often he himself was interfering in the foreign\r\naffairs of other countries. But Lamartine seems to have taken the\r\nobservations in good part. “Pray tell Lamartine,” he says, “how very\r\nmuch obliged we feel for his handsome and friendly conduct about the\r\nIrish deputations.”\r\n\r\nThe amount of business which fell on to his shoulders at this time may\r\nbe well imagined, and yet he was now sixty-four years old. “As to your\r\nnot always getting letters from me by every messenger who passes through\r\nParis, never wonder at that, nor think it extraordinary.” This is still\r\nto Lord Normanby. “Wonder rather when I am able to find time at all. I\r\nam sure you would if you saw the avalanches of despatches from every\r\npart of the world which come down upon me daily, and which must be read,\r\nand if you witnessed the number of interviews which I cannot avoid\r\ngiving every day of the week. Every post sends me a lamenting minister\r\nthrowing himself and his country upon England for help, which I am\r\nobliged to tell him we cannot afford him. But Belgium is a case by\r\nitself, and both France and England are bound by treaty engagements in\r\nregard to that country, which it is most desirable for the repose of\r\nFrance and England that no events should call into active operation.”\r\nThen he sends word to our Ambassador at St. Petersburg as to what may\r\nthere be expected of England in reference to certain Polish difficulties\r\nwhich have cropped up. “We, the Government, will never do anything\r\nunderhand or ungentlemanlike in these matters. I wish we could hope that\r\nthe Emperor might of his own accord settle the Polish question in some\r\nsatisfactory manner.” Then there is an allusion to the one burlesque\r\nEnglish incident which graced the Revolution. “I conclude that he”--he\r\nis Lamartine--“has escaped one danger by the refusal to naturalize\r\nBrougham; for it is evident that our ex-Chancellor meant, if he got\r\nhimself elected, to have put up for being President of the Republic.”\r\n\r\nIn 1848, as a part of the European disturbance, the Chartist rows came\r\nup in London, affording the most signal evidence that up to that time at\r\nleast the spirit of democratic enmity to order was not at work in\r\nEngland. Nor, according to such evidence as we possess, is it so\r\nnow,--though at this moment, 1882, it is rampant in Ireland. The\r\nquestion was one with which Lord Palmerston had not much immediate\r\nconcern. But, alluding to his branch of politics, he writes with his\r\nusual vivacity. “The foreigners did not show; but the constables,\r\nregular and special, had sworn to make an example of any whiskered and\r\nbearded rioters whom they might meet with, and I am convinced would have\r\nmashed them to a jelly.”\r\n\r\nThen he interested himself very strongly in the attempt which was made\r\nin 1848 to banish the Austrians from the North of Italy. “Things have\r\ngone much too far to admit of the possibility of any future connection\r\nbetween the Italians and Austria.” And again, “I certainly agree with\r\nyou and your Austrian friend that Austria would be much better out of\r\nItaly than in it. Italy can never now be a useful possession for\r\nAustria.” And again, “On the whole, the conclusion to which I should\r\ncome is, that the cheapest, best, and wisest thing which Austria can do,\r\nis to give up her Italian possessions quietly and at once, and to direct\r\nher attention and energy to organizing the remainder of her coast\r\nterritories, and to cement them together, and to develop their abundant\r\nresources;”--to induce the Austrians to abandon their Austrian\r\npossessions as a matter of pure policy. “But to do this there ought to\r\nbe some able men at the head of affairs, and our doubt is whether there\r\nare any such now in office. First and foremost, what is the animal\r\n_implumis bipes_, called Emperor? A perfect nullity; next thing to an\r\nidiot.” Then he discusses the practicability of an abdication, or rather\r\ntwo abdications, with a wisdom and foresight to which events have given\r\ntheir ample testimony. Francis Joseph, the Emperor of to-day, was, after\r\na while, elected in place of his uncle, and has since reigned, through\r\nmany troubles, with good sense and moderation.\r\n\r\n“How can an empire stand in these days without an emperor at its head?\r\nAnd by an emperor, I mean a man endowed with intellectual faculties\r\nsuited to his high station.” And again, “I fear that his next brother is\r\nlittle better than he is; but could not the son of that brother be\r\ncalled to the succession?” But it is remarkable that this is all written\r\nto our ambassador at Vienna, and is written as advice to be given to an\r\nAustrian Minister. “Pray then, tell Wessemberg from me, but in the\r\nstrictest confidence, that I would entreat of him and his colleagues to\r\nconsider, for the salvation of their country, whether some arrangement\r\ncould not be made by which the Emperor might abdicate.” Can we imagine\r\nany foreign minister recommending to an English statesman the abdication\r\nof a British sovereign? In this case, no doubt, the abdication had been\r\npreviously discussed; but still the audacity, necessary for such advice\r\nfrom an Englishman, was very great. Fighting, however, in the meantime,\r\nwas going on, and Radetsky, on the part of Austria, was victorious at\r\nMilan. France and England joined to assist Sardinia by their moral\r\nweight, and an armistice was concluded.\r\n\r\nBut Palmerston will not give up his points. “The real fact is that the\r\nAustrians have no business in Italy at all, and have no real right to be\r\nthere.” This he writes to Lord Ponsonby at Vienna, and says very evil\r\nthings of the Austrian mode of governing. “The only Austrians have been\r\nthe troops, and the civil officers. She has governed it as you govern a\r\ngarrison town, and her rule has always been hateful.” Then he expresses\r\nhis strong resentment against attempts which have been made from Vienna,\r\nor which he thinks have been made, to influence the English Court. “I\r\nquite understand the drift and meaning of Prince Windischgrätz’s message\r\nto our Queen; but pray make the Camarilla understand that, in a\r\nconstitutional country like England, these things cannot answer; and\r\nthat a foreign Government, which places its reliance upon working upon\r\nthe Court against the Government of this country, is sure to be\r\ndisappointed.” But in his strong feeling against Austria and in favour\r\nof Italy, in his passionate dislike to the Austrian mode of government,\r\nand his strong love for that which he believed would be the Italian mode\r\nof government in Italy, he runs into some absurdities which are\r\ncontradicted in the same letter. “Providence,” he says, “meant mankind\r\nto be divided into separate nations, and for this purpose countries have\r\nbeen founded by natural barriers, and races of men have been\r\ndistinguished by separate languages, habits, manners, dispositions, and\r\ncharacters.” Then he goes on; “North of the Alps, we wish her”--that is\r\nAustria--“all the prosperity and success in the world;” though the\r\nAustrian and the Hungarian are also distinguished by separate language,\r\nhabits, and manners. But for the moment the contest was brought to an\r\nend by the victory of Austria, and ten years had to pass by before Lord\r\nPalmerston saw all his hopes for Italy realized by the unification of\r\nthe country under the Sardinian crown.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the Session in 1849 Mr. Disraeli brought on a vote\r\nof want of confidence in the Government. Lord Palmerston writes thus to\r\nhis brother; “After all the trumpetings of attacks that were to demolish\r\nfirst one and then another member of the Government--first me, then\r\nGrey, then Charles Wood--we have come triumphantly out of all debates\r\nand divisions, and end the Session, stronger than we began it. Our\r\ndivision this morning, on Disraeli’s motion ‘On the State of the\r\nNation,’ was 296 to 156--a majority of 140.” And in the House of Lords,\r\nLord Brougham fared no better. “Sicily, Lombardy and Rome will be the\r\nmain topics on which Brougham, Stanley and Aberdeen--the three witches\r\nwho have filled the cauldron--will dilate.” France had at this time\r\n“occupied” Rome. “The questions which will naturally be asked are; In\r\nwhat character has the French army taken possession of Rome? Is it as\r\nconquerors of a city to be added to France? Of course not; that answer\r\nis easily given. Is it, then, as friends of the Pope, or as friends of\r\nthe Roman people?” It was a question which would naturally be asked. But\r\nthe French had taken possession of Rome to guard it equally from the\r\nPope and from the people. The above was written on the 16th July, 1849.\r\nOn the previous 24th of November the Pope had escaped from Rome in\r\ndisguise, and had got as far as Gaeta on his way to Majorca. He did not\r\ngo further on that journey, and there we may leave him, remarking that\r\nit was less than thirty months since he had received as a reforming Pope\r\nprofessions of universal affection from the Roman people.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston feels himself compelled to ask hypothetical questions of\r\nthe French Government, and to put hypothetical answers into its mouth.\r\nWe can see that he is in truth jealous that there is a European pie in\r\nwhich he is not allowed to have a finger. But there is not a word in\r\nwhat he says in which an ordinary Englishman does not sympathize. “There\r\nare mutually repellent properties between a reasoning people and an\r\nelective priestly Government.” “The Roman people will ere long reply by\r\nsaying; We are no longer Papists; take your Pope and give him as\r\nsovereign to those who are Papists still. The Reformation in Europe was\r\nas much a movement to shake off political oppression as it was to give\r\nfreedom to religious conscience, and similar causes are apt to produce\r\nsimilar effects.” Then there has come an attack upon him as Foreign\r\nMinister from Lord Aberdeen, whom he takes an opportunity of “paying\r\noff,” as he calls it. He does pay him off--with great severity, with\r\ngood thorough-going abuse, which is, however, altogether parliamentary.\r\nThe entire speech is too long to be given here with the necessary\r\nexplanations. But he winds up as follows; “I will only say that the\r\nconduct of such men is an example of antiquated imbecility.” The “such\r\nmen” is, of course, Lord Aberdeen. The next day, no doubt, he would have\r\nbeen on excellent terms with Lord Aberdeen had he met him.\r\n\r\nThen, still in 1849, there is a difficulty as to the amount of\r\nassistance to be given to Turkey in holding her own against Austria and\r\nRussia. The Hungarian conflict had come on, in which Hungary had\r\nendeavoured to maintain her own kingdom and her own government, as\r\nseparated from that of Austria. The Hungarians were willing that the\r\nEmperor of Austria should be King of Hungary, but refused to assent to\r\nany other joining of the two countries. Here again Palmerston had not\r\nhis fingers very deep in the pie. How far he may have been restrained by\r\ncolleagues in his Cabinet, we do not know; but we do remember how, when\r\nAustria was hard pressed by her rebels, she was assisted by Russia; and\r\nwe do know, also, how ungratefully Austria behaved on the occasion. But\r\nwhen the Hungarians were beaten, some of their leaders, and Kossuth\r\namong them, escaped into Turkey. Then Russia and Austria demanded the\r\nextradition of these rebels, and the Sultan was encouraged to withhold\r\nthem by Sir Stratford Canning, who now first comes forward as the great\r\nfriend of the Porte.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston also warmly takes the part of the Turks, and will not\r\nallow the men to be surrendered. It is this affair which gives the chief\r\ninterest to the autumn of 1849. He writes on the matter very hotly to\r\nLord Ponsonby. “As to working upon their feelings of generosity and\r\ngentlemanlikeness”--the feelings of the Austrians--“that is out of the\r\nquestion, because such feelings exist not in a set of officials who have\r\nbeen trained up in the school of Metternich, and the men in whose minds\r\nsuch inborn feelings have not been crushed by Court and office power,\r\nhave been studiously excluded from public affairs, and can only blush in\r\nprivate for the disgrace which such things throw upon their country. But\r\nI do hope that you will not fail constantly to bear in mind the country\r\nand the Government which you represent, and that you will maintain the\r\ndignity and honour of England by expressing openly and decidedly the\r\ndisgust which such proceedings excite in the public mind in this\r\ncountry.” It is evident that he had heard something of which he does not\r\napprove in Lord Ponsonby’s mode of thinking. “The remedy against these\r\nvarious dangers, which are rapidly undermining the Austrian Empire,\r\nwould be generous conciliation; but instead of that, the Austrian\r\nGovernment knows no method of administration but what consists in\r\nflogging, imprisoning, and shooting. The Austrians know no argument but\r\nforce.” The two fleets (the English and the French) were moved up to\r\nthe Dardanelles. “In this affair we are trying to catch two great fish,\r\nand we must wind the reel very gently and dexterously, not to break the\r\nline.” This he says to Sir Stratford Canning. He declares to Brunnow,\r\n“That our sending our squadron up the Mediterranean was, for the Sultan,\r\nlike holding a bottle of salts to the nose of a lady who had been\r\nfrightened.” Of course he has his way, and Turkey is not allowed to give\r\nup the Hungarians, though he ascertains in the course of the\r\ncorrespondence that Lord Ponsonby, his own ambassador at Vienna, is\r\nopposed to the instructions which he receives. But he reprimands him at\r\nlast with severity. “I write you this, and desire you to do your best;\r\nthough I hear from many quarters that you oppose instead of furthering\r\nthe policy of your Government, and that you openly declare that you\r\ndisapprove of our course. No diplomatist ought to hold such language as\r\nlong as he holds his appointment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF DON PACIFICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Don Pacifico is interesting, dramatic, and peculiar, and\r\nemblematic in the highest degree of Lord Palmerston’s manner of feeling\r\nand condition of mind. In it he will be seen carrying British honesty,\r\nBritish honour, and British determination to the very verge of absurdity\r\nand arrogance, till he pushes his principles almost beyond the verge.\r\nBut who shall say what is absurdity? And he is held to have been\r\nthoroughly triumphant in the whole affair, because at last he got a\r\nmajority of the House of Commons to vote that he had been splendidly\r\nEnglish and splendidly honest rather than absurd and arrogant. We may be\r\nsure that the statesmen of other nations ridiculed him, but that they\r\ndid so with a mixture of awe, knowing that it was Palmerston,--and\r\nknowing that Palmerston must be allowed to have his own way in such\r\nmatters,--unless he were stopped by his own countrymen. And a great\r\nattempt was made by his own countrymen to keep him down, and to prove\r\nthat he had been ridiculous. Lord Stanley, who, since 1844, had been in\r\nthe Upper House, brought a direct motion against him, in which he was\r\nsupported by Lord Aberdeen and Lord Canning; and he carried his\r\nresolution by a majority of thirty-seven. Lord Stanley had not forgotten\r\nthe accusations of official ignorance made against him by Lord\r\nPalmerston; and Lord Aberdeen’s memory was still laden with the\r\nbitterness of that “example of antiquated imbecility,” as which he had\r\nbeen represented to the House of Commons. For amenities such as these\r\nLord Palmerston was too wise to expect in return aught but similar\r\namenities.\r\n\r\n“I can only say,” said Lord Stanley, “that I have arisen from the\r\nperusal of these papers,”--and he describes the documents in his hands,\r\nall referring to claims made by Lord Palmerston against Greece, as a\r\nweary waste of papers,--“with regret and shame for the part which my\r\ncountry has played.” Then he takes the proud ground that the weakest and\r\nthe strongest nations should in such matters be treated alike; and he\r\nasks whether such has been the case--imputing, of course, to Lord\r\nPalmerston the degrading fault that he has been imperious only against\r\nthe weak. Then he recapitulates the absurd cases for redress as to which\r\nLord Palmerston sent the British Fleet to the Piræus,--a fleet larger,\r\nas Lord Aberdeen goes on to say, than that with which Nelson conquered\r\nat Trafalgar. Can this, we wonder, have been true? There is the matter\r\nof Stellio Sumachi, the blacksmith, which was of itself a very trivial\r\naffair. Then there was the question of two of our war vessels, the\r\n_Fantôme_ and the _Spitfire_. A midshipman out of one had landed in\r\nplain clothes where he ought not to have landed, and officers of the one\r\nship were taken to have been officers of the other. This had given\r\nground for great offence to British honour. There was the plunder of\r\nsome Ionian boats at Salcina, Ionians being regarded in Athens as being\r\nGreeks well able to take care of themselves,--whereas to Lord Palmerston\r\nthey were British subjects. Then there was the case of certain Ionians\r\nwho had laid themselves down in the street to get rid of the fleas\r\nwhich were intolerable in their houses. With these men the police had\r\ninterfered, as they certainly should not have interfered with British\r\nsubjects afraid of fleas. Then there was a bit of ground, which Mr.\r\nFinlay had bought for £10 or £20, amounting to less than an acre. This\r\nwas included in King Otho’s garden without payment, whereas a Britisher\r\nshould, of course, have been paid,--and Mr. Finlay demanded about\r\n£1,500. He did ultimately get £1,000. And lastly there was Don Pacifico,\r\nthe Jew. It had been the custom of the Greeks at a certain festival to\r\nburn the figure of Judas; but one of the Rothschilds had come to Athens,\r\nand it was thought that this Christian ceremony would be distasteful to\r\nhim. Therefore the Greeks omitted to burn the Judas, but did burn Don\r\nPacifico’s house, and among the rioters who burnt it was the son of the\r\nGreek Minister of War. Now, Don Pacifico, though his relations were\r\nsupposed to have been Portuguese-Jews, had resided at Gibraltar, or, as\r\nsome said, had been born there. He had at any rate made out for himself\r\nsome claim to British citizenship. It sufficed for Lord Palmerston; but\r\nthe amount of compensation claimed by Don Pacifico was, among the many\r\nabsurdities, the most absurd. There were certain Portuguese documents\r\nwhich were represented as of immense value. They had been burned, and\r\n£26,000 had been charged for them, though they seem to have consisted\r\nonly of letters from Don Pacifico in which he made his claim, and from\r\nthe Portuguese Government denying that anything was due to him. All\r\nthese points Lord Stanley exposed, and he ended by moving; “That, while\r\nthe House fully recognizes the right and duty of the Government to\r\nsecure to her Majesty’s subjects residing in Foreign States the full\r\nprotection of the laws of those States, it regrets to find, by the\r\ncorrespondence recently laid upon the table by her Majesty’s command,\r\nthat various claims against the Greek Government, doubtful in points of\r\njustice, or exaggerated in amount, have been enforced by coercive\r\nmeasures, directed against the commerce and people of Greece, and\r\ncalculated to endanger the continuance of our friendly relations with\r\nother Powers.” He carried his motion, as I have said, by thirty-seven\r\nvotes. During the debate, Lord Aberdeen spoke of the “cry of\r\nindignation” which had been called forth throughout Europe by the doings\r\nof our fleet; and Lord Cardigan threatened the peers with a great war.\r\n\r\nThe joy was great among Lord Palmerston’s enemies; and it will be\r\nunderstood that they were numerous. He had against him generally the\r\ndiplomacy of Europe. First of all the French were very hostile to him.\r\nThe hostility of Thiers and Guizot still remained, kept warm among the\r\narchives of the French Foreign Office. And the Austrians and the\r\nPrussians and the Russians were all hostile to him;--and the Bavarians,\r\nof whose king, Otho, the young king of Greece, was son. The French, as\r\nhe complains, were treating him with gross ingratitude. When the French\r\nwere making demands on Morocco, which Palmerston himself describes as\r\n“unusual and exaggerated,” had not our consul, “first spontaneously, and\r\nthen by instructions from me,” and “by an infinity of trouble,” talked\r\nthe Moors into paying? But, he tells Lord Normanby, that when we ask for\r\nour own, “we find the French Minister, faithful to the course which\r\nFrench diplomacy has for years past pursued in Greece, encouraging the\r\nGreek Government to refuse, and thus doing all he can to drive us to\r\nthe necessity of employing force to obtain redress.” And even among\r\nEnglishmen a strong party has been made against him. Even his own friend\r\nLord Normanby, his own ambassador in Paris, does not seem to have\r\nassisted him with his whole heart in what he was doing. “As to the\r\nmelodrama which you talk of, it seems to me to have been the right\r\ncourse.” “But we have all along been thwarted in Greece by the intrigues\r\nand cabals of French agents, who have encouraged the Greek Government to\r\nill-use our subjects and to refuse us satisfaction, and of course\r\nThouvenel is frantic that at last we have lost patience.” And Russia is\r\nas hostile as France. He writes to Lord Bloomfield; “We do not mind the\r\nRussian swagger and attempt to bully about Greece. We shall pursue our\r\nown course steadily and firmly, and we must and shall obtain the\r\nsatisfaction we require.” “I have been so busy fighting my battle with\r\nFrance, that I have been obliged to put off for a time taking up again\r\nmy skirmish with Russia.” “There have been in London within the last\r\nweek letters from Madame Lieven to friends of hers here, abusing me like\r\na pickpocket.” And he complains of our own newspapers. In writing to the\r\nPrime Minister, he talks of “the boastful threats made by the _Times_\r\nnewspaper as to what Russia would do to put a stop to our proceedings in\r\nGreece.” Then again he writes to Lord John as to a question which is to\r\nbe brought before the Cabinet on the next day. He has already obtained a\r\ndeposit from the Greek Government, and the question is mooted whether\r\nthe deposit shall not be returned. “Normanby’s conversation with the\r\nPresident brings another question under the consideration of the\r\nCabinet. Louis Napoleon would be satisfied, as I infer, if to the\r\narbitration we added the restitution of the deposit, and this the\r\nCabinet will have to consider to-morrow. The reasons for and against\r\nseem to me to be much as follows.” He then proceeds to explain why he\r\nthinks the deposit should be kept in hand, and he evidently feels that\r\nthe Cabinet may be against him. Indeed, he fears that many are opposed\r\nto him who should be his friends, as well as all who are naturally his\r\nenemies. And we can see that it is not about this affair of Don Pacifico\r\nthat his mind is anxious. Don Pacifico is such a flea as that which\r\ndisturbed the slumbers of the British Ionians. And Greece, with its\r\nfreedom, of which by this time Palmerston had become nearly sick, was\r\nnot much more. Shall he, or shall he not, be able to hold his head on\r\nhigh amidst the deep Court waters, in which he had so long been\r\nstruggling? For the battle with him was one against the absolutism of\r\nrulers, on behalf of the constitutional rule of nations. With the rulers\r\nwere their favourites and Ministers,--and indeed masters; for who need\r\nbe told that a Metternich was, in fact, master in the Court of Vienna?\r\n“We have long had all these things in our own hands,” we can imagine\r\nthey would say to themselves. “All the glory and the power, and the\r\nsilks and the satins, and the soft words and courtly shows of imperial\r\nrule; and here is this man, who has crept in among us; and has become by\r\nhis own audacity the first of our order, and is daily lecturing us as to\r\nthe way in which we shall do our business! And at the bottom is he not\r\nas abominable a Revolutionist as any of them? Are we not, among us, able\r\nto put him down; and shall we not use the power which, by the excess of\r\nhis own arrogance, he has now given us?” Thus it is we can imagine that\r\nthey spoke among themselves, not without sundry endeavours to inveigle\r\nhis own servants in their own Courts. And we can imagine also in what\r\nlanguage Palmerston spoke to himself, when he looked round about him in\r\nthe world and saw what was going on. He had been continually prompted to\r\narrogance by the conviction that in no other way could he withstand the\r\ncounts and barons, the duchesses and princesses. He must have known of\r\nhimself that he was arrogant; but he must have known also that when he\r\nwould yield an inch he would at once fall, an ell at a time. The motives\r\nin men’s minds are mixed. We do believe that with him a true love of\r\nliberty had grown up amidst his Foreign Office duties, forcing him to\r\nthink rather of the English nation than of the ways of Courts. But there\r\nhad grown with it a lust of personal power and a desire to rule from his\r\ndesk in Downing Street as much of Europe as he could get into his hands.\r\nSo should the Turk do under certain circumstances, and so the Austrian,\r\nso the Russian, so the Greek, and the Spaniard,--and so, also, as far as\r\nmight be possible, the Frenchman. Of course, with so many efforts, he\r\noften failed; but as he went on he saw, or thought he saw, that where he\r\nfailed there had come misfortune to the world at large; and where he had\r\nsucceeded, prosperity.\r\n\r\nWhen he had found, or thought that he had found, that a thing was just,\r\nhe would have his own way, and was not unfrequently earned astray from\r\njustice in the pursuit of power. Greece had become to him a very\r\nstumbling-block of offences. Prince Otho of Bavaria, who had been sent\r\nthere to be King, hardly with Palmerston’s assent, had not at all\r\nanswered the purpose of his mission. The Constitutional Government which\r\nwas promised had been delayed, and was never really established under\r\nKing Otho. Misrule of all kinds became rampant; and matters arose which,\r\nwith all his patience, must have driven Palmerston nearly mad in his\r\nefforts to keep men--not right, but from drifting into recognized\r\nillegality. That Mr. Finlay, who had bought his bit of ground, and had\r\nhad it taken from him without payment and could get not even an answer\r\nwhen he sent in his bill, must have been a provoking stumbling-block. So\r\nalso was Don Pacifico, with his abominable pettifogging Levant lies and\r\nhis Jew villanies. I can imagine that, though it did not suit Lord\r\nPalmerston openly to abuse Don Pacifico, he must have hated him in the\r\ncore of his heart. And those flea-bitten Ionians, and even the silly\r\nEnglish sailors, must have been distasteful to him. Such a bill as Don\r\nPacifico sent in! There were sofas, ottomans, and consoles of most\r\nportentous manufacture; and, above all things, there was a _lit\r\nconjugal_, which must have been surely kept for the expected arrival of\r\na young Duke and Duchess. Lord Stanley says he prefers, in giving the\r\ninventory of the furniture, the language of Don Pacifico to\r\nthe more homely phrase, a double-bed. And then those Portuguese\r\ndocuments,--invaluable, not to be replaced, and now gone for ever!\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston of course knew, as well as did Lord Stanley, that Don\r\nPacifico’s bill was a hideous Levant fraud from beginning to end, having\r\nits only base of justice in the fact that the Greek Government had\r\nrefused to acknowledge it at all. A Greek, of some position in his\r\ncountry, had been present in the streets encouraging the rioters when\r\nthe house had been burnt down, and the police had refused to notice the\r\nmatter. Application over and over again had been made for\r\nredress,--that due inquiries should at any rate be made; but nothing had\r\nbeen done, and Lord Palmerston would not put up with it Don Pacifico was\r\nthe last ounce which broke the camel’s back. No doubt Greece was a\r\ndifficulty to him, and specially a difficulty because she was powerless\r\nto protect herself. King Otho and his Ministers were probably instigated\r\nby others to use their own weakness. When Great Britain finds a\r\ndifference between herself and France or the United States, no doubt she\r\nmust bide her time and wait till just inquiries have been made before\r\ntrue justice shall have been,--or shall not have been, discovered. But\r\nwith Greece,--with Greece who was there as a separate nation, partly, if\r\nnot mainly, by his own efforts,--it was out of the question that Great\r\nBritain should allow herself to be laughed at. It was at any rate, out\r\nof the question with Lord Palmerston. So he sent a fleet,--perhaps\r\nlarger than was necessary,--to exact damages. Certainly it was larger if\r\nit would have sufficed at the date of Trafalgar to beat the united\r\nnavies of France and Spain;--but we doubt the fact. “Even\r\nthis Pacifico,--this vile Portuguese Jew, this scum of the\r\nMediterranean,--shall have such justice as he may deserve; and if he\r\nhave much more than justice, that will be the fault of those who refused\r\nto inquire into the matter when some inquiry was possible.” It was thus,\r\nthat we can imagine Palmerston to have spoken to himself.\r\n\r\nThe matter took wide proportions and loomed large as though it would\r\nassume European greatness. Baron Gros was sent from France as a\r\nmediator, and the French Ambassador was actually withdrawn from London.\r\nIt is hardly necessary now to make all the ins and outs intelligible to\r\nthe reader. At last the matter was settled. Mr. Finlay was paid and Don\r\nPacifico received compensation. Lord Palmerston had so far been\r\nvictorious. But the time had come in which the contest was to be\r\ntransferred from the Piræus, and to be fought out in London. It has been\r\ntold how Lord Stanley, whom we remember better now as Lord Derby, and\r\nLord Aberdeen, had risen in their wrath, backed by Lord Cardigan and the\r\nmajority of the Peers generally. What influence had been at work who can\r\nsay? But it was natural that such influence should prevail. That Lord\r\nStanley did blush for his country, and that Lord Aberdeen did hear a cry\r\nof indignation, and Lord Cardigan fear a general war, was, perhaps,\r\ntrue. But the blushes and the cry and the fears were extended only to a\r\nlimited area. The Princes and the Countesses blushed and feared. The\r\nLords having carried their resolution showed no purpose of going any\r\nfurther. But Lord Palmerston having been so treated could not allow the\r\nmatter to rest there. He was not a man specially fond of making\r\nspeeches; but here was a case in which, unless a speech could be made to\r\nsome effect, he must acknowledge himself to have been beaten. In the\r\nHouse of Lords Viscount Canning, the son of Lord Palmerston’s old master\r\nin politics, and who afterwards served in the Cabinet with him and was\r\nhis Governor-General for India, finished his speech as follows; “If it\r\nwas fated that a page in their history must be defaced by the record of\r\na policy founded on injustice, conducted with arrogance, and closed\r\nwithout dignity, let them at least have the consolation to know that the\r\nsame page would bear witness that their policy received, at the earliest\r\nopportunity circumstances would permit, its direct, deliberate, and\r\nunqualified condemnation in a censure of the House of Lords.” Lord\r\nCanning was not then so great a man as he became afterwards; but it was\r\nnecessary that language such as this should receive a direct refutation\r\nin the House of Commons, seeing that it had been asserted in the House\r\nof Lords. If this could not have been made to come to pass Lord\r\nPalmerston must have retired.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1850, the debate took place in the House of Lords. As no\r\nhostile motion was intended to follow up in the House of Commons the\r\nhostility of the Lords, the matter must be met by a movement on the\r\nother side. There was a consultation, no doubt, between Palmerston and\r\ncertain of his friends, and it was decided that the service of Mr.\r\nRoebuck should be employed,--more especially as Mr. Roebuck had more\r\nthan once opposed the foreign policy of the great Foreign Minister.\r\nThere was some flattery in the selection no doubt, but it availed. On\r\nJune 24, therefore the member for Sheffield moved that “The principles\r\non which the foreign policy of Her Majesty’s Government have been\r\nregulated have been such as were calculated to maintain the honour and\r\ndignity of this country; and, in times of unexampled difficulty, to\r\npreserve peace between England and the various nations of the world.”\r\nMr. Roebuck, though his speech was long and somewhat inflated, did\r\nrepresent the matter well, looking at it from Lord Palmerston’s side.\r\n\r\nThen arose a debate as of the gods,--remarkable among debates for the\r\nlength and strength of the speakers, as also, in the case of many of\r\nthem, for the excellence of their speeches. Sir Frederick Thesiger was\r\nlonger than Mr. Roebuck, and Sir James Graham almost as long. They were\r\nmen conspicuous then among Tories, and they both did their best against\r\nthe Foreign Secretary. That Lord John Manners should have done so, and\r\nSidney Herbert, and Sir Robert Peel,--who now, alas, spoke for the last\r\ntime in that House,--and Mr. Disraeli, the lion and the lamb thus lying\r\ndown together, was what we should have expected to find on looking back\r\nto the debate. But Sir W. Molesworth spoke on the same side, and Mr.\r\nCobden, both, no doubt, moved by high ideas of conscience. The strongest\r\nspeech of all, however, as against the Government, and the most damning\r\nto Lord Palmerston, was that spoken by Mr. Gladstone, who, sitting on\r\nthe Tory benches, rose in his rage, and laid about him with all that\r\ndamaging passion of which he was then, when a Tory, almost as great a\r\nmaster as he has since proved himself in the Liberal ranks. As this is a\r\nshort memoir of Lord Palmerston’s life, I cannot deal at length with Mr.\r\nGladstone’s speech on that occasion. We can see him, however, and hear\r\nhim as he rebukes the weary House. “What, sir, are there gentlemen in\r\nthis House who can pursue their idle chat while words like these are\r\nsounding in their ears? If there are, I must tell them frankly that I am\r\nnot a little mortified at their withholding from myself the compliment\r\nof their attention.” And again, he is Gladstone himself, as he speaks of\r\nwhat the mighty owe to the feeble. “No, sir, let it not be so. Let us\r\nrecognize, and recognize with frankness, the equality of the weak with\r\nthe strong, the principles of brotherhood among nations and of their\r\nsacred independence.” There were giants also on the Government side of\r\nthe House. Bernal Osborne, Sir George Grey, Monckton Milnes, and Lord\r\nJohn Russell all spoke well. But among those who supported Lord\r\nPalmerston, Mr. Cockburn, our Lord Chief Justice afterwards, was the\r\nmost effective. His speech to this day is admirable reading, as indeed\r\nwere many of the speeches then made. Baillie Cochrane, now Lord\r\nLamington, who had long been a popular member of the House, had written\r\na pamphlet strongly condemnatory of Greece and of the gross injustice\r\nwhich prevailed there. But Mr. Cochrane was a Tory,--a very decided\r\nTory,--and had spoken against Palmerston in this debate with violence,\r\nand he now heard the words he had printed read to him with great effect\r\nby Mr. Cockburn. A more telling speech on Mr. Roebuck’s side could not\r\nhave been made than this quotation, as showing the impossibility of\r\nobtaining redress by law in Greece.\r\n\r\nBut the one speech of the occasion was that delivered by Lord\r\nPalmerston, and it was the greatest speech he ever made. It proved that\r\nhad he chosen to devote himself to that branch of politics, he could\r\nhave become a great orator. The debate lasted for four nights, and this\r\nspeech occupied four hours and a half. He was, in truth, pleading for\r\nhis life. And yet he seemed to take it quite calmly, and did not, during\r\nthe whole of the four hours, allow himself to be carried into any\r\nviolence. He went on with his arguments, never allowing them to fall\r\nflatly, but seldom attempting to rise to any excessive height. He laid\r\ndown his idea as to the redress to which an Englishman is entitled. “I\r\nsay, then, that our doctrine is, that, in the first instance, redress\r\nshould be sought from the law courts of the country; but that in cases\r\nwhere redress cannot be so had,--and those cases are many,--to confine a\r\nBritish subject to that remedy only would be to deprive him of the\r\nprotection which he is entitled to receive.”\r\n\r\nGoing on to the special case of Don Pacifico, he then explains the\r\ncircumstances. “What happened in this case? In the middle of the town of\r\nAthens, in a house which I must be allowed to say is not a wretched\r\nhovel, as some people have described it,--but it does not matter what it\r\nis, for whether a man’s home be a palace or a cabin, the owner has a\r\nright to be there safe from injury,--well, in a house which is not a\r\nwretched hovel, but which, in the early days of King Otho, was, I am\r\ntold, the residence of the Count Armansperg, the chief of the\r\nRegency,--a house as good as the generality of those which existed in\r\nAthens before the sovereign ascended the throne,--M. Pacifico, living in\r\nthat house, within forty yards of the great street, within a few minutes\r\nwalk of a guard-house where soldiers were stationed, was attacked by a\r\nmob. Fearing injury when the mob began to assemble, he sent an\r\nintimation to the British Minister, who immediately informed the\r\nauthorities. Application was made to the Greek Government for\r\nprotection. No protection was afforded. The mob, in which were soldiers\r\nand gens-d’armes, who even, if officers were not with them, ought, from\r\na sense of duty, to have interfered and to have prevented plunder,--that\r\nmob, headed by the sons of the Minister of War, not children of eight or\r\nten years old, but older,--that mob for nearly two hours employed\r\nthemselves in gutting the house of an unoffending man, carrying away or\r\ndestroying every single thing the house contained, and left it a perfect\r\nwreck.”\r\n\r\nThen he passes on to the general foreign policy of his administration,\r\nand answers the charges which had been made against him at great length\r\nby Sir James Graham. We cannot follow him here, as to do so we should be\r\ndriven to go back over the whole work of his life. But the clearness\r\nwith which it is all done is of such a nature that no one can now\r\nobtain a more lucid statement of the English view of European politics\r\nduring the period; and he then concludes his view of the manner in which\r\nGreat Britain could wish that her foreign affairs should be governed,\r\nand in which he thinks that they have been governed by him. “I do not\r\ncomplain of the conduct of those who have made these matters the means\r\nof attack upon Her Majesty’s Ministers. The Government of a great\r\ncountry like this is undoubtedly an object of fair and legitimate\r\nambition to men of all shades of opinion. It is a noble thing to be\r\nallowed to guide the policy, and to influence the destinies of such a\r\ncountry; and, if ever it was an object of honourable ambition, more than\r\never must it be so at the moment at which I am speaking. For while we\r\nhave seen, as stated by the right honourable baronet the member for\r\nRipon, the political earthquake rocking Europe from side to side,--while\r\nwe have seen thrones shaken, shattered, levelled,--institutions\r\noverthrown and destroyed,--while in almost every country of Europe the\r\nconflict of civil war has deluged the land with blood, from the Atlantic\r\nto the Black Sea, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, this country has\r\npresented a spectacle honourable to the people of England, and worthy of\r\nthe admiration of mankind.”\r\n\r\nThe speech was liked by the whole House, foes as well as friends. It was\r\nthus that all Englishmen felt that they would wish that an English\r\nMinister of State should defend himself and the Government to which he\r\nbelonged. “It has made us all proud of him,” said poor Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwho, after that day, never lived to express such pride again. Then came\r\nthe division; and, in a House of five hundred and seventy-four members,\r\nLord Palmerston was acquitted by a majority of forty-six. On the next\r\nday,--or, in truth, on that day, for the division was not taken till\r\nnearly four o’clock,--he sent a word of joy over to Lord Normanby. “Our\r\ntriumph has been complete in the debate, as well as in the division;\r\nand, all things considered, I scarcely ever remember a debate which, as\r\na display of intellect, oratory, and high and dignified feeling, was\r\nmore honourable to the House of Commons.”\r\n\r\nThere never had been a pitched battle fought on that arena in which the\r\nthing to be fought for was better understood, in which the combatants\r\nwere marshalled in fairer order, in which the strategy was of a higher\r\nnature, or the courage displayed more brilliant. Should the Whigs, plus\r\nPalmerston, be kept in office, or should they be expelled from office\r\nbecause of Palmerston’s ungovernable arrogance? The House of Commons and\r\nthe Whigs determined to keep Palmerston in his place. The victory was\r\nvery great, and the glory almost unbounded. The House of Lords was set\r\nat naught, and a majority of forty-six in the House of Commons was taken\r\nas showing the will of the entire nation.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to last for long. Lord Palmerston knew, or asserted that\r\nhe knew, where lay the real force which he had to encounter; and though\r\nhe sounded his trumpet loudly on the occasion, and in the moment of his\r\ntriumph forgot that his enemies still existed, he lived to remember\r\ntheir power. He thus wrote to his brother William; “The attack on our\r\nforeign policy has been rightly understood by everybody as the shot\r\nfired by a foreign conspiracy, aided and abetted by domestic intrigue.”\r\nHe goes on in the same letter to tell how he was invited to dinner by\r\ntwo hundred and fifty members of the Reform Club, and how the banquet\r\nmight have been extended to a thousand had it not been thought well to\r\nlimit the demonstration. It was after this victory that the famous\r\nportrait of Lord Palmerston was painted, and presented to Lady\r\nPalmerston, by a hundred and twenty members of the House of Commons.\r\nThis period,--the end, that is, of the session of 1850,--was the\r\nculminating point in the fortunes of our great Foreign Minister. He\r\nlived, indeed, to be twice Premier, and to have superintended the\r\ncounsels by which Nicholas was beaten to his death in the Crimean War;\r\nbut I do not think that he was ever as great as on the night on which he\r\ndefended himself for having protected Don Pacifico. Such is the story of\r\nDon Pacifico. How the battle was renewed under other auspices in the\r\nnext year, and how Lord Palmerston was then dismissed by the same Lord\r\nJohn Russell who now had defended him, must be told in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY TILL HIS DISMISSAL, IN 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston achieved his triumph in 1850, and encountered his\r\ndisgrace, if it is to be so considered, in 1851. There was but the one\r\nyear and a few months before his foes were too many for him. In\r\ndescribing this second battle, I shall endeavour to tell the story as\r\nthough the blow had come from Lord John Russell, the head of the\r\nCabinet, with such aid and counsel as may have been given to him by\r\nothers of his own class. Of the action of the Court, as told to us in\r\ndetail by Sir Theodore Martin, I have spoken in the first chapter, and\r\nit will be more convenient if I go on with Lord Palmerston’s career\r\nwithout much further allusion to it. He himself believed that he had\r\nbeen the victim of a foreign conspiracy, aided by those Englishmen who\r\nagreed that its purpose was good. In September, 1850, he thus wrote to\r\nhis brother,--after the affair of Don Pacifico; “I have beaten and put\r\ndown and silenced, at least for a time, one of the most widespread and\r\nmalignant and active confederacies that ever conspired against one man\r\nwithout crushing him; but I was in the right, and I was able to fight my\r\nbattle.” “The death of Louis Philippe delivers me from my most artful\r\nand inveterate enemy, whose position gave him in many ways the power to\r\ninjure me.” The readers of to-day will dislike the use of the word\r\nconspiracy, and will think that the powers brought to bear against the\r\nForeign Secretary were no more than those of fair political opposition.\r\nAnd it will probably be thought that Lord Palmerston was becoming too\r\npowerful in foreign affairs,--or was wont to express himself too\r\nloudly,--as has since come to be the case with another great arranger of\r\nEuropean strategy in another country. It was so. It is not within the\r\ncompass of a man’s nature to stretch his voice afar and yet to control\r\nthe power of his own hand. Looking back, we can understand that\r\nPalmerston should have fallen; but we all feel that had he not risen to\r\nhigher place because of his fall, England would have lost much by his\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1850 General Haynau came to London, and, among other\r\nsights, visited Barclay & Perkins’ brewery. According to English ideas\r\nhe had shown himself to be a brute during the Hungarian war; and very\r\nbrutally was he treated by the draymen. His name should not be mentioned\r\nhere but that all England was in a momentary ferment because of what had\r\nbeen done. It was generally thought that he had been maltreated, and\r\nthat, as he had not ill-used Englishmen or English women, we should have\r\ncontented ourselves with simply ignoring him when he trusted himself to\r\nour hospitality. Palmerston’s judgment as to what had been done was\r\nlenient. “The draymen were wrong in the particular course they adopted.\r\nInstead of striking him, which, however, by Koller’s account, they did\r\nnot do much, they ought to have tossed him in a blanket, rolled him in\r\nthe kennel, and then sent him home in a cab, paying his fare to the\r\nhotel.”\r\n\r\nIn his sixty-seventh year (January, 1851) he wrote to his brother from\r\nBroadlands. Speaking of the Christmas just past, he says; “I took a\r\nfling, and went out several days hunting and shooting in the fine of the\r\nearly day, coming home, of course, for work earlier than if I had been\r\nonly a sportsman.” Let gentlemen of sixty-seven who habitually go out\r\nhunting and shooting,--for I am aware that there are Englishmen of the\r\nage who do so,--bethink themselves of the manner in which they pass the\r\nremainder of the day after they have come home. Are they tired, and do\r\nthey sleep, or sit over their tea? Do they congratulate themselves that\r\nat sixty-seven they have been still able to perform so well many of the\r\nfeats of their youth? I think I may say that they, none of them, betake\r\nthemselves to the hard thoughtful work of their lives; and that, if such\r\nwork still falls to their lot, it has to be done before they go out\r\nhunting or shooting.\r\n\r\nHe, however, takes his share in all matters of interest. He knows what\r\nis doing as to fortifications, and takes a strong interest in the\r\nsubject. He writes to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; “Could you but\r\ntake a sum, however small, to make a beginning, for similar defences at\r\nPlymouth?” He is very eager as to some system of volunteering. “Every\r\nother country that deserves to be called a power has this kind of\r\nreserved force.” Then comes the great Exhibition of 1851,--the first of\r\nthose marvellous palaces of industry which have since been studded thick\r\nover the world’s surface. He is writing to Lord Normanby, and is\r\nspeaking of the multitude. “The Queen, her husband, her eldest son and\r\ndaughter, gave themselves in full confidence to this multitude, with no\r\nother guard than one of honour and the accustomed supply of stick-handed\r\nconstables.” And the Papacy has to be put down. “Our Papal Aggression\r\nBill will be carried in spite of the opposition of the Irish members\r\nwho are driven on by the influence of the priests over the Irish\r\nelectors.” As to this bill, however, I do not know that we are now\r\ninclined to take much pride to ourselves. Then Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nNeapolitan letters were written, and so moved Naples, through England,\r\nthat the Neapolitan prisons were at last opened. On this subject he\r\ntells an excellent story. “Walewski told Milnes the other day, as a\r\nproof of the goodness of heart of the King of Naples, that at his,\r\nWalewski’s request, the King had at one time promised to set free three\r\nhundred prisoners against whom no charge or no proof had been\r\nestablished. ‘How grateful,’ said Milnes, ‘these men must have been! Did\r\nthey not come and thank you for their release?’ ‘Why,’ said Walewski,\r\n‘you see, after the King had made the promise, the Chief of Police came\r\nto him, and said that if the men were set free he could not answer for\r\nthe King’s life. And so, you see, the men were not set free.’”\r\n\r\nIn November, 1851, we come to the cause of his fall,--which cause was in\r\ntruth Napoleon’s _Coup d’Etat_. The feeling in England, when the _Coup\r\nd’Etat_ was first made known, was very averse to it. There was a belief\r\nthat Napoleon had been guilty of falsehood and treachery. Mr. Kinglake,\r\nin his great work on the invasion of the Crimea, translates the words\r\nwhich Napoleon had used on the 13th of November, 1850--“The noblest\r\nobject, and the most worthy of an exalted mind, is not to seek when in\r\npower how to perpetuate it, but to labour incessantly to fortify, for\r\nthe benefit of all, those principles of authority and morality which\r\ndefy the passions of mankind and the instability of laws.” About a year\r\nafter he had uttered this philanthropic but sententious idea he had\r\nfilched the Empire. Englishmen did not like that; and though they were\r\ngradually won by the fealty of the Emperor to his English alliance so as\r\nto endure him, the stain of the falsehood still stuck to him through his\r\ntwenty years of governing. Such we think has been the English feeling.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the feeling of Lord Palmerston, who knew more as to the\r\nstate of Europe than any other Englishman, and was more keenly alive to\r\nthe immediate needs of both France and England. He writes to Lord\r\nNormanby; “There is no other person at present competent to be at the\r\nhead of affairs in France; and if Louis Napoleon should end by founding\r\na dynasty, I do not see that we need regret it as far as English\r\ninterests are concerned.” “At all events, I say of Louis Napoleon,\r\n_laudo manentem_.” But it was known that there had been private\r\nfriendship between the two men while Louis Napoleon was living in\r\nEngland, and also that there had been a strong aversion on the part of\r\nPalmerston to the whole family of Bourbons. The Bourbons had during the\r\nentire period of his career, both before and after the coming of the\r\nCitizen King, ruled after that mysterious and crafty fashion which had\r\nproduced at last the Spanish marriages. Palmerston no doubt desired\r\nsomething better than craft and mystery. The Bourbons had been expelled\r\nby the Revolution; but the Republic, as established with Louis Napoleon\r\nas its President, had not acted with much wisdom. To Palmerston’s\r\nthinking something more nearly akin to the established rule of a dynasty\r\nwas necessary for France,--and for England also if it was to remain in\r\nalliance with France,--than the wild and uninstructed enthusiasm of the\r\nAssembly. He did believe in Louis Napoleon, and continued no doubt to\r\nbelieve to the end of his life, justified, as he thought, by the French\r\nEmperor’s early successes, and also by his friendship for England. He\r\nhad left the world of politics before Napoleon had spun all his thread\r\nand run his reel out to the end. To me who write this, even the memory\r\nof the Emperor is distasteful. But the fall that was about to come upon\r\nPalmerston may have been in part due to his feeling for a man who stood\r\nhigher in his estimation than in that of his countrymen. Years\r\nafterwards, in 1858, he had to retire with his Government, of which he\r\nwas then the head, for a reason which was partly similar. We shall come\r\nto that before long; but it afforded another proof of the general tone\r\nof his mind towards Louis Napoleon.\r\n\r\nLord Normanby was our Ambassador in Paris; and from some cause, of which\r\nI know nothing, entertained different feelings. It may probably be that\r\nhe, as an honest man, disliked the dishonesty of the President. There\r\nwas a variance between him and Palmerston, and that too no doubt had its\r\neffect upon the coming circumstances. And it must be remembered that\r\nLord Palmerston was already labouring under a sense of the\r\ndisapprobation of his superior officers in that he would not submit his\r\ndespatches in time for such surveillance as it was thought that they\r\nshould receive. He had then against him at this moment the Prime\r\nMinister and his own Ambassador in Paris, who had been a Cabinet\r\nMinister, and the Court influence, and he had the feeling that he\r\nhimself was on too friendly terms with the man who had achieved the\r\n_Coup d’Etat_ by not the fairest means that ever were used in politics,\r\nand not by the cleanest instruments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be borne in mind that Palmerston knew\r\nhimself as few men do, and his own sagacity, and his general popularity\r\nin the country. His object was so to administer foreign affairs as might\r\nbest redound to the honour of his country, and he was aware that there\r\nwas no man in England who could teach him a lesson in that respect. As\r\nto his despatches, it was to him quite impracticable to encounter the\r\nrequired delay. There was an order to that effect, and other orders\r\ncame. He, however, if he remained Foreign Secretary, must do so after\r\nhis own fashion. But there arose at this moment another source of\r\ndispleasure against him, which, joined to his disobedience as to the\r\ndespatches, caused his dismissal.[H] Lord Palmerston had expressed to M.\r\nWalewski, who was then the Ambassador from France in London, his\r\napprobation of the _Coup d’Etat_. This assent had been given somewhat in\r\nan off-hand manner, so as not to have bound him absolutely to the words\r\nwhich he had used. He alleged that it was so. Count Walewski of course\r\nsent home to the new Emperor his report of the English Foreign\r\nSecretary’s opinion.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards Palmerston instructed Lord Normanby as to his\r\nconduct; “I am commanded by her Majesty to instruct your Excellency to\r\nmake no change in your relations with the French Government.” And it\r\nseems that some ill-feeling was engendered in Paris by priority of the\r\nprivate to the official communication made. The private communication\r\nhad been to the effect that Lord Palmerston entirely approved of what\r\nthe President had done. It must be said that he did not admit having\r\ngone so far as this. He pointed out that Walewski had reported from\r\nmemory the words spoken; that Turgot, the Minister in France, had\r\nreported the words verbally to Lord Normanby; and that Normanby had\r\nwritten home his remembrance of the anger which M. Turgot had expressed.\r\nM. Turgot was at loggerheads with Lord Normanby, M. Turgot representing\r\nthe President-Emperor. “You need not at all trouble yourself to tell us\r\n‘what you are commanded by her Majesty to instruct me,’ because we have\r\nknown two days since what was our friend Lord Palmerston’s opinion.” It\r\nwas thus that Turgot answered Lord Normanby,--with scorn added to\r\nacrimony, because Lord Normanby had ventured to suggest that had the\r\nEnglish Government pleased, the English Government might have interfered\r\nwith the French Government. Lord Normanby, in his official report,\r\ndistinctly stated that he had made this communication to M. Turgot. But\r\nLord Palmerston had never so instructed him; “I am commanded by her\r\nMajesty to instruct your Excellency to make no change in your relations\r\nwith the French Government.” There is no message contained in this, and\r\nthese are Lord Palmerston’s words; but Lord Normanby seems to have\r\nmisunderstood them. At any rate the private communication had reached\r\nParis first, and the official despatch two days afterwards. Then there\r\nwere official and semi-angry despatches between the two Lords in London\r\nand Paris, and the question of which was right fell into the hands of\r\nLord John Russell as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe gravamen of the charge now made was that the Foreign Secretary,\r\nwithout the sanction of the Cabinet, had taken upon himself to tell the\r\nFrench Ambassador that the President-Emperor had done uncommonly well by\r\narranging the _Coup d’Etat_. That readers should think that the\r\nPresident did very ill has nothing to do with the question. It is not\r\nalleged that there was disagreement in the Cabinet on that\r\npoint,--though no doubt there was either in the Cabinet or without the\r\nCabinet. This is simply a memoir of Lord Palmerston, and does not\r\npresume to be a vindication of his policy. And the present object is to\r\nshow why he was dismissed, and how he turned upon those who had\r\ndismissed him, and got the better of them. He himself, in a letter\r\nwritten a few days later to his brother, gives a detailed history of the\r\nwhole affair, in which he takes the trouble to show that as he had\r\nexpressed himself to Walewski, so had other members of the Cabinet said\r\nthe same thing to the same man at the same period; and he quotes Lord\r\nLansdowne, and Charles Wood, and John Russell himself. Am I forbidden to\r\ndo that which my colleagues did, what all London was doing,--that part\r\nof London who knew what they were talking about?\r\n\r\nI will quote his own words, in which he tells his brother how he had\r\ndefended himself to Lord John Russell. “I answered that his doctrine, so\r\nlaid down, was new and not practical; that there is a well-known and\r\nperfectly understood distinction in diplomatic intercourse between\r\nconversations which are official and which bind Governments, and\r\nconversations which are unofficial and which do not bind Governments;\r\nthat my conversation with Walewski was of the latter description, and\r\nthat I said nothing to him which would in any degree or in any way\r\nfetter the action of the Government; and that if it was to be held that\r\na Secretary of State could never express any opinion to a\r\nforeign Minister on passing events, except as the organ of a\r\npreviously-consulted Cabinet, there would be an end of that easy and\r\nfamiliar intercourse which tends essentially to promote good\r\nunderstanding between Ministers and Governments.” But as he goes on he\r\nexpresses himself more warmly; “It is obvious that the reason assigned\r\nfor my dismissal was a mere pretext, eagerly caught at for want of any\r\ngood reason. The real ground was a weak truckling to the hostile\r\nintrigues of the Orleans family, Austria, Russia, Saxony, and Bavaria,\r\nand in some degree also of the present Prussian Government. All these\r\nparties found their respective views and systems of policy thwarted by\r\nthe course pursued by the British Government, and they thought that if\r\nthey could remove the Minister they would change the policy.”\r\n\r\nThe “weak truckling” and the “hostile intrigues” I will lay aside,\r\nleaving it to the individual reader to judge of these expressions as he\r\nmay please. But it is manifest that there were running at the time in\r\nGreat Britain two currents as to foreign politics: the one which I can\r\nonly define as English;--and the other, which I call the policy of\r\nabsolutism, because I do not wish to descend to abuse, which I must do\r\nif I give to it any national name. That both were held with high\r\npatriotic ideas we should not doubt. Emperors and their Ministers\r\nnaturally believe in Emperors and their Ministers. Those who are opposed\r\nto them are, to their thinking, a stubborn revolutionary crowd. If by\r\nlittle tricks the absolute party can gain a point in their own favour, a\r\ngreat stroke of policy is made. But they who maintain that the united\r\nopinion of the world at large may be best used for the governance of the\r\nworld, may be as wise, and at any rate as honest, as their opponents. A\r\ncomparison of the national success of nations is in their favour. Lord\r\nPalmerston, during his whole life after he had come to think of these\r\nthings, and especially during the strongest part of his life in which he\r\npresided at the Foreign Office, held the British view, and would not\r\nallow himself to be driven from it for a moment. A constitutional king\r\ndid not, as he thought, rule in the sense of holding the strings of\r\nnational policy in his own hands. In defence of his view, he was\r\nauthoritative, imperious, arrogant,--sometimes even tyrannical, if you\r\nwill. The bull-dog can hardly hold tight by his bone without crushing\r\nit. But it is very difficult to get a bone out of the mouth of a\r\nbull-dog.[I]\r\n\r\nWhen called upon for his explanation by Lord John, Lord Palmerston gave\r\nit, with more precision than accuracy. His letter is dated the 16th of\r\nDecember. He went at length into the question of the President’s\r\nconduct, and justified the President’s judgment in the _Coup d’Etat_.\r\nBut it was not that which was now called in question. There was a\r\nrejoinder made to him in which he was expected to acknowledge his error\r\nin having spoken to Walewski. This he refused to do, and then, on the\r\n19th of December, there came the blow. Lord John wrote as follows; “I\r\nhave just received your letter of yesterday. No other course is left to\r\nme than to submit the correspondence to the Queen, and to ask Her\r\nMajesty to appoint a successor to you in the Foreign Office.” Lord\r\nPalmerston was dismissed. The dismissal of a Cabinet Minister, and of\r\nsuch a Cabinet Minister, was at any rate a most uncommon occurrence. It\r\nstruck Lord Macaulay as “rashly, needlessly harsh.” Lord John himself\r\nrepented of it. “My own judgment upon it is, that it was hasty and\r\nprecipitate,” he says--page 258, of his “Recollections and Suggestions.”\r\nHe thought to soften the blow by offering to the dismissed, but ever\r\nactive Secretary of State the _fainéant_ retreat of Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland. One is almost tempted to think that Palmerston was right when\r\nin his earlier years he spoke of the average Minister as one who would\r\n“by instinct come round to the oat sieve.”\r\n\r\nHe, however, would not come round after that fashion. He felt that it\r\nhad been for some time intended that he should be dismissed; and, now\r\nthat the blow had come, was by no means prepared to retire into\r\nobscurity and silence. But he seems to have experienced great difficulty\r\nin making up his mind how he would act. He did nothing;--nor was there\r\nanything to be done till Parliament should meet early in February. But\r\nit was, of course, manifest that Lord John should offer to the House his\r\nexplanation of the most unwonted circumstance. This he did in a very\r\npowerful speech; but he could speak, knowing that the Court was at his\r\nback. Lord Palmerston answered him, but he did so without such backing;\r\nand could hardly have made his points good without a reference to the\r\nCourt which his loyalty would forbid him to use. He seems to have\r\nrecognized the fact that he must accept his dismissal, and bide his\r\ntime, and try another fall with Lord John on other grounds. He knew his\r\npopularity with the country, and did not doubt his own power. Could he\r\nsucceed on other ground, the Queen would be bound to accept him. A short\r\ntime afterwards the Queen did accept him very willingly. But in his\r\npresent difficulty even his popularity would not suffice to put him\r\nstraight before the Parliament. It would not suit him, the old public\r\nservant of his country,--him who still hoped to serve his country\r\nlong,--to take upon himself the rôle of a demagogue, and join as he must\r\nhave joined the ultra-radicals in a vain endeavour to get a majority\r\nagainst his old chief. He made no effort of the kind, but allowed the\r\nmatter to pass by, defending himself only on small points,--as to which\r\nit was not claimed for him by his friends that he was especially\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe debate was thus described by Lord Dalling, who was especially\r\nPalmerston’s friend. “His speech,”--John Russell’s--“certainly was one\r\nof the most powerful I ever heard delivered. It was evidently intended\r\nto crush an expected antagonist, and, by the details into which it went,\r\ntook Lord Palmerston by surprise. I listened to his reply with the most\r\naffectionate interest, since he was kind enough to mention my own name\r\nwith praise; but I felt, and all his friends felt, that it was feeble as\r\na retort to the tremendous assault that had been made on him.”\r\n“‘Palmerston is smashed’ was, indeed, the expression generally used at\r\nthe clubs; but it did not in the least convey the idea that Lord\r\nPalmerston had formed of his own position. I must say, in truth, that I\r\nnever admired him so much as at this crisis. He evidently thought he had\r\nbeen ill-treated; but I never heard him make an unfair or irritable\r\nremark, nor did he seem in anywise stunned by the blow he had received,\r\nor dismayed by the isolated position in which he stood.” It was on this\r\noccasion that the witty Statesman expressed his opinion that “there was\r\na Palmerston”--Fuit Ilium et ingens gloria Teucrorum. That Statesman\r\nintended to express his opinion that the power of Palmerston was a thing\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\n    “So sinks the daystar in the ocean bed,\r\n     And yet anon repairs his drooping head,\r\n     And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore\r\n     Flames in the forehead of the morning sky!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON HOME SECRETARY, 1853 AND 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world had not to wait long. Lord Palmerston had, as we have seen,\r\nbeen turned out on the 19th of December, 1851. Parliament met on the 8th\r\nof February following, and before the month was over Lord John was out\r\nof office. A Militia Bill was brought in by him to which Palmerston\r\nexpressed himself as antagonistic. It is not supposed that he had been\r\nanxious to turn out his late chief on that special question, but had\r\nrather selected it as a commencement for his attack; but the House\r\nreconsidered the matter on which Lord John had been triumphant, and\r\nsupported the late Foreign Secretary so loudly by its cheers, as to make\r\nit apparent to the Head of the Government that he could no longer stand\r\nhis ground. It was then that Palmerston wrote as follows to his\r\nbrother;--“I have had my tit-for-tat with John Russell, and I turned him\r\nout on Friday last. I certainly, however, did not expect to do so, nor\r\ndid I intend to do anything more than to persuade the House to reject\r\nhis foolish plan and to adopt a more sensible one. I have no doubt that\r\ntwo things induced him to resign: first, the almost insulting manner\r\ntowards him in which the House, by its cheers, went with me in the\r\ndebate; and, secondly, the fear of being defeated on the vote of\r\ncensure about the Cape affairs which was to have been moved to-day.”\r\nLord Palmerston speaks of Lord John’s “foolish plan.” It may probably be\r\nsurmised that the abstract folly of the plan was not so potent with the\r\nwriter of the letter as the determination of which he speaks “to have\r\nhis tit-for-tat with John Russell.” It cannot be but that personal\r\nquestions in the bosoms of Statesmen should share the ground with\r\nmatters of public import, and often lead to the forming of an opinion or\r\nthe riveting of a doubt. If I hear of a public man with whom it has not\r\nbeen so, I feel that he must have lacked the warmth necessary for party\r\nconflict. “Measures not men,” is a great war-cry by which to gain the\r\nvoices of the ignorant; but, when they have been gained, men will count\r\nalmost for as much as measures.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston had at any rate delivered a knock-down blow, and Lord\r\nJohn was out. Lord Derby was sent for by the Queen, and in making his\r\nCabinet offered to Lord Palmerston the place of Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. It was just forty-three years since the same place was\r\noffered him before, and then, as now, by a Tory Prime Minister. What a\r\nlength of life to run between two such proposals! We are taught now to\r\nthink that a man who first undertakes such duties as those of regulating\r\nthe finances of his country at sixty-eight years of age, is taxing human\r\nnature too far; and certainly were we to hear that a youth of\r\ntwenty-five had been so selected, we should think that he was very\r\nprecocious, or that the Prime Minister was very silly. But this man\r\nrefused both offers; and, without going into the motives which induced\r\nhim to decline Lord Derby’s proposition, we cannot but rejoice that he\r\nsaw his way clearly to the refusal. We cannot but think that there\r\nwould have been a drifting back to Toryism under Lord Derby which would\r\nhave materially interfered with that popularity by which he was to be\r\nlifted up to the management of affairs during the Crimean War. In\r\ndiscussing with his brother the state of parties at the time, he thus\r\nsays;--“The truth is that the Whigs would be glad to get rid of John\r\nRussell and to have me in his stead, if this change could well be\r\naccomplished.” That, in truth, was the change which the Liberal party\r\ndesired, without probably any defined expression of such a wish. The\r\nqualities of Lord Palmerston’s mind had taken possession of men, and\r\nthough the English Liberal of to-day would probably think twice before\r\nhe would place the thoughtful statesmanship of the one below the happy\r\naudacity of the other, at the moment undoubtedly the country was tired\r\nof Lord John, and inclined to turn against him because he had turned out\r\nhis old colleague.\r\n\r\nNo weaker Government than that of Lord Derby’s was ever formed in\r\nEngland. The only persons in it well known at the time to political life\r\nwere Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli, who had fallen into the vacancy made\r\nby the death of a much weaker man than himself. Lord George Bentinck had\r\ngone, and left to Mr. Disraeli the leadership of the House of Commons.\r\nBut when we look back over the not long interval of nineteen years we\r\nhardly know who they were that he had to lead. It has been said that\r\nbesides Lord Derby and Mr. Herries there was not an English Privy\r\nCouncillor among the number. It included none of Sir Robert Peel’s\r\nfollowers. Free Trade was the one matter in dispute, and on the question\r\nof Free Trade there was a majority against Government consisting of\r\nPeelites, Whigs, and Radicals. Lord John and Lord Palmerston, together\r\nwith Sir James Graham and Mr. Gladstone, declared it to be impossible to\r\ncarry on the Government in such a condition of things. A new Parliament\r\nwas called, and on the 11th of November, 1852, the Queen’s Speech was\r\nread to them. Parliament was invited to consider whether recent\r\nlegislation had not inflicted unavoidable injury.[J] This was intended\r\nas a direct slap in the face for the advocates of Free Trade. Mr.\r\nVilliers moved a counter-resolution, full, as Mr. Disraeli said, of\r\n“odious epithets.” This was rejected by 336 votes to 256. Lord\r\nPalmerston then proposed a second resolution, declaring “That it is the\r\nopinion of the House that the improved condition of the people ... is\r\nmainly the result of recent legislation.” This was directly at variance\r\nwith the convictions of the Ministry, but it was accepted and allowed to\r\npass by a great majority. The resolution is supposed to have been\r\nprepared by Sir James Graham, in concert with Lord John. And the fact of\r\nits adoption by Lord Palmerston, and its promotion by him in political\r\nconcert with Lord John, proves that at this moment there was no war\r\nbetween the two old colleagues. The cause for war still remained, and\r\ndid in fact prevent for the present any combination of Statesmen in\r\nwhich Lord Palmerston should serve under Lord John; but of personal\r\nquarrel there was none, and the two men were thus able to act together\r\nwithin twelve months of the day on which the fatal letter had been\r\nwritten. Lord Palmerston had in June of that year declared his purpose\r\nnot to serve under Lord John. “He certainly has entirely lost mine.”\r\nLord John had lost Lord Palmerston’s confidence. “I feel no resentment\r\ntowards him personally or privately; but it would require strong\r\ninducements to persuade me to become again a member of a Government of\r\nwhich he was the head. I feel no confidence in his discretion or\r\njudgment as a political leader, and could place no trust in his steady\r\nfidelity as a colleague, having my official position at his mercy.”\r\n\r\nIt was in vain, however, that Lord Derby accepted the resolution in\r\nfavour of Free Trade. Mr. Disraeli brought in his Budget, which was at\r\nonce thrown out by 303 votes to 286. This took place on the 16th of\r\nDecember, and on the 20th Lord Derby declared that the Ministry had\r\nresigned. Lord Aberdeen was then sent for, and formed the Administration\r\nin which Lord John Russell went in as Foreign Secretary and Lord\r\nPalmerston to the Home Office. There must have been to him in this a\r\ncertain bitterness. He had at first declined Lord Aberdeen’s offer\r\nbecause Lord Aberdeen’s policy as Foreign Minister had for many years\r\nbeen at direct variance with his own. He had, however, been persuaded by\r\nLord Lansdowne, who had been better able, perhaps, to read the signs of\r\nthe times than could he himself, and the feelings of the minds of men\r\ntowards him against whom the Court had used its influence. He was\r\nassured that the administration of Foreign Affairs would not rest with\r\nLord Aberdeen, but with Lord Clarendon or Lord John,--and of the general\r\nliberality of both of these he was well assured. He says himself to his\r\nbrother that he had determined that he himself would not in any case\r\ntake the Foreign Office. In this, no doubt, there was some\r\nboasting,--natural and understood. It would have been impossible that\r\nLord Palmerston should then have returned to the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThere is something almost ludicrous in the energy displayed by Lord\r\nPalmerston at the Home Office; and yet it was essentially useful. He\r\nvisited prisons and wrote memoranda on the ventilation of cells. He\r\narranged tickets-of-leave for convicts, and attempted to abate the\r\nnuisance of smoke in London. He built cemeteries, and fixed the winter\r\nassizes. Such matters are by no means ludicrous. It is by attending to\r\nthem that the welfare of a people is in a great measure obtained. They\r\nare, no doubt, as important as those foreign arrangements for the\r\ngovernment of Europe,--and, indeed, of the world at large,--in which\r\nLord Palmerston had been hitherto engaged. But they do not loom so large\r\nbefore the imagination. And we can imagine that he himself felt the\r\ndifference when he descended from instructing Sir Stratford Canning to\r\nconsulting a factory inspector.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, I think, that he fell into a habit of\r\nintercourse with the public generally which adhered to him till the day\r\nof his death. He became notorious as a joker. He passed on from the\r\nlight, courteous _persiflage_ of the Foreign Minister to the common\r\nJohn-Bull fun of an English magistrate, without an apparent effort, but\r\nwith an evident intention. The wit was never very good. It must be\r\nacknowledged that it was generally commonplace, and that from the mouth\r\nof another it would have had no effect. But the world had so come to\r\nlove its Palmerston that it was ready to laugh at everything; and when\r\nthe world of deputations has been made to laugh, much has been\r\nachieved. The deputations did laugh, and Lord Palmerston obtained the\r\ncharacter of being the wittiest Englishman of his day. No character was\r\never more cheaply earned, or used to a better effect.\r\n\r\nLooking back at these days, we seem to remember that Lord Palmerston, as\r\nHome Secretary, appeared larger to us than did other Ministers of the\r\nday. He was not only Home Secretary, but had confided to him the duty of\r\ngeneral adviser in public matters. The great trouble of the Crimean War\r\nwas coming on, and the state of things was not so well known to others\r\nas to him. There was, too, a question as to Reform, regarding which he\r\nall but felt himself compelled to resign. “My office is too closely\r\nconnected with Parliamentary changes to allow me to sit silent during\r\nthe whole progress of a Reform Bill through Parliament; and I could not\r\ntake up a Bill which contained material things of which I disapprove,\r\nand assist to fight it through the House of Commons, to force it on the\r\nLords, and to stand upon it at the hustings.” This he said in a letter\r\nto his brother-in-law, Lawrence Sulivan. We can understand that, for the\r\nsatisfaction of his own political feelings, he need not have stirred\r\nhimself much on any question of Reform. But it must have been difficult\r\nfor him to have a Reform Bill settled for him while he was Home\r\nSecretary. There was, too, a double reason for his disagreement at the\r\nmoment. Should the fleet move up to the Dardanelles, or should it remain\r\nin the Mediterranean? This was in anticipation of that which afterwards\r\nbecame the Crimean War, and was a matter on which Lord Palmerston was\r\nlikely to have a more decided opinion than in regard to the Reform Bill.\r\nBut at last he withdrew his resignation. “I remain in the Government. I\r\nwas much and strongly pressed to do so for several days by many of the\r\nmembers of the Government, who declared that they were no parties to\r\nAberdeen’s answer to me, and that they considered all the details of the\r\nintended Reform measure as still open to discussion. Their earnest\r\nrepresentations and the knowledge that the Cabinet had on Thursday taken\r\na decision on Turkish affairs in entire accordance with opinions which I\r\nhad long unsuccessfully pressed upon them, decided me to withdraw my\r\nresignation, which I did yesterday.”\r\n\r\nThis was at the close of 1853, when Parliament was not sitting, and for\r\nthe next two years the Crimean War became so completely the one matter\r\nof vital interest to England as to make it necessarily the point on\r\nwhich a memoir of Lord Palmerston’s life for those two years must\r\naltogether hang. He was Home Secretary when the war began, but had been\r\nlifted up to the position of Prime Minister before its close. This was\r\ndone that England might be able to have, as she ought, the most\r\ncompetent man she possessed to conduct it for her. I am not expressing\r\nan opinion that he was the most competent man,--only that England so\r\nthought, and justified her opinion by the final result. But in truth the\r\ncapability of a man for such work does not depend on any power of\r\nintellect, or indomitable courage, or far-seeing cunning. The man is\r\ncompetent simply because he is believed to be so. A nation trusts a man,\r\nand will go to work under him in a manner which is impossible for it to\r\nadopt under a leader that it does not trust. And, as seems to be the\r\ncase with all men who are brought into a difficult operation, and\r\nsucceed in it, just at the moment convenient for success, Lord\r\nPalmerston took the matter in hand exactly at the right time. It may be\r\nthat Aberdeen had failed because he was Aberdeen, and Palmerston\r\nsucceeded because he was Palmerston, each by such lights and gifts as\r\nwere in him. That was, and still is, the average Englishman’s idea. Or\r\nit may be that Palmerston, with his usual luck, stepped in just when the\r\nevil days were over and success was becoming possible. That is the idea\r\nof clever critics of affairs. Who shall say which was correct?\r\n\r\nWe must go back here, and in the slightest possible manner touch upon\r\nthe causes of the great war. They had had their beginning while Lord\r\nPalmerston was at the Foreign Office, even if they be not said to have\r\ncommenced earlier than that. The nominal cause was a dispute which grew\r\nup in Jerusalem between the Latin and the Greek Churches for possession\r\nof the highest authority over the Holy Places. It was acknowledged that\r\nthe Holy Places should be open to both, but it was considered essential\r\nthat one should be supreme. It need hardly be said that with this\r\ncontest England had no personal concern. It was settled at last by the\r\nperplexed Turk on the advice of the English Ambassador. But it was so\r\nsettled as to make Nicholas, the Emperor of Russia, more convinced than\r\never of the general necessity of taking all the members of the Greek\r\nChurch in Turkey especially under his protection. This he attempted to\r\ndo in the fulness of autocratic authority. Then, when demur was made to\r\nthe Emperor’s claim, Count Mentschikoff was sent across the Pruth so as\r\nto occupy the Danubian Principalities, which, as far as this transaction\r\nwas concerned, were at the time a part of Turkey. All Europe at once\r\nwent to work to induce him to return. England, France, Austria, and\r\nPrussia, at any rate, did so. But Nicholas, who had long been busy and\r\ngreedy over the chattels of the “sick man,” would not retire without\r\nachieving something. And Turkey, thoroughly supported by that famous\r\nEnglishman, Sir Stratford Canning,--who had now become Lord Stratford de\r\nRedcliffe,--would grant him nothing in the way of a protectorate. A\r\nconference met at Vienna, with a pundit from each of the four countries,\r\nto save Turkey, and at the same time to save if possible the feelings\r\nand the honour of the Czar. But the attempt came to nothing, and was at\r\nlast altogether abortive.\r\n\r\nMr. Kinglake seems to attribute to Lord Palmerston almost more than a\r\nfriendly compliance with Napoleon in this matter. “There was not,\r\nperhaps, more than one member of the English Cabinet who desired the\r\nformation of this singular alliance on grounds like those which moved\r\nthe French Emperor.” We presume that Lord Palmerston was the Cabinet\r\nMinister here indicated. Again he says; “Of the bulk of the Cabinet, and\r\npossibly of all of them except one, Lord Clarendon’s pithy phrase was\r\nthe true one. They drifted” (vol. i. p. 440). Napoleon probably was\r\nanxious to obtain for himself the _éclat_ of going to war with Queen\r\nVictoria for his ally. For a man who had obtained his empire as he had\r\ndone it was a great thing to appear before the world with such a\r\nSovereign for his friend. We can understand that in fighting Russia he\r\nshould be actuated by such a motive. But the Coup d’Etat had taken place\r\nin the winter of 1851-1852, and the pundits were at their work of peace\r\nin Vienna during the summer of 1853. The dates do not hold good for the\r\ncontinuance of such a project on the part of Napoleon. It might have\r\nserved for three months to keep his throne, but could hardly have been\r\nserviceable after fifteen. We do know that Lord Aberdeen was weak,\r\ndoing his best to stave off war if he could do so. And we know also that\r\nPalmerston was strong, anxious from the beginning to act in accordance\r\nwith the English Ambassador at Constantinople. But we doubt whether\r\nthere be reason to suppose that he had lent himself to the wishes of the\r\nEmperor of the French, or desired to go beyond his own Ambassador.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the whole character of the man through a long life, we\r\nfind that his fault has been that of confident,--almost that of\r\nself-opinionated audacity. Having the advantage of his private\r\ncorrespondence,--which had not been revealed to Mr. Kinglake when his\r\nfirst volumes were published,--we can read in it no trace of such\r\nfriendship, or, we may say, of such anti-British feeling. He was ready\r\nto fight any man who was not an Englishman for any point,--and any man\r\nwho was an Englishman who opposed him, as long as he had a leg to stand\r\nupon. I am inclined, therefore, to think that Palmerston, in his\r\nreadiness for war with Russia, was in no degree guided by imperial\r\nsympathies. In July he wrote as follows to Lord Aberdeen; “I quite agree\r\nwith you that we ought to try whether we can devise any proposal which,\r\nwithout involving any departure by the Sultan from the ground of\r\nindependence on which he has taken his stand, might satisfy any just\r\nclaim which the Emperor can put forward. In the meantime, however, I\r\nhope you will allow the squadrons to be ordered to go up to the\r\nBosphorus as soon as it is known in Constantinople that the Russians\r\nhave entered the Principalities, and to be further at liberty to go into\r\nthe Black Sea, if necessary or useful for the protection of Turkish\r\nterritory.” And he ends his letter as follows; “I am confident that this\r\ncountry expects that we should pursue such a course, and I cannot\r\nbelieve that we should receive anything but support in pursuing it from\r\nthe party in Opposition.” Then he writes to Lord John Russell; “In my\r\nopinion, the course which the Emperor”--the Emperor of Russia,--“has\r\npursued on these matters from his first overtures for a partition of\r\nTurkey, and especially the violent, abusive, and menacing language of\r\nhis last manifesto, seem to show that he has taken his line, and that\r\nnothing will satisfy him but complete submission on the part of Turkey;\r\nand we ought, therefore, not to disguise from ourselves that he is bent\r\nupon a stand-up fight.”\r\n\r\n“I tried again to persuade the Cabinet to send the squadrons up to the\r\nBosphorus, but failed; I was told that Stratford and La Cour have powers\r\nto call for them. This is, no doubt, stated in public despatches, but we\r\nall know that he has been privately desired not to do so. Words may\r\nproperly be answered by words, but acts should be replied to by acts;\r\nand the entrance of the Russians as invaders into the Turkish territory\r\nought to be followed and replied to by the entrance of the squadrons\r\ninto the Bosphorus as protectors.” Here Palmerston seems to speak with\r\nhis wonted voice. It was as though the foreign affairs of England were\r\nall but under his control. It may be that he and the Emperor of the\r\nFrench were of one mind. Or it may be that the Emperor, knowing which\r\nway Palmerston was inclined to lead, foresaw that he could best play his\r\nown part by walking with him. But of the two men we think it probable\r\nthat Lord Palmerston knew Eastern Europe the better, and had the clearer\r\nidea of what he intended to do. Still in July, he writes thus to the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet; “The Russian Government has been led on step by\r\nstep by the apparent timidity of the Government of England; and\r\nreports, artfully propagated that the British Cabinet had declared that\r\nit would have _la paix à tout prix_, have not been sufficiently\r\ncontradicted by any overt acts.” But Lord Aberdeen was instinctively\r\nagainst the war into which, as Lord Clarendon afterwards said, England\r\nhad drifted, and Lord Clarendon, who had become Foreign Secretary,\r\nagreed with Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the Emperor Nicholas was thoroughly convinced\r\nthat England, and especially England under the guidance of Lord\r\nAberdeen, would not allow herself to be driven into war. He read the\r\nspeeches in the House of Commons, and probably counted even the votes.\r\nTo the English money-making commercial mind, war he conceived to be of\r\nall things the most antipathetic. Looking forward as well as his\r\nintellect would allow him, he thought he saw that the British power was\r\nin her decline. Sir Stratford Canning and Lord Palmerston he had always\r\nhated. They were two special foes; but they were only two. All England,\r\nwith her bales of cotton, would certainly not go to war. Such was the\r\nconviction of the Emperor Nicholas. And, since Lord Aberdeen had come\r\ninto power at the preceding Christmas, such also had been the tendency\r\nof the English Prime Minister’s mind. But the will of Lord\r\nPalmerston,--and the will also of the Emperor of the French,--had been\r\nstronger than that of Lord Aberdeen. Very much in compliance with\r\nPalmerston’s instructions, the two fleets did pass up the Dardanelles on\r\nthe 14th of October, and were brought to an anchor immediately off\r\nConstantinople. The two Lords in the English Cabinet were still hardly\r\nacting in concert, though Lord Aberdeen’s nature was so gracious as to\r\nmake actual opposition to his colleague almost impossible. He, too, had\r\nat his back the Prince Consort, who, though he agreed to war under\r\ncertain circumstances, was not of one mind with Lord Palmerston as to\r\nwhat those circumstances were.[K] Lord Palmerston defines his ideas in\r\nthe following words; “We passed the Rubicon when we first took part with\r\nTurkey, and sent our squadrons to support her; and when England and\r\nFrance have once taken a third Power by the hand, that third Power must\r\nbe carried in safety through the difficulties in which it may be\r\ninvolved. England and France cannot afford to be baffled, and whatever\r\nmeasures may be necessary on their part to baffle their opponent, those\r\nmeasures must be adopted; and the Governments of the two most powerful\r\ncountries on the face of the earth must not be frightened, either by\r\nwords or things, either by the name or by the reality of war.” That was\r\ndated on the 1st of November, hardly a clear month before Sinope, and\r\nindicates what were then his intentions.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleets had passed up the Dardanelles, the anger of Nicholas was\r\nvery great. He had never thought that by crossing the Pruth he had given\r\na _casus belli_; and as without such provocation the passage of the\r\nfleets up to Constantinople would have been an infraction of a\r\nwell-understood treaty, he considered himself to have been grossly\r\ninsulted and misused. Was it the fact that these English did intend to\r\nfight him? He was a Sovereign who had made awful preparations for war,\r\nand he was aware that the English army was, in these latter days, always\r\nmaintained on a peace-footing,--what to him must have appeared a cheap\r\nand nasty military arrangement. If these English attempted to follow up\r\ntheir fleet, he would let them feel the weight of his right hand. But it\r\nwas incumbent on him, at any rate, to punish the Turks. Therefore he\r\nsent his own fleet out from Sebastopol, and arranged matters for Sinope.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that during this time Lord Palmerston was\r\nSecretary of State for Home Affairs, and was by no means specially\r\ncalled upon to attend to this Russo-Turkish question. He had his smoke\r\nand his cemeteries, and his factories and his law courts, to look\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR;--PALMERSTON PRIME MINISTER, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war began in earnest with the naval conflict at Sinope. It was a\r\nterrible deed, and done, we must say, altogether in revenge. The English\r\nand French fleets had gone up the Dardanelles, and by doing so had\r\noffended the proud nature of Nicholas past all immediate forgiveness.\r\nThe Russian ships came out from Sebastopol, and, after hovering about\r\nthe Black Sea for a fortnight, to see, probably, whether the combined\r\nfleet would interfere, and finding that the small Turkish squadron lying\r\nat Sinope was at their mercy, went in and destroyed it altogether. “It\r\nwas believed by men in authority,” says Mr. Kinglake, “that 4,000 Turks\r\nwere killed, and that less than 400 survived, and that all these were\r\nwounded.”[L]\r\n\r\nEngland was full of wrath, and nothing would appease her anger but a\r\nconviction that now, let the Prime Minister say what he would, we should\r\nfight Russia. Looking back on the circumstance over many years, we must\r\nacknowledge that the Emperor of Russia had on his side any legal rights\r\nwhich a state of war can give. He, out of his own mad sense of power,\r\nhad crossed the Pruth, and we,--the French, that is, and\r\nourselves,--had on the part of our allies taken our fleets up to\r\nConstantinople. The Russians had returned back across the Pruth; but\r\nNicholas refused to say that he would give up his idea of a\r\nprotectorate. The allies had therefore gone with their fleets into the\r\nBlack Sea, and there could be no doubt that a state of war existed. But\r\nthe Russian Admiral had six or seven ships of the line on the spot,\r\nwhereas the Turks had but seven frigates. There was no hope for them,\r\nbut still they fought bravely while they had a gun to fight, and\r\nperished at last almost to a man. Our fleet, the meanwhile, was lying at\r\nthe Bosphorus, and all England was angry. Nothing but war could now\r\nserve to quiet the minds of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, 1853, Lord Palmerston wrote to the Prime\r\nMinister, recommending that we in England should at once prepare to\r\nfight;--“What I would strongly recommend, therefore, is that which I\r\nproposed some months ago to the Cabinet, namely, that the Russian\r\nGovernment and the Russian Admiral at Sebastopol should be informed that\r\nso long as Russian troops occupy the Principalities, or hold a position\r\nin any other part of the Turkish territory, no Russian ships of war can\r\nbe allowed to show themselves out of port in the Black Sea.” Lord\r\nAberdeen declined the advice thus given, and on the 15th Lord Palmerston\r\nresigned. But the Government could not go on without him. “In truth,”\r\nsays Mr. Kinglake, “he was gifted with the instinct which enables a man\r\nto read the heart of a nation.”[M] He was no sooner gone than the\r\nCabinet in his absence did decide upon sending the fleet into the Black\r\nSea; and then the resignation was withdrawn. Lord Aberdeen wrote to him\r\nas follows;--“I am glad to find that you approve of a recent decision\r\nof the Cabinet with respect to the British and French fleets, adopted in\r\nyour absence. I feel sure you will have learnt with pleasure that,\r\nwhether you are absent or present, the Government are duly careful to\r\npreserve from all injury the interests and dignity of the country.” On\r\nthe 7th of February the Russian Ambassador was recalled, and troops were\r\nimmediately sent to the East. Then there was a dinner given to Sir\r\nCharles Napier at the Reform Club, for which Lord Palmerston was held to\r\nbe specially responsible. It was not, perhaps, done in the best taste or\r\nwith the most correct judgment. A triumphant banquet to a conquering\r\nhero should follow, and not precede, the victories to be celebrated.\r\nLord Palmerston presided, and was very triumphant and very jocund. He\r\ntold stories of all that the Admiral had done in the Mediterranean and\r\nelsewhere, and suggested all that he would do in the Baltic. Mr. Bright\r\nfell very foul of him, and perhaps deservedly. Lord Palmerston retorted\r\non Mr. Bright with severity, and a considerable amount of ill-feeling\r\nwas engendered. Mr. Bright belonged then, as now, to the Peace party,\r\nand found an ample scope for attack in the loud joy of a Minister who\r\nwas exciting his fellow-countrymen to war; and, undoubtedly, he had the\r\nbest of it in the end, as Sir Charles did not return triumphant.\r\n\r\nThe British troops now flocked into Turkey, and the transit across from\r\nVarna to the Crimean Peninsula was quickly achieved. On the 14th of\r\nSeptember the first detachments of the English and French armies landed,\r\nand a few days later the battle of the Alma was fought and won. We can\r\nstill remember the feeling of triumph with which the news was heard, and\r\nthe spirit of conquest which was enhanced by the false tidings,\r\nbelieved at the time, that Sebastopol also had fallen. England did think\r\nfor a few hours that she had already done that which was to cost her\r\ntwelve months of heart-rending anxieties, many millions of taxes, and\r\nwoe beyond measure. Hitherto, as we have read the records of the\r\npreparations for the campaign, it has appeared that Lord Palmerston, as\r\nHome Secretary, has had more to do with the war than any other Minister.\r\nBut he escaped the personal annoyance to which those were subjected who\r\nhad the management of the details in their hands, and who were supposed\r\nto be responsible for what was amiss. But the time was soon to come in\r\nwhich he would cease to be an underling;--and then, such was his luck,\r\nall things went well.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of the Alma things did not go prosperously. England,\r\nwhen she was brought back from the feeling of triumph which had almost\r\noverpowered her on the false report of the fall of Sebastopol, expected\r\nthat though the stronghold had not yet fallen into her hands, it should\r\nbe made to do so very quickly. She was unreasonable in the severity with\r\nwhich she treated her servants, both civil and military, at home and in\r\nthe Crimea. England, not being accustomed to war on a great scale for\r\nthe last forty years, could not at first carry it on as though she were\r\nused to it, and accused all her servants of “routine,” “red tape,”\r\nblundering, and ignorance. We can look back now and see that such were\r\nthe charges made by the austere mistress, and remember the names of Lord\r\nRaglan and the Duke of Newcastle with affection and respect, though we\r\nbroke the heart of the one and the spirit of the other by our usage. But\r\nif the servants are noble-minded, as is generally the case with English\r\nservants in high places, even when broken-hearted, they leave examples\r\nbehind them which instigate others to renewed efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings of failures came Lord John Russell was himself the\r\nfirst to declare that his own colleague at the War Department was unfit\r\nfor his position. That colleague was the unfortunate Duke of Newcastle,\r\nand Lord John recommended that “before Parliament meets Lord Palmerston\r\nshould be entrusted with the seals of the War Department.” Lord\r\nAberdeen, however, declined to dismiss the Duke of Newcastle, and then\r\nMr. Roebuck moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire\r\ninto the condition of our army. Lord John immediately resigned, by no\r\nmeans with the good-will of his colleagues. Lord John had been leader of\r\nthe House, and on his desertion the defence of Lord Aberdeen and of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle was left to Lord Palmerston. He said, which was true\r\nenough, that our misfortunes had come from the inexperience caused by a\r\nlong peace. The House divided on Mr. Roebuck’s motion, and the Ministry\r\nwere defeated by a great majority. It was found that 305 members\r\nfollowed Mr. Roebuck into the lobby against only 148, who supported the\r\nGovernment. It was clear, at any rate, that Lord Aberdeen must resign.\r\n\r\nBut though Lord Palmerston must resign also with his chief, and appeared\r\nfor the time as the second in command of a beaten army, it was to him a\r\nmoment of great triumph. There was no longer a question whether he\r\nshould again serve under Lord John or with Lord John, or whether he\r\nshould be compelled on behalf of his country to serve under one whose\r\ngeneral politics were so distasteful to him as those of Lord Aberdeen.\r\nLord Derby was at once invited to form a Government,--but in vain. He\r\napplied to Lord Palmerston to help him; but it was not thus, we can\r\nfancy, that Lord Palmerston saw his way through the future troubles.\r\nLord Derby could well understand that if he were to be a successful\r\nPrime Minister in a War Cabinet, he must have Lord Palmerston as his\r\nright-hand man. But it was not so long since this same Lord Derby, then\r\nLord Stanley, had brought against him in the House of Lords the\r\nbitterness of the Don Pacifico arraignment. It was not that this would\r\nhave stood in Palmerston’s way, had it been possible for him to have\r\nthrown his heart into the work in conjunction with Lord Derby. But such\r\na conjunction cannot be always attained by mere volition. Political\r\ncoalitions are never firm, because they are formed of individual men,\r\nand each man has a heart in his bosom in which he carries his memories\r\nof the past as well as his hopes for the future. “I have come to the\r\nconclusion,” he said, “that if I were to join your Government, as\r\nproposed by you, I should not give to that Government that strength\r\nwhich you are good enough to think would accrue to you from my\r\nacceptance of office.” Lord John was then sent for, and made the\r\nattempt. Lord Clarendon and others of the party would not serve with\r\nhim, though Lord Palmerston had consented to do so. Lord John, in\r\ntelling Lord Palmerston of his failure, offered to serve with him,\r\nshould the Queen require his services. There was no other alternative.\r\nIndeed there was no other man than Lord Palmerston in England who could\r\nhave carried on the war. The Queen sent for him, and Lord John did join\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n    “ ... Quod optanti Divûm promittere nemo\r\n     Auderet, volvenda dies en attulit ultro.”\r\n\r\nIt was thus he signified his final triumph to his brother,--or intended\r\nso to signify it, but quoted the passage wrongly.\r\n\r\nThere is in this a boyish feeling of the happiness of success. And yet\r\nhe was seventy years old. We cannot fancy such an expression coming from\r\nLord John or Lord Aberdeen. Though either had felt it, he could not have\r\nso written to his brother. Here I am at last,--Prime Minister of\r\nEngland, in spite of all accidents. My old friend, Lord John, turned me\r\nout of the Foreign Office the other day. And I was obliged to go at his\r\nbidding. And I had a bad quarter of an hour in the House of Commons\r\nwhen, for reasons which are always paramount with an Englishman, I was\r\nunable to take my own part. They said I was crushed. “There was a\r\nPalmerston.” But when these times of war had come, I was wanted, And now\r\nmy Lord John is my lieutenant. All that was not loudly expressed in the\r\n“volvenda dies en attulit ultro;” but it was understood both by the\r\nwriter and by his brother. And he goes on: “Here am I, writing to you\r\nfrom Downing Street as First Lord of the Treasury. The fact was, that\r\nAberdeen and Newcastle had become discredited in public estimation as\r\nStatesmen equal to the emergency; Derby felt conscious of the incapacity\r\nof the greater portion of his party, and their unfitness to govern the\r\ncountry; and John Russell, by the way in which he suddenly abandoned the\r\nGovernment, had so lost caste for the moment that I was the only one of\r\nhis political friends who was willing to serve under him.” “I think our\r\nGovernment will do very well. I am backed by the general opinion of the\r\nwhole country, and I have no reason to complain of the least want of\r\ncordiality or confidence on the part of the Court.” Lord Aberdeen had\r\nhimself done his best to make the matter easy for Lord Palmerston. I\r\nquote the following words from the “Life of the Prince Consort” (vol.\r\niii. p. 209);--“Lord Palmerston had good reason to appreciate the\r\ngenerosity with which his old chief had interposed to remove this\r\nformidable impediment to his success.” Nor was Her Majesty less\r\ngrateful; and in her letter, 6th of February, announcing to Lord\r\nAberdeen that Lord Palmerston had just kissed hands upon his appointment\r\nas Premier, she told him that she was now relieved from great anxiety\r\nand difficulty, and felt that she owed much to Lord Aberdeen’s kind and\r\ndisinterested assistance. Then he states the terms which he intends to\r\npropose to the enemy, and in doing so prophesies the future almost\r\nexactly. “We must also _ask_ for the destruction of the works at\r\nSebastopol, although we should not make that a _sine quâ non_ unless we\r\nhad taken the place and had destroyed the works ourselves.”\r\n\r\nA majority of the House of Commons, led by Mr. Roebuck, and with the\r\npeople of the country to back them, insisted on inquiry, on punishment,\r\non improvement, and increased activity. We still remember how “red tape”\r\nand “routine” were in all our mouths. Mail after mail brought home news\r\nof increased suffering. Palmerston had become Prime Minister in\r\nFebruary, 1855, and it was during the winter then drawing to its close\r\nthat the sufferings and struggles of the Army had been most intense.\r\nBalaclava had been fought in October; the battle of Mount Inkerman in\r\nNovember; the great storm was on the 14th of that month; and, as the\r\nwinter wore on, tidings of the difficulties of transit from Balaclava to\r\nthe heights reached us,--and at last the road was made. It was in the\r\nmiddle of all these difficulties that Palmerston had become Prime\r\nMinister, and that Mr. Roebuck urged on his committee. Sir James Graham,\r\nMr. Gladstone, and Mr. Sydney Herbert then retired; but others came in\r\ntheir places, and Lord Palmerston still went on; and during all the\r\nmisery of the time,--for England was miserable with the sense of\r\nfailure, or, at least, of performance not perfected,--he never quailed,\r\nor expressed any diffidence as to the work to which he had been called.\r\nIt was the nature of the man not to be diffident, and therefore he\r\nsucceeded. His courage was coarse and strong and indomitable, like that\r\nof a dog. We should say that he never trembled, even when he laid his\r\nhead upon his pillow, because of the task imposed upon him. He would go\r\non, having England at his back, and did not doubt but that the country\r\nwould be found standing on its legs when the struggle should come to an\r\nend. I do not know that there was any one concerned in the matter whose\r\nheart was exactly of the same calibre. It was the very type of health,\r\nunadorned,--as also unalloyed,--by romance or high feeling, or poetry,\r\nor even sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these things, in the early spring, the Emperor Nicholas\r\ndied,--died broken-hearted, a victim to his own pride; but the contest\r\nwent on the same as ever.\r\n\r\nA second conference, to which Lord John went on the part of England, was\r\nheld at Vienna, to arrange, if possible, the terms of peace, and to fix\r\nthe four principal headings,--the condition of the Principalities, the\r\nnavigation of the Danube, the power which Russia was to assume, or not\r\nto assume, in the Black Sea, and the independence of the Porte. In his\r\noperations there Lord John was held by the country to have failed.\r\nIndeed, he had never really succeeded in any political effort since the\r\nday on which he had ventured to dismiss Lord Palmerston. And yet Lord\r\nPalmerston had been true to him. Lord Palmerston had never opposed him\r\nsince the great blow by which he had turned him out on the Militia Bill.\r\nIn truth, the people had not been with him, and had ceased to trust him.\r\nBut to the other man the people had been true throughout. Lord\r\nPalmerston had no capability for thought equal to that of which Lord\r\nJohn was the master; but he possessed an instinctive sympathy with the\r\nmasses which supported him to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nThe Vienna Conference was broken up, but the war still was carried on,\r\ncertainly with the most exemplary care on the part of the septuagenarian\r\nPrime Minister. He writes as follows to Lord Panmure, the Minister for\r\nWar;--“This is capital news from the Sea of Azoff, and the extensive\r\ndestruction of magazines and supplies in the towns attacked must greatly\r\ncripple the Russian army in the Crimea. I am very sorry, however, to see\r\nso sad an account of the health of the Sardinians, and I strongly\r\nrecommend you to urge Raglan, by telegraph to-day, to move the Sardinian\r\ncamp to some other and healthier situation. Such prevalence of disease\r\nas the telegraphic message mentions must be the effect of some local\r\ncause.” “As the cholera seems to be increasing among the troops, I\r\nshould advise you to send for the doctor I mentioned.” “We are 40,000\r\nmen short of the number voted by Parliament, and we shall be without the\r\nshadow of an excuse if we do not resort to every possible means and\r\nevery possible quarter to complete our force to the number which\r\nParliament has authorized.” “Do not forget to suggest to our\r\ncommissariat people in the Black Sea that large supplies of oxen to be\r\neaten, and of horses to be ridden and to draw, may be derived from the\r\ncountry on the eastern shore of the Sea of Azoff.” “It would be well\r\nalso to point their attention to the projecting neck of land or island\r\ncalled Krassnoi, in the Bay of Perekop, which is said to abound in sheep\r\nand hay.” From these quotations it will be seen how sleepless was his\r\nwatchfulness, and how minute his attentions to the affairs of the war.\r\nHe writes to his brother in August of the same year, and speaks of the\r\nprobable fall of Sebastopol. “Our danger will then begin--a danger of\r\npeace, and not a danger of war.” “I must try to fight the battle of\r\nnegotiation as well as the battle of war, and, fortunately, the spirit\r\nof the English nation will support us. I wish I could reckon with equal\r\nconfidence on the steady determination of the French.”\r\n\r\nIn September Sebastopol had fallen, and the difficulties did in truth\r\nbegin. He had now to contend not only with Russia, but with Austria and\r\nalso with France. It is said of course that his spirit of contention was\r\nsimply interference, and that in all things he wrote and spoke as a\r\nbully. It is difficult indeed to defend his manner; but that which he\r\ndesired to get, he desired honestly. He desired it always on behalf of\r\nhis country, and he usually got it. He writes as follows in January,\r\n1856, to our Ambassador at Vienna;--“My dear Seymour,--Buol’s statement\r\nto you the night before last was what, in plain English, we should call\r\nimpertinent. We are happily not yet in such a condition that an Austrian\r\nminister should bid us sign a treaty without hesitation or conditions.\r\nThe Cabinet of Vienna, forsooth, must insist upon our doing so! Why,\r\nreally our friend Buol must have had his head turned by his success at\r\nSt. Petersburg, and quite forgot whom he was addressing such language\r\nto.” “We know the exhaustion, the internal pressure, difficulties, and\r\ndistress of Russia quite as well as Buol does; but we know better than\r\nhe does our own resources and strength. He may rest assured, however,\r\nthat we have no wish to continue the war for the prospect of what we may\r\naccomplish another year, if we can now obtain peace upon the conditions\r\nwhich we deem absolutely necessary and essential; but we are quite\r\nprepared to go on if such conditions cannot be obtained. The British\r\nnation is unanimous in this matter. I say unanimous, for I cannot reckon\r\nCobden, Bright, and Co. for anything.” And he was right. The British\r\nnation did support him, and, in spite of Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright,\r\nwould have supported no minister who had acted otherwise. The Emperor of\r\nthe French, now that the war was over,--now rather when it was possible\r\nto bring it to an end,--was desirous of softening the terms for Russia.\r\nBut England was not specially desirous,--was not in a hurry. England was\r\nbetter able to continue the fight than she had been to begin it, and was\r\nby no means willing to give up any of those points for which she had\r\nexpended her blood and her money. It had cost her fifty millions and\r\n25,000 men. Having paid so dearly for her whistle, she was determined to\r\nhave as much of it as might be possible. Therefore it must, I think, be\r\nadmitted, that Lord Palmerston, in his arrogance, showed no more than\r\nthe concentrated essence of an Englishman. It may be said that the\r\nfeeling of the country was bulldog, turbulent, arrogant, and headstrong;\r\nbut it was honest, and in all that it did it was guided by the feeling\r\nthat each man should have that which was properly his own.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain in such a memoir as this to go back to the question of\r\nthe right or wrong of the Crimean War. Lord Clarendon wittily declared\r\nthat we had “drifted” into it. The word has been considered happy, and,\r\nsince our passion on the subject has been over, has been used\r\nextensively to indicate our own folly in the matter. But if we had not\r\ngone to war, together with our French allies, would not Nicholas have\r\nbeen allowed to drift into Constantinople? It has been one of the chief\r\nefforts of Europe in the present century to restrain the ambition of the\r\nCzar of Russia. Whether this has or has not been a wise desire need not\r\nbe discussed here. But it will, I think, be admitted, that when the\r\nEmperor’s troops had crossed the Pruth and occupied a position on\r\nTurkish territory, they would not have receded without doing something\r\non their master’s behalf--unless they had been made to do so. Lord\r\nAberdeen had thought that they could be made to go back by the force of\r\nargument. And the Czar had thought that he need not go back without\r\ngaining some portion of his road to Constantinople, because Lord\r\nAberdeen’s thoughts had been of so peaceful a nature. Therefore Lord\r\nPalmerston was put into Lord Aberdeen’s place, and the Czar had to go\r\nback--with terrible consequences to himself. How it might have ended had\r\nthe English people been less turbulent and headstrong, it would require\r\na wise man to say. But had not Palmerston been there to their hand, some\r\nother Prime Minister would have been found to do the work, and to do it\r\nprobably with less skill in the management.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of England with regard to Turkey, and also in regard to\r\nRussia, have changed since the Crimean War. And there has been reason\r\nfor the change. At that time it had been the intention of the Emperor\r\nNicholas gradually to swallow the Sultan’s dominions,--to swallow them,\r\nor to have them swallowed by some other confederate and hungry animal.\r\nWe all remember, as though it were yesterday, the proposal for the\r\npartition of the sick man’s goods. The suggestion did not suit us. But\r\nas we would have none of these goods for ourselves, neither would we\r\npermit another to take them. We felt that for us Russia would be a more\r\ndangerous occupant of the Eastern Mediterranean than Turkey. And though\r\nwe thought but little of the Mahommedan, we thought almost less of the\r\nRussian Christian. It was, at any rate, indispensable for our purposes\r\nthat the Turk should be maintained. The half of the population of Turkey\r\nin Europe were Christians, whom we thought to be as near to civilization\r\nas the Muscovite from further North; and we flattered ourselves that it\r\nmight be possible for us to teach them and their Mahommedan compatriots\r\nsome touch of better manners. With the Russian we conceived that we\r\ncould do nothing. There was much of mistaken vanity in this, because we\r\nhad told ourselves that this people, thoroughly averse to us in customs,\r\nmight be tamed and reduced and made like ourselves by the execution of a\r\nfew treaties and the loan of a good deal of money. They took our money,\r\nand increased their harems, and laughed at our treaties. But still we\r\nhad gained our object in this, that the Turk and not the Russian owned,\r\nand was likely to own, Constantinople. We had beaten back the Russian,\r\nto whom, though we did not begrudge him the power to increase his\r\nborders in Asia,--except in our own special direction,--we did refuse\r\nany advance in Europe. With these ideas, and on this theory, we went to\r\nwar, and as we were by treaty the joint protectors of Turkey, the war\r\nwas surely justifiable. Whether we got a good investment for our fifty\r\nmillions, and, also, for our 25,000 English lives, is a question which\r\nwe cannot now settle. The way in which it is settled by each individual\r\ndepends on his own occupation in life. Does he breed cattle, or does he\r\nmake carpets?\r\n\r\nBut in the quarter of a century which has passed since the Crimean War\r\nthe Turk has done very much to make the blood of an Englishman boil. We\r\nlent him money on the promise of certain performances. He has spent our\r\nmoney, but has performed none of his promises. We have called upon him\r\nagain and again to reform, and he has replied by expressing his desire\r\nfor more money. He has done nothing to change his habits, and has only\r\nproved to us that a Mahommedan Turk cannot become a good Christian.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the man for whom we expended 25,000 lives in war and fifty\r\nmillions in war expenses, for which we have no claim on any one,--and\r\nmany other millions in loans, as to which it would be better for our\r\npeace of mind if also we had no claim! The Mahommedan must certainly be\r\nmade to go out of Europe, but it must be by slow degrees, and not at the\r\ninstance of a despotic Emperor, who, under the name of a religious\r\nprotectorate, would take possession of the country. Let any one who is\r\nstill unhappy on the score of Turkey take the modern map of Europe, and\r\ncompare the lines as they are drawn now and as they were drawn sixty\r\nyears ago. He will see that the banishment of the Turk has not been so\r\nvery slow.\r\n\r\nNot, therefore, from dislike to Turkish rule should the English reader\r\ndecide that the war into which he will have been told we had drifted,\r\nwas inexpedient or more expensive than has been justified by the objects\r\nattained. That war was essentially one of Lord Palmerston’s making. He\r\nadvised it, commenced it, carried it on, and completed it. His\r\nhand--instant, urgent, and pressing--is to be seen in it throughout. We\r\ncannot yet say that it was all wise. It may well be that the world shall\r\nnever be able to say with any certainty whether it was wise or foolish;\r\nbut as far as the world has gone yet, no verdict has been given against\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN MUTINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, 1856, at the Court at Buckingham Palace, Lord\r\nPalmerston was made a Knight of the Garter, it being understood that\r\nthis was done in recognition of his services in reference to the Crimean\r\nWar. When we remember what had occurred a few years back as to his\r\ndismissal from the Foreign Office, we may allow that he was bound to\r\naccept this token of her Majesty’s favour. Lord Melbourne is reported to\r\nhave said some years earlier, when a similar opportunity had come to\r\nhim, that he had no need to bribe himself;--and he died without having\r\nK.G. written after his name. It is probable that no such word was used\r\nby Lord Melbourne, and that the cynical phrase was one merely made to\r\nsuit the occasion. But there was a truth in it which took hold of men.\r\nThere is, perhaps, a feeling that, as the Prime Minister is supposed to\r\nrecommend the recipients of this honour for Her Majesty’s acceptance,\r\nPalmerston would not now stand lower in the world’s esteem had he\r\ndeclined it. Lord Fortescue, who was installed on the same day, could\r\nwell afford to accept the blue ribbon. There was a reason why Lord\r\nPalmerston should accept it. But had he not done so, there would have\r\nbeen an increased glory in going to his rest, as Lord Melbourne had\r\ndone, without burdening his name with the additional title.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1856, when Lord Palmerston was surrounded by the difficulties\r\nincident to the completion of the war, he lost his only brother; and\r\nwith him those letters came to an end, which give us the freest account\r\nof Lord Palmerston’s thoughts, his ambition, his arrogance, and his\r\njustice. We do not hear a word from him afterwards about his brother. He\r\nmight have been the merest casual friend, chance-selected for some\r\nsmaller embassy. For his elder brother had never pushed him up to the\r\nhigher places at Paris, Constantinople, Vienna, or St. Petersburg. Sir\r\nWilliam Temple had probably lacked something either in intellect or\r\nenergy, or perhaps in discretion, of that fitness for the duties of an\r\nambassador which had been found in Lord Granville, Sir Stratford\r\nCanning, and Sir Hamilton Seymour. At any rate Lord Palmerston was\r\ndetermined that he would not be accused of nepotism. In expressions of\r\ngrief there is somewhat of feminine feeling, which, to the nature of\r\nLord Palmerston, was antipathetic. His brother had lived at Naples for\r\nmany years, our Minister at a third-rate Court. Now he had come home and\r\ndied, and, as far as Lord Palmerston’s outside life was concerned, there\r\nwas an end of him.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Session of 1857 there sprang up a difficulty in China in\r\nreference to a small ship which has ever since been known as the lorcha\r\n_Arrow_. The _Arrow_, on a charge of piracy, was boarded by certain\r\nChinese from a war junk, and Sir John Bowring, who was our Governor at\r\nHong-Kong, demanded reparation from Commissioner Yeh. Then arose a\r\nquarrel and a fight, in which, of course, the English got the better.\r\nThe matter, which was of importance at the time, has by lapse of years\r\nbecome so trivial as to be hardly worthy of notice here,--but that it\r\nled to a dissolution of Parliament. A motion was brought forward in the\r\nHouse of Lords by Lord Derby, blaming the Government, and was carried by\r\na majority of thirty-six. Mr. Cobden brought a similar motion before the\r\nHouse of Commons, and was supported by Mr. Disraeli, Lord John Russell,\r\nSir James Graham, and Mr. Gladstone. Mr. Disraeli twitted Lord\r\nPalmerston with having made his complaint to the country, and bade him\r\nfollow his complaint by an appeal. The motion was carried by a majority\r\nof sixteen against the Government, and Lord Palmerston did appeal.\r\n\r\nThat Lord Palmerston, as Prime Minister, should have been distasteful to\r\nMr. Cobden and Mr. Gladstone we can understand. He was essentially a War\r\nMinister, and had latterly dealt with war alone. To Mr. Cobden and Mr.\r\nGladstone he must have been the incarnation of insular aggression. But\r\nLord Derby and Sir James Graham, Lord John Russell and Mr. Disraeli,\r\ncould have entertained none of this feeling. They had shown themselves\r\nat least anxious to conduct the war, and we cannot imagine that the\r\nquestion of the lorcha _Arrow_ can have so operated upon them as to make\r\nthem feel it imperative for the sake of England’s glory to turn\r\ninstantly upon the man who had just brought England through her\r\ndifficulties. It was simply a party conflict, in which Aristides had\r\nbeen too just. But Aristides resolved that he would follow his enemies’\r\nadvice, and see what the country would say to it.\r\n\r\nHe must have known when he went to the country what would be the result.\r\nHe had just carried the war to a successful end, and the country would\r\nnot see him displaced. The normal Englishman was thoroughly proud of\r\nhim, proud of his bad jokes, proud of his unflinching energy, and proud\r\nof his years. He called his opponents, when they denied that they\r\ncombined together against him, “the fortuitous concourse of atoms.” The\r\njoke was better worth quoting than those he usually made. The country\r\nwas even proud of him because he stuck to Tiverton instead of accepting\r\na more glorious seat. To have deserted old friends in his glory, who had\r\nbeen true to him before his glory came, would not have been like\r\nPalmerston. So he got his majority in spite of the lorcha _Arrow_, and\r\nMr. Bright and Mr. Cobden were both excluded from the new Parliament.\r\n\r\nThen came upon us the Indian Mutiny; and men who had never doubted\r\nduring the Russian campaign, though they felt that England must strain\r\nevery nerve for victory, began to fear that the few who were there to\r\nbear the brunt must perish in the attempt. It was a common fear that if\r\nIndia was to belong to us for the future, India must be conquered a\r\nsecond time; and while men thought of this, their hearts fell within\r\nthem as they remembered what must be the fate of the British men, and\r\nchildren, and women, who were doomed to suffer things many times worse\r\nthan death. And there was a feeling by no means uncommon, and very\r\ndeadly, that India would be lost for ever, and with it all the glory of\r\nEngland. That this idea prevailed in France, which had just been our\r\nally, and in Russia, which had just been our enemy, and in the United\r\nStates, which of all nations was the nearest akin to us, cannot be\r\ndoubted. When men’s hearts are so heavy they show it in their faces\r\nrather than by their speech. There were months in 1857 when men in\r\nEngland hardly dared to speak aloud what they thought and felt about\r\nIndia. But of Lord Palmerston it must be said that he was made of some\r\nstronger and coarser fabric than other men, better prepared for hard\r\nwear, and able to bear without detriment rain and snow and dirty\r\nweather. Through that period of the Indian Mutiny,--which must have been\r\nharder, we think, for an English Prime Minister to bear even than the\r\ntemporary failures of the Crimea,--he never blanched.\r\n\r\nIt was said by the _Edinburgh Review_, just before the tidings of the\r\nMutiny reached us, that “the past Session found Lord Palmerston covered\r\nwith the glory of having trodden down the wine-press alone.” This was\r\nthe very pinnacle of the column of praise which was raised to his honour\r\non behalf of his steadfastness against Russia by those of the Press who\r\nsupported his side in politics. But it was true. He had done it alone.\r\nIf we look back we can find no other Minister who had not failed, or\r\nhesitated, or remained in the background. But yet we think that the\r\neffort made by him to suppress the Indian Mutiny was the greater of the\r\ntwo. It came easier to him because he had been made familiar with the\r\nefforts necessary for such work by the Russian war; and coming, as the\r\nMutiny did, close after the Russian war, and dealing with matters less\r\npalpably open to the mind’s eye than the Russian quarrel, it created,\r\nwith all its horrors and all its triumphs, a less abiding\r\nthoughtfulness. India had been ours, and must be ours. So we felt when\r\nIndia was again ours. But it had nearly come to pass that India, at any\r\nrate for the time, was not ours. But Palmerston went on governing the\r\ncountry through it all with apparent equanimity. In three months we had\r\nsent 30,000 troops to India, with all their horses, appurtenances,\r\nclothing, and armour. When we remember the distance, the rapidity\r\nrequired, the scattered positions of the men to be collected, and of the\r\ntransports needed, I think we may boast that no other country ever made\r\nsuch an effort.\r\n\r\nAfter all, much of the hardest fighting was done by the army stationary\r\nin India before the troops from England arrived. It would be unfair to\r\nsay even a few words about the mutiny without declaring this. Delhi had\r\nbeen taken from the mutineers. Outram, Havelock, the Lawrences, and\r\nInglis had done their work. When all were true and all were heroes,\r\nthere need be no jealousy of praise. But to Lord Canning, the son of\r\nPalmerston’s old tutor in politics, the Canning who had been so hard on\r\nPalmerston in the Don Pacifico debate, the Canning who had gone to India\r\nmost unwillingly in obedience to Palmerston’s commands, the Canning to\r\nhave said a word against whom required the self-annihilation of a\r\nMinister,[N] Canning who completed by his death his victory in the\r\ncountry he had been sent to govern,--to him and to those brave men whom\r\nthe Mutiny, bursting from its swarthy ranks, had found in India, the\r\nfirst praise for crushing it is due.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston in the Mansion House had to blow England’s trumpet in\r\naddressing the normal Mansion House audience. “An Englishman,” he said,\r\n“is not so fond as the people of some other countries are of uniforms,\r\nof steel scabbards, and of iron heels; but no nation can excel the\r\nEnglish, either as officers or soldiers, in knowledge of the duties of\r\nthe military profession, and in the zeal and ability with which those\r\nduties are performed; and whatever desperate deeds are to be\r\naccomplished,--wherever superior numbers are to be boldly encountered\r\nand triumphantly overcome--wherever privations are to be encountered,\r\nwherever that which a soldier has to confront is individually or\r\ncollectively to be found, there, I will venture to say, there is no\r\nnation on the face of the earth which can surpass,--I might, without too\r\nmuch national vanity, say, I believe there is no nation which can\r\nequal,--the people of the British islands. But, my Lord Mayor and\r\ngentlemen, while we all admire the bravery, the constancy, and the\r\nintrepidity of our countrymen in India, we must not forget to do justice\r\nalso to our countrywomen. In the ordinary course of life the functions\r\nof women are to cheer the days of adversity, to soothe the hours of\r\nsuffering, and to give additional brilliancy to the sunshine of\r\nprosperity; but our countrywomen in India have had occasion to show\r\nqualities of a higher and nobler kind, and when they have had either to\r\nsustain the perils of the siege, or endure the privations of a difficult\r\nescape, to forget their own sufferings in endeavouring to minister to\r\nthe wants of others, the women of the United Kingdom have, wherever they\r\nhave been found in India, displayed qualities of the noblest kind, such\r\nas have never been surpassed in the history of the world. Henceforth the\r\nbravest soldier may think it no disparagement to be told that his\r\ncourage and his power of endurance are equal to those of an\r\nEnglishwoman.”\r\n\r\nWe can hear the words of the old man now, and tell ourselves that this\r\nwas a moment in which national vanity might be forgiven. And we can hear\r\nthe cheers, laden with vanity, as also with true glory, with which they\r\nwere received. There had been some discussion during the Mutiny as to\r\nthe expediency of accepting such foreign helps as had been offered. Two\r\nBelgian regiments had been suggested. But Lord Palmerston had set his\r\nface against all assistance, even from Belgium. He wrote as follows to\r\nLord Clarendon on the matter;--“The more I think of it, the more I feel\r\nit is necessary for our standing and reputation in the world that we\r\nshould put down this mutiny and restore order by our own means; and I am\r\nperfectly certain that we can do it, and that we shall do it.” And now\r\nit had been done.\r\n\r\nWe must pause for a moment here, to state that a Bill was now brought\r\nbefore Parliament for entirely altering the system under which India was\r\ngoverned. My readers will probably know that up to this time the East\r\nIndia Company did exist, with the power, which had gradually been\r\ncurtailed indeed, and brought more or less under Government control, of\r\nmanaging the affairs of India as though it were simply the scene of\r\ncertain commercial transactions. There was a Board of Control attached\r\nto the Government, but there was no Secretary of State for India. There\r\nwas a Board of Directors, but no Indian Council directly appointed by\r\nGovernment. And my readers also know that there is at present a\r\nSecretary of State, equal in rank to the other Secretaries; and that\r\nIndia has become a branch of our Government,--as the Colonies are, and\r\nForeign Affairs. I do not know that I need go further into the nature of\r\nthe change effected than to say that it was carried out in conformity\r\nwith the proposition made by Lord Palmerston, and in compliance with the\r\nQueen’s Speech in the previous December. This was done early in 1858.\r\nThere was a long debate on the first reading, and infinite delays were\r\nproposed. This was chiefly due to Mr. Disraeli. He declared that “at\r\npresent we are undertaking an immense liability; we are entering into\r\nengagements which will some day make us tremble; and we have no security\r\nwhatever that those who really possess power in India, who really manage\r\nthe resources of the country, will be in the least controlled for our\r\nbenefit.” Nevertheless, upon a division, the Bill was carried by a\r\nmajority of 145, against an amendment moved, recommending delay. Such\r\nwas the end of the East India Company as a ruling power; and since that\r\ndate India has been simply a dependency of the British throne, as are\r\nCanada and the Australias. This, too, is to be reckoned among the\r\nperformances of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nThen there arose a question on which Lord Palmerston was most absurdly\r\nturned out of office; and he remained out from February, 1858, to June,\r\n1859. It was done absurdly, because the matter in dispute was one in\r\nwhich, not only the country, but also the House of Commons, was\r\naltogether at one with him. An attempt had been made to murder the\r\nEmperor of the French. It had been done in a manner altogether reckless\r\nof human life, the number killed and wounded when the Emperor escaped\r\nhaving been stated as high as 150. And the horror was felt to have been\r\naggravated when it was known that the Empress had been with the Emperor\r\nwhen the attempt was made. Orsini, an Italian, was the leader of the\r\ngang by whom the grenades were thrown beneath the Emperor’s carriage;\r\nand it came out in evidence that Orsini, with his fellow-assassins, had\r\nlived in England, and had here constructed his murderous machine. The\r\nFrench Minister of the Emperor applied to our Foreign Office for\r\nco-operation in the matter, and desired that the law might be so altered\r\nas to make it impossible that suspected assassins,--assassins\r\nsuspected--should to be so by the English or French Government, be able\r\nto carry on their trade in London. Lord Palmerston assented, and a Bill,\r\nintending to give the Ministry of the day the power of dealing with such\r\npersons, was carried in the House of Commons by a majority of no less\r\nthan 200. This may be taken as the outspoken opinion of the House, when\r\nits feeling was simply one of indignant wrath in regard to Orsini.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime the “French Colonels” had signalized themselves. The\r\nFrench Colonels were certain officers who were indignant on the matter.\r\nThey had known that Orsini had brought his grenades from London, but had\r\nnot known that the British Government was anxious to do as the French\r\nMinisters would have them. They consequently sent various addresses to\r\nthe Emperor, in which the abominable conduct of England was described in\r\nvery strong language. The “Colonels” appeared to have thought that all\r\nEngland had been engaged in making murderous weapons for the\r\naccommodation of Orsini. And these addresses were unfortunately\r\npublished in the _Moniteur_, whereby a quasi-official authority was\r\nattached to them; because all things published in the _Moniteur_ were\r\nsupposed to have received an official stamp. The French Ambassador\r\nexpressed his regret, stating that the addresses had passed into the\r\n_Moniteur_ without notice, and Lord Palmerston urged the House to\r\ndisregard the vapourings of the “Colonels.” But the insult to the nation\r\nwas there, in the columns of the _Moniteur_, and was much more widely\r\nknown than the apology which had been sent. There does appear to have\r\nbeen some lack of official despatches which might have been made known\r\nto the House. At any rate, an amendment was now proposed,--“That this\r\nHouse cannot but regret that Her Majesty’s Government, previously to\r\ninviting the House to amend the law of conspiracy at the present time,\r\nhave not felt it to be their duty to reply to the important despatch\r\nreceived from the French Government, dated January 20”--and this was\r\ncarried by a majority of 19.\r\n\r\nWhen that former strong expression of opinion had been given by 299\r\nvotes to 99, the Government had been supported by the desire of the\r\nTories at large, to keep down such a nest of hornets as Orsini and his\r\nconspirators. To banish them from the country, or to hang them if it\r\nwere necessary, must have seemed good, and did seem good, to Lord\r\nDerby’s party. And it was not the less good because of the French\r\n“Colonels”--who after all were a gallant set of fellows enough, standing\r\nup for their country and their Emperor. But it was seen that an instant\r\nadvantage might be taken of Lord Palmerston and his Government; and they\r\nwho led the Tory party were not slow to take advantage of it. Lord\r\nPalmerston, who seems to have been moved to wrath by such desertion,\r\nresigned on the following day, and Lord Derby came into office with Mr.\r\nDisraeli as his first lieutenant. Palmerston remained out for sixteen\r\nmonths; but before we go with him into comparative obscurity, we must\r\npoint out that he had now been dismissed--on the motion too of Mr.\r\nMilner Gibson, one of his old enemies, the peace-party,--not because as\r\nof yore he was supposed to have been arrogant on the part of England,\r\nand in the general course of his policy to have given offence to foreign\r\nnations; but because he was supposed,--erroneously supposed,--to have\r\ntruckled to French orders. Palmerston was the same as ever; but so also\r\nwas the English nation. When he was accused of arrogance abroad, he was\r\ndear old Pam to the normal Englishman. But when he was foolishly\r\nconceived to have unduly yielded an inch to French influence, there came\r\ninstantly to his opponents the power of turning him out,--which his\r\nopponents were not slow to do.\r\n\r\nDuring his holiday he took the chair at the Royal Literary Fund dinner,\r\nand there, as elsewhere, he made a speech serviceable to the occasion.\r\nTo make a speech at the Literary Fund dinner seems to be a duty expected\r\nfrom an ex-Prime Minister. Then came a Reform Bill introduced by the\r\nTories;--this was in 1859. But Lord John was not going to accept a\r\nReform Bill from the Tories as long as he could avoid it. The Government\r\nwas left in a minority, Lord John having moved an amendment condemning\r\nthe Tory Bill. Thereupon Lord Derby went out, and the Queen was again\r\ncalled upon to form a Ministry.\r\n\r\nThese formations of new Ministries seem to come very rapidly in the\r\nrecord of one man’s life, and to be passed by as though they were\r\nmatters of no real importance! But to us looking back now over the\r\nintervening years,--and twenty-three years have intervened,--how\r\nmomentous was that unexpected sending for Lord Granville when Lord Derby\r\nretired! Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston had made a compact\r\ntogether that, as the Queen might choose between them, either would help\r\nthe other; Lord Palmerston had by this time resolved to abandon his\r\nwrath, and Lord John, who expected probably to regain his ascendency,\r\nstill would not decline to serve a second time under his old colleague\r\nshould the Queen require him. But the claims of the two were equal, and\r\nLord Granville, as being between them, was selected. When Lord\r\nPalmerston had before been asked to reconstruct a Ministry, the country\r\nhad been at war, and every Englishman was in earnest. Then there had\r\nbeen no alternative. But now there could be no reason why Lord\r\nPalmerston should not go back to the ranks; though there might be a\r\nreason why he should not serve under Lord John. When it was suggested to\r\nLord Palmerston that he should serve under Lord Granville he wrote as\r\nfollows to the Queen; “Viscount Palmerston and Lord John Russell, before\r\nthey called the meeting at Willis’s Rooms, came to an agreement to\r\nco-operate with each other in the formation of a new Administration,\r\nwhichever of the two might be called upon by your Majesty to reconstruct\r\nyour Majesty’s Government. That agreement did not extend to the case of\r\nany third person; but Viscount Palmerston conceives that the same sense\r\nof public duty which had led him to enter into that engagement with Lord\r\nJohn Russell should also lead him to give assistance to Lord Granville\r\ntowards the execution of your Majesty’s commands. Viscount Palmerston’s\r\npromise to Lord Granville has, however, been conditional.” “The promise\r\ntherefore, which he has given to Lord Granville has been made\r\nconditional on Lord Granville’s success in organizing a Government so\r\ncomposed as to be calculated officially to carry on the public service,\r\nand to command the confidence of Parliament and of the country.” But\r\nLord Granville was not successful. He found, we are told, that Lord John\r\nwas unwilling to serve under him, and at the same time to leave the\r\nleadership of the House of Commons in Lord Palmerston’s hands.\r\nConsequently Lord Palmerston was again sent for, and became a second\r\ntime Prime Minister in his seventy-fifth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON AS PRIME MINISTER, FROM 1859 TO HIS DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unification of Italy was the first matter of importance to which\r\nLord Palmerston’s new Cabinet had to apply itself. Lord John Russell was\r\nForeign Secretary, but we perceive that Palmerston kept a hold of the\r\nreins himself. The things chiefly to be done were as follows. Austria\r\nstill held Venetia, but had been made to abandon Lombardy by Marshal Mac\r\nMahon at the battle of Magenta. Austria had to be put down and made to\r\ndepart out of Venetia if possible. France had been victorious; but the\r\nEmperor claimed as his reward Savoy and Nice. It was too late for\r\nPalmerston to save Savoy and Nice. That blot on poor Cavour’s name must\r\nremain a stain for ever. He had told our Minister at Turin that they\r\nwere not to be given up, and had known when he said so that their doom\r\nhad been spoken. But the Emperor must be stopped and not allowed to run\r\nheadlong with the _éclat_ of his victories. In this matter the Emperor,\r\ntoo, had deceived him. And Italy must be encouraged to take her place\r\namong the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThese were the matters as to which, in regard to Italy, the British\r\nCabinet was at the present moment anxious. Palmerston’s dislike to\r\nAustria,--we might almost call it hatred,--still remained hot as ever.\r\nIn a memorandum prepared for the Cabinet, Lord Palmerston defended\r\nNapoleon as against Austria. “Austria took our subsidies, bound herself\r\nby treaty not to make peace without our concurrence, sustained signal\r\ndefeat in battle, and precipitately made peace without our concurrence.\r\nBut on what occasion has the Emperor Napoleon so acted?--on none.” This\r\nwas written in January, 1860; but a little later on, when the story of\r\nSavoy and Nice was known, he shows his jealousy of Napoleon. In April of\r\nthe same year, he writes to Lord Cowley at Paris; “The Emperor’s mind is\r\nas full of schemes as a warren is full of rabbits, and, like rabbits,\r\nhis schemes go to ground for the moment to avoid notice or antagonism.”\r\nAnd there is a record of a conversation which he had with Count Flahault\r\na few days previously. Count Flahault was just going to Paris, and asked\r\nhim what he should say to the Emperor. The Prime Minister was, what we\r\nshall call, very outspoken. England desired peace, he said, but if the\r\nEmperor was desirous of war, he would find that England was quite ready\r\nfor him. And he says in a letter to the Duke of Somerset; “I have\r\nwatched the Emperor narrowly, and have studied his character and\r\nconduct. You may rely upon it, that at the bottom of his heart there\r\nrankles a deep and inextinguishable desire to humble and punish\r\nEngland.” He says to Lord Cowley; “The seizure of Savoy and Nice, and\r\nthe breach of promise towards Switzerland about the cession of the Swiss\r\nof the neutralized district, are matters which cannot be got over\r\neasily.” From these quotations it will be seen how intent he was on\r\nkeeping the Emperor in his place, and saving this country, if it might\r\nbe saved, from some future battle of Dorking. But in regard to the state\r\nof Italy at the time, he had expressed himself very strongly in the\r\nmemorandum above quoted; “There can be no reasonable doubt, therefore,\r\nthat both France and Sardinia would unite with England in maintaining\r\nthe principle that the Italians should be secured against foreign\r\ncompulsion, and should be left free to determine, according to their own\r\nwill, what shall be their future political condition.”\r\n\r\nIn all these matters Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell were, between\r\nthem, successful--at any rate in the accomplishment of their wishes.\r\nAustria was altogether driven out of Italy. The French Emperor did not\r\nattempt to avenge Waterloo. And Italy has become a united nation, ruling\r\nherself in accordance with her own will.\r\n\r\nBut in order to make good the boasts which he had made to Count\r\nFlahault, it was necessary that the country should be on its guard. Its\r\nsecurity, by military means, was always present to Lord Palmerston’s\r\nmind. He had written a letter in December, 1859, to Mr. Gladstone on the\r\nsubject, and he must, we should think, have startled Mr. Gladstone by\r\nthe nonchalant audacity with which he proposed that ten or eleven\r\nmillions should be at once voted for fortifications to defend Portsmouth\r\nand Plymouth. Then he goes into the manner in which the money should be\r\nraised,--as to which we cannot but imagine that Mr. Gladstone had his\r\nown way. But the millions were voted, and the fortifications were\r\nerected; and the Volunteer Force was set on foot,--with what enormous\r\nresults is now patent to the whole country. In consequence of what was\r\nthen done, England has now got a double army, one for service abroad,\r\nand the other at home. It is only now beginning to be seen and\r\nunderstood that the defence of our own shores may be trusted to men less\r\nexpensively organized than in regiments of the line.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Lord Palmerston was installed as Warden of the Cinque Ports, by\r\nwhich he obtained the use of what was believed to be a comfortable\r\nresidence near Dover. As Broadlands and Brocket Hall, as well as\r\nCambridge House, in Piccadilly, to which he had long since removed, were\r\nall on his hands, this could not have been much to him. But the\r\ninstallation gave him at any rate the pleasure of going down once more\r\nto Tiverton, and meeting his old friend Mr. Rowcliffe, the butcher. For\r\nthe Wardenship was an office, so called, of profit, and the new election\r\nwas necessary. He was returned without a contest, but not without the\r\nusual preliminary discussion with Mr. Rowcliffe.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to refer to all the measures, or even to all those\r\nof importance, with which Lord Palmerston was concerned at this period\r\nof his life. In 1860 the paper duties had been discussed; and now that\r\nthis matter has been well-nigh forgotten among the things that have been\r\nquickly settled, we can hardly realize the disturbance to our feelings,\r\nand even the animosity, which they created. The House of Lords took upon\r\nitself to throw the bill out; whereas a remission of taxation is an\r\naffair which the Lower House conceives to belong exclusively to itself.\r\nBut Palmerston, whose own heart was hardly in the matter, but who was\r\nmuch concerned in keeping peace between the two Houses, contrived to\r\nsmooth matters down, so that the bill was passed in 1861, and nothing\r\nmore has been since heard of the paper duties. To us it seems that a\r\npenny is, and ever has been, the normal price of a daily\r\nnewspaper,--unless when the _Times_, or some other daily journal if\r\nthere be another, chooses on behalf of old gentlemen and ladies to be\r\nabsurdly luxurious at threepence.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the American War of Secession commenced, and in the same year,\r\non the 14th of December, the Prince Consort died. It must have been\r\npleasant to Lord Palmerston to remember that all feelings of\r\nanimosity,--or rather of hard judgment against him,--had passed away. We\r\ncan all remember the intense personal sorrow with which the death of the\r\nPrince was received by us. A good man had gone from among us, leaving\r\nvacant a place which could never more be filled. A man so good at all\r\npoints is a rare possession, and England has never ceased to want him\r\nand to mourn him.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly at the same time there sprang up an incident in the\r\nAmerican War of Secession which nearly carried us into the whirlpool in\r\nspite of the careful efforts we made to avoid the danger. The Southern\r\nStates had seceded because they had been unwilling to see the government\r\nof the country pass from them, the Democratic party, into the hands of\r\ntheir opponents, the Republicans. The Democratic party had grown up and\r\nbeen in power almost since the days of the Adamses, and now felt aware\r\nthat all their most cherished political institutions were endangered by\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Lincoln as President. Mr. Lincoln was a thorough\r\nRepublican. To show how the two parties had hitherto fought the battle,\r\neach by the creation of new States which should, or should not, foster\r\nslavery within their boundaries, is too long a task to be undertaken\r\nhere. Should Texas, which was devoted to slavery, become one State or\r\nshould it be four? Should Kansas be slave or free? Should Nevada and\r\nNebraska, free-soil States as they would be, be admitted or excluded?\r\nEach State must have two Senators, and on the number of Senators the\r\nmanipulation of the powers of government depended. The growing wealth\r\nand population of the North at last won the day, and the South, seeing\r\nhow it was with them, determined to secede. They did endeavour to\r\nsecede, and a state of war was the consequence.\r\n\r\nThere can now be no doubt, I think, in any unprejudiced mind that the\r\nsole effort made by the English Government during the war was to hold\r\ntheir own hands with absolute impartiality, and allow the Americans to\r\nfight it out. In private life, opinions varied; and, following a broad\r\nline, we may say that the commercial classes were in favour of the\r\nNorth, and the agricultural and the aristocratic of the South. And these\r\nfeelings, either on the one side or the other, were enhanced by the\r\ngrowing deficiency of cotton. We find even Lord Palmerston suggesting\r\nthat the idea of a French Ambassador should be entertained, for\r\ncompelling the Northern States to let cotton from the South make its way\r\nto Europe. A more unjust, or indeed impossible, solution of the\r\ndifficulty could not be found. But Palmerston simply mentioned the\r\nmatter to a colleague in the Cabinet, and the question of interference\r\nor non-interference, of recognition or the reverse, was, as far as\r\noutsiders could perceive, left chiefly in the hands of Lord Russell, who\r\nwas Foreign Secretary. Lord John had been created a peer in July, 1861.\r\nBy the entire Cabinet the decision was come to that England would not\r\ninterfere, and would not recognize the South. As far as the English\r\nGovernment was concerned, of which Lord Palmerston was the head, such\r\nwas its line of policy from first to last; and the Northern party in the\r\nwar was certainly not justified in feeling animosity against England.\r\n\r\nBut such a feeling was very strong in the States. It was thought that\r\nEngland should at once have patted the North on the back, as having that\r\nside in the quarrel to which manifest justice belonged. Then sprang up\r\nthe _Trent_ affair, which, but for the united wisdom of two men in the\r\nStates, of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward his Chief Secretary, would\r\ncertainly have brought us into war. And here, no doubt, Lord Palmerston\r\ndid take an active part in preparing, under certain circumstances, for\r\nactive measures.\r\n\r\nAs the North believed in England’s enmity, so did the South in her\r\nfriendship. As the fighting became brisk and hard, could they not send\r\ntwo Commissioners to England to arrange terms for their recognition?\r\nWith this view Messrs. Slidell and Mason were to be sent. But passenger\r\nships did not run then from Charleston to Liverpool with more freedom\r\nthan cotton ships. The gentlemen had to be smuggled to England, and made\r\ntheir way as far as Cuba on their road. One would say that the\r\ndifficulties of the journey were then overcome. And so they thought when\r\nthey took their places on board the British mail steamer _Trent_, which\r\nran from the Havanah to St. Thomas. At St. Thomas they would be as\r\nthough they were in England.\r\n\r\nBut there is many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip. As the _Trent_ was\r\nrunning up to St. Thomas, she was stopped by an American man-of-war, the\r\n_San Jacinto_, under the command of the redoubtable Captain Wilkes, and\r\nthe Southerners were taken out of her and carried back to Boston. A\r\ngreat fuss was made about the achievement, as though Captain Wilkes had\r\ndone something very heroic, and there was some talk of giving him a\r\nsword. Thanks were voted to him by Congress. He had done nothing but a\r\npoliceman’s work, and had done it without orders. But it was conceived\r\nhe had gone halfway to beating the South,--and not only the South, but\r\nEngland also.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Guards were sent to Canada. It was the quickly\r\nexpressed determination of England, in uttering which Lord Palmerston\r\nwas the mouthpiece of the country, that unless these two men were sent\r\nover to England at once,--or were enabled to make the journey which they\r\nhad promised themselves when they got on board the _Trent_,--our\r\nMinister should be withdrawn, and war should be declared. A man-of-war\r\ndid come to the Potomac, ready to take away Lord Lyons and his suite. In\r\nWashington, we heard that on the next day war was to have been\r\ndeclared,--unless Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward yielded. Mr. Sumner, who as\r\nChairman of the Committee of the Senate on Foreign Politics was\r\nsomething akin to our Foreign Secretary, was hot against it. He was\r\nsupposed to be the true patriotic American of the day. But before we\r\nwent to bed that night in Washington we had been told that Messrs.\r\nSlidell and Mason were to be sent on to England. When they got there\r\nthey could do nothing for the recognition of the South. England passed\r\nthrough that danger, and Lord Palmerston was enabled to think of other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWe are drawing now to the end of Lord Palmerston’s career, and have only\r\nfurther to notice the Schleswig-Holstein affair, and the great debate\r\nwhich took place respecting it in July, 1864. There had previously been\r\nquestions of the ill-treatment of the Poles by Russia, and of the\r\nre-modelling of the Treaty of Vienna. In neither of these matters was\r\nanything effectual done by England; but in both of them Palmerston\r\nshowed the caution which had come to him, not from years, but from his\r\nthorough acquaintance with the state of Europe. England had seen the\r\nthird Napoleon become, as it were, her natural ally. But against the\r\ncraft of the Emperor our Prime Minister was specially on his guard.\r\nFrance desired confirmation for what had lately passed, and a new\r\nTreaty, so that Europe should be re-arranged as she specially desired to\r\narrange it; and France specially wanted some plea by which she could\r\nstretch her boundaries as far as the Rhine. This matter is only\r\ninteresting to us now as showing the care which Lord Palmerston, on the\r\npart of England, exercised in his latter days against his old friend the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nThen came the affair of Schleswig-Holstein, which it would be very\r\ndifficult to explain in the penultimate chapter of such a book as this;\r\nand which would be very uninteresting if explained. Denmark was\r\nundoubtedly Denmark. Holstein was undoubtedly German, though at present\r\nshe was under the dominion of the King of Denmark. Schleswig may be said\r\nto have been half one and half the other. The encroachments of Prussia,\r\ndestined to envelop all adjacent German-speaking countries, had\r\ncommenced; and Austria, having then a part in the German Diet, joined\r\nherself with Prussia in attacking Denmark. Here, in England, the general\r\nopinion was undoubtedly in favour of Denmark. It was so in the British\r\ninterpretation of the law of Europe on the subject; and also in the idea\r\nthat a little country was undergoing ill-usage from two others that were\r\nmuch larger and more powerful. Lord Russell, as Foreign Secretary,\r\nbecame indignant, and said words which enabled his eager friends and his\r\nactive enemies to declare that he had promised assistance to Denmark.\r\nLord Palmerston, always since the days of Savoy and Nice on his guard\r\nagainst the Emperor of the French, and having, as Prime Minister,\r\nreversed his character as the general tyrant of Europe, wrote as follows\r\nto his colleague: “I share fully your indignation. The conduct of\r\nAustria and Prussia is discreditably bad, and one, or both of them, will\r\nsuffer for it before these matters are settled. I rather doubt, however,\r\nthe expediency of taking at the present moment the steps proposed. The\r\nFrench Government would probably decline it, unless tempted by the\r\nsuggestion that they should place an armed force on the Rhenish frontier\r\nin the event of a refusal by Austria and Prussia,--which refusal we\r\nought to reckon as nearly certain.” But he partially agreed with Lord\r\nRussell. He wrote to the Duke of Somerset; “I own I quite agree with\r\nRussell, that our squadron ought to go to Copenhagen as soon as the\r\nseason will permit, and that it ought to have orders to prevent any\r\ninvasion of, or attack upon, Zealand and Copenhagen.”\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon at last refused to join with us in any attempt to be made\r\non behalf of the Danes. He saw no reason for fighting with the Germans\r\nunless he were to be allowed to stretch himself to the Rhine. Lord\r\nRussell,--and with him the British Cabinet,--found himself unable to\r\nundertake the task single-handed; and consequently Denmark was\r\nabandoned, and the Government had to bear the reproach of having\r\ndeserted their friend. An attack was made upon it in both Houses. In the\r\nHouse of Lords, Lord Palmerston and his colleagues were beaten by a\r\nmajority of nine; and Mr. Disraeli brought the matter forward in the\r\nCommons with many thunderclaps of furious speech. He asked the House to\r\nagree with him that the Government “had lowered the just influence of\r\ntheir country in the councils of Europe, and thereby destroyed the\r\nsecurities for peace.” The debate lasted for four nights, and Mr.\r\nDisraeli’s thunderclap of elocution was certainly loud and frightful. To\r\ntell the truth his speech on the occasion was very strong. Lord\r\nPalmerston spoke on the last day; and as he went down to the House, day\r\nafter day, all the people cheered him. There was at the moment a feeling\r\nagainst Lord Russell, because it was thought that he had promised the\r\nDanes much, and had performed little. But Palmerston was still the\r\npeople’s favourite, and they cheered him to the last. He altogether laid\r\naside the matter at issue, and went into the general question of the\r\nmerits of the Government. Let the people of the country see what had\r\nbeen done by the present Government for the taxes of the country, and\r\nthen he would be afraid of no vote which the House of Commons could give\r\nagainst him. The Government got a majority of eighteen, and were thus\r\nre-established in power, at any rate till the next session.\r\n\r\nThis had taken place in 1864, and the speech he had then delivered was\r\nthe last of the great efforts he had made on that arena. During the next\r\nyear he reached his eightieth birthday. In that same year Parliament,\r\nhaving nearly run out its term of existence, was dissolved, and he was\r\nagain elected for Tiverton. He went from thence to Brocket Hall, having\r\nchosen that residence because of its vicinity to London, and there, with\r\nLady Palmerston to watch over him, he breathed his last. It is a\r\nsingular fact that in the room adjacent to that in which he died\r\nanother Prime Minister of England had left this troublesome world but a\r\nfew years previously, and Lady Palmerston had been the sister of that\r\nother Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThey laid him in Westminster, among the statesmen and men of letters of\r\nwhom his country was proud, and they put up a statue to his name in the\r\nclose neighbourhood of the Chamber in which he had sat almost\r\ncontinuously since it had been built thirty years before. What more\r\ncould they do to perpetuate his memory? But all that would have been\r\nnothing had he not made for himself a lasting position in the minds of\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nLooking back through all the History of England and her worthies, I do\r\nnot know the life of any man who has shown such a career of unchequered\r\ngood fortune and jocund happiness,--or more unblemished honesty and\r\ntruer courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalmerston’s great merit as a governing man arose from his perfect\r\nsympathy with those whom he was called upon to govern;--and his demerit,\r\nsuch as it was, sprang from the same cause. He was bold, industrious,\r\nhonest, strong in purpose as in health, eager, unselfish, and a good\r\ncomrade. He was at the same time self-asserting, exacting, never\r\ndoubting himself when his opinion had been formed, and confident against\r\nthe world in arms. We cannot be surprised that such a one should have\r\nbeen loved by us, and still less so that he should have been hated by\r\nothers. He was an enemy to the Ministers of other Courts, not only\r\nbecause he was bold, honest, and eager, but also because he showed\r\nhimself plainly to have those qualities, and was never tired of\r\nasserting himself because of them. Who is this man that claims to\r\nhimself to be more hardworking and honester than any among us,--and who\r\nis making good his pretensions? Such were not the spoken words of any\r\nforeign statesman of the day; but they describe the feelings on which\r\nthey seem to have acted. And these men at the same time did believe\r\nthemselves, and truly believed themselves, to be intellectually his\r\nsuperiors. Let us take Guizot as one of the number, who had much to do\r\nwith Palmerston, and with whom Palmerston was much concerned. Guizot\r\nmust have been conscious of brighter faculties and greater thinking\r\npower. But he must have been aware that in all discussions among men of\r\nthe same class Palmerston’s word was the strongest, because of his\r\nprobity, and truth, and industry.\r\n\r\nThe same idea occurs to us in reading what has been written of him since\r\nhis death. He is called “stupid” and “blundering” by those who have been\r\nopposed to his politics as a War Minister. But such as his politics\r\nwere, they were always those of his countrymen for the time being; and\r\nin a country professing to be ruled under the Constitution which here\r\nprevails, I do not know what higher praise can be given to a Minister.\r\nLet the people change their principles; let the Cobdens and Brights\r\nteach them that war is altogether a bad thing, and that commerce will\r\nsuffice to procure for us the respect of other nations. I do not say\r\nthat it may not be so, and that the teaching of Cobden and Bright may\r\nnot approve itself in the long run. But such has not yet become the\r\nopinion of Englishmen generally; and until Cobden and Bright have taught\r\ntheir countrymen, the country requires such a Minister as was Lord\r\nPalmerston. They liked his honesty; they liked his self-assertion, and\r\nthey did not like it the less, because he expressed himself with a\r\nhectoring tongue.\r\n\r\nMr. Morley, in his “Life of Cobden,” vol. ii. p. 189, has said of\r\nPalmerston, that Sir John Bowring was wrong in the affair of the\r\n_Arrow_, and should have been recalled. He then goes on as follows; “It\r\nwas not, however, to be expected from the statesman, whose politics\r\nnever got beyond _Civis Romanus_, especially when he was dealing with a\r\nvery weak power.” The charge here made is manifestly unjust. Had he\r\nsaid that Palmerston had preached the doctrine of _Civis Romanus_\r\nagainst all nations, weak or strong,--_usque ad nauseam_,--there might\r\nhave been some truth in the saying. But the sting of the reproach lies\r\nin the assertion that he had preached it especially when the weak were\r\nopposed to him. He has intended to imply that when Greece or Portugal\r\nwere concerned, then, on behalf of Britons, Palmerston exclaimed, _Civis\r\nRomanus_; but that he lowered his colours and bated his breath when he\r\nhad to deal with France or Austria, with Russia or Prussia. Against this\r\nI protest. Take all the matters in which he was engaged with other\r\ncountries,--the creation of Belgium, the Spanish marriages, his\r\ntreatment of Metternich and Buol, and his life-long battle with\r\nNicholas, and then say whether he was _Civis Romanus_ “especially with\r\nthe weaker powers!” The word has escaped Mr. Morley in the pride of his\r\ncontempt, and should be recalled from a work destined to live long\r\nbecause of merits which his prejudice cannot obscure.\r\n\r\nBut we do know that Lord Palmerston was unpopular among the foreigners,\r\nespecially in the early part of his career. Mr. Greville thus wrote of\r\nhim in his journal in 1834; “Madame de Lieven told me that it was\r\nimpossible to describe the contempt as well as dislike which the whole\r\n_corps-diplomatique_ had for Palmerston, and, pointing to Talleyrand,\r\nwho was sitting close by, ‘surtout lui.’ They have the meanest opinion\r\nof his capacity, and his manners are the reverse of conciliatory.”\r\nAgain, he says, in 1835; “Palmerston is beaten in Hants, at which\r\neveryone rejoices.” But by degrees Mr. Greville mends his verdict. “The\r\nother night I met some clerks in the Foreign Office to whom the very\r\nname of Palmerston is hateful. But I was surprised to hear\r\nthem,--Mellish particularly, who can judge both from capacity and\r\nopportunity,--give ample testimony to his abilities.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that even among Englishmen likely to be\r\nintimate with the diplomatic circle in London, so late as 1835 Lord\r\nPalmerston was supposed to have been generally unpopular, and his want\r\nof punctuality is spoken of, a fault likely to interfere much with the\r\ncomfort of others. But at that time he was a man of fashion, and though\r\nhe had been for many years specially noted for his industry in mastering\r\nall the details of his office,--at the War Office for instance, through\r\nhis many years of service before he was appointed to the Foreign\r\nOffice,--it may be surmised that he preferred to work at such hours as\r\nbest suited himself. If this was so, it only gives an additional proof\r\nof that determination to have his own way which governed him through all\r\nhis life. But his popularity as a Minister did not commence even among\r\nEnglishmen till after the dates above quoted from Mr. Greville’s\r\njournal;--nor that respect among foreigners, did in fact mean a\r\nreverence for the power he exercised. It was not in truth known to the\r\nworld at large how great had been his influence in regard to the\r\ncreation of Belgium, nor how powerful had been his policy as to the\r\nquadruple alliance, till long after the period in question. And though\r\nhe was sowing the seed for that respect which afterwards grew till he\r\nhad become the arbiter of European politics generally, the men in whose\r\nminds the seed was growing would not, to themselves, admit the growth\r\nuntil the full plant was there, ripe for the use of the nations. In such\r\na career it was necessary that the man should be hated before he was\r\nesteemed. Therefore it was that Madame de Lieven spoke of him with\r\ncontempt, and told of him how Talleyrand specially disliked him. Had he\r\nbeen courteous and servile, and fit to take a place among themselves,\r\nthe Russian lady and the French gentlemen would have loved the polished\r\nman of fashion well enough.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days Palmerston was a Tory, though he was a member of a\r\nWhig Government. It must be remembered that the death of Mr. Pitt was\r\nstill nearer than the death of Lord Palmerston himself. There had to run\r\nmore than thirty years before the latter event came. It was less than\r\nthirty years since Pitt had died. And Palmerston was still regarded as a\r\nman brought up in the courtly manner; and the fashion after which he was\r\nprepared to form a way of living for himself was not yet deciphered or\r\nunderstood. It was not believed that he intended to be so wise, so\r\nplastic, and so attentive a politician. In this respect he was running\r\nthe same career which Canning had taken before him, and which Gladstone\r\nhas taken since;--and which indeed Peel may be said to have adopted in\r\nthe last year or two of his life. He had grown into accord with the\r\npeople of whom he was one. But neither did he do this as Canning had\r\ndone, with whom it was an affair of genius, of impulse, and of anger;\r\nnor as Peel, with whom it was conscience; nor as Gladstone, on whose\r\nversatile mind all motives which are not ignoble seemed to have acted\r\nwith dangerous rapidity. Palmerston changed slowly without knowing that\r\nhe changed, and learned to wear the common garb of an Englishman because\r\nEnglishmen around him wore it. “It is a brave spectacle,” says the\r\n_Edinburgh_, in an eloquent article on his death, written in January,\r\n1866;--“it is a brave spectacle to look back on, to see the skill and\r\ncourage with which nearly single-handed he fought and baffled\r\ncontinental despotism for more than thirty years.” “Since Cromwell’s\r\ntime no other British statesman has had the honour of having his name\r\nmade a bugbear to frighten children and despot-ridden lands.” “He was\r\naccused of being insolent and aggressive; he was accused of being\r\ntruckling and cowardly. But now that he is gone there is not a man of us\r\nbut would say, with his generous antagonist, ‘We are all proud of him,’”\r\nThe generous antagonist had been Sir Robert Peel; and the words he then\r\nspoke were the last which he uttered in the House of Commons. The writer\r\nthen goes on;--“He is gone; peace to his ashes! It is sad to think we\r\nshall never see again that pleasant face, that jaunty air, still dashed\r\nby a tinge of the dandyism of the regency, that never-failing figure on\r\nthe Treasury Bench which drew all eyes; never hear the cheery trumpet\r\ntone, not unmusical in its cadences; never learn from his graver wisdom,\r\nnor meet his old familiar smile again. We laid him in Westminster Abbey\r\nwith pride as well as sorrow, side by side with the dust of his great\r\ncompeers, not dearer or mightier than he. He was a great man. He loved\r\nhis country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she\r\nwill cherish his memory.”\r\n\r\nAs I am now quoting what was said of him shortly after his death, I will\r\ngive an extract from an article which appeared in August, 1868, in the\r\n_Saint Paul’s Magazine_, and was from the hand of Mr. Peter Bayne;--\r\n\r\n“When we were at war with Russia, and when the nation, after trying\r\nstatesman after statesman, continued in the distressing consciousness\r\nthat the administration lacked vigour, the man who, for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, had been checkmating the policy of Russia was naturally called\r\nfor. In no spirit of confidence or enthusiasm,--feeling clearly that\r\nothers had failed, but by no means certain that the right man was yet\r\ndiscovered,--England said, ‘Try Palmerston.’ It was on the 8th of\r\nFebruary, 1855, that the Earl of Derby withdrew, and that he took the\r\nhelm. On the 16th he explained his position to the House. Already all\r\nthe machinery of an energetic administration was at work, and as the new\r\nPrime Minister glanced at department after department, detailing what\r\nhad been done and what was planned, members felt that a new spirit of\r\nenergy was already penetrating the framework of Government. The country\r\nlooked on in hope, beginning to breathe more freely. Month after month\r\nwent by; month after month the public watched. Troubles came at first in\r\nthreatening battalions upon the Ministry; but the practical instinct of\r\nthe nation gradually decided that Palmerston was the man to whom the\r\nbusiness of the war could be committed, and in whose hands the name of\r\nEngland was safe. It was astonishing with what ease he held the reins at\r\nthat noisy time, and with what lightness and self-possession he\r\nencountered the obstacles in his path. In May the Opposition made a\r\ndetermined attempt to unseat him, and a long and stormy debate took\r\nplace. Mr. Disraeli, anxious to avail himself of the uneasy and\r\ndisconted feeling which still widely prevailed, and to make the most of\r\nthe inarticulate shouting of a number of ill-informed people who called\r\nthemselves Administrative Reformers, moved a resolution to the effect\r\nthat the language of Her Majesty’s Government was ‘ambiguous and\r\nuncertain.’ The Opposition maintained the attack with spirit and\r\nanimosity, and the men below the gangway on the Liberal side, in whose\r\neyes Lord Palmerston never found favour, kept up a raking fire of\r\nargument, taunt and invective. Mr. Disraeli closed the attack in one of\r\nhis most impassioned philippics. One can still see him with the mind’s\r\neye as his sentences rang through the House, his right arm coming down\r\nwith fierce emphasis at each rhetorical close, while he asked, in\r\nimpetuous torrent of interrogatives, whether the Prime Minister had not\r\ndone this, that, and the other evil thing? It was beautiful to observe\r\nLord Palmerston sitting in fixed and placid attention, cool as an old\r\nadmiral cut out of oak, the figure-head of a seventy-four gun ship in a\r\nBiscay squall. At last, as the hours of morning stole on, he placed his\r\nhat quietly on the table, and, amid the intense excitement of the House,\r\nsprang to his feet. Not a shade of agitation or anxiety could you trace\r\non that brave, clear, splendidly intelligent face. The forehead, broad\r\nand expansive, the eye frank, fearless, and sparkling, the whole\r\ncountenance radiant with energy, courage, good temper, spoke assurance\r\nto his party and defiance to the Opposition. He had got into the heart\r\nof his subject,--eleven and a half columns of Hansard had been\r\nspoken,--when the cry of ‘Black Rod’ echoed through the House, and the\r\nusher who rejoices in that mysterious title summoned the Commons to the\r\nbar of the Lords, to receive her Majesty’s assent by commission to\r\ncertain Bills. Lord Palmerston was interrupted; the Speaker left the\r\nchair, and, with as many of the members as chose to accompany him,\r\nproceeded to the Upper House. After a while the Speaker returned, and\r\nLord Palmerston resumed. ‘I think,’--these were his first words,--‘I\r\nhave some reason to complain of the impatience of the other House in not\r\nwaiting for the censure which the right honourable gentleman opposite is\r\ndesirous of inflicting, but in prematurely administering the rod.’ The\r\nOpposition, joining in the titter which ran along every bench, learned\r\nthat the tempest they had so passionately raised had agitated the mind\r\nof Lord Palmerston to no greater extent than was consistent with its\r\nwafting towards them a jest so feather-light as this. The next second he\r\nwas grappling with the arguments of his opponents, and in one or two\r\nminutes all recollection of the interruption had passed from the memory\r\nof the House. His speech may be pronounced one of the noblest ever\r\nuttered in Parliament. Simple, manly, luminous, convincing, high in tone\r\nand unanswerable in reasoning, it told upon the intellect not only of\r\nParliament, not only of England, but of the civilized world. Some of its\r\nsentences deserve to be remembered. ‘I feel that, in whatever hands the\r\nGovernment is placed, the will of the country must and will be obeyed. I\r\nknow that will is that England, having engaged in a war necessary and\r\njust, in concert with our great ally and neighbour, France, must and\r\nshall succeed.’ From the moment he was Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston\r\nfelt that he held a trust higher than the interests of party, and not in\r\nthe utmost fervour of debate, not in the most unguarded moment of social\r\nconverse, could an expression pass his lips which, in discrediting his\r\nadversaries, cast a slur upon the name of England. In a still loftier\r\ntone, one seldom assumed by Lord Palmerston, and never except in a\r\nspirit of deep reverence and sincerity, is the following: ‘The fate of\r\nbattle is in the hands of a Higher Power. It is not in our power to\r\ncommand success, but it is enough for us to do all in our power to\r\nobtain it. That we have done. In a cause which we consider to be just,\r\nnecessary, and honourable, we confidently place our trust in a Higher\r\nPower.’ Mr. Disraeli was beaten by a majority of one hundred, and the\r\nGovernment confirmed in the hands of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n“From that night he was a kind of monarch in England. We learned to call\r\nhim Old Pam, and to love him better than any Prime Minister was ever\r\nloved throughout the three kingdoms. All parties in the House took to\r\nhim. It was pleasant to sit under his parliamentary government, and\r\nthough there were Liberals more liberal than he, and Conservatives more\r\nconservative, the majority both of Liberals and Conservatives secretly\r\npreferred him to their special chiefs. He had not the slowness and heavy\r\ndecorum of Earl Russell; he did not startle country gentlemen with\r\nextravagances, paradoxes, and freaks of intellectual rope-dancing, like\r\nMr. Disraeli; and his virtue was not of that grim and earnest kind which\r\nrebukes a worldly-minded legislature in the person of Mr. Gladstone. The\r\ngreat neutral party in and out of the House discovered that the\r\nfirebrand Palmerston would not kindle dangerous conflagrations, but was\r\nopulent in the heat that warms without burning.”\r\n\r\nAnd further on he says;--\r\n\r\n“Perhaps no single word goes so far in the description of Lord\r\nPalmerston as the word ‘manly.’ The feminine element is strong in some\r\nmen,--they are vehement, impulsive, meekly obstinate, prone to extremes,\r\napt to call whims principles, breaking down all fences of logic in their\r\nteacup storms of feeling. In every respect Lord Palmerston was\r\nmasculine, not feminine. In one of those wise, well-packed bits which\r\nyou meet with in the writings of Goethe, it is observed that the key to\r\nthe female character, as distinguished from that of the man, is found in\r\na reference to the personal and private nature of the interests of women\r\nas contrasted with the wider interests of men. Her husband, her\r\nchildren, her household,--these are a woman’s own, and within the circle\r\nof these Nature has ordained that her affections shall have their\r\nheartfelt play. These interests are essentially disjunctive; they\r\npertain to the woman alone, and they isolate, while they intensify, her\r\nsympathies. The gregariousness of humankind, on the other hand, comes\r\nout where man acts in association with man; and man’s institution is not\r\nthe family circle, but the nation. The masculine interests are common to\r\nthe race, and the mental operation of the man is the impersonal reason\r\nwhich knows no prepossession and rejects all colouring of emotion. The\r\nDuke of Wellington occurs to one as specially illustrating Goethe’s\r\nconception of the masculine mind; and Lord Palmerston was at all points\r\na man. No sentimental egotism, no moral irritability, no sweet feminine\r\ncant about him. A genial stoicism,--not the stoicism of the cynic,--an\r\ninestimable faculty of taking the good and leaving the bad alone, an\r\ninvincible serenity and lightness and brightness of soul, distinguished\r\nhim. Hopeful in adversity, cool in prosperity, ready for any fate,\r\nHorace would have smiled approval on him, and mildly exclaimed, ‘Bene\r\npreparatum pectus!’”\r\n\r\nThe question has often been mooted whether he was or was not an orator.\r\nBefore that question be answered, the man who asks it must decide what\r\nit is to be an orator. An orator such as Bright and Gladstone, or even\r\nas were Disraeli and Lord Derby, as were in former days Mr. Fox, Mr.\r\nBurke, or Mr. Pitt, he certainly was not. He would not, like some of\r\nthese men, have arranged his words with studious care, and have\r\ncommitted the chosen gems of them to his memory; nor, as others have\r\ndone, could he have burst out under the inspiration of genius into a\r\nsudden flow of words to which no study and no memory could have lent\r\nanything. To him it seems that oratory was an evil only to be\r\nencountered for the sake of certain purposes which could not be\r\notherwise attained. How shall men know a fact unless they be told? Or\r\nhow shall a man tell a fact so as to induce belief unless he be\r\ninstructed in the way of doing so? Such was Lord Palmerston’s oratory.\r\nIn the longest, and most telling speeches which he made, he seems never\r\nto have thought of the reflex effect upon himself. In his great effort\r\non the Don Pacifico impeachment, or in his reply to Mr. Disraeli in the\r\nattack made on Lord Russell in regard to Denmark, his object was to\r\nleave such an impression on men’s minds that they should ultimately be\r\nbrought to show their agreement with his side of the question by the\r\nvotes which they were to give. It was for this reason that he did his\r\nbest, and not that he might achieve for himself any palm of oratory.\r\nGladstone bursts into speech that the brightness and splendour and\r\nmarvel of the moment may be his own. Bright is enabled by his intellect\r\nand study, and industry, to carry his admiring hearers along with him.\r\nIn both cases there seems to be left on the hearer’s mind a feeling that\r\nthe orator has without doubt established his right to the name. In the\r\nlatter there is the sense, perhaps, of too great an expenditure of oil\r\nin avoiding a superfluous word. With the other, words run riot with such\r\nglorious fecundity as to leave an impression that some oil might have\r\nbeen expended in pruning their abundance. In Palmerston there was\r\nneither the one nor the other; but in producing the effect which he\r\ngenerally did achieve, there was always an idea present to the hearer,\r\nfirst, that he did not know exactly the words which would best suit his\r\npurpose, and then a feeling that he had fallen into their use by some\r\ncelestial and godlike aid. It was not Palmerston who had made the\r\nspeech, but some goddess Fortune who had put the words on to his lips.\r\n\r\nBy Lord Palmerston his capacity for speaking was only a means used for\r\nan end. The same may be said of all orators. To persuade others is the\r\nart to be achieved. But this is done in most cases by teaching an\r\naudience, or teaching the country to believe that the speaker should be\r\ncredited with the power he seeks to gain because he is great as an\r\norator. It was not simply because Fox was wise that men ranged\r\nthemselves on his side; but because from his tongue words flowed sweeter\r\nthan honey. But with Palmerston there was no thought of words flowing\r\nsweet. He had come to a special crisis of some difficulty, and men had\r\nto be made to vote as he wished them. When that was done, the speech and\r\nall belonging to it was, for his purposes, a thing of the past. He\r\nthought not at all that men should be rapt in wonder at his words. But\r\nthe thing that he was doing, the attempt that he was making, the lesson\r\nthat he was teaching,--the lesson, for instance, that Palmerston was in\r\ntruth the man in Europe who best understood how Europe might be\r\ngoverned,--that was his object in view, with as little of speech as\r\nmight be possible, but still with a sufficiency, as such is the mode of\r\ngoverning in England.\r\n\r\nBut other means were wanting before any credence could be given to the\r\nimmense claim he made on the confidence of those of his own country and\r\nof others. He had to show that he had learned the lesson he attempted\r\nto teach, and could do this only by daily industry and indomitable\r\nperseverance. And it must be understood that the industry and the\r\nperseverance had come before his ambition had formed itself in reference\r\nto the management of Europe. We must go back to his early days, when,\r\nafter spending two years at the Admiralty, he had been, still a lad,\r\ntransferred to the War Office, to perceive how resolutely he had begun\r\nthe work of his life. England was at war, and he determined at once to\r\nlearn all the ways and all the needs of a warfaring nation. But our wars\r\nbrought us among foreign people;--to Spain, to Portugal, to France, and\r\nto the Low Countries. And in this way Palmerston achieved his knowledge\r\nof what they wanted and of what we wanted. He had begun to see the\r\nclaims of other diplomats, and to contest them before he had won his\r\nplace at our own Foreign Office. He had been a young man of fashion; but\r\nthat had been added on, out of the superabundance of his nature. Hard\r\nwork was to him the first necessity of his existence. He loved to be\r\nbrilliant at Almack’s, but he did not care to carry his brilliance into\r\nthe House of Commons. It followed him there in his latter years; but\r\nthat too came from the superabundance of his nature. Some one has said\r\nthat Palmerston, when at his greatest, was powerful and imperious only\r\nwith a pen in his hand. We feel that this was so. But it is thus that\r\nthe official work of a man in office should be done. And as he wrote the\r\nscathing letters to his own ambassadors which were intended to be read\r\nfor the keeping in order of Foreign Ministers, we feel that he was very\r\ngreat. In the course of time they became too bitter. The arbiter of the\r\npolitics of Europe became like other arbiters, its bully. They who\r\nshall hereafter be desirous of saying severe words against him, must if\r\nthey desire their words to be effectual, confine themselves to this\r\ncharge. Against his honesty, his industry and his courage we feel that\r\nno true word can be said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen, Lord, succeeds Palmerston as Foreign Secretary, 81;\r\n

John Charles Herries,” by his son, Edward\r\n Herries, C.B.; with an introduction by Sir Charles Herries, K.C.B.;\r\n published 1880.\r\n\r\n [H] When we read Mr. Kinglake’s picturesque account of the manner in\r\n which the _Coup d’Etat_ was prepared, we find it hard to understand\r\n that Lord Palmerston should have believed as he did. It is odd that\r\n two honest men should have entertained opinions so different. Lord\r\n Palmerston, no doubt, spoke immediately after the event, and the\r\n historian did not give his account till ten years later. But in the\r\n meantime the Emperor had been generally “approved of” in England, and\r\n the question arises whether the approval had been deserved. There were\r\n many here in England who never thought so, and to them the assent of\r\n Lord Palmerston has always been distressing.\r\n\r\n [I] I think it should be remembered,--though I cannot give absolute\r\n proof for such an opinion,--that Palmerston, previous to the _Coup\r\n d’Etat_, had expressed his opinion in favour of an Empire for France;\r\n and it is probable that this opinion had previously reached Napoleon’s\r\n ears. Guided by what he had seen of a former Republic, he did not\r\n believe in a new Republic for France. There might have been an idea,\r\n on the part of the Crown, that in expressing this opinion, even in\r\n private speech or in public writing, he had gone too far. His personal\r\n feeling for the Emperor was, no doubt, friendly and strong, till\r\n subsequently Nice and Savoy had, as he felt treacherously, been taken\r\n from Italy and added to France. At that date Palmerston’s personal\r\n friendship for the Emperor is supposed to have ceased.\r\n\r\n [J] The words were;--“If you should be of opinion that recent\r\n legislation, in contributing, with other causes, to this happy\r\n result, has at the same time inflicted unavoidable injury on certain\r\n important interests, I recommend you dispassionately to consider how\r\n it may be practicable equitably to mitigate that injury, and to enable\r\n the industry of the country to meet successfully that unrestricted\r\n competition to which Parliament, in its wisdom, has decided that it\r\n should be subjected.”\r\n\r\n [K] “Life of Prince Consort,” vol. ii. p. 525.\r\n\r\n [L] “Invasion of the Crimea,” vol. i. p. 374.\r\n\r\n [M] “Invasion of the Crimea,” vol. i. p. 378.\r\n\r\n [N] Lord Ellenborough, when he was Secretary for India, had found\r\n fault with Lord Canning, and had been forced to resign.",
