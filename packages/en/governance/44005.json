Kennedy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, May 6, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ALAN H. BELMONT\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:25 a.m. on May 6, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Gerald\r\nR. Ford, John J. McCloy, and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel; David W. Belin,\r\nassistant counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant counsel; Samuel A. Stern,\r\nassistant counsel; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, gentlemen, the Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nMr. Belin, you had something you wanted the record to show in\r\nconnection with our testimony yesterday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you present it to the Commission now, please.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes, sir. We have a report from an FBI document that states\r\nthat Roy Truly when interviewed on November 22, advised that \"it is\r\npossible Oswald did see him with a rifle in his hands within the past\r\nfew days,\" that is as of November 22, \"as a Mr. Warren Caster, employed\r\nby Southwestern Publishing Co., which company has an office in the same\r\nbuilding, had come to his office with two rifles, one was a .22 caliber\r\nrifle which Caster said he had purchased for his son, and the other\r\na larger more high-powered rifle which Caster said he had purchased\r\nwith which to go deer hunting if he got a chance,\" and Truly said that\r\nhe examined the high-powered rifle and raised it to his shoulder and\r\nsighted over it and then returned it to Caster and Caster left with\r\nboth rifles.\r\n\r\nThen Truly went on to state that he does not own a rifle and has had\r\nno other rifle in his hands or in his possession for a long period of\r\ntime. Now because of the problem that did arise, I believe the staff\r\nwill promptly go down to Dallas to take the deposition of both Mr.\r\nTruly and Mr. Caster to fully get this in deposition form and find out\r\nwhere these rifles were as of November 22.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And their caliber, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir; I think that is desirable. You ought to do that.\r\n\r\nMr. Belmont, the purpose of today's hearing is to take your testimony\r\nconcerning the general procedures of the FBI and explain their\r\nrelationship to the case of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nWould you please rise and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear\r\nthe testimony you are about to give before this Commission will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN, will you conduct the examination, please?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you, sir. Would you state your full name for the\r\nrecord, please?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Alan H. Belmont.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And your address, Mr. Belmont?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. 2711 North Yucatan Street, Arlington, Va.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, what was your education at the college level?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Graduate of Stanford University in California, with an\r\nA.B. degree, majoring in accounting.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What year?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. 1931.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What was your employment briefly before joining the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I joined the Bureau, the FBI, in 1936, and in the interim\r\nI worked for public accountants and as a public accountant myself in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would you describe, please, for the Commission briefly your\r\nexperience in the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 1936?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I entered the FBI November 30, 1936, and after the period\r\nof training, was assigned to Birmingham, Ala., as my first office.\r\nI transferred to Chicago in about August 1937, and remained there\r\nuntil the summer of 1938 when I was transferred to Washington, D.C.,\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nIn January of 1941 I was transferred to New York as supervisor of\r\napplicant and criminal investigative matters, remained there until\r\nthe fall of 1942, when I was made assistant agent in charge of our\r\nChicago office. In January of 1943 I was made agent in charge of our\r\nCincinnati office and remained there until the summer of 1944 when I\r\nwas transferred to New York as assistant agent in charge of criminal\r\nmatters in New York.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I was placed in charge of all security work in New York\r\nfor a number of years and was transferred to Washington in charge of\r\nthe domestic intelligence division in February 1950. I headed that\r\ndivision until about June of 1961 when I was made assistant to the\r\ndirector in charge of all investigative work of the FBI and that is my\r\npresent position.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Could you describe the organization of the FBI with two\r\npurposes in mind: First, to fix your position in the organization.\r\nSecond, to provide a framework for describing the investigation of the\r\ncase of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The headquarters of the FBI is, of course, or the FBI is\r\nheaded by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover as Director. Directly under him is Mr.\r\nClyde Tolson, Associate Director. There are 10 divisions broken down in\r\nparticular types of administration.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I say if any of this is classified, highly classified,\r\nyou had better let us know because then we could go off the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There is nothing classified here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Right. I know that you would have that in mind.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Thank you.\r\n\r\nBasically, the division of the 10 divisions at headquarters is\r\nbetween administrative and investigative. The 10th division is the\r\ninspection division and reports directly to Mr. Hoover. I am in charge\r\nof the investigative divisions which are comprised of the general\r\ninvestigative divisions handling general criminal work, the special\r\ninvestigative division handling special inquiries of applicant nature,\r\nand our aggressive approach to organized crime.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory division handles all examinations of a scientific\r\nnature, and the domestic intelligence division handles all types of\r\nsecurity work. I am in charge of those four divisions, and thus am in\r\ncharge and responsible for our investigative work.\r\n\r\nOur field offices, numbering 55, are geographically located in\r\naccordance with the amount of work in a particular area. Each division\r\nin the field is headed by a special agent in charge, assisted by an\r\nassistant special agent in charge. They are responsible for the proper\r\nconduct of the work within their divisions. They are answerable to Mr.\r\nHoover. They are also supervised, of course, in the particular area of\r\nthe work concerned by the division at headquarters.\r\n\r\nDepending on----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask is that 55 in the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. United States and its possessions.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And Puerto Rico?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It doesn't include your legal----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Legal attachés abroad?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; they are under the direct supervision of our\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the division in the field, we will have a\r\nsupervisory staff in order to properly supervise the work of the agents\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Can you describe the establishment of a typical case,\r\nindicating the meaning of the terms office of origin and auxiliary\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. A case is opened by the FBI upon the receipt of\r\ninformation indicating a matter within the jurisdiction of the FBI.\r\nWe restrict our investigations to those matters which are within our\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe office of origin is the office where the major part of the work\r\nis to be done. Thus it should be the controlling office of the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nNormally, if an individual is under investigation, it will be the\r\noffice where he resides. There will be in many cases investigation to\r\nbe conducted by other offices. Those offices that have investigations\r\nin that case are considered auxiliary offices, and will cover the\r\ninvestigation sent to it, sent to them, by the office of origin or\r\nby another auxiliary office if a lead develops within that area that\r\nrequires attention elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI may say that the office of origin can be changed and is changed if\r\nduring the investigation it becomes apparent that the focus of the\r\ninvestigation has shifted to another area.\r\n\r\nIt is logical, therefore, that that office which bears the brunt of the\r\ninvestigation should be in possession of all the material pertinent\r\nto the investigation and should be charged with the supervision and\r\nrunning of the investigation and the direction of it.\r\n\r\nIn the event the office of origin is changed at any given time, the\r\nprevious office of origin will forward to the new office of origin all\r\nmaterial pertaining to the case so that it will have a complete file\r\nand the necessary knowledge to run the case.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Can you tell us a bit more about how information is\r\nmaintained and how it flows through the system from headquarters to\r\noffice of origin, to the auxiliary office or in the other directions\r\nthat are possible?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Since the information is maintained in a standard and\r\nuniform filing system in both our field offices and our headquarters\r\nso that there is complete uniformity in the handling of information,\r\nour main filing system is at headquarters. Consequently, we need here\r\nall pertinent information in any case. Consequently, the reports and\r\ninformation developed during a case are sent to our headquarters for\r\nfiling.\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent to observe that we conduct close to 2 million name\r\nchecks a year for other agencies and departments of the Federal\r\nGovernment. Consequently, we must have here all pertinent information\r\nso that a name check will reflect the information in possession of the\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nWhen a report is prepared in our field office--an investigation, and\r\nthere are leads or investigation to be performed in another office,\r\ncopies of this report are designated for that office, together with\r\nthe lead or the investigation to be covered. Upon receipt of that the\r\noffice gathers the background information from the report and proceeds\r\nwith the investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This is the auxiliary office?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The auxiliary office.\r\n\r\nIf there is a matter of urgency rather than wait for an investigative\r\nreport, the information will be transmitted by more rapid means, such\r\nas teletype. All of our offices have teletypes; radio, our offices have\r\na radio system; telephone.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that teletype from the office to Washington only, or is\r\nthere some interoffice teletypes?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Each office is connected with each other office by\r\nteletype.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is; all over the country?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; permitting rapid communication.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is, New Orleans and Dallas would have teletype between\r\nthese two offices?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What kind of radio communication, Mr. Belmont, did you\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We have an emergency radio communication so that both for\r\nnormal use, in the matter of expense, to reduce expenses, and for an\r\nemergency, our offices can communicate with headquarters and with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. On your own transmission system?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; that is correct. We feel that in any type of an\r\nemergency we must, because of our heavy responsibilities----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Be able to communicate. As a matter of fact, during the\r\nrecent disaster in Alaska, one of the few means of communication with\r\nthe mainland was our radio system.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is that so?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And we assisted in passing messages down from Alaska.\r\n\r\nWe have a communication called AIRTEL which is simply a communication\r\nin letter form on a particular form which upon receipt is regarded as a\r\nmatter of urgency and requires special handling.\r\n\r\nSo that you will understand that, in an effort to cut expenses, we\r\ndetermined that a matter which could not wait for a report or a letter\r\nwas normally sent by teletype, which is a relatively expensive means of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nBy sending an AIRTEL which would be recognized for special handling,\r\nthe office could receive the same information by mail with a delay of\r\nperhaps 12 hours and it would still receive the urgent handling that we\r\nrequire for that particular thing. That is the purpose of the AIRTEL.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think we might turn now to a description of your role\r\nin the investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald, both before and after the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. As the individual in charge of all investigative\r\noperations, the Lee Harvey Oswald investigation is my responsibility,\r\nthe same as any other investigative case in the Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you have any particular involvement that you can recall\r\nin the investigation of his case before November 22--personally?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; this case was not of the importance or urgency that it\r\nwas considered necessary to call to my personal attention for personal\r\ndirection. You must bear in mind that during the fiscal year 1963 the\r\nFBI handled something in the nature of 636,000 investigative matters.\r\nNecessarily, then, those matters which would be called to my personal\r\nattention for personal handling would have to be on a selective basis.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Have you been personally involved in the investigation since\r\nthe assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I have indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Before we get to this, how many cases of defections to the\r\nSoviet Union would you be investigating in the course of a fiscal year?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I couldn't give you an exact figure on that. It is our\r\nsystem to investigate any individual where there is information or\r\nevidence that indicates a necessity for investigation within our\r\njurisdiction. I do know that we have investigated, and currently are\r\ninvestigating, defectors not only to the Soviet Union but in other\r\nareas of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They also would not come per se to your attention, your\r\npersonal attention?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Depending on the case. If there is a matter which has some\r\nurgency or there is a question of policy, it would and does come to my\r\nattention, and indeed comes to the attention of Mr. Hoover.\r\n\r\nI would not seek to give you any impression that I am not advised of\r\nmany cases, I am. I am kept daily advised, as is Mr. Hoover, of all\r\nmatters of policy or urgency or where there is a question of procedure.\r\nThat is inherent in our system of close supervision.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. What I am getting at is, I think, is the matter of\r\ndefection just out of its own character of such significance that it\r\nbecomes a matter of out of the ordinary importance to the Bureau when\r\nyou learn of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Again, Mr. McCloy, I have no way of knowing the extent to\r\nwhich those particular cases would be called to my attention.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the Oswald case itself, we do take cognizance of these.\r\nImmediately upon the publicity on Oswald, there was a case opened. I\r\ndo know that I see many such cases and where there is an indication\r\nof possible damage to the country through the leak of information,\r\nclassified or in some other instance where there is a question of\r\npolicy or urgency it is immediately called to my attention. I can only\r\nsay in general I do see many such cases.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Well, we had testimony here yesterday that in a\r\npreassassination investigation of Oswald that they learned he was a\r\ndefector, they had interviews with him, and then they marked the case\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nAt one stage it was reopened and then it was closed again because, as I\r\ngather it, there was no indication other than his defection that would\r\nlead to their, to the agents, feeling that this man was capable of\r\nviolence or that he was a dangerous character in any sense.\r\n\r\nI gather that whether or not he was thought to be a dangerous character\r\nor whether he was capable of violence would be settled by the man in\r\nthe field office, in the office that had charge, the man who was in\r\ncharge of the office that was dealing with that case locally, is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is a judgment that he would render, but that judgment\r\nwould be passed on by our headquarters staff.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Passed on by Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, indeed. In this instance by the domestic intelligence\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In this case then the decision to close that case, I am\r\ntalking always about the preassassination business, was approved or\r\ntacitly approved by the Washington staff.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Not tacitly approved. Approved.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Approved. Well, you mark the paper approved or you just\r\naccept it, accept the file with a notation \"return for closing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. When the closing report comes to our headquarters, it is\r\nreviewed by our supervisory staff, and if we do not agree with the\r\naction then the field office is notified to continue the investigation.\r\nThat is a decision of substance.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Well, I can understand that but I gather when the report\r\ncomes in you simply let the report lie unless you feel from your\r\nexamination of it that it justified further action. You don't notify\r\nthe field office, do you, that the closing of the case is approved?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, Mr. McCloy. With the volume of work that we have that\r\nwould be an unnecessary move.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I can understand that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. It is, however, thoroughly understood through our service,\r\nthrough the system that we follow, that if that report comes in and\r\nit is reviewed and it is filed here, if there is disagreement as to\r\nthe handling of the closing of the case or any other matter pertaining\r\nto the investigation, the seat of government will then go out with\r\ninstructions to the field.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question further on that point?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As I recall from the testimony of your people yesterday,\r\nwith regard to the situation in Dallas and later in New Orleans, that\r\nafter the case was marked closed in Dallas, there was this incident in\r\nNew Orleans of the distribution of the Fair Play for Cuba pamphlets,\r\nand then a case there, a live case, an open case was started.\r\n\r\nNow, it wasn't quite clear to me yesterday from all the testimony, I\r\nmissed a bit of it, unfortunately, as to whether the opening of a new\r\ncase in New Orleans, because of the new incident, would operate to\r\nreopen it or change the closed status of the case in Dallas, and the\r\ncase was then transferred from New Orleans to Dallas later. If you\r\ncould clear that up for us I think it would be helpful.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The agent, Fain at the time, who handled the case, closed\r\nthe case after two interviews with Oswald, arriving at the conclusion\r\nthat the purpose of our investigation of Oswald which was to determine\r\nwhether he had been given an assignment by Soviet intelligence, had\r\nbeen served. He closed the case, as he felt there was no further action\r\nto be taken. The purpose had been satisfied. Headquarters agreed.\r\n\r\nIn March 1963 Agent Hosty received information in Dallas to the effect\r\nthat Oswald had been in communication with The Worker, the east coast\r\nCommunist newspaper. He therefore reinstituted the case, and sent out a\r\nlead to check Oswald's employment. He also received information, as I\r\nrecall it, that Oswald had been in communication with the Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee, so there were two incidents that aroused his interest.\r\n\r\nIn June 1963 our New Orleans office likewise received information that\r\nOswald had communicated with The Worker or was on a subscription list\r\nfor The Worker. So that the case was revived in Dallas by Hosty.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was even before what we call the New Orleans incident?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And he learned that Oswald had left Dallas, the residence\r\nwas then picked up in New Orleans, and the case was revived. So that\r\nactually there was a joint revival of the case.\r\n\r\nThen on August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested by the New Orleans police\r\nin connection with a disturbance of the peace in passing out these\r\npamphlets, which further aroused our interest. So that the reopening\r\nof the case after the closing was due to these incidents that I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you. So that at the time of the assassination, this\r\nwas an open and not a closed case as regards the Dallas office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct. At the time that Oswald was found to be\r\nliving in New Orleans, and this was definitely established that he\r\nwas actually residing there, the Dallas office in accordance with the\r\nprocedure that I mentioned, transferred the case to New Orleans as\r\noffice of origin.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the case was again transferred back to Dallas when it was\r\ndetermined that Oswald was again residing in the Dallas area.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, Mr. Stern.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. We were getting, Mr. Belmont, to the question of whether\r\nyou had been personally involved in the investigation since the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I said I have indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes. As a part of that you have reviewed in detail the\r\ninvestigation made prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Have you participated in or supervised the preparation of\r\nreports and other correspondence to the Commission in response to\r\nquestions from the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I show you a letter with attached memorandum which has been\r\nmarked for identification Commission Exhibit No. 833. Can you identify\r\nthis document, Mr. Belmont?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 833 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is a letter transmitted on April 6, 1964, to Mr.\r\nRankin by the FBI with enclosure answering a number of questions which\r\nthe Commission posed to the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you supervise the preparation of this letter?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you have reviewed it and are familiar with it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. We have covered in your answers to Mr. Dulles and Mr. McCloy\r\na good deal of the material in here.\r\n\r\nI would like briefly to touch upon several of the questions, the more\r\nimportant questions, regarding the nature of the FBI's interest in\r\nLee Harvey Oswald at various times, and I would like you to refer to\r\neach question that I indicate but not read your answer. Paraphrase\r\nit. I think we have had a good deal of the specific detail but what\r\nI am interested in is a description from your examination of the\r\ninvestigation as it was carried on, of the nature of the FBI interest\r\nin Oswald.\r\n\r\nI would like to turn to the first question in which we asked----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You mean by that that you could get, we could get, a\r\nbetter idea from paraphrasing the answer than we could get from the\r\nexact answer itself?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think he might be able to highlight the answer. We have\r\nthe exact answer on the record, and I thought it might----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, highlight it, if there is anything in addition I\r\nwould think that would be relevant and pertinent. But to ask him to\r\nparaphrase that which he has done with great meticulousness would seem\r\nto me to be abortive and would take a lot of our time, and I don't see\r\nwhat it would prove. If you have anything in addition that you want to\r\nask him, if you want to ask him if there is anything in addition he has\r\nnot put in there, that is all right. But to just ask him to paraphrase\r\nanswers that have been done with great care would seem to me to be\r\nconfusing the record, and serve no purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I might ask, Mr. Belmont, whether there is anything you\r\nwould like to add or amplify in these questions?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I believe the answers speak for themselves, although in\r\nview of Mr. McCloy's questions a little while ago, I would be very\r\nhappy to make clear our approach to this matter. For example, the\r\nfact that our interest in defectors, in this case, is shown by the\r\nfact that in early November 1959 we opened a file on Oswald based on\r\nthe newspaper publicity as to his defection. And the fact that he had\r\napplied to renounce his citizenship. We checked our files then to see\r\nwas this a man we had a record on, and found that we had a fingerprint\r\nrecord solely based on his enlistment in the Marines.\r\n\r\nWe had no other record on him but we placed a stop or a flash notice\r\nin our fingerprint files, at that time so that if he should come back\r\ninto the country unbeknownst to us and get into some sort of trouble\r\nwe would be immediately notified. That is our opening interest in the\r\ncase with the thought in mind that should he come back to the country\r\nwe would want to know from him whether he had been enlisted by Soviet\r\nintelligence in some manner.\r\n\r\nThat is our procedure because of our experience that these things have\r\nhappened, and we consider it our responsibility to settle that issue\r\nwhenever we can.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Could you explain, Mr. Belmont, this procedure of placing a\r\nstop in the files that you just referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We merely notify our identification division to place what\r\nwe call a flash notice in the man's fingerprint file, which means that\r\nshould he be arrested and the fingerprints be sent to the FBI, that the\r\nappropriate division, in this case the domestic intelligence division,\r\nwould be notified that the man had been arrested, for what and where he\r\nwas arrested, thus enabling us to center our attention on him.\r\n\r\nOur next interest in this man arose as a result of the fact that his\r\nmother had sent, I believe, $25 to him in Moscow, so we went to her in\r\nApril 1960 and we talked to her. At that time she told us that he had\r\ntold her that he would possibly attend the Albert Schweitzer College in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nSo as a followup, we had our legal attache in Paris make inquiry to see\r\nwhether he had enrolled in this college. The resultant check showed\r\nthat while they had expected him and a deposit had been placed that he\r\ndid not show up at the college.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think that is all covered in quite adequate detail in the\r\nanswer to the first question.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have one question I would like to put to you on the first\r\nquestion and answer in your letter of April 6, in Exhibit 833--the\r\nBureau's letter of April 6. You refer, first, to the fact that the\r\nfirst news you got about Oswald was from a news service item, and then\r\nlater on at the bottom of the second full paragraph you state, \"A file\r\nconcerning Oswald was prepared and as communications were received from\r\nother U.S. Government agencies those communications were placed in his\r\nfile.\"\r\n\r\nThe record may show the other communications, I guess our record does\r\nshow, but do you feel that you adequately were advised by the State\r\nDepartment as this case developed or by the CIA or other agencies that\r\nmight have known about it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes. We received a number of communications from other\r\nagencies, and we set up a procedure whereby we periodically checked the\r\nState Department passport file to be kept advised of his activities or\r\nhis dealings with the Embassy in Moscow so that on a periodic basis we\r\nwere sure we had all information in the State Department file.\r\n\r\nWe received communications from the Navy, and from other agencies.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there any general procedure with respect to Americans\r\nabroad who get into trouble. Do you get informed so in case they come\r\nback you can take adequate precautionary measures? Is that established\r\nSOP?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, Mr. Dulles. We do receive such information, and if we\r\npick up the information initially as we did here, from press reports or\r\notherwise, we go to the other agencies and ask them whether they have\r\nany information and establish an interest there so that if they have\r\nnot voluntarily furnished us the information they will do so upon our\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On page 3, Mr. Belmont, in the answer to question No. 3, the\r\nsecond paragraph, could you tell us why the FBI preferred to interview\r\nOswald after he had established residence and why it was not preferable\r\nto interview him upon his arrival in New York?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is a matter of experience. Generally speaking when\r\nan individual such as Oswald arrives back in the country and the\r\npress is there, there is an unusual interest in him. Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service has a function to perform, and we prefer, unless\r\nthere is a matter of urgency, to let the individual become settled in\r\nresidence. It is a much better atmosphere to conduct the interview, and\r\nto get the information that we seek. If it is a matter of urgency, we\r\nwill interview him immediately upon arrival.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On page 4, Mr. Belmont, in your answer to question No. 6,\r\nwas it ordinary procedure for Agent Fain to re-interview Oswald so soon\r\nafter his first interview under the circumstances? Is there anything\r\nunusual about that?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There is nothing unusual whatsoever. Agent Fain\r\ninterviewed Oswald on June 26, 1963--1962, I believe it was, was it not?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And was not satisfied that he had received all the\r\ninformation he wanted nor that it was a matter that should be closed at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he set out a lead to re-interview Oswald, and after an\r\nappropriate period he went back and re-interviewed him. This is within\r\nthe prerogative of the investigative agent, and certainly if he was not\r\nsatisfied with the first interview it was his duty and responsibility\r\nto pursue the matter until he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. In your answer to question No. 5, does the response of\r\nOswald to the question why he went to Russia seem typical to you of the\r\nreturned defector, or unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There is no such thing as a typical response. Each case is\r\nan individual case, and is decided on its merits and on the background\r\nof the individual, and the circumstances surrounding it.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would it be usual for the defector to agree to advise you if\r\nhe got a contact? Are they generally that cooperative?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We ask them because we want to know, and the purpose of\r\nour interview with him was to determine whether he had been recruited\r\nby the Soviet intelligence, and we asked him whether he would tell us\r\nif he was contacted here in this country. He replied he would. Whether\r\nhe meant it is a question. However, you must bear in mind that this\r\nman, I believe it was when he was interviewed in July of 1961 in the\r\nAmerican Embassy, the interviewing official there said it was apparent\r\nthat he had learned his lesson the hard way, and that he had a new\r\nconcept of the American way of life, and apparently had decided that\r\nRussia was not for him.\r\n\r\nWhen we interviewed him likewise he told us that he had not enjoyed\r\nhis stay in Russia. He likewise commented that he had not enjoyed his\r\nstay in the Marines. So that in direct answer to your question, it is\r\ncustomary for us in such a case as this, to ask the man if he will\r\nreport a contact, and it is customary for him to say yes, because\r\nfrankly, he would be putting himself in a rather bad light if he didn't\r\nsay yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Turning to----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question there: Do I correctly read your\r\nreport and those of your agents to the general effect that you had no\r\nevidence that there was any attempt to recruit Oswald in the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No evidence whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Question 8, Mr. Belmont, on page 5, sets out the information\r\nfrom a report by Agent Hosty regarding alleged Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee activity by Oswald while he was still residing in Dallas.\r\nHave you found that an investigation was conducted to determine whether\r\nthat was accurate and do you think it should have been investigated?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. As to whether he was active with the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee in Dallas? We did check. We have rather excellent coverage\r\nof such activities. There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that\r\nhe was active with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in Dallas. And,\r\nas a matter of fact, I can go a step further and say that following\r\nhis dissemination of pamphlets and his activities in New Orleans, our\r\ninquiry of our sources who are competent to tell us what is going on in\r\nthe organizations such as Fair Play for Cuba Committee, advised that\r\nhe was not known to them in New Orleans. So that his activities in New\r\nOrleans were of his own making, and not as a part of the organized\r\nactivities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. On that point, Mr. Belmont, where did he get his material,\r\nthe printed material that he was distributing? Must he not have gotten\r\nthat from some headquarters?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. It is my recollection that he had that printed up himself.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All of it, so far as you know, was self-induced, so to\r\nspeak?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Does your answer imply, Mr. Belmont, that there were Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba activities in Dallas and New Orleans that you knew about?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; we do not have information of Fair Play for Cuba\r\nactivities in Dallas nor any organized activity in New Orleans. So that\r\nthis letter that you refer to, which was undated, was, as in so many\r\nthings that Oswald wrote, not based on fact.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On page 7 in the answer to question 12, you refer to the\r\ninconsistencies and contradictions between the information Oswald gave\r\nto Agent Quigley when he interviewed him in the New Orleans jail and\r\nthe facts as they were known to the FBI before that, and say that \"in\r\nthe event the investigation of Oswald warranted a further interview,\r\nthese discrepancies would have been discussed with him.\"\r\n\r\nCan you explain why the fact of these inconsistencies and\r\ncontradictions and perhaps outright lies to Agent Quigley was not\r\nitself reason for a further interview?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Let me turn this just a little bit and say why should we\r\nre-interview him?\r\n\r\nOur interest in this man at this point was to determine whether his\r\nactivities constituted a threat to the internal security of the\r\ncountry. It was apparent that he had made a self-serving statement to\r\nAgent Quigley. It became a matter of record in our files as a part of\r\nthe case, and if we determined that the course of the investigation\r\nrequired us to clarify or face him down with this information, we would\r\ndo it at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling\r\nus something that wasn't true, and unless this required further\r\ninvestigation at that time, we would handle it in due course, in accord\r\nwith the whole context of the investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Do you know whether the fact of these contradictions was\r\ncalled to the attention of the Dallas office at the time of Oswald's\r\nreturn to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The entire file, of course, or the pertinent serials were\r\nsent to Dallas at the time that the case was transferred back to Dallas\r\nso they would have that information.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I gather what you are saying is they would note the\r\ncontradictions from the reports?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. In the answer to question 14 on page 8, again in connection\r\nwith these inconsistencies, the letter reads \"These inconsistencies\r\nwere considered in subsequent investigation.\"\r\n\r\nCan you expand on that and tell us how they were considered?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is right along the line of my previous explanation\r\nto you, namely, that they were recorded in the file. In the event it\r\nwas desired to talk to him further at a future date, they would be\r\nconsidered as to whether we desired to have him further explain.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On page 12, in response to question 22, which asked for\r\nan explanation of the reason for the investigation to ascertain his\r\nwhereabouts, the letter reads, \"In view of Oswald's background and\r\nactivities the FBI had a continuing interest in him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of that continuing interest at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. On August 21, 1963, because of his activities in\r\ndistributing these pamphlets, and his arrest in New Orleans,\r\nheadquarters here in Washington sent a letter to the New Orleans and\r\nDallas offices instructing them to pursue the investigation. In other\r\nwords, in evaluating this information we felt it desirable that we\r\nfurther explore his activities to determine whether they were inimical\r\nto the internal security of the country. So that we had this continuing\r\ninterest based on our evaluation, and so instructed our field offices.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Chairman, I believe the answers to the other questions\r\ngive us a complete enough record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. May this exhibit which has been marked 833 for\r\nidentification be admitted?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted in evidence under that number.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 833\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Is there anything else, Mr. Belmont, that you may want to\r\nadd? You have already been asked this question as you went through all\r\nthese questions and answers, but is there anything else you would like\r\nto add in view of your answers this morning in further elaboration of\r\nthe answers that have been given?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; unless the Commission has further questions at\r\nthis point, I believe that the questions are answered properly and\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You think that if you are interviewing a defector which is\r\nsomething that provokes your interest, and I guess the mere fact of\r\ndefection and return to the United States would do so, and if you found\r\nthat defector was lying to you, you think that without something in\r\naddition to that there would be no further necessity of examining him.\r\nIs that a fair question? Let me put it another way.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I have just a little difficulty following you.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Here is my point. Here was a defector who comes within the\r\ncategory of interesting cases naturally.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And you question him and you find he is lying to you. At\r\nthat stage, as I understand your testimony, you say without something\r\nmore you don't necessarily go any further, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; that is not correct. We had talked to this man twice\r\nin detail concerning the question of possible recruitment by Soviet\r\nintelligence. We had checked his activities. He was settling down. He\r\nhad a wife and a child. He had, according to what he had told us, in\r\nour interview with him, he had not enjoyed his stay in Russia. The\r\nState Department evaluation of him in Moscow was that he had learned\r\nhis lesson and, as a matter of fact, he had made some statement to the\r\neffect that he now recognized the value of the American way of life,\r\nalong those lines.\r\n\r\nSo that we had pretty well settled that issue. At the time that we\r\ninterviewed him in the jail in New Orleans, we had again been following\r\nhis activities because of his communications, his contacts with The\r\nWorker and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and our interest there was\r\nto determine whether he was a dangerous subversive. The interview in\r\nthe jail was very apparently a self-serving interview in an attempt\r\nto explain his activities in the New Orleans area, and if I recall\r\ncorrectly, he took the position that the policy as directed against\r\nCuba was not correct, and that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was\r\nmerely addressing itself to the complaints of Cuba, and was not in\r\neffect a subversive organization.\r\n\r\nIf, Mr. McCloy, during those first two interviews where we were\r\npursuing this matter of him being a defector and his recruitment, he\r\nhad lied to us, and the agent was not satisfied we would have pursued\r\nit to the bitter end. Or if during any other time information came to\r\nour attention which indicated a necessity to pursue that further we\r\nwould have pursued it to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You speak of this as a self-serving interview. Do you think\r\nthat he sought the interview with you, with Mr. Quigley eventually,\r\nbecause he had known of the prior contacts that he had had with the\r\nFBI, and he simply wanted to keep out of trouble?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I don't know why he asked to see an agent. I simply do not\r\nknow why.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, I show you a letter marked for identification\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 834. Can you identify that for the Commission,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 834 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is a letter dated May 4, 1964, addressed to the\r\nCommission which sets forth in summary the contents of the headquarters\r\nfile on Oswald prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Do you have that file with you?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would you explain generally to the Commission what materials\r\nthere are in that file that for security reasons you would prefer not\r\nto disclose?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The file contains the identity of some of our informants\r\nin subversive movements. It contains information as to some of the\r\ninvestigative techniques whereby we were able to receive some of the\r\ninformation which has been made available to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think that is enough, Mr. Belmont, on that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You didn't have anything further to add to that, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think as to those things if it is agreeable to the\r\nother members of the Commission, we will not pursue any questioning\r\nthat will call for an answer that would divulge those matters that you\r\nhave just spoken of.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I would like to make it clear, Mr. Chairman, that--I think\r\nthat is very kind of you--I would like to make it clear that Mr. Hoover\r\nhas expressed a desire to be of the utmost help to the Commission,\r\nand to make any information available that will be helpful to the\r\nCommission. I think your observation is very much worthwhile.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, have you reviewed the actual file and this\r\nletter of May 4 which summarizes each document in the file?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And to your knowledge, is this an accurate summary of each\r\npiece of information in the file?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The file is available to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. If they want to look at any item in it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The file does not include that security matter that you\r\nmentioned, or does it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This file is as it is maintained at the Bureau with all\r\ninformation in it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. With all information in it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; this is the actual file.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Belmont, are you willing to leave the file a reasonable\r\ntime in case any of the Commissioners desire to examine it personally?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We will return it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I wonder if we do want it on those conditions. If we want\r\nto get anything from it don't you think, Mr. Rankin, that we ought\r\nto make it known here while the witness is here. I personally don't\r\ncare to have this information that involves our security unless it is\r\nnecessary, and I don't want to have documents in my possession where it\r\ncould be assumed that I had gotten that information and used it, so I\r\nwould rather, I would rather myself confine our questions to this file\r\nto the testimony of Mr. Belmont. Then if we want it, if we want any of\r\nthose things, it then becomes a matter to discuss here in the open, and\r\nnot just in privacy.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I felt it made a better record if the file is\r\navailable only to the Commissioners in case they do want to examine it,\r\nand then it will be taken back and the staff will not examine it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think he has stated that the file will be made\r\navailable to us whenever we want it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If we do want it to read it that is one thing. For\r\nmyself, I think we can get what we want from examining the witness,\r\nand then if there is any portion of it that comes into play why we can\r\ndetermine the question here, but I really would prefer not to have a\r\nsecret file, I mean a file that contains matters of that kind in our\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There is one factor that I wanted to get before the\r\nCommission and in the record, and that is that you had all the\r\ninformation that the FBI had in regard to this matter, and I thought\r\nthat was important to your proceedings, so that we would not retain\r\nsuch a file, and we had an accurate summary but that it is available\r\nso that the Commission can be satisfied that nothing was withheld from\r\nit in regard to this particular question. That was the purpose of the\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I assume, Mr. Belmont, if later other testimony arises that\r\nwould make us desire to refer to this file we could consult it in your\r\noffices or you would make it available to us?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think I would personally rather have it done on that\r\nbasis. What do you think, Mr. McCloy?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I was just glancing at the file, and it seems to have the\r\nregular, the usual type of reports that we have seen. But there is a\r\ngood bit of elaboration in those, in that file of the summary which\r\nis here. This summary I don't think can purport to be a complete\r\ndescription of the documents that are in here, as I glance through them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI just happened to see a good bit of detail in here which doesn't have\r\nanything to do with the security problem we talked about, but I would\r\nthink that probably it would be wise for some member of the Commission\r\nor members of the Commission as a whole, to run through that file in\r\norder to be sure that we have seen the material elements of the file\r\nthat we would not perhaps, might not, be able to get from this letter\r\nof May 4.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, there are so many of these questions in here that\r\nare obviously matters that we would have no more concern with than just\r\nto know about them.\r\n\r\nStart from the very beginning, a news clipping from the Corpus Christi\r\nTimes, dated October 2, 1959. Now if that excites any interest on the\r\npart of any member, why we could say, \"Well, could you show us that?\"\r\nThen the next is the United Press release, dated October 31 at Moscow,\r\nand a great many of these.\r\n\r\nNow, I wonder if it wouldn't be better for us to look over all of these\r\nvarious things, items that are in the file, and then if there are any\r\nthat happen to excite our interest, we can ask Mr. Belmont about it.\r\nIf it is a matter that involves security, we could then discuss it and\r\nmake our determination as to whether we wanted to see it. I would think\r\nthat when we are dealing with things that are as sensitive as the FBI\r\nhas to deal with in that respect, that that would be adequate; that is\r\nmy opinion of it.\r\n\r\nBut if the rest of the Commission feel that they want to see it\r\nnotwithstanding the security measure, I would, of course, have no\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, what I was trying to deal with was a\r\nclaim by someone that the Commission never saw all there was in the\r\nhands of the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald, and we recognize that some\r\nof these items should not be considered important by anyone, as we look\r\nat the matter, but we wanted you to be able to satisfy the public and\r\nthe country that whatever there was that the FBI had, the Commission\r\nhad it, and we didn't think that in light of the security problems\r\nthe whole file should be a part of the files of the Commission. And\r\nwe tried to present here a summary, even of items that did not seem\r\nimportant, but we did want the record in such condition that the\r\nCommission could say in its report, \"We have seen everything that they\r\nhave.\" I think it is important to the case.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I notice, Mr. Belmont, in running through this file, a note\r\nhere that symbols are used in instances where the identities of the\r\nsources must be concealed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. If that is so----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. In some instances.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Only in some instances. There are other cases where that is\r\nnot the case.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. There is a great deal of narrative in here about Oswald and\r\nhis relations with the Embassy. Maybe it is elsewhere in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I would presume that you have received that from the other\r\nagencies. Those are copies of communications that the other agencies\r\nsent to us.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, why couldn't we go over this list and see what\r\nitems we would be interested in and then we can determine, can we not,\r\nwhether we want----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I am not so sure, you can look through this yourself, I am\r\nnot so sure if from reading just that short summary you get the full\r\nimpact of all the narrative that is in the various reports. There is a\r\ngood bit here. For example, one page I have here about this business of\r\nbeating his wife and the drinking. There is a good bit of detail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Mr. McCloy, you have that record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We have the record, I have read the records myself.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Maybe we have that one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Any investigative report you have.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Is there any investigative report in here that we have not\r\ngot?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We are trying to develop, Mr. Chief Justice and\r\nCommissioners, that you have everything that the FBI had, this is their\r\ntotal file in regard to this matter of Lee Harvey Oswald so that there\r\nis nothing withheld from you as far as the FBI is concerned. That is\r\npart of what we are trying to develop this morning, in addition to the\r\nitems themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if the staff, Mr. Rankin, could not go over this\r\nand check over those items we have from other sources and what the FBI\r\nhas already furnished us so what we deal with with respect to this file\r\nare only items that are not in the Commission's records, already. That\r\nwould cut this down by half, I would imagine or more.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; we could do that for you.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Then we could have this available possibly at a later date\r\njust to check over the other items against your files to see if there\r\nis any information there that we really need.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You could come back, couldn't you, Mr. Belmont?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I am at your disposal.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that would be better. I think, Mr. Rankin, your\r\npurpose is entirely laudable here, but I think we do have to use some\r\ndiscretion in the matter, and you say that you want it so we can say we\r\nhave seen everything. Well, the same people who would demand that we\r\nsee everything of this kind would also demand that they be entitled to\r\nsee it, and if it is security matters we can't let them see it. It has\r\nto go back to the FBI without their scrutiny.\r\n\r\nSo unless, I would say, unless there is something that we think\r\nhere is vital to this situation, that it isn't necessary for us to\r\nsee the whole file, particularly in view of the fact that we have\r\npractically--we have all the reports, he says we have all the reports\r\nthat are in that file, and it just seems like thrashing old straw to go\r\nover it and over it again.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do we have copies of all these telegrams that are in here\r\nfrom the Embassy?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. You are looking at----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Not Embassy; here is one from Mexico. Do we have that? We\r\ndon't have these in our files, for example.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is subsequent to the assassination. You see your area\r\nof interest at this point is information, all information we had prior\r\nto the assassination. I did not remove from this file the items that\r\nstarted to come in subsequent to the assassination, you see.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. My feeling is that somebody on the Commission should\r\nexamine that file. I can't come to any other conclusion after reading\r\nit all, because I don't know what is in it, what is in our record,\r\nand what is in that file. There is a good bit of material there that\r\nis narrative, which I think would be relevant. Certainly, I don't\r\nbelieve we can be possibly criticized for deleting or not producing\r\na file which contains the type of information that you are speaking\r\nof. We are just as interested in protecting the security of your\r\ninvestigative processes as you are. But I don't think that when it is\r\non the record that we have this file, that may contain material that\r\nwas not in our files, and we are given the opportunity to examine it,\r\nwithout disclosing these confidential matters that we ought not to have\r\nsomebody go through it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I agree with that but I think we could save time if we\r\nchecked off first what we have already and that would cut out about\r\nhalf of that file probably.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think in a rapid glance through it, I think just about\r\nhalf of it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, suppose you do that then, get those and let's see.\r\nAll right, proceed, Mr. Stern.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think perhaps we ought to leave the entire matter of the\r\nfile then until we can give you the information.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. May we admit for the purposes of the record this list at\r\nthis time, Mr. Chief Justice, which has been marked No. 834?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. There are no security matters in this?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted as Exhibit No. 834.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 834\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, can you identify this letter dated February 6\r\nwith an attached affidavit which has been marked for identification as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 835?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 835, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; this is a letter dated February 6, 1964, to the\r\nCommission from the FBI to which is attached an affidavit by Director\r\nJ. Edgar Hoover.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What is the subject?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Stating flatly that Lee Harvey Oswald was never an\r\ninformant of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you define informant. Obviously in the sense he knew\r\nsome information as previously indicated from the previous interviews.\r\nI mean for the record, would you just define what you mean by an\r\ninformant in this sense?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. An informant in this sense is an individual who has agreed\r\nto cooperate with the FBI and to furnish information to the FBI either\r\nfor or without payment.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This would not, of course, include the cooperative citizen\r\nto whom we go, and who frequently and frankly discloses any information\r\nin his possession, but rather someone who joins an organization or\r\nseeks out information at the direction and instance of the FBI relative\r\nto subversive or criminal matters. In other words, I want to make it\r\nclear we do not regard patriotic citizens as informants.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I take it you also would not have regarded Lee Oswald as an\r\ninformant from the contacts with him that you have told us about and\r\nthe other agents have told us about?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Indeed not; in no way could he be considered an informant;\r\nin no way.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you supervise or assist in the preparation of the\r\ninformation contained here?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you are familiar with it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And to your knowledge, does it accurately and completely\r\nstate the Bureau's practice in recruiting a prospective informant?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is there anything you would like to add to the information\r\ncovered in there with respect to your practices regarding informants?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; only in my personal knowledge this is a correct\r\nstatement and Lee Harvey Oswald was not an informant of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you ever use the term \"agent\" to apply to anyone other\r\nthan an employee, a special agent employee of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; we do not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask you, Mr. Belmont, whether Mr. Fain's separation\r\nfrom the FBI had anything whatever to do with the Oswald case or in his\r\nhandling of the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; indeed not. Mr. Fain came to the retirement age and\r\ndecided he wanted to retire, which is his privilege, and he retired and\r\nis presently working in Texas and very happy, I understand.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. He retired in good graces, good standing, so far as the\r\nFBI is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And a year before the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Frankly, I don't recall.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; it was August 1962, he testified.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You have already covered this, Mr. Belmont, but just so that\r\nthe record is completely clear on this point, was Lee Oswald ever an\r\nagent of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Lee Oswald was never an agent of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The letter of February 6, 1964, from Mr. Hoover, alludes to\r\ntestimony furnished the Commission by District Attorney Wade. Have you\r\nsubsequently been advised that Mr. Wade had not testified before the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; we received a letter from the Commission advising us\r\nthat the incident referred to was an informal discussion rather than\r\nactual testimony before the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And also to complete the record, have you been advised that\r\nMr. Wade was not suggesting that he believed the rumor about Oswald\r\nas an informant, but felt obliged to call it to the attention of the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The Commission's letter so advised us.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Chairman, may this be admitted with No. 835?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted under that number.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 835\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, I show you a letter dated February 12, 1964,\r\na number of affidavits by special agents, attached to it. It was\r\nidentified yesterday, parts of it were identified yesterday and it\r\ntherefore carries the number for identification 825. Can you identify\r\nthis letter for us?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. In order to be sure--I beg your pardon. This is a letter\r\ndated February 12, 1964, to the Commission from the FBI, to which is\r\nattached affidavits of FBI personnel who had reason to contact Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and who were in a supervisory capacity over the agents\r\nwho contacted Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you supervise the preparation of this material?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. These affidavits were prepared, of course, by the men\r\nthemselves. I have read the affidavits, and they were compiled as an\r\nenclosure and sent over with this letter.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You have reviewed them in preparation for your testimony\r\nbefore the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. To your knowledge, are they accurate?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. They are accurate, to my knowledge, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Are they complete?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. They do not omit any significant fact you know of?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. In connection with the material they cover?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Unless there are any questions on that, Mr. Chairman, I\r\nsuggest we admit this document.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted as No. 825.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 825\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, I show you a letter dated March 31, 1964, from\r\nDirector Hoover to Mr. Rankin, the General Counsel of the Commission,\r\nwith a series of attachments. Can you identify this which has been\r\nmarked for identification as No. 836. Can you identify this for the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 836 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is a letter dated March 31, 1964, to the Commission\r\nfrom the FBI to which is attached the instructions contained in our\r\nmanuals as to the type of information which should be disseminated to\r\nSecret Service and our relations or liaison with Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. It was prepared in response to a request from the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you supervise or assist in the preparation?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Have you reviewed it recently?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is it complete with respect to the matters covered?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is there anything you would like to add to it with respect\r\nto the matters covered?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I just interrupt here a moment. Is this inquiry\r\ndirected to the question of whether it is now adequate or whether this\r\nis complete as of the time of the assassination? I think we have two\r\nquestions there to consider.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Mr. Dulles, this letter outlines our relations with Secret\r\nService and the material that is attached covers both the instructions\r\nto our agents prior to the assassination and the current instructions.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Subsequent to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What were the criteria you employed and instructed your\r\nagents to employ before the assassination in determining what\r\ninformation should be reported to the Secret Service regarding threats\r\nagainst the President, members of his family, the President-elect, and\r\nthe Vice President?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. These are contained in detail in the attachments which\r\nrepresent sections of our manual of instructions which are available to\r\nall of our personnel in the field as well as the seat of Government,\r\nand also in the FBI handbook which is in possession of the individual\r\nagent in the field. These instructions require that any information\r\nindicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety\r\nof the persons mentioned by you must be referred immediately by the\r\nmost expeditious means of communications to the nearest office of the\r\nSecret Service. Further, that our headquarters in Washington must be\r\nadvised by teletype of the information and the fact that it has been\r\nfurnished to Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Specifically, the kind of information you were interested\r\nin, that is before the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes. Specifically the kind?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Any information indicating the possibility of a threat\r\nagainst the President and Vice President and members of the family.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Have you broadened----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I may say, sir----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That this practice was assiduously followed, and you will\r\nfind that the files of the Secret Service are loaded with information\r\nover the years that we have furnished them. That was a practice\r\nreligiously followed and a practice voluntarily followed without\r\nrequest. In other words, we do not have a written request for this type\r\nof information but rather considered it our responsibility and duty to\r\nfurnish this information.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you ever participate in or do you know of any discussion\r\nwith the Secret Service before the assassination regarding the kind of\r\ninformation they were interested in?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We had close liaison with Secret Service, and I have no\r\ndoubt that in oral discussions that the question came up. I wasn't\r\npresent but I would assume it has come up, particularly as we were\r\nconstantly furnishing information. We have no written criteria, you\r\nmight say, as to what should be furnished.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is, established by the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you yourself never participated in any discussion of----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This liaison function.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. This is something we have done for years on the basis that\r\nwe consider it our responsibility not only as far as the President\r\ngoes. As you know, Mr. Chairman, we have also followed the same policy\r\nrelative to other high officials when it appears desirable.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Have you subsequent to the assassination augmented your\r\ninstructions to special agents in this respect?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes. On December 26, 1963, we prepared additional\r\ninstructions reiterating those already in effect, and adding other\r\ndissemination to Secret Service concerning the security of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where do those new ones appear in the exhibit, Mr.\r\nBelmont?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. They appear as an attachment--working from the back, I\r\nthink, Mr. Chairman, I can help you most.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Eight pages from the back it starts, it reads, \"Manual of\r\nInstructions Section 83.\"\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; I have it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The first page is the same information that we previously\r\nfurnished to Secret Service involving threats.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The first page is intact, as it was before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There may be some slight changes in wording but\r\nessentially it is the same dealing with possible threats.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Belmont, I wonder if it would be possible for the\r\nCommission's convenience to date each one of these papers as of a\r\ncertain date. It is quite difficult going through it now without\r\nreferring to the letter in each case to determine whether the\r\ninstructions are as of the date of the assassination or as of the\r\npresent date?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We can do that without any difficulty. I would be glad to\r\ndo it with the staff, or can I help you here?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, I think we can do that later but I think it would\r\nbe useful when this goes into the record for our later reference in\r\nstudying this to have those dates available to us on each one of the\r\nattachments.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Very good.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Coming back to this item you inquired about, sir,\r\nthe other dissemination to Secret Service concerning the security\r\nof the President is set forth on pages 2 and 3 of this inclusion\r\nin our manual, and it extends the dissemination to \"subversives,\r\nultrarightists, racists, and fascists, (_a_) possessing emotional\r\ninstability or irrational behavior, (_b_) who have made threats of\r\nbodily harm against officials or employees of Federal, State or local\r\ngovernment or officials of a foreign government, (_c_) who express\r\nor have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments and who\r\nhave been involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct\r\nindicates tendencies toward violence, and (_d_) whose prior acts or\r\nstatements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized\r\ngovernment.\" That was prepared in an effort to provide additional, and\r\na voluntary effort, without request, to provide additional information\r\nthat might be helpful to avoid such an incident as happened November\r\n22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This did not come about, this change did not come about,\r\nthrough any request from the Secret Service or discussion with the\r\nSecret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No. We made these changes, as I say, in an effort to\r\nprovide any additional information in the light of what happened that\r\nmight be of assistance to Secret Service and might assist in protecting\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder, Mr. Belmont, whether you would consider possibly\r\nchanging in section (_d_) the word \"and\" to \"or\" whose prior acts or\r\nstatements depict propensity for violence\" and then it now reads \"and\r\nhatred against organized government\". There have been cases, I believe,\r\nwhere the propensity for violence had not been previously noted but the\r\nhatred of organized government has.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We will be happy to change that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I just suggest for your consideration, I don't wish to\r\nrewrite it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We would be happy to change it, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Following Mr. Dulles' thought, in the line above that, Mr\r\nBelmont, should that \"and\" before (_d_) be \"and\" or \"or\"? Do you mean\r\nthese----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We do not mean that all of these items must be coupled\r\ntogether if that is your thought.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We will be happy to change the \"and\" before (d) to an \"or\".\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This means any of the broad classifications of people,\r\nsubversives, ultrarightists, racists or fascists who meet any of these\r\nfour tests.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Can you give the Commission some notion of the increase in\r\nvolume which the broadening of your criteria has brought about? By\r\nvolume, I mean the volume of your references to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I do not have an exact figure, however, I do know that\r\nmore than 5,000 additional names have gone over to Secret Service under\r\nthese criteria.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In what period of time?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Since we put them out.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Which was December 26.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Have you included defectors in this list?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; we do include defectors.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You mean as of December 26, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Has the expansion of your criteria led to any problem or\r\ndifficulty for you or for individuals or do you anticipate any problem\r\nor difficulty under the expanded criteria?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. It seems to me that there is a necessity to balance\r\nsecurity against freedom of the individual. This is a country of laws\r\nand a government of law, and not a government of men. Inevitably the\r\nincrease in security means an increase in the control of the individual\r\nand a diminishment, therefore, of his individual liberties. It is\r\na simple matter to increase security. But every time you increase\r\nsecurity you diminish the area of the rights of the individual. In\r\nsome countries the problem of a visiting dignitary is met without much\r\ndifficulty. Persons who are suspect or may be considered dangerous\r\nare immediately rounded up and detained while the individual is in the\r\ncountry. The authorities have no problem because in those countries\r\nthere is not a free society such as we enjoy, and the people who are\r\ndetained have no redress. The FBI approaches this whole field of\r\nsecurity--I am not boring you with this, am I?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No, indeed. This is tremendously important.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The FBI approaches this whole field of security and its\r\ntremendous responsibilities to protect the internal security of the\r\ncountry as a sacred trust. In carrying out our investigations and our\r\nwork in the security field, we do it in such a manner under the law\r\nthat we strengthen rather than weaken the free society that we enjoy.\r\nIt is for that reason that our men are trained carefully, thoroughly,\r\nand supervised carefully, to insure that their approach to the entire\r\nsecurity field, which inevitably touches on control of thought, is\r\nhandled with extreme care. Our activities are directed to meet the\r\nterrific responsibility we have for the internal security of the\r\ncountry, but to meet it under the law. We feel that to place security\r\nas such above the rights of the individual or to increase these\r\ncontrols beyond what is absolutely essential is the first step toward\r\nthe destruction of this free society that we enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe have been asked many times why we don't pick up and jail all\r\nCommunists. The very people who ask those questions don't realize that\r\nif action, unrestrained action, is taken against a particular group\r\nof people, a precedent is set which can be seized on in the future by\r\npower-hungry or unscrupulous authorities as a precedent, and which\r\ninevitably will gnaw away at this free society we have, and sooner or\r\nlater will be applied to the very individuals who are seeking this\r\naction. Up until the time of the assassination we religiously and\r\ncarefully and expeditiously furnished to Secret Service immediately\r\non a local basis as well as on a national basis, headquarters basis,\r\nany and all information that in any way was indicated to be a possible\r\nthreat against the President. This permitted Secret Service to take\r\nsuch action as was required against these individuals who had by\r\ntheir action set the stage for appropriate restraint or observation\r\nbased on something they did. Therefore, they were not in a position\r\nto complain legitimately because they had by some word or deed set\r\nin motion a threat against the President of the United States. Since\r\nthe assassination, as I have testified, we have broadened the area of\r\ndissemination in an effort to be helpful. It stands without question\r\nthat we could have said, \"No; we won't go any further.\" But we felt\r\nthat it was our responsibility to do whatever we could do and, hence,\r\nwe have broadened these criteria, and we have distributed thousands of\r\npieces of information on individuals to Secret Service.\r\n\r\n(At this point in the proceedings, Representative Ford enters the\r\nhearing room.)\r\n\r\nWe are not entirely comfortable about this, because under these\r\nbroadened criteria after all we are furnishing names of people who have\r\nnot made a threat against the President, people who have expressed\r\nbeliefs, who have belonged or do belong to organizations which believe\r\nin violent revolution or taking things into their own hands. Unless\r\nsuch information is handled with judgment and care, it can be dangerous.\r\n\r\nFor example, we know that in one city when the President recently\r\nvisited, the police went to these people and told them, \"You stay in\r\nthe house while the President is here or if you go out, we will go with\r\nyou.\" We know that these people have threatened to consult attorneys,\r\nhave threatened to make a public issue of the matter on the theory that\r\nthis is restraint that is not justified as they have made no threats\r\nagainst the President. Now, when you examine this a bit further, we\r\ngive these names to Secret Service. Secret Service must do something\r\nwith those names, and Secret Service solicits the assistance of the\r\npolice, quite properly. But I don't need, I think, to paint this\r\npicture any further, that when you get away from a specific act or deed\r\nof threats against the President, and you go into the broader area of\r\nwhat, perhaps, a man is thinking and, therefore, he may be a threat,\r\nand you take action against the man on the basis of that, there is a\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThat is why, despite the fact that we have given this additional\r\ninformation and will continue to do so, we are uneasy. Again, if I\r\nmay be permitted to continue, this is inherent in the entire approach\r\nof the FBI to the security field. We go as far in our investigations\r\nas is necessary. But we go no further. We do not harass people.\r\nWe do not conduct an investigation of a man for what he may be\r\nthinking. We attempt to the very best of our ability to carry out\r\nthis responsibility for internal security without adopting tactics\r\nof harassment or unwarranted investigation, and we will not pursue\r\na security matter beyond that which is essential to carry out our\r\nresponsibilities. Now, I say that because that is the broad field of\r\nour policy, and I say it with complete sincerity, because I know. I\r\nhave been in this work with the FBI both in the actual investigative\r\nfield and in the policymaking and supervisory field for 27 years, and\r\nI know the policies and the procedures that are followed, and the care\r\nwith which this problem is approached, and I agree with it fully.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You are going to impose a pretty heavy burden on the Secret\r\nService when you dump them with the 5,000 more names than they have\r\nbeen used to having.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. It will be more than 5,000, sir. This will continue.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. From your knowledge of the situation, do you feel that\r\nthe Secret Service is equipped to cope with this added burden? Is it\r\nsomething that you feel----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The Secret Service, as it has in the past, is required\r\nto call on the police for assistance in this field when the President\r\nvisits a city. I do not know the exact complement of personnel of\r\nSecret Service, but they are a relatively small organization.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be they will have to reorganize some of their\r\nprocedures to cope with this, won't they?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You have got a pretty broad classification here. \"All\r\ninvestigative personnel should be alert for the identification of\r\nsubversives, ultrarightists, racists, and Fascists (_a_) possessing\r\nemotional instability or irrational behavior.\" That may include a\r\ngood many people in the United States and maybe some members of this\r\nCommission--I am speaking for myself. There is irrational behavior that\r\nI have been guilty of many times. [Laughter.] This doesn't mean you\r\nare going to send everybody over there, but the names that--all those\r\nunder your classification, all of those in your opinion come under that\r\nclassification unless you feel they have some, there is some, reason\r\nbehind it. In other words, you are selective in this list. You purport\r\nto be selective in the numbers that you are going to convey to, the\r\nnames you are going to convey to, the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We endeavor to use good judgment, sir. Now, as you\r\nindicate there are what, 190 million people in this country, and who\r\nknows when someone may adopt abnormal behavior.\r\n\r\nYou cannot tell tomorrow who will pose a risk. This is an effort to be\r\nas helpful as possible and, as we have in the past, we will use our\r\nbest judgment. But this will broaden considerably the type of people\r\nand the number of people who go to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is what I am getting at really, Mr. Belmont. You are\r\nnot saying that all those people that you characterize here under\r\nthis paragraph 2 will ipso facto be sent over to the Secret Service\r\nevery time the President makes a move. This simply says that all\r\ninvestigative personnel should be alert in that situation; am I right\r\nin that?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir. If you will follow in the next paragraph, we say,\r\n\"If cases are developed falling within the above categories, promptly\r\nfurnish Secret Service locally a letterhead memorandum\" with the\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. So without any further ado all the people in your list who\r\nare in that category will be transferred over to the Secret Service\r\nwhen there is an occasion, when the President travels?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No. This is a continuing procedure. In other words, during\r\nour investigations we come across someone who is in this area or\r\ncategory, and this is a requirement that that man's name go to Secret\r\nService with a brief description of him, and Secret Service then has\r\nthat filed and is in a position to know that that individual has been\r\nreferred to them.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Well, that brings up again the comment that I originally\r\nmade. This does put a big burden of investigation and judgment on\r\nthe Secret Service, one which they have not heretofore presumably had\r\nplaced on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I think you are correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. The reason I am asking these questions is because by\r\nimplication, at least, one of our directives is to look into this\r\nsituation for the future protection of the President, and we want to\r\nsee that we have got something that is practical as well as cautious.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do the memoranda attached, Mr. Belmont, to this exhibit\r\nindicate what classes were so identified for investigation under the\r\nprocedures existing at the time of the assassination and what change\r\nhas been made, how it has been extended?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir. If you----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By the definitions under paragraph 2 of the Manual of\r\nInstructions.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The previous page and the paragraph right above No. 2 sets\r\nforth the same information that we acted on prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is paragraph 1?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Manual of Instructions, section 83.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What are the various categories given now at the top of\r\npage 2 of this exhibit which have been added?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. At the top of page 2, sir, that is the information that\r\nshould be included in the notification to headquarters as to who the\r\nindividual is and the background information that was furnished to\r\nSecret Service so that we, too, can disseminate to Secret Service here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Under the new criteria would Oswald's name have\r\ngone to the Secret Service automatically?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Well, Congressman, right now we are including all\r\ndefectors automatically.\r\n\r\nNow, the question whether Oswald meets these criteria here as set\r\nforth is a question of judgment. As I say, right now we do furnish all\r\ndefectors.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Defectors are for the time being at least a\r\nspecial category other than what is set forth here unless for some\r\nother reason they would fall into one of these categories.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you under that category send forward all Communists?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All Communists, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether or not it would be wise\r\nfor the record at this point to read into the record, in view of the\r\nimportance of this, this paragraph which we are now discussing and\r\nwhich, as I understand it, contains the new definition of investigative\r\ncases?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; we can put it into the record.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Belmont, as I understand it, the new criteria are set\r\nforth in paragraph 2 on page 2 of the Manual of Instructions, section\r\n83; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Which, as I counted, is the 12th page of the Commission's\r\nExhibit No. 836; is that right, Mr. Stern?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is right number of the exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. 836, and I think it is the 12th page.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For convenient reference I suggest that when this be\r\nincluded that we add the dates and the page numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I think the witness can do this immediately.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will give a copy of it to the reporter and he may copy\r\nit and incorporate it later in the record.\r\n\r\n(Paragraph 2 reads as follows:)\r\n\r\n\"Other dissemination to Secret Service concerning security of the\r\nPresident. All investigative personnel should be alert for the\r\nidentification of subversives, ultrarightists, racists, and Fascists\r\n(_a_) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior, (_b_)\r\nwho have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees\r\nof Federal, State, or local government or officials of a foreign\r\ngovernment, (_c_) who express or have expressed strong or violent\r\nanti-U.S. sentiments and who have been involved in bombing or bomb\r\nmaking or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and\r\n(_d_) whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and\r\nhatred against organized government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do I understand you, Mr. Belmont, to say, as drafted\r\nyou would not consider that defectors automatically fell under this\r\nparagraph 2, but it is your practice to notify the Secret Service about\r\ndefectors?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We do notify Secret Service of any defectors coming to our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And by defectors, I guess we mean here maybe a redefector,\r\nmeaning those who have gone to Russia and have come back or maybe those\r\nwho have gone and not come back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. If they haven't come back----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They are not a danger.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. They are not within our cognizance and we don't notify\r\nSecret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These would be defectors who have gone to the Soviet Union\r\nand who then come back to the United States and tried to defect while\r\nthey were over there.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Not necessarily, not exclusively the Soviet Union, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Communist countries, I would say.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Just to get an order of magnitude, how many are\r\nthere? Is this a sizable number?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I don't have a figure, Mr. Ford. You have had defectors in\r\nKorea from the military. You have had defectors----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Berlin. When these are military personnel they are within\r\nthe cognizance of the military, so that it is very difficult for me to\r\ngive you a figure.\r\n\r\nWhen we become interested is when they return to this country and\r\nwarrant action by us from an internal security standpoint.\r\n\r\nAs in the Oswald case, we started our action based on newspaper\r\npublicity that he had attempted to or indicated his intention to,\r\nrenounce his citizenship in Moscow. But I do not have a figure because\r\nmany of these people are members of the armed services and I would\r\nhesitate to give you an estimate.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, do these terms \"subversives, ultrarightists,\r\nracists, and Fascists\" have a particular meaning of art in FBI\r\nparlance? Can you tell us how you use these terms in this regulation or\r\nwhat these mean to you and to your agents.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I will have to refer you to the dictionary, I think, Mr.\r\nStern. A subversive is an individual who is active in the Communist\r\nParty or front groups associated with it or one of the other groups\r\nthat we term subversive, such as the Socialist Workers Party.\r\n\r\nThe ultrarightists----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Socialist Workers Party is a Trotskyite Party, is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe ultrarightists, I believe here we attempt to spell out those people\r\nwho are so far to the right that they do not consider themselves\r\nsubject to the law and the proper procedures, and take things into\r\ntheir own hands.\r\n\r\nThe racists, I think, are--that speaks for itself, individuals who will\r\ngo beyond the bounds of propriety in seeking their goals, and who adopt\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nThe Fascists----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I was wondering how you were going to define that one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Is to give you the opposite end of the spectrum of\r\nsubversives.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do we have anarchists in this country at the present time?\r\nThere used to be an old anarchist society in the old days.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That used to be, but it is dissolved. There is no\r\norganization. I venture to say we have individual anarchists at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. No organized anarchist organization.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, in view of the quite important considerations\r\nyou mentioned before, the danger of interfering with individual\r\nliberty, would it be possible within your organization to have the\r\nagents recommend to headquarters here and have someone at a higher\r\nlevel examine the recommendation before it is made to the Secret\r\nService? This is, as I understand it, a continuing program and not one\r\nthat comes into effect only when the President schedules a trip. This\r\nwould operate without respect to scheduled trips by the President.\r\nWould that be possible? Would it fit your operation? Do you think it\r\nmight help any?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Well, what is your thought behind that, Mr. Stern? In\r\nother words, so that names of persons won't indiscriminately be sent on\r\na local level?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Precisely. These categories are, after all, fairly gross.\r\nThey use large terms which can mean different things to different\r\npeople. The considerations you mention, I think, are quite real and\r\nimportant. Would it help any to do something of the sort?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I think we will find that our agents are using good\r\njudgment in this matter. The danger involved in referring these matters\r\nto headquarters for a decision as to dissemination is the delay in\r\ntime and, you will note, we stress the time element that when such\r\ninformation comes into the possession of our agents, immediate steps\r\nmust be taken to transmit this information to Secret Service by the\r\nmost expeditious means possible.\r\n\r\nThis might be of assistance to you. This information which we send to\r\nSecret Service in the field is placed in a control file, a separate\r\nfile in the field, and is subject, under instructions, to inspection\r\nby our inspectors as they visit our field offices to insure that this\r\nrequirement is being carried out properly; and they will examine the\r\ntype of material that is being sent over.\r\n\r\nEach field office is thoroughly inspected about once a year, and that\r\nis one of the requirements that they go through this to make sure this\r\ninstruction is being properly carried out.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I have no further questions. I have some general questions\r\nI would like to get to at the end, but I have to leave early this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I have one question I wanted to interject, Mr. Chairman,\r\nand that is as to statements, Mr. Belmont, about subversives, including\r\npersons who are members of Communist front groups. You mean to say that\r\nthat includes any person who is a member of a Communist front group\r\nbecause, as you know, many leading citizens have been members of such\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Now, Mr. Rankin, I wouldn't carry it by any means that\r\nfar. It would be dependent upon the front group, the extent of activity\r\nin it, and the activities of the individual. By no means would we\r\nclassify someone as a subversive who was connected with a front group\r\nby name or----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By front groups you mean those on the Attorney General's\r\nlist; you are taking that as a criterion of a front group?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; not necessarily that, sir. There are other groups\r\nthat we consider front groups.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I am glad you raised that because each case would have to\r\nbe considered on its own individual merits as to what is the extent of\r\nthe activity and the purpose and intent of the activity.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You recognize in the work in this field that there are many\r\nAmericans who are interested in certain causes and purposes and front\r\ngroups in connection with them who are loyal Americans, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I have no doubt of that whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I just wanted to get that in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I also know many loyal Americans, unfortunately, who\r\ndon't look behind some of these groups to determine their intents\r\nand purposes, and allow their names to be used where they would not\r\notherwise do so if they took the time and trouble to check into what\r\nthe organization was.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So you don't lump them all under the term \"subversive,\"\r\nthat is what I was trying to get at.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I suppose some join before an organization is\r\ninfiltrated, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They find themselves in a mousetrap then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In other words, you would expect your agents to exert some\r\nselection before they would send these names over to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Our agents use judgment in the pursuance of this work, and\r\nthey would continue to use judgment in the selection of people who meet\r\nthis criterion. Otherwise if you carried this to the extreme you would\r\nget out of hand completely. So that there is judgment applied here and\r\nour agents are capable of applying the judgment.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What has been the reaction of the Secret Service\r\nto this greater flow of information that they have received?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. They have taken it. There has been no official reaction,\r\nto my knowledge.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have they objected to the greater burden?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; I would like to say, I don't know whether you\r\nare going to cover this, Mr. Stern, that our relations with the Secret\r\nService are excellent. We work closely together.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, since the assassination, at the request of\r\nMr. Rowley, we have furnished agents to assist on occasion in the\r\nprotection of the President, which is primarily a function of Secret\r\nService, but as a cooperative gesture we have on a number of occasions\r\nmade agents available at the request of Mr. Rowley. I think the figure\r\nruns to something like 139 agents--yes, 139 agents that we have made\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nWe do have a very close liaison with Secret Service both at the seat\r\nof Government and in our field offices. We have a supervisor here at\r\nthe seat of Government whose duty it is to stay directly in touch\r\nwith Secret Service, to cut redtape and produce results both for\r\nSecret Service and for the FBI; to see that the problems are handled\r\nimmediately. He has direct access to Mr. Rowley, and we have on a\r\nnumber of occasions at the request of Secret Service, sent one of our\r\nagents with the Secret Service when the President travels abroad,\r\nparticularly where we have a representative in the countries being\r\nvisited, because our relations with the law enforcement officials in\r\nthose countries have been built up over the years, and we are thus\r\nin a position to assist Secret Service in establishing the necessary\r\nsecurity measures and the flow of information to serve their purpose.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when the President travels abroad we alert all of our\r\noffices to advise us of any information which may pertain to the travel\r\nof the President, and we set up a supervisor back here to receive\r\nthat information and cable it or get it immediately to our man who is\r\naccompanying the President when he makes this trip.\r\n\r\nThis is done, this agent going with Secret Service is done, at the\r\ninvitation and request of Secret Service.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 169 agents of the FBI who have assisted since the\r\nassassination. Did Secret Service make a specific request for their\r\nhelp in these instances?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; Mr. Rowley advised that he needed help, it was\r\noffered to him by Mr. Hoover, and when the President is going to visit\r\na city and Secret Service does not have sufficient personnel in that\r\nparticular city to cover what they consider is necessary, they need\r\nspecialized help from us, they will make the request to us and we will\r\nauthorize our local agent in charge to make those men, the designated\r\nnumber, available to the Secret Service representative, who then uses\r\ntheir services while the President is there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I gather that prior to the assassination such\r\nrequests, specific requests, had not come from Secret Service to the\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No. There were never any such requests before.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. At the level at which the requests have been made so far,\r\nhave they proved to be a difficult burden for the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Mr. Stern, any time that we have a pending caseload of\r\nsomething like 115,000 investigative matters, which is what we have,\r\nand our agents are assigned about 20 to 25 cases apiece across the\r\ncountry, ranging from matters of immediate urgency to matters which\r\ncan be handled in due time, and whenever our agents are putting in an\r\naverage of over 2 hours overtime a day voluntarily, the loan of 139 men\r\nwill be felt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 169.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I believe it was 139, sir. I think the letter says 139.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. 139 on 16 separate occasions.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes. I do not wish to overplay this. We are not\r\ncomplaining.\r\n\r\nWe do feel that at such time as Secret Service is able to increase\r\nits personnel or meet this problem within the organization that it is\r\nproperly their problem. But meanwhile we are following this procedure\r\nand we are not complaining.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I had hoped, Mr. Chairman, that at some time while Mr.\r\nBelmont was here, we could ask him to just briefly define for us, going\r\nback to the assassination day, a clear definition of the respective\r\nfunctions of the FBI and the Secret Service prior to and immediately\r\nafter the assassination. There seemed to have been at one time a little\r\nconfusion there. Naturally in a situation of this kind it always\r\nhappens, but I am not absolutely clear in my mind as to----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. At the time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes. Just before, I mean what your responsibilities were\r\njust before the assassination, and just after as contrasted with the\r\nfunctions of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The Secret Service has the responsibility for protecting\r\nthe President and his family, and the Vice President and so on. That is\r\na basic responsibility.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you have no auxiliary function to that----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Except to furnish names and suspects, as you have indicated.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct. We have no function there. That is a\r\nprimary responsibility and function of Secret Service.\r\n\r\nNow, we do have what we have considered our responsibility, to furnish\r\nto Secret Service any indication of a threat to the President, and that\r\nwe have done religiously.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination the President ordered us into an investigation\r\nof the assassination which changed the picture as far as this\r\nparticular case was concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You mean President Johnson, immediately after the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And there was a period there, there was a period though,\r\nafter the assassination and before President Johnson took the oath of\r\noffice--did this order come to you during that period or after he had\r\ntaken the oath of office?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. It was very rapid, probably within a day.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see. It wasn't immediately after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It wasn't this period I am speaking of.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. You see, Mr. Dulles, the Federal Government still has no\r\njurisdiction over the assassination of the President. That was a murder\r\nand was within the province of the local police who immediately took\r\nhold of it and started the investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I realize that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And started the investigation and it was theirs.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were only in there by courtesy. What you did was by\r\ncourtesy of the local authorities.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; we went to the Dallas Police Department and\r\nimmediately went into action because of what had happened, and there\r\nwas no time for us to stand on priorities. But we felt we should be\r\nof the utmost assistance, and we sent men to the police department to\r\nassist in the interview and do anything else we could. This wasn't a\r\ntime, of course, to sit back and say, \"This isn't our job.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I understand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Belmont, just one question. Do you know of any\r\nlegislation in recent years that might have been introduced in the\r\nCongress to make an attack upon the President a Federal offense?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I do know that there is legislation presently pending.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Since the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Since the assassination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. But had it been considered in recent years? I know\r\nit had at the time of other assassinations, but so far as you know were\r\nthere any recent legislation to that effect?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Mr. Chairman, I must plead ignorance. I haven't done\r\nresearch on it, and I just don't know.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. Well, we can find that out very easily.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, just the other day in the House of\r\nRepresentatives a bill was approved giving Federal officials the right\r\nto take certain action when a chief of state from a foreign country was\r\nwithin the United States; a broadening of their authority when they had\r\na suspicion or they had some reason to believe that an attack was being\r\nmade on a foreign dignitary.\r\n\r\nAt the time it went through the House I thought of the same question\r\nyou just raised, and I wondered whether there were any specific\r\nlegislative matters pending before any committee on this particular\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I am sure there is a pending bill because my recollection\r\nis that it was called to our attention--I cannot pinpoint it for\r\nyou--but I think there is pending legislation now in this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I noticed in some Law Review article recently reference to\r\nthe fact that previous bills had been introduced but had gone into the\r\nwastebasket.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is true.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In respect of other incidents.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When the emotion died down.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. When the emotion died down, that is true.\r\n\r\nI have some further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you finished, Mr. Stern?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I want to get one thing established that came up yesterday.\r\nMr. Belmont, yesterday the Commission was interested in determining, if\r\npossible, when Agent Hosty recorded the interviews that he had taken on\r\nOctober 29, November 1, and November 5. He wasn't certain, except that\r\nhe thought it had been done after the assassination. Have you caused a\r\ncheck to be made on that?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; we checked with our Dallas office, and they do not\r\nhave a specific record of when that information was recorded.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Was it recorded in substantially the same form in some\r\ncontemporaneous communication?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; within a day or two, I think on November 4, if I\r\nrecall correctly, the fact that Hosty had talked to the neighbor of\r\nMrs. Paine and had located Marina Oswald, was sent in by AIRTEL.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You might refer to Commission Exhibit 834, page 9, items 64\r\nand 67, just so the record is straight.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Item 64 is an AIRTEL from the Dallas office to the\r\nheadquarters dated October 30, wherein Hosty reported this interview\r\nthat he had had with the neighbor of Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nOn November 4 the Dallas office reported by AIRTEL the results of his\r\ncontact with Mrs. Paine on November 1, so that the results of his\r\ninterviews were incorporated at that time, October 30, November 4,\r\nbut the actual insert for the report was not prepared until some time\r\nlater. To the best of Hosty's recollection it was after the 22d and\r\nprior to December 2, but he was already on record by these AIRTELS.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Belmont.\r\n\r\nI have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. McCloy.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I have one or two questions.\r\n\r\nMr. Belmont, you do know the charge has been made by some that Oswald\r\nwas what is called a secret agent. Do you have any information whatever\r\nthat would cause you to believe that Oswald was or could have been an\r\nagent or an informant of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I have covered that in some considerable detail, Mr.\r\nMcCloy, and I will make a positive statement that Oswald was not, never\r\nwas, an agent or an informant of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In the course of your investigation do you have any reason\r\nto make you believe that he was an agent of any other country?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; we have no reason to believe that he was an agent\r\nof any other country.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Or any other agency of the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Or any other agency of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You said this morning, I believe, or at least I guess Mr.\r\nHosty said, that the assassination of the President and any leads in\r\nconnection with it are still of constant concern to the FBI.\r\n\r\nDo you feel there are any areas as of the present time that you feel at\r\nthe present time require or justify further investigation other than\r\nroutine checkups that have not already been undertaken?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; frankly, I don't. I will say that from the\r\nrequests we have received from the Commission, you have explored\r\nthis most thoroughly. We do not have any unexplored areas in this\r\ninvestigation that should be explored. There are some pending requests\r\nthat you have made, and we are running them out as rapidly as we can.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Maybe this isn't a fair question to ask you, but, after\r\nall, you have had a long record of criminal investigation, and you have\r\nhad a long exposure to investigation in this case.\r\n\r\nAs a result of your investigation do you feel that there is any\r\ncredible evidence thus far which would support a conclusion or an\r\nopinion that the death of the President was the result of a conspiracy\r\nor anything other than the act of a single individual?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; we have no evidence, and I could support no\r\nconclusion that this was other than an act of Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Now, the investigation does lead you to the conclusion that\r\nhe was the President's assassin?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you ever at any time have any connection whatever--you\r\nor the agency--have anything to do with the Walker, General Walker,\r\ncase?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; that was a matter handled by the Dallas police. I\r\nam drawing on my recollection of it now, but, as I recall it, after the\r\nincident, we offered to examine the bullets that were recovered----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Bullets.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And the police apparently wanted to retain them, so that\r\nwe did not conduct the examination of the bullets until subsequent to\r\nthe assassination itself.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Until recently.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No; we had no connection with it, with that investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In your investigation of the President's assassination, did\r\nyou have occasion, after the event, to make an investigation of Ruby's\r\nbackground or Ruby's relationship to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; we went into that very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Have we got all your reports on that?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Have you come to any conclusions or opinions in regard to\r\nRuby and his connection with Oswald, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The reports, of course, speak for themselves. But in\r\nsummation, we did not come up with anything of a solid nature, that is\r\nanything that would stand up to indicate that there was any association\r\nbetween Ruby and Oswald. We had numerous allegations which we ran out\r\nextensively and carefully, but there is nothing, no information, that\r\nwould stand up to show there was an association between them.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Maybe this is in the record, but do you--by reason of your\r\nvery close association with this investigation, I venture to ask this\r\nquestion--do you, from your knowledge of the investigation find--was\r\nthere any evidence in regard to Ruby's propensity for violence before\r\nthis shooting took place in the police headquarters in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Did we have any information of that character and of that\r\nnature?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes; I am not talking before it happened, but as a result\r\nof your investigation did you turn up any other indications of any\r\nviolence on the part of Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I hesitate to attempt to evaluate the information that we\r\ngathered from hundreds and hundreds of people that we talked to during\r\nthe investigation of Ruby after the assassination. I just don't feel\r\nthat I am in a position to render a judgment as to his character or his\r\nimpulsiveness, the degree of impulsiveness, whether he was capable----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Whether he was prone to violent action.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I just don't feel really competent. I have no doubt that\r\na conclusion can be drawn from reports; of course, that was one of the\r\nbasic issues at the trial.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any evidence that the FBI found to the\r\neffect that Ruby was a Communist?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any evidence found by the FBI to the\r\neffect that Ruby was connected with in any way whatsoever so-called\r\nrightist groups?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; I do not recall anything of that nature.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No association that you know of as a result of the\r\ninvestigation of Ruby with any foreign government or agency of a\r\nforeign government?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; you understand, you are asking me questions, and\r\nI am replying on the basis of my best recollection, but I am giving you\r\nan answer from my knowledge of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is what we were seeking, no more than that, because\r\nyour impressions would be valuable.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. The reason I say that there may be someone we interviewed\r\nwho made a statement about Ruby and it was run out, and it was found to\r\nbe false. Congressman Ford, you asked me if he was a Communist. I would\r\nsay we have no evidence of that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you feel that in view of the evidence that Oswald was\r\na defector, that he engaged in this Fair Play for Cuba business, that\r\nhe lied in his communications with the FBI, that Mr. Hosty should have\r\nbeen alerted by locating Oswald in the School Book Depository early\r\nin November, that he should have been alerted to informing the Secret\r\nService of that?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; I do not. You must take this matter in its proper\r\ncontext. I pointed out to you previously that this man came back from\r\nRussia; he indicated that he had learned his lesson, was disenchanted\r\nwith Russia, and had a renewed concept--I am paraphrasing, a renewed\r\nconcept--of the American free society.\r\n\r\nWe talked to him twice. He likewise indicated he was disenchanted with\r\nRussia. We satisfied ourselves that we had met our requirement, namely\r\nto find out whether he had been recruited by Soviet intelligence. The\r\ncase was closed.\r\n\r\nWe again exhibited interest on the basis of these contacts with\r\nThe Worker, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which are relatively\r\ninconsequential.\r\n\r\nHis activities for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans, we\r\nknew, were not of real consequence as he was not connected with any\r\norganized activity there.\r\n\r\nThe interview with him in jail is not significant from the standpoint\r\nof whether he had a propensity for violence.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is the Quigley interview you are talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes; it was a self-serving interview.\r\n\r\nThe visits with the Soviet Embassy were evidently for the purpose of\r\nsecuring a visa, and he had told us during one of the interviews that\r\nhe would probably take his wife back to Soviet Russia some time in the\r\nfuture. He had come back to Dallas. Hosty had established that he had\r\na job, he was working, and had told Mrs. Paine that when he got the\r\nmoney he was going to take an apartment when the baby was old enough,\r\nhe was going to take an apartment, and the family would live together.\r\n\r\nHe gave evidence of settling down. Nowhere during the course of this\r\ninvestigation or the information that came to us from other agencies\r\nwas there any indication of a potential for violence on his part.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there was no basis for Hosty to go to Secret Service and\r\nadvise them of Oswald's presence. Hosty was alert, as was the Dallas\r\noffice, to furnish information to Secret Service on the occasion of the\r\nPresident's visit.\r\n\r\nIt is my recollection that Hosty actually participated in delivering\r\nsome material to Secret Service himself, and helped prepare a\r\nmemorandum on another matter that was sent over there. So that most\r\ncertainly the office was alert. The agent in charge had alerted his\r\nagents, even on the morning of the visit, as he had previously done a\r\nweek or 10 days before the visit.\r\n\r\nSo that, in answer to your question, I cannot even through the process\r\nof going back and seeking to apply this against what happened,\r\njustifiably say that Hosty should have given this information under the\r\nexisting conditions and with the history of this matter, that he was in\r\na position to give it to the Secret Service. Now, most certainly----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We wish he had.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Of course.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, I have a call from the floor of the\r\nHouse. I wonder if I could ask Mr. Belmont a question.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In response to a question by Mr. McCloy, you\r\ncategorically said that Federal Bureau of Investigation under no\r\ncircumstances had employed Oswald as an informant, as an agent or in\r\nany other way whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You would be in a position to know specifically\r\nthat information?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You also said, as I recall, that you had found no\r\ncredible information or evidence thus far that Oswald was connected in\r\nany way whatsoever with another country as an agent. Is that about what\r\nyou said or do you wish to reaffirm it in another way?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I will affirm what you said.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is a difference, however, between your\r\nknowledge as to whether the FBI had hired Oswald, you can be very\r\ncategorical about that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You can only----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Say based on the evidence that we have or which developed\r\nor all information that we received, there was no indication that\r\nOswald was in any way connected or within the service of a foreign\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there is a difference in the way you can\r\nanswer those two questions.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There is a difference, yes; there is a difference\r\nbecause in the one case we know, in the other case we rely on all the\r\ninformation and evidence available.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But as far as a foreign government is concerned,\r\nyou only know what you have been able to find out?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is always the possibility in the second\r\ncase, involving a foreign government, that something might come up at\r\nsome other time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. There is always the possibility. We have no indication of\r\nit. There is always the possibility; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you cannot be as categorical about the future\r\nin the second case as you were in the first case.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir; you are right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are there any other questions?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you have some more?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think I have got all the questions I wanted to ask.\r\n\r\n(At this point in the proceedings, Representative Ford leaves the\r\nhearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have two or three questions.\r\n\r\nAs you know, Mr. Belmont, there have been a wide variety of rumors\r\nthat have been spread abroad very particularly with regard to the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nI have before me, just received last night, a book just being published\r\nin England, it is coming out in the next day or 2, called \"Who Killed\r\nKennedy,\" by Thomas G. Buchanan, published in London by Secker and\r\nWarburg. I have not had an opportunity yet to read the book. I have\r\nread a good deal of the background material on which it is based.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask though when this book is available to you, and we\r\nwill make a copy available to you and see that you get one promptly,\r\nwhether you would have the Bureau read this, an appropriate person in\r\nthe Bureau familiar with the case or yourself, and possibly give us\r\nyour views with regard to certain of the allegations here within your\r\nparticular competence.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. As I understand it, Mr. Dulles, this is probably a\r\ncompilation of the articles that he wrote in the French press.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Express; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Which, I believe, we sent over to the Commission as we\r\nreceived them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. And from my recollection of perusing those articles, they\r\nare filled with false statements, innuendoes, incorrect conclusions,\r\nmisinformation, and certainly what I would term false journalism. In\r\nother words, he has stated as fact or as a correct conclusion many\r\nthings which the Commission's investigation has disproved completely.\r\n\r\nWe will be glad to read the book and to furnish you with a general\r\ncomment on it. But to take down each statement in there and go into it\r\nwould probably result in a critique of 500 pages.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We do not want that. I don't think we need that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Where actually many of these allegations have already been\r\nresolved by the Commission, I am sure. We will be glad to read it and\r\ngive you a----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think that would be useful for the Commission to have,\r\nMr. Chairman. Do you agree?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well; yes. If you find any factual matters in there\r\nthat contradict your findings, we would expect you to call it to our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Most certainly, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But otherwise I don't think we want a review of the book.\r\nThat is your idea, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Not a review of the book, but if there are allegations\r\nthere, any evidence you can factually deny, that would be helpful to\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you have any record of Buchanan? Do you know anything\r\nabout Buchanan's background?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; I do not recall.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wish you would check.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. We can send you a letter.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We have the record.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. He seems to be very much Ivy League, Lawrenceville School\r\nand Yale.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He was at one time, I believe, he admitted to being a\r\nCommunist at one time. He was at one time employed by the Washington\r\nStar, I am advised, and I believe, according to the information I have,\r\nthat he was terminated by the Star some years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I thought he had been in touch with the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. He came in, he did come in here, and made a statement\r\nwhich we have recorded. His testimony wasn't taken. He just walked in\r\noff the street.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have one or two more questions, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nI believe, Mr. Belmont, that you probably have furnished us already\r\nwith information with regard to any contacts that Oswald might have\r\nhad, individuals whom he knew, persons who might have been accused of\r\nbeing accomplices of his, but if there is anybody there or any persons\r\nin your file whom Oswald knew who have not been communicated to us, we\r\nwould certainly like to have them to be sure we have looked into that\r\nfield exhaustively, anybody who, according to your records, Oswald knew.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. I am sure we have explored that fully, and we have\r\nreported it to the Commission fully.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All right; good.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In view of your deep study of the case, have you reached\r\nany views of your own or are there any views of the Bureau, as to\r\nOswald's motivation in the act that he committed?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Again I don't feel competent to give you an answer. There\r\nis an indication from the exploration of his background that he wanted\r\nto be somebody. He wanted to be known as someone. Whether this caused\r\nhim to do this terrible thing I don't know. I think if it were possible\r\nto peer into Oswald's mind, that would really be the only way you could\r\nget your question answered.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you and the Bureau made any comparative study of the\r\nvarious assassination attempts and assassinations of other Presidents\r\nand people in high authority in this Government to see whether any\r\npattern at all runs through these various attempts other than attempts\r\nwhere there is clearly a plot, as in the case of the attack on\r\nPresident Truman, and probably also in the case of President Lincoln? I\r\nam thinking chiefly of the assassination of President McKinley and the\r\nattempted assassination of President-elect Roosevelt in 1933.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; we have not made a study of that nature. I would\r\nimagine that Secret Service has made a study.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They have made a study. I didn't know whether you had made\r\none also.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; we have not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Belmont, I have here in my hand a sheet that appeared\r\non the newsstands over the weekend. It is supposed to be the National\r\nEnquirer. I believe it is out of New York, and it contains a page and\r\na third about the assassination of the President and certain actions\r\nof the FBI, and so forth, and for the record I should like to read a\r\nportion of it and merely ask you if, in your opinion----\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And with your knowledge there is any truth to any part of\r\nit. You, of course, are acquainted with that paper.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. No, sir; I am not. In fact, someone told me it was, it\r\ncame from, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and I was shocked that something\r\nlike that would be in that paper. I found it was not the Philadelphia\r\nInquirer.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think, in view of the relationship you have had in this\r\nwhole matter, I would like to have your testimony in the record on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Very good, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. There is no date on this paper, and I am told it appeared\r\nin three different days in three different formats with different\r\nheadlines, but the same item. It is said to be by John Henshaw,\r\nEnquirer Washington Bureau Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Washington--The hottest story making the rounds here is that the U.S.\r\nJustice Department prevented the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack\r\nRuby BEFORE the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Oswald and\r\nthe man who killed him, Ruby, were suspected of being partners in crime\r\n7 months before the President's death.\r\n\r\n\"The incredible details of the story are so explosive that officials\r\nwon't even answer 'no comment' when queried about it. But the story\r\nbeing discussed by top-level Government officials reveals:\r\n\r\n\"1. That the Justice Department deliberately kept Oswald and Ruby out\r\nof jail before the assassination.\r\n\r\n\"2. That Dallas cops suspected Oswald of being the gunman and Ruby\r\nthe paymaster in a plot to murder former Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker--7\r\nmonths before the President was assassinated.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was using Ruby to recruit\r\ncommandoes for raids against Castro's Cuba. To prevent this explosive\r\ninformation from being disclosed, the CIA asked the Justice Department\r\nto step in and stop the Dallas police from arresting Jack Ruby, as well\r\nas Oswald.\r\n\r\n\"A top-secret document--a letter signed by a high official of the\r\nJustice Department--was sent in April 1963 from the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment to Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry requesting the\r\nDallas police NOT to arrest Oswald and Ruby in connection with the\r\nattempted slaying of General Walker.\r\n\r\n\"After a sniper shot at, but missed, General Walker in Dallas, April\r\n10, 1963, Dallas police suspected that Oswald was the sniper and Ruby\r\nthe payoff man.\r\n\r\n\"The cops were set to arrest the pair. But they never got the\r\nchance because of the heavy pressure brought to bear by the Justice\r\nDepartment. And so Oswald and Ruby were allowed to remain free. And 7\r\nmonths later, on last November 22 in Dallas, Oswald was able to kill\r\nthe President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The top-secret document--a copy of it is reportedly in the hands of\r\nthe Presidential Commission investigating the assassination--bares a\r\nweb of intrigue that involves the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\r\nalong with the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\n\"It is so politically explosive that the Presidential Commission,\r\nheaded by Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, has even withheld it\r\nfrom one of its own members, Senator Richard Russell (D., Ga.).\r\n\r\n\"It is feared that Senator Russell, who leads the South in the fight\r\nagainst the civil rights bill, might use the document as a weapon\r\nagainst the Justice Department and its chief, Attorney General Robert\r\nKennedy, a leader in the fight for civil rights.\r\n\r\n\"The document--requesting the cops not to arrest Ruby and\r\nOswald--contradicts the FBI report on the assassination and the\r\nsubsequent murder of Oswald.\"\r\n\r\nMy question is, do you have any information that would lead you to\r\nbelieve that any of those allegations are true?\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. My answer, sir, is that that is utter fantastic nonsense,\r\nand I have no information to indicate that any of the allegations are\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think we had better mark this and introduce it in\r\nevidence. There is much more to the article, but it is explanatory of\r\nthis, but I thought that was sufficiently a direct allegation that we\r\nought to note it in the testimony. So will you give that a number, Mr.\r\nStern.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. It will be numbered 837.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. 837. It is introduced in evidence as No. 837.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. May we also have admitted, Mr. Chief Justice, Exhibit No.\r\n836, the letter of March 31, 1964, which Mr. Belmont has identified.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted under that number.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 836 and 837 and were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is there anything further, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I suggest that we get a copy of the paper which does\r\nhave the date on it. I forget what date it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELMONT. Mr. Rankin, I understand you have sent it over to us, so\r\nwe will be glad to answer your letter.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Mr. Belmont, we appreciate your cooperation, and we\r\nthank you for your courtesy.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:40 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, May 13, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LT. JACK REVILL\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on May 13, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Gerald\r\nR. Ford; and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Arlen Specter, assistant counsel; and Charles\r\nMurray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant Revill, the purpose of today's hearing is to\r\nhear your testimony and that of Detective V. J. Brian with particular\r\nregard to alleged conversation with Special Agent James P. Hosty, Jr.,\r\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claimed to have occurred on\r\nNovember 22, 1963, in the afternoon, and also concerning the facts\r\nsurrounding the discussion of Commission Exhibits 710 and 711.\r\n\r\nWhat are those--those are the affidavits?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is his affidavit and Detective Brian's.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Those are the affidavits that you made in that regard.\r\n\r\nWould you please rise and raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthis Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth so help you God?\r\n\r\nLieutenant REVILL. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rankin will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Lieutenant Revill, will you state your name and place of\r\nresidence for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. My name is Jack Revill. I reside at 5617 Madowics, Dallas,\r\nTex.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have an official connection with the police\r\ndepartment of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I am presently a lieutenant of police of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you occupied that position?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I was promoted to lieutenant June 26, 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any particular area of responsibility?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I am presently in charge of the criminal\r\nintelligence section.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you been in charge of that section since November 22\r\nof 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What are the functions of your work in that job?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. My unit--our primary responsibility is to investigate\r\ncrimes of an organized nature, subversive activities, racial matters,\r\nlabor racketeering, and to do anything that the chief might desire. We\r\nwork for the chief of police. I report to a captain who is in charge of\r\nthe special service bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who is that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Capt. Pat Gannaway.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you reported to him?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. In my present capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Since I have been assigned to the criminal intelligence\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So that was for all times since and on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; this is true.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know James P. Hosty, Jr.?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you known him?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I have known Jim, Mr. Hosty, since 1959, when I took over\r\nthe intelligence section.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you see him on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. In the basement of the city hall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Just before you saw Special Agent Hosty, where had you been?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I had been at the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. We conducted a systematic search of the building, evacuated\r\nthe people working in the building, and took names, addresses, and\r\nphone numbers of all of these people before they were permitted to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was anyone working with you there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Numerous people.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see. Was Detective Brian with you there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir. I had taken Detective Brian with me from the\r\nTrade Mart, Dallas Trade Mart, upon hearing of the shots being fired at\r\nMr. Kennedy. I took Detective Brian and two other officers assigned to\r\nmy unit, Detective R. W. Westphal and Detective Tarver, O. J. Tarver.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you come back to the police department?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. By automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By car?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was anyone with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir, I had Detectives Brian, Tarver, and Westphal.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. They were all in the car with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And which way did you enter the building?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The Main Street ramp into the basement of the city hall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time of the day?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. It must have been about 2:45, 2:50.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All of these officers were with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did you see Special Agent Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. If I might explain that, I followed Mr. Hosty into the\r\nbasement of the city hall. He drove into the basement, parked his car,\r\nI did the same, and Mr. Hosty departed from his car, ran over to where\r\nI was standing, Detective Brian and I.\r\n\r\nThe other two officers, Westphal and Tarver, as well as I recall, had\r\nremained in the rear talking to some other officers. I don't know who\r\nthey were. At that time everything was mass confusion, and we were all\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you explain to the Commission where you parked the car\r\nwith reference to the point where you saw Agent Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I got out of my car, and we have two attendants assigned to\r\nthe basement, two Negro attendants, and one of these individuals parked\r\nmy vehicle for me, I don't know where he parked it. But as I got out of\r\nthe car, Mr. Hosty ran toward me----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, about the parking, excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that a part of the basement area of the police\r\ndepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All right; proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. And Mr. Hosty ran over to me and he says, \"Jack\"--now as I\r\nrecall these words--\"a Communist killed President Kennedy.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"What?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Lee Oswald killed President Kennedy.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Who is Lee Oswald?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"He is in our Communist file. We knew he was here in Dallas.\"\r\nAt that time Hosty and I started walking off, and Brian, as well as\r\nI recall, sort of stayed back, and as we got onto the elevator or\r\njust prior to getting on the elevator Mr. Hosty related that they had\r\ninformation that this man was capable of this, and at this I blew up at\r\nhim, and I said, \"Jim\"----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say in regard to his being capable?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This was it. They had--\"We had information that this man\r\nwas capable\"----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Of what?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Of committing this assassination. This is what I understood\r\nhim to say.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are those his exact words?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. As well as I recall. Give him the benefit of the doubt; I\r\nmight have misunderstood him. But I don't believe I did, because the\r\npart about him being in Dallas, and the fact that he was a suspected\r\nCommunist, I understand by the rules of the Attorney General they\r\ncannot tell us this, but the information about him being capable,\r\nI felt that we had taken a part in the security measures for Mr.\r\nKennedy, and if such, if such information was available to another law\r\nenforcement agency, I felt they should have made it known to all of us,\r\nand I asked Hosty where he was going at that time. By this time we were\r\non the elevator and he said he was going up to homicide and robbery to\r\ntell Captain Fritz the same thing. I said, \"Do you know Captain Fritz?\"\r\nand he said he had never met him. I said, \"All right, I will take you\r\nup and introduce you to Captain Fritz.\" So Detective Brian and I and\r\nHosty went to the third floor of the city hall and went to Captain\r\nFritz' office, the homicide and robbery bureau. We didn't see Captain\r\nFritz, he may or may not have been there. His office door was closed.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What time of the day, could you give me the approximate\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Between 2:30 and 3 o'clock, and I have the reason for\r\nsaying this because of the typing of this report here. Our secretary\r\ngot off at 4 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And Chief Curry had not yet returned, had he?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't know where he was.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't know about that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything about this to Captain Fritz?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I did not talk to Captain Fritz, as I said, I didn't see\r\nhim. I introduced Mr. Hosty to Lieutenant Ted Wells, who is one of\r\nthe lieutenants assigned to the homicide and robbery bureau and also\r\npresent at that time was another special agent, Mr. Bookhout, and\r\nHosty, there was confusion within this office, so Brian and I, after\r\nintroducing Mr. Hosty to Wells, left and went back to the special\r\nservice bureau office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you didn't say anything to the inspector about it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The inspector?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Lieutenant Wells.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't tell him this important information?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Hosty was going up to tell him the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And Hosty told you then that he was going up to tell him\r\nthat they knew he was capable of being the assassin?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; being at that time I was out of touch with\r\neverything, being in the building, I had put no connection between the\r\nshooting of Tippit and the President.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know that Oswald had been arrested?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; at that time I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You just knew about the someone by the name of Lee, didn't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; Lee. And this was told to me by a colored\r\nemployee of the School Book Depository. Myself and Lieutenant Frank\r\nDyson took charge of the search of the building and we must have had\r\n75 or 80 men in the building assisting in this search. I talked to a\r\nNegro----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were you in charge of that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I was in charge of that phase of the search.\r\nI talked to a Negro by the name of Givens, and we had handled this\r\nperson in the past for marijuana violations and I recognized him and in\r\ntalking to him I asked him if he had been on the sixth floor, and as\r\nwell as I recall, and Detective Brian was present at this same time he\r\nsaid, yes, that he had observed Mr. Lee, over by this window. Well,\r\nI asked him who Mr. Lee was, he said, \"It is a white boy.\" He didn't\r\nknow his full name. So, I turned this Givens individual over to one\r\nof our Negro detectives and told him to take him to Captain Fritz for\r\ninterrogation, and while going to the city hall, or the police station\r\nI passed this detective and Givens, and they came into the homicide\r\nand robbery bureau shortly after Hosty and I did, so I am sure Captain\r\nFritz did talk to Mr. Givens.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When did you learn that Oswald had been arrested?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I really don't know, sir. Because time, we were all shocked\r\nthat this thing had happened in our city and I personally felt that\r\nmaybe a sense of responsibility, maybe we could have done more to\r\nprevent this thing. I just don't know when I heard that he had been\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know it by the time you went to Lieutenant Wells'\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not. He may have been in the office at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't know that Oswald was already in the police\r\ndepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not. I had been in this building since word\r\ncame of the shots being fired until about 2:30, 2:35, and at that time\r\nI decided that my unit could possibly do more at our office where we\r\nkept all of our files, cataloging these people, the suspects that were\r\nrunning through my mind at that time. So, I was, I put out a call for\r\nall of the intelligence unit personnel to meet me at the office and I\r\ngot no reply to this because they were all up in the special service\r\nbureau. We had been assigned to the Trade Mart, and two or three of my\r\nofficers had taken into custody four or five of these picket carriers,\r\nand we did this more for protection than anything else because after\r\nthe word came of the assassination, well, I am afraid they would have\r\nbeen mobbed, and they were all up in the special service bureau booking\r\nthese prisoners at the time, and I decided we would stop by the special\r\nservice bureau office, to report back to my captain and see if there\r\nwas something we could do there. And as I pulled into the basement this\r\nconversation took place with Mr. Hosty.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the particular words about Oswald being capable of\r\nbeing an assassin those were told you by Agent Hosty in the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; either just outside the elevator and as we got on.\r\nHe never mentioned this again because I guess I lost my temper at him\r\nfor withholding this type of information.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see. Did you do anything about losing your temper, did\r\nyou say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No; Jim Hosty and I are friends, and this has hurt me that\r\nI have involved Hosty into this thing, because he is a good agent, he\r\nis one of the agents there that we can work with; that has been most\r\ncooperative in the past, and I worked with him just like he is one of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You went to the third floor on the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who else went with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Detective Brian and Hosty, the elevator was--had several\r\npeople on it. I don't recall who they were.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was Detective Brian on that elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At that same time?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. He went to the third floor with me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are sure Agent Hosty was on the elevator with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are sure you were on the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you tell us exactly what you said to Hosty and\r\nalso what he said to you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. After hearing about the information that they were\r\npurported to have had----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you told us all the information that Hosty told you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. As well as I recall; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, did you say anything to him about it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I asked him why he had not told us this, and the best, my\r\nrecollection is that he said he couldn't. Now, what he meant by that I\r\ndon't know. Because in the past our relations had been such that this\r\ntype of information, it surprised me they had not, if they had such\r\ninformation he had not brought it or hadn't made it available to us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are certain you went up there on the elevator\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; took him to the third floor and introduced him to\r\nLieutenant Wells.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you sure you didn't go up the stairs together.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; we went to the third floor on the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You are positive?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; because we caught the elevator in the basement,\r\nand there would have been no reason to walk up the stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If Agent Hosty said you went up the stairs rapidly\r\ntogether, that would be untrue?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; this would be untrue.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you go in that same driveway that the car went in that\r\nwas to take Oswald out?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That driveway; and you took that elevator right to the left\r\nas you went in there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; we go straight into the doors into the elevator\r\nthat goes up to the third floor.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Third and fourth floor.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question to reconstruct this a bit?\r\nBoth Detective Brian and yourself came in one car?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you had two other officers with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. More or less the same time Mr. Hosty came in?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. We followed Mr. Hosty into the basement.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Each in a car?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he was in a car and we were in mine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your first contact with Mr. Hosty was in the\r\nbasement there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did he say there?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. He come running up to me, and he said, \"Jack, a Communist\r\nkilled President Kennedy.\" I said, \"What? What are you talking about?\"\r\nHe said, \"Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy,\" and at that I\r\nsaid \"Who is Lee Harvey Oswald?\" And then he told me about him having\r\nhim in their security files, and then that, \"We had information that he\r\nwas capable of this.\" By \"we\" I assumed he meant the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Then Brian, Hosty, and yourself walked to the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the three of you took the elevator up to the\r\nthird floor?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is about 10 feet as I remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; it is more than that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is a different elevator. It is not the one that take\r\nprisoners down?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; it is the swinging doors, you go through the\r\nswinging doors.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is another elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At what point in the sequence did you blow up, as\r\nyou say?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. When he told me about the capability. By blowing up----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that standing in the basement near the car or\r\nwas it over toward the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. We were walking over toward the elevator during this\r\nconversation and as far as blowing up, this is semantics. I wanted to\r\nknow why they had not given us this information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is his reaction to that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. \"We couldn't.\" I do not know what he meant by that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you use words like \"We couldn't\" that \"Oswald\r\nwas a Communist\" this is what I am trying to find out. You mean these\r\nare the precise words he said or are these your interpretations of what\r\nhe said?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The time involved it could be my interpretation, to give\r\nhim the benefit of the doubt, because as I said Hosty is a friend of\r\nmine, and the last thing I wanted to do was to cause this man any\r\ntrouble, because of our relations in the past.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you ever had any doubt in the interval\r\nbetween that time and now that what your recollection is is accurate or\r\ninaccurate, fair or unfair?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. As far as I am concerned I have; this report is honest,\r\nand it was made within an hour after he made the thing. And since this\r\nassassination I have gone over in my mind could I have misunderstood\r\nhim. I sometimes wish or hoped that I have. But this is in essence what\r\nhe said to me. It might not be exactly the \"we's\" the \"I's\" but in\r\nessence it is what Mr. Hosty said.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At one point as I recall your testimony, you\r\nsaid Hosty said that Oswald was a Communist. A few minutes after that\r\ntestimony I think you said that Hosty suspected he was a Communist.\r\nNow, did you say that deliberately or did you just----\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; if I said that I was wrong.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that just confusion?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. As I mentioned earlier he come hurrying up to me and he\r\nsaid, \"Jack, a Communist killed the President.\" I said, \"What?\" He\r\nsaid, \"Lee Harvey Oswald, a Communist killed the President,\" and then\r\nhe went into the fact that they had known he was there, and then at\r\nthe conclusion of our, not the conclusion because we continued to\r\ndiscuss this thing going up on the elevator, he made the statement that\r\nthey had information that he was capable of this. He might have said\r\nprobably or possibly capable of it, I don't recall, because in Dallas\r\nthat day, the town died, and I know I was sick that this thing happened\r\nin my city, and I felt that maybe we could have done something else to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You stress the word \"capable\", that sticks in your mind,\r\ndoes it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He didn't say might have done it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; capable.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Normally would information of this kind have passed to you\r\ndirectly from the FBI or through the Secret Service in the event--of\r\ncourse, there hadn't been other Presidential visits, I guess, so there\r\nwas no precedent but I was wondering in the case of a Presidential\r\nvisit would it normally have come to you directly from the Secret\r\nService rather than directly from the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Well, in the past Mr. Kennedy had visited Mr. Rayburn\r\nthere and this information had never been made known to us and usually\r\nthe information we got from the FBI and you have got to realize the\r\nrelations are good, was on a personal basis, working with Mr. Hosty and\r\nthe other agent assigned to their security section and men assigned to\r\ntheir criminal section, it was a share and share alike thing because\r\nI have 11 men, and we just augmented their force really with the\r\ninformation we gathered.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had you had a meeting with the FBI, a general meeting, to\r\ngo over security problems prior to this time, prior to the President's\r\nvisit?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I personally had taken part in no meetings.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. With the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. With the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Or Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Why was this?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This I do not know. This was handled at a higher level.\r\nIt is my understanding meetings were held and my captain who is my\r\nimmediate supervisor was involved in these meetings but----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were not present at these meetings?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I was not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But the meetings you think were held?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This is my understanding; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Lieutenant Revill, have you seen the original of that\r\nExhibit 709?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the report that you referred to when you were\r\nanswering questions?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I brought a copy.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; there was just one copy made of this and this is\r\nthe copy I retained. The original went to Chief Curry. And on this,\r\nChief Curry called me and he would like me to swear that this was a\r\ntrue and correct statement, and this I did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By that you are referring to the statement sworn to and\r\nsubscribed before me this 7th day of April 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you tell us how you happened to make this report,\r\nExhibit 709?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Why I made the report?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did it happen that you made it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. After Mr. Hosty had related these circumstances to me, and\r\nafter taking him to the third floor, I reported this incident to my\r\ncaptain, Captain Gannaway.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was this?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Within minutes after I left Mr. Hosty at the homicide and\r\nrobbery bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to him?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I told him what had happened, what had transpired.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Just describe what you said to him.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. About meeting Mr. Hosty in the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Just tell us what you said.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. About Mr. Hosty, following Mr. Hosty in the basement, that\r\nhe came up to me, and stated that a Communist had killed the President,\r\nand that a Lee Harvey Oswald, they had him in their security files, and\r\nthat they knew he was in Dallas, and that he was capable, that they had\r\ninformation he was capable of this. To this----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything about what you have said?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I don't recall. I might have.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You don't recall that at all?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did your captain ask you whether you said anything about\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't recall him asking me that; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything to you about it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he did. He told me to put this on paper.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all he said?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; and to which I told him that I hated to do that\r\nbecause of Mr. Hosty, that he might have been stating a personal\r\nopinion. He said, \"You put it on paper and give it to me and I will\r\ntake it to Chief Curry,\" and this I did.\r\n\r\nWithin 30 minutes to an hour after the thing happened.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Neither one of you said anything about this being strange\r\nthat Agent Hosty would say anything like this?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I do not recall, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't say anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't recall making such a statement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And he didn't say anything like that to you that you\r\nrecalled?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you write this out in longhand?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; and then I dictated it to one of the stenos in\r\nthe office. And she was to, this is what I mentioned earlier the time\r\nelement, she was to, she got off at 4 o'clock and this was before she\r\nwent home for the day.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is on November 22 you are talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you sign it on November 22 or at a later date?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The same time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But you swore to it on the 7th day of April 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You swore that was your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; at the time I was hoping it would never come up.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Because of the relations that we had with the Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You thought this was a bad thing for the Bureau?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. For them to admit to you that they knew----\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Not the admitting but to withhold it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. To withhold the information?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. They thought this man was capable of being an assassin?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And yet you say that Agent Hosty just blurted that out?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you told us all that you remember about it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; all that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you make this----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question that comes right along with that?\r\nDid he say anything to you about his having been in Russia and\r\nredefected?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That did not come up in this conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ask him how he knew he was a Communist?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Why not?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't know.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the statement that you gave on November 22\r\nwhich you have signed, you say?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. \"The subject was arrested for the murder of J.\r\nD. Tippit and is a prime suspect in the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This I found out after reporting to my office, I didn't\r\nknow what time this happened.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you learned this subsequent to\r\ngoing with Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And then coming back to your own office?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; some of the officers assigned to the Special\r\nService Bureau on--were involved in the arrest, Detectives Carroll and\r\nI talked to Agent Bob Barrett, I ran into him in the hall and he had\r\ntold me about the arrest of Oswald. I think he was present at the time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is how you learned about this?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At what time of day did you make this actual statement and\r\nsign it approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Approximately 3:30, 3:35.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 3:35 on the 22d of November?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is the actual statement that you then signed and then\r\nyou swore to it, and the notary's signature was put on on the 22d of\r\nApril?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; the notary's was on April 7, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 7th day of April, I mean, 7th day of April.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; but this is the report that I signed on the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is the actual report that you signed on the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. On the 22d. This is a copy, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; this is a copy I have in my hand.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The original of this was made on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And signed on November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And later sworn to on April 7?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; this is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. April 7, 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is all the information on 709 given by you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Is this 709?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. All of the information, what do you mean by this, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All of the language and everything on that exhibit, did you\r\ngive that to some stenographer to write?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I wrote it out. My stenographer, she is a clerk\r\ntypist, and--I roughed it out and then she typed it for me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, the words \"subject\" Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that given by you on the slip of paper you wrote out?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I wrote it out in longhand.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the words 605 Elsbeth Street, was that given by you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; this is the address we were given or I was given\r\nby some of the officers involved in the arrest.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who gave that to you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I believe Detective Carroll, Carroll or Detective Taylor,\r\nthey were both there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And was that at the time you made this out that you were\r\ngiven that information?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Shortly before I made this out.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't even know where he lived then?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not. I had never heard of him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know that is wrong, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The 605?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is it wrong?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As of the time.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. That is what they gave me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You found that out?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is an address he once lived at.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is correct. I want to find out what he knows about it.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Is this a--is this an incorrect address on Mr. Oswald where\r\nhe was living at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you check it up I think you will find--it is an\r\nincorrect address at the time. I think you will also find that 602\r\nElsbeth Street is where he lived at one time.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Now, where they got this address----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You never checked that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I personally have not checked it but I am sure it has been\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. But this is the address I was given.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, you say here that you were told that the subject was a\r\nmember of the Communist Party. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This might be my interpretation of Mr. Hosty saying a\r\nCommunist killed the President and we had him in our security files.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You are an expert in this field, aren't you? You are\r\nworking in the subversive field?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; but as far as an expert, I wouldn't say I am an\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know the difference between membership and a person\r\nbeing a Communist, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you know it is a very real difference?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; there is a difference.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know which Mr. Hosty told you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. He did not say that he was a member. This was my\r\nconnotation of what he said that a Communist, that \"We had him in our\r\nsecurity files.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question? Where did you get this address that\r\nyou put on of 605 Elsbeth Street, do you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; from Detective E. B. Carroll or Detective Taylor.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are they subordinates?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No; they are detectives assigned to the special service\r\nbureau. One of them works the narcotics squad and one of them is\r\nassigned to the vice unit.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You never ascertained where they got it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; this might be the address that they got from\r\nOswald, I do not know. I never even thought about it until you brought\r\nup the point that this is not the address.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can you find out where they got this address?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I can.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think that would be useful. I would like to know that. I\r\nwould like to know where they got this address also.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. It would have been the same day because this was made\r\nwithin an hour----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't put down on this statement anything about what\r\nyou said, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. All I was doing was reporting what Mr. Hosty said to me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the way you make all your reports just one side?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You never say what you said?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I do not put our opinions or our interpretation in\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You don't even say what you asked?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You just put the answer down?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Put what was given to me; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that is the way all the police department reports are\r\nmade?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I don't know whether this is the way they are all\r\nmade. This is the way we do it in our unit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After you made this report, do you know what happened to it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I gave it to the captain, my captain, Captain Gannaway.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether it was given to the Commission when the\r\npolice reports were furnished to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This I do not know, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will tell you that it was not given to the Commission. Do\r\nyou know any reason why it was withheld?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know any reason why it should have been withheld\r\nuntil Chief Curry came here?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with that being withheld?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I gave it to my superior, and what he did with it,\r\nI do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever have any discussions about withholding it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You did want to protect Agent Hosty, you say?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you hoped the information would not get out?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. By hoping----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. He didn't say exactly that, Mr. Rankin. He said he hoped\r\nhe wouldn't have to use it against Hosty as I understood him to say.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; my opinion, and this was my personal opinion that\r\nit would not serve any purpose. In your scope of the investigation,\r\nyes, I can see where it would, but I hated to get involved in a\r\ncontroversy with the FBI, because of our past relations.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you recently have a conversation with Lieutenant\r\nHopkins of Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Lieutenant Hopkins and I went to Sacramento, Calif., to a\r\nlaw enforcement intelligence unit conference and shared a room.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss this matter with him?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it broke in the papers while we were there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to him about it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. About the report? About this report?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I told him about the conversation with Mr. Hosty and\r\nabout according to the news release, the news stories, this thing\r\nwas released, and the newspaper reporters and television people in\r\nSacramento made it impossible for me to remain at the conference so I\r\nreturned to Dallas. I was there for 1 day and returned the next, the\r\nnext evening.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything about the report being inaccurate?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Inaccurate?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What was the date of this conference in Sacramento?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. April 22, 23, and 24, I believe. It was on a Thursday,\r\nFriday, and Saturday. It could have been the 23d, 24th, and 25th but I\r\nreturned on Friday evening.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you examine the newspaper report of your report,\r\nExhibit 709?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Did I examine it? Yes, sir; I read several newspaper\r\nreports of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you give the reports to the newspapers?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with giving it to the\r\nnewspapers?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; this would have been the last thing I would have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know who did?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I do not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted you to discuss this information with\r\nthe other officer from Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I started getting long-distance telephone calls on the\r\nevening, it must have been the 23d, it was Thursday night, I got two\r\nlong-distance phone calls, and Lieutenant Hopkins and I were sharing a\r\ndouble room and, of course----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant who?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Lieutenant Hopkins of the Fort Worth Police Department. H.\r\nF. Hopkins.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. And I discussed it with him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who was calling you long distance, what relevance\r\ndoes that have to it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. To my discussing it with him?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The long-distance phone calls were about this report, the\r\nAssociated Press and the United Press.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I see. They had heard about it, they called you\r\nlong distance and you discussed it with Hopkins who was in the room\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all that I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you anything further, or you?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Tippit was not under your jurisdiction, was he?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; he was not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant, I am not familiar with the newspaper report\r\nthat you are speaking of. What, in substance, did it say?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. There were several articles written. The Dallas papers\r\ncarried articles on it and the Sacramento, Calif., paper carried an\r\narticle on it. In essence it had to do with this conversation that\r\nHosty and I had and about this report and somewhere, someplace some\r\nnewspaper reporter must have seen a copy of this because he knew how\r\nmany paragraphs they had in it and he quoted, I believe, the last\r\nparagraph of the report verbatim, and this is what concerned me, that a\r\nreport such as this would fall into their hands.\r\n\r\nNow, who the reporter is, there were several reporters that were\r\ncurious about the thing, and I don't even recall which newspaper\r\ncarried the verbatim paragraph about Agent Hosty's conversation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And that is what caused you and Lieutenant Hopkins to\r\nhave a discussion?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did he bring the matter up to you or did you bring it up\r\nto him?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I might have brought it up to him because I was concerned\r\nthat this thing had been released.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What was your conversation concerning that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. That I had received these calls, the first one must have\r\nbeen around 2 o'clock in the morning, California time, from the\r\nAssociated Press. It was a lady writer, and she asked about this and\r\nI told her that any statement would have to be made by Chief Curry,\r\nand she trapped me really. She made a false statement that Hosty was\r\nsupposed to have said something else and I said no, that is not so. He\r\ndid not make a statement, and then there was my comment. From that it\r\nlooked like I had written them out a press release.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Looks like what?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. It appears as if I had written out a press release from the\r\ncomment in the newspapers but that was the only statement I made that\r\nHosty had not made such statement, it was a fabrication, he knew he was\r\ncapable, but he did not make such a statement. Hosty did not make such\r\na statement.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Then you discussed that with Mr. Hopkins?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you recall just what Mr. Hopkins asked you and what\r\nyou told him about this report?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Well, when I received the first call, I was in the coffee\r\nshop, it was 2 o'clock in the morning, we had been out with two of\r\nthe Sacramento County Sheriff's officers and I got the call and after\r\ngetting the call I went to the room and Hopkins had been awakened by\r\nthis phone call, and I told him about the call, and then from there on,\r\nI had numerous long-distance calls, and I answered the one with the\r\nUPI, and then I decided I would not talk to people. Because I couldn't\r\nsee where it would help anything.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did he ask you if the substance of this report was true,\r\nI am speaking now of Exhibit 709, the one we have been talking about.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Mr. Hopkins had never seen this report. I just told him\r\nwhat had transpired between Hosty and I and told him that a report had\r\nbeen made, and this is what they were calling on.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you at any time in talking to him repudiate anything\r\nthat was in this report?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir. The only thing I repudiated was the fact that this\r\nreporter had said that Hosty had made a statement and I said no, this\r\nis not true, about them not believing that he would do it, and I think\r\nI told Hopkins that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. Anything more?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant, thank you very much, sir, for your help here.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Thank you, sir. I am just sorry it happened.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You have told us what the truth of the situation is, you\r\ncould do no more and no less.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant, just a question or two, we forgot to ask, Mr.\r\nRankin, would you ask them, please?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said you made some handwritten notes about this 709\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you gave them to the typist--do you know what happened\r\nto those notes?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. They were destroyed, I am sure.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know what her name is who typed 709?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Mary Jane Robertson.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is she still with the police department?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What position is she in now?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. She is a clerk-typist in the special service bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know where the original of 709 is?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. With Chief Curry, I assume. Well, let's see. You have a\r\ncopy; I would assume he has got it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Wasn't a copy made at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I have it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The actual copy, you have?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it is in my little briefcase.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So that original would be available to us?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You have it here now?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I have a copy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A carbon copy?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. He showed us a copy of his testimony.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you know how many copies were made?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; one and one; an original and one.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you kept one copy and one went to Captain\r\nGannaway?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No; both copies went to Captain Gannaway who is my\r\nimmediate superior and he later gave me back the carbon and the\r\noriginal went to Chief Curry.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you have had the one copy in your possession\r\nsince how long?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Probably a week or two after this thing happened, and I\r\nhave had it in the Lee Harvey Oswald file.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You have had this copy in your files in the police\r\ndepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Since about December 1 or thereabouts?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you number those items in the file?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And the order in which they come in?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir. Now, this particular report was put in the Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald file, and he was given an intelligence number, A & T, if\r\nI may get this copy I will explain to you----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; would you do so, please?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Excuse me just a moment. You see, he was given A & T 2965,\r\npage 34, as it appears in his file. This is indexed with a card with\r\nthis file number and page number.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May I ask, would the next item in that file be numbered\r\n35?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it would.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And the one directly preceding it would be 33?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Thirty-three; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see, and you have the rest of your file which would\r\nindicate that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I don't have it with me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No; but you have it in your records.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And that could be produced if we wanted it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; it is the complete file we have now on Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. May we have----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I just see that?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could we make a copy of that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I put another piece in there because it is on\r\nonion skin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We could make a photostatic copy quickly and return this to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to number this in the next\r\norder of exhibits and offer it in evidence, if I may, this copy, the\r\nphotostatic copy.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just as a security matter, would you kindly look in the\r\nfile and see if by any chance your original longhand notes could have\r\nbeen put in the file, at this place in the file?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I can, but I am sure they were not, because this\r\nwas not made at my office. You see, we are removed physically from the\r\npolice department, the intelligence unit, and this was made at the\r\nspecial service bureau office.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see, not in your own office.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; we are an integral part of the special service\r\nbureau office but our files are maintained elsewhere, and this was made\r\nat the special service bureau office.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you sat down to write out this statement,\r\njust describe where you did it and how you did it, what kind of paper\r\nyou used and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Well, we use the white pads like this, and I wrote it out\r\non the pad, and in the special service bureau office and it was made in\r\nLieutenant Dyson's office, he was out, and I used his desk, and then I\r\ntook it to Mrs. Robertson, and she typed it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you consult with Detective Brian?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. During the time you were preparing it?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Or subsequent to its preparation?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I did not. At the time I couldn't have told you\r\nwho was with me or who overheard this thing because there was so much\r\nconfusion in the elevator and going to the elevator.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But Brian was with you on the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he was with me in the automobile and on the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he up in Gannaway's office with you, too?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; he works for me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He was with you at the time you went to Gannaway's\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The special service bureau office; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But he didn't see this at anytime?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; I say he didn't, I don't know whether he ever saw\r\nit or not. He might have seen it when I was working on it and I gave\r\nboth of the copies to the captain.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Lieutenant, did that entire Oswald file that you have\r\njust told us about come to the Commission, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't know. Now what we did, we made up several large\r\nbooks, and it is my understanding that a copy of one of these was given\r\nto the Attorney General Waggoner and he was in turn to furnish it to\r\nthis Commission, this I was told by Captain Gannaway.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was that?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. This was a month or two ago.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; but not when you first gave the files.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; because this happened on the same day.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Should that file have included this?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; it didn't. There were only two pieces made of it,\r\none copy and the original made of this.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see. What I am getting at, when the department sent\r\ntheir reports to us, did they send copies of this file that Exhibit 709\r\nis in?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. The Lee Harvey Oswald file?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't believe they did, because much of this is, pertains\r\nto newspaper articles, and information that we picked up such as leads\r\nwhere Ruby and Oswald were seen together, we ran all these things down,\r\nand then we would make a report of the lead, or the findings, and a\r\ncopy of it would go in their files.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. But this one here, was not placed in that book?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the original of Commission Exhibit No. 709 that you have\r\njust given us prior to the notary public's inscription, subscription to\r\nit, there is red ink underlining of Lee Harvey Oswald and James Hosty.\r\nWhen was that put on this copy?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I don't know, sir. Captain Gannaway must have done that\r\nbecause he had the thing and then later gave it to me. Now, the reason\r\nfor it being underlined, I don't know. On the original--yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would that be for filing purposes?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; I do. Normally we retain the original copy of\r\nevery report for our file copy, but I did not have the file copy or the\r\noriginal report so our clerk in indexing this underscored the name and\r\nthe address and she made cards for the index files.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was a card, also, under the file of James Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. His name is also underlined in red?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. His name indexed; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In your original copy of Exhibit 709?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. No, sir; not the original copy, because the original----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The carbon copy, excuse me, the carbon copy of 709.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And I assume that Commission's Exhibit No. 709 which is a\r\nphotostat is a photostat of the original rather than of the carbon copy?\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. Yes, sir; and I don't know who made the photostat, I did\r\nnot. I assume Chief Curry had it made.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Reporter, we are giving the number 838 to the carbon\r\ncopy of Exhibit 709 that Lieutenant Revill has just produced.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You propose to take a photostat of this and return this\r\nreport to the lieutenant?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If we may, Mr. Chief Justice, this is the only copy that I\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You should have it back.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. That is fine.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will take a photostat and return this to you then.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I appreciate that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted in that manner.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 838 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that is all. Thank you, again, lieutenant.\r\n\r\nMr. REVILL. I will attempt to find out on that address, and I shall let\r\nMr. Sorrels know, with Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; that will be fine.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF V. J. BRIAN\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Come right in, sir. Detective Brian, the purpose of\r\ntoday's hearing is to hear the testimony of Lieutenant Revill and\r\nyourself with particular regard to an alleged conversation with Special\r\nAgent James P. Hosty, Jr. of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nclaimed to have occurred on November 22, 1963, in the afternoon and\r\nalso concerning the facts surrounding the discussion of Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 709 and 711. 709 is the affidavit of Lieutenant Revill,\r\nand 711 is the affidavit that you made concerning that matter.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before this\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Please be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. My name is Brian.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. In Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have some connection with the police department in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I am a detective in the criminal intelligence\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you occupied that position?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Since June of 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What is your function as a detective for the criminal\r\nintelligence section?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. To gain, obtain information and keep records and files, and\r\nusually when an important Government official comes to town we guard\r\nthem or help assist guard them, and furnish information for other\r\nagencies outside of the Dallas Police Department and have liaison, and\r\ngeneral criminal investigation work.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with the Lee Harvey Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was the first time that you had anything to do with\r\nthat matter?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, we started interrogating people and talking to people\r\nimmediately after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time of the day?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. In the middle of the afternoon, probably----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir. The first thing that we done, I was, I personally\r\nthat day was, assigned at the Dallas Trade Mart where the President was\r\nto speak, I was on the side of the speaker stand when he was to come\r\nin, and they came in and got us and told us that he had been shot, and\r\nthe President of the United States had been shot, and that a man in the\r\nBook Depository down there and told us to go down there and see if we\r\ncould get him out, and four of us detectives down there got in a car\r\nand we went to the Book Depository and we arrived there a short time, I\r\ndon't know what time it was, a short time after the shooting occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who were the four you are describing now?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Lieutenant Revill, myself, a detective, O. J. Tarver, and a\r\ndetective, Roy W. Westphal.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We searched the Book Depository for a couple of hours. We\r\nspent about 2 hours, I would guess, approximately 2 hours down there\r\nsearching the Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you find anything at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir. I was there on the floor when the man found shells\r\nover in a corner when--where the assassin was hidden at. But other than\r\nthat, I wasn't present when anything was found.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you just describe that event when you saw those shells?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, a police sergeant, Jerry Hill, hollered, I was on the\r\nopposite side of the sixth floor, hollered that he had, this is where\r\nhe shot from, and shells were laying there, and I walked from where I\r\nwas at over to the other corner of the building and looked, and that\r\nis about the extent of my investigation there because they called the\r\ncrime laboratory and everybody else to get down there and they got an\r\nofficer to guard the place and not let nobody get around and we went on\r\nsearching the building.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you see, how many shells did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I am going to guess.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We don't want you to guess. If you can tell us your\r\nrecollection, that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, the first time I went over there, I believe I saw two,\r\nbut I am not sure, but I went back again later and there were three\r\nshells there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now after that, did you leave the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; after we spent considerable time, we went from the\r\ntop floor down to the bottom floor, back up, going through it, and we\r\nfinally wound up on the second floor taking all the acoustic tile out\r\nof the ceiling looking up to see if anybody was hidden up there, and I\r\nbelieve that was the last thing we did in the building. By that time,\r\nthere were a number of people in the building.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You were making a complete search of each floor, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I was with, I mean there were a number of officers\r\nthere. I didn't do it by myself, there were a number of us there and we\r\nwere searching it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then you left the building?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you leave with some other officers?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; Lieutenant Revill, myself, and Tarver and Westphal\r\nall went back to the car and left to go to city hall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then you got back to the city hall. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We drove into the basement and parked.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What time of the day was that, can you tell us?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Probably around 2 o'clock or somewhere in that. I don't\r\nreally know to be truthful because I didn't pay any attention to the\r\ntime but it was around 2 o'clock, I would guess.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the four of you were together at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What happened at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We got out of the car, and as we got out of the car----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was the car already inside the building or in the driveway\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nLet me explain. City hall basement, as some of you all know----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was just there so I want to know.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We came around the ramp and we parked in the basement. We\r\nwere parked in the basement, and we got out, and started around, there\r\nis a railing there, we started around the railing and at that time Jim\r\nHosty was coming across the basement, at a fast trot, or moving fairly\r\nfast----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Special Agent Hosty of the Bureau?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAnd he came across there and I know him, and I had known him for a good\r\nwhile to speak to him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where were you with reference to Lieutenant Revill at that\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I think I was on his, probably his right-hand side.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Close to him?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Fairly close; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAnd so we walked over to meet, kind of cornered, you cross paths and we\r\nwalked up there to meet Jim, and he said, he came up there and he said,\r\nthat Lee Oswald, a Communist, killed the President, and then Revill\r\nsaid, \"What?\" He said, Lee Oswald, a Communist, killed the President.\r\n\r\nHe was in--nervous--in a hurry, and was just talking.\r\n\r\nAnd then he said, he said that he knew that he was a Communist and he\r\nknew he worked in the Book Depository, and then Lieutenant Revill said\r\nsomething else to him, I am not--I don't know what he said, and they\r\nwalked off in front of me going in around and in through the door over\r\nto the elevator to go up, and then we accompanied Agent Hosty up to\r\nCaptain Fritz' office which is on the----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was the elevator there at the basement floor when you took\r\nit or did you have to wait?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We had to wait just a very short time on it. It wasn't\r\nstanding open waiting; no, sir.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait on it just a very short time, I believe, and we went up\r\nto the third floor, and Hosty and Lieutenant Revill went in there and\r\ntalked. I went to the door and just stepped inside and waited and then\r\nwe went back downstairs to our office which is on two, right underneath\r\nCaptain Fritz' office.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You accompanied them to the third floor and then you came\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. That I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or did you get out and come down the stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But you weren't with Lieutenant Revill any further?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. When we came back down to our office, we came back down, I\r\nam not sure whether we rode the elevator or not. It is a short trip\r\ndown and I am--I would be afraid to say whether we walked, rode, or\r\nhow we got down, but we went into Captain Gannaway's office and Revill\r\ntold, Lieutenant Revill told the Captain what Hosty had said, so he\r\nsaid, \"Write a report.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say at that time? What did he tell the Captain\r\nthat Agent Hosty had said?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. He told him, short and very quick, that they knew that\r\nOswald was a Communist and that he was in the Book Depository, and he\r\nsaid, \"Write a report and get it back to me right now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went right back and wrote a report.\r\n\r\nI forgot about the whole incident, I didn't think it would be important\r\nand I didn't--well, in fact, I didn't have time to because when I got\r\nback there they had a list of names they were going to start checking\r\nout and they handed me six of them and says, \"Start going and checking\r\nhere and here and here and checking these people.\"\r\n\r\nSo I never did dwell on it again.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In this conversation down in the basement, have you told us\r\nall that Agent Hosty said that you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And have you told us all that Lieutenant Revill said that\r\nyou recall?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you told us all that Lieutenant Revill told to Captain\r\nGannaway that you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, let's see. I believe that I have, yes, sir.\r\nWhen--Captain Gannaway's office, as you go in the door and turn right\r\nand his office is in there and if I recall correctly I didn't go all\r\nthe way in his office, he did and I stood in the door, and I really\r\ndidn't make a mental note of what happened and things were moving at a\r\nrather fast pace, and I believe that I did; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have made an affidavit about this, have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I made a report to Chief Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you swore to that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is Exhibit 711 a photostatic copy of your report that you\r\nmade that you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you swear to that report on the date that it bears?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. April 20, 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You read the Exhibit 711 right now, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is it correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are there any additions or corrections that you wish to\r\nmake to it?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I was just going to ask if you fixed the date on which he\r\ndictated that or wrote it, whichever he did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I haven't, but I will.\r\n\r\nWill you tell us on what date you wrote or dictated Exhibit 711?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; the day before, I believe it was the day before,\r\nChief Curry came up here. It was either a day or 2 days before April\r\n20th is what it says on there. That is the date that I made the report,\r\nthe day or 2 days before Chief Curry came up here.\r\n\r\nWill you tell us on what date you wrote or dictated Exhibit 711?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I didn't think--well, Captain Gannaway told Lieutenant\r\nRevill to write a report about the thing the date it happened, and he\r\ndid, or I assumed he did, and I guess that he did. I haven't----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you ever seen that report?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I have seen it, but I haven't read it. That is unusual but I\r\nhaven't. I didn't think the incident was really important, that is the\r\nreason why I didn't dwell on it, and I am sure it is now or I wouldn't\r\nbe up here.\r\n\r\nBut they, a few days before Chief Curry was to come up here they said\r\nthey wanted a report, you know, to what I had heard in the basement\r\nand this and that and the other, and I said, \"Well, I better write one\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\nI just assumed it was all taken care of, and so I wrote one on the\r\n20th, I wrote that report on the 20th and swore to it and turned it in\r\nand he brought it up here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You made no contemporaneous memoranda, that is on November\r\n22 you made no notes or memoranda of this?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So the report of April 20 you dictated on or about April 20\r\nis based on your memory?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Exhibit 711, your report, was that written out in longhand\r\nor dictated to a girl?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; I typed it myself on the typewriter. We don't have\r\na stenographer in our office to dictate to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You did type the part about the notary and so forth on the\r\nbottom?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know who did that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I believe Bill Biggio.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who is he?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. He is a detective who works the desk there, who is a notary\r\nwho notarized it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, before you made Exhibit 711 did anyone give you\r\nLieutenant Revill's report to examine?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Compare your report with?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you have never read that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't recall reading it; no, sir. I sure don't. I probably\r\nlooked at it but as far as sitting down and reading it, I have never\r\nread the report, I don't believe.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So if there is any differences between your report and his\r\nyou are not familiar with them?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Subsequent to November 22 and prior to April 20,\r\nwhen you prepared this Exhibit 711, did you ever talk to Lieutenant\r\nRevill about the incident?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I sure did. He couldn't remember who was with him\r\ndown in the basement, and it rocked on there and had rocked on there,\r\nand somewhere it came out that somebody said he was lying about it and\r\nhe was telling us, he said, \"I am telling you the truth\". \"You don't\r\nhave to tell me, I know you are; I was standing there with you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"You were the one who was with me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Yes, I was with you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I assumed he knew that I was with him. That is when he talked to\r\nChief Curry and Chief Curry come back and said he needed the report\r\nfrom me, too.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did this conversation take place?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. The date I don't have any idea. Probably 2 or 3 weeks, I\r\nwill tell you----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 2 or 3 weeks what? After November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; before the date I wrote the report, because I\r\nmessed around there for another couple of weeks and then I walked in\r\nthe office one day and he said, \"Chief Curry wants it today,\" and I\r\nsaid, \"All right, I will write it,\" and I sat down and wrote it, and\r\nI believe the next day or the day after that he brought it, came up\r\nhere, and all this come out in the paper about making a statement and\r\nme backing the statement up in Dallas, I don't know whether it came up\r\nhere or not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who prompted this conversation that you have been\r\ndescribing?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. In our office that day?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I am trying to think what brought it on. Somebody, there was\r\na statement in the paper or something that said that--anyway, somewhere\r\ndown the line it came out, it said it wasn't right what Lieutenant\r\nRevill had said.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I know it is right, I was standing there,\" and that was\r\nabout the extent of that.\r\n\r\nAnd then he said, \"Well, I will need\"--he talked to Chief Curry, I\r\nguess, and they decided they needed a report from me on it, and then\r\nI finally wrote the report and he brought it up here. I guess it was\r\njust in the course of a conversation more than anything. I don't think\r\nanybody prompted it, really.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In this Commission 711 you actually typed it out\r\nyourself?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are you a fairly accomplished typist?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir. I can type fairly well. I am not a touch typist. I\r\ncan't copy, but I can type fairly well typing something I don't have\r\nto copy off of a sheet of paper. In other words, I have to look at the\r\nkeys to type it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have to rewrite this a second time on the\r\ntypewriter?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir. I made several strikeovers and some other stuff,\r\nand typed it, I had to type it over again.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you typed it out once, and then\r\nretyped it yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I typed it twice. The first time everything wasn't\r\nright in there and the spelling and the strikeovers and stuff, and not\r\nbeing an accomplished typist I still don't like to throw things out,\r\nyou know, that don't look too bad so I typed it over again.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But after you typed it over the first time did you\r\nshow it to somebody else?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I believe Lieutenant Revill looked at it and called a bunch\r\nof mistakes to my attention.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What kind of mistakes?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, I don't know. There were some strikeovers and some, a\r\ncouple of misspelled words, I believe, and I don't have a copy of the\r\none that I copied from so I couldn't say, but I did have to type the\r\nreport over.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But these mistakes that were pointed out by\r\nLieutenant Revill, were they mistakes of substance or just mistakes\r\ninvolving spelling and the like?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, what do you mean by substance now?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, I mean as to the precise things that you\r\nsaid as to what transpired?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't believe there were. I am trying to recall what I had\r\nto add that took place there, and----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is important whether or not any statements of\r\nfacts were altered or whether the changes were simply typographical\r\nerrors or otherwise.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I will tell you one thing that I recall he called to my\r\nattention was 2:05 p.m., I believe, and I told him, I said I can't put\r\nthat in there because I don't know what time it was, and I don't. I\r\ndon't have any idea of what time it was, and he said, \"Well, all right,\r\nleave that out,\" but I think the substance was probably the same in\r\nboth reports. In fact, I am sure the substance was probably the same,\r\nbecause it was, the grammar was changed in some places, some spelling\r\nwas changed, and some strikeovers were changed, and I think probably\r\nthe second report was copied, that one was copied partially from the\r\nfirst one and then I made some changes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While you were in the process of discussing this\r\nwith Lieutenant Revill he didn't show you his report, Exhibit 709?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't know whether he did or not. I don't believe that he\r\ndid. I don't believe he did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Had you seen it before?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I have seen the report.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you see it before you typed this up?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't recall seeing it. I may have, but I don't recall it.\r\n\r\nNow, he has got something in there that I don't have in mine, I know\r\nabout him saying that Hosty knew that Oswald, I believe, was capable of\r\nassassinating the President, but I didn't hear Hosty say that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did you learn that that statement was in\r\nRevill's statement?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Just to be truthful, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did Lieutenant Revill ask you to include in your statement\r\nthat Hosty had said that Oswald was known to be capable of being an\r\nassassin?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; he asked me if I heard him say it and I told him\r\nno, but I don't believe he asked me to include that in the report.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You told him, no.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Probably the day--now, this all happened in the course of a\r\nweek's time and the conversations are hard to put on a day or time, I\r\nmean when you don't think--I didn't think all this was real important,\r\nand so I didn't try to backlog it to where--it was probably the day,\r\nprobably about April 20, along in there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Before or after you wrote your report?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. In between the first report and the second report I imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I am not quite clear about how you happened to make this\r\nreport in that I understood you to say that there were some newspaper\r\naccounts about it, and the lieutenant said, well, he had said what was\r\ntrue and something like that. Can you tell us what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, now, to go back. We were in the office talking and I\r\ndon't know how long this was because it may have been 2 days, 3 days,\r\n2 weeks or 3 weeks, before I wrote that report, we were sitting in the\r\noffice, and I don't recall whether it was a newspaper account or what\r\nit was, but anywhere somewhere down the line he got--somebody said that\r\nit wasn't the truth and he was lying or something and he was sitting\r\nout there talking and he said, he said he wasn't lying about it and I\r\ntold him, I said \"I know you are not lying because I stood there and\r\nheard you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Oh, you are the one who was with me?\" And I said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nBut I assumed that his report, up until that time I had not seen his\r\nreport, and I have seen it since then and I haven't read it from one\r\nend to the other until the other day, and he said, \"Well, I am glad\r\nto know you are the one who was there then,\" and evidently he had\r\nforgotten I was there, too.\r\n\r\nSo, he said, \"Well, make me a report on what you heard,\" and I said,\r\n\"All right, I will,\" and he talked to Chief Curry and evidently before\r\nhe told me that it was a matter of days or time differential in there\r\nand I said, \"All right,\" and I just did not get around to it until\r\nfinally one day I came in the office and he said, \"I've got to have\r\nthat report today,\" and I said, \"All right,\" and I sat down and wrote\r\nit and I had to write it over again, that happened on the day the\r\nreport is dated.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All of that happened, though, before any news accounts of\r\nit, didn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, I don't remember when they started putting it in the\r\nnewspapers. There had been something about it to make him, somewhere to\r\nmake him say, he was trying to convince me he was telling the truth and\r\nI said, \"Well, I know you are.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what brought it on, I don't know whether it was a\r\nnewspaper report or something, but anyway there was some--maybe\r\nChief Curry was on him about it, I don't know. But he said that he\r\nwas telling the truth and I told him I knew he was telling the truth\r\nbecause I had heard it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said you were there with him?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How close were you to him when he was talking to Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Right next to him when we were talking with him. We talked\r\naround there and how you meet, you know, you walk up together and meet\r\nand went on with him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were walking toward the elevator at that time, weren't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Let me draw you a little picture of how that is down there.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have been in the basement so I know something about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir. But the ramp goes up here, this is why it would be\r\neasier to draw a picture and it would be easier than I can explain. He\r\ncame down the ramp.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the car?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you parked in the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. And we parked the car, and Hosty had parked over here. You\r\nknow the ramp is wide here and the other side goes up here, he had\r\nparked over in here and he was coming across this way and we coming\r\nacross this way and we met.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is the elevator which takes prisoners up where Oswald\r\nwas shot?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Right through here, right in here somewhere is where Ruby\r\nshot Oswald and this is a ramp from the Main Street side and this is\r\nthe ramp to the Commerce side. And this is the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. The elevator is right there.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is the prisoners' elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Or the freight elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; that is the elevator going up----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Which one did you take?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We took the elevator inside the city hall basement.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there only one elevator there?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; there are two side by side. Back on this side of\r\nthe basement there are two elevators over here and one freight elevator\r\nright back on in here. But this is to the city hall this direction and\r\nthis is the ramp coming in from Main Street and the ramp going up to\r\nCommerce Street. We drove in this ramp one way going in this way and\r\none way going out.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where are the stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. In the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You don't know?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. There are no stairs in the basement. I mean out here where\r\nthe cars are parked. Right here is the ramp, there is a walkway going\r\nup but it is not a stairway and then it levels off and you go by\r\nthrough here, and the jail is right here, do you recall the jail being\r\nhere, on the right by the doors as you go in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I only saw the jail on top side.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Well, the jail office is right there at the head of this\r\nramp, the jail office where they book the prisoners through.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I didn't go in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. That is the door they brought Lee Oswald out of when he was\r\nshot, going into the jail office right there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There are no stairs from the basement to the third floor?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. There are stairs inside of the basement but there are none\r\nout here, inside of the basement of city hall but none out here in the\r\nparking area.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where are the stairs from the place where the elevators are\r\nthat you took. Are there any stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I didn't take any stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No. You say you took elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were there stairs near the elevators?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Back right over--let me get a pencil and draw the whole\r\nthing for you. That is about the way it is situated right there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Brian, we will call that Exhibit 839. Will you just\r\nbriefly tell the Commission what you have done in making that exhibit\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. All right, sir. I am not an artist. But we came down the\r\nramp on Main Street, came around here to the parking area. Mr. Hosty\r\nwas parked over here. There is a bunch of poles out there and I won't\r\ntry to draw them in here.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mark that \"A\" where Mr. Hosty was parked as you just\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. All right. And he was coming this way and we were coming\r\nthis way. We met him about in the middle of this ramp out here, and\r\ntalked, and----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You were right alongside of Lieutenant Revill?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; and they walked on off and I came back behind\r\nthrough here to these elevators and off here we caught the elevators\r\nand went on up.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How close were you when you came behind them?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Just--I didn't keep a constant pace with them, but as far\r\nas--I don't recall exactly----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You were close to them, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Here is the stairway in the basement, there is one narrow\r\nstairway going up to the first floor, and you pass it and you go by the\r\nphone booth and a jail office and you pass the stairway, it is right\r\nover here in the basement of city hall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you were close to them as you went across there to take\r\nthe elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I was behind them and they were going away from me and I was\r\nfairly close, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About how far?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Probably 6 or 7 feet or 8 feet behind. When we got to the\r\nelevator and we all stopped there together and caught the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where did the conversation take place, in front of the\r\nelevators there?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. That I heard?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Right out here, because Mr. Hosty started blurting it out\r\njust as soon as he started across here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you walked from this point here?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Over to here, to the elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mark that point \"B.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where you met?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where you met Hosty.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. OK.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you walked along, make a mark there, if you would,\r\nalong there to the elevators where you walked.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. That is not exactly that way, this is offset, you have to\r\ncome over here to go up, it is not drawn exactly right, we walked\r\nacross here to the elevators straight through.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How far is that, a hundred feet--no, less than that.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. It is much less than a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Fifty feet, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Probably 60, 70 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is this, where does that stairway go?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Up to the first floor. Back in the hallway.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you are quite clear you didn't go up that stairway?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. We didn't go up a stairway, no; not that stairway here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or any other stairway?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Going up?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; we didn't go up the stairway going up.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When you got up to the first floor by that stairway, are\r\nthere other stairs leading up to the floors above that connect with\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; you have to go around. This is just a narrow\r\nstairway going from the basement, it is probably, well, just a regular\r\nnarrow staircase that goes up, straight up. After you get to the first\r\nfloor the stairways widen out probably as wide as that window and go up\r\nhalf a floor and meet another landing and then go up to the third floor\r\nthat way. They widen out.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was anybody with Mr. Hosty?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Not when we met him there; no, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you got on the elevator, who was on the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. It was full.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were there a lot of pressmen down there, no television----\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't recall seeing any but there may have been some. I\r\ndon't recall seeing any but there may have been.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You say the elevator was full?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. About how many people would it carry approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Probably 10 or 12.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Revill and Hosty and yourself get on the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Anybody else get on at that point that you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. As I recall there was a little interchange of people, some\r\ngot off and some got on, I believe. I believe there was a little\r\ninterchange of people.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At the bottom, that is the bottom story for the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; in the basement.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you got on the elevator and as you rode up, did\r\nyou hear Hosty and Revill converse at all?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was no further conversation on this problem?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you got off the elevator where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Right on around. You get off the elevator and you come\r\nstraight out----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What floor--three?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Three. Went around to the left to Captain Fritz' office and\r\nturned right in Captain Fritz' office and I stopped right there at the\r\ndoor and he took him over and introduced him, talked to, I believe,\r\nLieutenant Wells.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Captain Fritz wasn't there at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't recall seeing him in there. But Captain Fritz has\r\ngot him a little office in the side and you have got to walk up in\r\nfront and see if he is in there because he stays in there all the time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did Revill and you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Went back down to our office.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Gannaway's--is that Gannaway's office?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Gannaway's; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you drove----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What floor is that on?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Captain Gannaway's is on the second floor.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you drove from the Texas School Depository\r\nBuilding after making a check of the facilities who was in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Our car?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Let me see, Lieutenant Revill, myself, Westphal, Tarver,\r\nand we gave a man a lift, and I don't remember whether he was a CID, I\r\ndon't know the man, I don't remember whether he was a CIC agent or a\r\nCID or OSI, he was some type of, as I recall, Army intelligence man.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Army, Air Force, or something?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. He was connected with the service and we let him out a\r\ncouple of blocks, if I recall, up about Field Street, somewhere along\r\nin there. Lieutenant Revill knew him, who he was, and he rode up there\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who drove the car?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Lieutenant Revill. It was his car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you sit in the front or back seat?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Sat in the back seat on the left-hand side.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who sat in the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were right behind Lieutenant Revill?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I believe I was right behind Lieutenant Revill. Yes, sir;\r\nthat is, I believe I sat in the back seat.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you got into the building and got out of the\r\ncar, what happened to the other occupants of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I don't know. They went on about, probably went up to\r\nCaptain Gannaway, but I don't recall seeing them after we started\r\ntalking to Hosty and went on, somewhere in the shuffle they didn't stay\r\nwith us and went on.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. They didn't accompany you up the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; and I don't know where they went.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is they weren't among the possibly 10 men of the\r\npolice who were in the elevator, as far as you remember, I mean?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. As far as I remember; no.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Brian, I call your attention to Exhibit 857A and the\r\nfact that is a newspaper account and ask you to examine and state\r\nwhether or not you recall having seen that before. I want to correct\r\nthe record, that is Commission 857A which is attached to Exhibit 831.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; I read this in the Dallas paper, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with giving that to the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you talk to any newspaper people about it?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; haven't talked to any since it happened.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All you know about it is that you just saw it in the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then----\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I know the next--it was supposed to come out on Friday\r\nbecause on Saturday they started calling my house and I left.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You never answered any of the calls?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; I never talked to any reporters about it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman, do you have anything?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I don't believe so, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Give me just 1 minute, Mr. Chief Justice. In the second\r\nparagraph of your letter, Commission Exhibit 711, you say \"Upon\r\nentering the basement of city hall,\" he, Agent Hosty, that you\r\nexplained, who had already parked his car, he also parked his car in\r\nthe basement of the city hall building?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; over here where you told me to put \"A\" he was or\r\nin that area over there and was out of his car walking towards us.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you go on to say \"and was walking very fast toward the\r\nentrance of the city hall from the parking area.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; that is this entrance over here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What is that marked? Is there a mark on that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir. You didn't tell me to mark \"A\" and \"B\" where we met.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You might mark that \"C,\" I think we have \"A\" and \"B.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. O.K., \"C\" would be the entrance by the jail office.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is right.\r\n\r\n\"At this time Hosty made the statement that Lee Oswald had killed the\r\nPresident, and that Oswald was a Communist.\"\r\n\r\nNow, at this time, that is walking toward point \"C\" you have just\r\nmarked on exhibit----\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; we stopped here for a pause just for a short time,\r\nit would be hard to say how long but it wasn't because--it wasn't long\r\nbecause it don't take long to make a statement.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is point \"B.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Near point \"B\" is where this conversation took place.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you did not hear the content of any further\r\nconversations?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. No, sir; other than that he said he knew he was a Communist\r\nand knew he was working in the Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did further conversations take place between Lieutenant\r\nRevill and Agent Hosty after that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; they walked on talking.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But you did not hear what they said at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. I was behind them and Lieutenant Revill got in a hurry when\r\nthat happened and they got on and I was behind them, and it is pretty\r\nhard to hear what people are saying in front of you when they have got\r\ntheir back turned to you and you are behind them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You have indicated that in paragraph 3 of Exhibit 7. You\r\nsay, \"While we were in the basement Hosty also said several things to\r\nLieutenant Revill that I could not hear,\" because of the excitement and\r\ncommotion, that is what you had reference to?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; they were conversing as they walked on and I\r\ncouldn't hear them and I didn't hear what they said, I was behind them.\r\nI didn't pay a whole lot of attention to the whole thing because like\r\nI say I didn't think it would matter any. It was just--and things were\r\nhappening pretty fast, and along about that time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer the diagram, Exhibit\r\n839, if I may.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, all right; it may be admitted under that number.\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 839 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the original before the notary public put his\r\nendorsement on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIAN. Yes, sir; that went forward.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Specter is going to examine these\r\npeople about the velocity and so forth and I want to speak on--speak to\r\nhim just a minute about the matter we talked about.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will take a break now.\r\n\r\n(Recess.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. FRAZIER\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Specter, you may proceed.\r\n\r\nYou have been sworn and you are still under oath, as you understand?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your name again for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Robert A. Frazier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, you have appeared heretofore to testify\r\nabout certain tests which you have conducted, but at this phase of the\r\nrecord, will you state briefly your occupation and your specialty,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I am a special agent assigned to the FBI laboratory,\r\nthe firearms identification unit in Washington, D.C., where I make\r\nexaminations of bullets, cartridges, gunpowder tests, bullet holes,\r\nexaminations of clothing, and other similar types of examinations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the course of your duties have you had an occasion\r\nto examine the clothing which was purportedly worn by President John\r\nKennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have that clothing with you at the present\r\ntime, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I have certain parts of it. I have the coat, shirt, tie,\r\nand the bandages and support belt which he allegedly was wearing that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you refer at this time to the coat, if you please,\r\nwhich, may the record show, has heretofore been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit 393.\r\n\r\nAnd by referring to that coat will you describe what, if anything, you\r\nobserved on the rear side of the coat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There was located on the rear of the coat 5-3/8 inches\r\nbelow the top of the collar, a hole, further located as 1-3/4 inches to\r\nthe right of the midline or the seam down the center of the coat; all\r\nof these being as you look at the back of the coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What characteristics did you note, if any, on the nature\r\nof that hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I noticed that the hole penetrated both the outer and\r\nlining areas of the coat, that it was roughly circular in shape. When\r\nI first examined it it was approximately one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and the cloth fibers around the margins of the hole were\r\npushed inward at the time I first examined it in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any tests conducted on the coat disclose any metallic\r\nsubstance on that area of that hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. I had a spectrographer run an analysis of a\r\nportion of the hole which accounts for its being slightly enlarged at\r\nthe present time. He took a sample of cloth and made an analysis of it.\r\nI don't know actually whether I am expected to give the results of his\r\nanalysis or not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; would you please, or let me ask you first of all,\r\nwere those tests run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the\r\nregular course of its testing procedures?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have those results been made available to you through\r\nthe regular recordkeeping procedures of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you then please tell us what those tests disclose?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Traces of copper were found around the margins of the hole\r\nin the back of the coat, and as a control, a very small section under\r\nthe collar was taken, and no copper being found there, it was concluded\r\nthat the copper was foreign to the coat itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the characteristics of\r\nthat hole, which you consider to be important for the Commission's\r\nconsideration?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming that those clothes, that jacket, specifically,\r\nat this juncture, was worn by President Kennedy, and was in the same\r\ncondition when that hole was made as it is now, and at the time when\r\nyou made your examination, do you have a professional opinion as to\r\nwhat caused that hole in the back of the jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I would say that it was an entrance hole for a\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the reason for that conclusion, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It has all the physical appearance characteristics which\r\nare considered when examining holes, such as its shape, its size, and\r\nin particular the fact that the fibers around the margins of the hole\r\nwere all pushed inward where the cloth was torn by the object which\r\npassed through, and the fibers were unraveled as they were pushed\r\ninward, which is characteristic of a entrance-type bullet hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the presence of the metallic substance relevant in your\r\nconclusion that it was a bullet hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not necessarily. It is a factor which corroborates that\r\nopinion but even without it, it would still have been my opinion that\r\nit was a bullet entrance hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you tell the size of the bullet from the hole in the\r\njacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The hole in the jacket is approximately a quarter of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that hole be consistent with a hole which would be\r\ncaused by a 6.5 millimeter bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; the actual bullet which makes a hole cannot be\r\ndetermined because the cloth in one instance may stretch more than\r\nit does in another instance causing either a larger or smaller hole\r\neven for the same caliber, but it is consistent for a bullet of 6.5\r\nmillimeters in diameter to make a hole of approximately this size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any holes indicative of being bullet holes\r\nfound on the front part of the President's jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have further occasion to examine the President's\r\nshirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that the shirt has heretofore been\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit 394?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; it may be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you observe then on the back side\r\nof the shirt, Mr. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I found on the back of the shirt a hole, 5-3/4 inches\r\nbelow the top of the collar, and as you look at the back of the shirt\r\n1-1/8 inch to the right of the midline of the shirt, which is this hole\r\nI am indicating.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show the witness is examining the shirt, as\r\nhe has the coat, to indicate the hole to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The record may show that.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In connection with this hole, I made the same examination\r\nas I did on the coat, Exhibit 393. I found the same situation to\r\nprevail, that is the hole was approximately circular in shape, about\r\none-fourth inch in diameter, and again the physical shape of it is\r\ncharacteristic of a bullet hole, that is the edges are frayed, and\r\nthere are slight radial tears in the cloth, which is characteristic\r\nof a bullet having passed through the cloth, and further, the fibers\r\naround the margin of the hole were--had been pressed inward, and\r\nassuming that, when I first examined the shirt it was in the same\r\ncondition as it was at the time the hole was made, it is my opinion\r\nthat this hole, in addition, was caused by a bullet entering the shirt\r\nfrom the back at that point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that hole consistent with having been caused by a 6.5\r\nmillimeter bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the front side of the shirt, what, if any,\r\nhole did you find there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Only one hole.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask one question there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is the hole in the shirt and the hole in the coat you have\r\njust described in a position that indicates that the same instrument,\r\nwhatever it was, or the same bullet, made the two?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they are. They are both--the coat hole is 5-3/8\r\ninches below the top of the collar. The shirt hole is 5-3/4 inches,\r\nwhich could be accounted for by a portion of the collar sticking up\r\nabove the coat about a half inch.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. And they are both located approximately the same distance\r\nto the right of the midline of both garments.\r\n\r\nNow, on the front of the shirt, I found what amounts to one hole.\r\nActually, it is a hole through both the button line of the shirt and\r\nthe buttonhole line which overlap down the front of the shirt when it\r\nis buttoned.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This hole is located immediately below the button being\r\ncentered seven-eighths of an inch below the button on the shirt, and\r\nsimilarly seven-eighths of an inch below the buttonhole on the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You are speaking of the collar button itself, aren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The collar button.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In each instance for these holes, the one through the\r\nbutton line and the one through the buttonhole line, the hole amounts\r\nto a ragged slit approximately one-half inch in height. It is oriented\r\nvertically, and the fibers of the cloth are protruding outward,\r\nthat is, have been pushed from the inside out. I could not actually\r\ndetermine from the characteristics of the hole whether or not it\r\nwas caused by a bullet. However, I can say that it was caused by a\r\nprojectile of some type which exited from the shirt at that point and\r\nthat is again assuming that when I first examined the shirt it was--it\r\nhad not been altered from the condition it was in at the time the hole\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What characteristics differ between the hole in the rear\r\nof the shirt and the holes in the front of the shirt which lead you to\r\nconclude that the hole in the rear of the shirt was caused by a bullet\r\nbut which are absent as to the holes in the front of the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The hole in the front of the shirt does not have the round\r\ncharacteristic shape caused by a round bullet entering cloth. It is an\r\nirregular slit. It could have been caused by a round bullet, however,\r\nsince the cloth could have torn in a long slitlike way as the bullet\r\npassed through it. But that is not specifically characteristic of a\r\nbullethole to the extent that you could say it was to the exclusion of\r\nbeing a piece of bone or some other type of projectile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the characteristics of the\r\nfront of the shirt holes which you consider to be important?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there. If the bullet, after\r\nentering, hit something that made it tumble or change, would that\r\naccount for this change in the appearance of the exit through the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I think not. In my opinion it would not have been\r\nnecessary, if I may put it that way, for the bullet to have turned\r\nsideways or partially sideways in order to make an elongated hole.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I think the effect in the front of the shirt is due more\r\nto the strength of the material being more in the horizontal rather\r\nthan the vertical direction which caused the cloth to tear vertically\r\nrather than due to a change in the shape or size of the bullet or\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or possibly the velocity of the bullet at that place, would\r\nthat have anything to do with it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I think the hole would not have been affected unless it\r\nwas a very large change in velocity.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Frazier, I notice that the front of the shirt\r\nimmediately around the hole you have just been describing and in fact\r\non much of the front of the shirt is bloodsoaked. Would that, with the\r\nother evidences you have seen there indicate to you as an expert that\r\nthis was the exit of the bullet that had entered in the back of the\r\ncoat as you have described it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The presence of the blood would have in my opinion no\r\nvalue for determining which was entrance or exit, because I have seen\r\nentrance wounds which bleed extensively and exit wounds which bleed not\r\nat all and vice versa. It depends entirely on the type of bullet which\r\nstrikes, whether or not it mutilates itself in the body, and probably\r\nmore importantly it depends on the position of the person who is shot\r\nafter the shooting occurs as to where the blood will be located on the\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May I put it this way, probably a little better. Do the\r\nevidences that you see on this shirt indicate to you that this hole in\r\nthe front of the shirt that you have just described was made by the\r\nbullet which entered in the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I can say that this hole in the collar area could have\r\nbeen made by this bullet but I cannot say that the bullet which entered\r\nthe back actually came out here or at some other place because I am not\r\naware of the autopsy information as to the path of the bullet through\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. But if the path of the bullet was such that it came\r\nthrough the body at the right angle, then one bullet could have caused\r\nboth holes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Could have caused both holes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is sufficient.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it correct that the blood on the shirt might well have\r\nbeen occasioned by the second wound rather than exclusively by the\r\nfirst wound?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it could have come from any other wound on the body\r\nas well as this one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you refer to any other wound, Mr. Frazier, are\r\nyou referring to the head wound which is widely known to have been\r\ninflicted on the President at the time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to examine the President's tie or\r\nthe tie purportedly worn by the President on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show at this juncture that that tie has\r\nheretofore been marked as Commission Exhibit 395?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; it may show that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you note, if anything, with respect to the tie,\r\nMr. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. When the tie was examined by me in the laboratory I noted\r\nthat the neck portion had been cut from one side of the knot. However,\r\nthe knot remained in apparently its original condition. The only damage\r\nto the tie other than the fact that it had been cut, was a crease or\r\nnick in the left side of the tie when you consider the tie as being\r\nworn on a body. As you view the front of the tie it would be on the\r\nright side. This nick would be located in a corresponding area to the\r\narea in the shirt collar just below the button.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you now indicate on your own tie, you are indicating on\r\nthe portion of the tie to your right?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. If it was on my tie it would be on the left side of the\r\ntie.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Your left side.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The left side of my tie. There is a nick on the left side\r\nof the tie if you consider it as left and right according to the person\r\nwearing the tie.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the nick in the tie provide any indication of the\r\ndirection of the missile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The nick is elongated horizontally, indicating a possible\r\nhorizontal direction but it does not indicate that the projectile which\r\ncaused it was exiting or entering at that point. The fibers were not\r\ndisturbed in a characteristic manner which would permit any conclusion\r\nin that connection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the nick consistent with an exiting path?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any indication from the nature of the nick as to\r\nthe nature of the projectile itself?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the nick consistent with a 6.5 millimeter bullet having\r\ncaused the nick?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes. Any projectile could have caused the nick. In this\r\nconnection there was no metallic residue found on the tie, and for that\r\nmatter there was no metallic residue found on the shirt at the holes in\r\nthe front. However, there was in the back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any of the other----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excuse me, on the back of the coat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Back of the coat and on the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any of the other items of President Kennedy's clothing\r\nwhich you have heretofore referred to contain any indications at all of\r\nany bullet holes or any other type of holes?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, did you have occasion to examine the clothing\r\nwhich has heretofore been identified in prior Commission proceedings\r\nas that worn by Governor Connally on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you what purports to be the Governor's coat,\r\nand may the record show that has been heretofore marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 683?\r\n\r\n(At this point the Chairman left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES [presiding]. The record may so show.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had opportunity heretofore to examine that coat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did your examination reveal with respect to the back\r\nside of the coat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There was found on the coat by me when I first examined\r\nit, near the right sleeve 1-1/8 inches from the seam where the sleeve\r\nattaches to the coat, and 7-1/4 inches to the right of the midline\r\nwhen you view the back of the coat, a hole which is elongated in a\r\nhorizontal direction to the length of approximately five-eights of an\r\ninch, and which had an approximate one-quarter inch height.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to determine from your examination of the\r\nGovernor's clothing whether or not they had been cleaned and pressed\r\nprior to the time you saw them?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they had.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that different from or the same as the condition of the\r\nPresident's clothing which you have just described this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It is different in that the President's clothing had not\r\nbeen cleaned. It had only been dried. The blood was dried. However, the\r\nGovernor's garments had been cleaned and pressed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the President's clothing been pressed then?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you proceed to describe any other characteristics----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had been dried artificially or let nature take its course?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It appeared to be air dried.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Air dried, artificially?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I couldn't say whether any outside heat had been applied\r\nbut it did not appear that any heat had been applied to the blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. On the hole on the back of the coat although it had the\r\ngeneral appearance and could have been a bullet hole, possibly because\r\nof the cleaning and pressing of the garment. I cannot state that it\r\nactually is a bullet hole nor the direction of the path of the bullet,\r\nif it were a bullet hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the nature of the opening consistent with being a\r\nbullet hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is it consistent with a bullet hole caused by a\r\nmissile traveling from the back to the front of the wearer of the\r\ngarment?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I could not determine that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You couldn't determine that it was, but could it have been?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It could have been, yes; either way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Will you now turn to the front side of the coat\r\nand state what, if any, damage you observed on the body of the garment?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. When considered from the wearer's standpoint, on the right\r\nchest area of the coat there is a hole through the lining and the outer\r\nlayer of the coat which is located 6-1/2 inches from the right side\r\nseam line and also 6-1/2 inches from the armpit which places this hole\r\napproximately 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the coat.\r\n\r\nThis hole was approximately circular in shape, three-eights of an inch\r\nin diameter, and again possibly because of the cleaning and pressing\r\nof the garment, I could not determine whether it actually was a bullet\r\nhole or whether or not it entered or exited if it were a bullet hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the hole consistent with being an exit bullet hole?\r\nThat is to say, could it have been caused by an exiting bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you find any damage on the right sleeve of the jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; on more or less the top portion of the right\r\nsleeve very near the end of the sleeve there is a very rough hole which\r\npenetrates both the outside layer, the lining and the inside layer of\r\nthe sleeve.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe sufficient characteristics to\r\nformulate any conclusion as to the cause of that tear?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This also did not indicate direction from the condition of\r\nthe fibers, possibly due to the cleaning and pressing of the garment.\r\n\r\nHowever, it could have been a bullet which struck the garment at an\r\nangle to the surface which caused a slight elongation. The hole was\r\napproximately five-eights of an inch in length, and three-eights of\r\nan inch in width. The elongation could also have been the result of a\r\nmutilated bullet having struck the garment or it could have been caused\r\nby a fold in the garment at the time the object or bullet struck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to examine the shirt, which was\r\npurportedly worn by Governor Connally, and which has heretofore been\r\nidentified by the Governor in Commission proceedings, as that worn by\r\nhim on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show at this point that Mr. Frazier is\r\nexamining the shirt heretofore identified on the back side with a\r\nphotograph marked Commission Exhibit 685 and on the front side with a\r\nphotograph marked Commission Exhibit 686.\r\n\r\nNow, referring to that shirt, Mr. Frazier, what, if anything, did you\r\nobserve on the rear side by way of an imperfection, hole or defect?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I found a hole which is very ragged. An L-shaped tear\r\nactually is what it amounted to in the back of the shirt near the right\r\nsleeve, 2 inches from the seam line where the sleeve attaches to the\r\nshirt, and 7-1/2 inches to the right of the midline of the shirt, the\r\nright side being as you look at the back of the shirt.\r\n\r\nThis tear amounted to a five-eights of an inch long horizontal and\r\napproximately one-half inch long vertical break in the cloth, with a\r\nvery small tear located immediately to its right, as you look at the\r\nback of the shirt, which was approximately three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nThis hole corresponds in position to the hole in the back of the coat,\r\nGovernor Connally's coat, identified as Commission No. 683.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there sufficient characteristics observable to\r\nformulate a conclusion as to the cause and direction of that hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; there were no characteristics on which you could\r\nbase a conclusion as to what caused it, whether or not it was a bullet\r\nand if it had been, what the direction of the projectile was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could it have been caused by a 6.5-mm. bullet coming from\r\nthe rear of the wearer toward his front?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Referring now to the front side of the Governor's shirt,\r\nwhat, if anything, did you observe with respect to a tear or a hole\r\nthereon, as to the body of the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER, I found in the right chest area of the shirt, considering\r\nthe shirt when it is being worn, a very irregular tear more or less\r\nin the form of an \"H,\" of the letter \"H.\" This tear was approximately\r\n1-1/2 inches in height, with the crossbar tear being approximately 1\r\ninch in width, which caused a very irregularly shaped and enlarged\r\nhole in the front of the shirt. The hole is located 5 inches from the\r\nright-side seam, and 9 inches below the top of the right sleeve. The\r\n9-inch figure is from the top of the right shoulder where the sleeve\r\nadjoins the yoke of the shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had that garment been cleaned and pressed, Mr. Frazier,\r\nprior to the time you examined it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there sufficient characteristics then remaining on\r\nthe hole on the front side to enable you to formulate an opinion as to\r\nthe cause of the hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could it have been caused by a 6.5 millimeter bullet\r\nexiting from the chest of the Governor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, it could.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now what, if anything----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask there, would the size and character of this\r\nhole indicate the condition of the bullet, I mean as to whether it was\r\ntumbling or whether it was a mutilated bullet or anything of that kind?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it would not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Even a bullet in full flight, full velocity could have made\r\nthis kind of a hole in the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It could have, particularly if the shirt had been wrinkled\r\nat the time it passed through, and particularly because the material in\r\nthis shirt tore rather severely at the time the object passed through,\r\nindicating a very weak structure of the cotton fiber, so that it would\r\ntear out of all proportion to a stronger fabric.\r\n\r\nAnd for that reason, the shape of the hole could be affected by the\r\ncondition of the material as well as any folds in the material or, as\r\nyou say, by a mutilated bullet or a passage of a bullet through the\r\ncloth at an angle to the surface or the passing of a bullet partially\r\nsideways through the cloth.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Will you proceed?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, what, if any, defect or hole did you observe\r\non the right sleeve of the Governor's shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I found in the cuff of the shirt which is a French cuff,\r\nthrough both the outer and inner layers of the cuff, a hole which is\r\nragged in contour, irregularly shaped, and which had more or less\r\nstar-shaped tears extending outward from the hole into the material,\r\nlocated 1-1/2 inches up from the end of the sleeve, and 5-1/2 inches\r\nfrom the outside cuff link hole, through both, as I said, through both\r\nlayers of the cuff, and the hole was in such a condition, possibly\r\ndue to the washing of the material, that I could not determine what\r\nactually caused it or if it had been caused by a bullet, the direction\r\nof the path of the bullet with reference to entrance and exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could those holes have been caused by a bullet passing\r\nthrough the Governor's wrist from the dorsal or upper portion to the\r\nvolar or palmar side?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they could.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to examine the trousers which have\r\nbeen heretofore identified in Commission hearings as those worn by\r\nGovernor Connally on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Mr. Frazier has taken and is\r\nobserving the trousers which have been identified in the record,\r\nthrough a picture of the front side, bearing Commission Exhibit No. 687\r\nand a picture of the rear side bearing Commission Exhibit No. 688.\r\n\r\nNow, referring to those trousers, what if anything did you observe in\r\nthe nature of a defect or hole, Mr. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In the area which would be the left-knee area of the\r\nperson wearing the trousers, there was a hole which is roughly circular\r\nin shape, and approximately one-quarter of an inch in diameter with\r\nsome possible expansion of the hole due to slight tearing of the cloth\r\nat the outer margins of the hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the trousers been cleaned and pressed prior to your\r\nexamination?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there sufficient characteristics available for you to\r\nformulate any conclusion as to the cause of that hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I can say that it had the general appearance of a\r\nbullet hole but I could not determine the direction of the bullet if,\r\nin fact, it had been caused by a bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What are the characteristics which led you to believe that\r\nit had the characteristics of a bullet hole?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It has the roughly circular shape with slight tearing away\r\nfrom the edges of the material.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other hole on the trousers which could be a\r\nhole of exit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, did you have occasion to examine an\r\nautomobile which was the vehicle used customarily by the President of\r\nthe United States in parades?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did that examination occur?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In the early morning hours of November 23, 1963, at the\r\nSecret Service garage here in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph previously identified for the\r\nrecord as Commission Exhibit No. 344 and ask you if that depicts the\r\ncar which you examined?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you a subsequent exhibit of the Commission, No.\r\n346, showing the interior view of the automobile and ask you if that\r\ndepicts the automobile which you examined?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; however, it wasn't in this condition. It wasn't\r\nas clean as it is in Exhibit 346.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition with respect to cleanliness?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There were blood and particles of flesh scattered all over\r\nthe hood, the windshield, in the front seat and all over the rear floor\r\nrugs, the jump seats, and over the rear seat, and down both sides of\r\nthe side rails or tops of the doors of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that condition depicted by Commission Exhibits 352 and\r\n353 to the extent that they show the interior of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the purpose of the examination which you made of\r\nthe car at that time and place?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I examined the car to determine whether or not there were\r\nany bullet fragments present in it, embedded in the upholstery of the\r\nback of the front seat, or whether there were any impact areas which\r\nindicated that bullets or bullet fragments struck the inside of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the fragments first, what did your\r\nexamination disclose?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. We found three small lead particles lying on the rug in\r\nthe rear seat area. These particles were located underneath or in the\r\narea which would be underneath the left jump seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have those particles been identified during the course of\r\nyour prior testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they have not?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you produce them at this time then, please? May we\r\nassign to this group of particles Commission Exhibit No. 840?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These have not been discussed before, have they?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. They have not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It shall be admitted as Commission Exhibit No. 840.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 840 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I move formally for their admission, then, into evidence\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They shall be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe the three pieces of metal which are\r\ncontained within this vial, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The three pieces of metal are lead. They were weighed\r\nimmediately upon recovery and were found to weigh nine-tenths of\r\na grain, seven-tenths of a grain, and seven-tenths of a grain,\r\nrespectively. Since that time small portions have been removed for\r\nspectrographic analysis and comparison with other bullets and bullet\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has that comparison been made with a whole bullet\r\nheretofore identified as Commission Exhibit 399 which in other\r\nproceedings has been identified as the bullet from the Connally\r\nstretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; the comparison was made by comparing Exhibit\r\n399 with a bullet fragment found in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine and then comparing that fragment with these fragments from\r\nthe rear seat of the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For identification purposes, has that fragment from the\r\nfront seat been heretofore identified during your prior testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it has. It bears Commission No. 567.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what did the comparative examination then disclose as\r\namong Commission Exhibits 399, 567, and 840?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That examination was performed by a spectrographer, John\r\nF. Gallagher, and I do not have the results of his examinations here,\r\nalthough I did ascertain that it was determined that the lead fragments\r\nwere similar in composition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that they could have come from, so that the fragments\r\ndesignated 840 could have come from the same bullet as fragment\r\ndesignated 567?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the tests sufficient to indicate conclusively whether\r\nfragments 840 did come from the fragment designated as 567?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you personally find any other fragments in the\r\nPresident's car during the course of your examination?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, where, according to information provided to you then,\r\nwas the fragment designated Commission Exhibit 567 found?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That was found by the Secret Service upon their\r\nexamination of the limousine here in Washington when it first arrived\r\nfrom Dallas, and Commission No. 567 was delivered by Deputy Chief\r\nPaul Paterni and by a White House detail chief, Floyd M. Boring, to a\r\nliaison agent of the FBI, Orrin Bartlett, who delivered them to me in\r\nthe laboratory at 11:50 p.m., on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that constitute the total chain of possession then\r\nfrom the finder with the Secret Service into your hands, as reflected\r\non the records of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there another fragment, was there any other fragment\r\nfound in the front seat of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes. Alongside the right side of the front seat,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 569, which is the base portion of the jacket of\r\na bullet, was found, and handled in identical manner to the Exhibit 567.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the front seat is the seat which would be the driver's\r\nseat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the Secret Service man on his right, I believe?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was the seat from which this came?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Commission Exhibit 567 was found on the seat right beside\r\nthe driver, and Exhibit 569 was found on the floor beside the right\r\nside of the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The right side of the front seat, Mr. Dulles, as the\r\nprior testimony shows was occupied by Roy Kellerman and the driver was\r\nWilliam Greer.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Right. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state what the chain of possession was from\r\nthe time of discovery of Exhibit 569 until the time it came into your\r\npossession, based on the records of the FBI, please, if you have those\r\nrecords available?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. It was delivered by Secret Service Deputy Chief\r\nPaul Paterni, and SAC of the White House detail Floyd M. Boring of the\r\nSecret Service again, to Special Agent Orrin Bartlett of the FBI who\r\ndelivered it to me at 11:50 p.m. on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the records which you have just referred to relating\r\nto the chain of possession of Exhibits 567 and 569 maintained by you in\r\nthe normal course of your duties as an examiner of those items?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, is it possible for the fragments identified\r\nin Commission Exhibit 840 to have come from the whole bullet heretofore\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit 399?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say that based on weight it would be highly\r\nimprobable that that much weight could have come from the base of that\r\nbullet since its present weight is--its weight when I first received it\r\nwas 158.6 grains.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Referring now to 399.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Exhibit 399, and its original normal weight would be 160\r\nto 161 grains, and those three metal fragments had a total of 2.1\r\ngrains as I recall--2.3 grains. So it is possible but not likely since\r\nthere is only a very small part of the core of the bullet 399 missing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the bullet fragments which\r\nyou found in the President's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it your job to analyze all of the bullets or bullet\r\nfragments which were found in the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it was, except for the spectrographic analysis of the\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the bullet fragments which\r\nwere brought to you by anyone else and identified as having been found\r\nin the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; not this morning but at previous times during my\r\ntestimony I have; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But then there is on the record now all of the\r\nidentification of the metallic or bullet fragments found in connection\r\nwith your examination of the President's car or which were examined by\r\nyou after having been found by someone else?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. There is one other, it is not a metal particle\r\nbut it is a residue of metal on the inside of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from that residue of the windshield which I am going\r\nto come to now, have we placed on the record a description of all of\r\nthe bullets or bullet fragments?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one moment. You mean bullet fragments related to the\r\ncar or bullet fragments found anywhere?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Related to the President's automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; you have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion then to examine the windshield of\r\nthe Presidential limousine?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did that examination disclose?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. On the inside surface of the windshield there was a\r\ndeposit of lead. This deposit was located when you look at the inside\r\nsurface of the windshield, 13-1/2 inches down from the top, 23 inches\r\nfrom the left-hand side or driver's side of the windshield, and was\r\nimmediately in front of a small pattern of star-shaped cracks which\r\nappeared in the outer layer of the laminated windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What do you mean by the \"outer layer of the laminated\r\nwindshield\"?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The windshield is composed of two layers with a very thin\r\nlayer of plastic in between which bonds them together in the form of\r\nsafety glass. The inside layer of the glass was not broken, but the\r\noutside layer immediately on the outside of the lead residue had a very\r\nsmall pattern of cracks and there was a very minute particle of glass\r\nmissing from the outside surface.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the outside surface was the surface away from where the\r\noccupants were sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is correct; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the inside surface was the surface nearest the\r\noccupants?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do those characteristics indicate as to which side of\r\nthe windshield was struck?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It indicates that it could only have been struck on the\r\ninside surface. It could not have been struck on the outside surface\r\nbecause of the manner in which the glass broke and further because of\r\nthe lead residue on the inside surface. The cracks appear in the outer\r\nlayer of the glass because the glass is bent outward at the time of\r\nimpact which stretches the outer layer of the glass to the point where\r\nthese small radial or wagon spoke-wagon wheel spoke-type cracks appear\r\non the outer surface.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So the pressure must have come from the inside and not from\r\nthe outside against the glass?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As far as the car is concerned from the back to the front?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Not from outside against the glass--from the front against\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was a comparison made of the lead residues on the inside\r\nof the windshield with any of the bullet fragments recovered about\r\nwhich you have heretofore testified?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes. They were compared with the bullet fragment found on\r\nthe front seat, which in turn was compared with Commission 399. The\r\nlead was found to be similar in composition. However, that examination\r\nin detail was made by a spectrographer, Special Agent John F. Gallagher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that examination made in the regular course of\r\nexamining procedures by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that information made available to you through the\r\nnormal conference procedures among FBI examiners?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. He submitted his report to me and I prepared the\r\nformal report of the entire examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are his report and your formal report a part of the\r\npermanent record of the FBI then?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you Commission Exhibit No. 350 which has\r\nheretofore been identified as a picture of the windshield of the\r\nPresidential limousine and I ask you if that is the crack about which\r\nyou have just testified?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it is. This Exhibit 350 is a photograph which I took\r\non the 23d of November, showing a view from the front toward the rear\r\nof the Presidential limousine and showing the crack in the glass and\r\nthe lead residue on the inside surface.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you produce at this time the lead residue obtained\r\nby you from that inside surface, please? May it please the Commission,\r\nI would like to mark this as Commission Exhibit 841 and move for its\r\nadmission into evidence at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It shall be admitted into evidence.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 841 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I just ask a question of you, Mr. Specter, and possibly\r\nof the witness.\r\n\r\nI assume that the windshield we are now discussing is the windshield\r\nthat was exhibited to the Commission several weeks ago and which\r\nmembers of the Commission examined?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It was, Mr. Dulles, and we can establish that, of record,\r\nthrough another Commission Exhibit which is 351, which was the number\r\ngiven to the windshield and we have a reproduction here through the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You don't have the windshield here today, though?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No, we do not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It would be the same windshield that the Commission saw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We can establish it through the witness, too.\r\n\r\nMr. Frazier, for that purpose can you identify what is depicted in a\r\nphotograph heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit 351?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; this is a photograph of the very small pattern\r\nof cracks in the windshield which was on the Presidential limousine\r\nat the time I examined it, and which I also later examined in the FBI\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, have you now described all of your findings\r\non the windshield of the Presidential limousine?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; that is concerning the glass itself and not the\r\nmolding around the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you then move to the molding around the windshield\r\nand state what, if anything, you found there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. On the strip of chrome which goes across the top of the\r\nwindshield and again on the passenger side of the windshield or the\r\ninside surface, I found a dent in the chrome which had been caused by\r\nsome projectile which struck the chrome on the inside surface.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there one dent or more than one dent or what?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. One dent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you identify what is depicted by a photograph\r\nheretofore marked as Commission Exhibit 349?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; this is a photograph which I took of this dent\r\nat that time, showing the damaged chrome, just to the right of the\r\nrearview mirror support at the top of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did your examination of the President's limousine disclose\r\nany other holes or markings which could have conceivably been caused by\r\na bullet striking the automobile or any part of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if I could go back just a moment to the\r\nindentation in the chrome around the windshield at the top of the\r\nwindshield, but on the inside, could that have been caused by a\r\nfragment of a bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, it very easily could have. It would not have been\r\ncaused, for instance, by a bullet which was traveling at its full\r\nvelocity from a rifle, but merely from a fragment traveling at fairly\r\nhigh velocity which struck the inside surface of the chrome.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could that have been caused by any of the fragments that\r\nyou have identified as having been found on the front seat or near the\r\nfront seat of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I believe it could have by either, in fact, of the\r\ntwo fragments of rifle bullets found in the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, assume certain facts to be true for\r\npurposes of expressing an opinion on a hypothetical situation, to\r\nwit: that President Kennedy was struck by a 6.5 millimeter bullet\r\nwhich passed through his body entering on the rear portion of his\r\nneck 14 centimeters to the left of his right acromion process and 14\r\ncentimeters below his mastoid process, with a striking velocity of\r\napproximately 1,904 feet per second, and exited after passing through\r\na fascia channel in his body, through the lower anterior third of his\r\nneck with an exit velocity of approximately 1,772 to 1,779 feet per\r\nsecond; and that bullet had then traveled from the point where it\r\nexited from his neck and struck the front windshield in some manner.\r\nWhat effect would that have had on the front windshield and the\r\nsubsequent flight of the missile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It would have shattered the front windshield. It would\r\nhave caused a very large, relatively large hole, approximately\r\nthree-eighths to an inch in diameter with radiating cracks extending\r\noutward into the glass for several inches, even to the side of the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It would have penetrated the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the missile then have proceeded in a forward\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it would.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an opinion as to how far it would have gone?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Until it struck some other object in the area of\r\napproximately a mile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now assume the same sequence with respect to exit velocity\r\nfrom the point of the President's neck at the same rate of 1,772\r\nto 1,798 feet per second, and assume still further that the bullet\r\nhad, the whole bullet had, struck the metal framing which you have\r\nheretofore described and identified. What effect would that have had on\r\nthe metal framing?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It would have torn a hole in the chrome, penetrated the\r\nframing both inside and outside of the car. I can only assume, since\r\nI haven't tested the metal of that particular car, I would assume\r\nthat the bullet would completely penetrate both the chrome, the metal\r\nsupporting the chrome, on the inside, and the body metal on the outside\r\nwhich supports the windshield of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, assume the same set of factors as to the exit\r\nvelocity from the President's neck. What effect would that bullet have\r\nhad on any other portion of the automobile which it might have struck\r\nin the continuation of its flight?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In my opinion it would have penetrated any other metal\r\nsurface and, of course, any upholstery surface depending on the\r\nnature of the material as to how deep it would penetrate or how many\r\nsuccessive layers it may have penetrated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any evidence in any portion of the car that the\r\nautomobile was struck by a bullet which exited from the President's\r\nneck under the circumstances which I have just asked you to assume?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; there was not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And had there been any such evidence would your\r\nexamination of the automobile have uncovered such an indication or such\r\nevidence?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I feel that it would have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was your examination a thorough examination of all aspects\r\nof the interior of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; for our purpose. However, we did not tear out\r\nall of the rugs on the floor, for instance. We examined the rugs\r\ncarefully for holes, for bullet furroughs, for fragments. We examined\r\nthe nap of the rug, in the actual nap of the rug, for fragments and\r\nbullet holes. We pulled the rug back as far as we could turn it back\r\nand even tore the glue or adhesive material loose around the cracks\r\nat the edges of the rug so we could observe the cracks to see whether\r\nthey had been enlarged, and we examined all of the upholstery covering,\r\non the back of the front seat, on the doors, and in the rear seat\r\ncompartment, the jump seats, the actual rear seat, the back of the rear\r\nseat, and we examined the front seat in a similar manner, and we found\r\nno bullet holes or other bullet impact areas, other than the one on the\r\ninside of the windshield and the dent inside the windshield chrome.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had any of those portions of the automobile been struck by\r\nthe bullet exiting from the President's neck, which I have described\r\nhypothetically for you, would you have found some evidence of striking?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When was this examination made?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Between 2 and 4:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was about 10 hours, 12 hours after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; 14 to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Fourteen to sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask, do you know in whose custody the automobile was\r\nprior to your examination from the time it was shipped on the airplane?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. When I arrived there were two Secret Service men present\r\nbut I do not recall their names. They were introduced to me, and they\r\nwere there during the entire examination but I don't recall their\r\nactual names. The car was under guard in the Secret Service garage in\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nOther than that I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this a joint examination by you and by the Secret\r\nService or was the examination made by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; by the FBI at the request of the Secret Service\r\nwho had already examined the interior of the car for personal effects\r\nand other items.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did they certify to you or advise you that the car had been\r\nunder their custody during this 14-to 16-hour period?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I don't recall whether they actually stated that. What\r\nthey stated was that the car had immediately been flown to Washington\r\nand placed in this garage and kept under surveillance the entire time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was a fragment of metal brought to you which was\r\nidentified as coming from the wrist of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was identified to me as having come from the arm of\r\nGovernor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you produce that fragment at this time, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This one does not have a Commission number as yet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, I would like to have this\r\nfragment marked as Commission Exhibit 842.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 842 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, referring to a fragment heretofore marked as Q9 for\r\nFBI record purposes, and now marked as Commission Exhibit No. 842, will\r\nyou describe that fragment for us, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; this is a small fragment of metal which weighed\r\none-half a grain when I first examined it in the laboratory. It is a\r\npiece of lead, and could have been a part of a bullet or a core of a\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nHowever, it lacks any physical characteristics which would permit\r\nstating whether or not it actually originated from a bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are its physical characteristics consistent with having\r\ncome from Commission Exhibit 399?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it could have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are they consistent with that fragment identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 842, as having come from fragment identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit 567?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Which is 567?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. 567 is the one which was found on the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it could have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the characteristics of the fragment identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit 842 consistent with having come from the fragment\r\nheretofore identified as Commission Exhibit 569?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you set forth from the records of the FBI, if\r\nyou have those before you, the chain of possession of the fragment\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit 842, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Commission Exhibit 842, that is the one from Governor\r\nConnally's arm, was delivered to me in the FBI laboratory on November\r\n23, 1963, by Special Agent Vincent E. Drain of the Dallas Office of the\r\nFBI, who stated he had secured this item from Capt. Will Fritz of the\r\nDallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nI do not know where Captain Fritz obtained it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Referring back for just a moment to the coat identified as\r\nthat worn by Governor Connally, Mr. Frazier, was there any observable\r\nangle of elevation or declination from the back side of the Governor's\r\ncoat to the front side of the Governor's coat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; there was, approximately a 35-degree downward\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Measuring from----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Back to front or front to back?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. From back towards the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the same question as to the Governor's shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say it was approximately the same angle or\r\nslightly less. I think we measured approximately 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that from the front to back or from the back to front\r\nof the Governor's shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That would be from the back towards the front. Downward\r\nfrom back towards the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Dulles, those questions complete the ones which we\r\nhave to ask, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Frazier, one additional question: Do you have any knowledge through\r\nany source whatsoever of any bullets or bullet fragments found anywhere\r\nin the vicinity of the assassination other than those which you have\r\nalready testified to, which were in the car, or the whole bullet from\r\nthe Connally stretcher or the fragments from Governor Connally's wrist?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I have never heard of any nor have any been\r\nsubmitted to me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. During the regular processing of the FBI examination in\r\nthis case, would all such bullets or bullet fragments be brought to\r\nyou for examination in accordance with your assignment to this matter\r\ngenerally?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they would.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any metallic fragments brought to you which were\r\npurported to have been found in the head of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or body?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or body of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1963, at 1:35 a.m., the two metal fragments in this\r\ncontainer were delivered to me in the FBI laboratory by Special Agent\r\nJames W. Sibert, and Special Agent Francis O'Neill of the Baltimore\r\noffice of the FBI who stated they had obtained these in the autopsy\r\nroom at the Naval Hospital near Washington, D.C., where they were\r\npresent when they were removed from the head of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any specification as to the portion of the\r\nPresident's head from which they were removed?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they told me that there had been numerous\r\nparticles in the head but only these two had been removed, the others\r\nbeing very small.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission I would like to have those\r\nmarked and admitted into evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 843.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It shall be so marked and admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 843 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the event we have not already had 842 admitted into\r\nevidence, I move, Mr. Dulles, for the admission into evidence of 842\r\nwhich was the fragment from Governor Connally's arm.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That shall be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Moving back to 843 will you describe those fragments\r\nindicating their weight and general composition?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. These fragments consisted of two pieces of lead, one\r\nweighed 1.65 grains. The other weighed .15 grain. They were examined\r\nspectrographically so their present weight would be somewhat less since\r\na very small amount would be needed for spectrographic analysis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was a comparison made between or among these two fragments\r\nwith the other metal from the bullets heretofore identified as\r\nCommission Exhibits 399, 567, 569, 840, and 842?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did that examination disclose?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Possibly my numbers do not agree with those you have.\r\nThese two particles from the President's head were compared with the\r\nlead of Exhibit 842.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which is the fragment from the arm of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they were compared with the lead scraping from\r\nthe inside of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which is Exhibit 841.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. And with the three lead fragments found on the rear\r\nfloorboard carpet of the limousine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which is Exhibit 840.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. And they were found to be similar in metallic composition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you state with any more certainty----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Excuse me, one thing. These, as a group, were compared\r\nwith the bullet fragment, Commission Exhibit 567, which was found on\r\nthe front seat of the automobile, which also was found to be similar in\r\nmetallic composition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it possible to state with any more certainty whether or\r\nnot any of those fragments came from the same bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not definitely, no; only that they are of similar lead\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described fully all of the relevant\r\ncharacteristics of the fragments identified as Commission Exhibit 843?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other bullets or bullet fragment or metallic\r\nsubstances of any sort connected with this case in any way which you\r\nhave examined which you have not already testified to here today or on\r\nyour prior appearance?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; that is all of them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there anything further?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much, Mr. Frazier.\r\n\r\nThe Commission will reconvene at 2:30.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ALFRED G. OLIVIER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 3 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nMr. Specter, has the doctor been sworn yet?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No, sir; he has not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Doctor, would you raise your right hand and be sworn,\r\nplease? Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in\r\nthe matter before this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth,\r\nand nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. State your full name for the record.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Dr. Alfred G. Olivier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation or profession?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. A supervisory research veterinarian and I work for the\r\nDepartment of the Army at Edgewood Arsenal, Md.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe the nature of your duties at that\r\narsenal, please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Investigating the wound ballistics of various bullets and\r\nother military missiles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe the general nature of the tests which\r\nare carried on at Edgewood Arsenal?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. For example, with a bullet we run tissue studies getting\r\nthe retardation of the bullet through the tissues, the penetration,\r\nvarious characteristics of it. We use as good tissue simulant 20\r\npercent gelatin. This has a drag coefficient of muscle tissue and makes\r\nan excellent homogenous medium to study the action of the bullet.\r\nWe also use animal parts and parts of cadavers where necessary to\r\ndetermine the characteristics of these things.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you set forth your educational background briefly,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did 2 years of preveterinary work at the University\r\nof New Hampshire and 4 years of veterinary school at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and I hold a degree doctor of veterinary medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what year did you complete your educational work?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. 1953.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline your experience in the field subsequent\r\nto 1953?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In this field?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I came to Edgewood Arsenal, then the Army Chemical Center,\r\nin 1957, and originally to work, take charge of the animal colonies but\r\nimmediately I got interested in the research and started working in\r\nthe field of wound ballistics and have been in it ever since, and am\r\npresently Chief of the Wound Ballistics Branch.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been in charge of a series of tests performed\r\nto determine certain wound ballistics on circumstances analogous to\r\nthe underlying facts on wounds inflicted upon President Kennedy and\r\nGovernor Connally on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in the course of those tests what weapon was used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It was identified as Commission Exhibit 139. It was a 6.5\r\nmm. Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the designation, Commission Exhibit No. 139, appear on\r\nthe body of that rifle?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What type of bullets were used in the tests which you\r\nperformed?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We used the Western ammunition, Western being a division\r\nof Olin Industries, Winchester Western, it was lot 6,000 to 6.5 mm.\r\nround. Has a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,160 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were those bullets obtained by you upon information\r\nprovided to you by the Commission's staff as to the identity of the\r\nbullets which were believed to have been used during the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I first got the identity from the people at Aberdeen\r\nProving Grounds and then I further checked with the Commission to see\r\nif that was right before ordering this type of ammunition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were those bullets obtained from?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I obtained 100 rounds from Remington at Bridgeport.\r\nConn., and Dr. Dziemian obtained another 160 rounds, I believe, from\r\nWinchester in New Haven.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you perform certain tests to determine the wound\r\nballistics and include in that the penetration power of the\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle, which you referred to, firing the Western\r\nCartridge Co. bullet by comparison with other types of bullets?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We didn't fire any of the others at the same time. These\r\nhad been fired previously. We have all these records for comparison.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle then fired for comparison\r\npurposes with the other bullets where you already had your experience?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No; it was fired for the purposes for which--to try to\r\nshed some light on say the factors leading to the assassination and\r\nall, not for comparison with the other bullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a photograph which is marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 844, may it please the Commission, and ask you if this\r\nphotograph was prepared by you in conjunction with the study on the\r\nMannlicher-Carcano and the Western Cartridge Co. bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you explain to the Commission what that photograph\r\ndepicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Actually, the bullet passed through two gelatin blocks.\r\nThis was done as part of an energy study to see the amount of energy\r\nimparted to the block of gelatin taking a high-speed motion picture.\r\nThese blocks show a record of the permanent cavity left in the gelatin.\r\nThis is not necessarily the total penetration. This bullet when it\r\ncomes out of the second block still has quite a bit of penetrating\r\npower. Quite a few of these bullets would go into a dirt bank and imbed\r\nthemselves so deeply that they couldn't be recovered.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you Commission Exhibit No. 845 which is a\r\nphotograph, and ask you to state for the record what that photograph\r\nrepresents?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This has been adopted as standard military ammunition of\r\nthe U.S. Army. It is known as the NATO round. It is M-80 ball fired\r\nin the M-14 rifle. It has a different--it is a full jacketed military\r\nbullet but has a different point, what they call a no jag point, a\r\nsharp point. It has tumbling characteristics. When it goes in a certain\r\nblock it tumbles and does the same in the body. It is more efficient in\r\nproducing wounds than the bullet under study.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How do the impact, penetration, and other characteristics\r\nof the bullet depicted in 845 compare with the Western Cartridge Co.\r\nbullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano in 844?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It has better wounding potential due to the quicker\r\ntumbling but it would not have as good penetrating ability, when it\r\nstarts tumbling and releasing all that energy doing all that damage it\r\ncomes to a stop in a shorter distance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the Western bullet be characterized as having the\r\nqualities of a more stable bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it would. You mean in the target?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The stability in the air would be the same for any\r\nmissile, would it not?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. To be a good bullet they should be stable in air in order\r\nto hit what you are aiming at, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then would the characteristics of stability in the air be\r\nthe same for either of the two bullets you have heretofore referred to?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Essentially so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you photograph marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n846 and ask you to state what that depicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a 257 Winchester Roberts soft nose hunting bullet.\r\nThis one pictured fired from right to left instead of left to right\r\nand the bullet didn't even go out of the block. It deforms almost\r\nimmediately on entering the block and releases its energy rather\r\nrapidly. This type of ammunition is illegal for military use. We are\r\njust studying the wounding characteristics of various bullets, but this\r\nis not a military bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does it compare with the Western bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It would be better for wounding, better for hunting\r\npurposes. But as I said, it isn't acceptable as a military bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does it compare with respect to penetration power?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Much less than the Mannlicher-Carcano.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the normal course of the work that you perform for\r\nthe U.S. Army at Edgewood Arsenal, do you have occasion to simulate\r\nsubstances for testing purposes on determining the path of a bullet\r\nthrough the human body?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; we do use animal tissues or gelatin as simulants for\r\ntissues of the human body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has the autopsy report on President John F. Kennedy been\r\nmade available to you for your review?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it has.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And subsequent to your review of that report, did you\r\nmake an effort to simulate the body tissue through which the bullet is\r\nreported to have passed through the President in accordance with the\r\nreport of the autopsy surgeon; entering on the rear of his neck, 14 cm.\r\nbelow the mastoid process and 14 cm. to the left of the right acromion\r\nprocess, passing through a fascia channel, striking the trachea and\r\nexiting through the lower anterior of the neck?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What substance did you prepare to simulate that portion of\r\nthe President's body?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We determined the distance on various people by locating\r\nthis anatomical region and using people of various sizes we found that\r\nregardless of general body build, the distance penetrated was around\r\n13-1/2 to 14-1/2 cm.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, I used gelatin blocks 20 percent gelatin cut at\r\n13-1/2 cm. lengths and also used horsemeat and goatmeat placed in a\r\nbox so that--this was a little harder to get the exact length but that\r\nvaried between 13-1/2 and 14-1/2 cm. of muscle tissue.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that simulate, then, the portion of the President's\r\nbody through which the bullet is reported to have passed, as closely as\r\nyou could for your testing purposes?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. As closely as we could for these test purposes; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 847 and ask you to testify as to what that depicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a box containing--I couldn't say looking at\r\nit whether it is the horsemeat or the goatmeat but one of the two.\r\nThe distance traveled through that meat would be 13-1/2 to 14-1/2\r\ncentimeters. It is also covered with clothing and clipped goatskin\r\non the entrance and exit sides, and behind that are the screens for\r\nmeasuring the exit velocity. We had already determined the striking\r\nvelocity by firing I believe it was--I have it right here if you\r\nwant----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you proceed to that, describe the type of screens\r\nwhich are shown in the picture which were used to measure exit\r\nvelocity, if you please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes. These screens are known as the break-type screen.\r\nThey are silver imprinted on paper and when the bullet passes through\r\nit breaks the current. When it passes through the first screen it\r\nbreaks the current activating a chronograph, counting chronograph. When\r\nit passes through the second screen it stops. This is over a known\r\ndistance, and so the time that it took to pass between the first and\r\nthe second will give you the average velocity halfway between the two\r\nscreens.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 848\r\nand ask you to describe what that shows?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This was a similar setup used for firing through gelatin.\r\nIt had clothing and skin over the entrance side only. If it had been\r\nplaced on the other side it would have just flown off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that is similar to that depicted in 846?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Essentially; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Except that it is----\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Gelatin instead of the tissues.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now at what range was the firing performed on the gelatin,\r\ngoatmeat and horsemeat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This firing was done at a 60-yard range.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what gun was used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano that was marked Commission\r\nExhibit 139.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what bullets were used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The Western ammunition lot 6,000, 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there any substance placed over the gelatin,\r\nhorsemeat and goatmeat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; over the gelatin we had clothing; had a suit, shirt\r\nand undershirt, and underneath that a clipped goatskin. The same thing\r\nwas over the meat, and on the other side of the meat was also clipped\r\ngoatskin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would there be any significant difference to the test by\r\nleaving out the undershirt if the President had not worn an undershirt?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the circumstance was simulated with the actual\r\ntype clothing and a protective skin over the substance just as\r\nrealistically as you could make it?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What measurement was obtained as to the entrance velocity\r\nof the bullet at the distance of 60 yards which you described?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The striking velocity at an average of three shots was\r\n1,904 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the average exit velocity on each of the\r\nsubstances used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. For the gelatin the average exit velocity was 1,779 feet\r\nper second. The horsemeat, the average exit velocity was 1,798 feet\r\nper second. And the goatmeat the average exit velocity was 1,772 feet\r\nper second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 849\r\nand ask you what that picture represents?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is one of the gelatin blocks used in that test. It\r\nshows the type of track left by the bullet passing through it. That\r\nbullet is very stable. Passing through the body and muscle, it would\r\nmake a similar type wound. Of course, you couldn't observe it that\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe that as being a straight line?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a picture marked Commission Exhibit No. 850\r\nand ask you what that represents?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. These are pieces of clipped goatskin, clipped very\r\nshortly. There is still some hair on it. These were placed, these\r\nparticular ones were placed over the tissues. This would be placed over\r\nthe entrance side of the animal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"this,\" you are referring to a piece of\r\ngoatskin which is marked \"enter\"?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Marked \"enter.\" The one marked \"exit\" was placed on the far\r\nside of the tissues and the bullet passed through that after it came\r\nout of the tissues.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the record, will you describe the characteristics,\r\nwhich are shown on the goatskin at the point of entry, please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. At the point of entry the wound holes through the skin\r\nare for all purposes round. On the exit side they are more elongated,\r\ntwo of them in particular are a little more elongated. The bullet had\r\nstarted to become slightly unstable coming out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about the third or lower bullet on the skin\r\ndesignated exit?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. That hole appears as more stable than the other two. In\r\nall three cases the bullet is still pretty stable. The gelatin blocks,\r\nthere were gelatin blocks placed behind these things too, and for all\r\npractical purposes, the tracks through them still indicated a stable\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other conclusions which you would care to\r\nadd to those which you have already indicated, resulting from the tests\r\nyou have heretofore described?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Well, it means that the bullet that passed through the\r\nPresident's neck had lost very little of its wounding potential and\r\nwas capable of doing a great deal of damage in penetrating. I might\r\nmention one thing showing how great its penetrating ability was. That\r\nsay on one of the gelatin shots, it went through a total, counting the\r\ngelatin block, it went through plus the backing up blocks of gelatin,\r\nit went through a total of 72-1/2 centimeters of gelatin, was still\r\ntraveling and buried itself in a mound of earth so it has terrific\r\npenetrating ability. This means that had the bullet that passed through\r\nthe President's neck hit in the car or anywhere you would have seen\r\nevidence, a good deal of evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Olivier, in the regular course of your work for the\r\nU.S. Army, do you have occasion to perform tests on animal materials\r\nwhere the characteristics of those animals materials are sufficiently\r\nsimilar to human bodies to make a determination of the effect of the\r\nbullet wounds in human bodies?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have occasion to make a test on goat material\r\nin connection with the experiments which you ran?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you familiar with the wounds inflicted on Governor\r\nConnally on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; from reading the surgeon's report and also from\r\ntalking to Dr. Gregory and Dr. Shaw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have access to the medical reports of Parkland\r\nHospital concerning the wounds of Governor Connally in all respects?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have occasion to discuss those wounds in\r\ngreat detail with Dr. Shaw and Dr. Gregory when they were present in\r\nWashington, D.C. on April 21, 1964, preparatory to their testifying\r\nbefore this Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the nature of the wound on Governor Connally's\r\nback?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The surgeon's report described it as about 3 centimeters\r\nlong, its longest dimension, and it is hard for me to remember reading\r\nit or discussing it with him but I did both. Apparently it was a jagged\r\nwound. He said a wound like this consists of two things, usually a\r\ndefect in the epidermis and a central hole which is small, and he could\r\nput his finger in it so it was a fairly large wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the path of the bullet in a general way, based on\r\nthe information provided to you concerning Governor Connally's wound in\r\nthe back?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Apparently it passed along the rib. I don't recall which\r\nrib it was but passed the fifth rib, passed along this rib causing a\r\nfracture that I believe removed about 10 centimeters of the rib through\r\nfragments through the pleura, lacerating the lung. I asked Dr. Shaw\r\ndirectly whether he thought the bullet had gone through the pleural\r\ncavity and he said he didn't believe that it had, that the damage was\r\ndone by the rib fragments. Then the bullet exited as described somewhat\r\nbelow the right nipple.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you perform a test on goat substance to endeavor to\r\nmeasure the reduction in velocity of a missile similar to the one which\r\npassed through Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why was goat substance selected for that purpose in the\r\ntesting procedure?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We usually use this in our work so we are familiar with\r\nit. I am not saying it is the only substance that could be used, but we\r\nwere not using any unknown procedures or any procedures that we hadn't\r\nused already.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does it closely simulate the nature of a wound in the\r\nhuman body?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In this particular instance it did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the wound inflicted on the goat, then, subjected to\r\nX-ray analysis for the purpose of determining the precise nature of the\r\nwound and for comparison purposes with that wound----\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Inflicted on Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you an X-ray marked Commission Exhibit 851 and\r\nask you to state what that shows?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It shows a fractured rib. From this you wouldn't be able\r\nto--well, if you were a better radiologist than I was, you might be\r\nable to tell which one, but it was the eighth left rib. It shows a\r\ncomminuted fracture extending some distance along the rib.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 852, which is a\r\nphotograph, and ask you to testify as to what that depicts, please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a photograph taken from the same X-ray again\r\nshowing the comminuted fracture of the eighth left rib.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a photograph then of the X-ray designated\r\nCommission Exhibit 851?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to observe personally the\r\nX-rays showing the wound on Governor Connally's rib?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how do those X-rays compare with the wound inflicted\r\nas depicted in Exhibits 851 and 852?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. They are very similar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When the wounds were inflicted, as depicted in 851 and\r\n852, what weapon was used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This was again the 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what bullets were used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The 6.5 millimeter Western ammunition lot 6,000.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what distance was utilized?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. On the goat the distance was 70 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there any covering over the goat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes. There was a suit, shirt, and undershirt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the entrance velocity of the bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Striking velocity for an average of 11 shots was 1,929\r\nfeet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the exit velocity?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The exit velocity was 1,664 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a box containing a bullet, which has been\r\nmarked as Commission Exhibit No. 853, and ask you if you have ever seen\r\nthat bullet before?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And under what circumstances have you previously seen that\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This was the bullet that was fired through the goat. It\r\nwent through the velocity screens into some cotton waste, dropped out\r\nof the bottom of that and was lying on the floor. It was picked up\r\nimmediately afterwards still warm, so we knew it was the bullet that\r\nhad fired that particular shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that fired through the goat depicted in the\r\nphotographs and X-ray, 851 and 852?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; that was the goat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe for the record, verbally please, the\r\ncharacteristics of that bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The bullet has been quite flattened. The lead core is\r\nextruding somewhat from the rear. We weighed the bullet. It weighs\r\n158.8 grains.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Commission Exhibit 399, which has been\r\nheretofore in Commission proceedings identified as the bullet found\r\non the stretcher of Governor Connally, and ask if you have had an\r\nopportunity to compare 399 with 853?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you find on that comparison?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The bullet recovered on the stretcher has not been\r\nflattened as much, but there is a suggestion of flattening there from\r\na somewhat similar occurrence. Also, the lead core has extruded from\r\nthe rear in the same fashion, and it appears that some of it has even\r\nbroken from the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there some flattening on both of those bullets in\r\napproximately the same areas toward the rear of the missiles?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In the bullet, our particular bullet is flattened the\r\nwhole length, but you say towards the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say our bullet; you mean 853?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, 853 is flattened. No. 399 is flattened more towards\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other conclusions which you have to add to\r\nthe tests performed on the goat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Well, again in this test it demonstrates that the bullet\r\nthat was stable when it struck in this fashion again lost very little\r\nvelocity in going through that much goat tissue.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the amount of goat tissue it traversed was probably\r\nsomewhat less than the Governor, but in any case it indicates the\r\nbullet would have had a lot of remaining velocity and could have done a\r\nlot of damage.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that hasn't been brought up is the velocity screen\r\nimmediately behind the goat, the imprint of the bullet left on it was\r\nalmost the length of the bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What does that indicate?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This indicates that the bullet was now no longer traveling\r\nstraight but either traveling sideways or tumbling end over end at the\r\ntime it hit the screen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that was after the point of exit from the goat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other conclusions which you found from the\r\nstudies on the goat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No, I believe that is all I can think of right at this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the regular course of your work for the U.S. Army,\r\ndo you have occasion to perform tests on parts of human cadavers to\r\ndetermine the effects of bullets on human beings?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was a series of tests performed under your supervision\r\non the portions of human cadavers simulated to the wound inflicted on\r\nthe wrist of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you familiar with the nature of the wound on Governor\r\nConnally's wrist prior to performing those tests?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the source of your information on those wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I had read the surgeon's report, also talked with Dr.\r\nGregory, the surgeon who had done the surgery, and had looked at the\r\nX-rays.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you had an opportunity to discuss the wounds with Dr.\r\nGregory and view the X-rays taken at Parkland Hospital, here in the\r\nCommission headquarters?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On April 21, 1964?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you an X-ray marked as Commission Exhibit 854,\r\nand ask you what that depicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a comminuted fracture of the distal end of the\r\nradius of a human arm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in what manner was that wound caused?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It was caused by a bullet from the Commission Exhibit 139.\r\nThis was again the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano Western ammunition\r\nlot 6,000.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fired at what distance?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Fired at a distance of 70 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there anything protecting the wrist at the time of\r\nimpact?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Not protection but there was again clothing, this time\r\nsuit material or suit lining, at least suit material and shirt. I am\r\nnot sure about the lining. I can tell you. I have it right here. Suit\r\nmaterial, suit lining material, and shirt material.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked as Commission Exhibit\r\n855 and ask you what that represents?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a photograph taken from the X-ray, Commission\r\nExhibit 854.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe for the record the details of the\r\ninjuries shown on 854 and 855, please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is a comminuted fracture of the distal end of the\r\nradius. It was struck directly by the bullet. It passed through, not\r\ndirectly through but through at an oblique angle so that it entered\r\nmore proximal on the dorsal side of the wrist and distal on the volar\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does the entry and exit compare with the wound on\r\nGovernor Connally which you observed on the X-rays?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In this particular instance to the best of my memory from\r\nlooking at the X-rays, it is very close. It is about one of the best\r\nones that we obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any definable difference at all?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I couldn't determine any.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It is close, you say?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes. If I had both X-rays in front of me if there was a\r\ndifference I could determine it, but from memory I would say it was for\r\nall purposes identical.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a bullet in a case marked Commission\r\nExhibit 856 and ask if you have ever seen that before?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes. This is the bullet that caused the damage shown in\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 854 and 855.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe that bullet for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The nose of the bullet is quite flattened from striking\r\nthe radius.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does it compare, for example, with Commission Exhibit\r\n399?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It is not like it at all. I mean, Commission Exhibit 399\r\nis not flattened on the end. This one is very severely flattened on the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the velocity of the missile at the time it struck\r\nthe wrist depicted in 854 and 855?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The average striking velocity was 1,858 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have the precise striking velocity of that one?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No; I don't. We could not put velocity screen in front of\r\nthe individual shots because it would have interfered with the gunner's\r\nview. So we took five shots and got an average striking velocity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say five shots with an average striking velocity,\r\nthose were at the delineated distance without striking anything on\r\nthose particular shots?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Right, and after establishing that velocity, then we went\r\non to shoot the various arms.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the exit velocity?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. On this particular one?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you have it?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes. Well, I don't know if I have that or not. We didn't\r\nget them in all because some of these things deflect. No, I have no\r\nexit velocity on this particular one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What exit velocity did you get on the average?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Average exit velocity was 1,776 feet per second. This was\r\nfor an average of seven. We did 10. We obtained velocity on seven.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the average reduction be approximately the same,\r\nin your professional opinion, as to the bullet exiting from the wrist\r\ndepicted in 854 and 855?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Somewhat. Let me give you the extremes of our velocities.\r\nThe highest one was 1,866 and the lowest was 1,664, so there was a\r\n202-feet-per-second difference in the thing. Some of the cases bone was\r\nmissed, in other cases glancing blows. But I would say it is a close\r\napproximation to what the exit velocity was on that particular one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what would the close approximation be, the average?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The average.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you compare the damage, which was done to Governor\r\nConnally's wrist, as contrasted with the damage to the wrist depicted\r\nin 854 and 855?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The damage in the wrist that you see in the X-ray on 854\r\nand 855, the damage is greater than was done to the Governor's wrist.\r\nThere is more severe comminution here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much more severe is the comminution?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Considerably more. If I remember correctly in the\r\nX-rays of the Governor's wrist, I think there were only two or three\r\nfragments, if that many. Here we have many, many small fragments.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In your opinion, based on the tests which you have\r\nperformed, was the damage inflicted on Governor Connally's wrist caused\r\nby a pristine bullet, a bullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle\r\n6.5 missile which did not hit anything before it struck the Governor's\r\nwrist?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I don't believe so. I don't believe his wrist was struck\r\nby a pristine bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the reason for your conclusion on that?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In this case I go by the size of the entrance wound and\r\nexit wound on the Governor's wrist. The entrance wound was on the\r\ndorsal surface, it was described by the surgeon as being much larger\r\nthan the exit wound. He said he almost overlooked that on the volar\r\naspect of the wrist.\r\n\r\nIn every instance we had a larger exit wound than an entrance wound\r\nfiring with a pristine bullet apparently at the same angle at which it\r\nentered and exited the Governor's wrist.\r\n\r\nAlso, and I don't believe they were mixed up on which was entrance and\r\nexit. For one thing the clothing, you know, the surgeon found pieces\r\nof clothing and the other thing the human anatomy is such that I don't\r\nbelieve it would enter through the volar aspect and out the top.\r\n\r\nSo I am pretty sure that the Governor's wrist was not hit by a pristine\r\nor a stable bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is there, in and of the nature of the smaller wound\r\nof exit and larger wound of entrance in the Governor's wrist as\r\ncontrasted with a smaller wound of entrance and larger wound of exit in\r\n854 and 855, which leads you to conclude that the Governor's wrist was\r\nnot struck by a pristine bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Do you want to repeat that question again?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is there about the wound of entry or exit which led\r\nyou to think that the Governor's wrist wasn't struck by a pristine\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Well, he would have had a larger exit wound than entrance\r\nwound, which he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And if the velocity of the missile is decreased, how does\r\nthat effect the nature of the wounds of entry and exit?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. If the velocity is decreased, if the bullet is still\r\nstable, he still should have a larger exit wound than an entrance.\r\n\r\nNow, on the other hand, to get a larger entrance wound and a smaller\r\nexit wound, this indicates the bullet probably hit with very much of a\r\nyaw. I mean, as this hole appeared in the velocity screen the bullet\r\neither tumbling or striking sideways, this would have made a larger\r\nentrance wound, lose considerable of its velocity in fracturing the\r\nbone, and coming out at a very low velocity, made a smaller hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So the crucial factor would be the analysis that the\r\nbullet was characterized with yaw at the time it struck?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Causing a larger wound of entry and a smaller wound of\r\nexit?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now is there anything in the----\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Also at a reduced velocity because if it struck at\r\nconsiderable yaw at a high velocity as it could do if it hit something\r\nand deflected, it would have, it could make a larger wound of exit but\r\nit would have been even a more severe wound than we had here. It would\r\nhave been very severe, could even amputate the wrist hitting at high\r\nvelocity sideways. We have to say this bullet was characterized by an\r\nextreme amount of yaw and reduced velocity. How much reduced, I don't\r\nknow, but considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the greater damage, inflicted on the wrist in 854 and\r\n855 than that which was inflicted on Governor Connally's wrist, have\r\nany value as indicating whether Governor Connally's wrist was struck by\r\na pristine bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No; because holding the velocity the same or similar the\r\ndamage would be greater with a tumbling bullet than a pristine.\r\n\r\nI think it reflects both instability and reduced velocity. You have\r\nto show the two. I mean, the size of the entrance and exit are very\r\nimportant. This shows that the thing was used when it struck. The\r\nfact that there was no more damage than was done by a tumbling bullet\r\nindicates the bullet at a reduced velocity. You have to put these two\r\nthings together.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had Governor Connally's wrist been struck with a pristine\r\nbullet without yaw, would more damage have been inflicted----\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Than was inflicted on the Governor's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So then the lesser damage on the Governor's wrist in and\r\nof itself indicates in your opinion----\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. That it wasn't struck by a pristine bullet; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other conclusions which flow from the\r\nexperiments which you conducted on the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We concluded that it wasn't struck by a pristine bullet.\r\nAlso drew the conclusion that it was struck by an unstable bullet, a\r\nbullet at a much reduced velocity. The question that it brings up\r\nin my mind is if the same bullet that struck the wrist had passed\r\nthrough the Governor's chest, if the bullet that struck the Governor's\r\nchest had not hit anything else would it have been reduced low enough\r\nto do this, and I wonder, based on our work--it brings to mind the\r\npossibility the same bullet that struck the President striking the\r\nGovernor would account for this more readily. I don't know, I don't\r\nthink you can ever say this, but it is a very good possibility, I think\r\nmore possible, more probable than not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What is more probable than not, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. In my mind at least, and I don't know the angles at which\r\nthe things went or anything, it seems to me more probable that the\r\nbullet that hit the Governor's chest had already been slowed down\r\nsomewhat, in order to lose enough velocity to strike his wrist and do\r\nno more damage than it did. I don't know how you would ever determine\r\nit exactly. I think the best approach is to find out the angles of\r\nflight, whether it is possible. But I have a feeling that it might have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It might have been?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The one that went through his chest went through his hand\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; and also through the President.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The first shot?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Well, I don't know whether the first or second. The first\r\none could have missed. It could have been the second that hit both.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The one that went through his back and came out his\r\ntrachea?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It could have hit the Governor in the chest and went\r\nthrough because it had so little velocity after coming out of the wrist\r\nthat it barely penetrated the thigh.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May I ask one more question? Would you think, that the\r\nsame bullet could have done all three of those things?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. That same bullet was capable.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gone through the President's back as it did, gone through\r\nGovernor Connally's chest as it did, and then through his hand as it\r\ndid?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It was certainly capable of doing all that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It was capable?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The one shot?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Olivier, based on the descriptions of the wound on\r\nthe Governor's back, what in your opinion was the characteristic of the\r\nbullet at the time it struck the Governor's back with respect to the\r\ncourse of its flight?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Let's say from the size of the wound as described by the\r\nsurgeon, it could have been tipped somewhat when it struck because that\r\nis a fairly large wound. Another thing that could have done it is the\r\nangle at which it hit. On the goat some of the wounds were larger than\r\nothers. On the goat material some of the wounds were larger than others\r\nbecause of the angle at which it hit this material. The same thing\r\ncould happen on the Governor's back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how was that wound described with respect to its size?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The Governor's wound?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the Governor's back?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. About 3 centimeters at its largest dimension.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you have any view as to which factor was more\r\nprobable, as to whether it was a tangential strike on the Governor's\r\nback, or whether there was yaw in the bullet at the time it struck the\r\nGovernor's back?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I couldn't as far as being tangential. I couldn't answer\r\nthat, not knowing the position of the Governor. But it could have been\r\ncaused by a bullet yawing. I mean it would have made a larger wound, as\r\nthat was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other cause which could account for that type\r\nof a large wound on the Governor's back other than with the bullet\r\nyawing?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. With this particular bullet those would be the two\r\nprobable causes of this wound of this size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And those two probable causes are what?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. One, the bullet hitting not perpendicular to the surface\r\nof the Governor, in other words, hitting tangential at a slight angle\r\non his back so that it came in cutting the skin. Another, the bullet\r\nhitting that wasn't perpendicular to the surface as it hit. The bullet\r\ndid go along, the surgeon described the path as tangential but he is\r\nspeaking of along the rib. It isn't clear it was, as it struck, whether\r\nit was a tangential shot or actually perpendicular to the Governor's\r\nback.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to add one additional factor which Dr. Shaw\r\ntestified to during the course of the proceeding after he measured the\r\nangle of decline through the Governor; and Dr. Shaw testified that\r\nthere was a 25° to 27° angle of declination measuring from front to\r\nback on the Governor, taking into account the position of the wound on\r\nthe Governor's back and the position of the wound on the Governor's\r\nchest below the right nipple.\r\n\r\nNow with that factor, added to those which you already know, would\r\nthat enable you to form a conclusion as to whether the nature of the\r\nwound on the Governor's back was caused by yaw of the bullet or by a\r\ntangential strike?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I don't think I would want to say. If I could have seen\r\nthe Governor's wound, this would have been a help.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the damage done to the Governor's wrist indicate\r\nthat a bullet which was fired approximately 160 to 250 feet away with\r\nthe muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per second, would it\r\nindicate that the bullet was slowed up only by the passage through the\r\nGovernor's body, in the way which you know, or would it indicate that\r\nthere was some other factor which slowed up the bullet in addition?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It would indicate there was some other factor that had\r\nslowed up the bullet in addition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your reason for that conclusion, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The amount of damage alone; striking that end it would have\r\ncaused more severe comminution as we found. You know--if it hadn't been\r\nslowed up in some other fashion. At that range it still had a striking\r\nvelocity of 1,858 or in the vicinity of 1,800 feet per second, which is\r\ncapable of doing more damage than was done to the Governor's wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the same bullet which passed through the President, in\r\nthe way heretofore described for the record, then struck the Governor\r\nas well, what effect would there have been in reducing its velocity as\r\na result of that course?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. You say the bullet first struck the President. In coming\r\nout of the President's body it would have had a tendency to be slightly\r\nunstable. In striking the Governor it would have lost more velocity in\r\nhis chest than if it had been a pristine bullet striking the Governor's\r\nchest, so it would have exited from the Governor's chest I would say\r\nat a considerably reduced velocity, probably with a good amount of yaw\r\nor tumbling, and this would account for the type of wound that the\r\nGovernor did have in his wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The approximate reduction in velocity on passage through\r\nthe goat was what, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The average velocity loss in the seven cases we did was 82\r\nfeet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If the bullet had passed through the President prior to\r\nthe time it passed through the Governor, would you expect a larger loss\r\nthan 82 feet per second resulting from the passage through the body of\r\nthe Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I am not sure if I heard you correctly. This is if it hit\r\nthe Governor without hitting the President or hitting the President\r\nfirst?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me rephrase it for you, Dr. Olivier.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; please.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You testified that the bullet lost 82 feet per second when\r\nit passed through the goat.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now what would your expectations be as to the reduction in\r\nvelocity on a bullet which passed through the Governor, assuming that\r\nit struck nothing first?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It would be greater; the distance through the Governor's\r\nchest would have been greater.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that be an appreciable or approximately the same?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Can I bring in any other figures? Dr. Dziemian has\r\ncomputed approximately what he thought it would have lost.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, of course, if you have any other figure which would\r\nbe helpful.\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I believe you misunderstood Mr. Specter. I think you\r\ngave the figure for the loss of velocity through the Governor's wrist\r\ninstead of through his chest.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I am sorry. We were on the wrist; okay.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me start again then. In an effort to draw some\r\nconclusion about the reduction in velocity through the Governor's\r\nchest, I am now going back and asking you what was the reduction in\r\nvelocity of the bullet which passed through the goat?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did misunderstand you. I am sorry. The loss in\r\nvelocity passing through the goat was 265 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would that be the approximate loss in velocity of a\r\npristine bullet passing through the Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The loss would be somewhat greater.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much greater in your opinion?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Do you have that figure, Dr. Dziemian?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I would say a pristine bullet of the Governor was about\r\nhalf again thicker. It would be about half again as great velocity,\r\nsomewhere around 400.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the bullet passed through only the Governor, losing\r\nvelocity of 400 feet per second, would you have expected that the\r\ndamage inflicted on the Governor's wrist would have been about the same\r\nas that inflicted on Governor Connally or greater?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. My feeling is it would have been greater.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the bullet passed through the President and then\r\nstruck Governor Connally, would it have lost velocity of 400 feet per\r\nsecond in passing through Governor Connally or more?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It would have lost more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the reason for that?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The bullet after passing through, say a dense medium, then\r\nthrough air and then through another dense medium tends to be more\r\nunstable, based on our past work. It appears to be that it would have\r\ntumbled more readily and lost energy more rapidly. How much velocity it\r\nwould have lost, I couldn't say, but it would have lost more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any indications from the internal wounds on\r\nGovernor Connally as to whether or not the bullet which entered his\r\nbody was an unstable bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The only thing that might give you an indication would be\r\nthe skin wound of entrance, the type of rib fracture and all that I\r\nthink could be accounted for by either type, because in our experiment\r\nwe simulated, although not to as great a degree, the damage wasn't as\r\nsevere, but I think it would be hard to say that.\r\n\r\nOne thing comes to my mind right now that might indicate it. There was\r\na greater flattening of the bullet in our experiments than there was\r\ngoing through the Governor, which might indicate that it struck the rib\r\nwhich did the flattening at a lower velocity. This is only a thought.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It struck the rib of the Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It struck the rib of the Governor at a lower velocity\r\nbecause that bullet was less flattened than the bullet through the goat\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the nature of the wound inflicted on the\r\nGovernor's wrist, and on the tests which you have conducted then, do\r\nyou have an opinion as to which is more probable on whether the bullet\r\npassed through only the Governor's chest before striking his wrist, or\r\npassed through the President first and then the Governor's chest before\r\nstriking the Governor's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Will you say that again to make sure I have it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. [To the reporter.] Could you repeat that question, please?\r\n\r\n(The question was read by the reporter.)\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. You couldn't say exactly at all. My feeling is that it\r\nwould be more probable that it passed through the President first. At\r\nleast I think it is important to establish line of flight to try to\r\ndetermine it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from the lines of flight, based on the factors which\r\nwere known to you from the medical point of view and from the tests\r\nwhich you conducted, what would be the reason for the feeling which you\r\njust expressed?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Because I believe you would need that, I mean to account\r\nfor the damage to the wrist. I don't think you would have gotten a low\r\nenough velocity upon reaching the wrist unless you had gone through the\r\nPresident's body first.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The President's body as well as the Governor's body?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. As well as the Governor's.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the nature of the wound which was inflicted on\r\nGovernor Connally's thigh shed any light on this subject?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This, to my mind, at least, merely indicates the bullet\r\nat this time was about spent. In talking with doctor, I believe it was\r\nGregory, I don't think he did the operation on the thigh but at least\r\nhe saw the wound, and he said it was about the size of an eraser on a\r\nlead pencil. This could be accounted for--and there was also this small\r\nfragment of bullet in this thigh wound--this, to me, indicates that\r\nthis was a spent bullet that had gone through the wrist as the Governor\r\nwas sitting there, went through the wrist into his thigh, just partly\r\nimbedded and then fell out and I believe this was the bullet that was\r\nfound on the stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have any opinion as to the velocity of that\r\nbullet at the time it struck the Governor's thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No. We didn't do any work to simulate this, but it would\r\nhave been at a very low velocity just to have gone in that far and drop\r\nout again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Olivier, in the regular course of your work for the\r\nU.S. Army, do you have occasion to perform tests on reconstructed human\r\nskulls to determine the effects of bullets on skulls?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have occasion to conduct such a test in\r\nconnection with the series which you are now describing?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline briefly the procedures for\r\nsimulating the human skull?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Human skulls, we take these human skulls and they are\r\nimbedded and filled with 20 percent gelatin. As I mentioned before, 20\r\npercent gelatin is a pretty good simulant for body tissues.\r\n\r\nThey are in the moisture content. When I say 20 percent, it is 20\r\npercent weight of the dry gelatin, 80 percent moisture.\r\n\r\nThe skull, the cranial cavity, is filled with this and the surface is\r\ncoated with a gelatin and then it is trimmed down to approximate the\r\nthickness of the tissues overlying the skull, the soft tissues of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what distance were these tests performed?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. These tests were performed at a distance of 90 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what gun was used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It was a 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano that was marked Commission\r\nExhibit 139.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What bullets were used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It was the 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano Western\r\nammunition lot 6,000.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did that examination or test, rather, disclose?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the\r\nPresident received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised\r\nme very much, because this type of a stable bullet I didn't think\r\nwould cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go through making\r\na small entrance and exit, but the bones of the skull are enough to\r\ndeform the end of this bullet causing it to expend a lot of energy and\r\nblowing out the side of the skull or blowing out fragments of the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a case containing bullet fragments marked\r\nCommission Exhibit 857 and ask if you have ever seen those fragments\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And under what circumstances have you viewed those before,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. There were, the two larger fragments were recovered\r\noutside of the skull in the cotton waste we were using to catch the\r\nfragments without deforming them. There are some smaller fragments in\r\nhere that were obtained from the gelatin within the cranial cavity\r\nafter the experiment. We melted the gelatin out and recovered the\r\nsmallest fragments from within the cranial cavity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I show you two fragments designated as Commission\r\nExhibits 567 and 579 heretofore identified as having been found on the\r\nfront seat of the President's car on November 22, 1963, and ask you if\r\nyou have had an opportunity to examine those before.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to compare those to the\r\ntwo fragments identified as Commission Exhibit 857?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did that comparison show?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. They are quite similar. These two fragments on, what is\r\nthe number?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. 857.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. On 857 there isn't as much of the front part in this one,\r\nbut in other respects they are very similar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 858\r\nand ask you what that depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I see that other exhibit?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. These are the same fragments as marked 857.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is a photograph of the fragments marked 857?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. 857.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 859\r\nand ask you what that depicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. These are the smaller fragments that have been labeled,\r\nalso, Exhibit 857. This picture or some of the fragments labeled 857,\r\nthese are the smaller fragments contained in the same box.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are all of the fragments on 859 contained within 857?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. They are supposed to be, photographed and placed in the\r\nbox. If they dropped out they are supposed to be all there.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what point on the skull did the bullet, which\r\nfragmented into Commission Exhibit 857, strike?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I would have to see the picture. I mean I can't remember\r\nexactly what point. I can tell you the point we were aiming at and\r\napproximately where it hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to make available a photograph to you, then, for\r\npurposes of refreshing your recollection, and in testifying as to the\r\npoint which was struck, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. We did 10 skulls so I can't remember offhand where\r\neveryone struck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For that purpose I hand you Commission Exhibit 860 and ask\r\nyou if that is designated in any way to identify it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is the test we are talking about now, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir; where the bullet fragmented into pieces in 857.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are you introducing that into evidence?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you already introduced it in the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May I at this point move for the admission into evidence\r\nof Commission Exhibits 844 through 860, and they have been identified\r\nin sequence as being the photographs, X-rays, and other tangible\r\nexhibits used in connection with these tests.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 844 through 860 were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This photograph is the skull that was shot with the\r\nbullet, the fragments which are marked 857.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what point on the skull did the bullet strike?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. From this I couldn't tell you exactly the point. We were\r\naiming, as described in the autopsy report if I remember correctly the\r\npoint 2 centimeters to the right of the external occipital protuberance\r\nand slightly above it. We placed a mark on the skull at that point,\r\naccording to the autopsy the bullet emerged through the superorbital\r\nprocess, so we drew a line to give us the line of flight, put unclipped\r\ngoat hair over the back to simulate the scalp and put a mark on the\r\narea which we wished to shoot.\r\n\r\nNow, every shot didn't strike exactly where we wanted, but they all\r\nstruck in the back of the skull in the vicinity of our aiming point,\r\nsome maybe slightly above the external occipital protuberance. In some\r\ncases very close to our aiming spot.\r\n\r\nThis particular skull blew out the right side in a manner very similar\r\nto the wounds of the President, and if I remember correctly, it was\r\nvery close to the point at which we aimed.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a couple centimeters to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any record which would be more specific on the\r\npoint of entrance?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Our notebook has all----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you refer to your notes, then?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The notebook is in the safe in there in the briefcase.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you get the notebook and refer to it so we can be as\r\nspecific as possible on this point.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I have the location of that wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you give us then the precise location of the wound\r\ncaused by bullet identified as 857?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The entrance wound is 2.9 centimeters to the right and\r\nalmost horizontal to the occipital protuberance. This is almost exactly\r\nwhere we were aiming. We were aiming 2 centimeters to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked as Commission Exhibit\r\n861, move its admission into evidence, and ask you to state what that\r\ndepicts.\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is the skull in question, the same one from which the\r\nfragments marked Exhibit 857 were recovered.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what does that show as to damage done to the skull?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It blew the whole side of the cranial cavity away.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does that compare, then, with the damage inflicted on\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Very similar. I think they stated the length of the\r\ndefect, the missing skull was 13 centimeters if I remember correctly.\r\nThis in this case it is greater, but you don't have the limiting scalp\r\nholding the pieces in so you would expect it to fly a little more but\r\nit is essentially a similar type wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the human scalp work to hold in the human skull in\r\nsuch circumstances to a greater extent than the simulated matters used?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes; we take this into account.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you Commission Exhibit 862, move its admission into\r\nevidence, and ask you what that depicts?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. This is the same skull. This is just looking at it\r\nfrom the front. You are looking at the exit. You can't see it here\r\nbecause the bone has been blown away, but the bullet exited somewhere\r\naround--we reconstructed the skull. In other words, it exited very\r\nclose to the superorbital ridge, possibly below it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you formulate any other conclusions or opinions based\r\non the tests on firing at the skull?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Well, let's see. We found that this bullet could do\r\nexactly--could make the type of wound that the President received.\r\n\r\nAlso, that the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones\r\nrecovered on the front seat and on the floor of the car.\r\n\r\nThis, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the bullet\r\nthat wounded the President in the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how do the two major fragments in 857 compare, then,\r\nwith the fragments heretofore identified as 567 and 569?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. They are quite similar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an opinion as to whether the wound on the\r\nGovernor's wrist could have been caused by a fragment of a bullet\r\ncoming off of the President's head?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I don't believe so. Frankly, I don't know, but I don't\r\nbelieve so, because it expended so much energy in blowing the head\r\napart and took a lot of energy that I doubt if they could have\r\nfractured the radius. The radius is a very strong, hard bone and I\r\ndon't believe they could have done that much damage. I believe they\r\ncould have caused a superficial laceration on someone or a mark on the\r\nwindshield, but I don't believe they could have done that damage to the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And it couldn't have then gone through the wrist into the\r\nthigh?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had an opportunity to examine a fragment\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit 842 which is the fragment taken from\r\nGovernor Connally's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could that fragment have come from the bullet designated\r\nas Commission Exhibit 399?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, I believe it would have, I will add further I believe\r\nit could have because the core of the bullet extrudes through the back\r\nand would allow part of it to break off very readily.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an opinion as to whether, in fact, bullet\r\n399 did cause the wound on the Governor's wrist, assuming if you will\r\nthat it was the missile found on the Governor's stretcher at Parkland\r\nHospital?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. I believe that it was. That is my feeling.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To be certain that the record is complete on the skull\r\ntests, would you again state the distance at which those tests were\r\nperformed?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Yes, the skulls--it was fired at the skulls at a range of\r\n90 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With what gun?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The 6.5 mm. Carcano which was marked Commission Exhibit\r\n139 and using Western ammunition lot 6,000, again the 6.5 mm.\r\nMannlicher-Carcano.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going to the results of the test on the cadavers, what was\r\nthe average exit velocity?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. The average exit velocity on the wrist was 1,776 feet per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had Governor Connally's wrist been struck with a pristine\r\nbullet and the bullet exited at that speed, what damage would have been\r\ninflicted had it then struck the area of the thigh which was struck on\r\nthe Governor according to the Parkland Hospital records which you have\r\nsaid you have examined?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. It would have made a very severe wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it have been more severe than the one which was\r\ninflicted?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. Much more so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add, Dr. Olivier, which you think\r\nwould be helpful to the Commission in any way?\r\n\r\nDr. OLIVIER. No; I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That completes my questions, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much. We appreciate very much your coming.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ARTHUR J. DZIEMIAN\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Dziemian.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Doctor, will you raise your right hand, please? Do you\r\nsolemnly swear the testimony you give in this proceeding is the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Dziemian, as you know, the purpose of the proceeding\r\nis to question you concerning the experiments which were performed at\r\nEdgewood Arsenal which may shed light on the assassination of President\r\nKennedy. With that brief statement of purpose, will you state your full\r\nname for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Arthur J. Dziemian.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession or occupation, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I am a physiologist at the U.S. Army Chemical Research\r\nand Development Laboratories, and am chief of the Biophysics Division.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline your educational background briefly,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; A.B. and Ph. D. from Princeton, Ph. D. in 1939. I\r\nwas national research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania in the\r\nphysiology department of the medical school and fellow in anatomy at\r\nJohns Hopkins University Medical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In a general way, what have your professional activities\r\nbeen since 1939?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Since 1939?\r\n\r\nWell, these fellowships that I had. Then I went to Edgewood Arsenal,\r\nwas there for a few months and then went into the Army, was in the Army\r\nfor 3 years, in the sanitary corps, officer in the sanitary corps, and\r\nthen I returned to Edgewood Arsenal in 1947 and in 1947 I went into\r\nwound ballistics work and have been in it since 1947.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been chief of the Biophysics\r\nDivision?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Since November of 1959.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is this Biophysics Division?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. U.S. Army Chemical Research and Development Laboratories,\r\nEdgewood Arsenal, Md.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe in a general way the tests which are\r\nperformed at the Edgewood Arsenal, please?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; well, our mission, the division's mission is to\r\nstudy the antipersonnel effects of munitions, including kinetic energy\r\nmunitions, incendiary, and some chemical munitions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it the regular function of your unit then to test the\r\neffects of bullet wounds on various parts of the human body?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And does Dr. Olivier function under your direction in his\r\ncapacity as chief of the Wounds Ballistics Branch?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; his branch is one of the branches of the Biophysics\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been present today to hear the full testimony of\r\nDr. Olivier?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the tests which he described, performed under your\r\ngeneral supervision and direction as his superior?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the underlying facts which those tests disclosed,\r\ndo you have any details to add as to results which you think would be\r\nhelpful or significant for the Commission to know?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Well, I think that Dr. Olivier described them pretty well\r\non the whole, got all the details in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you agree with the recitation of the detailed findings,\r\nthen, as described by Dr. Olivier?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I do, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then moving to the general topic of reconstructing the\r\nevents in terms of what professional opinion you may have as to what\r\nactually occurred at Dallas, permit me to ask you some questions in\r\nterms of the known medical facts, and in the light of the results of\r\nthis series of tests which you have performed. First of all, have you\r\nhad access to the autopsy report on President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had access to the same general information\r\ndescribed by Dr. Olivier on the wounds inflicted on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes, I have. I did not speak to the surgeons. I was not\r\nhere at that time. My information on Dr. Connally's wounds----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Governor Connally, are from the reports and from\r\ndiscussions with Dr. Light or Dr. Olivier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that all of the information available to Dr. Light and\r\nDr. Olivier obtained through consultations with Governor Connally's\r\ndoctors, Dr. Shaw and Dr. Gregory, have been passed on to you? In\r\naddition, you have had access to the records of Parkland Hospital on\r\nGovernor Connally's treatment there?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to observe certain films\r\nknown as the Zapruder films showing the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. No; I did not see those.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had, then, brought to your attention the\r\napproximate distances involved from the situation here, to wit;\r\nthat the shots were fired from a 6th floor window at a distance of\r\napproximately 160 to 250 feet at a moving vehicle, striking the\r\nGovernor and the President at angles estimated from 25 to 45 degrees,\r\nthe angle of impact on President Kennedy being given by the autopsy\r\nsurgeon as a 45-degree angle of declination, and the angle on Governor\r\nConnally being described as 25 to 27 degrees?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Yes, I did----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You are speaking now of the first two wounds, aren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You are not speaking now of the brain wound at all, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Correct, Mr. Dulles. The wound that I am referring to\r\non the President is the wound which entered the back of his neck and\r\nexited from the front part of his neck in accordance with the prior\r\ntestimony of the doctors in the case.\r\n\r\nNow, based on the tests which have been performed, and the other\r\nfactors which I will ask you to assume, since you weren't present; for\r\npurposes of expressing an opinion, what is your opinion as to whether\r\nall of the wounds on Governor Connally were inflicted by one bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. My opinion is that it is most probably so, that one\r\nbullet produced all the wounds on Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your opinion as to whether the wound through\r\nPresident Kennedy's neck and all of the wounds on Governor Connally\r\nwere produced by one bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I think the probability is very good that it is, that all\r\nthe wounds were caused by one bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say all the wounds, are you excluding from that\r\nthe head wound on President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I am excluding the head wound, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the reasoning behind your conclusion that one\r\nbullet caused the neck wound on President Kennedy and all of the other\r\nwounds on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I am saying that the probability is high that that was so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the reason for your assessment of that high\r\nprobability?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. The same reasons that Dr. Olivier gave, based on the\r\nsame information, that especially the wound to the wrist. That higher\r\nvelocity strike on the wrist would be caused by the bullet slowing down\r\nby going through all this tissue would cause more damage to the wrist\r\nand also more damage to the thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the bullet only gone through Governor Connally's chest\r\nthen, what is your opinion as to whether or not there would have been\r\ngreater damage to the Governor's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I think there would have been greater damage to the\r\nGovernor's wrist, and also to the thigh from the information, from the\r\nexperiments obtained by Dr. Olivier's group.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question here? Does that take into account\r\nany evidence as to the angle of fire and the relative positions of the\r\ntwo men, or excluding that?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Excluding that. I do not know enough details about that\r\nto make an opinion on that. This is just on the basis of the velocities\r\nof the bullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the nature of the wounds on the Governor's wrist\r\nand thigh, then, be explained by the hypothesis that the bullet passed\r\nthrough the President first, then went through the Governor's chest\r\nbefore striking the wrist and in turn the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I think that could be a good explanation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your opinion as to whether or not a fragment of\r\na bullet striking the President's head could have caused the wound to\r\nGovernor Connally's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I think it is unlikely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your opinion as to whether or not Governor\r\nConnally's wrist wound could have been caused by a pristine bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. That is unlikely, too. Our results with pristine bullets\r\nwere very different from the wound that the Governor had.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the description provided to you of the nature of\r\nthe wound in the Governor's back, what is your opinion as to whether,\r\nor not, that was a pristine bullet or had yaw in it, just on the basis\r\nof the nature of the wound on the Governor's back?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. It could very well have yaw in it because of the rather\r\nlarge wound that was produced in the Governor's back. The wound from a\r\nnonyawing bullet could be considerably smaller.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the record, would you define in lay terms what yaw\r\nmeans?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. It is the procession of the bullet. The bullet is\r\nwobbling on its axis, so that as it wobbles, it presents different\r\npresented areas to the target or to the air, and this changes the drag\r\ncoefficient of the bullet. It will slow down the bullet more both in\r\nthe air and in tissues, in the yawing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the course of a bullet, then, which is a pristine\r\nbullet or the nature of the bullet immediately after coming out of the\r\nmuzzle of a rifle before it strikes anything?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. A pristine bullet is normally stable. It does not\r\nwobble in the air. It presents the same presented area along most of\r\nits trajectory until it slows down, so that the drag coefficient in\r\nair or in the tissue of this type of bullet is less than the drag\r\ncoefficient----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by drag coefficient?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. It is a measurement of the resistance of the target\r\nmaterial or the air to the bullet. The greater the drag coefficient,\r\nthe more the resistance to the bullet, the more the bullet slows down\r\nwithin a given time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So would a bullet with yaw cause a greater or lesser hole\r\non the surface which it strikes than a bullet without yaw?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. It would normally cause a greater hole. It usually would\r\nhave more presented area, that is more the surface of the bullet would\r\nhit the skin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would a bullet with yaw decrease in velocity to a\r\ngreater, lesser, or the same extent as a bullet without yaw?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. It would decrease in velocity to a greater extent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whether it passed through air or----\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. Or through tissue, and the important thing in tissue is\r\nthat it transfers more energy to the target than would a nonyawing\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Dziemian, Governor Connally testified that he\r\nexperienced the sensation of a striking blow on his back which he\r\ndescribed as being similar to a hard punch received from a doubled-up\r\nfist. Do you have an opinion as to whether that sensation would\r\nnecessarily occur immediately upon impact of a wound such as that\r\nreceived by Governor Connally, or could there be a delayed reaction in\r\nsensing that feeling?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I don't have too much of an opinion on that. All I can\r\nsay is that some people are struck by bullets and do not even know they\r\nare hit. This happens in wartime. But I don't know about that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that it is possible in some situations there is some\r\ndelay in reaction?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it a highly individual matter as to the reaction of an\r\nindividual on that subject?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But take a wound like the wrist wound of Governor Connally.\r\nHe couldn't get that without knowing it, could he?\r\n\r\nDr. DZIEMIAN. I think he said that he didn't know he had a wrist wound\r\nuntil much later.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have no further questions of Dr. Dziemian, Commissioner\r\nDulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK W. LIGHT, JR.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Doctor, would you give your full name?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Frederick W. Light, Jr.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you raise your right hand? Do you swear that the\r\ntestimony that you will give before this Commission is the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Light, the purpose of asking you to appear today is\r\nto question you concerning the results of tests taken at the Edgewood\r\nArsenal. With that brief statement of purpose, I will ask you to state\r\nyour full name for the record, please.\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Frederick W. Light, Jr.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your business or profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I am a physician specializing in pathology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I have an A.B. from Lafayette in 1926, M.D. from Johns\r\nHopkins Medical School in 1930, and Ph. D. from Hopkins in 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline your experience since 1933 in a very\r\ngeneral way, please?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Well, in 1933 I was still at the Reading Hospital, resident\r\nin pathology. Between then and 1940 I was pathologist in Clarksburg, W.\r\nVa., and later in Springfield, Ill. In 1940 I returned to Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity to study mathematics for awhile.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To study mathematics?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes. And then in 1952, or 1951, excuse me, I began working\r\nat Edgewood Arsenal where I am at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What have your duties consisted of while working at\r\nEdgewood Arsenal?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Primarily the study of pathology of wounding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your formal title there now, Dr. Light?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I am chief of the Wound Assessment Branch and assistant\r\nchief of the Biophysics Division.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your relationship to Dr. Olivier and Dr.\r\nDziemian?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Dr. Dziemian is the chief of the division. Dr. Olivier\r\nis chief of one of the branches, and I am chief of one of the other\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been present here today to hear the full\r\ntestimony of Dr. Olivier?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were the tests which he described conducted under your\r\njoint supervision with Dr. Olivier?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Only a very general way. I wouldn't want to say I supervised\r\nhim at all. We discussed what he was going to do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be more accurate to state that you coordinated\r\nwith him in the tests which were under his general supervision?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; that might be stretching it a bit even.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would you characterize your participation?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Largely--originally Dr. Dziemian, as I recall, was ill, and\r\nby the time we began to do these specific tests that you mention,\r\nDr. Dziemian was back on the job again. So he took over whatever\r\nsupervision was needed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the tests which Dr. Olivier described made at the\r\nrequest of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add by way of any detail to the\r\nfindings reported by Dr. Olivier in his testimony here earlier today?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. No; I think he covered it very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as to the conclusions and opinions which he expressed,\r\ndo you agree or disagree, to some extent, on his conclusions?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I agree in general at least. I am not quite so certain about\r\nsome of the things, but generally I certainly agree with what he said.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What are the things on which you are not quite so certain?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. For example, I am not quite as sure in my mind as I believe\r\nhe is that the bullet that struck the Governor was almost certainly one\r\nwhich had hit something else first. I believe it could have produced\r\nthat wound even though it hadn't hit the President or any other person\r\nor object first.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the wound, then, in the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. No; in the chest.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was thinking that the wound in the thigh--let me start\r\nagain. As I understand the previous testimony, Dr. Olivier would have\r\nexpected the wound in the thigh to be more serious if it had not hit\r\nsome object.\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Prior to entering Governor Connally's body, but you feel\r\nthat the wound in the thigh might be consistent?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. The wound in the thigh is the terminal end, is the far end\r\nof the whole track. I don't believe that in passing through the tissue\r\nwhich was simulated by what Dr. Olivier described first, 13 or 14\r\ncentimeters of gelatin, I don't believe that the change in velocity\r\nintroduced by the passage through that much tissue can be relied upon\r\nto make such a definite difference in the effect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you believe that if the Governor had been struck by a\r\npristine bullet which had gone through his chest, that it would have\r\ncaused no more damage than which appeared on the Governor's chest?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I think that is possible; yes. I might say I think perhaps\r\nthe best, the most likely thing is what everyone else has said so far,\r\nthat the bullet did go through the President's neck and then through\r\nthe chest and then through the wrist and then into the thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You think that is the most likely possibility?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I think that is probably the most likely, but I base\r\nthat not entirely on the anatomical findings but as much on the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What are the circumstances which lead you to that\r\nconclusion?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. The relative positions in the automobile of the President\r\nand the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other circumstances which contribute to that\r\nconclusion, other than the anatomical findings?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. And the appearance of the bullet that was found and the\r\nplace it was found, presumably, the bullet was the one which wounded\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The whole bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. The whole bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Identified as Commission Exhibit No. 399?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what about that whole bullet leads you to believe that\r\nthe one bullet caused the President's neck wound and all of the wounds\r\non Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Nothing about that bullet. Mainly the position in which they\r\nare seated in the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So in addition to the----\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. And the fact that the bullet that passed through the\r\nPresident's body lost very little velocity since it passed through\r\nsoft tissue, so that it would strike the Governor, if it did, with a\r\nvelocity only, what was it, 100 feet per second, very little lower than\r\nit would have if it hadn't struck anything else first. I am not sure,\r\nI didn't see, of course, none of us saw the wounds in the Governor in\r\nthe fresh state or any other time, and I am not too convinced from\r\nthe measurements and the descriptions that were given in the surgical\r\nreports and so on that the actual holes through the skin were unusually\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had access to the autopsy records?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had access to the reports of Parkland\r\nHospital on the Governor's operations there?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All three of them?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to view the films of the\r\nassassination commonly known as the Zapruder films?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the slides?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to talk to Dr. Shaw and\r\nDr. Gregory who performed the thoracic and wrist operations on Governor\r\nConnally?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you heard Governor Connally's version yourself?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; but not in----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Not in the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Not in the Commission session.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But at the time when the films were viewed by the Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the VFW building on the first floor?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Focusing on a few of the specific considerations, do you\r\nbelieve that there would have been the same amount of damage done to\r\nthe Governor's wrist had the pristine bullet only passed through the\r\nGovernor's body without striking the President first?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I think that is possible; yes. It won't happen the same way\r\ntwice in any case, so you have got a fairly wide range of things that\r\ncan happen if a person is shot in more or less this way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think it is as likely that the damage would have\r\nbeen inflicted on the Governor's wrist as it was, with the bullet\r\npassing only through the Governor's chest as opposed to passing through\r\nthe President's neck and the Governor's chest?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I think the difference in likelihood is negligible on that\r\nbasis alone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So the damage on the Governor's wrist would be equally\r\nconsistent----\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Equally consistent; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With (_A_) passing only through the Governor's chest, or\r\n(_B_) passing through the President's neck and the Governor's chest?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as to the damage on the thigh, would the nature of\r\nthat wound again be equally consistent with either going through (_A_)\r\nthe President's neck, the Governor's chest, the Governor's wrist, and\r\nthen into the thigh, or (_B_) only through the Governor's chest, the\r\nGovernor's wrist and into the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I'd say equally consistent; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And based on the descriptions which have been provided to\r\nyou about the nature of the wound on the Governor's back, do you have\r\nan opinion as to whether the bullet was yawing or not at the time it\r\nstruck the Governor's back?\r\n\r\nMr. LIGHT. No; I don't. That is really one of the points----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It would be either way?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; I don't feel too certain that it was yawing. The\r\nmeasurements were not particularly precise as far as I could tell.\r\nYou wouldn't expect them to be in an operating room. So I think it is\r\ndifficult to be sure there that the missile wasn't presenting nose on.\r\nIt undoubtedly struck not at normal instance, that is to say it was a\r\ncertain obliquity, just in the nature of the way the shoulder is built.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then do you think based on only the anatomical findings\r\nand the results of the tests which Dr. Olivier has performed that the\r\nscales are in equipoise as to whether the bullet passed through the\r\nPresident first and then through the Governor or passed only through\r\nthe Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; I would say I don't feel justified in drawing a\r\nconclusion one way or the other on that basis alone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any preference of any sort?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Yes; I do, for other reasons.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But only for the other reasons?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. As I mentioned, their positions in the automobile, the\r\nfact that if it wasn't the way--if one bullet didn't produce all\r\nof the wounds in both of the individuals, then that bullet ought\r\nto be somewhere, and hasn't been found. But those are not based on\r\nDr. Olivier's tests nor are they based on the autopsy report or the\r\nsurgeon's findings in my mind.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. On the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Light, do you have an opinion as to whether or not the\r\nwound inflicted on Governor Connally's wrist could have been caused by\r\na fragment which struck the President's head?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. It is barely conceivable but I do not believe that that is\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say barely?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. Barely conceivable. I mean a fragment probably had enough\r\nvelocity, it couldn't have produced that wound, in my mind, but it\r\ncan't be ruled out with complete certainty.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think would be\r\nhelpful to the Commission in any way?\r\n\r\nDr. LIGHT. I don't believe I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Those are all the questions I have, Commissioner Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much indeed. I express our appreciation.\r\nI didn't realize these tests were being carried out. I am very glad\r\nthey have been. It is a very useful thing to do and very helpful to\r\nthe Commission. Thank you very much. I want to thank all three of you\r\ndoctors for having so fully cooperated in this matter, and I think that\r\nthese tests that you have run have made a real contribution to the\r\nCommission's work.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:10 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, May 14, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF J. EDGAR HOOVER, JOHN A. McCONE, AND RICHARD M. HELMS\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:15 a.m., on May 14, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and\r\nAllen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Charles Murray and Walter Craig, observers; and\r\nWaggoner Carr, attorney general of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF J. EDGAR HOOVER\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nDirector Hoover, will you please raise your right hand to be sworn,\r\nplease. You solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthe Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rankin will carry on the examination, Mr. Director.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, do you want to tell him briefly what our\r\npurpose is?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Oh, yes; it is our practice to make a brief statement\r\nbefore the testimony of each witness, and I will do it now.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoover will be asked to testify in regard to whether Lee H. Oswald\r\nwas ever an agent, directly or indirectly, or an informer or acting on\r\nbehalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any capacity at any\r\ntime, and whether he knows of any credible evidence of any conspiracy,\r\neither domestic or foreign, involved in the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nWhat he has to say about an article in the National Enquirer,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 837, and concerning the failure to include\r\nthe name and information concerning special agent Hosty in the\r\ninitial report of the Oswald address book and any suggestions and\r\nrecommendations he may have concerning improvements or changes in\r\nprovisions for the protection of the President of the United States.\r\nNow, Mr. Rankin, you may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, will you state for the record your name and\r\nposition?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation of the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live, Mr. Hoover?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I live at 4936 30th Place, Northwest, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you have been Director of the Bureau for some 40 years\r\naccording to the newspapers?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct; since 1924.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have furnished us a considerable amount of information,\r\nMr. Hoover, about whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was ever an agent or\r\nacting for the Bureau in any capacity as informer or otherwise at any\r\ntime. Are those statements correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. They are correct. I can most emphatically say that at no\r\ntime was he ever an employee of the Bureau in any capacity, either as\r\nan agent or as a special employee, or as an informant.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I call your particular attention to Exhibit 835, and\r\nsuggest that you will find that that is your letter, together with\r\nyour affidavit about this subject matter, and other matters that you\r\nfurnished to us concerning this particular subject.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you wish to add anything?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. No; there is nothing that I desire to add to what appears\r\nin this letter and my affidavit which accompanied it to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have provided many things to us in assisting the\r\nCommission in connection with this investigation and I assume, at\r\nleast in a general way, you are familiar with the investigation of the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct. When President Johnson returned to\r\nWashington he communicated with me within the first 24 hours, and\r\nasked the Bureau to pick up the investigation of the assassination\r\nbecause as you are aware, there is no Federal jurisdiction for such\r\nan investigation. It is not a Federal crime to kill or attack the\r\nPresident or the Vice President or any of the continuity of officers\r\nwho would succeed to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nHowever, the President has a right to request the Bureau to make\r\nspecial investigations, and in this instance he asked that this\r\ninvestigation be made. I immediately assigned a special force headed\r\nby the special agent in charge at Dallas, Tex., to initiate the\r\ninvestigation, and to get all details and facts concerning it, which we\r\nobtained, and then prepared a report which we submitted to the Attorney\r\nGeneral for transmission to the President.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. From your study of this entire matter of the assassination\r\nand work in connection with it, do you know of any credible evidence\r\nthat has ever come to your attention that there was a conspiracy either\r\nforeign or domestic involved in the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I know of no substantial evidence of any type that would\r\nsupport any contention of that character. I have read all of the\r\nrequests that have come to the Bureau from this Commission, and I have\r\nread and signed all the replies that have come to the Commission.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have read many of the reports that our agents have made\r\nand I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any\r\nforeign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask this, Mr. Hoover. As I understand your\r\ntestimony, it is based on the evidence that has been accumulated thus\r\nfar?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is the Federal Bureau of Investigation continuing\r\nits investigation of all possible ramifications of this assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct. We are receiving and we, I expect, will\r\ncontinue to receive for days or weeks to come, letters from individuals\r\nthat normally would probably be in the category of what we would\r\ncall crank letters in which various weird allegations are made or in\r\nwhich people have reported psychic vibrations. We are still running\r\nout letters of that character and in turn making a report to this\r\nCommission upon it, notwithstanding the fact that on the face of it the\r\nallegation is without any foundation. Individuals who could not have\r\nknown any of the facts have made some very strange statements. There\r\nhave been publications and books written, the contents of which have\r\nbeen absurd and without a scintilla of foundation of fact. I feel, from\r\nmy experience in the Bureau, where we are in constant receipt over the\r\nyears of these so-called crank letters, that such allegations will be\r\ngoing on possibly for some years to come.\r\n\r\nI, personally, feel that any finding of the Commission will not be\r\naccepted by everybody, because there are bound to be some extremists\r\nwho have very pronounced views, without any foundation for them, who\r\nwill disagree violently with whatever findings the Commission makes.\r\nBut I think it is essential that the FBI investigate the allegations\r\nthat are received in the future so it can't be said that we had ignored\r\nthem or that the case is closed and forgotten.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you give us some idea of how many agents are\r\ncurrently working to one degree or another on any aspects of this case?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I would estimate, Congressman Ford, that there are at the\r\npresent time at least 50 or 60 men giving their entire time to various\r\naspects of the investigation, because while Dallas is the office of\r\norigin, investigation is required in auxiliary offices such as Los\r\nAngeles or San Francisco, and even in some foreign countries like\r\nMexico. We have representatives in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the investigation, following the assassination, it was\r\nthe desire of the President to have this report completed by the Bureau\r\njust as quickly as possible, and as thoroughly as possible, and I would\r\nsay we had about 150 men at that time working on the report in the\r\nfield, and at Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nNow, all the reports that come in from the field are, of course,\r\nreviewed at Washington by the supervisor in charge of the case, and\r\nthen in turn by the assistant director of the division, and then in\r\nturn by Mr. Belmont, who is the assistant to the Director.\r\n\r\nReports in which there is a controversial issue or where statements\r\nhave been made of the existence of some particular thing that we have\r\nnever heard of before, I myself, go over these to see that we haven't\r\nmissed anything or haven't had any gap in the investigation so it can\r\nbe tied down.\r\n\r\nRecently the National Enquirer had a fantastic article in it as to the\r\nexistence of a letter that had been written or a request that had been\r\nmade by the Department of Justice to Chief Curry of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, to withhold arresting Rubinstein, or Ruby, and Oswald after\r\nthe Oswald attempt on General Walker's life.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had the agent in charge at Dallas interview Chief Curry and\r\nI have sent to the Commission a letter as to what Chief Curry had to\r\nsay. He branded it as an entire lie--that he had never received any\r\nrequest of that kind. I had our files searched to be certain we had\r\nnot written any such letter as that and found we had not. I requested\r\nthe Department of Justice to advise me whether they had written any\r\nsuch letter and Mr. Katzenbach advises there is no reference in the\r\nDepartment files to the alleged letter from any Department of Justice\r\nofficial to Chief Curry nor any reference that an FBI official was\r\nasked to request the Dallas police not to arrest Oswald or Ruby.\r\nA letter is being sent to the Commission today setting forth this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The point that I think ought to be made is that\r\ndespite the magnitude of the effort that has been made by the FBI\r\nand by other agencies, and despite the tremendous effort that has\r\nbeen made, I believe, by the Commission to help and assist and to\r\nconsolidate all of the evidence that we possibly could, that there is\r\nalways the possibility at some future date that some evidence might\r\ncome to the surface.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is, of course, possible; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I want just to be sure that no leads, no evidence\r\nregardless of its credibility will be ignored, that it will be pursued\r\nby the Bureau or any other agency to make certain that it is good, bad\r\nor of no value.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Well, I can assure you so far as the FBI is concerned,\r\nthe case will be continued in an open classification for all time.\r\nThat is, any information coming to us or any report coming to us from\r\nany source will be thoroughly investigated, so that we will be able\r\nto either prove or disprove the allegation. We found in the course of\r\nour investigations that individuals have made statements. Yet, when we\r\ninvestigate they will frankly admit that the statement is an entire\r\nfalsehood, or that they don't know why they wrote the letter or why\r\nthey made the statement. But, nevertheless, we have the record and\r\ngenerally in those instances we try to get a signed statement from that\r\nindividual so it can be made a part of the record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Under your authority from the President, the\r\nauthority which gave you the FBI, the responsibility to conduct this\r\ninvestigation it is not an authority with a terminal point. It is an\r\nauthority that goes on indefinitely?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Very definitely so. The President wanted a full and\r\nthorough investigation made of this matter, and we have tried to do\r\nso. As I have stated, I think we will continue to receive allegations.\r\nI think this will be a matter of controversy for years to come,\r\njust like the Lincoln assassination. There will be questions raised\r\nby individuals, either for publicity purposes or otherwise, that\r\nwill raise some new angle or new aspect of it. I think we must, and\r\ncertainly we intend in the FBI to continue to run down any such\r\nallegations or reports of that kind.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, Congressman Boggs.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Hoover, I don't want any cover--to cover any\r\nground which has been covered but I just have one or two questions.\r\nFirst, let me say that you and the Bureau have been very cooperative\r\nwith this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And tremendously helpful. I have been concerned\r\nabout some of these wild press reports and concerned about what impact\r\nit may have ultimately on the history of this thing. For instance there\r\nis a man named Buchanan who has written a series of articles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A book now. A book is out; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. A book now. I understand they have been widely\r\ncirculated in the European press, and this man came here and was, as\r\nI got it from some other sources, he took in some people here, some\r\nAmerican journalists, and I am told that this man has a Communist\r\nbackground, and in addition to that is a most unreliable person. He has\r\nmade these allegations that the Dallas police force was involved in the\r\nassassination and so on.\r\n\r\nWould you have any suggestions on how this Commission should deal with\r\nthis sort of thing?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We have received a request from the Commission to review\r\nthat book and to make a report upon any portions of it that can be\r\ncontradicted or substantiated by actual facts or documents. I know\r\nBuchanan's background. He worked on the Washington Star and he was\r\ndismissed from the Washington Star because he was a member of the\r\nCommunist Party. He spent much of his time in recent years in France\r\nwriting for French newspapers. I have followed the articles that\r\nhe has written about this matter and they are what I would call\r\n\"journalistic garbage.\" There is not a scintilla of truth to most of\r\nthe things he has written in these articles and in his book which I\r\nhave had a chance to scan but haven't actually reviewed yet. It is\r\nbeing reviewed by my research section. Some of the allegations are\r\nutterly fantastic. I often wonder where some of these individuals get\r\nsuch ideas and why they make such statements without foundation.\r\n\r\nNow, he makes many wild charges there, and to read it, a person not\r\nknowing him, or his views, or his background, would be inclined to\r\nwonder. I think you are going to have that problem, as I say, for years\r\nto come. I don't know how you can handle individuals like him other\r\nthan to have the record clear upon the facts of the case, and either\r\nsubstantiate or disprove his statements. I don't think too much time\r\nshould be given to these individuals who have such unsavory backgrounds\r\nas Buchanan has and who makes statements that have been proved to be\r\nuntrue. But, at the same time I think when a book like that comes out\r\nor an article of that type comes out that deals with the assassination\r\nof the late President, I think it should be gone into from an\r\ninvestigative point of view. We should then submit to this Commission,\r\neven after it has concluded its hearings, for record purposes, what we\r\nhave found in each particular instance.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Now, on the other side of the fence----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I add one other thing just to interrupt. I wish you\r\nwould add to your list a book called \"The Red Roses of Dallas\" by a man\r\nnamed Gun. He is a more reliable correspondent.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. He is a Philadelphia correspondent.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He has been living in this country since 1946. I have met\r\nhim over here. Let's see, he was at Dallas at the time. He was then\r\nreporting, I think, for the Italian newspaper Epoca.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is not the same one.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He might have been lying. This book is full of lies. But I\r\nthink it is a book that ought to be added, too, and I will see that a\r\ncopy is sent to the Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I would appreciate that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. On the other side of the spectrum some professor\r\nout at the University of Illinois wrote a piece in which he alleged\r\nthe President was a Communist agent, President Kennedy, and Buchanan's\r\nallegations are that the extreme right assassinated the President and\r\nthis fellow's allegations are that the Communists assassinated the\r\nPresident. Would you care to comment? Have you read that piece?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I have read that piece. My comment on it is this in\r\ngeneral: I think the extreme right is just as much a danger to the\r\nfreedom of this country as the extreme left. There are groups,\r\norganizations, and individuals on the extreme right who make these\r\nvery violent statements, allegations that General Eisenhower was a\r\nCommunist, disparaging references to the Chief Justice and at the other\r\nend of the spectrum you have these leftists who make wild statements\r\ncharging almost anybody with being a Fascist or belonging to some\r\nof these so-called extreme right societies. Now, I have felt, and I\r\nhave said publicly in speeches, that they are just as much a danger,\r\nat either end of the spectrum. They don't deal with facts. Anybody\r\nwho will allege that General Eisenhower was a Communist agent, has\r\nsomething wrong with him.\r\n\r\nA lot of people read such allegations because I get some of the\r\nweirdest letters wanting to know whether we have inquired to find out\r\nwhether that is true. I have known General Eisenhower quite well myself\r\nand I have found him to be a sound, level-headed man.\r\n\r\nIn New York City there is a woman by the name of Kraus who must be\r\nmentally deranged as she stands on a Broadway corner there handing out\r\nleaflets in which she charges me with being in the conspiracy with the\r\nCommunists to overthrow this Government and so forth.\r\n\r\nWell now, if any person has fought communism, I certainly have fought\r\nit. We have tried to fight it and expose it in democratic ways I think\r\nthat is the thing we have to very definitely keep in mind in this whole\r\nproblem in the security of the President and the successor to office.\r\nJust how far you are going to go for his protection and his security. I\r\ndon't think you can get absolute security without almost establishing a\r\npolice state, and we don't want that. You can't put security in a black\r\ngroove or a white groove. It is in a gray groove, and certain chances\r\nhave to be taken. You are dealing with a human being when you are\r\ndealing with the President of the United States. President Johnson is a\r\nvery down to earth human being, and it makes the security problem all\r\nthe more difficult, but you can't bar him from the people.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things that can be done, and I submitted a memorandum\r\nto the Secret Service, and to the White House on certain security\r\nsteps that might be taken and tightened up. But you are dealing with\r\nthe general public and that is what has given me great concern in the\r\nrecent expansion, of the criteria for dissemination that we adopted\r\nafter the assassination.\r\n\r\nPrior to that time we reported to the Secret Service all information\r\nthat dealt with individuals who were potential killers or by whom\r\nacts of violence might be anticipated. The Secret Service would take\r\nthat information and would do with it as they saw fit. I gave great\r\nconsideration to it because I am not very happy with the criteria\r\nexpansion, but I felt we had to include subversives of various\r\ncharacter, and extremists. We have, in turn, furnished their names to\r\nthe Secret Service. I think 5,000 names up to the present time already\r\nhave been submitted and there are at least three or four thousand more\r\nthat will be submitted within the next few months.\r\n\r\nThen you come to the problem of what you are going to do when the\r\nSecret Service gets those names. They have to call upon the local\r\nauthorities. Just recently, in the city of Chicago, when the President\r\nwas there, the local authorities were asked to give assistance as they\r\nusually do to the Secret Service and they went to the homes of some of\r\nthese people, and it resulted really almost in a house arrest.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't think there is any place in this country for that\r\nkind of thing, but these people who belonged to extreme subversive\r\norganizations or organizations that advocated the overthrow of\r\ngovernment by force and violence were told that they couldn't leave\r\ntheir house or if they did they would be accompanied by a police\r\nofficer. That gives me great concern because in New York City alone,\r\nyou run into maybe three or four thousand such individuals who would be\r\nmembers of subversive organizations, and then you get into the twilight\r\nzone of subversive fronts.\r\n\r\nNow, there again, merely because a man belongs to a subversive front\r\norganization, in my estimation doesn't mean that he is blacklisted and\r\nis a menace to the country for life. If he belongs to 20 of them, it\r\ncertainly shows either one of two things, he is either very gullible\r\nand dumb or he is a menace. That has been my attitude in regard to\r\nGovernment service where you find a Government employee who belonged to\r\none or two, maybe in his early days. I don't believe this necessarily\r\nmakes him a security risk. Rather, this would be dependent on the\r\ndegree of his activity in the front group and his purpose and intent in\r\nassociating himself with it. But where he has belonged to 15, 18, 20 of\r\nthem, I don't think he has enough good judgment to be in the Government.\r\n\r\nSome ministers get drawn into organizations, some of which are under\r\nthe domination of the Communist Party. Now, those ministers don't know\r\nthat. They are just as loyal and patriotic as you and I are, but they\r\nhappen to belong. Now, that is where the question of human judgment\r\nhas to be used. We try to use it in selecting these names. But I was\r\nstartled when I learned of the incident in Chicago because there you\r\ncome pretty close to a house arrest and we don't want that. We don't\r\nwant a gestapo. We have to, I think, maintain an even balance.\r\n\r\nI think it was very well expressed--\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask you, Mr. Hoover, was this house arrest based on\r\nnames you had furnished the Secret Service and they furnished the local\r\nauthorities?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That brings me back to the question I think I\r\nheard Congressman Ford ask you as I came into the room, because I\r\nthink this is the crux of our investigation.\r\n\r\nI read the FBI report very carefully and the whole implication of the\r\nreport is that, number one, Oswald shot the President; number two,\r\nthat he was not connected with any conspiracy of any kind, nature or\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you still subscribe to that?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I subscribe to it even more strongly today than I did at\r\nthe time that the report was written. You see, the original idea was\r\nthat there would be an investigation by the FBI and a report would be\r\nprepared in such form that it could be released to the public.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Surely.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Then a few days later, after further consideration,\r\nthe President decided to form a commission, which I think was very\r\nwise, because I feel that the report of any agency of Government\r\ninvestigating what might be some shortcomings on the part of other\r\nagencies of Government ought to be reviewed by an impartial group such\r\nas this Commission. And the more I have read these reports, the more I\r\nam convinced that Oswald was the man who fired the gun; and he fired\r\nthree times, killed the President, and wounded Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nAnd I also am further convinced that there is absolutely no association\r\nbetween Oswald or Ruby. There was no such evidence ever established.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or Oswald and anybody else? Would you go that far?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Anybody else who might be----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In connection with the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes; I would certainly go that far. There was suspicion at\r\nfirst this might be a Castro act.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We had information that had been obtained in Mexico City\r\nby another intelligence agency indicating there was a man who had seen\r\na certain amount of money passed to Oswald at the Cuban Consulate. I\r\nthink it was $6,000 that was passed. We went into that very thoroughly.\r\nThe man later retracted his statement and stated it was not true. He\r\nwas asked whether he would take a lie detector test, and he did. The\r\nlie detector test showed that he was telling a lie.\r\n\r\nAs to the lie detector, I do want to make this comment on it. I have\r\nalways held to the opinion that it is not a perfect piece of machinery.\r\nIt is an interpretation made by human beings of what the machine, the\r\npolygraph, shows. I would never want to convict or to send to the\r\npenitentiary any person solely on the evidence of the lie detector. It\r\nis a contribution in an investigation, a more or less psychological\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nBut I have seen individuals who have failed the lie detector test and\r\nwho were just as innocent as they could be. That particular lead in\r\nMexico City was completely disproved; there was no foundation for it.\r\n\r\nWe found no associations between Oswald and Ruby. There has been a\r\nstory printed that Ruby and Oswald worked together and were close\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThere was no evidence, there was never any indication that we could\r\nfind that Oswald had ever been in Ruby's nightclub or had had any\r\nassociation with him.\r\n\r\nRuby comes from Chicago, he was on the fringe of what you might call\r\nthe elements of the underworld there. He came to Dallas, opened up\r\nthe nightclub and it was a place where, certainly not the better\r\nclass of people went, but it wasn't any so-called \"joint,\" to use the\r\nvernacular. It was just another nightclub. So far as we have been able\r\nto establish there was no relationship or contact between Oswald and\r\nRuby or anyone else allegedly involved in this assassination.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. The FBI interviewed practically everybody who\r\never associated with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. It did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You didn't find any indication of why anyone\r\nshould even suspect that Oswald would do this, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We found no indication at all that Oswald was a man\r\naddicted to violence. The first indication of an act of violence came\r\nafter he, Oswald, had been killed, and Mrs. Oswald told us about the\r\nattempt on General Walker's life by Oswald. No one had known a thing\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nI think in the Enquirer article there is reference to the fact that the\r\nDallas Police knew or suspected Oswald of possibly being a party to the\r\nshooting into the house of General Walker. Chief Curry specifically\r\ndenies that. There was no connection of that kind and there was no\r\nevidence that Oswald had any streak of violence.\r\n\r\nWe went back into his Marine Corps record. He was a \"loner.\" He didn't\r\nhave many friends. He kept to himself, and when he went abroad, he\r\ndefected to Russia. The first evidence we had of him in our file was\r\na statement to the press in Moscow. And then later, about 22 months\r\nlater, he returned to the Embassy there and according to the report of\r\nthe Embassy we have and which the Commission has been furnished, the\r\nEmbassy gave him a clean bill. He had seen the error of his ways and\r\ndisliked the Soviet atmosphere, et cetera, and they, therefore, cleared\r\nhim, paid his way and paid his wife's way to come back to this country.\r\n\r\nAt no time, other than the so-called street disturbance in New Orleans,\r\nwas there any indication that he might be a fighter. Well, in that\r\nparticular instance he was handing out leaflets that he printed for\r\nthe Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and some of the anti-Castro forces,\r\nwe have several thousand of them in New Orleans alone, happened to see\r\nhim and they moved in on him and immediately the police moved in and\r\narrested him. I believe they fined him $10 for disorderly conduct.\r\nThere was no evidence in the place where he was employed in Dallas of\r\nacts of violence or temper or anything of that kind on his part.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You have spent your life studying criminology and\r\nviolence and subversion. Would you care to speculate on what may have\r\nmotivated the man? I know it would be just speculation.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. My speculation, Mr. Boggs, is that this man was no doubt a\r\ndedicated Communist. He prefers to call himself a Marxist, but there\r\nyou get into the field of semantics. He was a Communist, he sympathized\r\nthoroughly with the Communist cause.\r\n\r\nI don't believe now, as I look back on it, that he ever changed his\r\nviews when he asked to come back to this country. I personally feel\r\nthat when he went to the American Embassy in Moscow originally to\r\nrenounce his citizenship he should have been able right then and there\r\nto sign the renouncement. He never could have gotten back here. I think\r\nthat should apply to almost all defectors who want to defect and become\r\na part of a system of government that is entirely foreign to ours. If\r\nthey have that desire, they have that right, but if they indicate a\r\ndesire for it, let them renounce their citizenship at once.\r\n\r\nThat was not done. He stayed in Moscow awhile and he went to Minsk\r\nwhere he worked. There was no indication of any difficulty, personally\r\non his part there, but I haven't the slightest doubt that he was a\r\ndedicated Communist.\r\n\r\nThere has been some question raised which cannot be resolved, because\r\nOswald is dead, as to whether he was trying to kill the President or\r\ntrying to kill the Governor. He had had some correspondence with the\r\nGovernor as to the form of his discharge from the Marine Corps. It was\r\nnot a dishonorable discharge, but a discharge less than honorable after\r\nhe defected.\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally had left the Navy Department, and was back in Texas\r\nas Governor. Oswald may have had his anger or his animosity against\r\nthe Governor, but no one can say definitely--that is mere speculation,\r\nno one can tell that, because the gun and the sighting of the gun was\r\ndirected at the car.\r\n\r\nNow, first, it was thought that the President had been shot through the\r\nthroat that is what the doctors at the Parkland Hospital felt when he\r\nwas brought in.\r\n\r\nIf that had been true, the shot would have had to come from the\r\noverpass. But as soon as the body arrived in Washington, the doctors\r\nat Bethesda Hospital performed the autopsy and it was then determined\r\ndefinitely from their point of view that he had been shot from the\r\nrear, and that portions of the skull had been practically shot off.\r\nThere was no question but that the gun and the telescopic lens could\r\npinpoint the President perfectly. The car was moving slowly. It wasn't\r\ngoing at a high rate of speed, so that he had perfect opportunity to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, some people have raised the question: Why didn't he shoot the\r\nPresident as the car came toward the storehouse where he was working?\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is, I think, the fact there were some trees between\r\nhis window on the sixth floor and the cars as they turned and went\r\nthrough the park. So he waited until the car got out from under the\r\ntrees, and the limbs, and then he had a perfectly clear view of the\r\noccupants of the car, and I think he took aim, either on the President\r\nor Connally, and I personally believe it was the President in view of\r\nthe twisted mentality the man had.\r\n\r\nBut he had given no indication of that--we had interviewed him, I\r\nthink, three times. Of course, our interviews were predicated to find\r\nout whether he had been recruited by the Russian intelligence service,\r\nbecause they frequently do that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And had he been?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. He had not been, so he said, and we have no proof that\r\nhe was. He had been over there long enough but they never gave him\r\ncitizenship in Russia at all. I think they probably looked upon him\r\nmore as a kind of a queer sort of individual and they didn't trust him\r\ntoo strongly.\r\n\r\nBut just the day before yesterday information came to me indicating\r\nthat there is an espionage training school outside of Minsk--I don't\r\nknow whether it is true--and that he was trained at that school to\r\ncome back to this country to become what they call a \"sleeper,\" that\r\nis a man who will remain dormant for 3 or 4 years and in case of\r\ninternational hostilities rise up and be used.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any espionage school at Minsk or near Minsk, and I\r\ndon't know how you could find out if there ever was one because the\r\nRussians won't tell you if you asked them.\r\n\r\nThey do have espionage and sabotage schools in Russia and they do have\r\nan assassination squad that is used by them but there is no indication\r\nhe had any association with anything of that kind.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Now we have some people, including this man's\r\nmother, talk about Oswald having been an agent of the Government of the\r\nUnited States. I think his mother mentioned the CIA; she has made these\r\nstatements publicly for money, apparently.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes; she has.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Just for the purpose of the record, I think it\r\nwould be well if you would comment on that, Mr. Director.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Of course, we have interviewed his mother and his wife, and\r\nall his relatives, and everybody that he is known to have associated\r\nwith. His mother I would put in a category of being emotionally\r\nunstable. She has been around the country making speeches, and the\r\nfirst indication of her emotional instability was the retaining of a\r\nlawyer that anyone would not have retained if they really were serious\r\nin trying to get down to the facts. But she has been in New York City;\r\nshe has been in Chicago; I think other parts of the country, always\r\nspeaking for money.\r\n\r\nNow, that kind of an individual is the type we have seen over the\r\nyears, who will say almost anything to draw a crowd. Just to be able to\r\nsay something sensational. Many times we have gone out to such people\r\nand asked them specifically, \"Now, what is your basis for this?\" And\r\nthey will say, \"Well, I just had a feeling that that was true, so I\r\nsaid it.\"\r\n\r\nShe has never made that statement to us, but we have many other\r\ninstances where that kind of statement is made. They don't have the\r\nlegal evidence that you must have if you are going to take any positive\r\naction. I would put very little credence in anything that his mother\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI think his wife was a far more reliable person in statements that she\r\nmade, so far as we were able to ascertain, than his mother. I think the\r\nmother had in mind, naturally, the fact she wanted to clear her son's\r\nname, which was a natural instinct, but more importantly she was going\r\nto see how much money she could make, and I believe she has made a\r\nsubstantial sum.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And the allegations she has made about this man\r\nbeing an agent either of the CIA or the FBI are false?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Well, I can certainly speak for the FBI that it is false,\r\nand I have discussed the matter, naturally, with Mr. McCone, the\r\nDirector of CIA, and he, of course, will no doubt appear himself,\r\nbut there is no indication at all that he was employed by them. We\r\nfrequently get that kind of a story from individuals who, when they get\r\ninto some kind of difficulty, will claim they were working for the CIA\r\nor they were working for the FBI.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Surely.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Now, no one can work for the FBI without the approval being\r\ngiven at Washington and a record kept of it, even of the confidential\r\ninformants. That is very tightly controlled. We have no so-called lump\r\nsum that we can use to hire people. So there has to be a voucher and\r\nspecific details of payment. And I know at no time was he an informant\r\nor agent or a special employee or working in any capacity for the FBI.\r\n\r\nAs to the interviews we had with him in which he gave us some\r\ninformation, some of it was not the truth, but this was not\r\nparticularly significant. The interviews we had with him I would not\r\nterm as talking with an informant. He was interviewed while under\r\narrest by the New Orleans police, and then after he had committed this\r\nact of assassination we interviewed him in police headquarters in\r\nDallas. But they were the only contacts we had, I think four contacts\r\naltogether, and he received no money of any kind, no promise of any\r\nkind, and there was no indication that he was rendering assistance\r\nto the U.S. Government. We looked upon him as a criminal after the\r\nassassination, of course, and prior to that time we looked upon him\r\nas an individual who we suspected might become an agent of the Soviet\r\ngovernment. There was no proof of that, and we checked him carefully.\r\n\r\nWe knew of his contact with the Soviet Embassy here at Washington, his\r\ncontact with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New York, and his\r\ncontact with the Worker publication in New York. And none of those\r\ncontacts gave any indication of any tendency to commit violence.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who read the Daily Worker, or what is now the\r\nWorker, and you certainly can't brand them as hazards to the security\r\nof the country or as potential assassins. It is in that area that I\r\nam particularly concerned that we don't become hysterical and go too\r\nfar in restricting the citizens of our country from exercising their\r\ncivil and constitutional rights. The mere fact a person disagrees with\r\nyou in a matter on communism doesn't mean he should be arrested. Many\r\nCommunists make very violent speeches, and we know them, but I don't\r\nfeel that the time has come that they should be arrested. If they have\r\nviolated the laws of the United States, we will, then, proceed with\r\nprosecution, and the cases can then go through the courts. Such cases\r\nlast for years before they get to the Supreme Court, and even then such\r\ncases often start over on some legal angle. But, all in all, I think\r\nthat the enforcement of security and the enforcement of laws dealing\r\nwith subversion ought to be handled in the American manner.\r\n\r\nI am criticized by the extreme right for that. They put me in the\r\ncategory, I guess, along with General Eisenhower. But the extreme\r\nleft criticizes me, saying I believe that any person who has on a\r\nred necktie may be addicted to communism, and, therefore, is a great\r\ndanger. That is why I say the extremists at both ends are bad, and I\r\nhave repeated that several times publicly.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. No doubt about the problem being a difficult one.\r\nI remember some years back when these fanatics started shooting up the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I recall that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I happened to be there on the occasion and there\r\nwere many suggestions that we build a bulletproof glass enclosure\r\naround the Members of Congress and so on. Of course, all of us\r\nrejected those ideas because it would be totally incompatible with our\r\ndemocratic institutions and this, obviously, becomes a problem in the\r\nsecurity of the President; that is what you are telling us, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is the great problem. We have participated in the\r\nprotection of the President since the assassination. The Secret\r\nService indicates how many agents it needs when the President is\r\ntraveling somewhere or going somewhere in Washington, and then I assign\r\nthat number of agents to the Secret Service. They are not under my\r\ndirection. They are under the direction of the Secret Service because\r\nunder law they are charged with the protection of the President. We\r\nhave never done that before, but I felt that it was something we must\r\ndo if the Secret Service desired it. Sometimes, such as at the funeral\r\nof the late President Kennedy, the procession walked up Connecticut\r\nAvenue, which created a very, very grave security problem because they\r\nwere walking with these tall building on either side. As I recall,\r\nwe had the responsibility for the Cathedral, and we had 43 agents in\r\nthe Cathedral during the services. I was more concerned about these\r\ntall buildings, because all the small buildings have been torn down\r\nalong Connecticut Avenue, and there were about six or seven blocks to\r\nwalk. Not only the high officials of this Government, including the\r\nPresident, but the Queen of Greece, General de Gaulle, Emperor Haile\r\nSelassie, and many Prime Ministers were present. They were a perfect\r\ntarget for someone in some window.\r\n\r\nNow, you can't empty these buildings. It is impossible to do that,\r\nbecause you can't go to the Mayflower Hotel and say all front rooms\r\nmust be vacated. Other office buildings are there, even taller than\r\nthe Mayflower, and you can't make them keep everybody out of the front\r\noffices because then you get into a police state.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service does try to check to find out who have these various\r\noffices. We also check so if there is anything in our files on those\r\nindividuals the Secret Service is at once advised. When the President\r\ngoes to a banquet or a social occasion, all of the employees in the\r\nhotel, the cooks, waiters, and busboys, and so forth, are all checked\r\nby Secret Service to be certain there is no one with a background\r\nthat would indicate a hazard to the President. But that is as far as\r\nI think you can go. You can't put in a whole new staff of waiters and\r\nyou can't make people move out. People going to a Presidential function\r\nare generally invited by card or by list, and that is very carefully\r\nchecked at the entrance by the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nWe suggested a few more things that possibly could be done, and some of\r\nwhich I have doubts about. You speak about this matter of glass around\r\nthe galleries in the House. One of the suggestions that we made was\r\nthat there be bulletproof glass in front of the President's lectern. In\r\nmy own mind, I question whether that is wise. Knowing this President as\r\nthis President is, he wants to get close to the audience; he wants to\r\nreach over and shake hands with people. That concerns me because you\r\nnever know when an emotionally unstable person may be in that crowd.\r\nAs you noted, he has frequently brought groups into the White House\r\ngardens and walked around with people he didn't know. I know the Secret\r\nService people are concerned about it. I am concerned about it.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman last week expressed his concern that the President was\r\ntaking unnecessary chances.\r\n\r\nBut the governmental agency having the responsibility for guarding him,\r\nthe Secret Service, has a natural hesitancy to say, \"You can't do this.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Of course, for the record, President Kennedy had\r\nthe same difficulty.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is right. It was best expressed at Parkland Hospital.\r\nOne of President Kennedy's staff made the statement that the whole\r\nfault in this matter was that, in the choice between politics and\r\nsecurity, politics was chosen. That is exactly what happened. It was an\r\nopen car. I am thoroughly opposed to the President riding in an open\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThey did not have any armored car in the Secret Service at that time. I\r\nhave now sent one of our armored cars over for the President, but it is\r\na closed limousine. But on occasion, such as at Gettysburg and Atlanta\r\nthe other day, the President got out of the armored car which had been\r\nflown there for his use, and commandeered the car of the Secret Service\r\nwhich is wide open, so he could wave and see the people. Now, that is\r\na great hazard. I think he should always be in an armored car that is\r\nclosed, that can't have the top put down. But as you recall, President\r\nKennedy had the bubble top off of the car that he was in. It was not\r\narmored and the bubble top was made of plastic so a bullet could have\r\ngone through it very easily.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Hoover, you have categorically testified that\r\nthe FBI never at any time had Oswald as an agent, as an informant, or\r\nin any other way.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct. I couldn't make it more emphatic.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And Mr. Belmont testified to the same last week\r\nwhen he was before us.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Both you and he would be fully familiar with all\r\nof the records of the FBI in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We would, and we would not only be fully familiar with it\r\nbecause while Mr. Belmont is in charge of the Investigative Branch of\r\nthe Bureau--we have two assistants to the Director, one in charge of\r\nadministrative work and the other in charge of investigative work--we\r\nhave also checked the administrative records where vouchers or payments\r\nwould have been made and there is no indication that any money was\r\never paid to Oswald. We have obtained, and they are on file with the\r\nCommission, the affidavits of the agents, who at various times were\r\nin contact with Oswald, to the effect that he was not an informant;\r\nthat they had never paid him anything; that he was being questioned as\r\nto possible recruitment by the Soviet intelligence; so there was no\r\nevidence at any time indicating employment by the FBI.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you were not under any limitation or\r\nrestriction from any other authority in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Absolutely not. I have the entire control of whether a\r\nman shall be an informant or shall not be an informant. That comes\r\nunder my chain of command from the local office which has the matter\r\nat hand. They can't just put on an informant without our approval. The\r\nrecommendation on security informants comes to the Bureau; it goes\r\nthrough the Assistant Director of the Domestic Intelligence Division,\r\nand, in significant cases, goes to Mr. Belmont, and then to my desk for\r\nmy specific approval. So I, or my seat-of-government staff, have to\r\napprove every one of those who are used as informants in all classes\r\nof cases, not only in intelligence cases but in white-slave cases,\r\nautomobile thefts, and all of these cases.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is no limitation on what you can tell us\r\nabout this situation?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No limitation; no restrictions?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. No restriction. So far as the record of vouchers in\r\nthe Bureau are concerned, they are open to the inspection of this\r\nCommission at any time going back as far as you may want to go.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask just one question there? I think you have\r\nanswered it, but in your examination of this aspect as to whether or\r\nnot Oswald was an informer or employee or held any relationship to\r\nthe FBI, you, yourself, have looked into all of the means you have of\r\ndetermining that fact when you make the statement to us?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I have personally looked into that for two reasons: Because\r\nthe President asked me personally to take charge of this investigation\r\nand to direct it, and I knew that the report ultimately would be made\r\nto him. For that reason I became familiar with every step and every\r\naction that was taken. Then when the allegation was made by someone--I\r\nthink it was the mother of Oswald first, if I recall correctly--that\r\nhe was employed by some Government agency, the CIA, or FBI, and maybe\r\nboth, I insisted upon a check being made and any record showing any\r\nindication of that being brought to me. When they could find none, I\r\nthen asked for affidavits from the field force that had dealt with\r\nOswald as to whether they had hired him or paid him anything or given\r\nhim anything, and the affidavits are on file here that they had not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you have said there is no sum available to the\r\nFBI which would enable these men, these agents, to employ him out of\r\nany funds that are made available to them.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Oh, no; it must be done by voucher, and those vouchers are\r\nexamined by the General Accounting Office every year or so. We have\r\nno lump sum in the field offices for employment of informants as such\r\nwhich is not supported by vouchers.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have just about two questions, I may have to go in a\r\nfew minutes to the Senate. I would like to direct your attention to\r\nthat period of time when Oswald was a defector, beginning when he left\r\nthe United States and when he returned.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. During that period, did the FBI have any jurisdiction\r\nover intelligence regarding him, or any capacity to know?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. While he was in Russia?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. No; we did not. We were interested in knowing what he might\r\nsay in Russia that appeared in the press. That was our first intimation\r\nthat this man had defected, when we read it in a newspaper article. We\r\nwere, of course, interested in knowing when he would return or if he\r\nwould return. We had no jurisdiction as to what he was doing in Russia\r\nafter he had gone there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. As I understand it, you had no capacity at that time to\r\nfollow his activities?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is true. We have no agents in Russia. Foreign\r\nintelligence is handled by the Central Intelligence Agency, and our\r\nresponsibility is domestic. We work very closely together.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you had the jurisdiction since the assassination\r\nor the occasion to examine persons connected with the State Department\r\nconcerning the activities of Oswald in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Well----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would that be a matter for some other agency?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That could be a matter for CIA or for us after Oswald had\r\nreturned here.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Then he becomes a civilian in the country here. Now,\r\nthere is what we call a delimitation agreement among the Government\r\nintelligence agencies. For instance, the military branches of the\r\nGovernment have their own intelligence services and they handle all\r\nmilitary deviations in regard to espionage or things of that kind. If\r\nthey want our assistance and ask for it we, of course, will always\r\ncooperate. In regard to CIA, there are many cases which CIA and the\r\nFBI work jointly on, of individuals that may have been recruited over\r\nin Europe by the CIA, not by us, because we don't have authority to do\r\nthat abroad, but when that man comes to this country, the best ends of\r\nintelligence are served by having the two agencies work very closely\r\ntogether, conduct joint interviews, and exchange information very,\r\nvery freely. That has been going on ever since I can recall CIA being\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would like to testify to the fact that that cooperation\r\nexisted during the whole period I was Director, and I am sure it has\r\ncontinued now with great cooperation on both sides.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. It is a very necessary thing, because the intelligence\r\nagency of many of these foreign countries will cover the whole world\r\nand the country itself. Whereas in this country you have separate\r\nagencies covering espionage activities. CIA covers the foreign\r\nactivity, and the FBI the domestic activities, and they must be\r\ninterlocking. An espionage agent of the Soviet Government can arrive\r\nin New York today by plane from Paris and he can be in Mexico City\r\ntomorrow. Then, CIA would pick him up there. We would not pick him up\r\nthere. We would watch him while in this country, but as soon as he\r\ntakes that plane and leaves the United States CIA moves in on him. If\r\nhe comes back to the United States, we move in on him. Therefore, we\r\nhave a very close liaison.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, what we have done in government agencies is\r\nto have a liaison agent in our Bureau assigned to contact CIA, the\r\nPentagon, State Department, and various other agencies to cut out\r\nthe red tape of writing letters back and forth. In order to orally\r\nrelay information which has come to his attention, our representative\r\ncan immediately phone it over to the FBI, and if there is need, for\r\ninstance, to meet a plane coming in to New York or a boat that is\r\ndocking at New York, it is all accomplished within a matter of 45\r\nminutes or an hour.\r\n\r\nIf you went through this letter-writing process and the paper war that\r\ngoes on so often in the Government it might take a week or 10 days.\r\n\r\nThe FBI does have 10 legal attaches attached to 10 embassies abroad.\r\nTheir purpose is not operational. They don't investigate in those\r\ncountries any matters that have to be investigated. That, if it is to\r\nbe done, is handled by CIA. Our purpose in being there is to maintain\r\nliaison with our opposite number such as the Surete Nationale in\r\nFrance and with the national police in the Philippines, to exchange\r\ninformation that is vital to our internal security, and also vital to\r\nthe internal security of the other country.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask one other question?\r\n\r\nIs there any, considering the number of defectors in the United States\r\nto Communist countries, which cannot be large, I would assume----\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I think there are about 36.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which would indicate, I would think either a lack of\r\nreliability on their part and stability or beyond that a dedicated\r\npurpose to become Communists, then upon their return, wouldn't it seem\r\nto you they should be given some special attention?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We have now----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. To determine whether they are a risk to become Soviet\r\nor Communist espionage agents or in fact become dangerous?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We have taken steps to plug that gap.\r\n\r\nPrior to the assassination of the President, a defector, before he came\r\nback was always cleared for return by a representative of the State\r\nDepartment or the military abroad. When he came back we immediately\r\ninterviewed him if he was a civilian. It had to be done promptly to\r\ndetermine whether he could be a potential intelligence agent.\r\n\r\nNow, in December of last year, following the assassination, we expanded\r\nthe criteria of what should be furnished to the Secret Service, and all\r\ndefectors automatically go on the list to be furnished to the Secret\r\nService.\r\n\r\nThere are 36 defectors that we know of in this country who have been\r\nunder investigation. Some of those men may have changed their views\r\nsincerely. Some of them may not have. But as a matter of general\r\nprecaution, as a result of the Oswald situation, we are seeing that all\r\ngo to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That includes military defectors, does it not?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Military defectors and defectors from any private agency,\r\nafter they return to the U.S. and become civilians. Some have defected\r\nto China, to the satellite nations and to Russia.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Just one other question, because I have to go.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this investigation, as you know so well, there\r\nhave been a number identified who were very close, at least to Mrs.\r\nOswald, and a few, I can't say that were close to Oswald yet they had\r\nassociation with him, such as the man who drove him back and forth,\r\nMrs. Paine, with whom Mrs. Oswald lived, and others, has there been\r\nany credible, I won't say credible because if you had you would have\r\npresented it to us in your report, has there been any claims by persons\r\nthat these people are in any way related to the Communist Party?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We have had no credible evidence that they have been\r\nrelated to the Communist Party in this country.\r\n\r\nNow, as to Mrs. Oswald, the wife of Oswald, there is no way of knowing\r\nwhether she belonged to the Russian Communist Party in Russia. She\r\nis a rather intelligent woman, and notwithstanding that you have to\r\ntalk with her through an interpreter, we have had no indication of her\r\nassociation with Communists in this country, nor have any of her close\r\nfriends or relatives.\r\n\r\nAs to his mother, we found no indication she is associated or closely\r\nassociated with the Communists. She is the only one of the group that\r\nwe have come in contact with that I would say is somewhat emotionally\r\nunstable. Our agents have interviewed her. She sometimes gets very\r\nangry and she won't answer questions. As to the rest of the group who\r\nhad been friends of his, or worked with him in the Texas School Book\r\nDepository, none of them have indicated any Communist associations of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, I hand you Exhibit 863 and ask you to examine\r\nthat and state whether or not that is the letter that you referred\r\nto in which you answered questions of the Commission concerning the\r\nNational Enquirer magazine or newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. This letter of May 8 addressed to the Commission is\r\nthe letter that dealt with our interview with Chief Curry and was\r\npredicated upon the article which appeared in the National Enquirer of\r\nMay 17, 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I ask you if you would care to add anything to that letter\r\nexcept what you have already testified to?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. No; I have nothing to add to that. Chief Curry was very\r\nspecific, I am told by my agent in charge at Dallas, that this article\r\nis an absolute lie; that none of these things set forth in the article\r\noccurred; that he received no phone call or any request of any kind\r\noral or by phone or in writing from the Department of Justice or from\r\nthe FBI. As I stated earlier, the report from the Department of Justice\r\nindicated that they made no request.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Exhibit 863, being the\r\nletter just referred to.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 863 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, is Exhibit 837 the article that you referred to\r\nin the National Enquirer?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes; that is the one.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I call your attention to Exhibit 836 and ask you if that\r\nis the letter that you referred to which describes the criteria in the\r\nhandling of the security of the President that you have described in\r\nyour testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. This is the letter. It sets forth the criteria which were\r\nadopted, originally about 1942 and later incorporated in the manual\r\nof instructions in 1954. It also includes the amended instructions to\r\nour field offices, prepared in December of 1963, which extended the\r\ncriteria.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Does that Exhibit correctly set forth the information you\r\nhad in regard to those matters?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. It does.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you care to add anything to it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. No; I have nothing to add to it at all.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, in light of what happened. Mr. Hoover, I think the\r\nCommission would desire to have your comments or whatever you care\r\nto tell them, concerning the reasons why you did not furnish the\r\ninformation you had concerning Lee Harvey Oswald to the Secret Service\r\nprior to the time of the President's assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Well, I have gone into that very thoroughly because that\r\nwas obviously one of the questions that I had in my mind when the\r\ntragedy occurred in Dallas.\r\n\r\nIn going back over the record, and I have read each one of the reports\r\ndealing with that and the reports of Mr. Hosty who had dealt with\r\nthe Oswald situation largely in Dallas, we had the matter that I\r\nhave previously referred to, the report of the State Department that\r\nindicated this man was a thoroughly safe risk, he had changed his\r\nviews, he was a loyal man now and had seen the light of day, so to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nHow intensive or how extensive that interview in Moscow was, I don't\r\nknow. But, nevertheless, it was in a State Department document that was\r\nfurnished to us.\r\n\r\nNow, we interviewed Oswald a few days after he arrived. We did not\r\ninterview him on arrival at the port of entry because that is always\r\nundesirable by reason of the fact it is heavily covered by press, and\r\nany relatives generally are there, so we prefer to do it after the man\r\nhas settled down for two or three days and become composed. We do it\r\nin the privacy of our office or wherever he may be, or in his own home\r\nor apartment. We interviewed him twice in regard to that angle that we\r\nwere looking for. We had no indication at this time of anything other\r\nthan his so-called Marxist leanings, Marxist beliefs.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to know whether he had been recruited by the Soviet\r\ngovernment as an intelligence agent, which is a frequent and constant\r\npractice. There is not a year goes by but that individuals and groups\r\nof individuals, sometimes on these cultural exchanges, go through\r\nRussia and recruits are enlisted by the Russian intelligence, usually\r\nthrough blackmail. The individual is threatened that if he doesn't come\r\nback to this country and work for them they will expose the fact that\r\nhe is a homosexual or a degenerate or has been indiscrete.\r\n\r\nPictures are usually taken of individuals who become implicated in that\r\nsort of thing, so the individual is really desperate. Such blackmail\r\nhas occurred year after year for some time.\r\n\r\nIn Oswald's case we had no suspicion that any pressure like that had\r\nbeen brought to bear on him because he had gone voluntarily and had\r\nobviously wanted to live in Russia and had married a Russian woman.\r\n\r\nAfter those interviews had been completed, the next incident was the\r\ndifficulty he had at New Orleans. We were concerned there as to whether\r\nhe was functioning officially for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee\r\nwhich was financed and supported by Castro and Castro's government, and\r\nif he was, where he obtained money and with whom he had dealt.\r\n\r\nHe apparently had the leaflets printed himself on plain ordinary paper.\r\nThere was no reason for us, then, to have any suspicion that he had any\r\nelement of danger in him.\r\n\r\nHowever, we did not ignore or forget the fact that he was still in the\r\ncountry. We kept track of him when he went from New Orleans to Dallas,\r\nand that was one of the reasons why Hosty went to the home of Mrs.\r\nPaine. She told us where Oswald was working, at the Texas book house.\r\nHosty gave her his telephone number and his name so that if there was\r\nany information or any contact she wanted to make she could phone him\r\nat the Dallas office.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald, the wife, took down the license number of Hosty's car\r\nwhich was incorrect only in one digit. The name, the telephone number,\r\nand the automobile license were later found in Oswald's memorandum book.\r\n\r\nHowever, that in itself was not significant because many times we will\r\ngo to see a person and tell him now, \"If you think of anything you want\r\nto tell us or you have any information you want to give us, here are my\r\nname and address, telephone number, and call me,\" and that is what was\r\ndone with Mrs. Paine because Hosty wasn't there at the time. He was at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, those items in Oswald's notebook requiring investigative\r\nattention were first set out in an investigative report of our Dallas\r\nOffice dated December 23, 1963. This report was not prepared for this\r\nCommission but rather for investigative purposes of the FBI and,\r\ntherefore, the information concerning Hosty's name, telephone number\r\nand license number was not included in the report as the circumstances\r\nunder which Hosty's name, et cetera, appeared in Oswald's notebook were\r\nfully known to the FBI.\r\n\r\nAfter our investigative report of December 23, 1963, was furnished to\r\nthe Commission, we noted that Agent Hosty's name did not appear in the\r\nreport. In order that there would be a complete reporting of all items\r\nin Oswald's notebook, this information was incorporated in another\r\ninvestigative report of our Dallas Office, dated February 11, 1964.\r\nBoth of the above-mentioned reports were furnished to the Commission\r\nprior to any inquiry concerning this matter by the President's\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any\r\nindication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to\r\nthe President or to the Vice President. Up to that time, as has been\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, may I interrupt, you said Hosty was not there\r\nat the time, he was at work--did you mean Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That was my mistake. I meant Mr. Oswald. Hosty talked with\r\nMrs. Paine and Mrs. Oswald. Mrs. Paine speaks Russian and she could\r\ninterpret for her.\r\n\r\nOswald was at the Texas Book Co., and then, as I say, Hosty left his\r\ntelephone number and name, and Mrs. Oswald for some reason took down\r\nthe license number. I don't know whether she was convinced this was an\r\nagent of the FBI, or why she did it.\r\n\r\nBut, anyway, that was in the book that was later found, and which\r\ncontained many other things that Oswald had entered in the book.\r\n\r\nNow, as I say, up to that time, there had been no information that\r\nwould have warranted our reporting him as a potential danger or hazard\r\nto the security or the safety of the President or the Vice President,\r\nso his name was not furnished at the time to Secret Service.\r\n\r\nUnder the new criteria which we have now put into force and effect,\r\nit would have been furnished because we now include all defectors. As\r\nto the original criteria, which we felt were sound and sufficient and\r\nwhich we felt no one, not even the most extreme civil rights proponent\r\ncould take exception to, we limited the furnishing of names to S.S.\r\nto persons potentially dangerous to the physical well being of the\r\nPresident. We included emotionally unstable people who had threatened\r\nthe President or Vice President.\r\n\r\nAt my office during the course of a week there are sometimes three or\r\nfour callers who have to be taken to a Hospital because of their mental\r\ncondition. They claim they are being persecuted by radio beams and they\r\nwant to see me or the President to have those beams stopped. Now you\r\nnever know what tangent they are going to take. If such a person is\r\nliving in some part of the country where the President may be going his\r\nname would be furnished to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nOne car last year, I think, crashed through the gates of the White\r\nHouse; the person driving wanted to see the President. The guard\r\nwouldn't let him in and so the car crashed through and got within 20\r\nfeet of the first door. The guards, by that time, had their revolvers\r\nout and took him into custody.\r\n\r\nLast year a gentleman drove all the way from Arizona to see me. He\r\ndrove up the marble steps of the Department of Justice, and by that\r\ntime the guards had come out and took him into custody. I think he was\r\nincarcerated in Arizona.\r\n\r\nPeople of this type are among those we would have furnished to the\r\nSecret Service. They have the potential to harm somebody.\r\n\r\nWe get names from members of Congress, of people who come to the\r\nCapitol and try to threaten them or harass them. They let us know about\r\nit, and we make the investigation or advise the police. If we can get\r\nthe family to have the person put into an institution, we try to do so.\r\nIf they don't, we may take steps to have him incarcerated through other\r\nlegal means.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How many names, Mr. Director, in general, could the Secret\r\nService process? Aren't their facilities limited as to dealing with\r\nvast numbers of names because of their limited personnel?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I think they are extremely limited. The Secret Service is a\r\nvery small organization and that is why we are fortifying them, so to\r\nspeak, or supplementing them by assigning agents of our Bureau which\r\nis, of course, quite a burden on us. Our agents are assigned about 24\r\nto 25 cases per agent and cover such involved matters as bankruptcy and\r\nantitrust cases.\r\n\r\nNow, the Secret Service has a very small group and I would estimate\r\nthat the names we have sent over number some 5,000. I would guess there\r\nare about another 4,000 that will go over in the next month to them.\r\nFrankly, I don't see how they can go out and recheck those names. We\r\nkeep the records up to date; if additional information comes in on\r\nthese names we furnish it to the Secret Service. They will have to call\r\nupon the local authorities, unless the Secret Service force is enlarged\r\nconsiderably so that they can handle it entirely on their own. I think\r\nthe Secret Service is entirely too small a force today to handle the\r\nduties that they are handling. The great crowds that are at the White\r\nHouse all the time, around the gates, that go to church where the\r\nPresident goes, all of those things, of course, have to be checked over\r\nby them. They always check in advance and just recently, a few Sundays\r\nago, they found some individuals in the basement of St. Mark's church\r\nin Washington, where he was going to attend on Sunday morning. His\r\narrival was held up until they could ascertain who they were. They were\r\ndeaf mutes whose identity had not been cleared with the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nNow, the Presidential party was delayed about 5 or 10 minutes in\r\nreaching the church by reason of the radio call to the White House to\r\nhold it up.\r\n\r\nWe are giving to Secret Service more and more names. The total, in\r\naddition to the names they already had, will reach 10,000. I don't see\r\nhow they are going to be able to handle the situation as they would\r\nwant to handle it. They have to depend upon local police organizations.\r\nMany local police departments are capable and efficient; some are\r\nnot. Many have good judgment and some have not. Wherever you have a\r\npolice department of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 men you are bound to find\r\na few who will just barge in and do something which better judgment\r\nwould dictate should not be done, as in the incident which occurred in\r\nthe Midwest where they placed people practically under house arrest.\r\nI think it was very bad judgment and should not have been done but\r\nthe Secret Service, of course, turned the names over to the local\r\nauthorities, and the local authorities do what they think is right.\r\n\r\nNow, I guess their attitude with all justice to them is. \"Well, we\r\nwill resolve the risk in our favor. If we keep these people under\r\nsurveillance and keep them in the house until the President gets out\r\nof town nothing can happen from them.\" That is what you would call\r\ntotalitarian security. I don't think you can have that kind of security\r\nin this country without having a great wave of criticism against it.\r\nThere is a great tendency for people to expect the intelligence forces\r\nand the law enforcement agencies to be able to go out and arrest\r\npeople and bring them in and hold them endlessly and talk to them. We\r\ncan't arrest a person, without probable cause, or unless he commits a\r\ncrime in our presence. We have to arraign him promptly and if not done\r\npromptly, the confession that he may have made generally cannot be used\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nJust as a collateral matter we faced that problem in California in the\r\ncase of the kidnapping of Frank Sinatra, Jr. One of the kidnappers we\r\narrested near San Diego confessed but we didn't arraign him because\r\nthe other kidnappers would have left California and it would have been\r\ndifficult to find them. However, the next day after arraignment he made\r\nchanges in the confession and signed it so the court held that it was\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service, of course, is faced with the same problem. They\r\njust can't arrest people because they may not like their looks. They\r\nhave to have facts justifying detention but the public conception is\r\nthat you have a full right to go out and do these things. We have\r\nstressed in the FBI that there must be full compliance with the laws of\r\nthis country and with the decisions of the Supreme Court. That is the\r\nlaw of the country. Now, whether a person likes it or not and there are\r\nsome groups that are very violent against the decisions of the court\r\nwhile others are very much in favor of them, it is not for the FBI to\r\ntake sides. We have a job to do and we do it under the rulings of the\r\ncourts and we have been able to do it effectively.\r\n\r\nI know when the ruling came down on the prompt arraignment, there\r\nwas great shouting and some strong editorials claiming that it was\r\ngoing to wreck law enforcement. It hasn't wrecked us. It has made it\r\nmore difficult but I think we have to face up to the fact that law\r\nenforcement in a free country must abide by the laws of that country\r\nirrespective of how difficult it is. Some persons talk about putting\r\nhandcuffs on the law enforcement officers and taking them off the\r\ncriminals. That is a nice catch phrase to use in a speech or article\r\nbut operating within the law has not interfered with our work.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, I ask you about Exhibit 825 which is first a\r\nletter and then encloses certain affidavits of your agents.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You are familiar with that?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I am familiar with that. I read all of that and signed it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know those are the affidavits in regard to whether Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald was an agent or connected in anyway with the Bureau that\r\nyou have just testified to?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct; and the affidavits of all agents, who had\r\nany contact with him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I call your attention to Exhibits 864 and 865, and ask you\r\nif you have seen those before or, you have seen the original of 864 and\r\n865 is a photostatic copy of your letter to us in answer to 864, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct; yes. I recall very distinctly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall those letters involved an inquiry as to any\r\nconnections of Lee Harvey Oswald with Communists or any criminal groups\r\nor others that might be conspiratorial?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct; and my letter of April 30 states the facts\r\nas they are in our files.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, we offer in evidence Exhibits 864 and 865.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit Nos. 864 and 865 were marked for identification and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, do you have any suggestions that you would\r\nlike to tell the Commission about of your ideas that might improve\r\nthe security of the President, and you might comment upon information\r\nthe Commission has received. You have a special appropriation that is\r\nrelated to that area.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Well, I, at the request of----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Director, before you get into that question, and may\r\nI ask something that I would like to hear you discuss in this same\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You have told us that you had no jurisdiction down there\r\nin Dallas over this crime.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That is correct.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Because there is no Federal crime committed. And I assume\r\nthat that caused you some embarrassment and some confusion in doing\r\nyour work?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. It most certainly did.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Because of the likelihood of your being in conflict with\r\nother authorities. Do you believe there should be a Federal law?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I am very strongly in favor of that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Against an attempt to assassinate the President?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I am very strongly in favor of legislation being enacted\r\nand enacted promptly that will make a Federal crime of attempts upon\r\nthe life of the President and the Vice President, and possibly the next\r\ntwo persons in succession, the Speaker and the President pro tempore\r\nof the Senate. In the Oswald case, we could not take custody of him.\r\nIf we had had jurisdiction we would have taken custody of him and I\r\ndo not believe he would have been killed by Rubenstein. The failure\r\nto have jurisdiction was extremely embarrassing. I think the killing\r\nof Oswald has created a great fog of speculation that will go on for\r\nyears, because of the things that Oswald might have been able to tell\r\nwhich would have been of assistance in pinning down various phases of\r\nthis matter. This must be done now by collecting evidence from third\r\nparties, and not from Oswald himself.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the publicity that took place in Dallas, I was very\r\nmuch concerned with that. We have in the FBI a crime laboratory\r\nthat furnishes free service to all law enforcement agencies of the\r\ncountry. Any law enforcement agency can send to our laboratory here\r\nin Washington any evidence--blood, dirt, dust, guns, anything of\r\nthat kind--and our laboratory examines it and then reports back to\r\nthe contributing police department. This was being done in the early\r\nstages of the Oswald case, and almost as soon as the report would\r\nreach the Dallas Police Department, the chief of police or one of the\r\nrepresentatives of the department would go on TV or radio and relate\r\nfindings of the FBI, giving information such as the identification of\r\nthe gun and other items of physical evidence.\r\n\r\nNow, that concerned me for several reasons. In the first place, I don't\r\nthink cases should be tried in the newspapers. I think a short and\r\nsimple statement can be made when a person is arrested, but the details\r\nof the evidence should be retained until you go into court to try the\r\ncase. Secondly, it creates a great deal of speculation on the part of\r\nthe press. There was very aggressive press coverage at Dallas. I was\r\nso concerned that I asked my agent in charge at Dallas, Mr. Shanklin,\r\nto personally go to Chief Curry and tell him that I insisted that he\r\nnot go on the air any more until this case was resolved. Until all\r\nthe evidence had been examined, I did not want any statements made\r\nconcerning the progress of the investigation. Because of the fact the\r\nPresident had asked me to take charge of the case I insisted that he\r\nand all members of his department refrain from public statements.\r\n\r\nThere was an officer in his department who was constantly on the\r\nradio or giving out interviews. The chief concurred in my request and\r\nthereafter refrained from further comment but of course by that time\r\nthe identification of the gun was known, the caliber of the gun, where\r\nit had come from, where it had been bought and the information we had\r\nrun down in Chicago and had furnished to the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nIf the case had been in the hands of the FBI none of that information\r\nwould have been given out. Because of the publicity you had to face the\r\ncharge that the prejudice of the community would require a change of\r\nvenue. With the publicity, I don't know where you could have changed\r\nthe venue to, since newspapers all over the State covered it. I think\r\na Houston reporter was the first one who wrote that Oswald was an\r\ninformant of the FBI. We went to the newspaper reporter. He refused to\r\ntell us his source. He said he had also heard it from other persons.\r\nWe asked him the names of these persons and we interviewed them but\r\nnone of them would provide the source. In other words, I was trying\r\nto nail down where this lie started. That, of course, is always the\r\nresult where you are daily giving out press interviews because the\r\npress wants stories desperately. We have always adopted the policy in\r\nthe Bureau of no comment until we have the warrant and make the arrest.\r\nThen a release is prepared briefly stating what the facts are, what\r\nthe written complaint says, the fact. The complaint was filed with the\r\nCommissioner, and that ends it. We don't try to run it out for a week\r\nor 10 days. It is up to the U.S. attorney thereafter and the court to\r\ntry the case.\r\n\r\nI was concerned about the demand for change of venue, because all the\r\nevidence was being given out. At that time, of course, we didn't know\r\nthat Oswald was going to be killed, and there was a possibility that\r\nhe might be confronted with some of this evidence. If it had been kept\r\nsecret and used in the interrogation of him, just confronting him\r\nwith what was found, such as his picture with the gun might have been\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nA small thing can often make a man break and come forward with a full\r\nconfession. If he knows in advance that you have certain evidence he\r\nwill be on guard against answering questions. Of course, he is always\r\nadvised of his rights and that he can have an attorney. We always\r\nmake a point of this. We generally have a reputable physician of\r\nthe community present in our office while the prisoner is there, to\r\nadminister to him and be able to testify that he has not been subjected\r\nto third degree methods. He is examined when he comes in and he is\r\nexamined before we take him to the commissioner. Taking him before the\r\ncommissioner in a case like Oswald's would probably have been done\r\nwithin 4 or 5 hours. Generally we try to arraign a prisoner within an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThat makes it more difficult; you have to work faster. But again I say\r\nI am in favor of having the procedures of law enforcement officers as\r\ntightly bound down as we can, with due respect for the interests of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nOf course, there must be an equal balance. For years we have had a rule\r\nagainst third degree methods, but years ago many police departments\r\nused the third degree. I think very few of them use it now because if\r\nthey use it they violate the civil rights statutes and we investigate\r\nthem for having brutally handled a prisoner. Many allegations are made\r\nunfairly against police officers that they have used third degree\r\nmethods and we are able to prove they haven't in our investigations.\r\nThat is particularly true where civil rights matters are involved. We\r\nhave such cases in many areas where civil rights agitation is going on.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, to remind you of my question, any suggestions\r\nthat you may have concerning the protection of the President, and\r\nthe information that the Commission has that you have a special\r\nappropriation in that connection for the Bureau?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. We do not have a special appropriation for the\r\nprotection of the President. The Secret Service, of course, has that\r\nresponsibility. On December 2, I prepared this memorandum for the\r\nPresident, and for the chief of the Secret Service at the request of\r\nthe President, outlining suggestions that I felt should be considered\r\nto tighten up on the security of the President. If the Commission\r\ndesires I will be glad to leave this or I will be glad to read it to\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Why don't you ask the Director just to summarize\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you summarize it?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can we have a copy of it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could the copy be put in the record as an exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir; that is all right with me. I have no objection to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRegarding travel, first, advise the Secret Service as far in advance as\r\npossible of the President's travel plans and proposed itinerary. The\r\nreason for that is there have been Presidents who suddenly decide they\r\nare going somewhere and the Secret Service does not have the chance\r\nalways to cover the area and check the neighborhood and check the hotel\r\nor place where it may be.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You have one like that right now, Mr. Director.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I know from experience.\r\n\r\nSecond, avoid publicizing exact routes of travel as long as possible.\r\nAgain, it has been the practice in the past to announce the President\r\nis going along a certain route and, therefore, great crowds will gather\r\nalong that route. And, therefore, I thought that was something that\r\nshould not be given out and the President should be taken along some\r\nroutes which are not announced. At the present time, he goes to cities\r\nand he wants to see people and the crowd wants to see him. In Dallas,\r\nthe route was publicized at least 24 hours before so everybody knew\r\nwhere he would be driving.\r\n\r\nThird, use a specially armored car with bulletproof glass and have such\r\ncars readily available in locations frequently visited. The President,\r\nas I observed earlier in my testimony, had no armored car. He has one\r\nnow which I supplied to Secret Service and they will have one made no\r\ndoubt in due time for the President's use. But if it had been armored,\r\nI believe President Kennedy would be alive today.\r\n\r\nFourth, avoid setting a specific pattern of travel or other activity\r\nsuch as visiting the same church at the same time each Sunday.\r\n\r\nRegarding public appearances. First, use maximum feasible screening of\r\npersons in attendance including use of detection devices sensitive to\r\nthe amount of metal required in a firearm or grenade.\r\n\r\nSecond, use a bulletproof shield in front of the entire rostrum in\r\npublic appearances such as the swearing in ceremony at the Capitol on\r\ninauguration day, the presidential reviewing stand in front of the\r\nWhite House on the same day and on the rear of trains.\r\n\r\nThird, keep to a minimum the President's movements within crowds,\r\nremain on the rostrum after the public addresses rather than mingling\r\nwith the audience. Again, there is great difficulty in that field.\r\n\r\nFourth, in appearances at public sporting events such as football\r\ngames, remain in one place rather than changing sides during half-time\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. About the armored car you said if Kennedy had an armored\r\ncar that might have saved him. Would the back of the armored car have\r\nsome protection to protect his head?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Because if the armored car had been open----\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. He must never ride in an open car; that has been my\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The back never comes down?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. The back never comes down, and it is bulletproof. The top,\r\nsides, and underpart are all of bulletproof construction. So that\r\nexcept by opening a window and waving through the window the occupant\r\nis safe. A person can shoot through the window if the glass window is\r\nlowered.\r\n\r\nFifth, limit public appearances by use of television whenever possible.\r\n\r\nSixth, avoid walking in public except when absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nNow, on legislation. First, I recommended that the President and the\r\nVice President be added to the list of Federal officers set out in\r\nsection 1114, title 18 of the U.S. Code which deals with assaults which\r\nare punishable under Federal law.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You would add to that I understood from your prior remarks,\r\nthe Speaker and the President Pro Tempore?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. In view of the situation which prevails at the present time\r\nthe Speaker and President pro tempore, in other words, the line of\r\nsuccession under the Constitution but not below that.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Second, furnish the Secret Service authority to request\r\nassistance and cooperation from other U.S. agencies including the\r\nmilitary, particularly in connection with foreign travel.\r\n\r\nNow, my reason for that is that sometimes requests for assistance have\r\nto clear through red-tape channels here at Washington through some\r\nhigh official of Government. If an emergency arises abroad, or even in\r\nthis country, it may be of such character that you do not have time to\r\ntelephone back to Washington or to telephone back to the Pentagon. Aid\r\nought to be immediately available by calling on the local authorities\r\nand the nearest military authority.\r\n\r\nThird, improve control of the sale of firearms requiring as a\r\nminimum registration of every firearm sold together with adequate\r\nidentification of the purchaser. The problem of firearms control is\r\nunder extensive debate, in both the House and Senate at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe gun that Oswald used was bought by mail order from a mail-order\r\nhouse in Chicago, no license for it, no permit for it, no checkup on\r\nit. The only way we were able to trace it was to find out where in this\r\ncountry that Italian-made gun was sold. We found the company in Chicago\r\nand later the mail-order slip that had been sent by Oswald to Chicago\r\nto get the gun. Now, there are arguments, of course----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In a false name.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. In a false name.\r\n\r\nThere is argument, of course, that by passing firearms legislation you\r\nare going to take the privilege of hunting away from the sportsmen of\r\nthe country. I don't share that view with any great degree of sympathy\r\nbecause you have to get a license to drive an automobile and you have\r\nto get a license to have a dog, and I see no reason why a man shouldn't\r\nbe willing, if he is a law-abiding citizen, to have a license to get a\r\nfirearm whether it be a rifle or revolver or other firearm.\r\n\r\nIt is not going to curtail his exercise of shooting for sport because\r\nthe police make a check of his background. If he is a man who is\r\nentitled to a gun, a law-abiding citizen, a permit will be granted.\r\n\r\nOf course, today firearms control is practically negligible, and I\r\nthink some steps should be taken along that line.\r\n\r\nFourth, a ban on picketing within the vicinity of the White House as is\r\nnow done at the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court. Some of these pickets\r\nare well-meaning and law-abiding individuals, some are for peace and\r\nsome are more or less dedicated Communists.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. It is illegal to picket a Federal court now, Mr.\r\nDirector, I happen to be the author of that law.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes; I am glad you had that law passed. Of course, they\r\npicket public buildings, they march around the Department of Justice\r\nBuilding, now and then, but the principal places they prefer to go are\r\nthe Supreme Court Building, the Capitol and its grounds and the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nI think such picketing at the White House, of large or small groups,\r\nshould be forbidden. I think at the White House they tried to get\r\nthe pickets to walk across the street along Lafayette Park. That at\r\nleast takes them away from being close to the gates at the White\r\nHouse. I think there ought to be some control. Picketing, of course,\r\nis legitimate if it is orderly. Many times it doesn't continue to be\r\norderly, and sometimes pickets, as in this city, have thrown themselves\r\non the pavement and the police have to come and pick them up or drag\r\nthem away. Then, of course, the charge is made of brutality right away.\r\n\r\nDelegations of colored groups have visited me and asked why I don't\r\narrest a police officer for hitting some Negro whom he is arresting in\r\na sit-in strike, lay-in strike or demonstration in some southern cities.\r\n\r\nWe have no authority to make an arrest of that kind. Under the\r\nauthority the Bureau has we have to submit those complaints to the\r\nDepartment of Justice and if they authorize us to make an arrest we\r\nwill do it.\r\n\r\nThose in general are the recommendations I made and I will furnish the\r\ncommittee with a copy of this memorandum.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Hoover, I would like to ask you in regard to your\r\nrecommendations, do you think you have adequately taken into account\r\nthat the President is not only the Chief Executive but also necessarily\r\na politician under our system?\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I have taken that into account, and I would like to say\r\nthis off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Any other questions, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I would just like to thank the Director again for\r\nall the help he has given us.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I am happy to.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I would, too, on behalf of the Commission, Mr. Director,\r\nI would not only like to thank you for your testimony but for your\r\ncooperation that your people have given us throughout this entire\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I also want to add one other thing, having in mind the\r\ntestimony you gave that this is still an open investigation, that\r\nshould anything come to your attention that you believe this Commission\r\nhas either overlooked or should look into you feel free to ask us to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I would most certainly do that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You do it.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I want to give all the cooperation I can to this most\r\ndifficult task you have.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. One question. The other day when we had the State,\r\nJustice, Judiciary Appropriation bill before the full Committee on\r\nAppropriations----\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And I am not a member of that subcommittee, I\r\nnoticed a provision in the bill, as I recall, to the effect funds\r\nfor or something of that content, of FBI responsibilities for the\r\nprotection of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. There is a provision for funds that we can use for the\r\napprehension of a man who has been declared a fugitive from justice,\r\nthat is where a man has committed a crime, a warrant is out for him and\r\nhe has fled or where he has escaped from a penitentiary. I don't recall\r\noffhand any specific appropriation for the protection of the President.\r\nI will look at the appropriation bill. I may be wrong there but I am\r\nquite certain that is so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It was my recollection as I was looking at the\r\nbill in committee there was a phrase to this effect in the language of\r\nthe bill. I think it might be helpful for the record to get whatever\r\nthe history is of that if it is still a matter of the bill or the law.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I remember that at the time Mr. Curtis was Vice President,\r\nhe was Senator and then Vice President, at that time he insisted that\r\nhe wanted FBI agents with him and nobody else. When Mr. Nixon took\r\noffice as Vice President he was protected by the Secret Service and\r\nwith Mr. Johnson, it was the same thing.\r\n\r\nSecret Service asked us to let them have additional manpower, as a\r\nmatter of assistance, and we have done so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be helpful if you would have a\r\nmemorandum prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. I will be glad to.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Showing the history of this provision from its\r\ninception and whether or not it is in the bill or the proposed law for\r\nfiscal 1965.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the justification you have indicated.\r\n\r\nMr. HOOVER. That was not taken up, I know, in the testimony before the\r\nAppropriations Committee. I gave the testimony before the committee in\r\nJanuary, and the testimony wasn't released until 2 weeks ago when the\r\nbill was reported out. It was not discussed in the hearings.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, in order to complete the record, may I ask\r\nto have the number 866 assigned to the memo that Mr. Hoover is going\r\nto send about protection of the President, and have it admitted to this\r\nrecord under that number.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; it may be.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Also a number for this letter Mr. Hoover is going\r\nto submit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. May I assign 867?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit Nos. 866 and 867 were marked for identification and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOHN A. McCONE AND RICHARD M. HELMS\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nDirector McCone, it is customary for the Chairman to make a short\r\nstatement to the witness as to the testimony that is expected to be\r\ngiven. I will read it at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. McCone will be asked to testify on whether Lee Harvey Oswald was\r\never an agent, directly or indirectly, or an informer or acting on\r\nbehalf of the Central Intelligence Agency in any capacity at any time,\r\nand whether he knows of any credible evidence or of any conspiracy\r\neither domestic or foreign involved in the assassination of President\r\nKennedy, also with regard to any suggestions and recommendations he\r\nmay have concerning improvements or changes in provisions for the\r\nprotection of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nWould you please rise and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear the testimony\r\nyou are about to give before this Commission shall be the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please? Mr. Rankin will conduct the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, will you state your name?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. My name is John Alex McCone.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have an official position with the U.S. Government?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes, sir; I am Director of Central Intelligence.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you been Director for some time?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; a little over 2-1/2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live, Mr. McCone?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I live at 3025 Whitehaven Street in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you familiar with the records and how they are kept by\r\nthe Central Intelligence Agency as to whether a man is acting as an\r\ninformer, agent, employee, or in any other capacity for that Agency?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; I am generally familiar with the procedures and the\r\nrecords that are maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency. Quite\r\nnaturally, I am not familiar with all of the records because they are\r\nvery extensive.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you determined whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald, the\r\nsuspect in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy,\r\nhad any connection with the Central Intelligence Agency, informer or\r\nindirectly as an employee, or any other capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; I have determined to my satisfaction that he had no\r\nsuch connection, and I would like to read for the record----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us briefly the extent of your inquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. In a form of affidavit, I have gone into the matter in\r\nconsiderable detail personally, in my inquiry with the appropriate\r\npeople within the Agency, examined all records in our files relating to\r\nLee Harvey Oswald. We had knowledge of him, of course, because of his\r\nhaving gone to the Soviet Union, as he did, putting him in a situation\r\nwhere his name would appear in our name file. However, my examination\r\nhas resulted in the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was not an agent,\r\nemployee, or informant of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Agency\r\nnever contacted him, interviewed him, talked with him, or received or\r\nsolicited any reports or information from him, or communicated with\r\nhim directly or in any other manner. The Agency never furnished him\r\nwith any funds or money or compensated him directly or indirectly in\r\nany fashion, and Lee Harvey Oswald was never associated or connected\r\ndirectly or indirectly in any way whatsoever with the Agency. When\r\nI use the term \"Agency,\" I mean the Central Intelligence Agency, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Does that include whether or not he was in the\r\nUnited States, in the Soviet Union, or anyplace?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Anyplace; the United States, Soviet Union, or anyplace.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, is that the affidavit you are going to supply\r\nthe Commission in connection with our request for it?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; this is the substance of the affidavit which I will\r\nsupply to you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I ask leave to mark that Exhibit 870 and have\r\nit introduced in evidence as soon as we receive it from Mr. McCone as a\r\npart of this record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 870 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell us about your procedures in regard to having\r\nan agent or informer or any person acting in that type of capacity?\r\nDoes that have to pass through your hands or come to your attention in\r\nthe Agency?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No; it does not have to come through my personal hands.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Without disclosing something that might be a security\r\nmatter, could you tell us how that is handled in a general way in the\r\nAgency?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Mr. Helms, who is directly responsible for that division of\r\nthe Agency's activities as a Deputy Director, might explain. Would that\r\nbe permissible?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could we have him sworn then?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn. Do you\r\nsolemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before this\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms, you heard the inquiry just directed to Mr.\r\nMcCone. Could you answer the question directly?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Yes; we have a specific procedure which we follow in all\r\ncases where the Agency is in contact, for the purposes of acquiring\r\nintelligence or whatever the case may be, with an individual. We not\r\nonly have a record of the individual's name, but we also usually get\r\ninformation of a biographical nature. We then check this individual's\r\nname against our record. At that point we make a determination as to\r\nwhether we desire to use this man or not to use him. It varies from\r\ncase to case as to how many officers may be involved in approving a\r\nspecific recruitment. May I go off the record?\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms, did you have anything to do on behalf of your\r\nAgency with determining whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was acting in\r\nany of the capacities I have described in my questions to Mr. McCone?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us what you did in that regard?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. On Mr. McCone's behalf, I had all of our records searched\r\nto see if there had been any contacts at any time prior to President\r\nKennedy's assassination by anyone in the Central Intelligence Agency\r\nwith Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our card files and our personnel\r\nfiles and all our records.\r\n\r\nNow, this check turned out to be negative. In addition I got in touch\r\nwith those officers who were in positions of responsibility at the\r\ntimes in question to see if anybody had any recollection of any contact\r\nhaving even been suggested with this man. This also turned out to be\r\nnegative, so there is no material in the Central Intelligence Agency,\r\neither in the records or in the mind of any of the individuals, that\r\nthere was any contact had or even contemplated with him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there? Do you recall or do you\r\nknow at what time the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was carded, first came\r\nto your attention so it became a matter of record, in the Agency?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Sir, I would want to consult the record to be absolutely\r\naccurate, but it is my impression that the first time that his name\r\nshowed up on any Agency records was when he went to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms, in connection with your work you have supplied\r\ninformation to the Commission and we have requested many things from\r\nyour Agency. Can you tell the Commission as to whether or not you have\r\nsupplied us all the information the Agency has, at least in substance,\r\nin regard to Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. We have; all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Has a member of the Commission staff had full\r\naccess to your files on Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. He has, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. They have had the opportunity to personally look\r\nat the entire file?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. We invited them to come out to our building in Langley and\r\nactually put the file on the table so that they could examine it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I was personally out there, too, and was offered the same\r\nopportunity. I did not avail myself of it because of the time element,\r\nbut I was offered the same opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms, can you explain, according to the limitations of\r\nsecurity, the reasons why we examined materials but did not always take\r\nthem, in a general way?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Yes; I can.\r\n\r\nIn our communications between individuals working overseas and in\r\nWashington, we for security reasons have a method of hiding the\r\nidentities of individuals in telegrams and dispatches by the use of\r\npseudonyms and cryptonyms. For this reason, we never allow the original\r\ndocuments to leave our premises. However, on the occasion when the\r\nrepresentatives of the Commission staff looked at these files, we sat\r\nthere and identified these pseudonyms and cryptonyms and related them\r\nto the proper names of the individuals concerned, so that they would\r\nknow exactly what the correspondence said.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By that you mean the representatives of the Commission were\r\nable to satisfy themselves that they had all of the information for the\r\nbenefit of the Commission without disclosing matters that would be a\r\nthreat to security; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. It is my understanding that they were satisfied.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. McCone, do you have full authority from higher\r\nauthority to make full disclosure to this Commission of any information\r\nin the files of the Central Intelligence Agency?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is right. It is my understanding that it is the desire\r\nof higher authority that this Commission shall have access to all\r\ninformation of every nature in our files or in the minds of employees\r\nof Central Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the basis of that authority, you or the Agency\r\nhave made a full disclosure?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Helms, I have handed you Exhibits 868 and 869 directed\r\nto you acting for the Agency, the first one being from the Commission\r\nto you and the second one, 869, being your answer in regard to your\r\nfull and complete disclosure in regard to your records; isn't that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. That is correct. May I say, Mr. Rankin, that any\r\ninformation, though, subsequent to this correspondence which we may\r\nobtain we will certainly continue to forward to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask leave to have those two\r\nexhibits, 868 and 869, received in evidence at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 868 and 869 were marked for identification\r\nand received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, if I may return to you, I will now ask you if\r\nyou have any credible information that you know of or evidence causing\r\nyou to believe that there is any or was any conspiracy either domestic\r\nor foreign in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No; I have no information, Mr. Rankin, that would lead me\r\nto believe or conclude that a conspiracy existed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the CIA make an investigation of this aspect\r\nof the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. We made an investigation of all developments after the\r\nassassination which came to our attention which might possibly have\r\nindicated a conspiracy, and we determined after these investigations,\r\nwhich were made promptly and immediately, that we had no evidence to\r\nsupport such an assumption.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the Central Intelligence Agency have any\r\ncontact with Oswald during the period of his life in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No; not to my knowledge, nor to the knowledge of those who\r\nwould have been in a position to have made such contact, nor according\r\nto any record we have.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the Central Intelligence Agency have any\r\npersonal contact with Oswald subsequent to his return to the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, your Agency made a particular investigation in\r\nconnection with any allegations about a conspiracy involving the Soviet\r\nUnion or people connected with Cuba, did you not?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes, we did. We made a thorough, a very thorough,\r\ninvestigation of information that came to us concerning an alleged\r\ntrip that Oswald made to Mexico City during which time he made contact\r\nwith the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt to gain transit\r\nprivileges from Mexico City to the Soviet Union via Havana. We\r\ninvestigated that thoroughly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you also include in your statement that you found no\r\nevidence of conspiracy in all of that investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And also the investigation you made of the period that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald was in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there? Does your answer, Mr.\r\nMcCone, include a negation of any belief that Oswald was working for or\r\non behalf of the Soviet Union at any time when you were in contact with\r\nhim or knew about his activities?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. As I have already stated, we were never in contact with\r\nOswald. We have no evidence that he was working for or on behalf of the\r\nSoviet Union at any time. According to his diary, Oswald did receive a\r\nsubsidy from the Soviet Red Cross which we assume had the approval of\r\nthe authorities. Such a payment does not indicate to us that he even\r\nworked for the Soviet intelligence services. Furthermore, we have no\r\nother evidence that he ever worked for Soviet intelligence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is the Central Intelligence Agency continuing any\r\ninvestigation into this area?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No, because, at the present time, we have no information in\r\nour files that we have not exhaustively investigated and disposed of to\r\nour satisfaction. Naturally, any new information that might come into\r\nour hands would be investigated promptly.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. I simply wanted to add that we obviously are interested in\r\nanything we can pick up applying to this case, and anything we get will\r\nbe immediately sent to the Commission, so that we haven't stopped our\r\ninquiries or the picking up of any information we can from people who\r\nmight have it. This is on a continuing basis.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, the case isn't closed.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. It is not closed as far as we are concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would that be true, Mr. Helms, even after the Commission\r\ncompleted its report, you would keep the matter open if there was\r\nanything new that developed in the future that could be properly\r\npresented to the authorities?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Yes. I would assume the case will never be closed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, do you have any ideas about improving the\r\nsecurity provisions for the President that you would like to relate to\r\nthe Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, this is, in my opinion, a very important question\r\nwhich I am sure this Commission will--has and will--devote a\r\nconsiderable amount of thought to, and undoubtedly have some\r\nrecommendations as part of its report.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Your Agency does have an important function in some aspects.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. We have a very important function in connection with the\r\nforeign travels of the President, and I would like to inform the\r\nCommission as to how we discharge that responsibility by quickly\r\nreviewing the chronology of the Central Intelligence Agency's support\r\nof President Kennedy's visit to Mexico City from the 29th of June to\r\nthe 2d of July 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you please do that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Director, is that a security matter?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. No. I think I can handle this for the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. If I have to make a remark or two off the record I will ask\r\nthat privilege.\r\n\r\nThat visit, as I said, started on the 29th of June. On the 28th of\r\nApril, in anticipation of the visit, instructions were transmitted to\r\nMexico for the Ambassador to coordinate planning and informational\r\nguidance for the advance party of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nWe asked that the Secret Service be given information on local groups\r\nand persons who would cause disturbances, embarrassments or physical\r\nharm, an estimate of the determination and ability of the Mexican\r\ngovernment to prevent incidents, and preparation for special briefings\r\nto the Embassy officials and the Secret Service, and such additional\r\nsupport and communications personnel that might be required.\r\n\r\nThese instructions were given two months before the trip.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, we received confirmed information that the\r\nPresident would visit Mexico on the specific dates. On the 1st of June\r\nthe Secret Service was supplied by the Agency with the detailed survey\r\nof Mexican security forces that would be called upon to protect the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nFriendly and allied governments were informed of the visit and their\r\ncooperation and pertinent informational support was solicited. From\r\nthis date through the 2d of July daily information reports were\r\nfurnished to the State Department, the Secret Service, the FBI and the\r\nmilitary services.\r\n\r\nThat is from the 1st of June to the 2d of July, a period of 31,\r\n32 days. On the 8th of June the Secret Service advance party was\r\nbriefed in detail by a group of officers of the Agency on the Mexican\r\ngovernment's plans for the protection of the President, including\r\ncurrent information on the size, strength and capabilities of potential\r\ntroublemakers.\r\n\r\nHazardous locations and times in the planned itinerary were identified,\r\npolitical and economic issues that might be invoked by hostile elements\r\nfor demonstrations were specified.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June, the Secret Service advance party left for Mexico\r\nsupported by additional security personnel to assist in coordinating an\r\ninformational report and the followup activity required.\r\n\r\nEspecially prepared national intelligence estimates on the current\r\nsecurity conditions in Mexico was approved by the United States\r\nIntelligence Board on the 13th of June.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June arrangements were completed to reenforce\r\ncommunications facilities. On the 24th of June a conference at the\r\nState Department was held at the request of the President for reviewing\r\nsecurity measures, and this meeting I attended personally, and reported\r\nto the State Department on the essence of all that had gone before.\r\n\r\nEmergency contingency plans were discussed and a consensus was reached\r\nthat the President should make the visit as scheduled.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June, a final updated special national intelligence\r\nestimate was prepared, and this indicated no basic changes in the\r\nsecurity assessment that Mexican government was prepared to cope with\r\nforeseeable security contingencies.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, a final briefing report was prepared for the\r\nDirector's use which indicated the security precautions of the Mexican\r\ngovernment had effectively forestalled major organized incidents, and\r\nour informed estimate was that the President would receive a great\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe report was presented to the President personally by the Director at\r\nnoon in a final meeting prior to departure on this trip.\r\n\r\nFrom the 29th of June to the 2d of July in Washington headquarters,\r\nheadquarters components remained on a 24-hour alert for close support\r\nof the embassy and the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nSo, not only was the Central Intelligence Agency and its various\r\ncomponents involved in this for a period of 2 months in close\r\ncollaboration with the Secret Service, but by bringing in the United\r\nStates Intelligence Board we brought in all of the intelligence assets\r\nof the United States Government in connection with this particular\r\ntrip. I thought this procedure which is followed regularly on all trips\r\nthat the President makes out of the country would be of interest to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is the normal format of your procedures?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When the President goes abroad?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes, I selected this one. The same was true of his trip to\r\nCaracas or Paris or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, in your investigation of the Oswald matter\r\ndid you use the same approach or a comparable approach to a liaison\r\nwith the other intelligence agencies of government to try to discover\r\nanything that might involve your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes. We were in very close touch with the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation and with the Secret Service on a 24-hour basis at all\r\npoints, both domestic and foreign, where information had been received\r\nwhich might have a bearing on this problem.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have an opinion, Mr. McCone, as to whether or not\r\nthe liaison between the intelligence agencies of the United States\r\nGovernment might be improved if they had better mechanical, computer or\r\nother facilities of that type, and also some other ideas or methods of\r\ndealing with each other?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. There is a great deal of improvement of information that\r\nmight be of importance in a matter of this kind through the use of\r\ncomputers and mechanical means of handling files, and you, Mr. Chief\r\nJustice, saw some of our installations and that was only a beginning of\r\nwhat really can be done.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I would certainly urge that all departments of government\r\nthat are involved in this area adopt the most modern methods of\r\nautomatic data processing with respect to the personnel files and other\r\nfiles relating to individuals. This would be helpful.\r\n\r\nBut I emphasize that a computer will not replace the man, and\r\ntherefore, we must have at all levels a complete exchange of\r\ninformation and cooperation between agencies where they share this\r\nresponsibility, and in going through this chronology, it points out the\r\ntype of exchange and cooperation that the Central Intelligence Agency\r\ntries to afford both the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation in matters where we have a common responsibility.\r\n\r\nI would like to emphasize the very great importance of this exchange,\r\nwhich is not always easily accomplished because it is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nSometimes it becomes involved in distracting people from other duties,\r\nand so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nI have given a good deal of thought to the matter of some incentives to\r\nbring out informers, thinking about the old informer statutes in which\r\nsome of them are still on the books, in which people were rewarded for\r\ninforming when others conducted themselves in a damaging way.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Smuggling cases?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Smuggling cases. But I believe that something could be\r\ndone. I call to the attention of this Commission one of the laws\r\nrelating to atomic energy, namely the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15\r\nJuly 1955 wherein a substantial reward is offered for the apprehension\r\nof persons responsible for the clandestine introduction or manufacture\r\nin the United States of such nuclear material or atomic weapons. It\r\nis suggested that the Commission may wish to recommend that original\r\nbut similar legislation be enacted which would induce individuals to\r\nfurnish information bearing on Presidential security by offering a\r\nsubstantial reward and preferential treatment. Substantial reward could\r\nrepresent a significant inducement even to staff officers and personnel\r\nof secret associations and state security organs abroad who are\r\ncharged with assassination and sabotage. We have information that such\r\npersonnel and police state apparatuses have expressed and, in certain\r\ncases, acted upon their repugnance for such work and for the political\r\nsystem which requires such duties to be performed.\r\n\r\nMr RANKIN. Is it your belief, Mr. McCone, that the methods for exchange\r\nof information between intelligence agencies of the Government could be\r\nmaterially improved.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I think the exchange between the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Secret Service\r\nis quite adequate. I am not informed as to whether the exchanges\r\nbetween the Secret Service and the FBI are equally adequate. I have not\r\ngone into that. I would have no means to know. Certainly it is most\r\nimportant that it be done.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Looking back now that you have the full record, do you feel\r\nthat you received from the State Department adequate information at the\r\ntime that they were aware of Oswald's defection and later activities\r\nin the Soviet Union, did you get at the time full information from the\r\nState Department on those particular subjects?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, I am not sure that we got full information, Mr.\r\nDulles. The fact is we had very little information in our files.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. It was probably minimal.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why did that happen?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. I am not sure, Mr. Ford. I can only assume that the State\r\nDepartment had a limited amount. Interestingly enough, it is far enough\r\nback now so that it's very hard to find people who were in the Moscow\r\nEmbassy at the time familiar with the case, so in trying to run this\r\ndown one comes to a lot of dead ends and I, therefore, would not like\r\nto hazard any guess.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Whose responsibility is it; is it CIA's\r\nresponsibility to obtain the information or State Department's\r\nresponsibility to supply it to Central Intelligence and to others.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. With respect to a U.S. citizen who goes abroad, it is the\r\nresponsibility of the State Department through its various echelons,\r\nconsular service and embassies and so forth.\r\n\r\nFor a foreigner coming into the United States, who might be of\r\nsuspicious character, coming here for espionage, subversion,\r\nassassination and other acts of violence, we would, and we do exchange\r\nthis information immediately with the FBI.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But in this particular case, Oswald in the Soviet\r\nUnion, whose responsibility was it to transmit the information,\r\nwhatever it was, to the Central Intelligence Agency?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, it would be the State Department's responsibility\r\nto do that. Whether there really exists an order or orders that\r\ninformation on an American citizen returning from a foreign country be\r\ntransmitted to CIA, I don't believe there are such regulations which\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. I don't believe they do, either.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I am not sure they should.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It wouldn't be your recommendation that you, the\r\nhead of Central Intelligence Agency, should have that information?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In a case of an American defecting to a Communist country,\r\nshouldn't you have it?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Certainly certain types of information. What we ought to\r\nbe careful of here, would be to rather clearly define the type of\r\ninformation which should be transmitted, because after all, there are\r\nhundreds of thousands or millions of Americans going back and forth\r\nevery year, and those records are the records of the Immigration\r\nService, the Passport Division.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was thinking of a person who having defected might, of\r\ncourse, have become an agent and then reinserted into the United States\r\nand if you were informed of the first steps to that you might help to\r\nprevent the second step.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, certainly information on defectors or possible\r\nrecruitments should be, and I have no question is being, transmitted.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What I was getting at was whether the procedures\r\nwere adequate or inadequate, whether the administration was proper\r\nor improper in this particular case, and if some files you have that\r\nstarted when he attempted to defect are inadequate why we ought to\r\nknow, and we ought to know whether the basic regulations were right or\r\nwrong, whether the administration was proper or improper, that is what\r\nI am trying to find out.\r\n\r\nI would like your comment on it.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, I think the basic regulations should be examined\r\nvery carefully to be sure that they are copper-riveted down and\r\nabsolutely tight. What I am saying, however, is because of the vast\r\nnumber of Americans who go abroad and stay in foreign countries for\r\nindefinite periods of time, it would be an impossible task to transmit\r\nall information available in the State Department and Immigration\r\nService as files to the Central Intelligence Agency. It would not be a\r\nproductive exercise. What must be transmitted and is being transmitted,\r\nwhile I cannot recite the exact regulations is information that is,\r\nbecomes, known to the various embassies of suspicious Americans that\r\nmight have been recruited and defected, and then returned so that they\r\nwould be agents in place.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In this case, Oswald attempted to defect, he did\r\nnot, he subsequently sought the right to return to the United States,\r\nhe had contact with the Embassy. Was the Central Intelligence Agency\r\ninformed of these steps, step by step, by the Department of State?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. You might answer that.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Mr. Ford, in order to answer this question precisely I\r\nwould have to have the file in front of me. I have not looked at it\r\nin some time so I don't have it all that clearly in mind. But it is\r\nmy impression that we were not informed step by step. When I say that\r\nthere is no requirement that I am aware of that the State Department\r\nshould inform us and when I said a moment ago that we had minimal\r\ninformation from them, this was not in any sense a critical comment but\r\na statement of fact.\r\n\r\nBut an American going to the American Embassy would be handled by\r\nthe Embassy officials, either consular or otherwise. This would be a\r\nmatter well within the purview of the State Department to keep all\r\nthe way through, because we do not have responsibility in the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency for the conduct or behavior or anything else of\r\nAmerican citizens when they are abroad unless there is some special\r\nconsideration applying to an individual, or someone in higher authority\r\nrequests assistance from us. So that the State Department, I think,\r\nquite properly would regard this matter as well within their purview\r\nto handle themselves within the Embassy or from the Embassy back to\r\nthe Department of State without involving the Agency in it while these\r\nevents were occurring.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it could be argued, however, that the\r\nuniqueness of this individual case was such that the Department of\r\nState might well have contacted the Central Intelligence Agency to\r\nkeep them abreast of the developments as they transpired. This is\r\nnot--and when I say this, I mean the Oswald case--is not an ordinary\r\nrun-of-the-mill-type of case. It is far from it. Even back in the time,\r\nwell, from the time he went, and particularly as time progressed, and\r\nhe made application to return, there is nothing ordinary about the\r\nwhole situation.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is quite correct; there is no question about that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And I am only suggesting that if the regulations\r\nwere not adequate at the time and are not now, maybe something ought to\r\nbe done about it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McCone, when you said that supplying all of the\r\ninformation about U.S. citizens who went abroad and came back to\r\nthe country would not be a profitable exercise, did that comment\r\ninclude the thought that such an intrusion upon all citizens would be\r\nquestionable?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Such an intrusion?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Upon their right to travel.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, I think this would have a bearing on it. I did\r\nnot have that particular matter in mind when I made that statement,\r\nhowever. I was just thinking of the----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Burden?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Of the burden of vast numbers involved.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you you have any thought in regard to whether it would\r\nbe an intrusion upon their rights?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Well, that would be a matter of how it was handled.\r\nCertainly, if it was handled in a way that the counterpart of providing\r\nthe information was to impose restrictions on them, then it would be an\r\nintrusion on their rights.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I inquire?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator Cooper.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I missed the first part of Mr. McCone's testimony; I\r\nwent to answer a quorum call. Perhaps the question has been asked.\r\n\r\nIt has been brought into evidence that a number of people in the\r\nEmbassy talked to Oswald when he first defected, and the various\r\ncommunications with the Embassy and, of course, when he left to come\r\nback to the United States. Have we been able to ascertain the names of\r\nofficials in the Embassy or employees with whom Oswald talked on these\r\nvarious occasions?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I am not familiar with them; no.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. Neither am I, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. I presume that the Department's inquiries have covered it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is it possible to ascertain the names of those\r\nemployees?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Senator Cooper, I can answer that. We have inquired of\r\nthe State Department for that information, and are in the process of\r\nobtaining it all.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Taking into consideration your answers to the previous\r\nquestion, would it have been possible in your judgment to have secured\r\nmore comprehensive information about the activities of Oswald in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. It would not have been possible for the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency to have secured such information because we do not\r\nhave the resources to gain such information.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anything more? Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the Central Intelligence Agency investigate\r\nany aspects of Oswald's trip to Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; we did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you give us any information on that?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; we were aware that Oswald did make a trip to Mexico\r\nCity and it was our judgment that he was there in the interest of\r\ninsuring transit privileges and that he made contact with the Cuban\r\nEmbassy while he was there.\r\n\r\nWe do not know the precise results of his effort, but we assumed,\r\nbecause he returned to the United States, he was unsuccessful. We have\r\nexamined to every extent we can, and using all resources available to\r\nus every aspect of his activity and we could not verify that he was\r\nthere for any other purpose or that his trip to Mexico was in any way\r\nrelated to his later action in assassinating President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the Central Intelligence Agency make any\r\ninvestigation of any alleged connection between Oswald and the Castro\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Yes; we investigated that in considerable detail, because\r\ninformation came to us through a third party that he had carried on\r\na rather odd discussion with Cuban officials in the Cuban Embassy in\r\nMexico City. The allegation was that he had received under rather odd\r\ncircumstances a substantial amount of money in the Cuban Embassy, and\r\nthe statement was made by one who claimed to have seen this transaction\r\ntake place. After a very thorough and detailed examination of the\r\ninformer, it finally turned out by the informer's own admission that\r\nthe information was entirely erroneous, and was made for the purpose\r\nof advancing the informer's own standing with the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency and the U.S. Government and it was subsequently retracted by the\r\ninformer in its entirety.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any other evidence or alleged\r\nevidence----\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Parenthetically, I might add a word for the record that\r\nthe date that the informer gave as to the date in time of this\r\nalleged transaction was impossible because through other, from other,\r\ninformation we determined that Oswald was in the United States at that\r\nparticular time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the Central Intelligence Agency ever make an\r\ninvestigation or did it ever check on Mr. Ruby's trip to Cuba or any\r\nconnections he might have had with the Castro government?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. We had no information.\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. We had no information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Central Intelligence Agency has no information of\r\nany connections of Ruby to the Castro government?\r\n\r\nMr. McCONE. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever make a check of that?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. We checked our records to see if we had information and\r\nfound we did not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What would that indicate, the fact that you\r\nchecked your records?\r\n\r\nMr. HELMS. That would indicate that if we had received information\r\nfrom our own resources, that the Cubans were involved with Mr. Ruby in\r\nsomething which would be regarded as subversive, we would then have\r\nit in our files. But we received no such information, and I don't,\r\nby saying this, mean that he did not. I simply say we don't have any\r\nrecord of this.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Director, thank you very much, sir, for coming and being\r\nwith us and we appreciate the help your department has given to us.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, June 4, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THOMAS J. KELLEY, LEO J. GAUTHIER, LYNDAL L. SHANEYFELT,\r\nAND ROBERT A. FRAZIER\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 2:10 p.m., on June 4, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren. Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald R. Ford, Allen W. Dulles, and John J.\r\nMcCloy, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Arlen Specter, assistant counsel; Waggoner Carr,\r\nattorney general of Texas; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THOMAS J. KELLEY\r\n\r\n(Members present at this point: The Chairman, Representative Ford, Mr.\r\nDulles, and Mr. McCloy.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, we have witnesses today who are Thomas\r\nJ. Kelley of the Secret Service; Leo J. Gauthier, Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt,\r\nand Robert A. Frazier of the FBI. They are going to testify concerning\r\ncertain onsite tests made in Dallas at the scene of the assassination,\r\nand of preliminary studies which were made prior to the onsite tests at\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMay we have them sworn in as a group?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. Will you rise and raise your right hands, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthis Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated, gentlemen. Mr. Kelley, will you take\r\nthe witness chair, please? Mr. Specter will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Thomas J. Kelley.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By whom are you employed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I am employed by the U.S. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I am an inspector.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In a general way, of what do your duties consist, Mr.\r\nKelley?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. As an inspector, I am part of the chief's headquarters\r\nstaff. I conduct office inspections of our field and protective\r\ninstallations, and report on their actions to the chief.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been with the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate in the planning of the onsite tests at\r\nDallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you participate in the making of those tests?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what date was the onsite testing made?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was a week ago Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be May 24, 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What car was used for testing purposes?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The car that was used was a 1956 specially built Cadillac,\r\nopen, a convertible, seven-passenger Cadillac. It has a termination\r\nof 679-X, the Secret Service calls it. It is a car that is used as a\r\nfollowup car to the President's car when he is in a motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that car actually in the motorcade on November 22,\r\n1963, in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any special reason why the car in which the\r\nPresident rode on November 22 was not used?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; the car in which the President rode has been modified\r\nby a body builder in Cincinnati, the Hess & Eisenhardt Co. of\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have a diagram showing the dimensions of the\r\nSecret Service followup car which was used during the onsite tests?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I have. It was felt that the best simulation of the test\r\ncould be presented by having a car that was similar to the car in which\r\nthe President was riding, which was also an open Lincoln convertible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, I would like to mark the\r\ndiagram of the followup car as Commission Exhibit No. 871 and move its\r\nadmission into evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 871 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have diagrams showing the dimensions of the\r\nPresidential car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I would like to have that marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n872 and move for its admission into evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 872 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Without specifying all of the details, Inspector Kelley,\r\nare the followup car and the Presidential car generally similar in\r\ndimensions?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; they are. There are very few, of course,\r\nseven-passenger convertible cars in existence, and these are\r\nspecially--these cars are specially built for us by the Lincoln--the\r\nFord Motor Co. and the followup car by the General Motors Co.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe what seating arrangements are present\r\nin each of those cars in between the permanent front seat and the\r\npermanent rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. There are two jump seats that can be opened up for riders\r\nin each of the cars. In the Presidential followup car, these jump seats\r\nare usually occupied by Secret Service agents.\r\n\r\nIn the President's car, they are occupied by the President's guests.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the assassination, of course, the jump seats were\r\noccupied by Mrs. Connally and Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kelley, have you brought with you two photographs\r\ndepicting the interior of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I have. These are photographs of the interior of the\r\nPresident's car which is known to us as 100-X.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, I would like to mark one of\r\nthese photographs as Commission Exhibit No. 873, and move its admission\r\ninto evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 873 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I would like to mark the second photograph as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 874 and move, also, its admission into evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 874 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe briefly what Exhibit No. 873 depicts,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Exhibit No. 873 is a photograph of the interior of the\r\nrear section of the 100-X, the President's car, showing the seating\r\narrangement in the car and the jump seats are in an open position.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. As of what time were these photographs taken?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I am sorry, Commissioner. I don't know just when those\r\nphotographs were taken. They were taken some time in the last 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to Exhibits Nos. 873 and 874, do they accurately depict\r\nthe condition of the President's car as of November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. They do, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe briefly what Exhibit No. 874 shows?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Exhibit No. 874 is another photograph of the car taken from\r\nthe rear, and it shows the relative positions of the jump seats in an\r\nopen position as they relate to the back seat of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the record may be clear, which Commission number\r\nhas been given to the diagram of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The President's car is Exhibit No. 872.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the followup car diagram is what?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Exhibit No. 871.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you know whether these photographs were taken before or\r\nafter the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Before the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did the car that you used for this test--did that car have\r\nthe seat lifting capacity that I understand the President's car had?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. No; it did not, sir. I might say that there is in the\r\nCommission's records photographs of the President's car after the\r\nassassination, showing the condition of it after the assassination, at\r\nthe garage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the President's car itself, what is the distance on the\r\nright edge of the right jump seat, that is to say from the right edge\r\nof the right jump seat to the door on the right side?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. There is 6 inches of clearance between the jump seat and\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the relative position of the jump seat to the\r\nrear seat on the Presidential automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. There is 8-1/2 inches between the back of the jump seat and\r\nthe front of the back seat of the President's car, the rear seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the relative height of the jump seat and the\r\nrear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The jump seat is 3 inches lower than the back seat in its\r\nbottom position. That is, the back seat of the President's car had a\r\nmechanism which would raise it 10-1/2 inches. But at the time of the\r\nassassination, the seat was in its lowest position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the differential between the jump seats and\r\nthe rear seat on the Secret Service followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The jump seat of the Secret Service car is a little closer\r\nto the right door.\r\n\r\nHowever, the seating arrangement is not exactly the same in these cars,\r\nin that there is a portion of a padding that comes around on the rear\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nBut relatively, when two persons are seated in this car, one in the\r\nrear seat and one in the jump seat, they are in the same alinement as\r\nthey were in the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question in response to your statement\r\nthat the back seat was in its lowest position at the time of the\r\nassassination? How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. That is a result of questioning of the people who took the\r\ncar, the driver who took the car from the hospital to the plane. This\r\nwas one of the drivers of the Presidential car. There was nobody who\r\ntouched the car until it got back to the White House garage. It was in\r\nhis custody all the time. And he did not move it.\r\n\r\nWhen it was in the White House garage, it was at its lowest point.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And there would be no opportunity to lower it from the time\r\nthe President was shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. No, sir. The President, of course, operates that thing\r\nhimself. But when it was examined, at the time it was examined, and it\r\nwas in the custody of this man all the time, it had not been touched.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the height of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. He was 72-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you present when a man was placed in the same\r\nposition in the Secret Service followup car as that in which President\r\nKennedy sat in the Presidential car when the tests were simulated on\r\nMay 24th of this year?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the name of that individual?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. He was an FBI agent by the name of James W. Anderton.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the height of Mr. Anderton?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. He was 72-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the height of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Governor Connally was 6 foot 4.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that the height of the Governor himself or the\r\nGovernor's stand-in?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was my understanding that Governor Connally was--6 foot\r\n2, I guess. The Governor's stand-in, Mr. Doyle Williams, was 6 foot 4.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when those two individuals were seated in\r\nthe Secret Service followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what adjustment was made, if any, so that the relative\r\npositions of those two men were the same as the positioning of\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The officials at Hess Eisenhardt, who have the original\r\nplans of the President's car, conducted a test to ascertain how high\r\nfrom the ground a person 72-1/2 inches would be seated in this car\r\nbefore its modification. And it was ascertained that the person would\r\nbe 52.78 inches from the ground--that is, taking into consideration the\r\nflexion of the tires, the flexion of the cushions that were on the car\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say 52.78 inches, which individual would that be?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. That would be the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what part of his body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The top of the head would be 52.78 inches from the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Anderton was placed in the followup car, it was found that the\r\ntop of his head was 62 inches from the ground. There was an adjustment\r\nmade so that there would be--the stand-in for Governor Connally would\r\nbe in relatively the same position, taking into consideration the\r\n3-inch difference in the jump seat and the 2-inch difference in his\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Considering the 3-inch difference in the jump seat--and\r\nI believe it would be an inch and a half difference in height between\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally--how much higher, then,\r\napproximately, was President Kennedy sitting than the Governor on\r\nNovember 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I am not----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the President have been about an inch and half\r\nhigher than the Governor on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. The day of the assassination, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Wouldn't the height of these men depend upon the length\r\nof their torso?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Well,----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You have some people who are shortwaisted, some people\r\nwho are longwaisted. I don't know which either of these men were who\r\nwere of the same height. But I know there is a lot of difference in\r\nmen. We sometimes see the--a man who looks large sitting down, when he\r\nstands up he is small, because he has a long torso, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Of course the relative positions are apparent from the\r\nfilms that were taken at the time of the assassination. It would be, of\r\ncourse, that judgment--and it would have to be a judgment. But I think\r\nthe films indicate there was just about that much difference in their\r\nheight when both were seated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Inspector Kelley, I hand you a photograph marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 697, which has heretofore been admitted into\r\nevidence, and identified by Governor Connally as depicting the\r\nPresident and the Governor as they rode in the motorcade on the day of\r\nthe assassination, and I ask you if the stand-ins for the President and\r\nthe Governor were seated in approximately the same relative positions\r\non the reconstruction on May 24.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir; in my judgment that is very close.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What marking, if any, was placed on the back of President\r\nKennedy--the stand-in for President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. There was a chalk mark placed on his coat, in this area\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did that chalk mark represent?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. That represented the entry point of the shot which wounded\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how was the location for that mark fixed or determined?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. That was fixed from the photographs of a medical drawing\r\nthat was made by the physicians and the people at Parkland and an\r\nexamination of the coat which the President was wearing at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the drawing, was that not the drawing made by the\r\nautopsy surgeons from Bethesda Naval Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Bethesda Naval.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Not Parkland, as I understand it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No, sir; not Parkland, because as the record will show,\r\nthe President was not turned over at Parkland.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I was shown a drawing of--that was prepared by some medical\r\ntechnicians indicating the point of entry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to show you Commission Exhibit No. 386, which\r\nhas heretofore been marked and introduced into evidence, and I ask you\r\nif that is the drawing that you were shown as the basis for the marking\r\nof the wound on the back of the President's neck.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the record will show, may it please the Commission,\r\nthat this was made by the autopsy surgeons at Bethesda.\r\n\r\nAnd was there any marking placed on the back of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; there was a marking placed on the back of his coat\r\nin the area where the medical testimony had indicated the bullet had\r\nentered Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what coat was worn by the stand-in for Governor\r\nConnally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was the coat that Governor Connally was wearing at the\r\ntime he was injured.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the chalk circle placed around the hole which\r\nappeared on the back of that coat garment?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were certain tests made by the Secret Service shortly\r\nafter the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were those tests reduced to photographs which were\r\ncompiled in an album?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; in Commission Document No. 88, we took some\r\nphotographs of the scene of the assassination on December 5, 1963, from\r\nthe window of the Texas Book Depository, and from the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The number which you refer to bears Commission No. 88,\r\nwhich is an index number which was given for internal Commission\r\ndocument filing, but it has not been marked as a Commission exhibit.\r\n\r\nI would now like to mark it Commission Exhibit No. 875 and move for its\r\nadmission into evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 875 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does a photograph in that group show the condition of the\r\nfoliage of the trees in the vicinity where the assassination occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. One question. This photograph was taken, though, several\r\nweeks later, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. On December 5.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was 2 weeks later.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Two weeks later; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So the foliage would presumably be somewhat less in that\r\npicture, would it not, than it was on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. No; actually, the foliage hadn't changed very much even in\r\nthe latest tests we are making.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It was an evergreen?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was an oak tree, Mr. Chief Justice, I have been told the\r\nfoliage doesn't change much during the year. They call it pine oak.\r\nSome people call it a life oak. But the people down there I talked to\r\nsaid it was called a pine oak.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you observe the foliage on the tree on May 24?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you state the relative condition of that\r\nfoliage, as contrasted with the photographs you have before you taken\r\non December 5?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. It was very similar, practically the same.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the description which you have just given applies to\r\na large oak tree which intervened between a point on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository Building and any automobile which\r\nwould have been driven down the center lane of Elm Street in a westerly\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, the purpose of having Inspector Kelley\r\ntestify was just to set the scene. That completes our questioning of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. Thank you, Inspector Kelley.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The next witness will be Inspector Gauthier.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LEO J. GAUTHIER\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Leo J. Gauthier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by whom are you employed, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. The Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your rank with the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Inspector. I am in charge of the Bureau's exhibit\r\nsection, where we prepare investigative aids, consisting of diagrams,\r\ncharts, maps, three-dimensional exhibits, in connection with the\r\npresentation of cases in court.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been employed by the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Twenty-nine years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to reconstruct certain models to\r\nscale in connection with the investigation on the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what model reproduction, if any, did you make of the\r\nscene of the assassination itself?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. The data, concerning the scene of the assassination,\r\nwas developed by the Bureau's Exhibits Section, including myself, at\r\nthe site on December 2, 3, and 4, of 1963. From this data we built\r\na three-dimensional exhibit, one-quarter of an inch to the foot. It\r\ncontained the pertinent details of the site, including street lights,\r\ncatch basin, concrete structures in the area, including buildings,\r\ngrades, scale models of the cars that comprised the motorcade,\r\nconsisting of the police lead car, the Presidential car, the followup\r\ncar, the Lincoln open car that the Vice President was riding in, and\r\nthe followup car behind the Vice-Presidential car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the model of the scene itself, Mr. Gauthier, did you\r\nreproduce a portion of the scene which is depicted in Commission\r\nExhibit No. 876?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Handing you that Commission Exhibit No. 876, I will ask\r\nyou to describe what it represents in toto.\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. This is an aerial view of the site known as Dealey Plaza,\r\nin Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nIt indicates the large buildings that surround this area. They are\r\nnumbered 1 through 11. It indicates the main streets--Commerce, Main,\r\nand Elm Streets, and the roadways through the plaza, including the\r\ntriple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a document which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 877 and ask you if that document was obtained by\r\nyou in connection with the survey for the model which you prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes; this is a description of Dealey Plaza stating the\r\nhistorical background and the physical description.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I move at this time for the admission into evidence of\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 876 and 877.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 876 and\r\n877 for identification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Inspector, I now hand you two photographs marked as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 878 and 879 and ask you to state what those\r\ndepict.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 878 and\r\n879 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Commission Exhibit No. 878 is a view of the scale model\r\nlooking toward the northeast with the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding in the background, together with the Daltex Building, and a\r\nportion of the Dallas County Courthouse. It includes the pergola to the\r\nleft, and the pericycle structure on the right with the reflecting pool\r\nin the immediate background.\r\n\r\nIt also shows the roadway through the plaza, which is an extension of\r\nElm Street, upon which appears miniature scale models of the vehicles\r\nin the motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What motorcade is this?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. We are depicting the Presidential motorcade at the time\r\nof the assassination, the motorcade that passed that area.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And this was done on what day?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Our data to build this were compiled on December 2, 3,\r\nand 4. It took about 5 weeks to prepare this exhibit in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you now describe what is shown on the photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Commission Exhibit No. 879 is a view of the scale model\r\nlooking toward the southwest, in the direction of the Triple Underpass,\r\nfrom a position on the sixth floor in the southeast corner window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you two additional photographs marked as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 880 and 881, and ask you to state what they\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 880 and\r\n881 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Commission Exhibit No. 880 is a scale dimension view of\r\nthe sixth floor looking toward the southeast corner of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in the corner of that photograph is the area depicted\r\nwhich has been described as the possible site of the rifleman?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now describe what Exhibit No. 881 shows?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Commission Exhibit No. 881 is a three-dimensional view of\r\nleading down from Main Street and Commerce Street. Positioned on the\r\nramps are scale models of an armored van and two police squad cars.\r\nThere are also miniature mockups of individuals--representing position\r\nof people in this area of the basement garage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what event is depicted in that model, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. This represents the arrangement, physical arrangement, in\r\nthe basement at the time Lee Harvey Oswald walked out from the elevator\r\nthrough the jail office onto the basement ramp.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where have these models been maintained since the time\r\nthey were prepared by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. The models were delivered to the Commission's building\r\nand installed in the exhibits room on the first floor, on January 20,\r\n1964.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I now move for the admission into\r\nevidence of the photographs 878, 879, 880, and 881.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 878, 879, 880, and 881, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate in the onsite tests made in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was a survey made of the scene used to record some of the\r\nresults of that onsite testing?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by whom was the survey made?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. The survey was made on May 24, 1964, by Robert H. West,\r\ncounty surveyor, a licensed State land surveyor, located at 160 County\r\nCourthouse, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you brought the tracing of that survey with you today?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. I have; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you brought a cardboard reproduction of that?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. A copy made from the tracing; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you produce the cardboard copy made from the tracing\r\nfor the inspection of the Commission at this time, please?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you produce the tracing at this time, please?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes; the tracing is wrapped, and sealed in this container.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Without breaking the seal, I will ask you if the cardboard\r\nwhich has been set up here--may the record show it is a large\r\ncardboard. I will ask you for the dimensions in just a minute.\r\n\r\nDoes the printing on the cardboard represent an exact duplication of\r\nthe tracing which you have in your hand?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, we will mark the tracing\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 882, and not take it out, since the cardboard\r\nrepresents it, and place Commission Exhibit No. 883 on the cardboard\r\ndrawing itself, and I would like to move for the admission into\r\nevidence of both Exhibits Nos. 882 and 883.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 882 and\r\n883 for identification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now describe what Exhibit No. 883 is, Inspector\r\nGauthier, indicating, first of all, the approximate size of the\r\ncardboard?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. This is a copy of the tracing measuring 40 inches in\r\nwidth, 72 inches in length. It is made to a scale of 1 inch equals 10\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nFrom the data compiled on that day by the surveyor, this tracing was\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThe area is bounded on the north by the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding, and on further here by railroad property.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a general westerly direction from the School\r\nBook Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes; I am pointing towards the west.\r\n\r\nOn the east it is bounded by Houston Street.\r\n\r\nOn the south by Main, which is a roadway going through Dealey Plaza.\r\n\r\nAnd on the west by the triple underpass.\r\n\r\nLocated on this plat map are street lights accurately located, a\r\ncatch basin, certain trees, location of trees, the delineation of the\r\nconcrete pergola, which you see here on the photograph, the outer\r\nboundaries of the pericycle, and the reflecting pool--locating exactly\r\nthe window in the Texas School Book Depository Building, in the\r\nsoutheast corner, and also a tabulation of the measurements and angles\r\nthat the surveyor has compiled from certain positions identified for\r\nhim on the street by an observation from this window, an observation\r\nfrom the position of Mr. Zapruder----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say this window, which window did you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. The window on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, the one in the southeast corner, the farthest\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you identify the Zapruder position, what did you\r\nmean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. This is a concrete abutment of the pergola, located in\r\nthe area upon which Zapruder was standing at the time the movies were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other positions noted on the diagram that\r\nyou have been describing showing where other movies were made?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. Yes.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. We also locate the position of Mr. Nix, who also made\r\nmovies of the motorcade at certain points on the roadway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what street was Mr. Nix standing?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. I am pointing now to the south side of Main Street,\r\napproximately in front of the concrete pylon of the south pericycle\r\nstructure. That is a short distance from the intersection of Main and\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A short distance west of the intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. West.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what other position is shown of the situs of a movie\r\nphotographer?\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. We have another position here by Mrs. Mary Muchmore, who\r\nmade movies of the motorcade movement along the Elm Street roadway on\r\nNovember 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a schedule which I have marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 884 and ask you what figures are contained\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 884 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. GAUTHIER. This is a copy of a tabulation which appears on the\r\nplat map. It contains certain positions marked as frame numbers. It\r\nindicates elevations and a column dealing with angle of sight from the\r\nframe positions to the window and to a horizontal line.\r\n\r\nIt also contains angels of sight the degree of sight and distances from\r\nthese positions to a point on the top of the bridge, handrail height.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, that concludes the\r\ndescription of the general setting.\r\n\r\nI would like to move now at this time for the admission into evidence\r\nof Exhibit No. 884, which completes all of the exhibits used heretofore.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 884, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, that completes the testimony\r\nof Inspector Gauthier.\r\n\r\nI would like to call Mr. Shaneyfelt.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mr Shaneyfelt?\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LYNDAL L. SHANEYFELT\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By whom are you employed?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I am employed as a special agent of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been so employed?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Fourteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What are your duties, in a general way?\r\n\r\nMr SHANEYFELT. I am assigned to the FBI Laboratory, as a document\r\nexaminer, and photographic expert.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. During the course of those duties, have you had occasion\r\nto make an analysis of certain movies which purport to have been taken\r\nof the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What movies have you examined?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I have examined a roll of 8-mm. motion pictures made by\r\nMr. Abraham Zapruder of Dallas, Tex., that he took on November 22, of\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you outline in a general way how the movies taken by\r\nMr. Zapruder came into your possession?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; Mr. Zapruder, on realizing what he had in his\r\nphotographs, took them immediately to a local Dallas processing plant,\r\nhad them processed, and had three copies made. He turned two copies of\r\nthose movies over to representatives of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe original and other copy he sold to Life magazine.\r\n\r\nThe FBI was given one of the copies by the Secret Service. The Secret\r\nService loaned a copy to us long enough for us to make a copy for our\r\nuse, which we did, and this copy is the one that I have been examining.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At any time in the course of the examination of the\r\nZapruder film, was the original of that movie obtained?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; it was. On February 25, Mr. Herbert Orth, who\r\nis the assistant chief of the Life magazine photographic laboratory,\r\nprovided the original of the Zapruder film for review by the Commission\r\nrepresentatives and representatives of the FBI and Secret Service here\r\nin the Commission building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the reason for his making that original\r\navailable?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Life magazine was reluctant to release the original\r\nbecause of the value. So he brought it down personally and projected\r\nit for us and allowed us to run through it several times, studying the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that because the copies were not distinct on certain\r\nimportant particulars?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. The original had considerably more\r\ndetail and more there to study than any of the copies, since in the\r\nphotographic process each time you copy you lose some detail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And subsequently, were slides made from the original of\r\nthe Zapruder film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes. Since it was not practical to stop the projector\r\nwhen using the original of the Zapruder film, because of the\r\npossibility of damage to the film, Mr. Orth volunteered to prepare\r\n35-mm. color slides directly from the original movie of all of the\r\npertinent frames of the assassination which were determined to be\r\nframes 171 through 434.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline what you mean by frames, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes. In motion picture films, the actual motion\r\npicture film consists of consecutive pictures that are made in rapid\r\nsuccession, each one being a separate exposure. And as the camera runs,\r\nit films these, and they are projected fast enough on the screen when\r\nyou do not have the sensation of them being individual pictures, but\r\nyou have the sensation of seeing the movement--even though they are\r\nindividual little pictures on the film. So each one of those little\r\npictures on the film is called a frame.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how did you number the frames?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I numbered the frames on the Zapruder film beginning\r\nwith No. 1 at the assassination portion of his film.\r\n\r\nHe did have on his film some photographs of a personal nature that we\r\ndisregarded, and started at the first frame of his motion picture that\r\nwas made there on Elm Street of the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was happening at the time of frame 1?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. At the time of frame 1, the police motorcycle lead\r\nportion of the parade is in view, and that goes for several frames.\r\nThen he stopped his camera, feeling that it might be some time before\r\nthe Presidential car came into view. Then when the Presidential car\r\nrounded the corner and came into view, he started his camera again, and\r\nkept it running throughout the route down Elm Street until the car went\r\nout of sight on his right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other movies have been examined by you in the course\r\nof this analysis?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. An amateur 8-mm. motion picture film made by a Mr.\r\nOrville Nix of Dallas, Tex., has been examined. Mr. Nix was standing on\r\nthe corner of Houston and Main Streets, photographing the motorcade as\r\nit came down Main Street and turned right into Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you explain briefly how you ascertained the location\r\nof Mr. Nix when he took those movies?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes. At the time Mr. Nix took his movies of the\r\nmotorcade coming down Main Street, he was standing on the corner, and\r\nphotographed them turning the corner and going down Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are now indicating the southwest corner of Houston and\r\nMain?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; southwest corner. After he heard the shots, he\r\nhurried down along the curb of Main Street, but did not remember\r\nexactly where he was standing. On the basis of his motion pictures, we\r\nwere able to analyze the pictures using his camera, and on the 23d of\r\nMay of this year, during the survey, preparatory to the reenactment,\r\nwe reestablished this point by viewing pictures taken from his motion\r\npicture camera, at varying angles across here, in order to reestablish\r\nthe point where he was standing, based on the relationship of this\r\nstreet light to other items in the background of the photograph.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say this point, you mean the point of the Nix\r\nposition?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say this street light, you are referring to a\r\nstreet lamp on the opposite side of Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline in a general way how you obtained the\r\ncopy of the Nix film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe Nix film was obtained as a result of a notice that the FBI gave to\r\nprocessing plants in the Dallas area, that the FBI would be interested\r\nin obtaining or knowing about any film they processed, that had\r\nanything on it, relating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a result of this, we learned of the Nix film and arranged to\r\nobtain a copy of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you analyze any other film in connection with this\r\ninquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes. I analyzed a film that was 8-mm. motion picture\r\nfilm taken by Mrs. Mary Muchmore of Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you obtain a copy of that film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Our first knowledge of this came as a result of a\r\nreview of the book \"Four Days\" which covers the assassination period,\r\nin which representatives of the FBI noted a colored picture taken from\r\na motion picture film that did not match either the Nix film or the\r\nZapruder film.\r\n\r\nOnce we established that, then we investigated and learned that it was\r\nmade by Mrs. Mary Muchmore, and was at that time in the possession of\r\nUnited Press International in New York, and made arrangements for them\r\nto furnish us with a copy of the Muchmore film. That is the copy that I\r\nused for examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was Mrs. Muchmore standing at the time she took\r\nthose movies?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Mrs. Muchmore was standing along Houston Street,\r\nclose to the corner of Main, on the west side of Houston Street, and\r\nphotographed the motorcade as it came down Main, turned into Houston,\r\nand proceeded down Houston. She says that when she heard the shots, she\r\npanicked, and did not take any further pictures. But a review of her\r\nfilm shows pictures of the assassination route, the motorcade going\r\ndown Elm Street, beginning just before the shot that hit the President\r\nin the head, and continuing a short period after that.\r\n\r\nSince she did not remember taking the pictures, we then, in the same\r\nmanner we established Mr. Nix's position, by checking the photograph in\r\nrelation to objects in the background, established her position along\r\nthis structure that is marked on the map and found that she had come\r\nfrom the curb over to this point----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a position on Exhibit No. 883 marked \"Muchmore\r\nPosition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nAnd this we established as her position when she photographed a portion\r\nof the assassination--motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you elaborate just a bit more on how you ascertained\r\nthat position from fixed points in the background of the movie?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; we took a frame of the motion picture that is\r\nclose to the beginning and a picture that is close to the end, and made\r\na still photograph of those. We then establish a position and try to\r\nline up the relationship of objects close to where we are standing with\r\nobjects in the background, so that they are in relation to each other\r\nas they are in the picture.\r\n\r\nThen we take the other picture from farther along the motion picture\r\nfilm, and do the same thing, and where those two lines intersect is\r\nwhere she had to be standing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You draw two straight lines through two objects that you\r\nline up on each of those pictures, and the intersection point of those\r\ntwo lines is the calculated position of the camera.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that same system used to ascertain the position of\r\nMr. Nix?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how did you ascertain the position of Mr. Zapruder?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Mr. Zapruder's position was known, as he was on the top\r\nof the abutment along Elm Street--he stated that he was standing on the\r\nabutment. And there is relatively no room to move around there, other\r\nthan to stand there. It is about 2 feet wide by 3 to 4 feet deep.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. And aside from that, we checked that position against\r\nhis photographs and determined that that was in fact correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the position of Mr. Zapruder confirmed through the use\r\nof any other film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; in Mr. Nix's motion picture films you can see Mr.\r\nZapruder standing on the abutment.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there?\r\n\r\nAfter you had made those calculations to establish the position of\r\nMrs. Muchmore and Mr. Nix and Mr. Zapruder, did you then identify\r\nthose positions to the three and ask them whether or not it\r\ncorresponded--your findings corresponded with their recollection as to\r\nwhere they were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We did not do that; no. Mr. Nix, I might say, did state\r\nthat he went down along this side--the south side of Main Street, along\r\nthe curb, and it generally conforms to where he stated he went, but he\r\ncould not place the exact position. We did, by this study.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Zapruder's position was established by another\r\nphotograph?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do I understand you correctly that Mrs. Muchmore didn't\r\nrealize she had taken the later pictures that appear?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. According to her statement, she said after hearing the\r\nshots, she panicked, and didn't take any more pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think she did?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On the film there are pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the position of Mrs. Muchmore and Mr. Nix ascertained\r\nthrough a geometric calculation, lining up various points as you have\r\njust described?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Well, it is actually a geometric calculation, although\r\nno strings were drawn or no lines were drawn. It is a matter of\r\nstanding in a position out there with Mr. Nix's camera, and viewing the\r\ntwo different photographs we had selected, until we arrived at a point\r\nthat matched.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there reasonable mathematical certainty in that\r\nalinement, within the limits of your observations of their pictures?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mr. Zapruder himself point out his location on the\r\nabutment as depicted on Exhibit No. 883?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how many occasions were you a participant in an\r\nanalysis of these various films which you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Seven.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when was the first time that you were a participant in\r\nsuch an analysis?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On January 27, 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who else has been with you at the time you analyzed\r\nthose films--just stating in in a general way without identifying each\r\nperson present on each of the occasions?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On most occasions, Mr. Gauthier of the FBI was present,\r\nI was present, Mr. Malley of the FBI was present. Inspector Kelley from\r\nSecret Service, and Mr. John Howlett from Secret Service.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the Commission were always present--normally Mr.\r\nRedlich, Mr. Specter, or Mr. Eisenberg were present.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions Mr. Ball and Mr. Belin were present. Mr. Rankin\r\nwas present on some occasions.\r\n\r\nI believe Mr. McCloy was present on one occasion.\r\n\r\nVarious representatives of the Commission were present.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long did those analysis sessions ordinarily last?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. They would normally last most of the day, about all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what would be done during the course of those\r\nanalytical sessions?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. In each case we would take the film and run it through\r\nregular speed, slow motion, we would stop it on individual frames and\r\nstudy it frame by frame, trying to see in the photographs anything that\r\nwould give any indication of a shot hitting its mark, a reaction of the\r\nPresident, a reaction of Mr. Connally or Mrs. Connally, reaction of the\r\nSecret Service agents, reaction of people in the crowd, relating it to\r\nall the facts that we felt were important.\r\n\r\nWhen we obtained the slides from Life magazine, we went through those\r\nvery thoroughly, because they gave so much more detail and were so\r\nmuch clearer and analyzed again all these things about the reaction\r\nof the President and Mr. Connally, trying to ascertain where he was\r\nreacting--whether either one was reacting to being hit.\r\n\r\nOf course the only shot that is readily apparent in any of the films,\r\nand it appears in the Zapruder, the Nix, and the Muchmore films, is the\r\nshot that hit the President in the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why do you say that is readily apparent?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Because on the film there is practically an explosion\r\nof his head and this is obviously the shot that hit the President in\r\nthe head. It is very apparent from the photograph.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were any others present at any time, such as\r\nwitnesses who appeared before the Commission, during the analysis\r\nsessions on these films and slides?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nOn April 14, representatives of the Commission, FBI, and doctors--Dr.\r\nHume of the Navy, who is at Bethesda, Commander Boswell from the U.S.\r\nNavy Medical School at Bethesda, Colonel Finck, Chief of the Wound\r\nBallistics Pathology of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are those the autopsy surgeons?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; that is my understanding. Dr. Olivier, from\r\nEdgewood Arsenal, Dr. Light, from Edgewood Arsenal, were present also\r\nwith Dr. Humes and the others, on April 14.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any individuals who were present at the motorcade\r\nitself ever have an opportunity to view the films and slides?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; on April 21, films were again viewed by\r\nrepresentatives of the Commission and the FBI, and at that time Drs.\r\nGregory and Shaw, from Parkland Hospital in Dallas, were available,\r\nDrs. Light and Olivier, and a Dr. Dolce, and Governor and Mrs. Connally\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nAnd at all of the viewings, they were again reviewed frame by frame,\r\nstudied by the doctors to tie it in with their findings, studied by the\r\nParkland doctors, and studied by the Connallys, to try to tie in where\r\nthe shots occurred along the film.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you an album which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 885.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 885 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask you to state what that album depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is an album that I prepared of black and white\r\nphotographs made of the majority of the frames in the Zapruder film----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Starting with what frame number?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Starting with frame 171, going through frame 334.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And why did you start with frame 171?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is the frame that the slides start from. This was\r\nan arbitrary frame number that was decided on as being far enough back\r\nto include the area that we wanted to study.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that a frame where President Kennedy comes into full\r\nview after the motorcade turns left off of Houston onto Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how was the ending point of that frame sequence, being\r\nNo. 334, fixed?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It was fixed as several frames past the shot that hit\r\nthe President in the head. Frame 313 is the frame showing the shot to\r\nthe President's head, and it ends at 334.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other photographs in that album in addition\r\nto the Zapruder frames?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there are. There are six photographs selected\r\nat random from the Nix film, including frame 24, which is a frame\r\ndepicting the shot to the head of the President, and there are three\r\nphotographs picked at random from the Muchmore film, including frame\r\n42, which is the frame depicting the head shot. These are the pictures\r\nthat were used in establishing the location of the Nix and Muchmore\r\ncameras on location in Dallas. Frame 10, which is the first one of the\r\nNix series, is the one showing Mr. Zapruder standing on the projection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where was the viewing of the films and slides\r\nundertaken?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. They have been viewed here at the Commission--all those\r\nin addition to the ones I have made personally in the FBI Laboratory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that down on the first floor of the VFW Building\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there any model available adjacent to the area\r\nwhere the films were shown, for use in re-creating or reconstructing\r\nthe assassination events?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; the model was available and used.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the model which has been described earlier this\r\nafternoon by Inspector Gauthier?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present on May 24 in Dallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, was done at the site of the\r\nassassination on that date?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On May 24, 1964, representatives of the Commission,\r\nSecret Service, and FBI reenacted the assassination, relocated specific\r\nlocations of the car on the street based on the motion pictures, and in\r\ngeneral staged a reenactment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present at that time representing the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The Commission was represented by Mr. Rankin, Mr.\r\nSpecter, and Mr. Redlich.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present at that time from the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I was present, Inspector Gauthier was present,\r\nInspector J. R. Malley was present, Special Agent R. A. Frazier was\r\npresent, with some aids, assistants.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Other aids from the FBI were also present?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; in addition, there were several agents from the\r\nDallas office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who assisted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were there representatives of the Secret Service\r\nparticipating in that onsite testing?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there were. Inspector Kelley was present, Agent\r\nJohn Howlett was present, the driver of the car, or the Secret Service\r\nagent whose name I do not recall----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. George Hickey?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what time did the onsite test start?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. They started at 6 o'clock Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why was that time selected?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The time was selected because of the traffic in the\r\narea. The Dallas Police Department recommended that that would be the\r\nmost logical time to do it, causing the least problem with traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time did the onsite tests conclude?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. They concluded about 1 o'clock, 12:45 to 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any subsequent testing done in Dallas on that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where was that testing undertaken?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. There was some testing done in a railway express agency\r\ngarage nearby the assassination site.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time did that start?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That started at 3 p.m., and lasted until 5:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were the various individuals positioned who\r\nparticipated in these onsite tests at the outset, at, say, 6 a.m., on\r\nthe 24th of May?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. At the very beginning, at 6 a.m., Mr. Rankin and\r\nMr. Specter were in the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, which is the southeast corner of the building,\r\nsixth floor window, which was referred to as our control point, and\r\nwhere we had the master radio control for the other units.\r\n\r\nMr. Redlich was on the street with the car. At the car on the street\r\nwere the occupants of the car, the Secret Service driver, Mr. Hickey,\r\nan agent from the FBI, who handled radio contact with control, Agents\r\nAnderton and Williams in the President's and Connally's seats, Mr.\r\nGauthier and his aids, a surveyor, and I, were all on the ground in the\r\nvicinity of the car.\r\n\r\nAgent Frazier was in the window of the Book Building at the control\r\npoint with the rifle that was found at the window following the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was that rifle found at the window or in another\r\nlocation on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. In another location on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that is the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle which was\r\nheretofore identified as Commission Exhibit No. 139?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were you positioned on most of the occasions at\r\nthe time of the onsite tests?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. For the first portion of them, I was at the car in the\r\nstreet, and at the position of Mr. Zapruder, the position from which he\r\ntook his pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What communications were available, if any, among the\r\nparticipants at the various locations heretofore described?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We had radio contact between all points.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the starting position of the car at the most\r\neasterly position on Elm Street, immediately after turning off Houston\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The first position we established that morning was\r\nframe 161.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there not a position established prior in sequence to\r\nframe 161, specifically that designated as position A?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That was actually established later. But the first one\r\nto be actually located was 161. And we went back later and positioned\r\npoint A.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, let's start with the position which is the most\r\neasterly point on Elm Street, which I believe would be position A,\r\nwould it not?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you a photographic exhibit depicting that position?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; in each of the positions that we established,\r\nwe used, insofar as possible, the Zapruder pictures to establish the\r\nposition, or we established it from the window, and made photographs\r\nfrom the position Mr. Zapruder was standing in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This chart has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 886.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 886 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This shows the photograph that was made from the point\r\nwhere Zapruder was standing looking toward the car, and is a point that\r\nwe have designated as position A because it is in a position that did\r\nnot appear on the Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nThe Zapruder film does not start until the car gets farther down Elm\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is that exhibit number?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Exhibit No. 886.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And why was that location selected for the position of the\r\ncar?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This location was selected as the first point at which\r\na person in the sixth floor window of the Book Building at our control\r\npoint could have gotten a shot at the President after the car had\r\nrounded the corner from Houston to Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what position is station C?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Station C is on a line drawn along the west curb line\r\nof Houston Street in a direct line, and station C is at a point along\r\nthat line that is in line with where the car would have turned coming\r\naround that corner. It is on a line which is an extension of the west\r\ncurb line of Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is position A on that chart?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Position A is here.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is before you get to the tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; he isn't under the tree yet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what occupant, if any, in the car is position A\r\nsighted on for measuring purposes?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. All of the photographs made through the rifle sight\r\nthat are shown on the exhibit in the lower left-hand corner were\r\nsighted on the spot that was simulating the spot where the President\r\nwas wounded in the neck. The chalk mark is on the back of the coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say that position A is the first position at\r\nwhich President Kennedy was in view of the marksman from the southeast\r\nwindow on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository Building, you\r\nmean by that the first position where the marksman saw the rear of the\r\nPresident's stand-in?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that would be the first position where the marksman\r\ncould focus in on the circled point where the point of entry on the\r\nPresident was marked?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could the marksman then have taken a shot at the President\r\nat any prior position and have struck him with the point of entry on\r\nthat spot, on the base of the President's neck?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I don't quite understand the question.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any prior position, that is a position before\r\nposition A, where the marksman from the sixth floor could have fired\r\nthe weapon and have struck the President at the known point of entry at\r\nthe base of the back of his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; because as the car moves back, you lose sight of\r\nthe chalk mark on the back of his coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the distance between that point on the\r\nPresident and station C?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is 44 feet from station C--91.6 feet to the rifle\r\nin the window from the actual chalk mark on the coat. All measurements\r\nwere made to the chalk mark on the coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the coat of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The President's stand-in?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Right. The angle to the rifle in the window was 40°10´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the other data?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The distance to the overpass was 447 feet, and\r\nthe angle to the overpass was minus O°27´; that is, 27´ below the\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there? How did you establish the\r\nlocation of the rifle in making those calculations?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The location of the rifle was established on the basis\r\nof other testimony and information furnished to us by the Commission,\r\nphotographs taken by the Dallas Police Department immediately after the\r\nassassination, and the known opening of the window.\r\n\r\nIt was an estimation of where the rifle most likely was based on the\r\nknowledge that the Commission has through testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Senator Cooper, Mr. Frazier is present and has been sworn,\r\nand he is going to identify that. He could do it at this time, to\r\npinpoint that issue.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think we can just make a note of that, and go ahead\r\nwith this witness.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine. We will proceed then with this witness and Mr.\r\nFrazier will testify in due course.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I might say that this position was determined by Mr.\r\nFrazier in the window. We moved the car around until he told us from\r\nthe window, viewing through the rifle, the point where he wanted the\r\ncar to stop. And he was the one in the window that told us where the\r\npoint A was. Once we established that, we then photographed it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could he see the mark on the back of the coat from the\r\nwindow?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; through the rifle scope, he could see the mark.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the picture designated \"photograph through rifle\r\nscope\" depict the actual view of the rifleman through the actual\r\nMannlicher-Carcano weapon?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. At point A.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When Mr. Frazier testifies, then, will he correlate\r\nthis photograph with a frame from photographs taken of the actual\r\nmotorcade at the time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; we cannot correlate this with a frame from the\r\nmotion picture because Mr. Zapruder didn't start taking pictures until\r\nthe car had passed this point.\r\n\r\nSo we, therefore, on this frame and for the next two or three points,\r\nhave no picture from Mr. Zapruder, since he wasn't taking pictures at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nDo I understand that you are not suggesting that a shot was necessarily\r\nfired at this point A, but this was the first point where this\r\nparticular vision of the President's back could have been obtained?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. It is only an arbitrary point showing\r\nthe first possible shot that could have entered the President's coat at\r\nthis chalk mark.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What criteria did you use for determining that you\r\ncould see the chalk mark? Was the criteria a part or the whole of the\r\nchalk mark?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The actual manner in which it was set up--let me see if\r\nthis answers your question. As we moved the car around, Mr. Frazier was\r\nin the window looking through the actual scope of the rifle, and could\r\nsee very clearly the President or the man taking the President's place,\r\nas the car moved around.\r\n\r\nAnd the instant that he could first see that chalk mark is the point\r\nwhere he radioed to us to stop the car, and is the first point at which\r\na shot could be fired that would go in where the chalk mark is located.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And that is point A?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is point A. Does that answer your question?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it does. Is that picture in the lower\r\nleft-hand corner of Exhibit No. 886 an actual photograph taken through\r\nthe sight of the weapon that was allegedly used in the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the chalk mark we see there is through that\r\nsight?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. And that is exactly what an individual\r\nlooking through the sight would see.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then at point A, could the rifleman see the entire back\r\nof the President's stand-in as well as the specific chalk mark, as\r\ndepicted on the exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. He could see only a portion of the back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the portion, which he could not see, is that which is\r\nbelow the seat level?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't say the President's stand-in, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; stand-in.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaneyfelt, for purposes of illustration would you produce the\r\nphotograph at this time showing the mounting of the motion picture\r\ncamera on the weapon found on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nI now hand you a photograph which is being marked as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 887 and ask you to state for the record who that is a picture of,\r\nand what else is in the photograph.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 887 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Commission Exhibit No. 887 is a picture of me that was\r\ntaken on May 24, 1964. My location was at the sixth floor window of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository that we have designated as our control\r\npoint. I have the rifle that is the assassination rifle mounted on a\r\ntripod, and on the rifle is mounted an Arriflex 16-mm. motion picture\r\ncamera, that is alined to take photographs through the telescopic sight.\r\n\r\nThis Arriflex motion picture camera is commonly known as a reflex\r\ncamera in that as you view through the viewfinder a prism allows\r\nyou to view directly through the lens system as you are taking your\r\nphotographs so that as I took the photographs looking into the\r\nviewfinder I was also looking through the scope and seeing the actual\r\nimage that was being recorded on the film.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the view recorded on the film as shown on Exhibit No.\r\n886 the actual view which would have been seen had you been looking\r\nthrough the telescopic sight of the Mannlicher-Carcano itself?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you determine the level and angle at which to hold\r\nthe rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I placed the rifle in the approximate position based\r\non prior knowledge of where the boxes were stacked and the elevation\r\nof the window and other information that was furnished to me by\r\nrepresentatives of the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You used the same boxes, did you, that the assassin had\r\nused?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were those boxes used by Mr. Frazier.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. They were used by Mr. Frazier and used in making the\r\nmeasurements. I had to use a tripod because of the weight of the camera\r\nand placed the elevation of the rifle at an approximate height in a\r\nposition as though the boxes were there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Mr. Frazier present at the time you positioned the\r\nrifle on the tripod?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he assist in describing for you or did you have\r\nan opportunity to observe the way he held a rifle to ascertain the\r\napproximate position of the rifle at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, we will, with Mr.\r\nFrazier, indicate, the reasons he held the rifle in the way he did\r\nto approximate the way we believe it was held at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nWhat is the next position which has been depicted on one of your\r\nexhibits, please.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The next position that we established during the\r\nreenactment is frame 161 of the Zapruder motion picture film.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to mark that if you would as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 888.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 888 was marked for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This position which has been designated by us as frame\r\n161 and as Commission Exhibit No. 888, was established as the last\r\nposition that the car could be in where the rifleman in the window\r\ncould get a clear shot of the President in the car before the car went\r\nunder the covering of the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How was that position located, from the ground or from the\r\nsixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This was positioned by Mr. Frazier in the sixth floor\r\nwindow. In addition we knew from the Zapruder photographs the relative\r\nposition of the car in the street as related to the curb and the\r\nguidelines or the lane lines.\r\n\r\nFollowing those lane lines we then moved the car down to a point where\r\nMr. Frazier radioed to us that it was the last point at which he could\r\nget a clear shot and we stopped the car there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you then select the appropriate frame from the\r\nZapruder film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. After Mr. Frazier had stationed the car at this\r\npoint, I then went to the position of Mr. Zapruder. Based on his\r\nmotion pictures, a comparison of the photograph that we made with the\r\nphotograph from the film, I was able to state that because of the\r\nrelative position of the car in the street and in relation to other\r\nobjects in the background, it corresponded to frame 161 of the motion\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have on Exhibit No. 888 a reproduction of frame 161?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; the upper left-hand corner is a reproduction of\r\nthe frame 161 of the Zapruder motion picture. The picture on the upper\r\nright is a photograph that I made with a speed graphic camera from\r\nZapruder's position of the car reestablished in that location. The\r\nphotograph in the lower left-hand corner, is a photograph of the view\r\nthrough the rifle scope that Mr. Frazier saw at the time he positioned\r\nthe car there. This is the view that you would obtain from looking\r\nthrough the rifle scope from the sixth floor window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the automobile in exactly the same position at the\r\ntime of the taking of the \"photograph through rifle scope\" and the\r\n\"photograph from reenactment\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; approximately the same. We went through all\r\nstations with Mr. Frazier in the window and I took photographs from Mr.\r\nZapruder's position, and once establishing a frame position, we marked\r\nit clearly in the street. After we had taken all of the photographs\r\nfrom Zapruder's position, we then took the car back, and went to the\r\nsixth floor window and mounted the motion picture camera on the rifle.\r\nThese photographs were made by rolling the car in the same position\r\nbased on the marks we had in the street so it was as accurate as could\r\nbe done in the same position.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is no one sitting in that right-hand corner of the\r\nrear seat, is there in that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; the person taking President Kennedy's place is\r\nsitting in the back seat.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; I see it. It is rather hard to see through the trees.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; we moved it up to a point where the chalk mark was\r\njust about to disappear on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I don't think I see the chalk mark maybe someone else can.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It may be covered by the crosshair of the rifle scope.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In that picture photographed through the rifle\r\nscope on Exhibit No. 888 a man standing in for Governor Connally is\r\nalso in the car, is he not?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. He is mostly hidden by the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; I see.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any difference between the position of President\r\nKennedy's stand-in and the position of President Kennedy on the day of\r\nthe assassination by virtue of any difference in the automobiles in\r\nwhich each rode?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; because of the difference in the automobiles there\r\nwas a variation of 10 inches, a vertical distance of 10 inches that\r\nhad to be considered. The stand-in for President Kennedy was sitting\r\n10 inches higher and the stand-in for Governor Connally was sitting 10\r\ninches higher than the President and Governor Connally were sitting and\r\nwe took this into account in our calculations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any allowance then made in the photographing of the\r\nfirst point or rather last point at which the spot was visible on the\r\nback of the coat of President Kennedy's stand-in before passing under\r\nthe oak tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there was. After establishing this position,\r\nrepresented by frame 161, where the chalk mark was about to disappear\r\nunder the tree, we established a point 10 inches below that as the\r\nactual point where President Kennedy would have had a chalk mark on his\r\nback or where the wound would have been if the car was 10 inches lower.\r\nAnd we rolled the car then sufficiently forward to reestablish the\r\nposition that the chalk mark would be in at its last clear shot before\r\ngoing under the tree, based on this 10 inches, and this gave us frame\r\n166 of the Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit number has been affixed to that?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is Commission Exhibit No. 889.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 889 was marked for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that 10 inches difference due to the difference in the\r\ntwo cars?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the President's--the car the President was in and\r\nthe car you had to use for this particular test?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On Exhibit No. 889, is the car in the same position on\r\nthe \"photograph through rifle scope\" as it is on \"photograph from\r\nreenactment\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct, the same position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the comparison between the photograph\r\nfrom Zapruder film on that Exhibit No. 889 and the photograph from\r\nreenactment?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The car is in the same position relative to the\r\nsurrounding area in both the reenactment photograph and the Zapruder\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the position that was used throughout all of the\r\npositioning of the car was the President's. His placement in the\r\nphotograph, and this will be clearer in some of the later photographs,\r\nif the President's head was directly under a stop sign or a street sign\r\nor whatever, in the background, this was then the way we positioned the\r\ncar with the person standing in for the President directly below or\r\nslightly to the side or directly below the stop sign and so on; so all\r\nof the calculations were based upon the position of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before leaving frame 161, finally, would you recite the\r\ndistances which appear from the various points on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nAt the position that has been designated as frame 161, and appears\r\non Commission Exhibit No. 888, the distance from the wound mark on a\r\nstand-in for President Kennedy to station C was 94.7 feet.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the rifle in the window was 137.4 feet, the angle to\r\nthe window was 26°58' based on the horizontal line, the distance to the\r\noverpass was 392.4 feet, and the angle to the overpass was minus 0°7´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are all angles calculated thereon based on the horizontal?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any street angle taken into consideration in the\r\ncalculations here?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there is a 3° street grade that has to be deducted\r\nfrom the angle to the window to determine the actual angle from the\r\nstreet to the window as opposed to the horizon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Frame 161 is 3° on 161?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Three degrees all along Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All along. That applies to all of these different pictures,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you now read the same statistical data from frame\r\n166 on Exhibit No. 889, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nFrom the chalk mark on the back of the stand-in for President Kennedy,\r\nto station C is 95.6 feet, the distance to rifle in window, 138.2 feet,\r\nthe angle to rifle in window based on the horizontal, is minus 26°52´.\r\n\r\nDistance to overpass is 391.5 feet. The angle to the overpass is 0°7´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the back of President Kennedy ever come into view at\r\nany time while he was passing through the foliage of the oak tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What frame number was ascertained with respect to that\r\nposition?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This was determined to be frame 185. There is a slight\r\nopening in the tree, where the car passed under the tree, where a shot\r\ncould have been fired that would have passed through this opening in\r\nthe tree. This again was positioned on the basis of Mr. Frazier in the\r\nwindow looking through the rifle scope and telling us on the street\r\nwhere to stop the car at the point where he could get a shot through\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit number has been assigned to frame\r\n185?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is Commission Exhibit No. 890, frame 185.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the \"photograph through rifle scope\" taken with the\r\nposition of the car at the same place as \"photograph from reenactment\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the \"photograph from reenactment\" in the same\r\nposition, as close as you could make it to the \"photograph from\r\nZapruder's film\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you read the statistical data from frame 185?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; from the point of the chalk on the back of the\r\nstand-in for the President at position 185 to station C is 114.8 feet,\r\nthe distance to rifle on window is 154.9 feet.\r\n\r\nThe angle to rifle in window based on horizontal is 24°14´, distance\r\nto overpass is 372.5 feet. The angle to the overpass is 0°3´ above\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any adjustment made for the difference in\r\nthe height of the automobiles on the location where the back of the\r\nPresident's stand-in was visible through the tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there was an adjustment made for the 10 inch\r\ndifferential in the heights because of the different cars, and this was\r\nestablished as frame 186.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit number is affixed to frame 186?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Commission Exhibit No. 891.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On Exhibit No. 891 is the car in the same position in\r\n\"photograph through rifle scope\" and \"photograph from reenactment\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the cars on those two pictures in the same positions\r\non all of the frames which you are going to show this afternoon?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the \"photograph from Zapruder film\", does that\r\n\"photograph from Zapruder film\" show the Presidential automobile to be\r\nin the same position or as close to the same position as you could make\r\nit as is the replica car in the \"photograph from reenactment\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you read the statistical data from frame 186, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nAt frame 186 position the distance from the chalk mark on the back of\r\nthe stand-in for the President was 116.3 feet from the station C. It\r\nwas 156.3 feet to the rifle in the window.\r\n\r\nThe angle to the rifle in the window was 24°3' based on the horizontal.\r\nDistance to the overpass was 371.7 feet. The angle to the overpass is\r\n0°3´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that position ascertained where the chalk spot on the\r\nback of President Kennedy's coat was first visible from the sixth floor\r\nwindow through the telescopic sight?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is after passing the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After passing out from under the oak tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What frame did that turn out to be?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That was frame 207.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an exhibit depicting the same photographic\r\nsequence on frame 207?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit number has been affixed to that\r\nframe?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Commission Exhibit No. 892.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the car in the same position on \"photograph through\r\nrifle scope\" and \"photograph from reenactment\" on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the car in the same position, as closely as you could\r\nmake it, on the \"photograph from reenactment\" and \"photograph from\r\nZapruder film\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now read the statistical data from that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes. Distance from the chalk mark on the back of the\r\nstand-in for the President to the station C is 136.6 feet.\r\n\r\nDistance to rifle in the window is 174.9 feet. The angle to the rifle\r\nin the window based on the horizontal is 21°50'. The distance to the\r\noverpass is 350.9 feet, and the angle to the overpass is 0°12'.\r\n\r\nThis is on frame 207, Commission Exhibit No. 892.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was an adjustment made on that position for the heights of\r\nthe automobiles?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the adjusted frame for the first view that the\r\nmarksman had of the President's stand-in coming out from under the tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is frame 210 and has been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 893 and represents the 10-inch adjustment for the\r\ndifference in the height of the car as compared with frame 207.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the layout of frame 210 exactly the same as that for\r\nframes 207 and 185 that you have already testified about?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In viewing the films on the frames preceding 210, what was\r\nPresident Kennedy doing?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. He is waving to the crowd, and in some frames it is\r\nobvious that he is smiling, you can actually see a happy expression on\r\nhis face and his hand----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which way is he turning, to the left or to the right?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. He is looking toward the crowd to his right during most\r\nof that area, he is looking slightly to his right. His arm is up on\r\nthe side of the car and his hand is in a wave, in approximately this\r\nposition and he appears to be smiling.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the latest frame count where, to your eye, it\r\nappears that he is showing no reaction to any possible shot?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Approximately--I would like to explain a little bit,\r\nthat at frames in the vicinity of 200 to 210 he is obviously still\r\nwaving, and there is no marked change.\r\n\r\nIn the area from approximately 200 to 205 he is still, his hand is\r\nstill in a waving position, he is still turned slightly toward the\r\ncrowd, and there has been no change in his position that would signify\r\nanything occurring unusual. I see nothing in the frames to arouse my\r\nsuspicion about his movements, up through in the areas from 200 on and\r\nas he disappears behind the signboard, there is no change.\r\n\r\nNow, 205 is the last frame, 205 and 206 are the last frames where we\r\nsee any of his, where we see the cuff of his coat showing above the\r\nsignboard indicating his hand is still up generally in a wave.\r\n\r\nFrom there on the frames are too blurry as his head disappears you\r\ncan't really see any expression on his face. You can't see any change.\r\nIt is all consistent as he moves in behind the signboard.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"signboard\" what do you mean by that, Mr.\r\nShaneyfelt?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I refer to the sign that is between the photographer,\r\nMr. Zapruder, and the Presidential car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Not any sign post between the rifleman and the\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; this is a sign between the cameraman and the\r\nPresident. So that we are unable to see his reaction, if any.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the frame at which Governor Connally first emerges\r\nfrom behind the sign you just described?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is frame 222.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you prepared a model demonstration on frame 222?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit number has just been affixed on\r\nthat frame?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Frame 222 has been given Commission Exhibit No. 894.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the location of the automobile fixed from the window\r\nor from the street on frame 222?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On frame 222, the position of the automobile was fixed\r\nfrom the street, based on the photograph from the Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the various photographs on that frame and the various\r\ndistances the same in terms of general layout as the prior exhibit you\r\ntestified to?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the first frame at which President Kennedy is\r\nvisible coming out from behind that sign?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is frame 225.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission Exhibit has been affixed to frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Frame 225 has been assigned Commission Exhibit No. 895.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, is detectable from a view of the\r\nZapruder film frame 225 as to the positions or reaction of President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Frame 225 there appears to be a reaction on the part of\r\nthe President. This is----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe specifically what movement he is making in that\r\npicture or what his position is?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. At frame 225 his hand is down, his right hand that was\r\nwaving is down, and has been brought down as though it were reaching\r\nfor his lapel or his throat. The other hand, his left hand is on his\r\nlapel but rather high, as though it were coming up, and he is beginning\r\nto go into a hunched position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say beginning to go into a hunched position is\r\nthat apparent to you from viewing the motion picture and slides from\r\nthe frames which succeed frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is primarily apparent from the motion picture\r\nbecause of the two or three or four frames that show as he emerges\r\nfrom the sign; that is, in the motion picture, you see the President\r\nreaching for his coat lapels and going into a hunched position, leaning\r\nforward and lowering his head.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That doesn't exist in frame 225 yet, does it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It is just beginning in frame 225. That is frame 225 is\r\nthe first view we have of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Out past the sign.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. As he comes out from behind the sign that obstructs the\r\ncameraman from the President.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But there is no obstruction from the sixth floor window?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT, No; no obstruction at this point. There is no\r\nobstruction from the sixth floor window from the time they leave the\r\ntree until they disappear down toward the triple overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do the photographs on frame 225 depict the same\r\ncircumstances as those depicted on the prior exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do the measurements on frame 225 cover the same\r\nsubjects as those covered on prior exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the angle from the rifle to the spot on the\r\nPresident's back on frame 210, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On frame 210, the angle from the rifle to the window,\r\nbased on the horizon is 21°34´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is from the rifle to what, Mr. Shaneyfelt.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. From the rifle to the chalk mark on the back of the\r\nstand-in for the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the same angle at frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It is 20°11´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Those angles are computed to the horizontal?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the range of distance from the position of the car\r\nin frame 210 to the position of the car in frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is 14.9 feet between frame 210 and frame 225.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the position of President Kennedy at frame 210\r\nwith respect to position C.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. President Kennedy is 138.9 feet from station C at frame\r\n210.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Station C.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; station C to President Kennedy on frame 210 is\r\n138.9 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the distance between station C and President\r\nKennedy at frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is 153.8 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the car further positioned at frame 231?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission exhibit number are we affixing to that?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is Commission Exhibit No. 896.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the photographs and measurements on 896 the same\r\nlayout as those affixed to prior exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the automobile stopped at frame 235 and similar\r\nphotographs and measurements taken?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission exhibit number is affixed to frame 235.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Exhibit No. 897.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the automobile again stopped at frame 240 with\r\nmeasurements and photographs taken similar to those in prior exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; it was. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission exhibit number is affixed to that frame?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Exhibit No. 898.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the automobile again stopped at frame 249 with similar\r\nphotographs and measurements taken?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what Commission exhibit number is given to those\r\ncalculations and photographs on frame 249?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Commission Exhibit 899.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as to frame 249, that is how many frames beyond the\r\nfirst point at which the spot on President Kennedy's back was visible\r\nafter he passed out from under the oak tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is 249?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It is 42 frames.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And does a 42-frame count have any significance with\r\nrespect to the firing time on the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; we have established that the Zapruder motion\r\npicture camera operates at an average speed of 18.3 frames per second.\r\nAnd we have been advised that the minimum time for firing the rifle in\r\nsuccessive shots is approximately two and a quarter seconds. So this\r\ngives us then a figure of two and a quarter seconds of frames; at 18.3,\r\nthis gives us this figure of 41 to 42 frames.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you repeat that again, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The camera operates at a speed of 18.3 frames per\r\nsecond. So that in two and a quarter seconds it would run through about\r\n42--41 to 42 frames.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Then the firing of the rifle, repeat that again?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. As to the firing of the rifle--we have been advised\r\nthat the minimum time for getting off two successive well-aimed shots\r\non the rifle is approximately two and a quarter seconds. That is the\r\nbasis for using this 41 to 42 frames to establish two points in the\r\nfilm where two successive quick shots could have been fired.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is with one shot and then the firing.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Work the bolt and fire another one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At frame 249 was Governor Connally in a position where\r\nhe could have taken a shot with the bullet entering at the point\r\nimmediately to the left under his right armpit with the bullet then\r\ngoing through and exiting at a point immediately under his right nipple?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; Governor Connally has begun to turn in his seat\r\naround in this manner, in such a way, turn to his right so that his\r\nbody is in a position that a shot fired from the sixth floor window\r\ncould not have passed through the path that it reportedly took through\r\nhis body, if the bullet followed a straight, undeflected path.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I don't quite get that. You mean because of his having\r\nturned this way, the shot that was then--had then been fired and\r\napparently had hit the President could not have gone through him at\r\nthat point?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct under the stated conditions. Even a\r\nshot, independent of the shot that hit the President, could not have\r\ngone through in that manner, coming from the sixth floor window,\r\nbecause the window was almost directly behind the automobile at that\r\ntime and the Governor was in a position where the bullet couldn't have\r\ngone through his body in the manner that it reportedly did.\r\n\r\nIt would have come in through his shoulder and out through the other\r\nshoulder, in the way that he was lined up with the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So you say it could have gone through him, but it could\r\nnot have passed through him with the angle of entry as disclosed in the\r\nParkland Hospital records and described by Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct, if it followed a straight path.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And exiting immediately under his right nipple, again as\r\ndescribed in the hospital records at Parkland and by Dr. Shaw.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have those points of entry and exit been made available to\r\nyou in your analysis of this situation?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; they have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you elaborate just a little further on the\r\nobservations and reasoning which you have undertaken to come to the\r\nconclusion which you have just expressed?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We are speaking of frame 249, are we?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir, frame 249.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Could I see that exhibit? The photograph in the lower\r\nleft corner of Commission Exhibit No. 899 is the photograph taken\r\nthrough the scope of the rifle on the sixth floor window when the car\r\nwas stationed in this frame number position. It is noted from this\r\nphotograph that the rifle is not quite directly behind the car but very\r\nnearly directly behind the car.\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally's body is turned. We have duplicated the position in\r\nthe Zapruder photographs of Governor Connally and the President in the\r\nreenactment photograph, as nearly as possible, duplicated the same body\r\nposition, and from the sixth floor window then you can see from the\r\nphotograph that the Governor's body is turned to the Governor's right\r\nin such a fashion that an undeflected shot would not go through in the\r\npath as described by the Parkland doctors.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I don't quite follow that yet. The President has been shot\r\nat frame 249, according to your theory.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Might he not also have been shot at some earlier frames\r\nin--the indications are the reactions are shown considerably ahead of\r\nthat frame.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. So, for example, at frame 237 and at frame 237 Governor\r\nConnolly hasn't turned to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But a shot has been fired at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But a shot has been fired at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. So at that point he could have been hit; Governor Connally\r\ncould have been hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; Governor Connally could have been hit by frame 238.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But your point is when he gets farther along, he couldn't\r\nhave been hit, let's say at frame 249 in the same spot where he was hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He made the turn later than those frames you have been\r\ndiscussing at the time apparently of the first shot at the President.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes; the first shot, but according to these frames, the\r\nfirst shot hit the President considerably before this.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And at a time again when Governor Connally's back was\r\nsquare to the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Well, not exactly square. I believe he was turned\r\nslightly to the right as he went behind the sign.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Take frame 231.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. There the President has got his hands up as you put it to\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And here is Connally facing to the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. So at that point a bullet coming through the President's\r\nthroat could have hit Connally in the spot where it did hit Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I am going to defer that question to Mr. Frazier who is\r\nin the window with the rifle scope and made a more thorough study of\r\nthe possible path of the bullet. But he is straight in the car in frame\r\n231.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But your testimony is in frame 248--frame 249 Connally\r\ncouldn't have been hit from this window in the position where he was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct, on the basis stated.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But, you would have then the problem you would think if\r\nConnally had been hit at the same time, would have reacted in the same\r\nway, and not reacted much later as these pictures show.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Because the wounds would have been inflicted.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is what puzzles me.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what puzzles me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would you identify the frame in which Governor Connally\r\nstarted turning to the right?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I might say that as--in the motion picture--as the car\r\ncomes out from behind the signboard, the Governor is turned slightly to\r\nhis right in this manner. This would be in the first frame, in frame\r\n222, he is turned just slightly to his right, and from there on he\r\nturns almost square, straight on with the car momentarily, and there is\r\na jerking motion there at one point in the film about there, at which\r\ntime he starts to turn this way and continues to turn.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Jerky motion in Connally in the film.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. There is--it may be merely where he stopped turning and\r\nstarted turning this way. It is hard to analyze.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What I wanted to get at--whether it was Connally who made\r\nthe jerky motion or there was something in the film that was jerky. You\r\ncan't tell.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. You can't tell that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Certainly the film is jerky at that point. I mean there is\r\na big blur.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. He does turn.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Just before and after that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But isn't it apparent in those pictures that after\r\na slight hesitation Governor Connally's body turns more violently than\r\nthe President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The President's only reaction is a motion to his\r\nthroat or to his neck with his hands.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Whereas Governor Connally actually turns his body\r\nrather sharply?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; he turns as they go behind the signboard, he turns\r\nthis way and he is turning a little bit this way and as he comes out of\r\nthe signboard he is facing slightly to the right, comes around straight\r\non and then he turns to his left straight on, and then he turns to his\r\nright, continues to turn around and falls over in Mrs. Connally's lap.\r\n\r\nBut in the motion picture it is a continuous movement as he goes around\r\nand falls.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Will you again answer my question which I asked and\r\nhasn't been answered and I say with all respect, in what frame did\r\nGovernor Connally begin to turn to the right after he had placed his\r\nposition straightforward as you have testified.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I am sorry. That starts approximately at frames 233 to\r\n234.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In what frame does the photograph show or in what frame\r\nis it shown that President Kennedy had moved his hands to his throat?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That shows on frame--it is clearer on frame 226, 225 is\r\nthe frame where you first see him, and frame 226.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How many frames between those two?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. From 26 to 33, eight. That would be a fraction of a\r\nsecond in time.\r\n\r\nThat is less than half second.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It can be contended that based on these\r\nphotographs of films that the first shot apparently was fired in frames\r\n220 to 224, in that area.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I think you have to go back even to 210 because of\r\nreaction times; we don't know reaction times. But I would say between\r\n210 and 225 because at 225 we have the President reacting.\r\n\r\nSo, in that 15 frames there it is behind the signboard, we can't see\r\nwhat is happening.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What frame first shows him with his hands at his throat?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. 225, 226.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. 225, it is not too clear. It is much more pronounced in the\r\nnext frame is where he puts his both hands to his throat, such as that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And Mrs. Kennedy has apparently turned around and looking\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. One hand may be coming down from waving in 225.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is his left hand there--no; it is his right hand, your\r\nright. His right hand.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Then based on the mathematics of how quickly\r\na second shot could be fired, the second shot would be fired in\r\napproximately what frame?\r\n\r\nIf you assume it, the first shot is from 210 to 224.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It would be 252 to 266, down in there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That would be the elapsed time of what?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Two and a quarter seconds.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Two and a quarter seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is the very quickest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On fixing the range from frames 210 to 225, where the\r\nPresident was first struck, did you take frame 210 because that was the\r\nfirst point after the President had passed out from under the oak tree?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; that is the first point from this, and although we\r\nare able to see in the films that there is no apparent reaction from\r\nthe President from 203 to 210, and as he disappears from behind the\r\nsignboard, we cannot estimate the reaction time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say reaction time you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Reaction time from 205----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. To 210?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there at frame 210, that is the first point at\r\nwhich the marksman had a clear shot after the President passed out from\r\nunder the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORM. Then you select frame 225 as the outside limit of\r\nthe shot which struck the President because that is where you first\r\nobserve a reaction by the President when he comes out from behind the\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What frames are blanked out because of the sign?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The President, the last we get any scene of him at all,\r\nand this is just the very top of his head is 210.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 210 to what is blanked out?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. 225.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To 225 is blanked out?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes, that is 15 frames.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. 224 he just begins to appear.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I don't think if you assume the President was hit at 225\r\nand I don't think that is clear at all. I think it begins to get clear\r\nabout 227 that he had been hit, that the reaction really develops. But\r\nI think that 225 it may very well be that he has not been hit because\r\nhis hand isn't at his throat, he may be just moving from the position\r\nof waving.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But that is about a tenth of a second.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes; it is a very short time entirely, but I don't think\r\nthe frame unequivocally shows the reaction to the bullet at 225. I\r\nthink it does unequivocally show it at 226 and 227.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Perhaps an additional question on the clarity of the slide\r\nitself as a point of reaction would be in order for Mr. Shaneyfelt, and\r\nthen, may I say parenthetically, we want to have the Commission see\r\nthese slides this afternoon.\r\n\r\nWe have prepared them to show to you so that you can observe for\r\nyourself what we are bringing to you through the witness to give you a\r\nframe of reference and an orientation.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaneyfelt, then what was your impression by frame 225, as you\r\nviewed it most recently this morning, with respect to a possible\r\nreaction on that frame made from the original Zapruder film?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It is my feeling that at frames 225, 226 and 227 you\r\nare having a reaction. You have a split second there, and at 225 the\r\nreaction is barely discernible, more discernible on the film and the\r\nslides than the reproduction you have here but it has to be considered\r\nin the light of the motion picture you see as he starts this reaction,\r\nand the reaction is by frame--in either the slides or pictures--is\r\nclearly apparent in 226, and barely apparent in 225.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was frame 249 selected as a situs for calculations\r\non the possible construction that President Kennedy was struck in the\r\nback at the first point unadjusted at which he emerged from the tree,\r\nto wit: frame 207, with an additional calculation of 42 frames giving\r\nthe approximately two and a quarter seconds for the firing of a second\r\nshot to determine through this one means whether there was time for the\r\nrifleman to have operated the bolt, assuming he made a shot at 207, and\r\nto have made another shot at the earliest possible time at 249.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That was the basis for the selection of frame 249, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going back just a moment, was frame 231 selected as\r\na basis for analysis as the first frame after 225 because Governor\r\nConnally expressed the opinion when he viewed the frames that he\r\nthought he was hit by or at frame 231.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was frame 235 selected as a basis of analysis because\r\nthat was one point at which a number of the viewers, including staff\r\nand agents of the FBI and Secret Service thought that might be the last\r\nframe at which Governor Connally had turned enough to the right to\r\nstill take a shot and have the bullet pass through his body from the\r\nsixth floor window at the angle described in the medical reports and by\r\nhis doctors.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct on the basis of an undeflected path.\r\nThat is the frame that the doctors selected as the frame beyond which\r\nhe could not have received this shot and have it travel in the path\r\nthat it reportedly traveled.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was frame 240 selected for analysis as being the\r\nabsolutely last time, based on the observations of those whom you have\r\ndescribed as seeing the films, that the Governor could have conceivably\r\ntaken a shot from the sixth floor window and have it pass through the\r\nbody of the Governor in the way described in the medical reports and by\r\nthe Governor's doctors?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the analysis, made on the ability of the Governor to\r\ntake the shot at each of the positions, based on the position he had\r\nat that particular frame in accordance with the amount of turn to the\r\nright which he had made at that particular time?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there a still photograph known as AP photograph,\r\nwhich was taken at the time of the assassination or a view seconds\r\nthereafter, studied by you and others in connection with the analysis\r\nthat you have been describing?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the simulated automobile placed in the same position\r\nthat the Presidential automobile was in when the photograph was made by\r\nthe AP photographer, as closely as it could be positioned at the time\r\nof the reenactment?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission exhibit number is attached to the\r\nphotographs of that AP shot and the reenactment picture?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is Commission Exhibit No. 900.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe what photographs appear then on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 900?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On Commission Exhibit No. 900, the top photograph is a\r\nphotograph purportedly made by an AP photographer shortly after one of\r\nthe shots. It depicts the side of the Governor's head, the left side of\r\nthe Governor's head, his ear is visible, he has turned considerably. It\r\ndepicts the President's hand touching his lapels, and a portion of the\r\nPresident's face.\r\n\r\nSecret Service agents on the followup car are seen also. The Texas\r\nSchool Book Building in the background.\r\n\r\nThe reenactment photograph was made after positioning the car by\r\nlooking at the photograph, based on the position of the car as related\r\nto the lane line in the street, as related to the position of the\r\nbuilding, the column of the building and so on to reestablish the\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nWe also reestablish in reenactment the position of the agent taking\r\nGovernor Connally's position in the car used in the reenactment and\r\nthe position of President Kennedy to closely approximate the actual\r\nphotograph made by the AP, Associated Press. This was then studied, the\r\ncar in this position was then studied, from the Zapruder position, and\r\nwas determined to be frame 255.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was an exhibit prepared then on frame 255?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission exhibit number is affixed to frame 255?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Exhibit No. 901.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that have the same layout of photographs and\r\nmeasurements as on frames 225, 222 and those which preceded them.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; it has. It has the Zapruder photographs, the\r\nmatching reenactment photograph, and the photograph through the rifle\r\nscope along with the measurements and the angles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the AP photograph shown on Commission Exhibit No. 900,\r\nwhat reaction, if any, do you observe by the Secret Service agents on\r\nthe followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The Secret Service agents on the right-hand side of\r\nthe followup car are looking back and to their right. The one to the\r\nfront on the left-hand side of the car is looking generally toward the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe one in back of him on the left fender is looking slightly to his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the distance on frame 255 between the\r\nPresident and the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The distance to the rifle in the window is 218 feet.\r\nThis is frame 255, which is well past the signboard, well past 249\r\nwhich is the last frame we considered.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Well past the first evidence of reaction?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. On the part of the President to a shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Well past, and past the point in the film where\r\nGovernor Connally states he has been hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that simulated car placed in any other position to\r\nduplicate still a subsequent frame?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; the frame No. 313, which is the frame that records\r\nthe shot to the President's head, was recorded as frame 313 and was\r\nreestablished during reenactment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Commission number has been affixed to frame 313?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Commission Exhibit No. 902.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this exhibit organized in a somewhat different fashion\r\nfrom the prior frame exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you start with the photograph in the upper left-hand\r\ncorner and describe for the Commissioners, please, each photograph or\r\npicture which appears thereon and what it represents?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I might state first that all of the other\r\nphotographs were reestablished on the basis of the Zapruder film using\r\nreference points in the background of the pictures.\r\n\r\nAs is apparent here from the photograph of the Zapruder frame 313 there\r\nare no reference points. There is just a grassy plot. So there is no\r\nreference point on which we can reestablish the position of the car in\r\nthe roadway.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it was necessary to use the Nix film of the head shot\r\nand the Muchmore film of the head shot to establish this position in\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand photograph represents frame 24 from the Nix film, and is\r\nthe frame that depicts the shot to the head. We used Mr. Nix's camera\r\nand a print of this picture and stood in the previously determined\r\nposition of Mr. Nix when he took his photographs, and had them roll the\r\ncar down to a position so that the President's head was directly under\r\nthe point where Mr. Zapruder is standing on the projection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are describing the photograph on which side----\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On the---\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the viewer.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. On the upper left-hand side.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think you said right.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The upper left-hand photograph is the photograph from\r\nthe--taken from the frame 24 of the Nix film.\r\n\r\nThe photograph on the right, upper right, is the photograph taken at\r\nthe reenactment from the position where Mr. Nix was standing. We then\r\nproceeded over to the point that we had established as the position\r\nof Mrs. Muchmore, and using frame 42, which is a frame in her film\r\ndepicting the shot to the head, and using the steps and their relation\r\nto the President and the objects in the background in relation to the\r\nPresident as shown in this lower left-hand photograph, which is the\r\nMuchmore frame 42, we reestablished, we checked the position we had\r\nplaced the car in, based on the Nix photographs, and found that it\r\nconformed and checked out as being in a closely accurate position.\r\n\r\nThis is the basis used for establishing the position of the car. After\r\nwe had established that, through the Nix and Muchmore films, we then\r\nchecked it against the Zapruder photograph, which is the second from\r\nthe top on the left of Commission Exhibit No. 902, frame 313, which\r\nshows the explosion from the top of the President's head. Just to the\r\nright of that second picture down from the right, is the photograph\r\nmade at the reenactment from Zapruder's position.\r\n\r\nWe know from studying the films that just two or three frames before\r\nframe 313 we can see a little bit of yellow along the curb, and this\r\nchecks out because along this area of the photograph from the Zapruder\r\nposition of the reenactment is a yellow strip.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say this area you are referring to the yellow\r\narea which appears on the left-hand curb immediately to the rear of the\r\nsimulated car?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct, and this, therefore, checks out this\r\nas being a fairly accurate position for the car in frame 313.\r\n\r\nThis photograph then, the third down on the left, is a photograph\r\nthrough the telescope of the rifle of the car positioned in frame 313.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Would you read off those dimensions from that?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The dimensions from the surveyor on frame 313 of the\r\ndistance from the wound mark on the President's stand-in to station C\r\nis 230.8 feet.\r\n\r\nDistance to the rifle in the window is 265.3 feet. The angle to rifle\r\nin window is 15°21´ and this is based on the horizontal.\r\n\r\nDistance to the overpass is 260.6 feet, the angle to the overpass is\r\n1°28´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would the angle be considering the adjustment on the\r\nangle of the street?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It would be less 3° or 12°21´, approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say approximately is that because the adjustment\r\nis somewhat greater than 3°?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much is it exactly, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It is 3.9. It is almost 4.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Three degrees nine minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Three degrees nine minutes, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you have to make a similar adjustment to the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; because the angle to the overpass is based on the\r\nhorizontal. The overpass, you would have to add the 3°9´.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. From the overpass, is this an angle up or angle down?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is an angle down.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So it is an angle down in both cases?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say that you are reducing the angle of 15°21´ by\r\n3°9´ to an angle of 12°12´, is that as the shot passes through the body\r\nof the President?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. It is at that point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How was the speed of the camera ascertained, Mr.\r\nShaneyfelt?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We obtained from Mr. Zapruder, Mr. Nix, Mrs. Muchmore;\r\ntheir cameras for examination, and in the FBI laboratory exposed film\r\nin all three cameras, aiming, focusing the camera on a clock with\r\na large sweep-second hand. We then ran the camera at the speed and\r\nconditions as described by the people who used the cameras. We ran\r\nthrough several tests of film, and then after the film was developed it\r\nwas studied under magnification, and frames were counted for a period\r\nof 2 to 3 seconds or for the full running time, and averages were taken.\r\n\r\nMr. Zapruder has stated that his camera was fully wound. Most of the\r\nothers have stated their cameras were fully wound, so we were able to\r\nmore or less eliminate the very slow time that occurs when the cameras\r\nare approximately run down, and all of these things were taken into\r\nconsideration and were averaged.\r\n\r\nThe Zapruder camera was found to run at an average speed of 18.3 frames\r\nper second.\r\n\r\nThe Nix and Muchmore cameras were both found around 18.5 frames per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to ascertain the speed of the Presidential\r\nlimousine at the time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; because we were able to determine the speed of the\r\ncamera, and thereby accurately determine the length of time it takes\r\nfor a specific number of frames to run through the camera at this 18.3\r\nframes per second, and having located these frame positions in the\r\nstreet, we took the farthest distance point we had in the Zapruder film\r\nwhich was frame 161 through frame 313.\r\n\r\nThis was found to run elapsed time from the film standpoint which runs\r\nat 18.3 frames a second, runs for a total of 8.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis distance is 136.1 feet, and this can be calculated then to 11.2\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that a constant average speed or does that speed\r\nreflect any variations in the movement of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is the overall average from 161 to 313. It does\r\nnot mean that it was traveling constantly at 11.2, because it was more\r\nthan likely going faster in some areas and slightly slower in some\r\nareas. It is only an average speed over the entire run.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Over the entire run between what points?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Between frame 161 and 313.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; but where, could you place that on that chart, for\r\nexample?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And describe the points?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is frame 161 which is the frame where they have\r\njust gone under the tree, to frame 313 which is the shot to the head.\r\nSo that it is that distance there which is 136.1 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In referring to those points, will you specify what\r\nexhibit number you are referring to there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if we could mark those points on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of course, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nThat is Commission Exhibit No. 883, is it not, Mr. Shaneyfelt?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you take the first point Mr. Dulles has referred\r\nto and mark it as point X. I think we already have some letter\r\ndesignations in the early part of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Where is that point? What significance is that point? The\r\nfirst point?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This frame 161----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the first frame we have on the Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is only to get the speed and distance here.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It has no relation to any shots.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. No relation to shots. Speed and distance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It is the first frame we have where the marksman has his\r\nlast clear shot of the back of the President's neck before it passes\r\nunder the tree without adjustment. Is that correct, Mr. Shaneyfelt?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. What letter designations did you want?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mark 161, frame 161, with the letter designation X, if you\r\nwill, please.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. And 313?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With the letter designation Y.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. The record ought to show the two points are the point which\r\nyou merely calculated the speed at which the car is going, isn't that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Between those two points the car went at an average speed\r\nof 11.2 miles an hour?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. Between point X and Y on Exhibit No.\r\n883 the speed of the car was determined to be an average speed of 11.2\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How long did the car take to go that distance, do you know,\r\ntranslated into time?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. 8.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 8.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What motion pictures, if any, were taken during the\r\nreenactment?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. During the reenactment the black-and-white photographs\r\nwere made from Zapruder's position with a Speedgraphic camera and we\r\nalso took motion pictures with Mr. Zapruder's camera from Zapruder's\r\nposition with the car in the fixed locations as they were established\r\nwith the car just stationary in those locations.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing all those points and making these film records\r\nof it, we then had the car proceed along that Elm Street route at\r\napproximately 11 miles per hour, and filmed it with Mr. Zapruder's\r\ncamera loaded with color film from Mr. Zapruder's position and\r\nsimultaneously photographed it with Mr. Nix's camera from Mr. Nix's\r\nposition, and Mrs. Muchmore's camera from Mrs. Muchmore's position, and\r\nthis was done twice.\r\n\r\n(Off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The last question was about what movies and stills you\r\ntook?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We haven't discussed them all yet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any other movies taken or photographs taken in\r\naddition to those which you heretofore described?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; after positioning the car in the street at the\r\nspecific locations and making the movies with the Zapruder, Nix, and\r\nMuchmore cameras with the car running at 11 miles an hour on the route,\r\nI then went to the sixth-floor window and mounted the camera on the\r\nrifle, and photographs were made with black and white film motion\r\npictures of the car in the fixed positions from frame 161 through frame\r\npositions 313. The car was stopped at each position. The individuals\r\nand the car were positioned by Mr. Gauthier on the street using the\r\nZapruder pictures to reposition the individuals in the car, and motion\r\npictures were made of the car sitting in those various positions.\r\nAfter this the car was driven at 11 miles an hour along the route and\r\nphotographs were made through the rifle scope with a 16-mm. motion\r\npicture camera following the car as a target, as the car drove down the\r\nassassination route.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, there were three runs made on black and white film.\r\nThen color film was loaded in the camera and it was again photographed\r\non color film, 16 mm. with the car traveling at 11 miles an hour and\r\nthe scope of the rifle following the car as the target.\r\n\r\nThis completed all the photographs that were made at the assassination\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was a subsequent photograph taken in the garage which you\r\npreviously identified as the railway express garage?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you repeat, even though you have heretofore mentioned\r\nthem, the angles between the spot on the back of President Kennedy's\r\nneck which was marked with a white chalk mark and the muzzle of the\r\nrifle when the car was positioned at frame 210?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The angle, based on the horizontal at frame 210, to the\r\nrifle in the window was 21°34´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the comparable angle at frame 225?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. 20°11´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So what would be the average angle then between those two\r\npoints?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The average angle, allowing for the 3°9´ street\r\ngrade results in an average angle between frame 210 and frame 225 of\r\n17°43´30´´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that is the average angle from the muzzle to President\r\nKennedy as he sat in the car or President Kennedy's stand-in as he sat\r\nin the car?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. To the wound entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the average angle of 17°43´30´´ measured from the\r\nmuzzle to the President's body as the President would be seated in the\r\ncar?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is out on the street in those frame positions,\r\nyes. It is measured to the point of the wound on the back of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 903 and ask you if you know who the photographer\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; I took this photograph.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was that photograph taken?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. It was taken Sunday afternoon, May 24, 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there a white string which is apparent in the\r\nbackground of that photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the angle of declination of that string?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That string was placed along the wall by the surveyor\r\nat an angle of 17°43´30´´.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the surveyor make that placement in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. He did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the stand-ins for President Kennedy and Governor\r\nConnally positioned in the same relative positions as those occupied by\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally depicted in the Zapruder films?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; these positions were approximately the position of\r\nthe President and Governor Connally in the Zapruder films in the area\r\naround frame 225 as they go behind the signboard and as they emerge\r\nfrom the signboard.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the rod which is held in that photograph positioned\r\nat an angle as closely parallel to the white string as it could be\r\npositioned?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And through what positions did that rod pass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The rod passed through a position on the back of\r\nthe stand-in for the President at a point approximating that of the\r\nentrance wound, exited along about the knot of the tie or the button of\r\nthe coat or button of the shirt, and the end of the rod was inserted\r\nin the entrance hole on the back of Governor Connally's coat which was\r\nbeing worn by the stand-in for Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was Governor Connally's stand-in seated in the\r\nposition where the point of exit would have been below the right nipple\r\nat the approximate point described by Governor Connally's doctors?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a couple of questions?\r\n\r\nAm I correct in assuming that you have made these determinations about\r\nthe degree of the angle of the trajectory of the bullet at the time the\r\nPresident was struck, locating the position of the President in the car\r\non the one hand, and the location of the rifle at the time the shots\r\nwere fired?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The location of the wound, you mean the angle of the\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The angle----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You had to establish the position of the President at\r\nthe time the bullet struck him and the position of the rifle to make a\r\ndetermination about the degree of the angle of the direction?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. The positions in the car, their\r\npositions in the car, were based on the Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And you were able to determine what you think very\r\naccurately the position of the President in the car by the films that\r\nyou have examined?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Then the factor then, which is not determinate,\r\nexactly, then is the location of the rifle, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Upon what did you determine the location of the\r\nrifle--upon what factors?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The rifle was positioned in the sixth floor window of\r\nthe Book Building where the cartridges were found, and was determined\r\nfrom information furnished by representatives of the Commission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you have information about the location of certain\r\nboxes that were seen--were found--at the window after the shooting\r\noccurred?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct. Yes; we had photographs of the boxes\r\nand we were advised, of the approximate position in the window and how\r\nfar down the window was, the fact that some observers noted the rifle\r\nsticking out the window.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I want to ask you--you did have information from the\r\ntestimony of witnesses who said they saw the rifle protruding from the\r\nwindow?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We had this information furnished to us by the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And those facts, those locations were made known to\r\nyou, and upon that evidence did you locate the rifle, in making these\r\ncalculations?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That was the basis for the location of the rifle in all\r\nof our calculations.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Just one other question. Assuming that there might have\r\nbeen some variation in the location of the rifle, length of the window,\r\nthe breadth of the window, or that the rifle you used was held higher\r\nthan the rifle might have been, would it have made--how much variation\r\nwould it have made, in your judgement, in these calculations you made?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I don't believe that any movement of the rifle in\r\nthat specific window would alter our calculations to any appreciable\r\ndegree if you stay within that window, because our reenactment and our\r\nrepositioning of the bodies in the car based on the photographs is\r\nsubject to some variation, too, so we have variations throughout.\r\n\r\nAnd the variations from the position of the rifle at that particular\r\nwindow, I feel would be negligible.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. At every point where you made it, hypothetically, at\r\nleast, made the determination that at a particular point the President\r\nwas struck by a bullet, at that point the car and the President could\r\nbe seen from the window?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all I want to ask.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Even under the tree you still could see the car and the\r\nPresident through the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Shaneyfelt, did the surveyors calculate the angle and\r\ndistance from each position where the simulated car was stopped from\r\nthe President to the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are those figures reproduced in terms of distance to\r\noverpass, and angle to overpass on every one of the exhibits which also\r\ndepict distance to window, referring to the sixth floor window, and\r\nangle to rifle in window?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; they do. They are on all the exhibits.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now; is there any point on the overpass where the angle\r\nto the President's car or the angle to the President's stand-in seated\r\nin the simulated car, would permit a shot to be fired and to create\r\nthe wound in the President's neck, which has an angle of decline of\r\napproximately 17°, based on the information furnished to you by the\r\nmedical evidence, which we have asked you to assume, where that wound\r\ncould be inflicted on the President's neck without regard to the point\r\nof entry?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; none of the angles from the overpass are anywhere\r\nnear 17°. They range from frame 161 at a minus 7´, from horizontal, to\r\nframe 313 which is 1°28´. None of them are even close to 17°.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. From the exhibit that has been introduced, showing\r\nthe position of the car and the President at the time of the first\r\nshot--what was the distance from that point to the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The approximate location of the first shot----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Frame what?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Well, the exact frame has not been established, but\r\nit would be in the range from frames 207 to 225. At frame 207, the\r\ndistance to the handrail on a line of sight vision to the wound on the\r\nPresident is 350.9 feet.\r\n\r\nAt frame 225 the line of sight distance from the handrail of the\r\noverpass to the wound on the President is 334 feet.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What is the distance at those points to the window in\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Frame 207 line of sight distance from the wound to the\r\nwindow is 174.9 feet. This distance to the overpass from there is 350.9.\r\n\r\nOn frame 225, line of sight to the window is 190.8 feet as opposed to\r\nthe distance to the handrail on the overpass of 334.0 feet.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you yourself stand at the handrail of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Did I?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean, Mr. Shaneyfelt, by line of sight?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Straight line distance.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that what is calculated by the surveyor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. That is correct; by Mr. West.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there members of the testing teams that did go to the\r\nhandrail at the triple underpass to make observations?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; there were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. I am not real sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, those conclude my questions for Mr.\r\nShaneyfelt. If it please the Commission, I would like to call Mr.\r\nFrazier at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Thank you very much, Mr. Shaneyfelt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. FRAZIER RESUMED\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Robert A. Frazier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, you have appeared before to testify, but will\r\nyou at this juncture again give us the outline of your occupation and\r\nexperience?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I am a special agent of the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation assigned to the FBI Laboratory, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nI work in the firearms identification unit in the laboratory,\r\nmaking examinations of firearms, bullets, the effects of bullets,\r\ntrajectories, firing tests, powder pattern tests, and various other\r\ntypes of examinations.\r\n\r\n(At this point Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you appeared heretofore before the Commission to\r\ntestify about examinations which you have conducted of the clothing\r\nworn by President Kennedy, the clothing worn by Governor Connally,\r\nthe examination of the Presidential limousine and certain ballistics\r\ninformation?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate in the onsite tests at Dallas on May\r\n24, 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your position during most of the time of those\r\nonsite tests?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I was stationed at the window on the sixth floor of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building at the southeast corner of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far was that window open at the time the tests were\r\nbeing conducted?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I estimated it as approximately one-third. It was somewhat\r\nless than halfway open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the distance depicted on Commission Exhibit No.\r\n492, which has heretofore been introduced in evidence?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the distance open on that window about the same as that\r\nwhich you had it open at the time these tests were run?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I would say that this is very close. The window was\r\nplaced according to information already furnished to the Commission as\r\nto how much it had been opened at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you handle the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle during the\r\ncourse of the onsite tests?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The rifle previously identified as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n139?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what position--what was the basis for your positioning\r\nof that rifle during those tests?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To position the rifle, we selected boxes of the same\r\nsize and contour as boxes shown in a photograph or rather in two\r\nphotographs, reportedly taken by the police department at Dallas\r\nshortly after the assassination.\r\n\r\nWe placed these boxes in their relative position in front of the window\r\nspacing them from left to right, according to the photographs which\r\nwere furnished to us, and also placing them up against the window,\r\nwith one of them resting on the window ledge as it was shown in the\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In addition to the placement of the boxes, were there any\r\nother guides which you had for reconstructing the position of the rifle\r\nto the way which you believed it to have been held on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; there was one physical obstruction in the\r\nbuilding which could not be moved consisting of two vertical pipes\r\nlocated just at the left side of the sixth floor window. These\r\nprevented me or anyone who was shooting from that window from moving\r\nany further to the left.\r\n\r\nThe position of the rifle, of course, had to be such that it could be\r\nsighted out through the window, using the telescopic sight high enough\r\nabove the window ledge so that the muzzle of the weapon would clear\r\nthe window ledge, and low enough in position so that the bottom of\r\nthe window, which was only partially raised, would not interfere with\r\na view through the telescopic sight, which is approximately 2 inches\r\nhigher than the actual bore of the weapon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you position the rifle further, based on information\r\nprovided to you concerning the testimony of certain eyewitnesses at the\r\nassassination scene concerning what they observed?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; we attempted to put the muzzle of the weapon\r\nsufficiently far out the window so it would have been visible from\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, referring to Commission Exhibit No. 886, did\r\nyou view through the sight that depicted in \"photograph through rifle\r\nscope\" on the positioning of the Presidential limousine or the car to\r\nsimulate the limousine at position A?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; this would be the first position that an\r\nindividual in that sixth floor window could sight at the car due to the\r\ninterference of the window ledge of the building and the fact that the\r\nangle downward is limited by the partially lowered window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 888 and ask you if\r\nyou had the view depicted on the \"photograph through the rifle scope\"\r\nshown on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; this Exhibit No. 888 is frame 161, and is\r\nthe position at which I had the car stopped just before the spot,\r\nindicating the entrance wound on the back of the President's stand-in,\r\npassed into the foliage of the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Exhibits Nos. 889, 890, and 891, and ask\r\nyou if you had the view on each of those depicted in the \"photograph\r\nthrough rifle scope\"?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; Commission No. 889 represented by frame 166 is\r\nthe adjusted position to account for the fact that the Presidential\r\nstand-in on May 24 was actually 10 inches higher in the air above the\r\nstreet than the President would have been in the Presidential limousine.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you explain to us simply how you made those\r\nadjustments?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I mean how did you get him down 10 inches as a practical\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. They had marked on the back of the President's coat the\r\nlocation of the wound, according to the distance from the top of his\r\nhead down to the hole in his back as shown in the autopsy figures. They\r\nthen held a ruler, a tape measure up against that, both the back of\r\nthe Presidential stand-in-and the back of the Governor's stand-in, and\r\nlooking through the scope you could estimate the 10-inch distance down\r\non the automobile.\r\n\r\nYou could not actually see it on the President's back. But could\r\nlocate that 10-inch distance as a point which we marked with tape on\r\nthe automobile itself, both for the Presidential and the Governor's\r\nstand-in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Continuing with Commission Exhibit No. 890, represented by\r\nframe----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Hold that around so I can see it.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Represented by frame 185, this is the first or rather the\r\nonly position through the foliage of the tree at which a person from\r\nthe sixth floor could get a clear shot at the back of the President,\r\nand I had the car stopped at this position and then we determined that\r\nthis was frame 185 from the Zapruder films.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There are no heavy limbs in there of any kind, are there----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That would obstruct a bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. The tree--it is a live oak tree which retains its\r\nleaves all year around and the limbs at that point are relatively small.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you compare the appearance of the foliage on the\r\npictures taken by the Secret Service, about which Inspector Kelley\r\nearlier testified, with the appearance of the foliage on May 24?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was that comparison?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. They are so nearly identical that you could not really\r\npick out any difference between the foliage and the photograph taken\r\npreviously in November.\r\n\r\nIn Commission Exhibit No. 891, which is marked frame 186, this is the\r\nadjusted position to which the car was moved to accommodate the 10-inch\r\ndistance at which the actual wound in the President would have been\r\nlocated had the car been the actual Presidential limousine rather than\r\nthe stand-in car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you standing, seated, or kneeling at the time when\r\nthese photographs were taken and the sighting of the rifle was made by\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I was actually sitting on a carton with my left elbow\r\nresting on the boxes stacked in front of the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that position represent to you the most likely\r\nposition which the rifleman assumed on November 22, 1963, based upon\r\nthe positioning of the various boxes?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the eyewitness accounts as to how far the rifle\r\nprotruded?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, in all of the frames that you have described up to\r\nnow, did you position the automobile on the street or give instructions\r\nover the radio as to where the automobile ought to be stopped for those\r\nvarious sightings?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Commission Exhibits Nos. 892 and 893, and\r\nask you if you observed the views depicted in the \"photograph through\r\nrifle scope\" on each of those exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. On Commission Exhibit No. 892, also marked frame No. 207,\r\nthe car was moved forward under the tree to the point where the spot\r\non the Presidential stand-in's back just became visible beyond the\r\nfoliage of the tree. I had the car stopped at that point so that this\r\nphotograph could be made there.\r\n\r\nOn Commission Exhibit No. 893, also marked frame 210, we have the\r\nphotograph made at the adjusted position to accommodate the 10-inch\r\ndifference in height between the stand-in and the actual position of\r\nthe wound above the street and on the President's body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the alinement of President Kennedy's stand-in\r\nwith Governor Connally's stand-in at frames 207 and 210?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. They both are in direct alinement with the telescopic\r\nsight at the window. The Governor is immediately behind the President\r\nin the field of view. Was that your question?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Alinement of people?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could Governor Connally have taken a shot in the range of\r\nframes 207 to 210 which would have traversed his body with the entry\r\nand exit points being approximately what they were shown to be through\r\nthe medical records?\r\n\r\nPreliminarily, let me ask you if, for the record, you had seen or had\r\nmade available to you the contents of the medical records showing the\r\npoint of entry on the back of the Governor and the point of exit on the\r\nfront side of his chest?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't recall having seen the medical testimony.\r\nHowever, information has been furnished to me by Commission members as\r\nto the relative positions on the back and the front of the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you in addition had an opportunity to examine\r\npersonally the clothing worn by the Governor consisting of his jacket\r\nand shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the Governor's position then in frames 207 and\r\n210, was he lined up so that a bullet fired from the sixth floor would\r\nhave passed through his body in about the way that the entry and exit\r\nholes were described to you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I would say that this could have happened at these\r\ntwo frames.\r\n\r\nHowever, this would assume that the path of the bullet through the\r\nGovernor's body was the same as the path of the bullet before it\r\nstruck, that is, there was no appreciable deflection in the body\r\nitself. Since I have no actual technical evidence available to me that\r\nthere was no deflection, I can only say that it is a possibility under\r\nthe circumstances as set up in these photographs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You would state that as a possibility based upon the\r\nobservations you made and the facts provided to you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nI now hand you Commission Exhibits Nos. 894 and 895 and ask you if you\r\nsaw the photograph as depicted on the \"photograph through rifle sight\"\r\non those exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 894 is marked frame 222, and the photograph\r\nthrough the scope is the same field which I saw looking through the\r\ntelescope on May 24, 1964.\r\n\r\nThis is similarly true of Commission Exhibit No. 895--895 being frame\r\nNo. 225.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you Exhibits Nos. 896 and 897 and ask you if\r\nthe picture shown on \"photograph through rifle scope\" is that which you\r\nobserved at the times those pictures were taken.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. This Exhibit No. 896 is also marked frame No.\r\n231, and represents the relative positions of the President's and\r\nGovernor's stand-in on May 24.\r\n\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 897, which is marked frame 235, also represents\r\nthe positions of the Presidential and Governor's stand-in as I saw it\r\nfrom the sixth floor on that date.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Exhibits Nos. 899, 898, and 901 and ask\r\nif you saw the pictures or if your view was the same as \"photograph\r\nthrough rifle scope\" depicted on those exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; they are. In each case Commission Exhibit No. 898,\r\nwhich is marked frame 240, Commission Exhibit No. 899, which is also\r\nmarked frame 249, and Commission Exhibit No. 901, which is also marked\r\nframe 255.\r\n\r\nIn the \"photographs through the scope\" the individuals representing the\r\nPresident and the Governor are as they were positioned on May 24.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, assuming certain factors, Mr. Frazier, to wit: That\r\nthe President and Governor Connally were seated in an open automobile\r\nin the approximate positions taken by the President's stand-in and\r\nthe Governor's stand-in during the onsite tests, that a bullet passed\r\nthrough President Kennedy entering at a velocity of 1,900 feet per\r\nsecond striking 14 centimeters below the right mastoid process and 14\r\ncentimeters to the left of the right acromion process which is the tip\r\nof the right shoulder, that the bullet passed through a fascia channel,\r\nhitting no bones, and proceeded in a straight line, exiting through the\r\nlower one-third of his neck, passing out of his shirt at the position\r\nwhich you observed personally from your inspection of the President's\r\nshirt, nicking the knot on the President's tie in the way you observed\r\nfrom your examination of that tie; do you have an opinion as to whether\r\nit is probable, based on the fact which I have asked you to assume,\r\nthat a bullet could have gone through the President and missed the\r\ninterior of the limousine and all of its occupants between frames 207\r\nand 225?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I can give you my opinion based on this reconstruction, as\r\nI understand your question.\r\n\r\nAll of these things refer to the reconstruction and assuming\r\nparticularly that the path of the projectile to the President was also\r\nthe same path, the same angle as it went through his body and then on,\r\nand in that connection, yes.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the bullet had to strike in the car, either the car\r\nitself or an occupant of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a probable opinion of yours based on what you\r\nsaw during the tests and the facts I have asked you to assume?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it is, and in fact, I think it is rather--it is\r\nobvious when you look at the photographs themselves that the crosshair\r\nof the telescopic sight actually would give you the point of impact of\r\nthe bullet if the weapon is sighted in and if there is no change in the\r\nline of sight the bullet had to strike the cars shown in each of these\r\nphotographs which is frame 225 on this end of this series, and frame\r\n207 on the other end of the series.\r\n\r\nIt shows that there would be no chance for the bullet to miss the car\r\nat all if it had no deviation in its--if it had no deflection in its\r\npath.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to examine the car shortly\r\nafter the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I did, on the early morning of November 23, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The record will show you have testified about it\r\nheretofore, but will you again state at this juncture whether or not\r\nyou found any indication within the car that the interior of the car\r\nwas struck by a missile proceeding at a high velocity such as 1,775\r\nfeet per second?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; we found none.\r\n\r\nWe examined in particular the passenger's section, the rear seat area\r\nof the back of the automobile clear up to the back of the rear seat,\r\nthe rear seat itself, the floorboards and the back of the front seat,\r\nthe backs primarily of the jump seats, and other areas in the front of\r\nthe car, the windshield and the chrome and the front hoods and fenders\r\nand sides of the automobile and we found no evidence of a bullet impact\r\nhaving those characteristics you mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you also examine the windshield of the car, interior\r\nand exterior?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the chrome of the car on the interior and the exterior?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you also examine the front portion of the Presidential\r\nlimousine?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; we did. That portion, the dashboard below the\r\nwindshield and the dashboard in the area immediately under that were\r\nparticularly examined, because the rest of it would have been shielded\r\nfrom a shot due to the height of the dashboard and the height of the\r\nback of the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any of that area examined disclose any impact of such\r\na missile?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; not of a high velocity. Only the lead area\r\nsmeared on the inside of the windshield from a relatively light object\r\nwhich struck the inside, and did not even break the inside surface of\r\nthe glass, and then there was a possible bullet impact area at the top\r\nof the chrome to the right of the rearview mirror. This was made by a\r\nprojectile not having the weight or velocity of a whole bullet moving\r\nat, in the range of a thousand to 1,500 feet per second or more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the position of Governor Connally as depicted in\r\nthe Zapruder slides at frames 222 and 225, could he have taken a shot,\r\nassuming the firing point to have been the sixth floor of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building, which entered and exited from his body\r\nin accordance with the known medical evidence?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I have not made a very thorough study of the Zapruder\r\nfilm which I understand you mentioned in this particular question with\r\nreference to the Zapruder film itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We will take it with reference to the reconstructed\r\npositions of Governor Connally in frames 222 and 225, which you have\r\ntestified you did observe at the time the measurements and photographs\r\nwere taken.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say, yes, under the conditions that I mentioned\r\npreviously, that the reconstruction would represent the Governor as it\r\nwas in November, then he could have been struck anywhere in that frame\r\narea of from 207 to 225.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the same question in frames 231, 235, 240 and\r\nthereafter?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There is only one position beyond frame 225 at which the\r\nGovernor could have been struck according to the information furnished\r\nto me and from my examination of his clothing that he was struck near\r\nthe right sleeve seam and that the bullet came out through the inside\r\npocket of his jacket.\r\n\r\nAt frame 231 the Governor is, as I saw it from the window on that date,\r\nturned to the front to such an extent that he could not have been hit\r\nat that particular frame.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why not, Mr. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The angle through his body, as I measured it on the coat\r\nis approximately 20° from the right toward the left. On May 24 in our\r\nreconstruction I found that the Governor had turned farther to the\r\nfront from a position slightly facing the right than he was in at frame\r\n225. He had turned back to the front so that a shot which struck him in\r\nthis shoulder in the back----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the right shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Indicating the right shoulder near the seam would have\r\ncome out much further to his right than the actual exit hole described\r\nto me as being just under the right nipple.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would the bullet have passed through his body based on\r\nhis position as shown in frame 235?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In frame 235, which is Commission Exhibit No. 897, the\r\nGovernor in our reconstruction, according to the Zapruder film was also\r\nfacing too far, too much towards the front. The angle of the bullet\r\nthrough his body, assuming no deflection, would not have corresponded\r\nto the angle through his clothing or according to the information\r\nfurnished from the medical examiners.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the Governor's position in frame 240?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In frame 240 the Governor again could not have been shot,\r\nassuming no deflection of the bullet prior to its striking his body,\r\nfrom the window on the sixth floor because he is turned in this case\r\ntoo far to the right.\r\n\r\nNow, this obviously indicates that the Governor in between frame 235\r\nand frame 240 has turned from facing completely forward in the car\r\naround to the right to the point that a bullet entering his back on the\r\nright shoulder area would have exited in my opinion somewhere from his\r\nleft chest area rather than from his right chest area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the Governor's position at frame 249?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. In frame 249 a similar situation exists in that the\r\nGovernor, as represented by his stand-in in our reconstruction, has\r\nturned too far to the right, even further than frame 240, so that in\r\nframe 249 represented by Commission Exhibit No. 899, he again could not\r\nhave been hit by a bullet which came from the window on the sixth floor\r\nand struck him in an undeflected fashion and passed through his body\r\nundeflected.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about frame 255?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. On frame 255 which is in Commission Exhibit No. 901 the\r\nGovernor is turned again too far to the right, and the same situation\r\nwould hold true as to what we saw in frame 249.\r\n\r\nThe bullet would have exited too far on his left side, provided there\r\nwas no deflection between the window and the point of exit from the\r\nGovernor's body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Frazier, based on the angles, distances, and speeds of\r\nthe car and bullet in this situation, what lead would a marksman have\r\nto give to strike the moving target, allowing for all of those factors?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The lead would be approximately the same for all of these\r\npositions represented by your frame or rather your Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 888, which is frame 161, all the way up to frame 313 which I don't\r\nhave, the Commission's Exhibit is No. 902 on frame 313, a lead of 6\r\ninches above the point of impact would be sufficient to account for\r\nthe movement of the car during the flight of the bullet.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the same lead would be necessary at each place is because\r\nat the closer frame numbers, the lower frame numbers, 161, 166, 185,\r\nand so forth, there is a relatively steep downward angle beginning at\r\n40°, whereas the last shot, the downward angle is approximately 17° or\r\n20°, in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nJust one thing more, it would require less apparent elevation of the\r\ncrosshair over the point of impact at the distant target to allow for a\r\nfurther movement of the car of approximately 2 feet at the point where\r\nthe head shot occurred.\r\n\r\nSo the lead would be constant between 5.9 inches above the point of\r\nimpact to 6.3 inches above the point of impact.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you asked the witness--I was studying these frame\r\npictures--at about what frame he thinks the body of Governor Connally\r\nwould have been in a position to receive a bullet that would go through\r\nthe body with this trajectory?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; I believe I did.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wasn't quite clear.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I testified that it would have been in position from\r\nanywhere from frames 207 to 225.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot limit it to 207 because at that point the car goes\r\nback under the foliage and you can't actually see clearly enough.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Between frames 207 and 225?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; approximately frame 207 to approximately frame\r\n225.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Looking at Exhibit No. 902, frame 313, on the view shown\r\non the \"photograph through rifle scope,\" is that the way you saw it at\r\nthe time of the reconstruction, when the car was in that position as\r\nshown in that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At this time I move for the admission into evidence of\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 885 through 903 which constitute all of the\r\nphotographs referred to by Mr. Shaneyfelt and Mr. Frazier during their\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 855 through 903 were marked for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That completes the questioning.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. As I get it, Mr. Frazier, what you are saying is there\r\nis only a certain point at which the bullet could pass through the\r\nPresident, could have hit Mr. Connally, and that is at a point when he\r\nis not sitting full face forward and at a point when he is not too far\r\nturned around.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is exactly right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Somewhere when he is turning to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He was placed approximately 20° to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. To the right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is 20° according to my examination of his clothing\r\nbut I don't know the exact figures of the angle through his body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have one additional question.\r\n\r\nMr. Frazier, assuming the factors which I have asked you to accept as\r\ntrue for the purposes of expressing an opinion before, as to the flight\r\nof the bullet and the straight line penetration through the President's\r\nbody, considering the point of entry and exit, do you have an opinion\r\nas to what probably happened during the interval between frames 207\r\nand 225 as to whether the bullet which passed through the neck of the\r\nPresident entered the Governor's back.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There are a lot of probables in that. First, we have to\r\nassume there is absolutely no deflection in the bullet from the time it\r\nleft the barrel until the time it exited from the Governor's body. That\r\nassumes that it has gone through the President's body and through the\r\nGovernor's body.\r\n\r\nI feel that physically this would have been possible because of the\r\npositions of the Presidential stand-in and the Governor's stand-in, it\r\nwould be entirely possible for this to have occurred.\r\n\r\nHowever, I myself don't have any technical evidence which would permit\r\nme to say one way or the other, in other words, which would support it\r\nas far as my rendering an opinion as an expert. I would certainly say\r\nit was possible but I don't say that it probably occurred because I\r\ndon't have the evidence on which to base a statement like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What evidence is it that you would be missing to assess\r\nthe probabilities?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. We are dealing with hypothetical situations here of\r\nplacing people in cars from photographs which are not absolutely\r\naccurate. They are two dimensional. They don't give you the third\r\ndimension. They are as accurate as you can accurately place the people\r\nbut it isn't absolute.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we are dealing with the fact that we don't know whether, I\r\ndon't know technically, whether there was any deviation in the bullet\r\nwhich struck the President in the back, and exited from his front. If\r\nthere were a few degrees deviation then it may affect my opinion as to\r\nwhether or not it would have struck the Governor.\r\n\r\nWe are dealing with an assumed fact that the Governor was in front of\r\nthe President in such a position that he could have taken. So when you\r\nsay would it probably have occurred, then you are asking me for an\r\nopinion, to base my opinion on a whole series of hypothetical facts\r\nwhich I can't substantiate.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Let me put it to you in another way--from your best\r\njudgment about what you know about this thing, what was the sequence of\r\nthe shots, and who was hit, and when in relation to----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I will say this--I have looked at the film and have seen\r\nevidence of one shot occurring which struck the President in the head.\r\nThat was at frame 313.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Frame 313? Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Commission Exhibit No. 902. I have seen evidence in the\r\nfilm of the President with both arms up clutching at his throat, and\r\nhaving examined his clothing and having seen the hole in his shirt and\r\nhis back, I might assume that he is clutching his throat because a\r\nbullet exited from his throat. I don't have the technical knowledge to\r\nsubstantiate that. There was no metal on this hole in front, and there\r\nis no way for me to say from my own examination that it actually was a\r\nbullet hole. Nowhere else in this film have I seen any indication of a\r\nbullet striking.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The President?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Either the President or the Governor. Because I do not\r\nknow the reaction time which would exist from the time a bullet struck\r\nuntil someone made a move. It may be a half second, it may be a full\r\nsecond. It may be a tenth of a second. It depends upon the intensity of\r\nthe pain, and actually what happened.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, in looking at the film you can't say a bullet struck\r\nright here because he started to move his hands here. It may have been\r\na full second, a half second behind that spot. I would say that two\r\nbullets at least struck in the automobile. I cannot say that three\r\nbullets did not strike in the automobile from my examination, but it\r\nappears and due to the reconstruction at Dallas, it appears that if the\r\none bullet did strike the President, then it landed in the automobile,\r\nand if it landed in the automobile, and we found no evidence of it\r\nhaving hit the car itself, then I say it is possible that it struck the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the sequence of the shots, that one obviously was before the\r\nhead shot. If there was a third shot fired, I could not tell you from\r\nanything I know whether it was the first, the second, or the third.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It is possible, according to your analysis of it, that the\r\nfirst shot could have gone through the back of the President and exited\r\nthrough the front of his neck, and the second shot could have hit\r\nConnally, and the third shot could have hit the President.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where would the first shot have gone under that thesis?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I just say I don't know where it could have gone.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. From what I know from my examination that is true, because\r\nI have seen bullets strike small twigs, small objects, and ricochet for\r\nno apparent reason except they hit and all the pressure is on one side\r\nand it turns the bullet and it goes off at an angle.\r\n\r\nIf there was no deviation from the time the bullet left the rifle\r\nbarrel until the time it exited from the Governor's body, then the\r\nphysical setup exists for it to have gone through the President, and\r\nthrough the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean from the time it exited through the Governor's\r\nbody?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right. Otherwise, you have nothing to base a\r\nconclusion upon. If you have deviation anywhere along the line then\r\nyou both affect the position at which the Governor could have been\r\nshot--for instance--if the bullet entered the Governor's back and\r\nimmediately took a 20° leftward angle, then the Governor could have\r\nbeen shot when he was facing straightforward in the automobile.\r\n\r\nNow, I can't tell that, and therefore I can only say that my opinion\r\nmust be based on your assumption that there was not a deviation of the\r\nbullet through the President's body and no deviation of the bullet\r\nthrough the Governor's body, no deflection. On that basis then you can\r\nsay that it is possible for both of them to have been hit with one\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Does that opinion rule out the possibility or cast\r\ndoubt on the possibility of a third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It does not rule out the possibility of a third shot.\r\nNo, sir; because I can only base my opinion on what I saw and my own\r\nexperience, and that is that a bullet could have struck the President,\r\nif it had deflection in the President's body it could have, and he\r\nhappened to be in a certain position in the car which would affect the\r\nangle, the bullet may have exited from the automobile.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As I understood your assumptions there was no\r\ndeviation and no deflection, and I thought I phrased my question based\r\non your opinion under those facts, it might rule out a third shot.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you mean rule out a third shot entirely or just rule out\r\na third shot hitting in the car?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Rule out a third shot in one instance or establish\r\nthe possibility of a third shot that missed everything.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. As I understand your question I am now assuming these\r\nvarious factors to exist, that there was no deviation, no change in the\r\npath of the bullet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The bullet went through the President and through\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; then under that premise and the reconstruction\r\nshowing the position of the car with reference to the path of the\r\nbullet, then it is entirely possible that these two individuals were\r\nhit with one bullet and that there was not another bullet that struck\r\nin the car other than the one that struck the President in the back of\r\nthe head and exited from his head.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Under these assumptions there is a possibility\r\nthere was not a third shot or there was a third shot that missed\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That missed everything; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there any way of correlating the time of the shot with\r\nthe position of the car so as to know whether possibly the first shot\r\nwas fired before the car was out from the tree and it might have hit a\r\nbranch of the tree and be deflected so it didn't hit the car? If he had\r\nfired too soon. I guess it is impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It is possible, I don't have any evidence to support it\r\none way or the other.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. As to whether or not a limb of the tree may have deflected\r\none shot. However, I think it should be remembered that the frame\r\n207 is just as he exits under the tree; from there to frame 225 to\r\nwhere the President shows a reaction is only a matter of 1 second.\r\nHe is under the tree in frames 166 until frame 207, which is about 2\r\nseconds. So somewhere in that 3-second interval there may have been\r\na shot--which deflected from a limb or for some other reason and was\r\nnever discovered.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, may I return to questions that I was\r\nasking Mr. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Again making those same assumptions we made a\r\nmoment ago, is there any evidence that a third shot hit the car or any\r\noccupant of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Assuming all those assumptions we had before; no. I would\r\nsay that, and again I have not the technical evidence to back this up\r\none way or the other but you make these assumptions and I would say\r\nunder those conditions only two shots hit the occupants of the car\r\nbecause the one through the President had to cause Connally's wound\r\notherwise it would have struck somewhere else in the car and it did not\r\nstrike somewhere else.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it had to go through Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nAnd the second shot had to strike the President in the head.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. How about these shots you spoke of, one of the fragments,\r\nat least, hitting the glass, the windshield and one possibly hitting\r\nthe chrome. Was there anything, could it have been any fragmentation\r\nof the first shot which didn't hit, the first shot that hit the\r\nPresident, let's say, but didn't hit Connally, might that again make\r\nthe possibility of three shots, one of them hitting the President and\r\nfragmenting as you indicated, and a second one hitting Connally, and\r\nthe third one hitting the President for the lethal shot.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Under that circumstance the bullet exiting from the\r\nPresident would have had to strike something else in the car to break\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Break it up inasmuch as it was broken up?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; there was no evidence that the bullet which\r\nexited from the President was in any but complete condition, that is\r\nthere was only one hole through the shirt, there was only one hole\r\nthrough his coat or shirt actually and the testimony of the medical\r\nexaminers was that it made a relatively straight path through the body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That completes my questions of Mr. Frazier.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask just one more question?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir; Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There has been a certain amount of testimony indicating\r\nthere was a longer pause between the report of the first shot or what\r\nis believed to be the report, explosion of the first shot and the\r\nsecond and third shots, that is not absolutely unanimous but I would\r\nsay it is something like 5 to 1 or something of that kind, what would\r\nyou say, 2 to 1, 3 to 1?\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it possible that the assassin attempted to fire when the\r\ncar was behind the tree or going into the tree, that that shot went\r\nastray, and that that accounts for, if there was a longer delay between\r\none and two, that would account for it, and then the lethal shots were\r\nfired or the wound, the one shot that was fired that hit the two and\r\nthen the lethal shot was fired immediately after. It is speculation.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think that must be speculation because there certainly\r\nis conflicting evidence as to the intervals between the first and the\r\nsecond shot and the second and the third shot.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think if you will read the testimony you will find it at\r\nleast 2 to 1 except for the people in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Maybe, but what weight do you give these, I don't know. I\r\nthink that is quite possible that a bullet was deflected by that tree,\r\nbut there is no evidence whatever of the bullet landing anywhere in the\r\nstreet or among the crowd.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there seems to be no doubt at all that three shots were fired.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That seems to be the evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. At least three shots were fired, and probably three shots\r\nwere fired because of the three shells that were found.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Three shells?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We probably won't settle that today.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I don't know how to answer that question except possibly\r\nto go back to the frame numbers of the Zapruder film and you will find\r\nthey are about equally spaced from frame 161 just before the tree to\r\nframe, say, 220, which is just a few frames after the tree, that is\r\n59 or approximately 60 frames, from that point. But from frame 222 to\r\nthe last shot of frame 313 is 78 and 13, 91 frames, so there is more\r\ntime between the second and third than the first and second, assuming\r\nthat the second one actually occurred and that it occurred at about the\r\nmiddle of that interval.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In the middle of that frame, yes. I think that is pretty\r\npersuasive.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I didn't quite follow that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. There seemed to be more frames between, going backwards,\r\nbetween the third shot, that is between the time that----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The first shot went astray, you don't know whether it was\r\nfired. You have no way of getting at that.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Thank you very much, Mr. Frazier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I want to call Inspector Kelley for observations from the\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMay the record show that Inspector Thomas Kelley has returned to the\r\nwitness chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THOMAS J. KELLEY RESUMED\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before we conclude the testimony, Inspector Kelley, I\r\nwant to ask you if on May 24 you had occasion to go over to the triple\r\nunderpass and observe the simulated car and occupants drive down Elm\r\nStreet from Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; I accompanied Mr. Redlich and Mr. Specter from the\r\nCommission on the point on the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the Commission or from where to the overpass--pardon\r\nme. I understand your sequence there.\r\n\r\nWhat did you observe as to the position of the President's stand-in\r\nconcerning whether he could have been struck by a bullet which was\r\nfired from the top of the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. I observed as the car came down Elm Street that the\r\nPresident's stand-in was in our view all the time as he was coming\r\ndown the street from the right-hand side of the car. As the more you\r\nmoved over to the left of the underpass, the longer the stand-in was in\r\ndirect view of anybody standing on the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the stand-in obstructed by the windshield at\r\nanytime as the car drove down Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. No; he was not. However, never at any time was he in a\r\nposition to take a wound in the throat which from the drawings that\r\nhave been given me, that I have been shown by the Commission, would\r\nhe take a wound in the throat which would have exited higher than the\r\nthroat or in the shoulder.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence that has been shown previously, the wound in the\r\nthroat was lower on the President's body than the wound in the\r\nshoulder, and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By the wound in the shoulder do you mean the wound in the\r\nback of the President's neck, the base of his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, could a shot have been fired from the top of the\r\ntriple underpass which would have passed through the President's neck,\r\ndisregarding the medical evidence on point of entry, which traveled in\r\nan upward direction from the front of his neck upward to the back of\r\nhis neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. In my judgment, no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If a person were standing where you have indicated\r\nyou were on that triple overpass, on November 22, he would have been in\r\nfull view of anybody in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Yes; and there were people on the overpass. There was a\r\npoliceman on the overpass, there were a number of railroad workmen on\r\nthe overpass at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There would have been no place where such a person\r\ncould have hidden himself and not been detected?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. Not on the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What were the railway workmen doing on the overpass, were\r\nthey helping to guard the overpass or just spectators?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. No; they were working. There are a great many tracks\r\nindicated here.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; I was up there and I remember it very well.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLEY. They were doing some repairs on the tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I had the impression there was more than one policeman also\r\nguarding up there, at least two, but maybe I am wrong. At least there\r\nis some testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you recall, Mr. Specter, what the testimony is on\r\nthat--the number of policemen on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I believe there were two officers on the overpass, who\r\nsaid that no shots came from that direction.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No shots came from that direction. Is that all you wanted?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That completes the testimony of Mr. Kelley and all of the\r\nindividuals this afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Thank you very much, Mr. Kelley.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 6:40 p.m., the President's Commission recessed to view\r\nthe films.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LYNDAL L. SHANEYFELT RESUMED\r\n\r\n(Present were Mr. McCloy, Mr. Dulles, and Representative Ford)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record now show that the Commission has now\r\nreassembled on the first floor of the VFW Building where a motion\r\npicture projector and slide projector and screen have been set up for\r\nviewing of the films.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaneyfelt, what are you going to show us first of all?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The first film will be of the color motion picture made\r\nthrough the rifle scope as the car drove down the assassination route\r\nat approximately 11 miles an hour. It will give the view the rifleman\r\nhad as he aimed the rifle from the sixth floor window of the Book\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that going 11 miles per hour?\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This film will be the black and white photographs of\r\nthe car in the fixed still positions in each of the frame numbers\r\ndescribed in previous testimony.\r\n\r\nIn addition the final portion of the film is a run through of the car\r\nat 11 miles an hour on three separate runs filmed as the rifleman would\r\nhave seen the car looking through the rifle.\r\n\r\nOn the first run of the car going down the assassination route I have\r\nstained frames in the vicinity of frame 222 which is after the first\r\nclear shot after the tree, I have stained the frame at the location of\r\nshot 313, which is the second pink flash you will see.\r\n\r\nI found, in examining the film, that this is a shorter span of time\r\nthan in the actual film. It is a span on the reenactment of about three\r\nand a half seconds between 222 and 313.\r\n\r\nThe second frame stained is 313 but since it is running at a faster\r\nspeed I have also stained a spot that represents 5 seconds which is\r\nwhat the time lapse was between frame 222 and frame 313 in the actual\r\nassassination films.\r\n\r\nThat will be after the car driving scene.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is the last clear shot and this is an adjusted\r\nlast clear shot before going under the tree. This is the shot\r\napproximately 185. This is frame 186 which is the adjusted shots which\r\nwould account for a 10-inch variance.\r\n\r\nShot of frame 207, and the adjusted frame which was 210. This is frame\r\n222 and you can see the tree is still in the background.\r\n\r\nThis is 225 now. 231. At this point Governor Connally states he has\r\nbeen hit by now. This is 235. 240--249--255--and the shot to the head\r\nwhich is 313.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is this? Describe this, Mr. Shaneyfelt.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is the run at 11 miles an hour containing the pink\r\nstain. This is another run at 11 miles an hour. It will give you some\r\nidea of the difficulty of tracking a car with a heavy camera mounted\r\non the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You have to sight that with a camera?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Sighting through a camera.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Just as a final thing, Mr. McCloy, would you like to see\r\nthe Zapruder film?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think we will take the original Zapruder again, I don't\r\nknow whether we have anything that is more significant in the black and\r\nwhites, I am talking about the particular movies of the frames, we have\r\nnot seen those.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I think we have seen all we need to see with regard to\r\nthat. What have you got left?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. The original Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We will see that.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We have the duplication of the Zapruder film\r\nreenactment. The first portion of the reel is the still shots and the\r\nlast portion is the run through at 11 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I think you would find that worth while to see.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Then we have Nix and Muchmore of the same run.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Let's do those, too.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. First is the original Zapruder.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Original Zapruder. This is not the original. This is\r\nthe first copy.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state for the record what film we just saw?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This film we just viewed is a copy made directly from\r\nthe original Zapruder film of the actual assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you now show us the film which was taken at the\r\nreconstruction from the Zapruder position?\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. These films we made in Dallas have been developed and\r\nleft intact and have not been edited in any way so there are a lot of\r\nblank spaces where we run the leader off and turn the film. This is\r\nposition 161. This side-to-side jiggle is a camera malfunction.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. This is 16 mm.?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No; 8 mm.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this from his camera?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes; taken with his camera. Frame 222, frame 225. This\r\nis frame 231.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He has a delayed reaction compared to what the\r\nPresident did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What frame is this, Mr. Shaneyfelt?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. 313, the head shot.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. The head shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is the position which is not duplicated on the\r\nZapruder film. This is running the film out to reload it.\r\n\r\nDuring that run at 11 miles an hour we made no effort to duplicate the\r\nbody position because it would have been most difficult to know just\r\nwhen to turn. The only other films we have are the ones we shot with\r\nthe Nix and Muchmore cameras of this same run from their positions.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did Nix, Muchmore get a second shot of the head shot?\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Mrs. Muchmore got the head shot and Mr. Nix got the\r\nhead shot.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They both got it.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. We have both those films.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We might take a look at it while we are here. I don't think\r\nI have ever seen those. Those are 88 mm., too.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Film.)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This film is the film that was taken by Mr. Orville\r\nNix of the assassination. This is along Houston street going toward\r\nElm. There was the head shot. We will roll it back and run it at slow\r\nmotion. The head shot shows just a very faint pink.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Very soon after this sequence begins. Just as the President\r\nis directly under the white abutment in the background. I will try to\r\ngive you a clue about when it is going to happen, there.\r\n\r\nThe next film is the film that was exposed in Mr. Nix's camera standing\r\nin the position determined to be his camera position at the reenactment\r\nin Dallas, with the car traveling at approximately 11 miles an hour\r\nalong Elm street.\r\n\r\nThese films were compared with each other and found to be consistent\r\nin the size of the car in the area of the picture and verified the\r\nposition as being that of Mr. Nix.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now shown us, Mr. Shaneyfelt, all of the movies\r\nthat we saw, we took in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mrs. Muchmore.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Muchmore.\r\n\r\n(Film)\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. This is the motorcade coming down Main and turning into\r\nHouston street.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. She didn't know she took that.\r\n\r\nMr. SHANEYFELT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have we now seen all the films from Dallas? That concludes\r\nthe films.\r\n\r\nMr. McCloy, for the record, I would like to have the films marked with\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 904 identifying the Zapruder copy. That is the\r\ncopy of the original Zapruder film.\r\n\r\nMay I say here, parenthetically, that we do not intend to reproduce\r\nall of this in the published record of the Commission since we have\r\nextracted the key numbers on Exhibit 885 on the album which shows the\r\nframes of the Zapruder film after the President's automobile turns left\r\noff of Houston onto Elm, but for the permanent archives these films\r\nshould be made a part of the permanent record.\r\n\r\nI would like to have a copy of the original Nix film marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 905. I would like to have the copy of the\r\noriginal Muchmore film marked as Commission Exhibit No. 906. I would\r\nlike to have all of the movies which we took at Dallas marked in a\r\ngroup as Commission Exhibit No. 907.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is all the movies that were taken on May 24 in Dallas\r\nby the test team, so to speak.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Right, Commissioner McCloy. They are marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 907, and I would like to move formally for the admission\r\ninto evidence of Commission Exhibits Nos. 904 through 907 at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 904, 905, 906, and 907 were marked for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 7:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friday, June 5, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. JOHN F. KENNEDY\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met, at 4:20 p.m., on Friday, June 5, 1964,\r\nat 3017 N Street NW., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent was Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; and Robert F.\r\nKennedy, Attorney General of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kennedy, the Commission would just like to have you say in\r\nyour own words, in your own way, what happened at the time of\r\nthe assassination of the President. Mr. Rankin will ask you a few\r\nquestions, just from the time you left the airport until the time you\r\nstarted for the hospital. And we want it to be brief. We want it to\r\nbe in your own words and want you to say anything that you feel is\r\nappropriate to that occasion.\r\n\r\nWould you be sworn, please, Mrs. Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. State your name for the record.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Jacqueline Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are the widow of the former President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You live here in Washington?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you go back to the time that you came to Love Field on\r\nNovember 22 and describe what happened there after you landed in the\r\nplane?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. We got off the plane. The then Vice President and\r\nMrs. Johnson were there. They gave us flowers. And then the car was\r\nwaiting, but there was a big crowd there, all yelling, with banners and\r\neverything. And we went to shake hands with them. It was a very hot\r\nday. And you went all along a long line. I tried to stay close to my\r\nhusband and lots of times you get pushed away, you know, people leaning\r\nover and pulling your hand. They were very friendly.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, I don't know how we got back to the car. I think\r\nCongressman Thomas somehow was helping me. There was lots of confusion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then you did get into the car. And you sat on the left side\r\nof the car, did you, and your husband on your right?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And was Mrs. Connally----\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. In front of me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And Governor Connally to your right in the jump seat?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And Mrs. Connally was in the jump seat?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And then did you start off on the parade route?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And were there many people along the route that you waved\r\nto?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes. It was rather scattered going in.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a crowd of people with a sign saying something like\r\n\"President Kennedy, please get out and shake our hands, our neighbors\r\nsaid you wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. And he stopped and got out. That was, you know, like a\r\nlittle suburb and there were not many crowds. But then the crowds got\r\nbigger as you went in.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. As you got into the main street of Dallas were there very\r\nlarge crowds on all the streets?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you waved to them and proceeded down the street with\r\nthe motorcade?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes. And in the motorcade, you know, I usually would be\r\nwaving mostly to the left side and he was waving mostly to the right,\r\nwhich is one reason you are not looking at each other very much. And it\r\nwas terribly hot. Just blinding all of us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, do you remember as you turned off of the main street\r\nonto Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. I don't know the name of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is that one block before you get to the Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Well, I remember whenever it was, Mrs. Connally said, \"We\r\nwill soon be there.\" We could see a tunnel in front of us. Everything\r\nwas really slow then. And I remember thinking it would be so cool under\r\nthat tunnel.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And then do you remember as you turned off of Houston onto\r\nElm right by the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Well, I don't know the names of the streets, but I\r\nsuppose right by the Depository is what you are talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; that is the street that sort of curves as you go down\r\nunder the underpass.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes; well, that is when she said to President Kennedy,\r\n\"You certainly can't say that the people of Dallas haven't given you a\r\nnice welcome.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. I think he said--I don't know if I remember it or I have\r\nread it, \"No, you certainly can't,\" or something. And you know then the\r\ncar was very slow and there weren't very many people around.\r\n\r\nAnd then--do you want me to tell you what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; if you would, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. You know, there is always noise in a motorcade and there\r\nare always motorcycles besides us, a lot of them backfiring. So I was\r\nlooking to the left. I guess there was a noise, but it didn't seem like\r\nany different noise really because there is so much noise, motorcycles\r\nand things. But then suddenly Governor Connally was yelling, \"Oh, no,\r\nno, no.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he turn toward you?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. No; I was looking this way, to the left, and I heard\r\nthese terrible noises. You know. And my husband never made any sound.\r\nSo I turned to the right. And all I remember is seeing my husband, he\r\nhad this sort of quizzical look on his face, and his hand was up, it\r\nmust have been his left hand. And just as I turned and looked at him, I\r\ncould see a piece of his skull and I remember it was flesh colored. I\r\nremember thinking he just looked as if he had a slight headache. And I\r\njust remember seeing that. No blood or anything.\r\n\r\nAnd then he sort of did this [indicating], put his hand to his forehead\r\nand fell in my lap.\r\n\r\nAnd then I just remember falling on him and saying, \"Oh, no, no, no,\" I\r\nmean, \"Oh, my God, they have shot my husband.\" And \"I love you, Jack,\"\r\nI remember I was shouting. And just being down in the car with his head\r\nin my lap. And it just seemed an eternity.\r\n\r\nYou know, then, there were pictures later on of me climbing out the\r\nback. But I don't remember that at all.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember Mr. Hill coming to try to help on the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. I don't remember anything. I was just down like that.\r\n\r\nAnd finally I remember a voice behind me, or something, and then I\r\nremember the people in the front seat, or somebody, finally knew\r\nsomething was wrong, and a voice yelling, which must have been Mr.\r\nHill, \"Get to the hospital,\" or maybe it was Mr. Kellerman, in the\r\nfront seat. But someone yelling. I was just down and holding him.\r\n[Reference to wounds deleted.]\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any recollection of whether there were one or\r\nmore shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Well, there must have been two because the one that made\r\nme turn around was Governor Connally yelling. And it used to confuse\r\nme because first I remembered there were three and I used to think my\r\nhusband didn't make any sound when he was shot. And Governor Connally\r\nscreamed. And then I read the other day that it was the same shot\r\nthat hit them both. But I used to think if I only had been looking to\r\nthe right I would have seen the first shot hit him, then I could have\r\npulled him down, and then the second shot would not have hit him. But I\r\nheard Governor Connally yelling and that made me turn around, and as I\r\nturned to the right my husband was doing this [indicating with hand at\r\nneck]. He was receiving a bullet. And those are the only two I remember.\r\n\r\nAnd I read there was a third shot. But I don't know.\r\n\r\nJust those two.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any recollection generally of the speed that\r\nyou were going, not any precise amount.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. We were really slowing turning the corner. And there were\r\nvery few people.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did you stop at any time after the shots, or proceed\r\nabout the same way?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. I don't know, because--I don't think we stopped. But\r\nthere was such confusion. And I was down in the car and everyone was\r\nyelling to get to the hospital and you could hear them on the radio,\r\nand then suddenly I remember a sensation of enormous speed, which must\r\nhave been when we took off.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And then from there you proceeded as rapidly as possible to\r\nthe hospital, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall anyone saying anything else during the time\r\nof the shooting?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. So; there weren't any words. There was just Governor\r\nConnally's. And then I suppose Mrs. Connally was sort of crying and\r\ncovering her husband. But I don't remember any words.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a big windshield between--you know--I think. Isn't there?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Between the seats.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. So you know, those poor men in the front, you couldn't\r\nhear them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you think of anything more?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No; I think not. I think that is the story and that is\r\nwhat we came for.\r\n\r\nWe thank you very much, Mrs. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would just like to ask if you recall Special Agent\r\nKellerman saying anything to you as you came down the street after you\r\nturned that corner that you referred to.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. You mean before the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Well, I don't, because--you know, it is very hard for\r\nthem to talk. But I do not remember, just as I don't recall climbing\r\nout on the back of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes. You have told us what you remember about the entire\r\nperiod as far as you can recall, have you?\r\n\r\nMrs. KENNEDY. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mrs. Kennedy. (Whereupon, at 4:30\r\np.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, June 7, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. JACK RUBY\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 11:45 a.m., on June 7, 1964, in the\r\ninterrogation room of the Dallas County Jail, Main and Houston Streets,\r\nDallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; and Representative\r\nGerald R. Ford, member.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Joseph A. Ball,\r\nassistant counsel; Arlen Specter, assistant counsel; Leon Jaworski and\r\nRobert G. Storey, special counsel to the attorney general of Texas; Jim\r\nBowie, assistant district attorney; Joe H. Tonahill, attorney for Jack\r\nRuby; Elmer W. Moore, special agent, U.S. Secret Service; and J. E.\r\nDecker, sheriff of Dallas County.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Without a lie detector test on my testimony, my verbal\r\nstatements to you, how do you know if I am tell the truth?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Don't worry about that, Jack.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Just a minute, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You wanted to ask something, did you, Mr. Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I would like to be able to get a lie detector test or truth\r\nserum of what motivated me to do what I did at that particular time,\r\nand it seems as you get further into something, even though you know\r\nwhat you did, it operates against you somehow, brainwashes you, that\r\nyou are weak in what you want to tell the truth about and what you want\r\nto say which is the truth.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Warren, I don't know if you got any confidence in the lie\r\ndetector test and the truth serum, and so on.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I can't tell you just how much confidence I have\r\nin it, because it depends so much on who is taking it, and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut I will say this to you, that if you and your counsel want any kind\r\nof test, I will arrange it for you. I would be glad to do that, if you\r\nwant it.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't suggest a lie detector test to testify the truth, We will\r\ntreat you just the same as we do any other witness, but if you want\r\nsuch a test, I will arrange for it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I do want it. Will you agree to that, Joe?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. I sure do, Jack.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Any kind of a test you want to verify what you\r\nsay, we will be glad to do.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I want it even if you put me into a sort of drowsiness so you\r\ncan question me as to anything pertaining to my involvement in this\r\nparticular act.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Jack, you have wanted to do that from the very beginning,\r\nhaven't you?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; and the reason why I am asking for that is--are you\r\nlimited for time?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; we have all the time you want.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. As it started to trial--I don't know if you realize\r\nmy reasoning, how I happened to be involved--I was carried away\r\ntremendously emotionally, and all the time I tried to ask Mr. Belli, I\r\nwanted to get up and say the truth regarding the steps that led me to\r\ndo what I have got involved in, but since I have a spotty background\r\nin the night club business, I should have been the last person to ever\r\nwant to do something that I had been involved in.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I was carried away tremendously.\r\n\r\nYou want to ask me questions?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You tell us what you want, and then we will ask\r\nyou some questions.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think he ought to be sworn.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Am I boring you?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Go ahead. All right, Mr. Ruby, tell us your story.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That particular morning--where is Mr. Moore--I had to go down\r\nto the News Building, getting back to this--I don't want to interrupt.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. What morning do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Friday morning, the starting of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nMr. Belli evidently did not go into my case thoroughly,\r\ncircumstantially. If he had gone into it, he wouldn't have tried to\r\nvindicate me on an insanity plea to relieve me of all responsibility,\r\nbecause circumstantially everything looks so bad for me.\r\n\r\nIt can happen--it happens to many people who happen to be at the wrong\r\nplace at the right time.\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Belli spent more time with me, he would have realized not\r\nto try to get me out completely free; at the time we are talking,\r\ntechnically, how attorneys operate.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I understand.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Different things came up, flashed back into my mind, that\r\nit dirtied my background, that Mr. Belli and I tell the truth what I\r\nwent to say that I wanted to get on the stand and tell the truth what\r\nhappened that morning, he said, \"Jack, when they get you on the stand,\r\nyou are actually speaking of a premeditated crime that you involved\r\nyourself in.\"\r\n\r\nBut I didn't care, because I wanted to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"When the prosecution gets you on the stand, they will cut you\r\nto ribbons.\"\r\n\r\nSo naturally, I had to retract, and he fought his way to try to\r\nvindicate me out of this particular crime.\r\n\r\nYou follow that?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I do indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I want you to question me and requestion me on anything you\r\nwant, plus the fact I do want the tests when they are available.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. On Friday, the morning parade--this goes back to Thursday\r\nnight, because it has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nWe were having dinner at the Egyptian Restaurant----\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Right now, Mr. Ruby, before we get started taking\r\nyour testimony, would you mind being sworn?\r\n\r\n(Chief Justice Warren and Jack Ruby stand and both raise their right\r\nhand.)\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are\r\nabout to give before the Commission will be the truth, the whole truth,\r\nand nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I do.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Now will you please state whether the things you\r\nhave just told us are true under your oath?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I do so state they are the truth.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Now you complete whatever story you want to tell.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right. Thursday night I was having dinner at the Egyptian\r\nRestaurant on Mockingbird Lane, and a fellow comes over to the table. I\r\nwas sitting with a guy by the name of Ralph Paul. He tried to invite me\r\nto the club a couple of doors down and I refused, because he had taken\r\na band away from me that had been engaged for 7 years, and I felt it\r\nwas a lost cause, that the club would be failing because of that, and I\r\nsort of excused myself and I refused to go over to the club.\r\n\r\nWe finished our dinner, and I went down to the club that I operated,\r\nthe Carousel, and this particular master of ceremonies happened to be\r\nthere at the time, and we discussed a few things.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a columnist by the name of Tony Zoppi--and prior to that,\r\nI wrote out a full page copy of this build--I have the copies--as an\r\nemcee, and I brought a picture and brochure, and Tony said, \"I will\r\nwrite a story.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done 2 days prior to this Thursday night.\r\n\r\nSo then I went down, so we discussed it and were very much disgusted\r\nwith Tony because he only gave us a build of one or two lines.\r\n\r\nWell, I retired that night after closing the club. Then I knew I wanted\r\nto go back to the Morning News Building to get the brochure I left,\r\nand also this complete page of longhand writing describing the various\r\ntalents of this Bill DeMar.\r\n\r\nI picked up the brochure that Friday morning, and I also had business\r\nat the News Building on Friday because that is the start of the\r\nweekend, which is very lucrative, the weekend.\r\n\r\nI have ways of making my ads of where they have a way of selling the\r\nproduct I am producing or putting on on the show.\r\n\r\nSo I went down there Friday morning to Tony Zoppi's office, and they\r\nsaid he went to New Orleans for a couple of days.\r\n\r\nI picked up the brochure. I believe I got downtown there at 10:30 or 11\r\no'clock that morning. And I took the brochure and then went into the\r\nmain room where we compose our ads. That is the sales room where we\r\nplaced our ads.\r\n\r\nAnd I remained there for a while. I started to write the copy of my ad.\r\n\r\nNow I go back to the same fellow that wanted me to come over to the\r\nclub when we were having our dinner on Mockingbird at the Egyptian\r\nLounge.\r\n\r\nI came to the desk and I wanted to apologize and explain why I didn't\r\naccept his invitation last night. I wanted to explain, and that took\r\nabout 20 or 25 minutes. All this is pertaining to everything prior to\r\nthe terrible tragedy that happened.\r\n\r\nI started to explain to him why I didn't want to go there, because this\r\nfellow mentioned--Tony, I think--I can't think of his last name--of me\r\nhaving his band so many years, and I felt at the moment I didn't want\r\nto go over to the club because I didn't care to meet this fellow.\r\n\r\nAnd he started to apologize, \"Jack, I am sorry, I did work for the\r\nfellow and we have been advertising him for that club, and I am\r\nputting out a night club book.\"\r\n\r\nI remained with him for 20 or 25 minutes talking there. I don't know\r\nwhether my ad was completed or not. It was an ad on the Vegas and the\r\nCarousel.\r\n\r\nMy ads were completed, I believe, and after finishing my conversation\r\nwith him, he left.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man that completes my ads for me, that helps me with it on\r\noccasion--but I usually make it up myself--but the person that takes\r\nthe money for the ads--this is the reason it is so hard for me to meet\r\na deadline when I get downtown to the News Building. And as a rule, I\r\nhave to pay cash for my ads.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in debt, it is necessary, and they will not put it in\r\nunless you pay cash.\r\n\r\nAnd consequently, the weekend, I had been to town on that particular\r\nday. All this adds up later on, as I will state why I didn't go to the\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I don't want to go where there is big crowds. I\r\ncan't explain it to you. If I was interested, I would have seen it on\r\ntelevision, our beloved President and all the parade that transpired.\r\n\r\nBut all that adds up why it is important for me to be in the News\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nI owe the Government quite a bit of money, and it is doing business out\r\nof your pocket, supposedly, in the slang expression.\r\n\r\nWell, John Newnam comes in, and evidently he took it for granted I\r\nfinished my ad, and I don't recall if he paid for his ad, and suddenly\r\nthere is some milling around. I think it was 12, or 15 minutes after\r\n12, I don't recall what, but John Newnam said someone had been shot.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sorry, I got carried away. It is the first time I got carried\r\naway, because I had been under pressure.\r\n\r\nAnd someone else came running over and he said a Secret Service man was\r\nshot, or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nAnd I am here in the middle with John Newnam, because Newnam isn't\r\npaying any attention to anyone else, and there is a lot of going back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\nSo someone must have made a statement that Governor Connally was shot.\r\nI don't recall what was said. And I was in a state of hysteria, I mean.\r\n\r\nYou say, \"Oh my God, it can't happen.\" You carry on crazy sayings.\r\n\r\nThere was a little television set in one office not far away from\r\nwhere I had been sitting at the desk. I ran over there and noticed a\r\nlittle boy and a little sister say, \"I was standing right there when it\r\nhappened.\" I mean, different things you hear on the television.\r\n\r\nThen the phone started ringing off the desk and I heard John Newnam say\r\npeople were complaining about the ad, why they accepted this ad.\r\n\r\n(A tray of water and glasses was brought in.)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nHas every witness been this hesitant in trying to explain their story?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You are doing very well. I can understand why you\r\nhave to reflect upon a story of that length.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The phones were ringing off the desk calling various ads, and\r\nthey were having a turmoil in that News Building because of a person by\r\nthe name of Bernard Weissman placing that particular ad, a full page\r\nad. I am sure you are familiar with the ad.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Criticizing a lot of things about our beloved President. Then\r\nJohn Newnam and I and another gentleman walked over to another part of\r\nthe room, and I heard John Newnam say, \"I told him not to take that\r\nad.\" Something to that effect.\r\n\r\nThen he said, \"Well, you have seen him pay part cash and come back and\r\npay the balance.\"\r\n\r\nNow everything is very vague to me as to when this transpired; after\r\nthey heard the President had been shot, or prior to that.\r\n\r\nYou know it's been a long time, and I am under a very bad mental strain\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. From the time that we were told that the President was shot,\r\n35 minutes later they said he had passed away. In the meantime, I\r\nbecame very emotional. I called my sister at home. She was carried\r\naway terribly bad. And John Newnam happened to be there, and I know it\r\nis a funny reaction you have, you want other people to feel that you\r\nfeel emotionally disturbed the same way as other people, so I let John\r\nlisten to the phone that my sister was crying hysterically.\r\n\r\nAnd I said to John, I said, \"John, I will have to leave Dallas.\" I\r\ndon't know why I said that, but it is a funny reaction that you feel;\r\nthe city is terribly let down by the tragedy that happened. And I said,\r\n\"John, I am not opening up tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I don't know what else transpired there. I know people were just\r\nheartbroken.\r\n\r\nI left the room. I may have left out a few things. Mr. Moore remembers\r\nprobably more, but you come back and question me and maybe I can answer\r\nthose questions.\r\n\r\nI left the building and I went down and I got my car, and I couldn't\r\nstop crying, because naturally when I pulled up to a stoplight and\r\nother people would be adjacent to me, I wouldn't want them to see me\r\ncrying, because it looked kind of artificial.\r\n\r\nAnd I went to the club and I came up, and I may have made a couple of\r\ncalls from there. I could have called my colored boy, Andy, down at the\r\nclub. I could have--I don't know who else I would have called, but I\r\ncould have, because it is so long now since my mind is very much warped\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nYou think that literally?\r\n\r\nI went up to the club, and I told Andy, I said, \"Call everyone and tell\r\nthem we are not opening.\"\r\n\r\nWe have a little girl in Fort Worth I wanted to make sure he called her.\r\n\r\nAnd a fellow by the name of Bell called and wanted to know if we were\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nAnd Kathy Kay called, and I said, \"Definitely not.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I called Ralph Paul, that owns the Bull Pen. He said, \"Jack,\r\nbeing as everyone else is open\"--because he knows I was pressed for\r\nmoney--and I said, \"No, Ralph, I can't open.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Okay, if that is why, that is the way it's got to be.\"\r\n\r\nSo in the meantime, I had gone with Alice Nichols for some time, and\r\nI called her on the phone but she wasn't there, but I left the number\r\non the pay phone for her to return the call, because I didn't want to\r\nkeep the business phone tied up. And I hadn't spoken to her in maybe 9\r\nmonths or a year. I don't know what I said to her, not many words, but\r\njust what happened.\r\n\r\nI still remained around the club there. I am sure I was crying pretty\r\nbad. I think I made a long-distance call to California. This fellow had\r\njust visited me, and I had known him in the days back in Chicago when\r\nwe were very young, in the real tough part of Chicago. His name is Al\r\nGruber.\r\n\r\nHe was a bad kid in those days, but he is quite reformed. He is married\r\nand has a family, and I am sure he makes a very legitimate livelihood\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nHe happened to come through a couple of nights prior to that to try\r\nto interest me, or 4 or 5 days prior to that, to interest me in a new\r\nkind--you follow the story as I tell it?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. It is important, very important. It is on a new kind of\r\nmachine that washes cars. You pay with tokens. It is a new thing. I\r\ndon't know if it faded out or not. He tried to interest my brother,\r\nSammy, because Sammy sold his washateria.\r\n\r\nAnd my sister was in the hospital when he first came. I am going back\r\na little bit. Sammy didn't go to the hospital, and we needed to tell\r\nSammy about this particular thing, and that is the reason Al Gruber\r\ncame into the picture, because he came to try to interest my brother,\r\nSammy, in this new washateria deal to wash cars.\r\n\r\nHe left and went to California, but before he went to California I\r\npromised him my dachshund dog.\r\n\r\nWhen this thing happened, I called him. He said, \"Yes, we are just\r\nwatching on television.\" And I couldn't carry on more conversation. I\r\nsaid, \"Al, I have to hang up.\"\r\n\r\nThen I must have called my sister, Eileen, in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThen a fellow came over to deliver some merchandise I had ordered over\r\nthe phone, or Andy ordered. And we said, \"What is the use of purchasing\r\nany merchandise of any kind, we are not interested in business.\" And I\r\ndon't recall what I said, but I told him whatever money he received, to\r\nkeep the change. I am not a philanthropist, but nothing bothered me at\r\nthe time. I wasn't interested in anything.\r\n\r\nThen I kept calling my sister, Eva, because she wanted me to come be\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nEva and I have a very complex personality. Very rarely can I be with\r\nher, but on this particular occasion, since she was carrying on so, I\r\nfelt that I wanted to be with someone that meant something to me. I\r\nwanted to be with her.\r\n\r\nAnd I kept calling her back, \"I will be there.\" And so on. But I never\r\ndid get there until a couple of hours later.\r\n\r\nI finally left the club. I am sure you gentlemen can brief in all the\r\nthings that happened before. A kid by the name of Larry up there, I\r\nthink I told him to send the dog they crated, to find out about the\r\nprice--very implusive about everything.\r\n\r\nThen I left the club. And I had been dieting, but I felt I wanted some\r\nfood. I can't explain it. It would be like getting intoxicated at that\r\nparticular time. It is amusing, but it is true.\r\n\r\nI went over to the Ritz Delicatessen a block and a half away. Must have\r\nbought out the store, for about $10 worth of delicacies and so on. Went\r\nout to my sister's and stayed at her apartment.\r\n\r\nOh, I called from the apartment--my sister knew more of my calls than I\r\ndid. I remember I think I called--I can't think of who I called.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am sure I made some calls of what had happened there.\r\nSomebody will have to piece me together from the time I got to my\r\nsister's apartment where I had partaken of the food.\r\n\r\nOh yes, I called Andy. This Andy Armstrong called me and said, \"Don\r\nSafran wants you to call him.\"\r\n\r\nThis is rare for this gentleman, because he is a columnist for the\r\nDallas Times Herald, because he never could get out any copy for my\r\nclub. And he said, \"Don Safran wants me to call him.\"\r\n\r\nI called him, and he said, \"Jack, are you going to be closed tonight?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Well, the Cabana and the Adolphus, the Century Room, are\r\ngoing to be closed.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Don, I am not asking you about any clubs that are going to be\r\nclosed. I know I am going to be closed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Jack, that is what I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"You don't have to prompt me about who else is going to be\r\nclosed.\"\r\n\r\nI put the receiver down and talked to my sister, and I said, \"Eva, what\r\nshall we do?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she said, \"Jack, let's close for the 3 days.\" She said, \"We don't\r\nhave anything anyway, but we owe it to\"--(chokes up).\r\n\r\nSo I called Don Safran back immediately and I said, \"Don, we decided to\r\nclose for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Okay.\"\r\n\r\nThen I called the Morning News and I wanted to definitely make sure\r\nto change a copy of my ad to \"Closed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,\"\r\nsomething to that effect.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a little late in the afternoon, but he said, \"we will try to\r\nget the copy in.\"\r\n\r\nThen I called Don back again but couldn't get him, and I spoke to one\r\nof his assistants, and I said, I forget what I told him. Anyway, that\r\nis one of the calls I had that had transpired.\r\n\r\nI lie down and take a nap. I wake about 7 or 7:30. In the meantime, I\r\nthink I called--the reason this comes back to me, I know I was going to\r\ngo to the synagogue.\r\n\r\nI called Coleman Jacobson and asked him what time services are tonight,\r\nand he said he didn't know.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Are there going to be any special services?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said he didn't know of any.\r\n\r\nAnd I called the Congregation Shearith Israel and asked the girl, and\r\nshe said, \"Regular services at 8 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Aren't there going to be earlier services like 5:30 or 6?\r\n\r\nAnd about 7:30 I went to my apartment. I don't know if I went downtown\r\nto the club. I know I went to my apartment--either to the club or to\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nAnd I changed, showered and shaved, and I think I drove--and as I drove\r\ndown, there is a certain Thornton Freeway, and I saw the clubs were\r\nstill open going full blast, a couple of clubs there.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I went out to the synagogue and I went through the line and\r\nI spoke to Rabbi Silverman, and I thanked him for going to visit my\r\nsister at the hospital. She was in a week prior and had just gotten\r\nout. I don't remember the date.\r\n\r\nThen he had a confirmation--this is the night prior to the\r\nconfirmation. They serve little delicacies. So in spite of the fact\r\nof the mood I was in, I strolled into the place, and I think I had a\r\nlittle glass of punch. Nothing intoxicating, just a little punch they\r\nserve there. I didn't speak to anyone. One girl, Leona, said \"Hello,\r\nJack,\" and I wasn't in a conversational mood whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI left the club--I left the synagogue and I drove by the Bali-Hai\r\nRestaurant. I noticed they were open. I took recognition of that.\r\n\r\nI drove by another club called the Gay Nineties, and they were closed.\r\n\r\nAnd I made it my business to drive down Preston Road. In my mind\r\nsuddenly it mulled over me that the police department was working\r\novertime. And this is the craziest thing that ever happened in a\r\nperson's life. I have always been very close to the police department,\r\nI don't know why.\r\n\r\nI felt I have always abided by the law--a few little infractions, but\r\nnot serious--and I felt we have one of the greatest police forces in\r\nthe world here, and I have always been close to them, and I visited in\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nAnd over the radio I heard they were working overtime.\r\n\r\nI stopped at the delicatessen called Phil's on Oak Lawn Avenue, and\r\nsuddenly I decided--I told the clerk there I wanted him to make me some\r\nreal good sandwiches, about 10 or 12, and he had already started on the\r\nsandwiches and I got on the phone.\r\n\r\nI called an officer by the name of Sims and I said, \"Sims, I hear you\r\nguys are working,\" and so on. I said, \"I want to bring some sandwiches.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Jack, we wound up our work already. We wound up what we\r\nwere doing. We are finished what we were doing. I will tell the boys\r\nabout your thoughtfulness, and I will thank them for you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there is a fellow in town that has been very good to\r\nme named Gordon McLendon. Do you know him, Mr. Warren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I think I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He had been giving me a lot of free plugs. And all the while\r\nlistening to the radio, I heard about a certain diskjockey, Joe Long,\r\nthat is down at the station, giving firsthand information--I want to\r\ndescribe him--of Oswald.\r\n\r\nVery rarely do I use the name Oswald. I don't know why. I don't know\r\nhow to explain it--of the person that committed the act. [Pause to\r\ncompose self.]\r\n\r\nSo before going down to the police station, I try to call KLIF but\r\ncan't get their number.\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring the sandwiches to KLIF so they would have the\r\nsandwiches, since they already started to make them up.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember Russ Knight, a diskjockey--these names aren't familiar\r\nto you, but I have to mention them in order to refresh my memory.\r\n\r\nHis name was Moore, or something, and I tried to get information on the\r\ntelephone, but they couldn't give me the phone number of his home.\r\n\r\nI probably thought I could get the phone number, but after 6 p.m., you\r\ncannot get into the premises unless you have a \"hot\" number that is\r\nright to the diskjockey room.\r\n\r\nSo I couldn't get a hold of that.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, I called Gordon McLendon's home, because I know\r\nhe lives near the synagogue out there, and I got a little girl on the\r\nphone, and I knew they had children, and I asked for the number for\r\nKLIF.\r\n\r\nI said, \"Anyone home?\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Is your daddy or mommy home?\" I forget what transpired. I\r\nsaid, \"I would like to get the number of the station so I can get in\r\nthe building at this time.\"\r\n\r\nShe said she would go and see, and gave me a Riverside exchange.\r\n\r\nMind you, this is 6 or 7 months back, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAnd I asked her name. Her name was Christine, I think. I said, \"I\r\nwanted to bring some sandwiches.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"My mother already brought sandwiches.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I wanted to go there too.\" And that was the end of this\r\nlittle girl's conversation with myself.\r\n\r\nI called that number, as I am repeating myself. There was no such\r\nnumber. It was an obsolete number.\r\n\r\nI go down to the--I drive by--I leave the delicatessen--the clerk\r\nhelped me with the sandwiches out to my car, and I thanked him. I told\r\nhim, \"These were going to KLIF, and I want you to make them real good.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped me with the sandwiches in the car. I got in the car and drove\r\ndown toward town. I imagine it is about 4 or 5 miles to the downtown\r\nsection from this delicatessen.\r\n\r\nBut prior to going into the station, I drove up McKinney Avenue to look\r\nover a couple of clubs to see if they were activating. I knew the club\r\nacross from the Phil's Delicatessen and I knew the B. & B. Restaurant\r\nwas open. That is a restaurant and I know the necessity for food, but I\r\ncan't understand some of the clubs remaining open. It struck me funny\r\nat such a tragic time as that happening.\r\n\r\nI drove down to Commerce and Harwood and parked my car with my\r\ndog--incidentally, I always have my dog with me--on the lot there,\r\nleft the sandwiches in the car, went into the building of the police\r\nstation, took the elevator up to the second floor, and there was a\r\npolice officer there.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I ever entered the building, gentlemen. The\r\nfirst time of that Friday. This time it must have been about--I\r\nmean the time, the time of my entering the building, I guess, was\r\napproximately 11:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe officer was there, and I said, \"Where is Joe Long?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Can I go and look for him?\"\r\n\r\nEvidently I took a little domineering part about me, and I was able\r\nto be admitted. I asked different reporters and various personalities\r\nthere, \"Are you Joe Long?,\" and I couldn't locate him.\r\n\r\nI even had a police officer try to page him and he couldn't locate him.\r\n\r\nI recognized a couple of police officers, Cal Jones and a few others,\r\nand I said \"hello\" to them.\r\n\r\nAnd I am still looking for Joe Long, but I am carried away with the\r\nexcitement of history.\r\n\r\nAnd one fellow then--I am in the hallway there--there is a narrow\r\nhallway, and I don't recall if Captain Fritz or Chief Curry brings the\r\nprisoner out, and I am standing about 2 or 3 feet away from him, and\r\nthere is some reporters that didn't know the various police officers,\r\nand I don't know whether they asked me or I volunteered to tell them,\r\nbecause I knew they were looking to find out who that was, and I said,\r\n\"That was Chief Curry\" or \"That is Captain Fritz,\" or whoever it was.\r\n\r\nI don't recall Henry Wade coming out in the hallway. He probably did. I\r\ndon't recall what happened.\r\n\r\n(To Joe Tonahill) Is that for me, Joe?\r\n\r\nThen suddenly someone asked, either the Chief or Captain Fritz, \"Isn't\r\nthere a larger room we can go into?\"\r\n\r\nThey said, \"Well, let's go down to the assembly room downstairs.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what transpired in between from the time that I had the\r\nofficer page Joe Long up to the time I was standing about 3 feet\r\naway from Oswald. All the things--I don't recall if I am telling you\r\neverything that happened from that time, from the time I entered the\r\nbuilding to the time I went down to the assembly room.\r\n\r\nI went down to the assembly room down in the basement. I felt perfectly\r\nfree walking in there. No one asked me or anything. I got up on a\r\nlittle table there where I knew I wasn't blocking anyone's view,\r\nbecause there was an abutment sticking out, and I had my back to the\r\nabutment, and I was standing there.\r\n\r\nThen they brought the prisoner out and various questions were being\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\nI noticed there was a chief county judge--Davidson, I can't think of\r\nhis name, one of these precinct court judges, and they brought the\r\nprisoner out.\r\n\r\nI don't recall if Chief Fritz, Captain Fritz was there, or Chief Curry.\r\nI know Henry Wade was there. And they started shouting questions and he\r\nsaid, \"Is he the one?\" And the question about the gun.\r\n\r\nAnd they questioned Henry Wade, \"what organization did he belong to,\"\r\nor something. And if I recall, I think Henry Wade answered, \"Free Cuba.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I corrected Henry Wade, because listening to the radio or KLIF,\r\nit stood out in my mind that it was \"Fair Play Cuba.\" There was a\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nSo he said, \"Oh yes, Fair Play Cuba,\" and he corrected that.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long we remained there. There was a lot of questions\r\nthrown back and forth, and this District Attorney Henry Wade was\r\nanswering them to the best he could.\r\n\r\nFrom the way he stated, he let the reporters know that this was the\r\nguilty one that committed the crime.\r\n\r\nHe specifically stated that in that room, that he was the one.\r\n\r\nIt didn't have any effect in my mind, because whether the person had\r\ncome out, whether he come out openly and publicly stated didn't have\r\nany bearing in my mind, because I wasn't interested in anything. All I\r\nknew, they had the prisoner. But the reporters like to know where they\r\nstand, \"is he the one?\"\r\n\r\nWe left out in the hallway, and I saw Henry Wade standing there, and\r\nI went over to him and said, \"Henry. I want you to know I was the one\r\nthat corrected you.\" I think it is a childish thing, but I met Henry\r\nWade sometime back, and I knew he would recognize me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it was \"Fair Play Cuba,\" or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as I leave Henry Wade, two gentlemen pass by and I\r\nsaid, \"Are you Joe Long?\" He said, \"No, why do you want Joe Long?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I got to get into KLIF. I have got some sandwiches.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"What about us?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Some other time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it so happened I found out Jerry Cunkle and Sam Pease, I found out\r\nthey were the names, so I did get the number, because these fellows\r\nwork for a rival radio station, and he gave me the number of KLIF.\r\n\r\nAnd in the testimony of John Rutledge, if I recall now--this is the\r\nonly time I had ever seen this person. When I went out the railing\r\nwhere the phone was at, people felt free to walk in.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I felt that I was deputized as a reporter momentarily,\r\nyou might say.\r\n\r\nSo I called one of the boys at KLIF and I said to them, \"I have\r\nsandwiches for you. I want to get over there.\" I said, \"By the way, I\r\nsee Henry Wade talking on the phone to someone. Do you want me to get\r\nhim over here?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Yes, do that.\"\r\n\r\nThat is when everyone was beckoning Henry Wade, and I called him over\r\nand he talked on the phone to this boy.\r\n\r\nAnd after he finished; I didn't even tell him what station it was.\r\nI said, \"Here is somebody that wants to talk to you.\" And I felt he\r\nwouldn't turn it down.\r\n\r\nAnd this fellow was very much elated that I brought him over there.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Now, will you let me in?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I will only leave the door open for 5 minutes.\" That was\r\nafter the conversation was finished with Henry Wade.\r\n\r\nI got ready to leave the building and I got up to the next floor and\r\nthere was another diskjockey at KLIF, Russ Knight. He said, \"Jack,\r\nwhere is everything happening?\" And he had a tape recorder.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Come on downstairs\", and led him downstairs. And there was\r\nHenry Wade sitting there. And I said, \"Henry, this is Russ Knight.\" And\r\nI left him there with Henry Wade, and I went to my car and drove over\r\nto KLIF, which is a block away from there.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a little chilly that night, as I recall, but by bringing\r\nRuss Knight over to Henry Wade, I delayed too long to get to KLIF, and\r\nI had to wait 15 minutes until Russ Knight came from finishing his\r\ninterview with Henry Wade.\r\n\r\nI had the sandwiches with me and some soda pop and various things, and\r\nRuss Knight opened the door and we went upstairs.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Arlen Specter, a staff counsel, entered the room.)\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. This is another man on my staff, Mr. Specter.\r\nWould you mind if he came in?\r\n\r\n(Chief Justice Warren introduced the men around the room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Is there any way to get me to Washington?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Is there any way of you getting me to Washington?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I don't know of any. I will be glad to talk to\r\nyour counsel about what the situation is, Mr. Ruby, when we get an\r\nopportunity to talk.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I don't think I will get a fair representation with my\r\ncounsel, Joe Tonahill. I don't think so. I would like to request that I\r\ngo to Washington and you take all the tests that I have to take. It is\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Jack, will you tell him why you don't think you will get\r\na fair representation?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Because I have been over this for the longest time to get the\r\nlie detector test. Somebody has been holding it back from me.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, I might say to you that the lateness of\r\nthis thing is not due to your counsel. He wrote me, I think, close to\r\n2 months ago and told me that you would be glad to testify and take, I\r\nbelieve he said, any test. I am not sure of that, but he said you would\r\nbe glad to testify before the Commission.\r\n\r\nAnd I thanked him for the letter. But we have been so busy that this is\r\nthe first time we have had an opportunity to do it.\r\n\r\nBut there has been no delay, as far as I know, on the part of Mr.\r\nTonahill in bringing about this meeting. It was our own delay due to\r\nthe pressures we had on us at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. What State are you from, Congressman?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Michigan. Grand Rapids, Mich.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I will be glad to talk that over, if we can. You\r\nmight go right ahead, if you wish, with the rest of your statement.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right. I remained at KLIF from that moment on, from the\r\ntime I got into the building, with Russ Knight. We talked about various\r\nthings. I brought out the thought of this ad that Bernard Weissman had\r\nplaced in the newspaper, and I also told Russ the one I admired by\r\nGordon McLendon.\r\n\r\nHe came out with an editorial about the incident with Adlai Stevenson\r\nand all those things. He is one person that will immediately go to bat\r\nif anything is wrong. He will clarify it.\r\n\r\nAnd I told Russ Knight there were some other things that were occurring\r\nat the time. So I remained there until about 2 a.m., and we all partook\r\nof the sandwiches and had a feast there.\r\n\r\nAnd they spliced the various comments they got back and forth of Henry\r\nWade, of Russ Knight's copy--of Russ Knight's items of Henry Wade.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, this is the young man, Mr. Specter. He\r\nis a member of our staff, and he comes from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n(Ruby shakes hands with Mr. Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I am at a disadvantage, gentlemen, telling my story.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You were right at the point where you had it\r\nabout 2 o'clock in the morning, and you had had your feast, as you\r\nmentioned, and had talked to these men, and so forth. That was the last\r\nthat you had told us.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, lots of things occurred up to that. They talked pro and\r\ncon about the tragedy.\r\n\r\nAt 2 a.m., I left the building. I drove--I was going to go toward the\r\nTimes Herald Building, because as a result--I very rarely go there for\r\nmy weekend ad, because once I get the ad into the Morning News, which\r\nis the earlier issue, all I have to do is call the newspaper and they\r\ntranspire the same ad that I had into the newspaper--into the Morning\r\nNews.\r\n\r\nAnd I promised one of the boys working in the Times Herald Building\r\nthere--I was in the act, in the business of a twist-board deal I was\r\npromoting as a sales item by advertisement and mail order, and I had\r\nbeen evading him, or didn't have time to go out there because it was\r\nvery late when I left the club, and I didn't want to stop, but because\r\nthis was an early morning, I thought this would be the right time to go\r\nover there, plus the fact of changing my ad I had in the Morning News\r\nto the closing of 3 days, that I would go over there and maybe add a\r\nlittle more effectiveness to it in the way I wanted the ad placed.\r\n\r\nAs I was driving toward the Times Herald with the intention of doing\r\nthese things, I heard someone honk a horn very loudly, and I stopped.\r\nThere was a police officer sitting in a car. He was sitting with this\r\nyoung lady that works in my club, Kathy Kay, and they were very much\r\ncarried away.\r\n\r\nAnd I was carried away; and he had a few beers, and it is so bad, about\r\nthose places open, and I was a great guy to close; and I remained with\r\nthem--did I tell you this part of it?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I don't recall this part; no.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I didn't tell you this part because at the time I thought a\r\nlot of Harry Carlson as a police officer, and either it slipped my mind\r\nin telling this, or it was more or less a reason for leaving it out,\r\nbecause I felt I didn't want to involve them in anything, because it\r\nwas supposed to be a secret that he was going with this young lady. He\r\nhad marital problems.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that is why I didn't tell you that. Anyway, I did leave\r\nit out. His name is Harry Carlson. Her name is Kathy Kay.\r\n\r\nAnd they talked and they carried on, and they thought I was the\r\ngreatest guy in the world, and he stated they should cut this guy inch\r\nby inch into ribbons, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd she said, \"Well, if he was in England, they would drag him through\r\nthe streets and would have hung him.\" I forget what she said.\r\n\r\nI left them after a long delay. They kept me from leaving. They were\r\nconstantly talking and were in a pretty dramatic mood. They were crying\r\nand carrying on.\r\n\r\nI went to the building of the Times Herald. I went to the Times\r\nHerald--may I read that, Joe? May I please?\r\n\r\n(Joe Tonahill hands paper to Jack Ruby.)\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Sam ever get your glasses?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Not yet. [Reading.] \"This is the girl that\"--what?--\"that\r\nstarted Jack off.\" What is this other word?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Culminated?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That is untrue. That is what I wanted to read. (Throwing pad\r\non table.)\r\n\r\nGentlemen, unless you get me to Washington, you can't get a fair shake\r\nout of me.\r\n\r\nIf you understand my way of talking, you have got to bring me to\r\nWashington to get the tests.\r\n\r\nDo I sound dramatic? Off the beam?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; you are speaking very, very rationally,\r\nand I am really surprised that you can remember as much as you have\r\nremembered up to the present time.\r\n\r\nYou have given it to us in detail.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Unless you can get me to Washington, and I am not a crackpot,\r\nI have all my senses--I don't want to evade any crime I am guilty of.\r\nBut Mr. Moore, have I spoken this way when we have talked?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Unless you get me to Washington immediately, I am afraid\r\nafter what Mr. Tonahill has written there, which is unfair to me\r\nregarding my testimony here--you all want to hear what he wrote?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; you might read it. If you need glasses\r\nagain, try mine this time (handing glasses to Mr. Ruby).\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY (putting on glasses). \"This is the girl\"----\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. \"Thing,\" isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. \"This is the thing that started Jack in the shooting.\"\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Kathy Kay was talking about Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You are lying, Joe Tonahill. You are lying.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. No; I am not.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You are lying, because you know what motivated me. You want\r\nto make it that it was a premeditation.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; you do.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. I don't think there was any premeditation, but you go\r\nahead and tell it your way. That is what we want you to do. That is\r\nwhat the Chief Justice wants.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Not when you specify this.\r\n\r\nYou are Senator Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No; I am the general counsel for our Commission, Mr. Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. You go on and keep telling it down to Caroline and the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, may I suggest this, that if we are to\r\nhave any tests, either a lie detector or, as you suggest, maybe a truth\r\nserum--I don't know anything about truth serum, but if we are to have\r\nit, we have to have something to check against, and we would like to\r\nhave the rest of your story as you started to tell us, because you are\r\nnow getting down to the crucial part of it, and it wouldn't be fair to\r\nyou to have this much of it and then not have the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Because the reason why, Joe knows from the time that I told\r\nAttorney Belli, and the story I wanted to tell on the stand, and Mr.\r\nTonahill knows this isn't the time. The thought never entered my mind.\r\nHe knows it.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. I didn't say the thought entered your mind. I didn't say\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You are inferring that.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Unconsciously, maybe, is what I meant to say.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Why go back to Friday, Joe?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. You are going to come right down----\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Why go back to Friday? That set me off.\r\n\r\nThen it is a greater premeditation than you know is true.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. I don't say it is premeditation. I never have. I don't\r\nthink it is.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Because it never entered my mind when they talked about, the\r\nofficer, cutting him into bits. You would like to have built it up for\r\nmy defense, but that is not it. I am here to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. The psychiatrist said that to me.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You want to put that into my thoughts, but it never happened.\r\nI took it with a grain of salt what he said at that particular time.\r\n\r\nWell, it is too bad, Chief Warren, that you didn't get me to your\r\nheadquarters 6 months ago.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, Mr. Ruby, I will tell you why we didn't.\r\nBecause you were then about to be tried and I didn't want to do\r\nanything that would prejudice you in your trial. And for that reason, I\r\nwouldn't even consider asking you to testify until your trial was over.\r\nThat is the only reason that we didn't talk to you sooner.\r\n\r\nAnd I wish we had gotten here a little sooner after your trial was\r\nover, but I know you had other things on your mind, and we had other\r\nwork, and it got to this late date.\r\n\r\nBut I assure you, there is no desire on our part to let this matter go\r\nto any late date for any ulterior purpose. I assure you of that.\r\n\r\nAnd as I told you at the beginning, if you want a test of some kind\r\nmade, I will undertake to see that it is done.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You have power to do it, even though the district attorney\r\nobjects to me getting the tests?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. How soon can it be done?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I am not familiar with those things, but we\r\nwill try to do it expeditiously, you may be sure, because we are trying\r\nto wind up the work of this Commission. And I assure you we won't delay\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Are you staying overnight here, Chief Warren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I have to be back, because we have an early\r\nsession of the Court tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Is there any way of getting a polygraph here?\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. May I make a suggestion?\r\n\r\nJack, listen, you and I have had a lot of dealings. Do you want my\r\nofficers removed from the room while you talk to this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That wouldn't prove any truth.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. These people came several thousand miles to interview you.\r\nYou have wanted to tell me your story and I have refused to let you\r\ntell me. Now be a man with a bunch of men that have come a long way to\r\ngive you an opportunity to.\r\n\r\nYou asked me for permission to tell your story, and I told you \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a supreme investigating committee at this particular time. Now\r\ngive them your story and be a man, if you want them to deal with you\r\nand deal fairly with you.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. It is unfair to me unless I get all the facilities to back up\r\nwhat I say.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. You tell him your story. Nobody is denying it. You tell\r\nthis man. He has come a thousand or more miles to listen to you. Now be\r\na man about it.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. What I suggest--Jack, at one time I was a polygraph\r\noperator, and you would not be able to go through the entire story the\r\nway you have here.\r\n\r\nSo, seriously, you should tell the story and the things you want\r\nchecked, you can be asked directly. Because you can only answer yes or\r\nno on the polygraph examination. So I think in view of what you want,\r\nyou should tell your story first, and then the points that you want\r\nverified, you can be questioned on.\r\n\r\nAs the sheriff mentioned, the Commission has come a long way to have\r\nthe opportunity to listen to your story, and I am sure that they know\r\nyou are telling the truth, in any case.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I wish the President were right here now. It is a terrible\r\nordeal, I tell you that.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I am sure it is an ordeal for you, and we want to\r\nmake it just as easy as we can. That is the reason that we have let you\r\ntell your story in your own way without being interrupted.\r\n\r\nIf you will just proceed with the rest of your statement, I think it\r\nwould make it a lot easier for us to verify it in the way that you want\r\nit to be done.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I don't know how to answer you.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, you have told us most of what happened up\r\nto the time of the incident, and you are almost within, you are just\r\nwithin a few hours of it now.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There is a Saturday.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There is a Saturday night. There is a Friday night. This is\r\nstill only Friday night, Chief.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; that is true.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, I will go into a certain point, and if I stop, you will\r\nhave to understand if I stop to get my bearings together.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I am in the Times Herald Building. I go upstairs, naturally.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. This is about what time?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. This, I imagine, is--I left the KLIF at 2 a.m., and I spent\r\nan hour with the officer and his girl friend, so it must have been\r\nabout 3:15 approximately. No; it wasn't. When you are not concerned\r\nwith time, it could have been 4 o'clock.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. It doesn't make any difference.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Forty-five minutes difference.\r\n\r\nI am up there in the composing room talking to a guy by the name of\r\nPat Gadash. He was so elated that I brought him this twist board, and\r\nI had it sealed in a polyethylene bag, but he wanted to see how it is\r\ndemonstrated, how it was worked.\r\n\r\nIt is a board that is on a pivot, a ball bearing, and it has a tendency\r\nto give you certain exercises in twisting your body. So not that I\r\nwanted to get in with the hilarity of frolicking, but he asked me to\r\nshow him, and the other men gathered around.\r\n\r\nWhen you get into the movement of a ball bearing disk, your body is\r\nfree to move. I know you look like you are having a gay time, because\r\nnaturally if your body is so free of moving, it is going to look that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nI am stating this in that even with my emotional feeling for our\r\nbeloved President, even to demonstrate the twist board, I did it\r\nbecause someone asked me to.\r\n\r\nYou follow me, gentlemen, as I describe it?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Then we placed the ad in, and if I recall, I requested from\r\nPat to put a black border around to show that the ad was in mourning,\r\nor something, because we were, everything was in mourning.\r\n\r\nBill, will you do that for me that you asked a minute ago? You said you\r\nwanted to leave the room.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. I will have everyone leave the room, including myself, if\r\nyou want to talk about it. You name it, and out we will go.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. You want all of us outside?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. I will leave Tonahill and Moore. I am not going to have Joe\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. If you are not going to have Joe leave----\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. Moore, his body is responsible to you. His body is\r\nresponsible to you.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Bill, I am not accomplishing anything if they are here, and\r\nJoe Tonahill is here. You asked me anybody I wanted out.\r\n\r\nMr. DECKER. Jack, this is your attorney. That is your lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He is not my lawyer.\r\n\r\n(Sheriff Decker and law enforcement officers left room.)\r\n\r\nGentleman, if you want to hear any further testimony, you will have to\r\nget me to Washington soon, because it has something to do with you,\r\nChief Warren.\r\n\r\nDo I sound sober enough to tell you this?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I want to tell the truth, and I can't tell it here. I can't\r\ntell it here. Does that make sense to you?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, let's not talk about sense. But I really\r\ncan't see why you can't tell this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. What is your name?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Joe Ball.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Joe Ball. He is an attorney from Los Angeles\r\nwho has been working for me.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Do you know Belli too?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I know of him.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Ball was working with him. He knows Belli. You know Melvin\r\nBelli?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I am not acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No association of any kind.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We practice in different cities.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Five hundred miles away. Mr. Ball practices\r\nin Long Beach, and Mr. Belli practices in San Francisco. There is\r\npositively no connection between anybody in this room, as far as I\r\nknow, with Mr. Belli. I can assure you of that.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Where do you stand, Moore?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. Well, I am assigned to the Commission, Jack.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The President assigned you?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. No; my chief did. And I am not involved in the\r\ninvestigation. I am more of a security officer.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Boys, I am in a tough spot, I tell you that.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. You recall when I talked to you, there were certain things\r\nI asked you not to tell me at the time, for certain reasons, that\r\nyou were probably going to trial at that time, and I respected your\r\nposition on that and asked you not to tell me certain things.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But this isn't the place for me to tell what I want to tell.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. The Commission is looking into the entire matter, and you\r\nare part of it, should be.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Chief Warren, your life is in danger in this city, do you\r\nknow that?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I don't know that. If that is the thing that\r\nyou don't want to talk about, you can tell me, if you wish, when this\r\nis all over, just between you and me.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; I would like to talk to you in private.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You may do that when you finish your story. You\r\nmay tell me that phase of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I bet you haven't had a witness like me in your whole\r\ninvestigation, is that correct?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. There are many witnesses whose memory has not\r\nbeen as good as yours. I tell you that, honestly.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. My reluctance to talk--you haven't had any witness in telling\r\nthe story, in finding so many problems?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You have a greater problem than any witness we\r\nhave had.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I have a lot of reasons for having those problems.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I know that, and we want to respect your rights,\r\nwhatever they may be. And I only want to hear what you are willing to\r\ntell us, because I realize that you still have a great problem before\r\nyou, and I am not trying to press you.\r\n\r\nI came here because I thought you wanted to tell us the story, and I\r\nthink the story should be told for the public, and it will eventually\r\nbe made public. If you want to do that, you are entitled to do that,\r\nand if you want to have it verified as the thing can be verified by a\r\npolygraph test, you may have that, too.\r\n\r\nI will undertake to do that for you, but at all events we must first\r\nhave the story that we are going to check it against.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. When are you going back to Washington?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I am going back very shortly after we finish this\r\nhearing--I am going to have some lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Can I make a statement?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. If you request me to go back to Washington with you right\r\nnow, that couldn't be done, could it?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; it could not be done. It could not be done.\r\nThere are a good many things involved in that, Mr. Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. What are they?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, the public attention that it would attract,\r\nand the people who would be around. We have no place there for you to\r\nbe safe when we take you out, and we are not law enforcement officers,\r\nand it isn't our responsibility to go into anything of that kind.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly it couldn't be done on a moment's notice this way.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, from what I read in the paper, they made certain\r\nprecautions for you coming here, but you got here.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. There are no precautions taken at all.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There were some remarks in the paper about some crackpots.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I don't believe everything I read in the paper.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. In that respect, the Chief Justice is in public life. People\r\nin public life are well aware they don't please everyone, and they get\r\nthese threats.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, if it is the part about George Senator talking about the\r\nEarl Warren Society, the Chief Justice is aware of that phase, and\r\nI am sure he would like to hear anything that you have to say if it\r\naffects the security.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Before you finish the rest of your statement, may\r\nI ask you this question, and this is one of the questions we came here\r\nto ask you.\r\n\r\nDid you know Lee Harvey Oswald prior to this shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That is why I want to take the lie detector test. Just saying\r\nno isn't sufficient.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I will afford you that opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I will afford you that opportunity. You can't do\r\nboth of them at one time.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Gentlemen, my life is in danger here. Not with my guilty plea\r\nof execution.\r\n\r\nDo I sound sober enough to you as I say this?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You do. You sound entirely sober.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. From the moment I started my testimony, have I sounded as\r\nthough, with the exception of becoming emotional, have I sounded as\r\nthough I made sense, what I was speaking about?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You have indeed. I understood everything you have\r\nsaid. If I haven't, it is my fault.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Then I follow this up. I may not live tomorrow to give any\r\nfurther testimony. The reason why I add this to this, since you assure\r\nme that I have been speaking sense by then, I might be speaking sense\r\nby following what I have said, and the only thing I want to get out\r\nto the public, and I can't say it here, is with authenticity, with\r\nsincerity of the truth of everything and why my act was committed, but\r\nit can't be said here.\r\n\r\nIt can be said, it's got to be said amongst people of the highest\r\nauthority that would give me the benefit of doubt. And following that,\r\nimmediately give me the lie detector test after I do make the statement.\r\n\r\nChairman Warren, if you felt that your life was in danger at the\r\nmoment, how would you feel? Wouldn't you be reluctant to go on\r\nspeaking, even though you request me to do so?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I think I might have some reluctance if I was in\r\nyour position, yes; I think I would. I think I would figure it out very\r\ncarefully as to whether it would endanger me or not.\r\n\r\nIf you think that anything that I am doing or anything that I am asking\r\nyou is endangering you in any way, shape, or form, I want you to feel\r\nabsolutely free to say that the interview is over.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. What happens then? I didn't accomplish anything.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; nothing has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, then you won't follow up with anything further?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. There wouldn't be anything to follow up if you\r\nhadn't completed your statement.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You said you have the power to do what you want to do, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Without any limitations?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Within the purview of the Executive order which\r\nestablished the Commission. We have the right to take testimony of\r\nanyone we want in this whole situation, and we have the right, if we so\r\nchoose to do it, to verify that statement in any way that we wish to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But you don't have a right to take a prisoner back with you\r\nwhen you want to?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; we have the power to subpena witnesses to\r\nWashington if we want to do it, but we have taken the testimony of\r\n200 or 300 people, I would imagine, here in Dallas without going to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; but those people aren't Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; they weren't.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. They weren't.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Now I want you to feel that we are not here to\r\ntake any advantage of you, because I know that you are in a delicate\r\nposition, and unless you had indicated not only through your lawyers\r\nbut also through your sister, who wrote a letter addressed either\r\nto me or to Mr. Rankin saying that you wanted to testify before the\r\nCommission, unless she had told us that, I wouldn't have bothered you.\r\n\r\nBecause I know you do have this case that is not yet finished, and I\r\nwouldn't jeopardize your position by trying to insist that you testify.\r\n\r\nSo I want you to feel that you are free to refrain from testifying any\r\ntime you wish.\r\n\r\nBut I will also be frank with you and say that I don't think it would\r\nbe to your advantage to tell us as much as you have and then to stop\r\nand not tell us the rest. I can't see what advantage that would give\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The thing is this, that with your power that you have, Chief\r\nJustice Warren, and all these gentlemen, too much time has gone by for\r\nme to give you any benefit of what I may say now.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; that isn't a fact, because until we make our\r\nfindings for the Commission, and until we make our report on the case,\r\nit is not too late.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other witnesses we have who are yet to be examined. So\r\nfrom our standpoint, it is timely. We are not handicapped at all by the\r\nlateness of your examination.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, it is too tragic to talk about.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Isn't it true that we waited until very late in our\r\nproceedings to talk to Mrs. Kennedy?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I might say to you that we didn't take Mrs.\r\nKennedy's statement until day before yesterday. Mr. Rankin and I took\r\nher testimony then.\r\n\r\nSo we are not treating you different from any other witness.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I tell you, gentlemen, my whole family is in jeopardy. My\r\nsisters, as to their lives.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Naturally, I am a foregone conclusion. My sisters Eva,\r\nEileen, and Mary, I lost my sisters.\r\n\r\nMy brothers Sam, Earl, Hyman, and myself naturally--my in-laws, Harold\r\nKaminsky, Marge Ruby, the wife of Earl, and Phyllis, the wife of Sam\r\nRuby, they are in jeopardy of loss of their lives. Yet they have, just\r\nbecause they are blood related to myself--does that sound serious\r\nenough to you, Chief Justice Warren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Nothing could be more serious, if that is the\r\nfact. But your sister, I don't know whether it was your sister Eva or\r\nyour other sister----\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Eileen wrote you a letter.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Wrote the letter to me and told us that you would\r\nlike to testify, and that is one of the reasons that we came down here.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But unfortunately, when did you get the letter, Chief Justice\r\nWarren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. It was a long time ago, I admit. I think it was,\r\nlet's see, roughly between 2 and 3 months ago.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I think it was; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. At that time when you first got the letter and I was begging\r\nJoe Tonahill and the other lawyers to know the truth about me, certain\r\nthings that are happening now wouldn't be happening at this particular\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Because then they would have known the truth about Jack Ruby\r\nand his emotional breakdown.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Of why that Sunday morning--that thought never entered my\r\nmind prior to that Sunday morning when I took it upon myself to try to\r\nbe a martyr or some screwball, you might say.\r\n\r\nBut I felt very emotional and very carried away for Mrs. Kennedy, that\r\nwith all the strife she had gone through--I had been following it\r\npretty well--that someone owed it to our beloved President that she\r\nshouldn't be expected to come back to face trial of this heinous crime.\r\n\r\nAnd I have never had the chance to tell that, to back it up, to prove\r\nit.\r\n\r\nConsequently, right at this moment I am being victimized as a part of a\r\nplot in the world's worst tragedy and crime at this moment.\r\n\r\nMonths back had I been given a chance--I take that back. Sometime back\r\na police officer of the Dallas Police Department wanted to know how\r\nI got into the building. And I don't know whether I requested a lie\r\ndetector test or not, but my attorney wasn't available.\r\n\r\nWhen you are a defendant in the case, you say \"speak to your attorney,\"\r\nyou know. But that was a different time. It was after the trial,\r\nwhenever it happened.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Lee Harvey Oswald isn't guilty of committing the crime\r\nof assassinating President Kennedy. Jack Ruby is.\r\n\r\nHow can I fight that, Chief Justice Warren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well now, I want to say, Mr. Ruby, that as far as\r\nthis Commission is concerned, there is no implication of that in what\r\nwe are doing.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right, there is a certain organization here----\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. That I can assure you.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There is an organization here, Chief Justice Warren, if it\r\ntakes my life at this moment to say it, and Bill Decker said be a man\r\nand say it, there is a John Birch Society right now in activity, and\r\nEdwin Walker is one of the top men of this organization--take it for\r\nwhat it is worth, Chief Justice Warren.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for me, for me giving the people the opportunity to get\r\nin power, because of the act I committed, has put a lot of people in\r\njeopardy with their lives.\r\n\r\nDon't register with you, does it?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I don't understand that.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Would you rather I just delete what I said and just pretend\r\nthat nothing is going on?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I would not indeed. I am only interested in what\r\nyou want to tell this Commission. That is all I am interested in.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, I said my life, I won't be living long now. I know\r\nthat. My family's lives will be gone. When I left my apartment that\r\nmorning----\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. What morning?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Let's go back. Saturday I watched Rabbi Seligman. Any of you\r\nwatch it that Saturday morning?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I didn't happen to hear it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He went ahead and eulogized that here is a man that fought in\r\nevery battle, went to every country, and had to come back to his own\r\ncountry to be shot in the back [starts crying].\r\n\r\nI must be a great actor, I tell you that.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That created a tremendous emotional feeling for me, the way\r\nhe said that. Prior to all the other times, I was carried away.\r\n\r\nThen that Saturday night, I didn't do anything but visit a little club\r\nover here and had a Coca-Cola, because I was sort of depressed. A\r\nfellow that owns the Pago Club, Bob Norton, and he knew something was\r\nwrong with me in the certain mood I was in.\r\n\r\nAnd I went home and that weekend, the Sunday morning, and saw a letter\r\nto Caroline, two columns about a 16-inch area. Someone had written a\r\nletter to Caroline. The most heartbreaking letter. I don't remember the\r\ncontents. Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I think I saw it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; and alongside that letter on the same sheet of paper was\r\na small comment in the newspaper that, I don't know how it was stated,\r\nthat Mrs. Kennedy may have to come back for the trial of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nThat caused me to go like I did; that caused me to go like I did.\r\n\r\nI don't know, Chief Justice, but I got so carried away. And I remember\r\nprior to that thought, there has never been another thought in my mind;\r\nI was never malicious toward this person. No one else requested me to\r\ndo anything.\r\n\r\nI never spoke to anyone about attempting to do anything. No subversive\r\norganization gave me any idea. No underworld person made any effort to\r\ncontact me. It all happened that Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I read was that Mrs. Kennedy may have to come back to\r\nDallas for trial for Lee Harvey Oswald, and I don't know what bug got\r\nahold of me. I don't know what it is, but I am going to tell the truth\r\nword for word.\r\n\r\nI am taking a pill called Preludin. It is a harmless pill, and it is\r\nvery easy to get in the drugstore. It isn't a highly prescribed pill. I\r\nuse it for dieting.\r\n\r\nI don't partake of that much food. I think that was a stimulus to give\r\nme an emotional feeling that suddenly I felt, which was so stupid, that\r\nI wanted to show my love for our faith, being of the Jewish faith, and\r\nI never used the term and I don't want to go into that--suddenly the\r\nfeeling, the emotional feeling came within me that someone owed this\r\ndebt to our beloved President to save her the ordeal of coming back. I\r\ndon't know why that came through my mind.\r\n\r\nAnd I drove past Main Street, past the County Building, and there was a\r\ncrowd already gathered there. And I guess I thought I knew he was going\r\nto be moved at 10 o'clock, I don't know. I listened to the radio; and I\r\npassed a crowd and it looked--I am repeating myself--and I took it for\r\ngranted he had already been moved.\r\n\r\nAnd I parked my car in the lot across from the Western Union. Prior\r\nto that, I got a call from a little girl--she wanted some money--that\r\nworked for me, and I said, \"Can't you wait till payday?\" And she said,\r\n\"Jack, you are going to be closed.\"\r\n\r\nSo my purpose was to go to the Western Union--my double purpose--but\r\nthe thought of doing, committing the act wasn't until I left my\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nSending the wire was when I had the phone call--or the money order.\r\n\r\nI drove down Main Street--there was a little incident I left out, that\r\nI started to go down a driveway, but I wanted to go by the wreaths, and\r\nI saw them and started to cry again.\r\n\r\nThen I drove, parked the car across from the Western Union, went into\r\nthe Western Union, sent the money order, whatever it was, walked the\r\ndistance from the Western Union to the ramp--I didn't sneak in. I\r\ndidn't linger in there.\r\n\r\nI didn't crouch or hide behind anyone, unless the television camera can\r\nmake it seem that way.\r\n\r\nThere was an officer talking--I don't know what rank he had--talking to\r\na Sam Pease in a car parked up on the curb.\r\n\r\nI walked down those few steps, and there was the person that--I\r\nwouldn't say I saw red--it was a feeling I had for our beloved\r\nPresident and Mrs. Kennedy, that he was insignificant to what my\r\npurpose was.\r\n\r\nAnd when I walked down the ramp--I would say there was an 8-foot\r\nclearance--not that I wanted to be a hero, or I didn't realize that\r\neven if the officer would have observed me, the klieg lights, but I\r\ncan't take that.\r\n\r\nI did not mingle with the crowd. There was no one near me when I walked\r\ndown that ramp, because if you will time the time I sent the money\r\norder, I think it was 10:17 Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nI think the actual act was committed--I take that back--was it 11\r\no'clock? You should know this.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. 11:21.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; when Oswald was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I understood it to be 11:22.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The clock stopped and said 11:21. I was watching on that\r\nthing; yes. Then it must have been 11:17, closer to 18. That is the\r\ntiming when I left the Western Union to the time of the bottom of the\r\nramp.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't have time enough to have any conspiracy, to be\r\nself-saving, to mingle with the crowd, as it was told about me.\r\n\r\nI realize it is a terrible thing I have done, and it was a stupid\r\nthing, but I just was carried away emotionally. Do you follow that?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; I do indeed, every word.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I had the gun in my right hip pocket, and impulsively, if\r\nthat is the correct word here, I saw him, and that is all I can say.\r\nAnd I didn't care what happened to me.\r\n\r\nI think I used the words, \"You killed my President, you rat.\" The next\r\nthing, I was down on the floor.\r\n\r\nI said, \"I am Jack Ruby. You all know me.\"\r\n\r\nI never used anything malicious, nothing like s.o.b. I never said that\r\nI wanted to get three more off, as they stated.\r\n\r\nThe only words, and I was highly emotional; to Ray Hall--he\r\ninterrogated more than any other person down there--all I believe I\r\nsaid to him was, \"I didn't want Mrs. Kennedy to come back to trial.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I forget what else. And I used a little expression like being of\r\nthe Jewish faith, I wanted to show that we love our President, even\r\nthough we are not of the same faith.\r\n\r\nAnd I have a friend of mine--do you mind if it is a slipshod story?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; you tell us in your own way.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. A fellow whom I sort of idolized is of the Catholic faith,\r\nand a gambler. Naturally in my business you meet people of various\r\nbackgrounds.\r\n\r\nAnd the thought came, we were very close, and I always thought a lot of\r\nhim, and I knew that Kennedy, being Catholic, I knew how heartbroken\r\nhe was, and even his picture--of this Mr. McWillie--flashed across me,\r\nbecause I have a great fondness for him.\r\n\r\nAll that blended into the thing that, like a screwball, the way it\r\nturned out, that I thought that I would sacrifice myself for the few\r\nmoments of saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial.\r\n\r\nNow all these things of my background, I should have been the last\r\nperson in the world to want to be a martyr. It happens, doesn't it,\r\nChief Warren?\r\n\r\nI mean, for instance, I have been in the night club business, a\r\nburlesque house. It was a means of a livelihood. I knew persons of\r\nnotorious backgrounds years ago in Chicago. I was with the union\r\nback in Chicago, and I left the union when I found out the notorious\r\norganization had moved in there. It was in 1940.\r\n\r\nThen recently, I had to make so many numerous calls that I am sure you\r\nknow of. Am I right? Because of trying to survive in my business.\r\n\r\nMy unfair competition had been running certain shows that we were\r\nrestricted to run by regulation of the union, but they violated all the\r\nrules of the union, and I didn't violate it, and consequently I was\r\nbecoming insolvent because of it.\r\n\r\nAll those calls were made with only, in relation to seeing if they can\r\nhelp out, with the American Guild of Variety Artists. Does that confirm\r\na lot of things you have heard?\r\n\r\nEvery person I have called, and sometimes you may not even know a\r\nperson intimately, you sort of tell them, well, you are stranded down\r\nhere and you want some help--if they know of any official of the\r\nAmerican Guild of Variety Artists to help me. Because my competitors\r\nwere putting me out of business.\r\n\r\nI even flew to New York to see Joe Glazer, and he called Bobby Faye. He\r\nwas the national president. That didn't help. He called Barney Ross and\r\nJoey Adams. All these phone calls were related not in anyway involved\r\nwith the underworld, because I have been away from Chicago 17 years\r\ndown in Dallas.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I even called a Mr.--hold it before I say\r\nit--headed the American Federation of Labor--I can't think--in the\r\nState of Texas--Miller.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Is there a Deutsch I. Maylor? I called a Mr. Maylor here in\r\nTexas to see if he could help me out.\r\n\r\nI want to set you gentlemen straight on all the telephone calls I\r\nhad. This was a long time prior to what has happened. And the only\r\nassociation I had with those calls, the only questions that I inquired\r\nabout, was if they could help me with the American Guild of Variety\r\nArtists, to see that they abolished it, because it was unfair to\r\nprofessional talent, abolish them from putting on their shows in\r\nDallas. That is the only reason I made those calls. Where do we go from\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I will go back to the original question\r\nthat I asked you. Did you ever know Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; let me add--you are refreshing my mind about a few\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nCan I ask one thing? Did you all talk to Mr. McWillie? I am sure you\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nVOICE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He always wanted me to come down to Havana, Cuba; invited me\r\ndown there, and I didn't want to leave my business because I had to\r\nwatch over it.\r\n\r\nHe was a key man over the Tropicana down there. That was during our\r\ngood times. Was in harmony with our enemy of our present time.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I refused. I couldn't make it. Finally he sent me tickets to\r\ncome down, airplane tickets.\r\n\r\nI made the trip down there via New Orleans, and so I stayed at the\r\nVolk's Apartments, and I was with him constantly.\r\n\r\nAnd I was bored with the gambling, because I don't gamble, and there is\r\nnothing exciting unless you can speak their language, which is Spanish,\r\nI believe.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the only environment. That was in August of 1959.\r\n\r\nAny thought of ever being close to Havana, Cuba, I called him\r\nfrequently because he was down there, and he was the last person to\r\nleave, if I recall, when they had to leave, when he left the casino.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, on the plane, if I recall, I had an article he\r\nsent me, and I wanted to get it published because I idolized McWillie.\r\nHe is a pretty nice boy, and I happened to be idolizing him.\r\n\r\nWhen the plane left Havana and landed in the United States, some\r\nschoolteacher remarked that the United States is not treating Castro\r\nright. When they landed in the United States, this Mr. Louis McWillie\r\nslugged this guy for making that comment.\r\n\r\nSo I want you to know, as far as him having any subversive thoughts,\r\nand I wanted Tony to put it in the paper here. That is how much I\r\nthought of Mr. McWillie. And that is my only association.\r\n\r\nThe only other association with him was, there was a gentleman here\r\nthat sells guns. He has a hardware store on Singleton Avenue.\r\n\r\nHave I told this to you gentlemen? It is Ray's Hardware. His name is\r\nRay Brantley.\r\n\r\nThis was--I don't recall when he called me, but he was a little worried\r\nof the new regime coming in, and evidently he wanted some protection.\r\n\r\nHe called me or sent me a letter that I should call Ray Brantley. He\r\nwanted some four little Cobra guns--big shipment.\r\n\r\nSo me, I should say myself rather, feeling no harm, I didn't realize,\r\nbecause he wasn't sending them to me, and I thought there was no crime,\r\nthe man wanted protection, he is earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\nI called Ray Brantley and I said, \"Ray, McWillie called me.\" I don't\r\nremember if he sent me a letter or he called. He said he wants four\r\nlittle Cobras, or something like that.\r\n\r\nHe said \"I know Mac. I have been doing business with him for a long\r\ntime.\" Meaning with reference to when he was living in Texas. He did a\r\nlot of hunting and things like that.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That was the only relationship I had of any mention, outside\r\nof phone calls, to Mr. McWillie, or any person from Havana, Cuba.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. When was that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Now the guns--am I correct? Did you ever go to check on it?\r\nOn Ray Brantley?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He denies I ever called. Evidently he feels, maybe he feels\r\nit would be illegal to send guns out of the country. I don't know if\r\nyou gentlemen know the law. I don't know the law.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I kept--did I tell you this, Joe, about this?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Yes; you did.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That I wanted someone to go to Ray Brantley?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. When Phil Burleson came back with a letter signed, an\r\naffidavit that Ray Brantley said he never did receive a call from me,\r\nand the only gun he sent to McWillie was to the Vegas, but it came back\r\nthat they didn't pick it up because it was a c.o.d. order.\r\n\r\nThis definitely would do me more harm, because if I tell my story that\r\nI called Ray Brantley, and he denies that he ever got a call from me,\r\ndefinitely that makes it look like I am hiding something.\r\n\r\nHaven't I felt that right along, Joe?\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. You sure have, Jack.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Now, the reason I am telling you these things, I never knew\r\nLee Harvey Oswald. The first time I ever have seen him was the time in\r\nthe assembly room when they brought him out, when he had some sort of a\r\nshiner on his eye.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. When was that little incident about the Cobras?\r\nAbout what year? That is all I am interested in.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Could have been prior to the early part of 1959.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; all right.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That is the only call I made. And as a matter of fact, I\r\ndidn't even follow up to inquire of this Mr. Brantley, whether he\r\nreceived it or what the recourse was. That is why I tell you, Chief\r\nJustice Warren--who is this new gentleman, may I ask?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This is Mr. Storey from your community, a lawyer who is\r\nworking with the attorney general, and Mr. Jaworski, in connection with\r\nwatching the work of the Commission so that they will be satisfied\r\nas to the quality of the work done insofar as the State of Texas is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n(Pause for reporter to change paper, and Ruby asked about one of the\r\ngentlemen, to which Chief Justice Warren replied as follows):\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN (referring to Mr. Specter). He has been working\r\nwith us on the Commission since very close to the beginning now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long did you spend in Cuba on this trip?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Eight days. A lot of your tourists were there. As a matter of\r\nfact, a lot of group tourists were going down, students of schools.\r\n\r\nI mean, he had a way of purchasing tickets from Havana that I think he\r\npurchased them at a lesser price. He bought them from the travel agent\r\nin the Capri Hotel.\r\n\r\nHe bought them--did you meet McWillie?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He was checked by the Commission in connection with this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. There was some story in one of the papers that\r\nyou had been interested in shipping jeeps down to Cuba. Was there\r\nanything to that at all?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; but this was the earlier part, when the first time Castro\r\nhad ever invaded Cuba. There was even a Government article that they\r\nwould need jeeps. I don't recall what it was, but I never had the\r\nfacilities or the capabilities of knowing where to get jeeps.\r\n\r\nBut probably in conversation with other persons--you see, it is a new\r\nland, and they have to have a lot of things. As a matter of fact, the\r\nU.S. Government was wanting persons to help them at that particular\r\ntime when they threw out the dictator, Batista.\r\n\r\nAnd one particular time there was a gentleman that smuggled guns to\r\nCastro. I think I told you that, Mr. Moore; I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I don't recall that.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I think his name was Longley out of Bay--something--Texas, on\r\nthe Bayshore. And somehow he was, I read the article about him, that he\r\nwas given a jail term for smuggling guns to Castro. This is the early\r\npart of their revolution.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Before the Batista government fell?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; I think he had a boat, and he lived somewhere in Bay\r\nsomething, Bayshore, in the center part of Texas. Do you know him, Mr.\r\nStorey? Do you know this man?\r\n\r\nMr. STOREY. No; I don't know him.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. How can I prove my authenticity of what I have stated here\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, you have testified under oath, and I don't\r\neven know that there is anything to disprove what you have said.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; because I will say this. You don't know if there\r\nis anything to disprove, but at this moment, there is a certain\r\norganization in this area that has been indoctrinated, that I am the\r\none that was in the plot to assassinate our President.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell us what that is?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The John Birch Society.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us what basis you have for that, Mr. Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Just a feeling of it. Mr. Warren, you don't recall when\r\nI--Friday night after leaving the Times Herald, I went to my apartment\r\nand very impatiently awakened George Senator. As a matter of fact, used\r\nthe words, as I state, \"You will have to get up, George. I want you to\r\ngo with me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he had been in bed for a couple of hours, which was about, I\r\nimagine, about 4:30 or a quarter to 5 in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd I called the club and I asked this kid Larry if he knew how to pack\r\na Polaroid, and he said \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Get up.\" And we went down and picked up Larry. And in the\r\nmeantime, I don't recall if I stopped at the post office to find out\r\nhis box number of this Bernard Weissman. I think the box number was\r\n1792, or something to that; and then there was, it came to my mind when\r\nI left the Times Herald--I am skipping back--why I had awakened George.\r\n\r\nI recall seeing a sign on a certain billboard \"Impeach Earl Warren.\"\r\nYou have heard something about that?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I read something in the paper, yes; that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. And it came from New Bedford, or Massachusetts; I don't\r\nrecall what the town was.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a similar number to that, but I thought at the time it\r\nwould be the same number of 1792, but it was 1757.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason I went down there to take the Polaroid picture of\r\nit, because of that remaining in the city at the time.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the picture, I don't know. I asked Jim Bowie or\r\nAlexander to tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know Weissman before that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Never knew him. When I said Jim Bowie, no one says a word.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWIE. We never have seen them.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. They were in my person.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWIE. But no evidence came?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; it did not, never. As a matter of fact, I went to the\r\npost office to check on box 1792. I even inquired with the man in\r\ncharge of where you purchase the boxes, and I said to him, \"Who bought\r\nthis box?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"I can't give you the information. All I know is, it is a\r\nlegitimate business box purchase.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I checked the various contents of mail there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I knew there was three Tippits on the force. The only one\r\nI knew used to work for the special services, and I am certain this\r\nwasn't the Tippit, this wasn't the man.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The man that was murdered. There was a story that you were\r\nseen sitting in your Carousel Club with Mr. Weissman, Officer Tippit,\r\nand another who has been called a rich oil man, at one time shortly\r\nbefore the assassination. Can you tell us anything about that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Who was the rich oil man?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you remember? We haven't been told. We are just trying\r\nto find out anything that you know about him.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I am the one that made such a big issue of Bernard Weissman's\r\nad. Maybe you do things to cover up, if you are capable of doing it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Saturday afternoon we went over to the Turf Bar\r\nlounge, and it was a whole hullabaloo, and I showed the pictures\r\n\"Impeach Earl Warren\" to Bellocchio, and he saw the pictures and got\r\nvery emotional.\r\n\r\nAnd Bellocchio said, \"Why did the newspaper take this ad of Weissman?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Bellocchio said, \"I have got to leave Dallas.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly after making that statement, I realized it is his\r\nincapability, and suddenly you do things impulsively, and suddenly you\r\nrealize if you love the city, you stay here and you make the best of\r\nit. And there were witnesses.\r\n\r\nI said, \"The city was good enough for you all before this. Now you feel\r\nthat way about it.\" And that was Bellocchio.\r\n\r\nAs far as Tippit, it is not Tippitts, it is not Tippitts it is Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This Weissman and the rich oil man, did you ever have a\r\nconversation with them?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There was only a few. Bill Rudman from the YMCA, and I\r\nhaven't seen him in years.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a Bill Howard, but he is not a rich oil man. He owns the\r\nStork Club now. He used to dabble in oil.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. This story was given by a lawyer by the name of\r\nMark Lane, who is representing Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, the mother of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald, and it was in the paper, so we subpenaed him, and\r\nhe testified that someone had given him information to the effect that\r\na week or two before President Kennedy was assassinated, that in your\r\nCarousel Club you and Weissman and Tippit, Officer Tippit, the one who\r\nwas killed, and a rich oil man had an interview or conversation for an\r\nhour or two.\r\n\r\nAnd we asked him who it was that told him, and he said that it was\r\nconfidential and he couldn't tell at the moment, but that he would find\r\nout for us if whether he could be released or not from his confidential\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nHe has never done it, and we have written him several letters asking\r\nhim to disclose the name of that person, and he has never complied.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Isn't that foolish? If a man is patriotic enough in the first\r\nplace, who am I to be concerned if he wasn't an informer.\r\n\r\nI am incarcerated, nothing to be worried about anyone hurting me.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, I am not questioning your story at all.\r\nI wanted you to know the background of this thing, and to know that it\r\nwas with us only hearsay. But I did feel that our record should show\r\nthat we would ask you the question and that you would answer it, and\r\nyou have answered it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. How many days prior to the assassination was that?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. My recollection is that it was a week or two. Is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Did anyone have any knowledge that their beloved President\r\nwas going to visit here prior to that time, or what is the definite\r\ntime that they knew he was coming to Dallas?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I don't know just what those dates are.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I see.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I just don't know. Well, we wanted to ask you\r\nthat question, because this man had so testified, and we have been\r\ntrying ever since to get him to give the source of his information, but\r\nhe will not do it, so we will leave that matter as it is.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; I am as innocent regarding any conspiracy as any of\r\nyou gentlemen in the room, and I don't want anything to be run over\r\nlightly. I want you to dig into it with any biting, any question that\r\nmight embarrass me, or anything that might bring up my background,\r\nwhich isn't so terribly spotted--I have never been a criminal--I have\r\nnever been in jail--I know when you live in the city of Chicago and\r\nyou are in the livelihood of selling tickets to sporting events, your\r\nlucrative patrons are some of these people, but you don't mean anything\r\nto those people. You may know them as you get acquainted with them at\r\nthe sporting events or the ball park.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. The prizefights?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The prizefights. If that was your means of livelihood,\r\nyet you don't have no other affiliation with them, so when I say I\r\nknow them, or what I have read from stories of personalities that\r\nare notorious, that is the extent of my involvement in any criminal\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nI have never been a bookmaker. I have never stolen for a living. I am\r\nnot a gangster. I have never used a goon squad for union activities.\r\n\r\nAll I was was a representative to sound out applications for the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor, and if the employees would sign it, we\r\nwould accept them as members.\r\n\r\nI never knew what a goon looked like in Chicago, with the exception\r\nwhen I went to the service.\r\n\r\nI never belonged to any subversive organization. I don't know any\r\nsubversive people that are against my beloved country.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have never been connected with the Communist Party?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Never have. All I have ever done in my life--I had a very\r\nrough start in life, but anything I have done, I at least try to do it\r\nin good taste, whatever I have been active in.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There was a story that you had a gun with you during the\r\nshowup that you described in the large room there.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I will be honest with you. I lied about it. It isn't so. I\r\ndidn't have a gun. But in order to make my defense more accurate, to\r\nsave your life, that is the reason that statement was made.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It would be quite helpful to the Commission if you\r\ncould--in the first place, I want to get the trip to Cuba. Was that in\r\n1959?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; because I had to buy a $2 ticket, a pass to get through\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have any other trip to Cuba?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Never; that is the only one that I made.\r\n\r\nI stayed at the Volk's Apartments with Mr. McWillie, lived in his\r\napartment. Ate directly in a place called Wolf's, downstairs. Wouldn't\r\nknow how to speak their language. I wouldn't know how to communicate\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nI probably had two dates from meeting some young ladies I got to\r\ndancing with, because my dinners were served in the Tropicana.\r\n\r\nOne thing I forgot to tell you--you are bringing my mind back to a few\r\nthings--the owners, the greatest that have been expelled from Cuba, are\r\nthe Fox brothers. They own the Tropicana.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who are the Fox brothers?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Martin Fox and I can't think of the other name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know where they are located now?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. They are in Miami, Fla. They know everything about McWillie,\r\nI heard; and know the officials.\r\n\r\nI met McWillie because he came to the club, and he came to the club to\r\nlook over the show. And you get to talk to people and meet a lot of\r\ndifferent types of people.\r\n\r\nThe Fox brothers came to Dallas--I don't know which one it was--to\r\ncollect a debt that some man owed the Cotton Gin Co. here.\r\n\r\nDo you know their name, Mr. Bowie?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWIE. Murray, or something.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He gave some bad checks on a gambling debt, and they came to\r\nvisit me. The lawyer, I think, is Mark Lane. That is the attorney that\r\nwas killed in New York?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. That is the fellow who represents, or did\r\nrepresent Mrs. Marguerite Oswald. I think I read in the paper where he\r\nno longer represents her.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He is still alive though.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There was one Lane that was killed in a taxicab. I thought he\r\nwas an attorney in Dallas.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. That was a Dave Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There is a very prominent attorney in Dallas, McCord. McCord\r\nrepresents the Fox brothers here. They called me because the Fox\r\nbrothers wanted to see me, and I came down to the hotel.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. McWillie--Mr. McWillie was married to her at that time--and if\r\nI recall, I didn't show them off to the airport at that time.\r\n\r\nThis is when they were still living in Havana, the Fox brothers. We had\r\ndinner at--how do you pronounce that restaurant at Love Field? Luau?\r\nThat serves this Chinese food.\r\n\r\nDave McCord, I was in his presence, and I was invited out to dinner,\r\nand there was an attorney by the name of Leon. Is he associated with\r\nMcCord?\r\n\r\nAnd there was a McClain.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Alfred was killed in a taxi in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. He was at this dinner meeting I had with McCord. I don't know\r\nif Mrs. McWillie was along. And one of the Fox brothers, because they\r\nhad just been awarded the case that this person owns, this Gin Co.,\r\nthat was compelled to pay off.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think, Mr. Ruby, it would be quite helpful to the\r\nCommission if you could tell, as you recall it, just what you said to\r\nMr. Sorrels and the others after the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald. Can\r\nyou recall that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The only one I recall Mr. Sorrels in, there were some\r\nincorrect statements made at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us what you said?\r\n\r\nCongressman FORD. First, tell us when this took place.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How soon after the shooting occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, Ray Hall was the first one that interrogated me. Wanted\r\nto know my whole background.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us how soon it was? Within a few minutes after\r\nthe shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; I waited in a little room there somewhere upstairs in--I\r\ndon't know what floor it was. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did this occur, on the third floor?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. One of those floors. I don't know whether it was the third or\r\nsecond. If you are up on an elevator----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you give us any idea of the time after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I spent an hour with Mr. Hall, Ray Hall. And I was very much,\r\nI was very much broken up emotionally, and I constantly repeated that\r\nI didn't want Mrs. Kennedy to come back to trial, and those were my\r\nwords, constantly repeated to Mr. Hall.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard there was a statement made--now I am skipping--and then I\r\ngave Mr. Hall my complete background about things he wanted to know,\r\nmy earlier background going back from the years, and I guess there\r\nwas nothing else to say to Hall because as long as I stated why I did\r\nit--it is not like planning a crime and you are confessing something. I\r\nalready confessed, and all it took is one sentence why I did it.\r\n\r\nNow what else could I have said that you think I could have said?\r\nRefresh my memory a little bit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There was a conversation with Mr. Sorrels in which you told\r\nhim about the matter. Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The only thing I ever recall I said to Mr. Ray Hall and\r\nSorrels was, I said, \"Being of Jewish faith, I wanted to show my love\r\nfor my President and his lovely wife.\"\r\n\r\nAfter I said whatever I said, then a statement came out that someone\r\nintroduced Mr. Sorrels to me and I said, \"What are you, a newsman?\" Or\r\nsomething to that effect. Which is really--what I am trying to say is,\r\nthe way it sounded is like I was looking for publicity and inquiring if\r\nyou are a newsman, I wanted to see you.\r\n\r\nBut I am certain--I don't recall definitely, but I know in my right\r\nmind, because I know my motive for doing it, and certainly to gain\r\npublicity to take a chance of being mortally wounded, as I said before,\r\nand who else could have timed it so perfectly by seconds.\r\n\r\nIf it were timed that way, then someone in the police department is\r\nguilty of giving the information as to when Lee Harvey Oswald was\r\ncoming down.\r\n\r\nI never made a statement. I never inquired from the television man what\r\ntime is Lee Harvey Oswald coming down. Because really, a man in his\r\nright mind would never ask that question. I never made the statement\r\n\"I wanted to get three more off. Someone had to do it. You wouldn't do\r\nit.\" I never made those statements.\r\n\r\nI never called the man by any obscene name, because as I stated\r\nearlier, there was no malice in me. He was insignificant, to my\r\nfeelings for my love for Mrs. Kennedy and our beloved President. He was\r\nnothing comparable to them, so I can't explain it.\r\n\r\nI never used any words--as a matter of fact, there were questions at\r\nthe hearing with Roy Pryor and a few others--I may have used one word\r\n\"a little weasel\" or something, but I didn't use it. I don't remember,\r\nbecause Roy said it. If he said I did, I may have said it.\r\n\r\nI never made the statement to anyone that I intended to get him. I\r\nnever used the obscene words that were stated.\r\n\r\nAnything I said was with emotional feeling of I didn't want Mrs.\r\nKennedy to come back to trial.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It has been alleged that you went out to Parkland\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; I didn't go there. They tried to ask me. My sisters asked\r\nme. Some people told my sister that you were there. I am of sound mind.\r\nI never went there. Everything that transpired during the tragedy, I\r\nwas at the Morning News Building.\r\n\r\nCongressman FORD. You didn't go out there subsequent to the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; in other words, like somebody is trying to make me\r\nsomething of a martyr in that case. No; I never did.\r\n\r\nDoes this conflict with my story and yours in great length?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. Substantially the same, Jack, as well as I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything about people of your religion have\r\nguts, or something like that?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I said it. I never said it up there. I said, I could have\r\nsaid, \"Weren't you afraid of getting your head blown off?\" I said,\r\n\"Well, to be truthful, I have a little nerve.\" I could have said that.\r\n\r\nNow I could have said to the doctor that was sent to me, Bromberg,\r\nbecause there is a certain familiarity you have, because it is like you\r\nhave an attorney representing you, it is there. I mean, it is there.\r\n\r\nBut I did say this. McWillie made a statement about me, something to\r\nthe effect that \"he is considered a pretty rough guy,\" this McWillie.\r\nHe said, \"One thing about Jack Ruby, he runs this club and no one runs\r\nover him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you have a different type of entertainment here than any other part\r\nof the country, our type of entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut I don't recall that. I could have said the sentimental feeling that\r\nI may have used.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you flew to Cuba, where did you go from\r\nDallas en route? What was the step-by-step process by which you arrived\r\nat Havana?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I think I told Mr. Moore I stopped in New Orleans. Sometime\r\nI stopped in New Orleans, and I don't remember if I stopped in Florida\r\nor New Orleans, but I know I did stop in New Orleans, because I bought\r\nsome Carioca rum coming back.\r\n\r\nI know I was to Miami on a stopover. It could have been on the way\r\nback. I only went to Cuba once, so naturally, when I bought the\r\nCarioca rum, there was a couple of fellows that sell tickets for Delta\r\nAirlines, and they know me like I know you, and I am sure you gentlemen\r\nhave spoken to them, and they were to tell me where to go in Havana,\r\nand have a ball, and I told them why I was going there, and who I was\r\ngoing to look up, and everything else.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. They were Delta Airlines employees in New Orleans\r\nor Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; in New Orleans. Evidently I went out to the Delta\r\nAirlines at Love Field and caught the plane. I may have taken the\r\nflight--here is what could have happened. I could have made a double\r\nstop from Havana on the way back in taking in Miami, and then taking\r\nanother plane to New Orleans, I am not certain.\r\n\r\nBut I only made one trip to Havana. Yet I know I was in Miami, Fla. and\r\nI was in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nAnd the next time I went to New Orleans, when I tried to look up some\r\nshowgirl by the name of Jada, I stopped in to see the same fellows at\r\nDelta Airlines.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall going up the elevator after the shooting of\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That is so small to remember, I guess it is automatic, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have this gun a long while that you did the\r\nshooting with?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't carry it all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I did. I had it in a little bag with money constantly. I\r\ncarry my money.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Congressman, do you have anything further?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You can get more out of me. Let's not break up too soon.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you got to Havana, who met you in Havana?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. McWillie. Now here is what happened. One of the Fox brothers\r\ncame to visit me in Dallas with his wife. They came to the Vegas Club\r\nwith Mrs. McWillie, and we had taken some pictures. 8 x 10's.\r\n\r\nEvidently the Foxes were in exile at that time, because when I went to\r\nvisit McWillie, when he sent me the plane tickets, they looked through\r\nmy luggage and they saw a photograph of Mr. Fox and his wife. They\r\ndidn't interrogate, but they went through everything and held me up for\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Castro employees?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; because evidently, in my ignorance, I didn't realize I\r\nwas bringing a picture that they knew was a bitter enemy. At that time\r\nthey knew that the Fox brothers weren't going to jail, or something was\r\ngoing to happen.\r\n\r\nWhether it was they were in exile at that time. I don't know.\r\n\r\nBut they came to my club, the Vegas Club, and we had taken pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. McWillie was waiting for me, and he saw me go through the customs\r\nline for a couple of hours, and he said, \"Jack, they never did this to\r\nanyone before.\" Evidently, they had me pretty well lined up as to where\r\nI come in the picture of Mr. Rivera Fox. I can't think of his name.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You spent 8 days there in Havana?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; approximately.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you stayed at the apartment of Mr.----\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Volk's Apartments. I never used the phone. I wouldn't know\r\nhow to use the phone. Probably to call back to Dallas. And the only\r\ntime, Mr. McWillie had to be at the club early, so I remained a little\r\nlater in town--not often--because I saved money when I rode with him,\r\nbecause they charge you quite a bit. But I didn't want to get there too\r\nearly, because to get there at 7 o'clock wasn't very lively.\r\n\r\nBecause I would always be with him for the complete evening.\r\n\r\nWe leave the place and stop somewhere to get coffee, a little\r\ndugout--I saw Ava Gardner down there at the time when I was there. She\r\nwas visiting there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted you to leave at the end of 8 days?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I was bored because gambling isn't my profession, and when\r\nyou have a business to run, and there weren't many tourists I could get\r\nacquainted with there.\r\n\r\nI went to the Capri rooftop to go swimming, and went to the Nacional to\r\ngo swimming once.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever go to Mexico? Have you ever been to\r\nMexico?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The only time, 30 or 40 years ago, 1934.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This trip to Cuba was the only time you left the\r\ncountry other than military service?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Actually I didn't leave in the military. I was stationed\r\nthree and a half years here in the States. Let's see, never out of the\r\nUnited States except at one time to Havana, Cuba.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Now you said there were some other things. Would\r\nyou mind telling us anything you have on your mind?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; because as I said earlier, you seem to have gotten the\r\njuicy part of the story up to now in the various spasmodic way of my\r\ntelling it.\r\n\r\nHow valuable am I to you to give you all this information?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, how valuable is rather an indefinite term,\r\nbut I think it is very helpful to our Commission report. I think the\r\nreport would have been deficient if it had not been for this interview\r\nwe have had with you.\r\n\r\nSo we are interested in anything that you would like to tell us, in\r\nyour own language.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. The only thing is this. If I cannot get these tests you give,\r\nit is pretty haphazard to tell you the things I should tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, you seem to have known more about my interrogation than\r\nanybody else, right?\r\n\r\nMr. MOORE. I think you have told us about everything you told me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It isn't entirely clear how you feel that your family\r\nand you yourself are threatened by your telling what you have to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nHow do you come to the conclusion that they might be killed? Will you\r\ntell us a little bit more about that, if you can?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, assuming that, as I stated before, some persons are\r\naccusing me falsely of being part of the plot--naturally, in all the\r\ntime from over 6 months ago, my family has been so interested in\r\nhelping me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By that, you mean a party to the plot of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. That I was party to a plot to silence Oswald.\r\n\r\nAll right now, when your family believes you and knows your mannerisms\r\nand your thoughts, and knows your sincerity, they have lived with you\r\nall your life and know your emotional feelings and your patriotism--on\r\nthe surface, they see me only as the guilty assailant of Oswald, and by\r\nhelping me like they have, going all out.\r\n\r\nMy brother who has a successful business, I know he is going to be\r\nkilled. And I haven't seen him in years. And suddenly he feels that he\r\nwants to help me, because he believes that I couldn't be any further\r\ninvolved than the actual----\r\n\r\nWhen I told him I did it because of Mrs. Kennedy, that is all he had\r\nto hear, because I would never involve my family or involve him in a\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nEveryone haven't let me down. Because they read the newspapers away\r\nfrom Dallas that stated certain facts about me, but they are untrue,\r\nbecause they wouldn't come out and put those things in the newspapers\r\nthat they should be putting in; and people outside of Dallas read\r\nthe Dallas newspapers and are all in sympathy with me, as far as the\r\ncountry itself.\r\n\r\nThat they felt, well, Jack did it. They probably felt they would do the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nThat sympathy isn't going to help me, because the people that have the\r\npower here, they have a different verdict. They already have me as the\r\naccused assassin of our beloved President.\r\n\r\nNow if I sound screwy telling you this, then I must be screwy.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, I think you are entitled to a statement\r\nto this effect, because you have been frank with us and have told us\r\nyour story.\r\n\r\nI think I can say to you that there has been no witness before this\r\nCommission out of the hundreds we have questioned who has claimed to\r\nhave any personal knowledge that you were a party to any conspiracy to\r\nkill our President.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; but you don't know this area here.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I don't vouch for anything except that I\r\nthink I am correct in that, am I not?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I just wanted to tell you before our own\r\nCommission, and I might say to you also that we have explored the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I know, but I want to say this to you. If certain people have\r\nthe means and want to gain something by propagandizing something to\r\ntheir own use, they will make ways to present certain things that I do\r\nlook guilty.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well. I will make this additional statement to\r\nyou, that if any witness should testify before the Commission that you\r\nwere, to their knowledge, a party to any conspiracy to assassinate the\r\nPresident, I assure you that we will give you the opportunity to deny\r\nit and to take any tests that you may desire to so disprove it.\r\n\r\nI don't anticipate that there will be any such testimony, but should\r\nthere be, we will give you that opportunity.\r\n\r\nDoes that seem fair?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; that isn't going to save my family.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, we can't do everything at once.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I am in a tough spot, and I don't know what the solution can\r\nbe to save me.\r\n\r\nAnd I know our wonderful President, Lyndon Johnson, as soon as he was\r\nthe President of his country, he appointed you as head of this group.\r\nBut through certain falsehoods that have been said about me to other\r\npeople, the John Birch Society, I am as good as guilty as the accused\r\nassassin of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nHow can you remedy that, Mr. Warren? Do any of you men have any ways of\r\nremedying that?\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Decker said be a man and speak up. I am making a statement now\r\nthat I may not live the next hour when I walk out of this room.\r\n\r\nNow it is the most fantastic story you have ever heard in a lifetime.\r\nI did something out of the goodness of my heart. Unfortunately, Chief\r\nEarl Warren, had you been around 5 or 6 months ago, and I know your\r\nhands were tied, you couldn't do it, and immediately the President\r\nwould have gotten ahold of my true story, or whatever would have been\r\nsaid about me, a certain organization wouldn't have so completely\r\nformed now, so powerfully, to use me because I am of the Jewish\r\nextraction, Jewish faith, to commit the most dastardly crime that has\r\never been committed.\r\n\r\nCan you understand now in visualizing, what happened, what powers, what\r\nmomentum has been carried on to create this feeling of mass feeling\r\nagainst my people, against certain people that were against them prior\r\nto their power?\r\n\r\nThat goes over your head, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I don't quite get the full significance of\r\nit, Mr. Ruby. I know what you feel about the John Birch Society.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Very powerful.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I think it is powerful, yes I do. Of course, I\r\ndon't have all the information that you feel you have on that subject.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Unfortunately, you don't have, because it is too late. And\r\nI wish that our beloved President, Lyndon Johnson, would have delved\r\ndeeper into the situation, hear me, not to accept just circumstantial\r\nfacts about my guilt or innocence, and would have questioned to find\r\nout the truth about me before he relinquished certain powers to these\r\ncertain people.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I am afraid I don't know what power you\r\nbelieve he relinquished to them. I think that it is difficult to\r\nunderstand what you have to say.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I want to say this to you. The Jewish people are being\r\nexterminated at this moment. Consequently, a whole new form of\r\ngovernment is going to take over our country, and I know I won't live\r\nto see you another time.\r\n\r\nDo I sound sort of screwy in telling you these things?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. No; I think that is what you believe, or you\r\nwouldn't tell it under your oath.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But it is a very serious situation. I guess it is too late to\r\nstop it, isn't it?\r\n\r\nAll right, I want to ask you this. All you men have been chosen by the\r\nPresident for this committee, is that correct?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Representative Ford and I are the only members of\r\nthe Commission that are here.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin of the Commission is employed as our chief counsel.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin employed Mr. Specter and Mr. Ball as members of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou know who the other gentlemen here are.\r\n\r\nYou know that Mr. Moore is a member of the Secret Service, and he has\r\nbeen a liaison officer with our staff since the Commission was formed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are there any questions that ought to be asked to\r\nhelp clarify the situation that you described?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. There is only one thing. If you don't take me back to\r\nWashington tonight to give me a chance to prove to the President that I\r\nam not guilty, then you will see the most tragic thing that will ever\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't have the power to take me back, I won't be around to\r\nbe able to prove my innocence or guilt.\r\n\r\nNow up to this moment, I have been talking with you for how long?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. I would say for the better part of 3 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All right, wouldn't it be ridiculous for me to speak sensibly\r\nall this time and give you this climactic talk that I have?\r\n\r\nMaybe something can be saved, something can be done.\r\n\r\nWhat have you got to answer to that, Chief Justice Warren?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I don't know what can be done. Mr. Ruby,\r\nbecause I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there anything more you can tell us if you went\r\nback to Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; are you sincere in wanting to take me back?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. We are most interested in all the information you\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All I know is maybe something can be saved. Because right\r\nnow, I want to tell you this, I am used as a scapegoat, and there is no\r\ngreater weapon that you can use to create some falsehood about some of\r\nthe Jewish faith, especially at the terrible heinous crime such as the\r\nkilling of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nNow maybe something can be saved. It may not be too late, whatever\r\nhappens, if our President, Lyndon Johnson, knew the truth from me.\r\n\r\nBut if I am eliminated, there won't be any way of knowing.\r\n\r\nRight now, when I leave your presence now. I am the only one that can\r\nbring out the truth to our President, who believes in righteousness and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBut he has been told, I am certain, that I was part of a plot to\r\nassassinate the President.\r\n\r\nI know your hands are tied; you are helpless.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby. I think I can say this to you, that if\r\nhe has been told any such thing, there is no indication of any kind\r\nthat he believes it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I am sorry. Chief Justice Warren. I thought I would be very\r\neffective in telling you what I have said here. But in all fairness to\r\neveryone, maybe all I want to do is beg that if they found out I was\r\ntelling the truth, maybe they can succeed in what their motives are,\r\nbut maybe my people won't be tortured and mutilated.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, you may be sure that the President and his\r\nwhole Commission will do anything that is necessary to see that your\r\npeople are not tortured.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You may be sure of that.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No; the only way you can do it is if he knows the truth, that\r\nI am telling the truth, and why I was down in that basement Sunday\r\nmorning, and maybe some sense of decency will come out and they can\r\nstill fulfill their plan, as I stated before, without my people going\r\nthrough torture and mutilation.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. The President will know everything that you have\r\nsaid, everything that you have said.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But I won't be around, Chief Justice. I won't be around to\r\nverify these things you are going to tell the President.\r\n\r\nMr. TONAHILL. Who do you think is going to eliminate you, Jack?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I have been used for a purpose, and there will be a certain\r\ntragic occurrence happening if you don't take my testimony and somehow\r\nvindicate me so my people don't suffer because of what I have done.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. But we have taken your testimony. We have it\r\nhere. It will be in permanent form for the President of the United\r\nStates and for the Congress of the United States, and for the courts of\r\nthe United States, and for the people of the entire world.\r\n\r\nIt is there. It will be recorded for all to see. That is the purpose of\r\nour coming here today. We feel that you are entitled to have your story\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You have lost me though. You have lost me, Chief Justice\r\nWarren.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Lost you in what sense?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I won't be around for you to come and question me again.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, it is very hard for me to believe that. I\r\nam sure that everybody would want to protect you to the very limit.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nBecause as it stands now--and the truth serum, and any\r\nother--Pentothal--how do you pronounce it, whatever it is. And they\r\nwill not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd then I want to leave this world. But I don't want my people to be\r\nblamed for something that is untrue, that they claim has happened.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Mr. Ruby, I promise you that you will be able to\r\ntake such a test.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. When?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You will have to let me see when we can figure\r\nthat out. But I assure you, it won't be delayed, because our desire\r\nis to terminate the work of the Commission and make our report to the\r\npublic just as soon as possible, so there won't be any misunderstanding\r\ncaused by all of these rumors or stories that have been put out that\r\nare not consistent with the evidence in the case.\r\n\r\nBut it will not be unnecessarily delayed, and we will do it on behalf\r\nof the Commission, I promise you.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All I want, and I beg you--when are you going to see the\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, I have no date with the President. I don't\r\nknow just when. But as soon as I do see him, I will be glad to tell him\r\nwhat you have said.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All I want is to take a polygraph to tell the truth. That is\r\nall I want to do.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; that, I promise you you can do.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Because my people are going to suffer about things that will\r\nbe said about me.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes; well, I promise.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Hold on another minute.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. How do you know if the facts I stated about everything I\r\nsaid, statements with reference to, are the truth or not?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Well, if you want a test made to test those\r\nprincipal questions, we will work them out so they can be tested.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, you can't use the polygraph to say now this is the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I know that.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. To say you have the story of Jack Ruby. You can't\r\ndo that.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. I know that. You can clarify by questioning me when I\r\nconceived the idea and what my answer would naturally be that Sunday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Maybe I can help the situation this way. Suppose\r\nyou list for us, if you can, the questions that you would like to have\r\nasked of you on the polygraph to establish the truth of your testimony.\r\n\r\nWhat things do you consider vital in it, and what would you like to\r\nhave verified?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Yes; but you are telling me to do these things--these things\r\nare going to be promised, but you see they aren't going to let me do\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nBecause when you leave here, I am finished. My family is finished.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Isn't it true, Mr. Chief Justice, that the same\r\nmaximum protection and security Mr. Ruby has been given in the past\r\nwill be continued?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But now that I have divulged certain information because I\r\nwant to be honest, all I want to take is a polygraph test and tell the\r\ntruth about things and combat the lies that have been told about me.\r\n\r\nNow maybe certain people don't want to know the truth that may come out\r\nof me. Is that plausible?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, the Chief Justice has agreed, and\r\nI on the Commission wholeheartedly concur, that you will be given a\r\npolygraph test as expeditiously as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure you can rely on what has been stated here by the Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. How are we going to communicate and so on?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. We will communicate directly with you.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. You have a lost cause, Earl Warren. You don't stand a chance.\r\nThey feel about you like they do about me, Chief Justice Warren.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't hurt your feelings in telling you that.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. That won't hurt my feelings, because I have had\r\nsome evidence of the feeling that some people have concerning me.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But you are the only one that can save me. I think you can.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. But by delaying minutes, you lose the chance. And all I want\r\nto do is tell the truth, and that is all.\r\n\r\nThere was no conspiracy. But by you telling them what you are going to\r\ndo and how you are going to do it is too late as of this moment.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. You take my word for it and the word of\r\nRepresentative Ford, that we will do this thing at the earliest\r\npossible moment, and that it will be done in time. It will be done in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. Well, you won't ever see me again, I tell you that. And I\r\nhave lost my family.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. No, no; you don't believe me, do you?\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. To be frank with you, I believe that you are not\r\nstating now what is the fact.\r\n\r\nI don't say you don't believe it, but I believe that I will be able to\r\nsee you again and that we will be able to take this test that you are\r\nspeaking of.\r\n\r\nWell, I think we have tired Mr. Ruby. We have had him here for close to\r\n4 hours now, and I am sure our reporter must be equally tired, but we\r\nappreciate your patience and your willingness to testify in this manner\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\nMr. RUBY. All I want to do is tell the truth, and the only way you can\r\nknow it is by the polygraph, as that is the only way you can know it.\r\n\r\nChief Justice WARREN. That we will do for you.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 2:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, June 8, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF HENRY WADE, PATRICK D. DEAN, AND WAGGONER CARR\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:25 a.m., on June 8, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Dr. Alfred Goldberg, historian; Waggoner Carr,\r\nattorney general of Texas, and Charles Murray, observers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF HENRY WADE\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Will you raise your hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I do.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You are informed about the purposes of this\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I know it, generally.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you desire a lawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Wade, we are going to ask you generally about the time\r\nof Mr. Oswald's, Lee Harvey Oswald's, arrest, what you had to do in\r\nconnection with the entire matter, and the press being there at the\r\njail, and the scene and seeing what happened there, and the various\r\nthings in regard to Mr. Dean and other witnesses in connection with the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWill you state your name?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Henry Wade.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I am district attorney, or criminal district attorney of\r\nDallas, Tex.; my home is in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us briefly your qualifications for your\r\nposition and profession?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I am a graduate of the University of Texas Law School,\r\n1938, with highest honors. I was county attorney at Rock Wall, Tex.,\r\nanother county for 1 year. I resigned on December 4, 1939, and became\r\na special agent of the FBI. As a special agent of the FBI--I was there\r\nuntil August of 1943, these were rough months--when I resigned and\r\nbecame an apprentice seaman in the Navy.\r\n\r\nLater I became a lieutenant, junior grade, served in the Pacific 2\r\nyears, about 2 years.\r\n\r\nThen after the war I got out of the Navy on the 6th of February 1946,\r\nran for district attorney in Dallas and was not elected at that\r\ntime. I hadn't ever lived in Dallas prior to that. You see there was\r\nanother county. I was assistant district attorney and then was Federal\r\nprosecutor from January 1, 1947, up until December 1949, when I\r\nresigned and ran for district attorney.\r\n\r\nI was elected district attorney in 1950 and have been criminal district\r\nattorney of Dallas County since January 1, 1951.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you handled many of the prosecutions of that county\r\nsince that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, my office or I have handled all of them since that\r\ntime. I have had quite a bit of experience myself. I have a staff of\r\n41 lawyers and, of course, I don't try all the cases but I have tried\r\nquite a few, I would say 40, 50 anyhow since I have been district\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any particular policy about which cases you\r\nwould try generally?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, it varies according to who my first assistant has been.\r\nIt is varied. If I have a first assistant who likes to try cases, I\r\nusually let him try a lot and I do the administrative. At the present\r\ntime I have a very fine administrative assistant, Jim Bowie, whom you\r\nmet and I try a few more cases.\r\n\r\nI guess I have tried four in the last year probably but two to five a\r\nyear are about all the cases I try myself personally.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any policy about capital cases as to whether\r\nyou should try them or somebody else?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't try all of them. I try all the cases that are very\r\naggravated and receive probably some publicity to some extent, and\r\nI don't try all the capital cases. I think we have had quite a few\r\ndeath penalties but I don't imagine I have been in over half of them,\r\nprobably half of them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember where you were at the time you learned of\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, they were having a party for President Kennedy at\r\nMarket Hall and I was out at Market Hall waiting for the President to\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you learn about the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, one of the reporters for one of the newspapers told\r\nme there had been a shooting or something, of course, one of those\r\nthings we were getting all kinds of rumors spreading through a crowd\r\nof 3,000-5,000 people, and then they got the radio on and the first\r\nreport was they had killed two Secret Service agents, that was on the\r\nradio, and then the press all came running in there and then ran out,\r\nno one knew for sure what was going on until finally they announced\r\nthat President had been shot and from the rostrum there the chairman of\r\nthe----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was the chairman of that meeting, do you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Eric Johnson. Eric Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was he mayor then?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; he wasn't mayor, he was the president of Texas Industries\r\nand I believe was president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. I may\r\nhave been wrong on that but he has been president of the chamber\r\nof commerce. He is president of Texas Industries, and this is not\r\nparticularly important but he is--that was sort of a bipartisan deal,\r\nin that he is one of the leading Republicans of Dallas and he was\r\nchairman of the meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you do after you heard of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, the first thing, we were set up in a bus to go from\r\nthere to Austin to another party that night for President Kennedy, a\r\ngroup of us, 30 or 40. We got on a bus and went. I went back to the\r\noffice and sent my wife home, my wife was with me.\r\n\r\nAnd the first thing that I did was go check the law to see whether it\r\nwas a Federal offense or mine. I thought it was a Federal offense when\r\nI first heard about it. We checked the law, and were satisfied that was\r\nno serious Federal offense, or not a capital case, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThere might be some lesser offense. I talked to the U.S. attorney.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Barefoot Sanders and he was in agreement it was going to be\r\nour case rather than his and he had been doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did you talk to him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. On the telephone as I recall, in his office from my office. I\r\nam not even sure I talked with him, somebody from my office talked to\r\nhim, because I think you can realize things were a little confused and\r\nthat took us, say, until 3:30 or 4.\r\n\r\nI let everybody in the office go home, but some of my key personnel who\r\nstayed there. I let the girls or told them they could go home, because\r\nthey did close all the offices down there. The next thing I did--do you\r\nwant me to tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I will tell you what I can.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I did was to go by the sheriff's office who is next door\r\nto me and talked to Decker, who is the sheriff. Bill Decker, and they\r\nwere interviewing witnesses who were on the streets at the time, and I\r\nasked him and he said they have got a good prospect.\r\n\r\nThis must have been 3 o'clock roughly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The witnesses that were on the street near the Depository\r\nBuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; and in the building, I am not sure who they were,\r\nthey had two court reporters there taking statements.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did they tell you anything about a suspect at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The Sheriff told me, he said, \"Don't say nothing about it,\r\nbut they have got a good suspect,\" talking about the Dallas Police.\r\n\r\nHe didn't have him there. John Connally, you know, was shot also--and\r\nhe was, he used to be a roommate of mine in the Navy and we were good\r\nfriends, and are now--and the first thing I did then was went out to\r\nthe hospital to see how he was getting along.\r\n\r\nI must have stayed out there until about 5 o'clock, and in case you all\r\ndon't know or understand one thing, it has never been my policy to make\r\nany investigations out of my office of murders or anything else for\r\nthat matter. We leave that entirely to the police agency.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have a reason for that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That is the way it is set up down there. We have more than we\r\ncan do actually in trying the cases. The only time we investigate them\r\nis after they are filed on, indicted, and then we have investigators\r\nwho get them ready for trial and then lawyers.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you any personnel for that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I have in my office 11 investigators but that is\r\njust 1 for each court, and they primarily, or at least about all they\r\ndo is line up the witnesses for trial and help with jury picking and\r\nthings of that kind.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At this point that you are describing, had you learned of\r\nany arrest?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; Mr. Decker says they have a good suspect. He said\r\nthat sometime around 3 o'clock. You see, I didn't have the benefit of\r\nall that was on the air. I didn't even know Oswald had been arrested at\r\nthis time. As a matter of fact, I didn't know it at 5 o'clock when I\r\nleft the hospital.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the hospital, I went home, watched television a while, had\r\ndinner, and a couple, some friends of ours came over there. They were\r\ngoing to Austin with us on the bus, and we had dinner and started out\r\nsomewhere but I said we had better go by the police station.\r\n\r\nAt that time they kept announcing they had Oswald or I believe they\r\nnamed a name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had you learned about the Tippit murder yet?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; of course, it had been on the air that Tippit had\r\nbeen killed.\r\n\r\nI went by the Dallas police, just to let us see what was kind of going\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that unusual for you to do that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It was unusual because I hadn't been in the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, I won't be there on the average of once a year actually, I\r\nmean on anything. I went by there and I went to Chief Curry's office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you happen to do that this time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of course, this is not really, this was not an ordinary case,\r\nthis was a little bit different, and I mostly wanted to know how he was\r\ncoming along on the investigation is the main reason I went by.\r\n\r\nAs I went in, and this is roughly 6:30, 7 at night--I said we ate\r\ndinner at home, I believe the couple were out in the car with my wife\r\nwere waiting for me to go to dinner with them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you go down to the airfield when President Johnson left?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You did not.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I didn't go anywhere but to my office, then to Parkland\r\nHospital and then home, and then I was there a while and then I went by\r\nthe police station, mostly to see how they were coming along. Papers\r\nwere announcing, the radios, I mean, were announcing, television, that\r\nthey had a suspect and was even telling them what some of the evidence\r\nwas against him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time was this at the police station?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I would say around 7 o'clock. This can vary 30 minutes either\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who did you see there?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Chief Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you talk to him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I talked to him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to him and what did he say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, it is hard to remember. I know the first thing he did\r\nwas pull out a memorandum that you all were interested in, signed by\r\nJack Revill, and showed it to me and I read it, and said, \"What do you\r\nthink about that?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if you would identify this for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. You can get it. Let me tell you the story. I read that thing\r\nthere hurriedly and I remember it mentioned that Agent Hosty had talked\r\nto Revill----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Hosty.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you identify him as to what he does?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He is a special agent of the FBI, but I don't think I would\r\nknow him if he walked in here actually.\r\n\r\nBut that is his business. He showed me that, and I read it. Now, as far\r\nas identifying it, I have seen--I have a copy of it in my files.\r\n\r\nYou see, when they turned the records over to me and I read it and\r\nlooked it over and to the best of my knowledge was the same memorandum\r\nhe showed me, although all I did was glance at it and it said generally\r\nthey knew something about him and knew he was in town or something like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who said that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. This memorandum said that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who is reported to be quoting the memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Special Agent Hosty. Now, I have since looked at the\r\nmemorandum. So far as I know it is the same memorandum, but like I\r\nsay I read it there and I don't know whether it is the--I don't know\r\nwhether it said word for word to be the same thing but it appears to me\r\nto my best knowledge to be the same memorandum.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know when you first got the memorandum in your files\r\nthat you are referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It was a month later. You see the police gave me a record of\r\neverything on the Ruby case, I would say some time about Christmas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 709 and ask you if\r\nthat is the memorandum you just referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; to the best of my knowledge that is the memorandum he\r\nshowed me there at 7 p.m. on the 22d day of November 1963.\r\n\r\nJack Revill incidentally, you all have talked with him, but he is one\r\nof the brightest, to my mind, of the young Dallas police officers.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, when we got into the Ruby trial, I asked that they\r\nassign Jack Revill to assist us in the investigation and he assisted\r\nwith picking of the jury and getting the witnesses all through the Ruby\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would your records show when you received a copy of this\r\ndocument, Commission Exhibit No. 709?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I am sure it would. It would be the day--you can trace\r\nit back to when the newspapers said he had turned all the files over to\r\nme and it was around Christmas as I recall, and I believe actually it\r\nwas after Christmas, but probably 30 days, but you see they turned over\r\na file that thick to me, I imagine. It was of all of that, the same\r\nthing they turned over to you, everything the police had on Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You put a receipt stamp on anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think it will show a date or anything like that on it\r\nbecause they just hauled it in there and laid it on my desk. But this\r\nwas--it is in our files, and I am rather sure it is the same time. You\r\nall got the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We didn't receive anything like that until the time that\r\nChief Curry came to testify, just for your information.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I didn't know that, but now on this, this is the Ruby\r\nmatter----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just to refresh my recollection of your testimony, did you\r\nsee this that afternoon around 5 or 6 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Around 7 o'clock I would say it was on Chief Curry's desk.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Of the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of the 22d.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I don't want to interrupt too much, but looking at\r\nthis exhibit, I note it is written, you have seen this Commission,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 709 signed by Jack Revill?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; let me see it; yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is your recollection, was the memorandum that was shown\r\nto you by--first, who did show you the memorandum on the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Chief Curry of the Dallas police.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was the memorandum shown to you on the 22d by Chief\r\nCurry in this same form?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. To the best of my knowledge that was it now.\r\n\r\nNow, like I said I read this memorandum, and I read the memorandum, and\r\nasked the chief what he was going to do with it and he said, \"I don't\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the next morning I heard on television Chief Curry, I don't\r\nknow whether I heard him or not, he made some kind of statement\r\nconcerning this memorandum on television, and then later came back and\r\nsaid that wasn't to his personal knowledge, and I think that was--he\r\nsaid that what he said about it he retracted it to some extent but I\r\nguess you all have got records of those television broadcasts or at\r\nleast can get them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember whether he said just what was in this\r\nExhibit No. 709 or something less than that or more or what?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't remember. You see, things were moving fast, and it is\r\nhard, there are so many things going on. I will go on to my story.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I will answer anything, of course.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You can tell us the rest that you said to Chief Curry and\r\nhe said to you at that time, first.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I asked him how the case was coming along and as a practical\r\nmatter he didn't know. You probably have run into this, but there is\r\nreally a lack of communication between the chief's office and the\r\ncaptain of detective's office there in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You found that to be true.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. For every year I have been in the office down there. And\r\nI assume you have taken their depositions. I don't know what the\r\nrelations--the relations are better between Curry and Fritz than\r\nbetween Hanson and Fritz, who was his predecessor. But Fritz runs a\r\nkind of a one-man operation there where nobody else knows what he is\r\ndoing. Even me, for instance, he is reluctant to tell me, either, but\r\nI don't mean that disparagingly. I will say Captain Fritz is about as\r\ngood a man at solving a crime as I ever saw, to find out who did it\r\nbut he is poorest in the getting evidence that I know, and I am more\r\ninterested in getting evidence, and there is where our major conflict\r\ncomes in.\r\n\r\nI talked to him a minute there and I don't believe I talked to Captain\r\nFritz. One of my assistants was in Fritz's office. I believe I did walk\r\ndown the hall and talk briefly, and they had filed, they had filed on\r\nOswald for killing Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which assistant was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Bill Alexander. There was another one of--another man there,\r\nJim Allen, who was my former first assistant who is practicing law\r\nthere in Dallas and frankly I was a little surprised of seeing him\r\nthere, he is a real capable boy but he was there in homicide with\r\nCaptain Fritz. They were good friends.\r\n\r\nAnd I know there is no question about his intentions and everything\r\nwas good, but he was just a lawyer there, but he had tried many death\r\npenalty cases with Fritz--of Fritz's cases.\r\n\r\nBut he was there. Your FBI was there, your Secret Service were there in\r\nthe homicide.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who from the FBI, do you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I saw Vince Drain, a special agent that I knew,\r\nand Jim Bookhout, I believe, and there was Mr. Kelley and Mr.\r\nSorrels--Inspector Kelley of the Secret Service, Sorrels, Forest\r\nSorrels.\r\n\r\nI might tell you that also, to give you a proper perspective on this\r\nthing, there were probably 300 people then out in that hall.\r\n\r\nYou could hardly walk down the hall. You just had to fight your way\r\ndown through the hall, through the press up there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The television and newsmen. I say 300, that was all that\r\ncould get into that hall and to get into homicide it was a strain to\r\nget the door open hard enough to get into the office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything to Chief Curry about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I probably mentioned it but I assume you\r\nwant--whether I meant he ought to clean them out or not. I didn't tell\r\nhim he should or shouldn't because I have absolutely no control over\r\nthe police. They are a separate entity. They have a municipality, and\r\nthey work under a city manager.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything to Chief Curry about what should be\r\ntold the press about investigation, how it was progressing or anything\r\nof that kind?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; I think that is the brief conversation, that is the last\r\nI talked to Curry that night. I may have talked to--but that is all I\r\nrecall. I left thereafter, and went on out to dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time did you leave?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. 7, 7:30, something like that. I got home, say, 9:30 or 10,\r\nafter eating dinner, and I believe I talked to the U.S. attorney or at\r\nleast I saw it come on the radio that they are going to file on Oswald\r\nas part of an international conspiracy in murdering the U.S. President,\r\nand I think I talked to Barefoot Sanders. He called me or I called him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I wanted to get for the record, Mr. Wade, who would be\r\ntrying to file like that.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know. All I know it wasn't me. It was told to me at\r\none time that the justice of the peace said something about it and\r\nanother one, one of my assistants, Alexander had said something about\r\nit and I have talked to both of them since and both of them deny so I\r\ndon't know who suggested it or anything but it was on the radio and I\r\nthink on television.\r\n\r\nI know I heard it and I am not sure where.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us whether it was from your office or from a\r\nFederal office that such an idea was developing as far as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, on that score it doesn't make any sense at all to me\r\nbecause there is no such crime in Texas, being part of an international\r\nconspiracy, it is just murder with malice in Texas, and if you allege\r\nanything else in an indictment you have to prove it and it is all\r\nsurplusage in an indictment to allege anything, whether a man is a John\r\nBircher or a Communist or anything, if you allege it you have to prove\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo, when I heard it I went down to the police station and took the\r\ncharge on him, just a case of simple murder.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that of Tippit or of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; of the President, and the radio announced Johnston was\r\ndown there, and Alexander, and of course other things, and so I saw\r\nimmediately that if somebody was going to take a complaint that he\r\nis part of an international conspiracy it had to be a publicity deal\r\nrather--somebody was interested in something other than the law because\r\nthere is no such charge in Texas as part of--I don't care what you\r\nbelong to, you don't have to allege that in an indictment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you mean by the radio saying that Johnson was\r\nthere? Do you mean President Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; that is the justice of the peace whose name is Johnston.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston was the justice\r\nof the peace there.\r\n\r\nSo, I went down there not knowing--also at that time I had a lengthy\r\nconversation with Captain Fritz and with Jim Alexander who was in the\r\noffice, Bill Alexander, Bookhout because another reason I thought maybe\r\nthey were going to want to file without the evidence, and then that put\r\neverything on me, you know.\r\n\r\nIf they didn't have the evidence and they said, \"We file on him, we\r\nhave got the assassin\" I was afraid somebody might take the complaint\r\nand I went down to be sure they had some evidence on him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you told us all that you said to the U.S. attorney\r\nwhen you talked to him at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. So far as I know. I know that concerned that point, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well, did he say anything to you about that point?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I think he asked me was that--I don't think Barefoot\r\nwas real conversant, I guess is the word with what the law is in a\r\nmurder charge.\r\n\r\nI told him that it had no place in it and he said he had heard it on\r\nthe radio and didn't know whether it would be--thought it might because\r\nsome--if it was not necessary, he did not think it ought to be done,\r\nsomething to that effect so I went down there to be sure they didn't.\r\n\r\nI went over the evidence which they--when I saw the evidence, it was\r\nthe evidence as told to me by Captain Fritz.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This conversation you have described you had when Jim\r\nAlexander was there and the others?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; I first asked Jim Allen, a man whom I have a lot of\r\nconfidence in, do they have a case and he said it looks like a case,\r\nyou can try.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the case about the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; we are talking entirely about the assassination.\r\n\r\nOn the Tippit thing, I didn't take the charge on that and I think they\r\nhad some witnesses who had identified him there at the scene, but I was\r\nmore worried about the assassination of them filing on somebody that we\r\ncouldn't prove was guilty.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss the evidence that they did have at that\r\ntime with Captain Fritz?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us what evidence you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I have made no notes but roughly he gave the story about him\r\nbringing the gun to work, saying it was window rods from the neighbor,\r\nsomeone who had brought him to work. He also said there were three\r\nemployees of the company that left him on the sixth floor. He told\r\nabout, the part about, the young officer running in there right after\r\nthe assassination and Oswald leaving after the manager said that he was\r\nemployed there. Told about his arrest and said that there was a scuffle\r\nthere, and that he tried to shoot the officer.\r\n\r\nI don't know--I think I am giving you all this because I think a little\r\nof it may vary from the facts but all I know is what Fritz told me.\r\n\r\nHe said the Dallas police had found a palmprint on the underside of the\r\ngun of Oswald. At that time, the FBI was standing by to fly the gun to\r\nthe laboratory here in Washington which incidentally, they didn't find,\r\nbut I assume the Commission has interviewed Senator--not Senator--Day,\r\nthe fingerprint man of the Dallas police but I have learned since that\r\nhe probably can't identify the palmprint under there but at that time\r\nthey told me they had one on it.\r\n\r\nThey said they had a palmprint on the wrapping paper, and on the box, I\r\nbelieve there by the scene. They did at least put Oswald there at the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you clarify the palmprint that you are referring to on\r\nthe rifle?\r\n\r\nWas it on the underside of the rifle, was it between the rifle and the\r\nstock or where was it as you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Specifically, I couldn't say because--but he said they had a\r\npalmprint or a fingerprint of Oswald on the underside of the rifle and\r\nI don't know whether it was on the trigger guard or where it was but I\r\nknew that was important, I mean, to put the gun in his possession.\r\n\r\nI thought we had that all the time when I took the complaint on the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nLet me see what else they had that night. Well, they had a lot of the\r\nthings they found in his possession. They had the map, you know, that\r\nmarked the route of the parade. They had statements from the bus driver\r\nand the taxicab driver that hauled him somewhere.\r\n\r\nI think they varied a little as to where they picked him up but\r\ngenerally they had some type of statement from them.\r\n\r\nThat is generally what they gave me now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all you recall as of that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you give any report to the press then about----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I will tell you what happened then.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. As we walked out of the thing they started yelling, I started\r\nhome, and they started yelling they wanted to see Oswald, the press.\r\n\r\nAnd Perry said that he had put him in the showup room downstairs. Of\r\ncourse, they were yelling all over the world they wanted a picture of\r\nOswald. And I don't know the mob and everybody ended up in the showup\r\nroom. It is three floors below there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Still Friday night?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I would say around midnight roughly. It would--it could be\r\neither way an hour because I went down there around 11 o'clock, 10:30\r\nor 11, some roughly and I don't know what the time element was but I\r\nwould say around midnight.\r\n\r\nSo, they started interviewing Fritz and Curry, and I started to leave\r\nand Fritz said, \"Well, we will get--\" either Fritz or Curry said, \"We\r\nwill show him up down there,\" he said, \"This is Mr. Wade, the district\r\nattorney.\"\r\n\r\nHe kind of introduced me to the press. I didn't say anything at that\r\ntime but down in the basement they started to put Oswald--I went down\r\nthere with them. They started to put Oswald in the lineup down there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you describe that briefly to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I don't know whether you have seen--it is a room larger\r\nthan this and you have a glass here on this side. Behind that glass\r\nthey have a place out here where they walk prisoners in through there\r\nand you can see through this side but you can't see through that side.\r\nI think that is the way it is set up.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You mean observers can see?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Observers can see, but the defendants or suspects can't see\r\nthrough or at least can't identify.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember who else besides Lee Harvey Oswald was in\r\nthe showup?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I am just telling you about the showup room. Now, they\r\nhad had showups on him but I wasn't there at any of those, but this\r\nwas, the purpose of this, was to let the press see Oswald, if I\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nAnd the police were yelling, \"Everybody wants to see him, wants a\r\npicture of him.\" They started in the screened-in portion and a howl\r\nwent up that you can't take a picture through that screen. Then they\r\nhad a conference with, among some of them, and the next thing I knew\r\nI was just sitting there upon a little, I guess, elevated, you might\r\nsay a speaker's stand, although there were 300 people in the room, you\r\ncouldn't even actually get out, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did they ask you whether they should do this?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think I said yea or nay to the thing so far as I\r\nknow, because it was--and I actually didn't know what they were doing\r\nuntil, the next thing I knew they said they were going to have to bring\r\nhim in there.\r\n\r\nWell, I think I did say, \"You'd better get some officers in here or\r\nsomething for some protection on him.\"\r\n\r\nI thought a little about, and I got a little worried at that stage.\r\n\r\nSo about 12 officers came in and they were standing around Oswald, and\r\nat this time I looked out in the audience and saw a man out there,\r\nlater, who turned out to be Jack Ruby. He was there at that scene.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you happen to pick him out?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I don't know. He had--I had seen the fellow somewhere\r\nbefore, but I didn't know his name, but he had a pad, and the reason I\r\nremember him mostly----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You mean a scratch pad?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He had some kind of scratch pad. The reason I mentioned\r\nhim mostly, I will get into him in a minute and tell you everything\r\nabout him. He was out there about 1 minute, I would say, and they took\r\npictures and everything else and Oswald was here and the cameras were\r\nin a ring around him, and as they left----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Excuse me. Where was Ruby from where you told us where\r\nOswald was?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, he was, I would say, about 12 feet. I am giving a\r\nrough----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you saw him----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. We went all through this at the trial, and it varied on where\r\nRuby was, but when I saw him he was about four rows back in the aisle\r\nseat, standing up in the seat.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were there press men around him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. All kinds of press men around him, and also press men 10 deep\r\nbetween him and Oswald.\r\n\r\nNow, one of their--you mentioned the gun awhile ago--one of their\r\ndefenses in the trial was if he had a gun, he had a gun there, he could\r\nhave killed him if he wanted to. It is the first I heard him say that\r\nhe didn't have a gun that you mentioned awhile ago. So when I got--when\r\nthey got through, they started asking him questions, the press.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Wait a minute. How close were the nearest people in the\r\naudience to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I would say they were that far from him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. How far is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Three feet.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You mean some of the reporters and photographers were\r\nwithin 3 feet of him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They were on the ground, they were on the ground, and they\r\nwere standing on top of each other, and on top of tables, and I assume\r\nin that room there were 250 people. It was just a mob scene.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I believe I have seen the room. Isn't it correct that\r\nat the end where the showup is held that is an elevated platform?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. There is a platform up there where the microphone is.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was he standing up on the platform?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, he was not at the platform.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was he on the floor level?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He was in the floor level in the middle. If I understand,\r\nthat was the first or second time I had ever been in the room.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Were there people around him, surrounding him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. People were on the floor in front of those desks.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But I mean, were they, were people on all sides of him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; they were all in front of him. They were all in front of\r\nhim, and you had a ring of policemen behind him, policemen on all sides\r\nof him. It was just the front where they were, and that is the way I\r\nrecall it, but I knew they had a line of policemen behind him, and the\r\nplace was full of policemen, because they went up and it turns out\r\nlater they got all the police who were on duty that night. They were\r\nplain clothes police, most of them, maybe they had a uniform or two, a\r\nfew of them.\r\n\r\nSo they started----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Excuse me one moment.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can I make a statement? I will have to go to my office\r\nfor a few minutes. I hope to return in about 20 minutes, and I will ask\r\nMr. Dulles to preside in my place, and I will return.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you proceed?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; so they said, \"Have you filed on him?\" At that\r\nstage, started yelling has he been filed on, and I said yes, and\r\nfiled on for murder with malice, and they asked Judge Johnston, is\r\nthere--they asked him something.\r\n\r\nThen they started asking me questions everywhere, from all angles.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Under your practice, what do you mean by file on him? Is\r\nthat something different than an arraignment?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, of course, it is according to the terminology and what\r\nyou mean by arraignment. In Texas the only arraignment is when you get\r\nready to try him. Like we arraigned Ruby just before we started putting\r\non evidence. That is the only arraignment we have, actually.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see. You don't bring him before a magistrate?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, that is called--you can have an examining trial before\r\nthe magistrate to see whether it is a bailable matter. At that time, I\r\ndon't believe he had been brought before the magistrate, because I told\r\nDavid Johnston as we left there, I said, \"You ought to go up before the\r\njail and have him brought before you and advise him of his rights and\r\nhis right to counsel and this and that,\" which, so far as I know, he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut at that meeting you had two attorneys from American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Which meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That Friday night meeting, or Friday night showup we had\r\nbetter call it, midnight on Friday night. I believe it was Greer Ragio\r\nand Professor Webster from SMU. I saw them there in the hall, and Chief\r\nCurry told me that they had been given an opportunity or had talked\r\nwith Oswald. I am not sure. I was under the impression that they had\r\ntalked with them but, of course, I didn't see them talking with him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you talk to them about it?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; I told them that he is entitled to counsel, that is what\r\nthey are interested in on the counsel situation, and anybody, either\r\nthem or anybody else could see him that wanted to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did they say then?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Mr. Rankin, I will tell you what, there was so much going on\r\nI don't remember exactly. The only thing was I got the impression they\r\nhad already talked with them somewhere, but I don't know whether they\r\ntold me or the chief told me or what. Like I say, it was a mob scene\r\nthere, practically, and they were standing in the door when I--they\r\nwere in the meeting there.\r\n\r\nLet me get a little further and go back to--I don't know whether I\r\nanswered your question and if I don't it is because I can't, because I\r\ndon't know--I will tell you what happened the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Let's finish with the showup now.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes. They asked a bunch of questions there. I think if\r\nyou get a record of my interview that you will find that any of the\r\nevidence----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which interview is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. With the press, midnight, radio, television, and everything\r\nelse. I think if you will get a copy of that you will find they asked\r\nme lots of questions about fingerprints and evidence. I refused to\r\nanswer them because I said it was evidence in the case. The only thing\r\nthat I told them that you might get the impression was evidence but is\r\nreally not evidence, I told them that the man's wife said the man had\r\na gun or something to that effect. The reason, maybe good or bad, but\r\nthat isn't admissible in Texas. You see a wife can't testify. It is not\r\nevidence, but it is evidence but it is inadmissible evidence actually\r\nis what it was. So I think if you find anything in that interview that\r\ndeals with the evidence you are going to feel that it dealt only with\r\nthat piece of testimony of Marina Oswald, which someone had told me she\r\nsaid about the gun was missing from the house, which I think later was\r\ncorroborated.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At that time, had you filed on the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; we had filed upstairs prior to this. He had been\r\nfiled on for murder with malice.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But he hadn't been brought before the justice of the peace\r\nor magistrate yet on that complaint, had he?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The justice of the peace was there in the office and took it\r\nin the homicide. Oswald was in homicide, also, but he is in a separate\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nLike I told you, I never did see Oswald except in that lineup\r\ndownstairs. That was the first time I had seen him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that when you told the justice of the peace that he\r\nought to have him before him to tell him his rights and so forth?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; it was some time during that hour, this went on for\r\nabout an hour down there, everything.\r\n\r\nWell, during that interview somebody said, and the thing--Oswald\r\nbelonged to, was he a Communist, something generally to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. They asked you that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I was asked that. And I said, well, now, I don't know about\r\nthat but they found some literature, I understand, some literature\r\ndealing with Free Cuba Movement. Following this--and so I looked up and\r\nJack Ruby is in the audience and he said, no, it is the Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee. Well, he corrected me, you see, to show you why I got\r\nattracted to his attention, why someone in the audience would speak up\r\nand answer a question.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You hadn't known him before?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I had never known him, to my knowledge. He is a man about\r\ntown, and I had seen him before, because when I saw him in there, and I\r\nactually thought he was a part of the press corps at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were any of your assistants or people working for you there\r\nat that showup?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't believe there were any of them there now. If there is\r\nany of them, it is Alexander, because he is the only one down there,\r\nbut I think he is still up in homicide.\r\n\r\nI will go further on that, some of my assistants know him, but he was\r\nin my office 2 days before this with a hot check or something where he\r\nwas trying to collect a hot check or pay someone. I think he was trying\r\nto pay someone else's hot check off, I don't know what it was, I didn't\r\nsee him. He talked to my check section. I found this out later.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By \"he\" you mean----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Ruby, Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He was in another office of mine, since this all came out,\r\nhe was in there with a bunch of the police, we were trying a case on\r\npornography, some of my assistants were, and my assistant came in his\r\noffice during the noon hour after coming from the court, this was 2\r\nor 3 days before the assassination and Ruby was sitting there in his\r\noffice with five or six Dallas police officers. In fact, he was sitting\r\nin my assistant's desk and he started to sit down and asked who he was\r\nand the officer said, \"Well, that is Jacky Ruby who runs the Carousel\r\nClub,\" so he had been down there.\r\n\r\nI don't know him personally--I mean I didn't know who he was. It was\r\none of these things I had seen the man, I imagine, but I had no idea\r\nwho he was, and I will even go further, after it was over, this didn't\r\ncome out in the trial, as they left down there, Ruby ran up to me and\r\nhe said, \"Hi Henry\" he yelled real loud, he yelled. \"Hi, Henry,\" and\r\nput his hand to shake hands with me and I shook hands with him. And\r\nhe said, \"Don't you know me?\" And I am trying to figure out whether I\r\ndid or not. And he said, \"I am Jack Ruby, I run the Vegas Club.\" And\r\nI said, \"What are you doing in here?\" It was in the basement of the\r\ncity hall. He said, \"I know all these fellows.\" Just shook his hand and\r\nsaid, \"I know all these fellows.\" I still didn't know whether he was\r\ntalking about the press or police all the time, but he shook his hands\r\nkind of like that and left me and I was trying to get out of the place\r\nwhich was rather crowded, and if you are familiar with that basement,\r\nand I was trying to get out of that hall. And here I heard someone\r\ncall \"Henry Wade wanted on the phone,\" this was about 1 o'clock in the\r\nmorning or about 1 o'clock in the morning, and I gradually get around\r\nto the phone there, one of the police phones, and as I get there it is\r\nJack Ruby, and station KLIF in Dallas on the phone. You see, he had\r\ngone there, this came out in the trial, that he had gone over there\r\nand called KLIF and said Henry Wade is down there, I will get you an\r\ninterview with him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who is this?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. KLIF is the name of the radio station.\r\n\r\nYou see, I didn't know a thing, and I just picked up the phone and they\r\nsaid this is so and so at KLIF and started asking questions.\r\n\r\nBut that came out in the trial.\r\n\r\nBut to show that he was trying to be kind of the type of person who was\r\nwanting to think he was important, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you give him an interview over the telephone to KLIF?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I answered about two questions and hung up, but they had\r\na man down there who later interviewed me before I got out of the\r\nbuilding. But they just asked me had he been filed and one or two\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was a KLIF reporter that you gave this to, not Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Not Ruby. Ruby was not on the phone, he had just gone out\r\nand called him and handed the phone to me. I thought I got a call from\r\nsomebody, and picked it up and it was KLIF on the phone.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. On the pornography charge, was Ruby involved in that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I don't know why he was down there, actually. But\r\nthere were six or seven police officers, special services of the Dallas\r\npolice were officers in the thing and I don't know whether he was\r\njust interested in it or what he was down there for but he was down\r\nthere, and I didn't know him. He has tried to leave the impression\r\nthat he had known me a long time but it is one of those things, I have\r\nbeen in politics and sometimes there are a lot of faces I know that I\r\ndon't know actually who they are, but I didn't know who he was and he\r\nactually introduced himself to me that night.\r\n\r\nWell, that is about all I can recall of that night.\r\n\r\nI went home then.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have told us all you remember about the showup?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I told you all, and, of course, all I know about it as far as\r\nmy interview with the press. You can get more accurate, actually, by\r\ngetting a transcript of it because I don't remember what all was asked,\r\nbut I do remember the incident with Ruby and I know I told them that\r\nthere would be no evidence given out in the case.\r\n\r\nAt that time, most of it had already been given out, however, by\r\nsomeone. I think by the police.\r\n\r\nNow, the next morning, I don't know of anything else until the next\r\nmorning. I went to the office about 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any particular transcript that you are speaking\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I don't have anything. The thing about it is this was\r\ntaken, this was on television and radio and all the networks. They had\r\neverything there set up and that is the only--that is the first of, I\r\nthink, three times I was interviewed, but it was Friday night around\r\nbetween 12 and 1 o'clock. It was actually Saturday morning between 12\r\nand 1.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So there were a number of networks, possibly, and a number\r\nof the radio stations and television stations from the whole area?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The whole area and it actually wasn't set up for an interview\r\nwith me. It was an interview, what I thought, with Fritz and Curry, and\r\nI thought I would stay for it, but when they got into the interviewing,\r\nI don't know what happened to them but they weren't there. They had\r\nleft, or I was the one who was answering the questions about things I\r\ndidn't know much about, to tell you the truth.\r\n\r\nHas that got it cleared? Can I go to the next morning?\r\n\r\nI will try to go a little and not forget anything.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I went to my office, probably, say, 9 o'clock Saturday\r\nmorning. Waiting there for me was Robert Oswald, who was the brother of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald. You probably have met him, but I believe his name is\r\nRobert is his brother.\r\n\r\nI talked to him about an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to him and what did he say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, we discussed the history of Lee Harvey Oswald and\r\nthe--one of the purposes he came to me, he wanted his mother, Oswald's\r\nmother, and wife and him to see Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say this to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; but we had already set it up, somebody, I don't know\r\nwhether my office or the police, but he was set up to see him that\r\nmorning at 11 o'clock, I believe, or 12 o'clock, some time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you do anything about it?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; I checked to see if it was arranged. I called\r\nCaptain Fritz and told him that he wanted to see him, and he said they\r\nwere going to let him see him. I don't know. I don't know the name, but\r\nit was either 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether he had requested or not, but that was the first\r\ntime I had seen him. I don't know why he came to my office, but I used\r\nit to try to go into Lee Harvey Oswald's background some, and I also\r\ntold him that there is a lot involved in this thing from a national\r\npoint of view, and I said, \"You appear to be a good citizen,\" which\r\nhe did appear to me, \"and I think you will render your country a\r\ngreat service if you will go up and tell Oswald to tell us all about\r\nthe thing.\" That was part of the deal of my working for a statement\r\nfrom Oswald which didn't pan out, of course. Because I was going to\r\ninterview Oswald Sunday afternoon when we got him into the county jail\r\nand I was going to attempt to get a statement from him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did Robert tell you anything about Lee Harvey Oswald's\r\nbackground at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He told me about in Europe, how in Russia, how they had had\r\nvery little correspondence with them and he wrote to them renouncing or\r\ntelling them he wanted to renounce his American citizenship and didn't\r\nwant to have anything else to do with him. He said later that one of\r\nthe letters changed some, I mean back, and then he said he was coming\r\nhome, coming back and he had married and kind of his general history\r\nof the thing and he came back and I believe stayed with this Robert in\r\nFort Worth for 2, 3, or 4 months. Now I say this is from memory, like\r\nI don't have--and they had helped him some, and said that Marina, the\r\nthing that impressed her was most your supermarkets, I think, more than\r\nanything else in this country, your A. & P. and the big, I guess you\r\ncall them, supermarkets or whatever they are.\r\n\r\nAnd he told me something about him going to New Orleans, but I gathered\r\nthat they were not too close. I believe he told me this, that he hadn't\r\nseen him in close to a year prior to this, or a good while.\r\n\r\nNow, it seemed to me like it was a year, and he said their families,\r\nthey didn't have anything in common much, and he said, of course--I\r\nsaid \"Do you think\"--I said, \"the evidence is pretty strong against\r\nyour brother, what do you think about it?\" He said, \"Well, he is my\r\nbrother, and I hate to think he would do this.\" He said, \"I want to\r\ntalk to him and ask him about it.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I never did see him. Roughly, that is about all I remember from\r\nthat conversation. We rambled around for quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI know I was impressed because he got out and walked out the front\r\nof my office and in front of my office there were 15 or 20 press men\r\nwanting to ask him something, and he wouldn't say a word to them, he\r\njust walked off.\r\n\r\nI told him they would be out there, and he said, \"I won't have anything\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this the morning after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. About what time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I would say between 9 and 10 is when I talked with him.\r\n\r\nAnd so the main purpose in the office, we believed, the main purpose\r\nof me and the lawyers in the office were briefing the law on whether\r\nto try Oswald for the murder of the President, whether you could prove\r\nthe flight and the killing of Officer Tippit, which we became satisfied\r\nthat we could, I mean from an evidentiary point of view.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By \"we\" who do you mean, in your office?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I think I had seven or eight in there, Bowie, and\r\nAlexander, and Dan Ellis, Jim Williamson, but there was a legal point.\r\n\r\nMy office was open, but that, with reference to this case, there were\r\nother things going on, but in reference to this case, this is what we\r\nspent our time trying to establish whether that would be admissible or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you consult with any Federal officers in regard to how\r\nyou should handle the case or what you should say about it at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I didn't discuss, consult with any of them. I did talk to\r\nsome of the FBI boys and I believe there was an inspector.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. There was an inspector of the FBI who called me two or three\r\ntimes. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did they tell you how to handle the case in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think so. I mean it wasn't really up to them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The only time you ever talked to Barefoot Sanders about it\r\nwas in regard to this conspiracy, possibility of, that you have already\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Frankly, that is hard to say. I think we talked off and on\r\nevery day or two about developments in it, because, you see, well, I\r\ndon't know whether we talked any more but before the killing by Ruby,\r\nbut we had nearly a daily conversation about the files in the Oswald\r\ncase, what we were going to do with them. You see, they were going to\r\ngive them all to me, and at that stage we didn't know whether it was\r\ngoing to be a President's Commission or a congressional investigation\r\nor what. After the President's Commission was set up, I arranged\r\nthrough him and Miller here in the Justice Department that rather than\r\ngive the files to me, to get the police to turn them over to the FBI\r\nand send them to you all, or photostat them and send them to you all.\r\n\r\nBarefoot and I talked frequently, but I don't know of anything\r\nsignificant of the Oswald angle that we discussed, and we spent the\r\nlast 2 months trying to get some of the FBI files to read on the Ruby\r\ntrial. I mean we talked a lot but I don't know anything further about\r\nOswald into it or anything on Ruby of any particular significance.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was Barefoot Sanders suggesting how you should handle the\r\nOswald case except the time you already related?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't recall him doing, suggesting that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Any other Federal officers suggesting anything like that to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The only thing I remember is the inspector of the FBI whom I\r\ndon't think I ever met. I was there in the police one time during this\r\nshuffle, and I think it was some time Saturday morning, and he said\r\nthey should have nothing, no publicity on the thing, no statements.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't know whether that was after Ruby shot Oswald or before, I\r\ndon't know when it was, but I did talk with him and I know his concern\r\nwhich was that there was too much publicity.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And he told you that, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. At some stage in it. I am thinking it was Sunday night which\r\nI know I talked with him Sunday night, but we are not that far along\r\nwith it yet. But I don't know whether I talked to him previously or not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is the only conversation of that type that you recall\r\nwith any Federal officer?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That is all I recall. I am sure Barefoot and I discussed the\r\npublicity angle on it some, but I don't remember Barefoot suggesting\r\nhow we handle it, but neither one of us knew whether it was his offense\r\nor mine, to begin with, for 2 or 3 hours because we had to select it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know what Barefoot said about publicity when you did\r\ndiscuss it with him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't recall anything.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All right.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next, as you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I was going home. I went by the police station to talk to\r\nChief Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss the evidence then?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, at that time--you see, Chief Curry knew very little of\r\nthe evidence at that stage. He should have known, but he didn't. But I\r\ndiscussed the thing with him and I told him there was too much evidence\r\nbeing put out in the case from his department, that I wish he would\r\ntalk to Fritz and have no further statements on it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He said, \"That is fine. I think that is so.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, going back just a moment, you spoke out about a map\r\nearlier that you had been told they had as evidence, do you recall, of\r\nthe parade route. Did you look at the map at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think I ever saw the map.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You don't know what it contained in regard to the parade\r\nroute?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I was told by Fritz that it had the parade route and it had\r\nan X where the assassination took place and it had an X out on Stemmons\r\nFreeway and an X at Inwood Road and Lemon, is all I know, a circle or\r\nsome mark there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But you have never seen the map?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. So far as I know, I have never seen the map. I don't know\r\neven where it was found, but I think it was found in his home,\r\nprobably. But that is my recollection. But I don't even know that. I\r\ntold Chief Curry this.\r\n\r\nThen I walked out, and Tom Pettit of NBC said, \"We are all confused on\r\nthe law, where we are really on this thing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. At that time I said, \"Well, I will explain the procedure,\r\nTexas procedure in a criminal case,\" and I had about a 10-minute\r\ninterview there as I was leaving the chief's office, dealing entirely\r\nwith the procedure, I mean your examining trial and grand jury and jury\r\ntrial. I mean as to what takes place. You see, they had all kinds of\r\nstatements and other countries represented and they were all curious to\r\nask legal questions, when bond would be set and when it would be done.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss the evidence at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I refused. You will find that I refused to answer\r\nquestions. They all asked questions on it, but I would tell them that\r\nis evidence and that deals with evidence in the matter.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you tell them why you wouldn't answer those questions?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I told them we had to try the case, here, and we would have\r\nto try the case and we wouldn't be able to get a jury if they knew all\r\nthe evidence in the case.\r\n\r\nYou will find that in those interviews most, I think. I haven't seen\r\nthem. As a matter of fact, didn't see them myself even. But I went home\r\nthat day, and----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That day is Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Saturday; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About what time? Do you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I guess I got home 2:30 probably. I must have eaten on the\r\nway home or somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In the afternoon?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; and I know I was amazed as I walked through the\r\ntelevision room there and saw Chief Curry with that gun. You see,\r\nat that time they had not identified the gun as his gun, but he was\r\ntelling about the FBI report on it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you just describe what you saw there at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I know he was in a crowd, and it seems to me like\r\nhe had the gun, but on second thought I am not even sure whether he\r\nhad the gun, but he was tracing the history of how that the gun was\r\nbought under the name, under an assumed name from a mail-order house\r\nin Chicago and mailed there to Dallas, and that the serial number\r\nand everything that had been identified, that the FBI had done that,\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nI believe they said they had a post office box here, a blind post\r\noffice box that the recipients of that had identified as Oswald as the\r\nguy or something that received it.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he went directly over the evidence connecting him with\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You say there was a crowd there. Who was the crowd around\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Newsmen. You see, I was at home. I was watching it on\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see. Did you do anything about that, then? Did you call\r\nhim and ask him to quit that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I felt like nearly it was a hopeless case. I know now why\r\nit happened. That was the first piece of evidence he got his hands on\r\nbefore Fritz did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you explain what you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, this went to the FBI and came to him rather than to\r\nCaptain Fritz, and I feel in my own mind that this was something new,\r\nthat he really had been receiving none of the original evidence, that\r\nit was coming through Fritz to him and so this went from him to Fritz,\r\nyou know, and I think that is the reason he did it.\r\n\r\nSo I stayed home that afternoon. I was trying to think, it seems like I\r\nwent back by the police station some time that night, late at night.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This way of giving evidence to the press and all of the\r\nnews media, is that standard practice in your area?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; it is, unfortunately. I don't think it is good. We have\r\njust, even since this happened we have had a similar incident with the\r\npolice giving all the evidence out or giving out an oral confession of\r\na defendant that is not admissible in court. You know, oral admissions\r\nare not generally admissible in Texas. And they gave all the evidence\r\nout in it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you done anything about it, tried to stop it in any\r\nway?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, in this actually, in the same story they quoted me as\r\nsaying, I mean the news quoted me as saying they shouldn't give the\r\ninformation out, that is the evidence, we have got to try the case,\r\nwe will get a jury, it is improper to do this, or something to that\r\neffect. So far as taking it up with--I have mentioned many times that\r\nthey shouldn't give out evidence, in talking to the police officers, I\r\nmean in there in training things, but it is something I have no control\r\nover whatever. It is a separate entity, the city of Dallas is, and I\r\ndo a little fussing with the police, but by the same token it is not\r\na situation where--I think it is one of your major problems that are\r\ngoing to have to be looked into not only here but it is a sidelight, I\r\nthink, to your investigation to some extent, but I think you prejudice\r\nus, the state, more than you do the defense by giving out our testimony.\r\n\r\nYou may think that giving out will help you to convict him. I think it\r\nworks the other way, your jurors that read, the good type of jurors,\r\nget an opinion one way or another from what they read, and you end\r\nup with poor jurors. If they haven't read or heard anything of the\r\ncase--well, not generally the same type of juror.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I make a practice of saying is that I reviewed the\r\nevidence in this case in which the State will ask the death penalty,\r\nwhich may be going too far, but I tell them we plan to ask the death\r\npenalty or plan to ask life or plan to ask maximum jail sentence or\r\nsomething of that kind.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say that at any time about the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Oh, yes, sir; I have said that about both Oswald and Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When did you say it about the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I guess it was Friday night probably. I was asked what\r\npenalty we would ask for.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When the police made these releases about the evidence, did\r\nthey ever ask you whether they should make them?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; like I told you. I talked Saturday morning around\r\nbetween 11 and 12, some time. I told him there was entirely too much\r\npublicity on this thing, that with the pressure going to be on us to\r\ntry it and there may not be a place in the United States you can try\r\nit with all the publicity you are getting. Chief Curry said he agreed\r\nwith me, but, like I said about 2 hours later, I saw him releasing this\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you consult any State officials about how you should\r\nhandle either the Oswald or the Ruby case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know. It seems like I talked to Waggoner Carr that\r\nnight, but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nDidn't we talk some time about it?\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it was consulting about how to try it or anything.\r\nBut I know I talked to Waggoner's office some time within 2 or 3 days,\r\nbut I don't know whether it was before the Ruby assault or not. But he\r\ndoesn't actually----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Does the Texas attorney general have any jurisdiction to\r\ntell you how to try such cases?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No sir; I think Waggoner will agree with that. They don't\r\nhave any jurisdiction to try criminal cases other than antitrust, but\r\nI assume we would ask for their assistance if we wanted it. We don't\r\ngenerally, and I don't, the law doesn't contemplate that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Carr didn't try to tell you in any way how to handle\r\neither case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May we proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Wade, will you give us the substance of what Mr. Carr\r\nsaid to you and what you said to him at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. All I remember--I don't actually remember or know what night\r\nit was I talked to him but I assume it was that night because he did\r\nmention that the rumor was out that we were getting ready to file a\r\ncharge of Oswald being part of an international conspiracy, and I told\r\nhim that that was not going to be done.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night and I believe that is----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It must have been Saturday night, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; that was Friday night.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Friday night.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. And I told him, and then I got a call, since this happened, I\r\ntalked to Jim Bowie, my first assistant who had talked to, somebody had\r\ncalled him, my phone had been busy and Barefoot Sanders, I talked to\r\nhim, and he--they all told that they were concerned about their having\r\nreceived calls from Washington and somewhere else, and I told them\r\nthat there wasn't any such crime in Texas, I didn't know where it came\r\nfrom, and that is what prompted me to go down and take the complaint,\r\notherwise I never would have gone down to the police station.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything about whether you had evidence to\r\nsupport such a complaint of a conspiracy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Mr. Rankin, I don't know what evidence we have, we had at\r\nthat time and actually don't know yet what all the evidence was.\r\n\r\nI never did see, I was told they had a lot of Fair Play for Cuba\r\npropaganda or correspondence on Oswald, and letters from the Communist\r\nParty, and it was probably exaggerated to me.\r\n\r\nI was told this. I have never seen any of that personally. Never saw\r\nany of it that night. But whether he was a Communist or whether he\r\nwasn't, had nothing to do with solving the problem at hand, the filing\r\nof the charge.\r\n\r\nI also was very, I wasn't sure I was going to take a complaint, and a\r\njustice of the peace will take a complaint lots of times because he\r\ndoesn't have to try it. I knew I would have to try this case and that\r\nprompted me to go down and see what kind of evidence they had.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us what you mean by taking a complaint under\r\nyour law.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, a complaint is a blank form that you fill out in the\r\nname, by the authority of the State of Texas, and so forth, which I\r\ndon't have here, but it charged, it charges a certain person with\r\ncommitting a crime, and it is filed in the justice court.\r\n\r\nThe law permits the district attorney or any of his assistants to swear\r\nthe witness to the charge. The only place we sign it is over on the\r\nleft, I believe sworn to and subscribed to before me, this is the blank\r\nday of blank, Henry Wade, district attorney.\r\n\r\nOver on the right the complainant signs the complaint. We mean when we\r\nsay take or accept a complaint is when we swear the witness and we draw\r\nit up ourselves and word it and take it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that what you did in the Oswald-Ruby case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; we did that. Now, as a practical matter that is not\r\nreally filing the complaints. The complaint is not really legally filed\r\nuntil a justice of the peace takes it and records it on his docket.\r\n\r\nNow, it goes to the justice of the peace court to clear the whole thing\r\nup and his purpose, he has--the law says you shall take him immediately\r\nbefore a magistrate, which is the justice of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe courts have held that it is not necessary in Texas, but there\r\nis a statute that says that, and then he--his purpose is to hold an\r\nexamining trial to see whether it is a bailable case or not.\r\n\r\nThen he sends it to the grand jury and the grand jury hears it and\r\nreturns an indictment or a no bill and then it is in a certain court\r\nset with a docket number and then it is ours to try.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer some of the questions?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper returned to the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Which route did you follow in regard to the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The same route. I accepted the complaint on him in the\r\nhomicide department, and gave it to David Johnston, the justice of the\r\npeace who was there incidentally, or there in the homicide department.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't actually type it up. I don't know who actually typed it\r\nup, somebody typed it up, but we file about a 100 a year, murders \"did\r\nwith malice aforethought.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a straight murder indictment, murder with malice charge, and\r\nthat was the procedure we followed in the Oswald case.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why did you not include in that complaint a charge of an\r\ninternational conspiracy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, it is just like I said, it is surplusage to begin with.\r\nYou don't need it. If you allege it you have to prove it. The U.S.\r\nattorney and the attorney general had called me and said that if it\r\nwasn't absolutely necessary they thought it shouldn't be done, and---\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By the \"attorney general\" who do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Mr. Carr. And actually it is never done. I mean, you see\r\nthat got clear, apparently you had the press writing that up, radio or\r\nwhoever was saying that was--had no idea about what murder was.\r\n\r\nNow, to write in there, assume he was, assume we could prove he was,\r\na Communist, which I wasn't able to prove because all I heard was he\r\nhad some literature there on him and had been in Russia, but assume I\r\nknew he was a Communist, can I prove it, I still wouldn't have alleged\r\nit because it is subject actually to be removed from the indictment\r\nbecause it is surplusage, you know, and all a murder indictment, the\r\nonly thing that a murder indictment varies on is the method of what\r\nthey used, did kill John Doe by shooting him with a gun or by stabbing\r\nhim or by drowning him in water or how, the manner and means is the\r\nonly thing that varies in a murder indictment, all other wordage is the\r\nsame. Does that clear that up?\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. As I understand it, under Texas law there is no crime\r\nwhich is denominated under the term \"international conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I assume that conspiracy is a crime in Texas, isn't it,\r\nconspiracy to commit a crime?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Conspiracy is a crime. It is a joining together of a group,\r\nyour conspiracy where they enter into an agreement to commit a crime,\r\nand that is usually the one is indicted as a conspirator, the one who\r\ndoesn't participate in the crime.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. My point is, though, that conspiracy is a crime under\r\nTexas law?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir; conspiracy to commit murder is a crime.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nLet me ask this question.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. As I understand it then, one of the reasons that no\r\nwarrant of indictment was rendered upon, touching upon an international\r\nconspiracy is that there is just no such crime in Texas as an\r\ninternational conspiracy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. There was no such crime. If it was any such crime it would be\r\na Federal rather than a State offense. If there is such crime as being\r\na part of an international conspiracy it would deal with treason rather\r\nthan murder, I would think.\r\n\r\nBut there is no such thing as being a part of any organization that\r\nmakes that it is a crime to commit murder. This was a straight murder\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nIf we would have had four or five co-conspirators who conspired with\r\nhim, planned the thing and could prove it we would have. That would\r\nhave been a conspiracy to, conspiracy to commit murder.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But conspiracy is not essential to the crime, to\r\ndescribe the person accused as belonging to any organization?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; it is not necessary and it is entirely what they\r\ncall surplusage.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now the last question, was there any evidence brought\r\nto you or any evidence of which you had knowledge upon which you could\r\nbase an indictment or a warrant for conspiracy to commit murder in this\r\ncase?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; you mean parties other than Oswald?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No. I might say on that score, to clear that up, I haven't\r\nseen any evidence along that line. I haven't even seen any of the\r\ncorrespondence that they had, allegedly had with the Communist Party\r\nhere in New York or the Fair Play for Cuba, I haven't seen his little\r\nblack book where he is supposed to have had the Russian Embassy's\r\ntelephone numbers in it which I am sure you all have gone into it.\r\n\r\nI never did see the book, none of that.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have been told by a lot of people and undoubtedly a lot of\r\nit was exaggerated that he was a Communist, and you have had people say\r\nhe was a Communist who might say I was a Communist, you know, if they\r\ndidn't agree with me on something, so I have absolutely no evidence\r\nthat he was a Communist of my own knowledge, I have heard a lot, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What you are saying in this last answer relates to the\r\npresent time, not only the way your knowledge has----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. At that time and up to the present.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Rather than the day of assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I have no evidence myself now that he was a Communist, or\r\never was a Communist, and I never did see what evidence that they had\r\non him there gathered on him. I never saw any of the physical evidence\r\nin the Oswald case other than one or two statements, and I think I\r\nsaw the gun while they were taking it out of there bringing it to\r\nWashington, because I told them at that stage, they didn't want to take\r\nit out, didn't want to let the FBI have it and I told them I thought\r\nthey ought to let them bring it on up here that night and get it back\r\nthe next night.\r\n\r\nThere was arguing over that. I am getting off, rambling around, but\r\ntheir argument over that was they were still trying to identify the gun\r\nthrough a pawn broker or something like that and the police wanted to\r\nkeep it but I said, \"Let it go up there and they said they would have\r\nit back the next afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you ever had any evidence that Oswald was involved\r\nwith anyone else in actually shooting the President?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I will answer that the same way. I have absolutely no\r\nevidence myself.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, I might have some type of opinion or some connection\r\nwith reference to the Fair Play for Cuba and these letters that they\r\ntold me about. If that was so there may have been some connection or\r\nmay not, but I have no evidence myself on it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any evidence as to whether Jack Ruby was\r\ninvolved with anyone else in the killing of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I have no evidence on that. We have some and I think\r\nyou have them all, some 8 or 10 witnesses who have said they had seen\r\nRuby and Oswald together at various times.\r\n\r\nSome of them were, I know one of them during the trial was a lawyer\r\nthere in Dallas, which I presume you all got his four-page statement,\r\nsaid he heard them discussing killing Connally a week before then, came\r\nout to my house and that had been sent to the FBI, and that was during\r\nthe trial, and I gave him a lie detector which showed that he didn't\r\nhave, this was a fanciful thing.\r\n\r\nThat, I can't think of his name, some of you all may know it, but he is\r\na lawyer there in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You found that was not anything you could rely on.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I didn't use him as a witness and after giving him the\r\npolygraph I was satisfied that he was imagining it. I think he was\r\nsincere, I don't think he was trying--I don't think he was trying to be\r\na hero or anything. I think he really thought about it so much I think\r\nhe thought that it happened, but the polygraph indicated otherwise.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you have any other evidence than the polygraph on this\r\npoint that he was not telling the truth or that this was a fiction?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, but I didn't--but I did see a report where the FBI\r\ninterviewed the girl that was allegedly with him in Ruby's place in\r\nOctober, and she didn't corroborate all of it. I think she did say he\r\nwas in there but I am not even sure of that. I didn't interview her but\r\nI just read a report on it.\r\n\r\nI read where they checked with the Department of Public Safety and\r\nthey did not, were not able to--he said he reported all this to the\r\nDepartment of Public Safety, and I don't think they found any record of\r\nhim reporting it. It is very difficult to get him to come in to see me.\r\nHe didn't just walk in, this went on for a month, I kept hearing that\r\nthere was a certain person knew about it and I kept telling him to come\r\non and talk to me and he finally came out to my house late one night.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think he actually must have thought it was so, but--I\r\nwasn't too interested in that theory of the case on this thing because\r\nI had a theory on this Ruby case from the start because I, even before\r\nyou are going to get into some of these officers' testimony in a\r\nminute, but when this happened I was going home from church, and my own\r\nmind I said I believe that was Jack Ruby who shot him because from that\r\nFriday night, and from my theory has been from that Friday night, when\r\nhe saw him there he made up his mind to kill him if he got a chance and\r\nI have had that--I didn't even know about Dean's testimony which you\r\nare going to hear today, I didn't know about his testimony until the\r\nday before I put him on the stand because I had not been preparing the\r\nevidence, I had been picking a jury for 2 weeks but that was my theory\r\nfrom the start.\r\n\r\nWe had a waitress that I think you are all familiar with that was out\r\nat B&B Cafe at 3 a.m. on the 22d who said she served Ruby and Oswald\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nB&B Cafe on Oak Lane, I know you have got that, I have seen it\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nI don't think she was ever given a polygraph test. You have about four\r\nhomosexuals, I think that is probably the word, that have said they\r\nhave seen them together places. There was some indication that Ruby\r\nwas either bisexual or homosexual, but at least, I think they testified\r\nto that in the trial, I think by mistake.\r\n\r\nBelli asked the man, meant to ask him another word and says, he meant\r\nto say homicidal tendencies and he said homosexual tendencies and his\r\none witness said yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThat is in the record which you will get of the trial, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I understood you to say when you came home from church,\r\nafter the killing of Oswald that you thought it was Ruby before you had\r\nheard that it was Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. You see, they announced Dallas businessman kills him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I took my family, I was in church with the family. I took\r\nthem on home and on the way down there they kept--they didn't say who\r\nit was but this ran through my mind, a businessman.\r\n\r\nI said that must be Jack Ruby the way he looked. He looked kind of wild\r\nto me down there Friday night the way he was running everywhere, you\r\nknow, and I said to myself that must be him. I didn't tell my wife. You\r\ncan't prove that. It is one of those things, that was my theory that\r\nhe was likely the one. I couldn't, you know, out of a million people I\r\ncouldn't say he was the one but when they announced his name I will say\r\nit didn't surprise me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, what do you want to do about Mr. Carr?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Wade, can you name to the Commission the names of\r\nthe persons who told you or who stated in your presence that they had\r\nseen Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby together?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Start out with the first one, his name.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. If anybody would mention the lawyer's name, I know him--he\r\nhas run for the legislature a number of times.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. A lawyer who lives in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. A lawyer in Dallas, and he has--we have, he made a four-page\r\naffidavit about this thing, and mailed it to J. Edgar Hoover.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You can supply his name.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. We can supply his name and I would supply you with copies of\r\nhis affidavit which I think you have.\r\n\r\nDon't you have it, isn't that up here?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Without going into that in a moment, you can refresh\r\nyour recollection and supply to the Commission the name of this lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Had he talked to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What did he say? Did he make a written statement to you\r\nor just talk to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He handed me a written statement. He said, \"The day after\r\nthis happened I made this,\" it was a copy of a written statement, he\r\nsaid, \"I sent this to J. Edgar Hoover in Washington.\" I am talking to\r\nhim, we will say, the 10th to the 20th of February, the first time I\r\ntalked with him.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I sent this to the FBI, to J. Edgar Hoover, special delivery\r\nair mail within a day or two after the assassination,\" and he left that\r\nand as far as I know I have got a copy of that, he left it with me.\r\n\r\nHe talked to me at length there at my house, just us, and I would say\r\nat 11 o'clock at night, it was on a Sunday night I know, but what\r\nSunday night I don't know. It was on a Sunday night in February. I read\r\nthat statement over. It is a rather startling thing. It didn't ring\r\ntrue to me. It all deals with a conversation between Oswald and Ruby\r\nabout killing John Connally, the Governor of Texas, over, he says, they\r\ncan't get syndicated crime in Texas without they kill the Governor.\r\n\r\nI know enough about the situation, the Governor has practically nothing\r\nto do with syndicated crime. It has to be on a local, your district\r\nattorney and your police are the ones on the firing line on that, and\r\nthey discussed at length killing him, how much they are going to pay\r\nhim, \"He wants five thousand, I believe or half of it now, and half of\r\nit when it is done.\"\r\n\r\nDon't you have this memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. There is no use of me trying to give it to you.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I was just personally trying to get your recollection\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He told me this is what happened, and I said, \"I can't put\r\nyou on the stand without I am satisfied you are telling the truth\r\nbecause,\" I said, \"We have got a good case here, and if they prove we\r\nare putting a lying witness on the stand, we might hurt us,\" and I\r\nsaid, \"The only thing I know to do I won't put you on the stand but to\r\ntake a polygraph to see if you are telling the truth or not.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I would be glad to.\" And I set it up and I later ran into\r\nhim in the lawyers' club there and he handed me another memorandum\r\nwhich amplified on the other one, which all have been furnished to the\r\nattorney general or if we didn't lose it in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nThis was during the trial actually, and then when the man called me he\r\ntook a lie detector. There was no truth in it.\r\n\r\nThat he was in the place. He was in the place, in Ruby's Carousel, but\r\nthat none of this conversation took place. He said he was in one booth\r\nand Ruby was in another booth.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did anyone else tell you that they had seen Ruby and\r\nOswald talking together?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No one else personally has told me this.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You mentioned a girl.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, I never talked to her but we had the Dallas Police take\r\nan affidavit from her and so did the FBI of that which is in all your\r\nfiles. What her name is, I just know it is a waitress out at the B&B\r\nCafe. She lived in Mesquite, Tex., and some of my people interviewed\r\nher and she told them the same thing she told the FBI.\r\n\r\nThe other information was in your FBI reports of where people or\r\nsomebody who claimed he had seen them together in a YMCA, if I recall\r\ncorrectly, and another one in a store.\r\n\r\nThe report indicated these, all these people were homosexuals as I\r\nbelieve, or there was an indication of that.\r\n\r\nI have an interview, in answering your question, in Lynn's first, but\r\nthis is the only one I have talked personally about it. But the rest of\r\nthem I got from reading the FBI and police files.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Lynn?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I believe that is his first name, and he is a lawyer there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He is the lawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That is the lawyer I am thinking about, I am trying to think\r\nof his name while I sit here.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you ever talked to anyone or has anyone ever\r\ntalked to you or in your presence about Oswald and named any other\r\nperson, other than Ruby, who they claimed were connected with Oswald in\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Senator, I don't believe anyone has talked to me. I have\r\nreceived, I guess 5,000 letters about this thing from all over the\r\ncountry, which I have down there. I remember somebody wrote me from\r\nWest Virginia and said that in West Virginia that Oswald was in a used\r\ncar business and Ruby was across the street from him.\r\n\r\nWell, I furnished this information to the investigative agencies but\r\nas far as personally, I don't know of any. I have had a lot of letters\r\nthat said they were connected but not based on anything.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But leave Ruby out now for a moment, did anyone ever\r\ntell you that Oswald was connected with persons other than Ruby in the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nHave you heard the names of any other persons who it is claimed had\r\nsomething to do with the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know of any names. Of course, like I said there\r\nwas the head of the Fair Play for Cuba, whatever his name was, was\r\nmentioned. Everything I know on that score was from the police. When I\r\nwent up there Friday night and again I believe it was Saturday night\r\nor Sunday, they told me that they just talked like he was the biggest\r\nCommunist, they had all kinds of evidence that he was a Communist, and\r\nthat he was working with other people.\r\n\r\nI believe Captain Fritz told me once that he showed at the time that\r\nOswald bristled most was when they would talk about Castro. Apparently\r\nhe was more friendly to Castro than he was for instance to Khrushchev,\r\nI am using those in broad terms.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Of course, once Oswald was killed, then your duties\r\nwere connected with the prosecution of Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And there wasn't any occasion for you then to search\r\nout----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I had this, Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Other persons.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I had this, Senator, I had this, when he was killed and they\r\ntried to give me the files. I told them no, to give them to the FBI\r\nbecause we couldn't try him, and I went to work on Ruby and actually\r\nwouldn't know it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I picked up it appeared to me there was no question that he\r\nreceived his inspiration on this and maybe other help from somewhere.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is what I am driving at here. You know there have\r\nbeen statements made that other persons could have been connected with\r\nOswald in the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDo you have any facts to give the Commission which would bear upon that\r\nquestion that any person other than Oswald was in any way connected\r\nwith the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I have no facts that I can give you on it. It is one of these\r\nthings, and the reason I gave you what my opinion on the thing was, I\r\nhave read what the U.S. World News and Report said the Commission is\r\ngoing to say, and also this deal out in Japan, you know, where they\r\nsaid that he was not instantaneous, impulsive, I believe, killer of the\r\nPresident, which sounded silly to me.\r\n\r\nI mean he planned the thing. He practiced shooting, and he had his\r\ninspiration from somebody else. Whether he had a--was working with\r\nsomeone, I don't know. I never did know, it was rumored all over town\r\nthat they had an airplane there to carry him out of town. I am sure you\r\nall have checked into that but I never know whether they did or not.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to have been something misfired in the thing if there was\r\nanybody tried to get it. I don't think there was anybody with him in\r\nthe shooting but what you are getting at is if there was anyone back of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI always felt that the minimum was an inspiration from some cause, and\r\nthe maximum was actual pay, but like you asked for evidence, I don't\r\nhave any.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ever hear about any evidence that there was an\r\nairplane stationed any place there?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They ran it in the newspapers that an airplane was supposedly\r\nto pick him up but nobody ever found the airplane, so far as I know.\r\nYou have had every kind of rumor, this has been a thing that has been,\r\nthat the press has been most inaccurate in a lot of things they have\r\nreported, and it is because of the pressure from their offices to get a\r\nRuby story.\r\n\r\nWe have reporters down there coming down and said, \"My office said to\r\nwrite something on Ruby today, what are we going to write.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it has been so very irresponsible.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I have no evidence and the only thing where I get my\r\nimpression is reading and hearing people talking but I haven't actually\r\nfigured it wasn't any of my business on Oswald, that I had a problem,\r\na big one of trying Ruby and I have concentrated all of my efforts on\r\nthat and when we had anybody of this nature we would refer them to the\r\nFBI or some other agency.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You referred, Mr. Wade, to some testimony or some evidence\r\nthat Oswald was at one time in the Carousel when Ruby was there.\r\n\r\nWas that solely from this lawyer whose testimony you have mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The only one of my personal knowledge that I talked with\r\nwas from the lawyer. He told me he was there with a certain girl, a\r\nstripper, and Ruby and Oswald were in an adjoining booth. There is\r\nlots of other people, I think your master of ceremonies, they had him\r\non television and said he had seen them there but later on said he\r\nhadn't when they got to interviewing him. But my own personal knowledge\r\nthat you are all interested in was that one man who told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was there anyone either from the State or Federal\r\nGovernment that urged you not to state a crime of international\r\nconspiracy if you found one was present?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; not in that light. It is like I mentioned to you what\r\nMr. Carr and Mr. Sanders both inquired, said they had heard on the\r\nradio about this or talked with someone in Washington about it, and\r\nI told them right off that whether it was so or not doesn't make any\r\ndifference. It wouldn't be alleged. I mean if I had known he was a\r\nCommunist I wouldn't have alleged it. I mean, suppose I knew he was a\r\nCommunist, and signed a statement he was a Communist. That was a time\r\nwhen the press blew up when they had nothing else to talk about at the\r\ntime, actually.\r\n\r\nThe answer to your question is \"No.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was any statement made by you as to whether or not there\r\nwas any international conspiracy, conspiracy with Oswald about the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I don't think there was. I think in one of those\r\ninterviews you will find that I said they found some literature or\r\nsomething from the Fair Play for Cuba at his home, something to that\r\neffect. If I did anything, that was all that was said, in one of those\r\ninterviews.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did anybody ask you to say anything one way or another\r\nabout that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. If they did I don't remember it. I am sure they asked that,\r\nbut I am talking about, I mean in all these interviews, that was the\r\nthing where they were trying to prove a connection or something, you\r\nknow, and I told them I knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But no officials asked you to say anything about it\r\npublicly or otherwise?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did anybody ask you at any time not to say that a foreign\r\ngovernment was involved if you found it was or anything about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Your FBI man may have. I don't know. I talked to him two or\r\nthree times. I wish I could think of his name because I don't think I\r\never met him. He was an inspector out of Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He is not our FBI man, he is the FBI. We are an independent\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I see. But he had talked with me something, I think his\r\nconversation, as I recall, largely dealt with the giving out of\r\ninformation. He was concerned about it and so was I, and where we had\r\nthe longest conversation was, I will run through Sunday, and get me\r\nup to it real fast because I talked to him Sunday night. We haven't\r\ncovered one of my television interviews.\r\n\r\nAfter I went down to the police station and I will take this real fast\r\nif it is all right with you all, they told me that Oswald had been shot\r\nand I was there in the Chief's office when he died, when Oswald died\r\nand the Chief says I have got to go out here and announce it.\r\n\r\nSo as he went out for a press conference, I went down the back door,\r\nwent home and went to bed because I was tired and disappointed actually\r\nbecause we got even interested in trying Oswald, and I didn't mean to\r\nhave anything else further to say.\r\n\r\nI woke up about 5 o'clock and a national commentator was giving the\r\nDallas police hell, me hell, and just about everybody hell, and saying\r\nthat I had said that the case, there would be nothing further on the\r\ncase, it would be closed, in which I had never even had a television\r\ninterview, I don't know where they got it.\r\n\r\nSomebody might have said that. I don't know but it wasn't me because I\r\nhadn't talked to anybody.\r\n\r\nAnd then I went out to dinner and got to thinking, I said, well now,\r\nthe Dallas police did have a breakdown in security here, and they\r\nare taking a beating and I am taking a beating, but they did have\r\nthe right man according to my thinking, so I went down to the police\r\nstation and got all the brass in there but Chief Curry and I said this\r\nstuff, people are saying on there you had the wrong man and you all\r\nwere the one who killed him or let him out here to have him killed\r\nintentionally, I said somebody ought to go out in television and lay\r\nout the evidence that you had on Oswald, and tell them everything.\r\n\r\nIt had been most of it laid out but not in chronological order.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was this now?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. This was 8 o'clock roughly on the 24th. Sunday night. I sat\r\ndown with Captain Fritz and took a pencil and pad and listed about\r\nseven pieces of evidence from my own knowledge and I was going to write\r\nit down. They got hold of Chief Curry and he said no, that he had told\r\nthis inspector of the FBI that there would be nothing further said\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nI asked Chief Batchelor and Lumpkin, they were all there, I said you\r\nall are the ones who know something about it, I said if you have at\r\nleast got the right man in my opinion the American people ought to know.\r\n\r\nThis is evidence you can't use actually, because he is dead. You can't\r\ntry him. And the upshot of that was the police wouldn't say a word and\r\nrefused actually to furnish me any more of the details on this.\r\n\r\nI mean what the seven points. I went on out there in from front of\r\nthe cameras and ran them through those points. Actually my purpose\r\nin it was, good or bad was, because the Dallas police were taking a\r\nbeating because they had solved the crime and had good evidence and\r\nI told them it was good but I did leave out some things and I was\r\na little inaccurate in one or two things but it was because of the\r\ncommunications with the police.\r\n\r\nI didn't have the map, incidentally. I wanted the map at that time but\r\nforgot all about it, and I ran through just what I knew, which probably\r\nwas worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nIt probably would have been better off without giving anything, because\r\nwe didn't give what all we had.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you remember the elements of inaccuracy that got into\r\nthis statement of yours?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think I told them about the palmprint on the bottom of the\r\ngun, that Lane has made a great issue of and I still think I was right\r\non it but he has made an issue. I think Oswald snapped the pistol over\r\nthere in the jail or at least in the theater where they arrested him.\r\nThere was a question of whether the gun had been snapped or not and I\r\nwas told it was, you all may have seen the gun; I never have seen the\r\ngun. You had--I might have at that stage said what bullets are supposed\r\nto hit whom. That might have been somewhat inaccurate then but that is\r\nall I can think of.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any basic thing. But my purpose in that, and I\r\nknow the minute I got off that television, inspection called me and\r\nsaid please say nothing further about this case.\r\n\r\nWell, you see, at that stage----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was it that called you?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The inspector at FBI called me in the police station. He\r\nwas the one the police had talked to. He was the man from Dallas down\r\nthere. It wasn't Shanklin, Shanklin was in charge of the office.\r\n\r\nBut I told him what my purpose was but apparently someone told him. I\r\ngathered since he had delivered a message, apparently someone had told\r\nhim to have me quit talking about it. But my purpose on that was, I\r\nnever did think that the people or the television were giving the right\r\nfacts on the thing and they were making believe that probably they\r\ndidn't have the right one, that the Dallas police had him in there to\r\nkill him, they even had commentators saying practically that, don't you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nSo, I did that entirely--not anything for me. You may think I wanted to\r\nbe on television. I didn't care a thing about being because I don't run\r\nfor office in New York and Washington and other places, but I thought\r\nthe police needed, because their morale was awfully low and they were\r\nat fault in Ruby killing him.\r\n\r\nThere was undoubtedly a breakdown on security there in the basement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. On the seven points were any of them that were new that\r\nhadn't already been told to the public?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. To tell you the truth, I don't know. I think there were some\r\nof them that hadn't been but I think most of them had. But I couldn't\r\nsee at this stage the evidence on this thing, nobody, the situation\r\nwhere you had an assassination, and a dead person and another case\r\npending, and it was against my interest actually, to trying Ruby, it\r\nwould be a whole lot better trying Ruby if he killed the wrong man\r\nthan if he killed the assassin of the President, but I was trying to\r\nestablish that this was the assassin of the President.\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't give all the evidence, and I don't know whether there was\r\nanything new or not because I didn't see much of television during all\r\nthis time. I don't actually know everything that was given out, and\r\nthere was so much in the papers that I didn't have time to read them,\r\nso I didn't know for sure what all the police had given out.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Substantially then, you were laying out to the public\r\nthe facts which had led you to issue a warrant for Oswald as the killer\r\nof President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That was the purpose of that interview.\r\n\r\nYou also have to--I don't know where you gentlemen were, but you have\r\nto get a picture of what was going on. You had, of course, there in\r\nDallas, you had threats on people's lives everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it ran over the radio that I had been\r\nassassinated, for 2 hours, on Monday morning. I wasn't listening to the\r\nradio. My wife called me up--called me up and I denied it. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. But you had lots of things of that kind. And I thought you\r\nneeded some type of, somebody--and your whole thing was wrong with this\r\nwhole deal, you had no one in charge of the thing. You had the police,\r\nthe FBI, the Secret Service, the Department of Justice, my Department,\r\nWaggoner Carr's department, but no one had any say to offer the rest of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Tell us how that affected it. You had the jurisdiction of\r\nthe crime itself.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of the trial of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the police department, what jurisdiction did they have?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They had the jurisdiction, the primary responsibility for the\r\ninvestigation of the assassination, and--they had the primary job of\r\nfinding out who did it and getting the evidence. They were assisted,\r\nthe Secret Service, of course, had the job of protecting the President.\r\nThe FBI, they have criminal, pretty general, investigation, I am not\r\nsure, but they were in on it, they were all there, and assisting. It\r\nwas a deal where nobody had any actual control over another person.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had the State authorities any jurisdiction or effect on the\r\noperation?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. You mean the State?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They actually had none. They had no authority. The Governor\r\nhas no authority in a situation like this nor the attorney general\r\nother than in a vague sort of way, as the police, I guess they had\r\nthe police powers to some extent of maintaining order but you didn't\r\nneed the National Guard or anything. I mean this was more dealing with\r\na situation of information. I think this situation is true in many\r\nStates, in practically all of them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that confusing, did that make it harder to try to solve\r\nthe crime and handle the problems?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It did; very much so. Your press was the most confusing\r\nthing. I mean you couldn't get in the police station. I mean I just\r\nbarely could get into the police station myself for stomping over the\r\npress and you had a lot of reporters, not like the reporters we usually\r\ndeal with down there. I mean we don't have trouble usually with the\r\nlocal press, people we pretty well know.\r\n\r\nWe would tell them what is going on, and they will go on, but these\r\npeople just followed everybody everywhere they went, and they were\r\nthrowing policemen on the corner, if he made a statement about he saw\r\nsomeone running that way dressed maybe like the killer--they ran all\r\nthat on. They were just running everybody. There was no control over\r\nyour public media. It made it worse since all television networks were\r\non the assassination all--24 hours, I mean all day. And there was no\r\ncentral thing from--there was no central person who had any control\r\nof handling the thing that information was given out. You see they\r\ninterviewed some of your patrolmen who were giving out evidence, you\r\nknow, some of your foot patrolmen on the corner, they were interviewing\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would it help or hinder the handling of such a crime of the\r\nkilling of the President if it was a Federal crime, in your opinion?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, offhand, I think probably it would, but----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It would help?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think it would help, but you are going to have the same\r\nsituation. I am thinking if you had, if it is a Federal crime, for\r\ninstance, it is still murder in Texas. If Captain Fritz and the Dallas\r\npolice had arrested this man, the FBI wouldn't have had him. I don't\r\ncare if it was a Federal crime. We have bank robberies where there is\r\njoint jurisdiction. The one that gets him, if it is the State police or\r\nthe city police gets them, they file with me and if the FBI gets them\r\nthey file with the Federal.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You need more control over the police investigation in\r\norder to carry out your duties, is that----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of course; my idea if you had it to do over, it is easy to\r\ndo that, but I think you need someone where all the information is\r\nchanneled through one person. If anything is given out and getting an\r\nintelligent person, not just a police officer, you know. Now, your\r\ncity manager of Dallas is a newspaper man, Elgin Crull, he would have\r\nbeen an ideal person and he was there but I don't think he ever said\r\nanything in any way. He was there in the middle of all that thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is the lawyer that you referred to in answer to Senator\r\nCooper's questions Carroll Jarnegan?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Carroll Jarnegan is his name; yes, sir. Let me mention\r\nanother thing for the record here. I don't know whether it is\r\nmentioned. Saturday, most of my day was spent in talking to Dean R. G.\r\nStorey, and the dean of the Harvard Law School, raising, wondering what\r\nthe situation was with reference to attorneys for Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What Saturday are you talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Saturday the 23d, 1963; November 23. I told them that, all\r\nof them, we had calls from various people, and most of them was from\r\npeople here in the East calling lawyers there in Dallas rather than me,\r\nand them calling me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What were they saying to you about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, they were very upset, one, in looking at American\r\njustice where the man didn't have an attorney, as apparently, and two,\r\nthat too much information was being given to the press too, by the\r\npolice and by me, some of them had said, and that is what prompted me\r\nprobably to talk to Chief Curry about the thing, because I had received\r\nsome of those calls.\r\n\r\nI told them they ought to appoint the president of the bar association\r\nand the president of the Criminal Bar Association to represent him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who did you tell that to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Told that to Mr. Paul Carrington and also to Mr. Storey, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nI believe they are the two that discussed it more at length with me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether anything was done about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They got ahold of Louis Nichols who is the president of\r\nthe Dallas Bar Association. They got ahold of the president of the\r\nCriminal Bar Association, but they had started a Tippit fund in the\r\nmeantime, and practically every lawyer was scared they were going to be\r\nappointed, you know, and they had gone and subscribed to that fund so\r\nthey were having much trouble getting a lawyer appointed.\r\n\r\nNow, I must go a little further and tell you that under Texas law that\r\nis an improper time to appoint them. The only one who can actually\r\nappoint him is the judge after indictment under the Texas law, no one\r\nelse has really authority.\r\n\r\nLouis Nichols, I talked to him, the president of the bar, and he was\r\ntrying to get some criminal lawyer to go down there with him, and I\r\nsaid, \"Go down there yourself and talk to him because they are raising\r\njust so much cain about it and see what they want and tell him you will\r\nget him a lawyer.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You are speaking now about a lawyer for Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; for Oswald.\r\n\r\nThis was around noon or some time on Saturday, noon, early afternoon.\r\nThis went on all day. He called me back and said, \"I have talked to\r\nhim and told him I would get him a lawyer, that I would represent him\r\nor get him a lawyer.\" Louis Nichols is a civil lawyer, not actually a\r\ncriminal lawyer.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"He doesn't want but one lawyer, John Abt, in New York.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who is he?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He is an attorney in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said he didn't want any attorney?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Lee Harvey Oswald told Nichols and Nichols told me this. He\r\nsaid that. Nichols then said he told him, along with the police they\r\nwould try to get ahold of Mr. Abt, which they did. I think, I think\r\nmaybe the press found him before the lawyers found him. But he says\r\nsomething that he didn't have time or something, as I understand it.\r\nThis was all reported in the press. He had said the second person he\r\nwanted, Lee Harvey Oswald told Nichols the second person he wanted, was\r\nsome lawyer out in Chicago with the American Civil Liberties Union, his\r\nname I don't know what it was, but Nichols would know.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"If I can't get either one of those I will help get a local\r\nlawyer,\" because that was all done Saturday, with reference to his\r\nobtaining a lawyer.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get that because I think you probably knew it and get it in\r\nthe record anyhow.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now going back to this telephone conversation with Mr. Carr\r\nthat you referred to, do you remember anything else that Mr. Carr said\r\nto you at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't actually even remember, you know, he said that he had\r\nhad a call from Washington, I don't actually remember anything about\r\nthat. I remember he said that about this charge that this is going.\r\n\"This would be a bad situation, if you allege it as part of a Russian,\r\nthe Russian conspiracy, and it may affect your international relations,\r\na lot of things, of the country,\" and I said it was silly because I\r\ndon't know where the rumor started but I will see even if it was so we\r\ncould prove it, I wouldn't allege it. Isn't that about it, the way you\r\nrecall it, Mr. Carr?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. We will call him in a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was he during that conversation saying anything to you\r\nabout not alleging it if it were true?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; it was a question of, he had heard we were going to\r\nallege it and he asked me about it and I said it is silly. I had heard\r\nsomething, I think, about it, about the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd to no one, if it was part of it, no one said they necessarily\r\nwanted to hush the thing up, but it was a situation where the minute\r\nthey mentioned what their problem was, it sounded silly to me, I said\r\nwhether he is a member of the Communist Party or not is not important\r\nin this charge.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there any official, anyone on your staff or any\r\npersons charged with law enforcement in Dallas, or any U.S. district\r\nattorney in Dallas or anyone connected with his office, to your\r\nknowledge ever suggest that there should be a charge of conspiracy?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. None to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow, I will say in some of these conversations, like I said, I don't\r\nknow whether it was with Waggoner Carr or Barefoot Sanders, they said,\r\none said, \"Well, David Johnston, the J. P. has said this,\" and the\r\nother one has said, \"Bill Alexander, one of your assistants who was up\r\nat the police department said it.\"\r\n\r\nI asked them both about it and they both denied it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did anyone ever say to you in the event there was a\r\ncharge of conspiracy who would be named other than Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; there is no other names, there is no other name that\r\nI know of that has ever been mentioned to me as being part of the\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe question we are talking about here, if I understand it, being that\r\nOswald, as a part of an international conspiracy, did murder John\r\nFitzgerald Kennedy. And there is no other names of co-conspirators, we\r\nhave had lots of leads run down upon it. Somebody at the penitentiary\r\ndown there, a colored person, at least the word to us, that he had told\r\nthe guard he had hauled Oswald away from there, you all probably got\r\nthis, but we interviewed him down there.\r\n\r\nHe was just talking and wanting to come back to Dallas. But there had\r\nbeen lots of things of that kind but to my knowledge none of them have\r\nactually been proven out.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Wade, I don't think you have quite finished the--all of\r\nyour--hour-by-hour description of what happened up through the killing\r\nof Mr. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I thought I had hit it. The only thing I can't remember now\r\nis the Saturday night.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like I was down at the police station Saturday night. Why I\r\ndon't know and maybe for a short while and don't recall everything that\r\nhappened. That was Saturday, 23d of November, and there is nothing, the\r\ncharge had already been taken, and I think probably I was on my way\r\nhome and just stopped by to see what was going on.\r\n\r\nAt that time there wasn't anything going on and I went home.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you do anything more about the press and TV and radio\r\npeople crowding into the police station than you have already described?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; you see--I have been in that building probably once every\r\n2 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the other end of town from my building. I never go up there\r\nand I don't think it is my business what goes on up there. Maybe it\r\nshould be, but I have never been considering it. I think I have enough\r\nproblems down at my end of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In any event you didn't do anything.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I didn't tell them anything, I could see the confusion they\r\nwere getting into but I don't know of anything that I told about, but\r\nwhat if I did, I had no control over it. It was one of those things I\r\njust figured I was the one who didn't have the say in it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you do on Sunday, the 25th?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, went to church.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The 24th.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I went to church, my family and I went to Dr. W. J. Martin's\r\nnondenominational church. It has 27 different denominations, very\r\nbright fellow, if you are in Dallas you ought to go and hear him.\r\n\r\nAnd as I walked out somebody said they shot Oswald. So I took--turned\r\non the radio and took my wife and kids home, and went down to the\r\npolice station.\r\n\r\nThere were still fragments of the story coming in, and we would still\r\nget every kind of story out of them, and we got down there at I guess\r\n1:30. He died and then like I said, I think all I told the press, they\r\nasked me as I left there, a few of them what we would do on Ruby and I\r\nsaid we would ask the death penalty on him, and then I left and I went\r\nhome and then I followed it that night and giving them what evidence I\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with a lawyer by the name of\r\nTom Howard in connection with that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; Tom Howard had filed some kind of writ of habeas\r\ncorpus, assault to murder, and I never did see him. I saw Bob Stinson,\r\nanother lawyer on a corner and he said he and Robey were going to\r\nrepresent him, which, I don't think they did, but they said they were\r\nand so I went on home, and then when he died, we had a murder case, and\r\nwe took it to the grand jury the next morning, I believe, on Monday\r\nmorning and indicted him, turned it into Judge Joe Brown's court and I\r\nwas there, and as the grand jury walked in he said, \"When are you going\r\nto hear Ruby?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I already have got the indictment here,\" and I said, then\r\nI went right back and asked the judge to transfer it over to Judge\r\nHenry King's court or Frank Wilson's court.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know what happened to that habeas corpus of Tom\r\nHoward's?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't have anything to do with it?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I understand from hearsay it disappeared or somewhere down\r\nthere but we don't have anything to do with writs. But they don't come\r\nthrough our office. You see that is directed by the judge. I heard or\r\nat least Decker or somebody told me they never could find the writ but\r\nthere was some writ for assault to murder originally issued.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, after he died and the murder charge was filed,\r\nwell, that would actually be out of date.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was it a writ of habeas corpus to bring Oswald before a\r\ncourt?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No. Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It was actually, they have two kinds of writs, one of them is\r\nwhere they set a bond on it and another one is what they have called a\r\ndry writ which says, \"You file on him or bring him before me at such\r\nand such a time.\"\r\n\r\nWhich one it was I don't know. As a matter of fact, I thought there\r\nwas a bond set on it, but I told the chief, I said, \"You can hold him,\r\nwe don't want to release him until you know whether the person dies or\r\nnot because then he wouldn't be a bailable case,\" assault to murder is\r\nbailable.\r\n\r\nI never saw the writ or anything. I just heard somebody say there is a\r\nwrit on him.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chairman Warren entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever help Ruby about any of his troubles of any\r\nkind?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Prior to this occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I think we have had him for a liquor violation or\r\nsomething, but if we have--like I say, I never knew him. I think that\r\nthey have had some charges against him.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, they had two pistol charges against him but I\r\ndon't think they ever reached my office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know what charges they were about pistols?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Carrying a concealed weapon and if I understand the record I\r\nthink we checked it out and they dismissed them up in the police force.\r\n\r\nThere was one liquor case that was dismissed in my office by an\r\nassistant who is no longer there which I have read the reports on and\r\ndon't have any recollection of it either way.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know Eva Grant?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Ruby's sister. Do you know Sam Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I knew none of them, none of the Ruby family, and didn't know\r\nJack Ruby. I think he claims that he had known me or something or other\r\nbut if he had, it is one of those things where you see somebody and I\r\ndidn't know his name or anything when I saw him that night or didn't\r\nknow who he was. I thought he was a member of the press, actually.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did it come to your attention that there was some claim\r\nthat Oswald was an agent of one of the intelligence agencies of\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I heard that talk down there. It was talk some----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know who was talking that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know. I have been up here once before, and some of\r\nthe press were--I don't remember, some of the press mentioned that\r\nthey had two voucher numbers in his book there that indicated he was\r\nworking for the FBI or the CIA. I know nothing about them, don't think\r\nanybody in my office does. I think maybe Alexander mentioned it some,\r\nbut Alexander is not a great lover of the FBI. They fuss all the time\r\nopenly, so I don't know. I know nothing about it myself because I never\r\nhave seen the book and I don't know whether they have even got any\r\nnumbers in there but they were supposed to have two numbers in there as\r\na voucher number of $200 from some Government agency but like I say,\r\nsupposed to.\r\n\r\nI never saw it and heard it, talk, but I am sure you all know more\r\nabout it than I do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By voucher you mean an entry or something of that kind,\r\nwhat kind of a voucher?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think it was called a voucher number, it was voucher 209,\r\nwhich doesn't make sense. I believe it was a low number. It doesn't\r\nmake sense for a government to have a voucher number that low.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What book are you referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The little black book that Oswald had in his possession at\r\nthe time he was arrested.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That was his memorandum book, in which he had a list of\r\nnumbers of various people and addresses and so forth, is that what you\r\nreferring to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; and I never have seen the book myself. As a matter of\r\nfact, I am trying to get some photos of it, trying to but I haven't\r\ngotten them yet.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now what agency was it rumored he was a member of?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It was rumored he worked first for the FBI and then for the\r\nCIA.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that all you have heard?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. As a matter of fact, I don't think I had ever heard that\r\nuntil Waggoner Carr called me and told me--I don't think I ever heard\r\nthat. I did check into it a little, and they were talking it some, and\r\nthey have actually written it up in the newspapers by rumors or a story\r\nor two--rumors of the thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the report by the reporter Hudkins?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I believe it is. On the Houston paper, Hudkins. I believe we\r\ngot that introduced in the Ruby trial on the change of venue motion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything more that you know about that matter?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I know absolutely nothing about it. I might say, I was under\r\nthe impression, I think when I talked to you and the Chief Justice\r\nbefore, that, you see I was in the FBI, and I was under the impression\r\nand I think maybe I told you all that we didn't list our informant\r\nby name. The FBI have been kind enough to send down some of my old\r\nvouchers on paying informants back in, down in South America, and I\r\nsee that we did list them by name which I--probably may, if I said\r\notherwise it was just my recollection on the thing but in that case I\r\nwas listing informants from South America that we were paying when I\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There was one other report by Goulden, reporter of the\r\nPhiladelphia Inquirer. Did that ever come to your attention in regard\r\nto this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; but I know him. He used to be a reporter in Dallas, but I\r\ndon't know what it was, if you will tell me about it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Apparently it was the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Different angle.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. From Hudkins' report that had been picked up.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He is more reliable than Hudkins but I know absolutely\r\nnothing about that. Like I say, I have heard rumors and conversation\r\nand I will even put it further, I don't think Alexander knows anything\r\nabout it, my assistant, although he doesn't fully admit all that. I\r\nthink he would like to talk a little about it but I don't think he\r\nknows anything of his own knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you inquired of him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I have asked him about it and he gives me nothing in the way\r\nof evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you prepare the complaint in regard to Jack Ruby\r\nyourself?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't believe I did. I don't believe I had anything to do\r\nwith it. If I did, my name will show on it but I don't think I had\r\nanything to do with it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you give any information to the press about what you\r\nhad in regard to that prosecution, and the nature of the evidence?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; not that I know of. Of course, they all saw it on\r\ntelevision, you know. We have got in--to bring you through the whole\r\nstory, I said practically nothing about this thing for about 3 weeks or\r\na month, but we had a lawyer on the other side who came into town and\r\nevery time he was met at the airport he would make statements.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Mr. Melvin Belli, and he had his psychiatrist on the\r\ntelevision, all his witnesses, said what he was going to prove and it\r\ngot to a situation where I had to do a little talking in self-defense,\r\nand so we did later on have some statements more or less in answer to\r\nhis. It was entirely too much trying of that in the newspapers but a\r\nsituation where we couldn't let his psychiatrist go on there and prove\r\nhe had been insane on the jury without at least our saying we had some\r\nevidence that he was sane.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have anything to do with the preparation of the\r\ncase for trial?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, to some extent. You see I had four assistants to assist\r\nme in the trial.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Jim Bowie, Frank Watt, and Bill Alexander. I read most of the\r\nreports on it. I mean I had most of what I did was read things on it\r\nbecause my main job in the trial as we started out was for me to pick\r\nthe jury, which I did, I think I have some ability along that line, and\r\ndo a great deal of the cross examination and the final argument. That\r\nis what I do in the cases I participate in usually.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Alexander spent the 2 weeks we were picking a jury in viewing\r\nthe witnesses. I never talked to any of the witnesses. After the\r\nfirst half a day of testimony I was very disappointed in the way the\r\nwitnesses were being put on the stand; if this is of interest to you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Tell us what happened.\r\n\r\nMr WADE. I told him, I said, on this case we are going on this theory,\r\nI want everybody who saw Ruby from the time of the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy down to the time he killed Oswald, I want to prove\r\nwhere he was every minute of the time that I can and then we will take\r\nit from there and put the films on there and show what happened there\r\nand then afterward. We are going on the theory that he is a glory\r\nseeker and a hero because I was convinced that was the motive of the\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nI put on seven witnesses, and about six of them testified against us, I\r\nthink, or made poor witnesses saying if they saw him down in the Dallas\r\nNews where he was 2 minutes in a stare that never made any sense.\r\n\r\nSome of them said they thought there was something wrong with him and\r\nnone of them were the type of witnesses that I wanted testifying for\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, you can check the first seven witnesses in the case.\r\nYou had three from the Dallas News who testified, and so during that\r\nnoon hour, I was convinced, whether right or wrong that Alexander had\r\nbeen more interested in talking to the press.\r\n\r\nIn my office our biggest problem was keeping the press out of the\r\noffice, and so I just would have to bar them from my office, I mean\r\npersonal property. He wouldn't do it. He liked to talk to them.\r\n\r\nSo, I said, \"Get all these witnesses in during the noon hour and let me\r\ntalk to them.\"\r\n\r\nI put all the witnesses on the next morning. I talked to all the\r\nofficers, I talked to Officers Dean, McMillon, Archer, King never had\r\ntalked with them about the case before and I talked with them then and\r\nI put all of them on next morning.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Tell us what starting with--which one did you talk to\r\nfirst, Archer, Dean, or McMillon.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think I talked to all of them at first in a body. I talked\r\nto----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I had them all in there and said \"Now what do you know about\r\nthe case?\" because a lot of them I didn't know what they knew.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did they say?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. As a matter of fact, I wasn't familiar with Dean's testimony\r\nuntil he told me right there a day before he testified. Then he showed\r\nme the memorandum that he had made on the thing. I talked with him\r\nthere and I put Archer on the next morning and McMillon on, who stayed\r\nall day. They cross-examined him from 11:30 until 5:30. Then I put King\r\non, and then Dean, I believe the next morning, and we rested. But they\r\ntold me just what they testified to in the trial which I don't know\r\nwhether I can give all of it but I can tell you roughly that McMillon\r\nand Archer were partners and heard Ruby say some things, \"I hope I\r\nkilled the sonofabitch.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Within about a few seconds after the killing and then\r\nupstairs then, \"I meant to shoot three times but you all got me before\r\nI did.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally, you may not know it but their psychiatrist corroborated\r\nthat statement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Dr. Guttmacher on cross-examination. We asked Dr. Guttmacher,\r\n\"Well, didn't Ruby tell you that he meant to shoot three times?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Yes; and he told me that.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"One time he told me that.\" He also said at one time he told\r\nhim otherwise but he corroborated that portion of it. Then it seemed\r\nlike there was something else said. Archer said to him as he got up in\r\nthe jail, \"I believe he is going to die, Jack.\" I may be getting these\r\nwrong, but they are roughly--he said something about, \"You fellows\r\ncouldn't do it,\" or talking about the police, and, I believe that was\r\nArcher and McMillon.\r\n\r\nMaybe you all being lawyers, in Texas this is not admissible unless\r\nit is part of the res gestae. Mr. Belli sent into McMillon all\r\nconversations in the jail that happened 4 hours later.\r\n\r\nUnder our law if one side goes into a conversation we can bring out\r\nanything in the conversation, the rest of the conversation. That is a\r\nrule of law in Texas, I don't know whether it is that way everywhere\r\nelse, and so that was the theory that made Dean's testimony admissible\r\nbecause had been in the jail--time varies from 20 minutes to an hour,\r\ndepending on who you are listening to.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have to go to a quorum call.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Wade, could you tell us a little more clearly what was\r\ninvolved in regard to this testimony? Did the defense start introducing\r\ntestimony concerning these conversations, is that what you are telling\r\nus?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The defense cross-examined McMillon--you see McMillon and\r\nArcher stayed with Ruby until 4 o'clock that afternoon when he was\r\nturned over to Captain Fritz or roughly. I am giving a rough hour of 4\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did they stay with him?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. In the jail. They were--I don't say both of them were there\r\nbut they were assigned there and another person. The three of them or\r\ntwo of them were there at all times, along with your jailers, they were\r\ninside the jail.\r\n\r\nDuring this time he went into conversations, for instance he said,\r\n\"Didn't I tell you that he left his dog out in the car?\" He said, \"Yes,\r\nthey did,\" but this is something that happened an hour and a half after\r\nthey had been in jail.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By \"he\" there you mean Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Ruby.\r\n\r\nAnd they said also, \"Didn't he tell you about going to the Western\r\nUnion,\" and he said, \"Weren't you there when Sorrels and Dean came up\r\nthere, and what was the first thing that Sorrels asked him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did they say when that was?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, you are going to find your time varies from 20 minutes\r\nto an hour, depending on whether it is a defense theory or our theory,\r\nbut----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After what?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. After the killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think Dean, I would rather you get the record, and you can\r\nget it accurate, but I think he said it was some time before 20 minutes\r\nto 12 or some time before 12. Well, the killing happened at 11:21, I\r\nthink. That seems to be the best time, 11:21.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did they describe what the conversation was with Ruby when\r\nSorrels and Dean were there?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They told, if I recall, what Sorrels asked him and he asked\r\nhim \"What did you do it for, Jack?\" or something; they knew that part\r\nof it but they weren't present during that conversation between--they\r\nwere in the room but I may say not within hearing distance. They heard\r\npart of what was said but not all of the conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By \"they\" who do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I am talking about McMillon and Archer.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did they hear?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, that is all I know that was testified to. Now, whether\r\nthey heard anything else I don't know. But that is all I know, the\r\nbeginning of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThey had heard previous to this coming up there the conversation about\r\nJack, \"I think he is going to die,\" and Jack answered some question, I\r\nbelieve he said, \"You couldn't do it, somebody had to,\" or something\r\nlike that. Jack Ruby, I am referring to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did that occur?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That occurred as they arrived on the floor where the jail is,\r\nthe fifth floor, I believe, of the jail.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then what else could they testify to?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That was about all we used them for, actually, that was\r\nthe last that we put on, but they asked them some questions of what\r\nhappened. Didn't he tell Captain Fritz something at 4 o'clock that\r\nafternoon, but our testimony from them actually that amounted to\r\nanything quit when they came on to the floor there of the jail. That is\r\nMcMillon and Archer.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Dean's testimony came on and only--I am kind of\r\nanticipating your questions on this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where was Dean then?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. They were in the jail. Dean----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who else?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Sorrels, Forest Sorrels. I am not testifying as a fact but\r\nthis was all told to me, of course, by Dean and Sorrels.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The following day during the noon hour I found for the first\r\ntime that Sorrels was present in the jail. I told the sheriff there I\r\nwould like to talk to Sorrels and he came down there and he and Dean\r\nand I talked in my office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is the following day?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That is Thursday before we rested the case on Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us the approximate date that you talked to\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It seems like we started on the 17th, and this was 2 weeks----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. 17th of what month?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of February.\r\n\r\nMaybe we started on the 10th, because they ended on the 14th, 17th to\r\nthe 14th, I would say this was around the 6th of March roughly, a day\r\nor two either way.\r\n\r\nI sat down there to talk to Dean and Sorrels because we was going to\r\nput--and Sorrels showed me a copy of his report made on that incident\r\nwhich I didn't keep a copy but I am sure you all have a copy of it or\r\nit will be available to you.\r\n\r\nI read it over, and essentially from what Dean said, and him were the\r\nsame with other than the, I think the only variance was the part which\r\nwas strong testimony where Dean said that Ruby said, \"The first time I\r\nthought of killing him was Friday night or thought about killing him\r\nwas Friday night in the lineup.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Sorrels didn't have that in his statement, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He didn't have that in his statement, and I, to go back a\r\nlittle bit, I asked Sorrels how he got up in the jail and he said he\r\ndidn't know, and he said he didn't actually know Dean there sitting in\r\nmy office.\r\n\r\nI think he finally decided Dean was the one but he didn't know him. I\r\nthink it is pretty obvious that Dean, because they went in an unusual\r\nentrance to the jail from the third floor, from the chief's office, and\r\nhe says there are two guards standing on each side of him which none of\r\nthe others corroborate, unless they are talking about jail guards in\r\nthe building, but there was no police in uniform supposed to be up on\r\nthat floor but Sorrels said that he saw two police guards on each side\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nBut I asked Sorrels, I said, \"How can you account for it?\" I had\r\nalready talked to Dean. I said, \"I am getting ready to put him on the\r\nstand.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"How are you going to--what are you going to say if you go on\r\nthe stand on this?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Well, I called my office in Washington and they wanted me\r\nto find out two things: One, whether there was any connection between\r\nOswald and Ruby from Ruby, and two, whether Ruby had any confederates\r\nor co-conspirators.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Those were the two things I went to find out and I dwelled on\r\nthose entirely.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"These other officers were there and when I left they were\r\nstill questioning,\" and he said, \"I couldn't say whether that happened,\r\nI don't remember hearing it, I just can't say that I heard it,\" and so\r\nthe defense lawyers talked to Sorrels that night about testifying and\r\ndidn't use him.\r\n\r\nOf course, I thought probably they were going to use him on this one\r\nthing, but there were so many other things in the statement that were\r\nthe same as what Dean has testified to about, something about being a\r\nhero, Jew hero, or something in the statement, which Sorrels had that\r\nin his statement.\r\n\r\nHe had practically everything in the statement, but this is one thing\r\nthat he didn't have in there, as I recall.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find it and asked him about it and he said he couldn't say\r\nit. He said there were a lot of things in there but he was interested\r\nin knowing only two things.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you examine Dean's statement in regard to this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I read it there that day. It is a very short one, you\r\nknow. Of course, there is more than one statement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; did you look at his prior statements at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think I had all of his statements. He was in charge\r\nof security in the basement. All statements, this all came out on\r\ncross-examination, dealt entirely with the matter of security, what was\r\ndone to secure the basement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything in regard to this premeditation in the\r\nprior statement?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think he did, and I don't think he actually said\r\nanything about how Ruby got in in that prior statement. I may be wrong,\r\nI don't remember even going into the conversation with Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did Dean tell you at the time that you asked him about\r\nthe later statement?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He told me that he had been asked to submit a report dealing\r\nwith the security of the basement, and that that first report was the\r\nsecurity problem.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say about that, the security?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, he said that, he told me, that when he heard the shot\r\nthat he thought a policeman had shot him because he didn't think there\r\nwas anybody else in the basement. He said he thought a policeman had\r\nshot him, just got mad and the cop shot him for killing Officer Tippit.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether that was in the statement or not but he told me\r\nthat. I actually read that, that security, we were not too interested\r\nin that because from our point of view, because there is no question\r\nthe security wasn't good. Something happened somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you learn from Dean how Ruby got into the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I learned the way he told him he got in.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. On walking in on Main Street, the ramp down on Main Street.\r\nAnd I was under the impression he told a lot of other people that. But\r\nif he had been in that basement a long time it would have helped us a\r\nlot to know it. It would have shown more premeditation, but I don't\r\nthink he actually had been in long from what I know about the case.\r\n\r\nBut Ruby told Dean in his statement that he got in by going to the\r\nWestern Union and walking there and the cop was helping a car go\r\nout into it. I don't know whether that is Dean, that is somebody's\r\nstatement, that he went in that ramp and was there maybe a minute or\r\ntwo before they brought him out.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did Dean tell you why he left out of his prior statements\r\nthe statement about premeditation or prior thinking about killing\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, he was cross-examined about that, and told me also\r\nthat he wasn't asked about it. That that wasn't part of what his\r\nreport concerned. I mean, you have to keep in mind Dean is a uniformed\r\nofficer. He is sergeant, had nothing to do with the investigation of\r\nthe crime. He just happened to be the one who was sent up there to\r\nshow Sorrels how to get in the jail and out, you know. He wasn't an\r\ninvestigative officer.\r\n\r\nNow, McMillon and Archer are detectives, you know, but he is not. He is\r\na uniformed man.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did McMillon tell you about his statement?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He just told me what his testimony was. I didn't actually\r\ntalk to him over 30 minutes, I don't guess, during the noon hour and\r\nI was talking to all of them. I had the various statements he made,\r\nsome of what he said was in the statements and some wasn't, so I don't\r\nremember--but the same story was where he was and what he was supposed\r\nto do and one dealt with security and the other dealt with statement\r\nthat he had made. Dean and McMillon and any of them didn't think these\r\nstatements were admissible while he was in the jail.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did McMillon make a statement about premeditation?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. He had in his statement that he meant to shoot three times,\r\nwhich was premeditation, but I don't think he thought about it Friday\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What about Archer, did he have anything in his statement\r\nabout Friday night in his prior statements?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I don't think he did. He did have about the\r\nintending to shoot three times.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When Dean was telling you about this statement about\r\nplanning to shoot Oswald on Friday night, was he telling you that Ruby\r\nhad told him that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He didn't tell that to Sorrels?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think he said he told it to both of them. I think that the\r\nquestion on that, he said when he saw the snarl on his face he first\r\nthought about killing him. Now the snarl on his face could have been\r\nFriday night or Saturday night.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is on Oswald's face?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. On Oswald's face.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that, I am not sure of this, but I think that Sorrels\r\nremembers saying something about the snarl on his face. But I think the\r\nquestion was whether they were talking before the time of the shooting\r\nof Oswald or whether they was talking about Friday night and it is\r\nDean's impression that when he saw the snarl on his face is when he\r\nfirst thought about killing him.\r\n\r\nI don't think he ever testified he planned to kill him or anything. I\r\nthink he said that is the first time he thought about killing him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What I wanted to get clear for the Commission was whether\r\nRuby was telling this in answer to questions from Dean or in answer to\r\nquestions from Sorrels?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think largely Sorrels. I think at the end Dean asked him\r\none or two questions, mostly about how he got in, I think. I think that\r\nis what Dean was asking him about. But I think actually that this came\r\nout in the conversation while Sorrels was at least taking the lead in\r\nquestioning him.\r\n\r\nAnd I think, my recollection is at the end, as Sorrels got through and\r\nwalked on over to the elevator, he asked him how he got in the jail or\r\nsomething on that score rather than on this subject.\r\n\r\nNow, Dean is under the impression that all this came out while Sorrels\r\nwas there. But I don't think Sorrels, at least, didn't have it in his\r\nnotes and I don't think he would say it didn't happen but he didn't\r\nremember it, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you make any further investigation of this addition or\r\nchange in the statements of Dean and these other people?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't think there is any change in the statement. I think\r\nyou are asking a kind of a misleading question.\r\n\r\nI think that first report dealt entirely with the security in the\r\nbasement of the thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You don't think that purported to relate what the\r\nconversation was?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Up in the jail, I don't think, you may have it there, and I\r\nmay be wrong. I never questioned him any more because like I said from\r\nthe time of the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald I thought that Friday\r\nnight was the time, in my own mind, that is what I thought, he had\r\nthought about killing him. I don't say he said he would go arm himself,\r\nbut in my own mind I had that feeling all along and I thought it was\r\nthe first time he had thought about it, that is where I discounted\r\nall the other theories there was a connection between them because I\r\nsaw him there and talked to him, and saw his excited demeanor, and so\r\nyou asked me did I question him any more, he finally told me, what I\r\nactually thought were the facts and I do now incidentally.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have already testified that you thought it was Jack\r\nRuby before you even knew the name.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, you may--I may have stressed a little saying thought.\r\nWhen I was driving down there they said Dallas businessman kills him,\r\nwithout his name.\r\n\r\nBut in my own mind I said it must have been that Jack Ruby that was\r\ndown there the night before. I mean I was just talking to myself, there\r\nwasn't nobody there. But like I say, one of those things, I might\r\nbe more truthful to say it ran through my mind rather than to say I\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't say that to your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I didn't say it to a soul. I went down there alone. I took\r\nher home. We don't live four or five blocks and I drove downtown\r\nmyself, and it entered my mind and I will say when they announced\r\nit I wasn't too surprised. I mean I had or thought about him as a\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, did you get any assistance from the FBI, Secret\r\nService, and other agencies in the handling of these cases?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Practically none. I never have seen the Secret Service\r\nfile. This Sorrels is the only one I talked with and I saw his report\r\nalthough I never did get a copy of it. The FBI let us examine, I\r\nbelieve all their files, I am not sure, but we couldn't take possession\r\nof them and we had to send somebody up there to run through them and\r\ndictate on them, and undoubtedly they helped us some in the trial.\r\n\r\nThey helped us in this way. If you had a witness on the stand--I was\r\ncross-examining and I would say, well now, you talked to the FBI and he\r\nwould say yes, sir, and they really picked up when they knew they had\r\ntalked to the FBI and then I would say didn't you tell them this and\r\nthey would usually admit it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether the files of the--of either of\r\nthese agencies or both of them were made available to the police in\r\nconnection with the two cases?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. It is a one-way deal usually with the FBI, you know. They\r\ndon't usually tell you anything about their files but I say they did\r\nshow us their files on this, and whether they showed them to the police\r\nI have no idea.\r\n\r\nI will say they turned their files to the U.S. attorney and let me send\r\nsomebody up there to look at it, 4,500 pages of it.\r\n\r\nBut that was about a week before the trial, and during the picking of\r\nthe jury when we were still going through them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you learn anything during your investigation of the\r\nRuby case about the billfold and the ignition case in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Of Ruby's car?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That didn't come to your attention?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. You know they found a lot of stuff in his car and a lot of\r\nstuff on his person. I might say this--there are only two pieces of\r\nevidence found on him I wanted to introduce during the trial and until\r\nthis day I never have found either one of them.\r\n\r\nI don't know where they are. The police say they gave them to us, and I\r\nknow they didn't. One was the receipt from the Western Union which we\r\nnever, can't find the original of that or a copy, which I think you all\r\nhave a copy of it.\r\n\r\nThe second one was he had in his possession a \"Lifeline Deal on\r\nHeroism,\" telling about everybody had to take things into their own\r\nhands and be a hero.\r\n\r\nWe later got a copy of that because the night before the killing he\r\ngave that to the Weird Beard up at KLIF, radio station, and told him\r\nthat we had to have some heroes, that was the night before the killing.\r\n\r\nWe got a copy of what the article was but one of them, two or three\r\ncopies were in his possession but I never could find one to introduce.\r\n\r\nI never did know for sure whether to introduce it because there was a\r\nlot of good American patriotism in the thing and, of course, there is a\r\nlot of other that is complete hogwash, you know, and you don't know how\r\na jury is going to read part of it and like it and the other part not,\r\nbut the title of it was \"Heroism\" and he talked to the Weird Beard,\r\nthis was in testimony, that somebody had to be a hero.\r\n\r\nThis was the night before the killing.\r\n\r\nThis was in before, this was before the jury, and said he gave him an\r\narticle, the title of it was \"Heroism,\" that he never did read.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you supplied to the Commission all the information\r\nthat you have or has come to your attention with regard to the\r\nassassination of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know of anything. As far as I know, I have. I never\r\ndid get any information on the assassination of the President. I\r\nrequested them to send it up here to begin with.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And all you have in regard to Jack Ruby, too.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Everything I know of.\r\n\r\nLike I said I let them take those pictures of the physical evidence\r\nlast week, and there are supposed to be some things that I don't know\r\nwhere it is. It is not in my office, I think the police have lost them\r\nactually or at least they are up there and I don't think anybody is\r\ntrying to hide anything but it is just a situation there is so much\r\nthat it just got lost in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So, far as you know it has all been supplied then?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. As far as I know it has. I don't know--I know of nothing in\r\nmy files that you don't have, and if there is you sure are entitled to\r\nhave it. I am not sure about this letter you mentioned from the lawyer,\r\nthe affidavit but I am pretty sure you all have that but I know I got\r\nthat during the trial and stuck it in my desk somewhere and I don't\r\neven know where it is but it will be available.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In any of these press conferences that you have described\r\ndid you ever say anything about the type of rifle that was thought to\r\nbe involved in the killing of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think that was one of the inaccuracies that Sunday night on\r\nthe thing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say about it?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think I said I thought it was a Mauser or I thought--was\r\none of those things I didn't know what it was. It was an Italian gun, I\r\nthink and I really thought I was giving them Italian but Mauser is a\r\nGerman gun, isn't it?\r\n\r\nBut I think you have that--it was a situation, I don't contend I\r\nwas right on that because it was a situation somebody asked me that\r\nand that is what I thought I was telling them and I never--all my\r\ninformation came from the police and actually somebody said originally\r\nit was a Mauser but it turned out it was not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You learned it was not.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Oh, yes; there was no question, I am not contending whatever\r\nI said was so on that because I got it all secondhand from someone else.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you learn that the Mauser-type rifle was similar in the\r\ntype of action to the gun that was involved. Did that ever come to your\r\nattention?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think someone told me that but I am not an expert on guns.\r\nI don't believe I ever saw this gun except from a distance. I think\r\nthat Saturday night--Friday night, the 22d when they were taking it to\r\nWashington, I saw somebody take it through homicide and give it to the\r\nFBI and from a distance, I never did examine it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In your testimony you were not entirely sure as to whether\r\nChief Curry had the gun during the press conference?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; I am not. I remember seeing some officer wave that gun\r\naround. I was tying it into Chief Curry but it could have been the day\r\nbefore, because that gun actually should have still been in Washington\r\non the 23d.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I am deducting, I think probably that I saw someone else with\r\nthe gun, rather than Chief Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you in any press conference describe anything about\r\nparaffin tests?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I told them they gave him paraffin tests. I believe that--I\r\nam not positive what I told them, but what I was told, they found\r\nparaffin on one hand--powder showed positive on one hand. I don't know\r\nwhich one, but I remember the police told me the paraffin test was\r\npositive on one hand. I don't know which hand.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you indicate what that meant in terms of the effect on\r\ncrime or its investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, of course, it meant that a man had fired a gun if they\r\nfind powder on his hands. I assume I have told them that. I think\r\nthat was Sunday night when we were laying out the evidence, so far as\r\nI know. I don't think that was prior to his being killed. It was, it\r\nshouldn't have been done, but I think that was Friday night.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Dulles has a few\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles, do you have some questions you would like to\r\nask Mr. Wade?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Ford, believing I was the only one\r\ngoing to be here during the interrogation--during the entire session\r\nthis morning--gave me a few questions and asked me to tell you he was\r\nvery sorry he could not be here today, but he will be here tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A great many of these questions have already been covered.\r\nI will just run over them briefly.\r\n\r\nYou have testified as to a telephone call that the attorney general\r\nreceived from Washington, what he told you about that. Did you have\r\nanything further to add to that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; I believe we have covered that all right. I\r\nwas trying to think. In the course of this thing, during all this\r\ninvestigation, I have talked to Cliff Carter in the White House, or at\r\nleast he used to be, but I don't think we talked then on it. I think it\r\nwas later, the next day, and then 2 or 3 days later, as I recall, but\r\nI believe right after they got back to Washington, I got a call from\r\nCliff Carter wondering whether they had the person, or something, but\r\nCliff was one of President Johnson's aides.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. And I have talked with him later, I think, on, I don't know,\r\nI don't think it concerned any of these problems, but I am just talking\r\nout loud with you, but we have covered that fully and, I believe, the\r\nattorney general told you that he had talked to somebody in the White\r\nHouse about it and called me, I think that is where he told me where he\r\nhad----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There were no other messages other than these messages that\r\nyou mentioned with Cliff Carter, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes; I talked to him, but I don't think it concerned this\r\nproblem. I think it was on a--as a matter of fact, I think it was after\r\nRuby had shot Oswald when I talked to him, but it is one of those\r\nthings I can't remember. I hope you don't think I am trying not to tell\r\nyou, I don't mind telling you anything, but talking to you that I got\r\na call every 5 minutes, and so I don't know, mostly the press calling,\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was the conduct of the investigation of the assassination\r\nhindered by any possible overlapping of jurisdiction between Federal,\r\nState, and local authorities? You have dealt with that in a general\r\nway. Do you have anything more to say on that point?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Well, I think the investigation of the assassination was\r\ncarried on in a rather cooperative manner between all the agencies\r\nconcerned. I think this cooperation was more than generally you would\r\nhave. It was born out of a feeling that all the agencies were to some\r\nextent on the spot, I think, your FBI, your Secret Service. I think\r\nthat bred cooperation rather than antagonism. I don't know of any\r\nantagonism. I think the biggest fault with the investigation was your\r\npress and television.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any question that you people up here deal with\r\nit. But you take a chief of police, a little chief of police, or a\r\nlittle district attorney down there who is not used to having all,\r\neverybody, calling you all hours of the night and asking you questions,\r\nand then if you sneeze, write a front page story about what you said,\r\nwith no way to deny it, you know, and I think the press was the biggest\r\nthing that caused--I don't think they ever ought to have been in the\r\npolice department to begin with. I would have liked to have kept them\r\nout of the courtroom. The judge announced that he was going to have\r\nthem in the courtroom, but I was instrumental in keeping them out.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When we were in Dallas, it was suggested to us that the\r\npress, radio, and news media kind of took possession of city hall\r\nthere, and it was a question of throwing them out by force of arms or\r\nleaving them there. Do you have any comment on that?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know how they got in. I don't see how they could\r\nrun those big cables right through the chief of police's office there\r\nwithout somebody giving them permission. However, I have no way of\r\nknowing how they got in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was suggested to us that the chief of police was out at\r\nthe airport and did not get back, and found them in there when he got\r\nback at 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. How they got in I have no idea, but the whole mechanics of\r\nthe thing--for instance, in the homicide office, the whole office--you\r\nprobably have seen it--I don't imagine it is as big as this room. It is\r\ncut up into little offices.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was in there; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. If you know, when I went into the office, went into that\r\noffice there Friday night, you had to push people back to open the door\r\nto get out. You had police having to move the crowd, and they were just\r\nstacked down that corridor, and it was a situation that should not have\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nOf course, you have a situation where the press yell that the American\r\npeople have a right to know their President had been assassinated. I\r\ndon't say there are not two sides to the situation, but I think when\r\nthey get to interfering with the processes of law there is bound to be\r\na middle ground or some way to work it out. I can't solve it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So far as you know, have all documents of any evidence,\r\nof any kind whatsoever, collected by State and local authorities in\r\nTexas been turned over to the Federal authorities and the President's\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. So far as I know they have. We have either sent it to the\r\nCommission or to Mr. Waggoner Carr, and I assume whatever he gets\r\nhe sends to you all. I don't know of any documents; I don't know\r\nwhether--you don't have a transcript of the trial, but that will be\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How long was the transcript, Mr. Wade?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know how many pages. I don't think--we don't have\r\nour copy of it. We ordered a copy, and so--he filed a pauper's oath,\r\nso I don't have any idea how long it will be. It was about 2 weeks of\r\ntestimony, an argument, and also 2 weeks of picking the jury. They took\r\nall that down, all questioning of prospective jurors, so all that will\r\nbe in the transcript.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will that all be in the record on appeal?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have they made any extra copies, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I know they are making some extra copies that have been\r\nbought by individuals, I believe Life magazine, some of those magazines\r\nhave ordered a copy.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. We are having to pay for ours. We are having to pay for ours,\r\nand, of course, we will handle that, we will use that when briefing our\r\ncase on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you know what it will cost? You don't know that yet?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I think--we think--our copy will be $3,000. I mean I have got\r\nthat figure in my mind, because the Commissioners' Court kicked about\r\nus having to pay court reporters who are working for the county, but I\r\nthink the court reporters wrote the law, but I have got in mind $3,000,\r\nbut that is a copy. The original usually is twice that much, but of\r\ncourse, a copy is all you would want. But you can write Mr. Jimmy\r\nMuleady. He is the official court reporter of that court.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You have testified with regard to the Hudkins and Goulden\r\nrumors that the FBI or CIA or some other Federal agency might have\r\nemployed Oswald. One or the other of those correspondents indicated\r\nthat he got his information from some high official that he refused to\r\nidentify--he or they--refused to identify. Do you know anything about\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No; Hudkins, as I recall, wrote in his article--I don't know\r\nwho the high official is, but I imagine they are basing it on me or\r\nthe police or someone--Hudkins put in his article, you know he wrote\r\nall this stuff, he is a wild writer, and he said, \"Henry Wade said he\r\ndoubted whether it would be public information\" or something.\r\n\r\nWell, he came running into me one day there and said, \"Now, I have got\r\nall kinds of evidence that he is working for the FBI.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Well, fine, I have none myself,\" and he said, \"What would\r\nyou think about it?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Well, you are getting onto a situation that I don't know\r\nwhether it ought to be public information or not.\" I mean, I asked,\r\nsuppose he did, I don't know whether it would be something that ought\r\nto be written or not, well, more or less trying to get him not to write\r\nthe article, and I said, \"Assuming it is so, I don't see you are doing\r\nany good writing it.\"\r\n\r\nSo he quoted from that. That is all the conversation I had with\r\nHudkins, and you can get that--I haven't seen the Goulden article, and\r\ndidn't talk with him. I haven't seen Joe Goulden--I assume it is Joe\r\nGoulden. He left Dallas and went with a Philadelphia paper. So if it is\r\nthe situation, if I have seen it I don't remember anything about it, if\r\nhe wrote a story.\r\n\r\nBut the high official, all I can tell you anything on that, I have\r\nabsolutely no evidence myself or any personal knowledge that he worked\r\nfor the FBI or any Federal agency, and the only thing I have heard are\r\nrumors on the subject, and none of them that has got anything to base\r\nit on that I know of.\r\n\r\nDoes that cover that?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That covers that.\r\n\r\nYou referred to the statement attributed to you made prior to Oswald's\r\nkilling that the case against him was closed. I understand you say that\r\nwas not correct, you did not make that statement.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. That is right. To the best of my knowledge, I never said\r\nthat. I mean that is what burned me up more than anything, more than\r\nany other statement on television when I saw it. I had not been on\r\ntelevision. They have written this in the Dallas papers and some woman\r\nwrote in and said she saw me say it on television. But I would like to\r\nsee a picture of it because the case never had actually been opened as\r\nfar as--I mean, we weren't investigating the case. I think that night\r\nI told them, of course he is dead, there is no way of trying him. But\r\nthe purpose, one other purpose in that interview Sunday night was to\r\npoint out that I am sure the agencies will go on investigating it for\r\nthe benefit of posterity, and I actually, if not in that interview,\r\nthe following day, said I agreed with some Congressmen who said they\r\nthought they ought to have a Federal investigation on a national level\r\nof this thing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether any other Texas officials made any such\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I don't know whether anybody did. They quoted the chief of\r\npolice. They quoted Fritz on it, and then they started quoting me on\r\nit, which is all saying that. But so far, to the best of my knowledge,\r\nI never told anybody the case was closed, and I really think that Fritz\r\nmust have said something about it, and then people think the captain\r\nof detectives and the district attorney and the chief are all about\r\nthe same, and it finally drifted over to me because I left the police\r\nstation and never had a word to say until that night when I was on\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether there were any official transcripts\r\nmade of the various interrogations of Oswald from the time he was\r\ncaptured to the time of his killing?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. If there are any, I have never seen them. I have asked\r\nfor them, but you are dealing with a man who not only doesn't make\r\ntranscripts, but doesn't even make notes. Captain Fritz is the one who\r\ninterrogated him most of the time, and if you--if there is any written\r\nevidence of what he said it must be from the FBI or the Secret Service\r\nor someone who interviewed him. I assume they make a record of what he\r\nsaid to them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. If any transcript was made we would have had it, would we\r\nnot? So far as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. The only thing I know I never have seen one, and I don't have\r\none of an interview, and I don't know of any--you should have it, but\r\nyou are dealing with Fritz there who interviewed Ruby, and Melvin Belli\r\nwent right into the conversation with Ruby, and Belli at 4 o'clock that\r\nafternoon made everything admissible, and we couldn't get a thing,\r\ncouldn't put Fritz on the stand because he couldn't remember anything\r\nthat was helpful. I mean, he could remember Ruby rambling around the\r\nsituation, but I don't know of any transcript like that that I have\r\nthat you don't have.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In your talks, going back to your talks, with Mr. Carter at\r\nthe White House----\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. Carter; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Carter--did any questions come up in these conversations\r\nabout not raising the issue that he was a Communist or that there might\r\nbe a conspiracy or something of that kind?\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. No, sir; that conversation, I'm rather sure sometime Friday\r\nafternoon, and he called me and said, \"Are they making any progress on\r\nthe case?\" You see, Cliff Carter and I are close personal friends. I\r\nhave known him, and they were all upset, and I said, \"I don't know. I\r\nhave heard they have got some pretty good evidence.\" I think that is\r\nthe only conversation I had with him.\r\n\r\nSomebody told me, Mr. Carr, I believe, or Barefoot Sanders, that\r\nthey had had some conversations with some Washington officials, and\r\nI have got an impression it was the State Department, but it might\r\nhave been--that they--concerning the international conspiracy angle. I\r\ndidn't discuss it because it was silly, I mean the whole thing was a\r\nsilly deal.\r\n\r\nI mean, if you would prove he was a Communist, suppose he gave a\r\nstatement he was a Communist, I wouldn't have put that in a murder\r\ncharge because I had to prove it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that is all, Mr. Wade. Thank you very much for\r\nyour cooperation.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE. I appreciate what you all are doing and your problems you\r\nhave got up here. I know if I were in your place I would hate to listen\r\nto somebody like me talk 5 hours.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right. We will recess until 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF PATRICK T. DEAN\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.\r\n\r\n(Chairman Warren presiding and Mr. Dulles present.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nDo you have a statement?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Sergeant Dean asked if he couldn't appear before the\r\nCommission and testify. We took his deposition in Dallas, and he asked,\r\nwhen he signed his deposition, whether he couldn't appear personally,\r\nso we are permitting him to do this.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We are very happy to have you, Sergeant. Will you raise\r\nyour right hand and be sworn, please?\r\n\r\nYou solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin, you may examine the witness.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Sergeant, will you give us your name, your address, please?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Patrick T. Dean. I live at 2822 Nicholson Drive in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you connected with the police department in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What is your position?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. I am a sergeant on patrol.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you been an official in the police department?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Eleven and a half years.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us briefly any training or experience you\r\nhave had?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Well, I worked as a patrolman for 5 years. Then I was\r\npromoted to sergeant and remained in the patrol division. I have since\r\nbeen in the patrol division the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have given us your deposition, have you not, Sergeant?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And is that correct and true as far as anything you know?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there any part of it that you want to change or correct\r\nor modify?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. No, sir; I feel the main reason I wanted to appear before\r\nthe Commission was about the 20 or 25 minutes that was off the record\r\nthat I feel I would like the Commission to have on the record, and this\r\nis between Mr. Griffin and I. He was the original one who started my\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well, do you want to tell that at this time?\r\n\r\nFirst, is there anything about what you said on the record that was not\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the truth?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Griffin had questioned me about 2 hours, or maybe a little\r\nlonger. There was no problems at all, no difficulties. And after that\r\nlength of time, a little over 2 hours, Mr. Griffin desired to get off\r\nthe record, and he advised the court reporter that he would be off the\r\nrecord and he could go smoke a cigarette or get a Coke, and he would\r\nlet him know when he wanted him to get back on the record.\r\n\r\nWell, after the court reporter left, Mr. Griffin started talking to me\r\nin a manner of gaining my confidence in that he would help me and that\r\nhe felt I would probably need some help in the future.\r\n\r\nMy not knowing what he was building up to, I asked Mr. Griffin to go\r\nahead and ask me what he was going to ask me. He continued to advise\r\nme that he wanted me to listen to what he had to say before he asked\r\nme whatever question he was going to ask me. I finally told him that\r\nwhatever he wanted to ask me he could just ask me, and if I knew I\r\nwould tell him the truth or if I didn't know, I would tell him I didn't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. Griffin took my reports, one dated February 18, the subject of it\r\nwas an interview with Jack Ruby, and one dated November 26, which was\r\nmy assignment in the basement.\r\n\r\nHe said there were things in these statements which were not true and,\r\nin fact, he said both these statements, he said there were particular\r\nthings in there that were not true, and I asked him what portions did\r\nhe consider not true, and then very dogmatically he said that, \"Jack\r\nRuby didn't tell you that he entered the basement via the Main Street\r\nramp.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, I was shocked at this. This is what I testified to, in\r\nfact, I was cross-examined on this, and he, Mr. Griffin, further said,\r\n\"Jack Ruby did not tell you that he had thought or planned to kill\r\nOswald two nights prior.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Your testimony was false, and these reports to your chief\r\nof police are false.\"\r\n\r\nSo this, of course, all this was off the record. I told Mr. Griffin\r\nthen this shocked me, and I told him it shocked me; that I couldn't\r\nimagine what he was getting at or why he would accuse me of this, and I\r\nasked him, and Mr. Griffin replied he didn't or he wasn't at liberty to\r\ndiscuss that particular part of it with me, and that he wasn't trying\r\nto cross-examine me here, but that under cross-examination he could\r\nprove that my testimony was false, and that is when I told Mr. Griffin\r\nthat these are the facts and I can't change them. This is what I know\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nI quoted Ruby just about verbatim, and since he didn't believe me, and\r\nI was saying they were true, we might as well terminate the interview.\r\n\r\nMr. Griffin then got back on the record, or before he did get back\r\non the record, he said, \"Well now, Sergeant Dean, I respect you as a\r\nwitness, I respect you in your profession, but I have offered my help\r\nand assistance, and I again will offer you my assistance, and that I\r\ndon't feel you will be subjecting yourself to loss of your job,\" or\r\nsome words to that effect, \"If you will go ahead and tell me the truth\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nI again told Mr. Griffin that these were the facts and I couldn't\r\nchange them, so with that we got back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ask Mr. Griffin to ever put this part that was off\r\nthe record on the record?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why didn't you at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Well, now the discussion was, I said, \"Mr. Griffin, I have\r\nwaived my rights for an attorney, of which I don't feel like I need\r\none.\" I still don't feel like I need one.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And you do not need one either Sergeant.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. True.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You will get along all right.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI said, \"I have come over here with the idea of giving you all the\r\ninformation that I have.\" In fact, I had some additional information\r\nthat I had gotten the night before, and it was a call that I had\r\nreceived from some man in Victoria, Canada, who said he had a reel of\r\nmovie film that he had taken of the assassination.\r\n\r\nI got this man's name, where he called from, had the police department\r\nin Victoria check to crisscross the number, and I gave him the\r\nname--well, all the information as to where the call had originated\r\nfrom, his name, also this man's attorney, he had given me his name, and\r\nI told him that the reason the man had called, had called especially\r\nfor me at the police department, was that he had a reel of movie film\r\nthat he had taken the day of the assassination and that these--or the\r\ncamera was on the President at the time of the assassination, and he\r\ndescribed to me the position as to where he was, which was across and\r\nin trajectory of the line of fire, and that he felt that in addition to\r\nthe assassination that he had gotten the School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Griffin at the time that I had told this man--I can't\r\nremember his name, the FBI has gotten it, and at the time I gave it\r\nto Mr. Griffin, I told this man on the telephone from Victoria that\r\nnight that he should send these things, this film, that he said wasn't\r\ndeveloped, to the Warren Commission.\r\n\r\nHe said, that is when he told me that he had contacted his attorney in\r\nVictoria and that his attorney's name was Batter, and he spelled it\r\nfor me, B-a-t-t-e-r, and his attorney had advised him not to send this\r\ninformation to the Warren Commission but to contact someone in Dallas\r\nand send it to them.\r\n\r\nThis man told me that he had read something about my testimony and\r\nthat he asked me would it be all right for him to send it to me, and\r\nI told him, \"Yes,\" and I said I was supposed to go back to the Warren\r\nCommission and he could send it to me, and I would make it available\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThis was just additional information that I told Mr. Griffin that I\r\nwas--this is an example--I was there to help them in any way I could.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, the differences in your testimony that Mr. Griffin was\r\ndiscussing with you off the record, you have gone into that in detail\r\non the record, haven't you, in your deposition?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes; I believe I have, about how Ruby entered the basement or\r\nhow he told me how he entered the basement. Also that he had thought\r\ntwo nights prior when he saw Lee Oswald on a showup stand with a\r\nsarcastic sneer on his face is when he decided if he got the chance he\r\nwould kill him. This was the thing that I testified in court about. I\r\nwas cross-examined in court.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you have explained all that in your deposition, haven't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. I believe so; I am not certain.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did he ask you about why you didn't have your--this\r\ninformation about his planning to shoot Oswald the night before, or on\r\nthe Friday----\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Now, are you asking did Mr. Griffin ask me why I didn't----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why you didn't put it in your February--in your statement\r\nbefore the February 18 one?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir; I believe he did, and I explained to him this\r\nwasn't the subject--the subject of that November 26 report was my\r\nassignment. I didn't put any of the conversation as to what Mr. Sorrels\r\nand I talked to Mr. Ruby about. I did put at the closing paragraph, I\r\nthink, and I have a copy of it here, that my main concern was how he\r\ngot into the basement and how long he had been there because I was in\r\ncharge of the security of the basement.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So you didn't put it in your prior reports?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. No, sir; this was later on. Chief Curry--I think probably it\r\nwas February 18--and I think I probably wrote it that day, called me\r\nto his office and asked me had I heard all the interview of Ruby and\r\nSorrels, and I told him that I did, and he asked me could I remember\r\nit pretty well, and I said, \"Yes, I believe I can remember most all of\r\nit,\" and that is when Chief Curry told me that, he said, \"Well, you are\r\ngoing to have to testify to it because Mr. Sorrels can't because he\r\nsays he didn't warn Mr. Ruby when he was questioning him.\r\n\r\nWell, this was fine with me. I wrote the report. This was February 18.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you tell Mr. Griffin at that time that you thought it\r\nwas unimportant or had some other reason for not including it?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. I believe that I told him that the investigation, the focal\r\npoint, was as to how he got into the basement. There was an officer,\r\nand I knew who the officer was, I assigned him there myself, and I\r\nfelt this was more of a part of the investigation in which it was\r\ninvestigated--Officer R. E. Vaughan was investigated as to whether or\r\nnot he let Ruby into the basement or saw him in the basement, and, of\r\ncourse, he was cleared of this. I know of no--the only information\r\nI passed on about that was when Jack Ruby told me how he entered. I\r\ntold my superiors and then they carried it on from there as far as the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And about his planning to shoot him prior to the day\r\nthat----\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Now, this wasn't--the only time that I put that in the report\r\nwas February 18.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; did you explain to Mr. Griffin in your prior testimony\r\nwhy you didn't put it in?\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. I believe that I did; I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you want to add anything to that, just anything that you\r\nwanted, to the Commission?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you recall whether you were asked that specific\r\nquestion or not, Sergeant? May I ask, Mr. Rankin, was he asked that\r\nquestion, and did he answer it?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I have to look at the record to be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, in answer to your question, he was asked about what\r\nwas the first time that he had given this information and if this was\r\nthe date. He was not asked for any explanation as to why he didn't give\r\nit at any earlier time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Then we can't blame him if he didn't answer why.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No; I just wanted to find out if he wanted to add anything\r\nat this time that would complete the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; all right.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Well, my main concern has been in some way this got out to\r\nthe papers. The only thing I told the papers was that I can't give any\r\nstatement. I said I have no comment, and I feel that the accusation\r\nstarted with my denial because I haven't had an opportunity to deny it.\r\nThe story came out in the papers and it has been on the radio several\r\ntimes, and, in fact, several times since the original, some weeks or so\r\nafter the paper learned of it of the so-called rift, as they put it.\r\n\r\nThey had the one side of it that he accused me of lying. He didn't use\r\nthe word \"lie,\" he just said, \"These are false statements, and when\r\nyou testified in court you testified falsely.\" He didn't use the word\r\n\"lying,\" and a lot of papers have since then used the word \"lying.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like the accusation is a lot stronger than my denial because\r\nI haven't denied it. I haven't made any statement at all to press or\r\nradio or any news media. I just told them it will have to come from the\r\nWarren Commission or some other source.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What I was asking, Sergeant, was whether there is anything\r\nthat you would like to tell the Commission or add to your testimony\r\nabout why it wasn't in the earlier statement prior to February 18 that\r\nyou haven't already told us.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Well, I don't think I would like--if I could, I would like\r\nto know why Mr. Griffin had accused me of perjury. Of course, this is\r\nsomething for you people to know, but I just--he wouldn't discuss it\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Sergeant, I want to say to you that, of course,\r\nwithout knowing what your conversation was with Mr. Griffin, I have\r\nnever talked to Mr. Griffin about this. I didn't know that you had\r\nthis altercation with him, but I want to say this: That so far as\r\nthe jurisdiction of this Commission is concerned and its procedures,\r\nno member of our staff has a right to tell any witness that he is\r\nlying or that he is testifying falsely. That is not his business. It\r\nis the business of this Commission to appraise the testimony of all\r\nthe witnesses, and, at the time you are talking about, and up to the\r\npresent time, this Commission has never appraised your testimony or\r\nfully appraised the testimony of any other witness, and furthermore, I\r\nwant to say to you that no member of our staff has any power to help or\r\ninjure any witness.\r\n\r\nSo, so far as that conversation is concerned, there is nothing that\r\nwill be binding upon this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But, as I say, I don't know what your conversation was\r\nwith Griffin, but I am just telling you as to what the limitations of\r\nthe members of our staff are.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Yes, sir; thank you. That is about all I had.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you, Sergeant, for coming and feeling as you\r\ndo, I am glad you had the frankness to come and talk to the Commission,\r\nand offer to testify concerning it.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, Sergeant.\r\n\r\nMr. DEAN. Thank you. It is nice to have met you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Waggoner, do you want to take the stand for a minute about\r\nthat conversation?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You are going to ask the General about it?\r\n\r\nHave you been sworn?\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WAGGONER CARR\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated, please.\r\n\r\nProceed, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Carr, will you state your name and position for the\r\nrecord?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. I am Waggoner Carr, attorney general of the State of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are a practicing lawyer, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Yes, sir; before I was elected, I was practicing law in\r\nLubbock, Tex. Now, of course, being attorney general, this has taken me\r\nout of the private practice. Prior to that I graduated from law school\r\nat the University of Texas, had my pre-law with a BBA degree from Texas\r\nTech. I have been an assistant district attorney for the 72nd judicial\r\ndistrict in Texas; county attorney of Lubbock County for 2 years;\r\nserved in the Texas House of Representatives for 10 years, the last 4\r\nof those years being as Speaker of the House, and was elected attorney\r\ngeneral in 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You are the same Waggoner Carr who has participated from\r\ntime to time in observing these hearings and cooperating with the\r\nCommission regarding its work?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Insofar as the State of Texas is concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were you here when Henry Wade was testifying with regard to\r\na conversation between himself and yourself, this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you relate to us that conversation as you recall it,\r\nboth what you said and what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. As I recall, it was around 8 or 9 o'clock at night on\r\nNovember 22, 1963, when I received a long-distance telephone call from\r\nWashington from someone in the White House. I can't for the life of me\r\nremember who it was.\r\n\r\nA rumor had been heard here that there was going to be an allegation\r\nin the indictment against Oswald connecting the assassination with an\r\ninternational conspiracy, and the inquiry was made whether I had any\r\nknowledge of it, and I told him I had no knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I hadn't been in Dallas since the assassination\r\nand was not there at the time of the assassination.\r\n\r\nSo the request was made of me to contact Mr. Wade to find out if that\r\nallegation was in the indictment.\r\n\r\nI received the definite impression that the concern of the caller was\r\nthat because of the emotion or the high tension that existed at that\r\ntime that someone might thoughtlessly place in the indictment such an\r\nallegation without having the proof of such a conspiracy. So I did\r\ncall Mr. Wade from my home, when I received the call, and he told me\r\nvery much what he repeated to you today, as I recall, that he had no\r\nknowledge of anyone desiring to have that or planning to have that\r\nin the indictment; that it would be surplusage, it was not necessary\r\nto allege it, and that it would not be in there, but that he would\r\ndoublecheck it to be sure.\r\n\r\nAnd then I called back, and--as I recall I did--and informed the White\r\nHouse participant in the conversation of what Mr. Wade had said, and\r\nthat was all of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was there anything said to you at any time by anybody from\r\nWashington that if there was any evidence that was credible to support\r\nsuch an international conspiracy it should not be included in the\r\nindictment or complaint or any action?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Oh, no; absolutely not. There was no direct talk or indirect\r\ntalk or insinuation that the facts, whatever they might be, should\r\nbe suppressed. It was simply that in the tension someone might put\r\nsomething in an indictment for an advantage here or disadvantage there,\r\nthat could not be proved, which would have very serious reaction, which\r\nthe local person might not anticipate since he might not have the\r\nentire picture of what the reaction might be.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Attorney General, I don't know whether you will be\r\ntestifying on any other subject before the Commission or not, but\r\nin the event that you do not, and both of us are not here in the\r\nCommission again at the same time, I want to say to you for the record\r\nthat from the very beginning of our investigation your cooperation has\r\nbeen complete, it has been enthusiastic, and it has been most helpful\r\nto the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Commission and I all appreciate it very much indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Well, thank you, sir. I will say this, that it has been a\r\nvery pleasant experience for us, and I think set a good example of how\r\na State government and a Federal Government can cooperate together\r\nwhere we have common objectives such as this, where we are trying to\r\ndetermine the facts and nothing else.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I add my voice to that, Mr. Chief Justice?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; indeed, you may.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I know that has been true as far as I am personally\r\nconcerned, and during our trip to Dallas, Mr. Carr was of great help to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nCould I ask just one question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was there any indication in the call from the White House\r\nas to whether this was a leftist, rightist, or any other type of\r\nconspiracy or, as far as you recall, was just the word \"conspiracy\"\r\nused?\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. As far as I recall, it was an international conspiracy. This\r\nwas the idea, but I don't know whether the word \"Communist\" was used or\r\nnot, Mr. Dulles. It could have been, or maybe I just assumed that if\r\nthere was a conspiracy it would only be a Communist conspiracy. I don't\r\nknow which it was, but it was a perfectly natural call.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances that existed at the time, knowing them as I did, and\r\nthe tension and the high emotion that was running rampant there, it was\r\nnot inconceivable that something like that could have been done, you\r\nunderstand, without any thought of harming anyone or any thought of\r\nhaving to prove it, as long as you didn't know that under our Texas law\r\nyou have to prove every allegation made in an indictment. If you didn't\r\nknow that, it might seem logical that someone might put something like\r\nthat into an indictment, factual or not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. But there was no such thing going on.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, General, I think that will be all then. Thank you\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nMr. CARR. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission is adjourned.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 2:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, June 9, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RICHARD EDWARD SNYDER, JOHN A. McVICKAR, AND ABRAM CHAYES\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 10 a.m., on June 9, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald Ford, and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were William T. Coleman, Jr., assistant counsel; W. David\r\nSlawson, assistant counsel; Charles Murray, observer; and Dean Robert\r\nG. Storey, special counsel to the attorney general of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RICHARD EDWARD SNYDER\r\n\r\n(Members present at this point: Chief Justice Warren, and Mr. Dulles.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, the Commission will come to order. Mr.\r\nColeman, would you make a statement as to the purpose of the meeting\r\nthis morning?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, the first witness is Mr. Richard E.\r\nSnyder, who is presently first secretary in the American Embassy in\r\nTokyo, Japan, and was second secretary and consul, American Embassy,\r\nMoscow, U.S.S.R., in 1959, and remained in that post in Moscow through\r\nat least the middle of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. Snyder will be asked to testify concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's\r\nactions when he came into the American Embassy in Moscow on October 31,\r\n1959, and stated that he desired to renounce his U.S. citizenship, the\r\nactions which the Embassy took at that time, and the information which\r\nit gave to the State Department.\r\n\r\nMr. Snyder also handled the interview of Oswald when he appeared at the\r\nEmbassy in July of 1961, and had his passport returned to him, and will\r\nbe asked to testify about the return of the passport.\r\n\r\nMr. Snyder will also be asked to identify for the record the various\r\nEmbassy dispatches and State Department instructions which were\r\nexchanged concerning Oswald in 1959, 1960, and to the middle of 1961.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Snyder, it is customary for us to read a statement of\r\nthat kind to the witness, so you will be apprised of what we are going\r\nto interview you about.\r\n\r\nWill you please rise and raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthis Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleman will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, will you state your name for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Richard Edward Snyder.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And what is your present address?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. 118 Geary Drive, South Plainfield, N.J.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Are you presently employed by the Federal Government?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In what capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. As a Foreign Service officer of the Department of State.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Where are you presently stationed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. In Tokyo, American Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Directing your attention to the fall of 1959, were you\r\nemployed by the Federal Government at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Where were you stationed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. At the Embassy in Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What was your title?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Second secretary and consul, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it that you have had called to your attention a\r\ncopy of the joint resolution which was adopted by Congress with respect\r\nto the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And I also take it that since you have been back in the\r\ncountry that you have had an opportunity to look at the various State\r\nDepartment files dealing with Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Calling your attention to the date of October 31----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question, Mr. Coleman, about that? What\r\nprevious posts had you had before going to Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, my first post in the Foreign Service----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am interested as an old Foreign Service officer.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I see. I served for a brief time in HICOG in Frankfurt,\r\nGermany and then for about 2 years in Munich, in the consulate general,\r\nwhich was my first post in the Foreign Service.\r\n\r\nMy second post, I spent 1 year in the boondocks of Japan, in Niigata,\r\non the Sea of Japan, in a one-man cultural center.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As a Foreign Service officer?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. As a Foreign Service officer; yes, sir. I was assigned to\r\nthis duty at a time when USIS was still part of the State Department,\r\nand when I reached my post it had already been separated, so I was on\r\nloan to them. And then a year and a half in Tokyo. Then a summer and\r\nan academic year at Harvard, in Russian area studies.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In what school there?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. In Littauer.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you learn Russian at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I had had Russian in college before.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So you speak Russian fairly fluently?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Fairly fluently; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And then Moscow was your next post?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. And then Moscow for 2 years; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What 2 years?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. July of 1959 to July of 1961. I arrived there just before\r\nthe Vice President.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Directing your attention, sir, to October 31, 1959, did\r\nyou have occasion to see Lee Harvey Oswald on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Had you ever seen him before?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Had you ever heard about him before?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you state for the Commission just what happened when\r\nyou saw Mr. Oswald on October 31. 1959, indicating the time of day,\r\nwhat he said, and what you did?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Before you answer that question, may I say that this is\r\nCongressman Ford, a member of the Commission.\r\n\r\nThis is Mr. Snyder of the State Department now stationed in Tokyo, and\r\nwho was stationed at the Embassy in Moscow when Oswald attempted to\r\ndefect.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, as for the time of day, I am afraid I draw a blank.\r\nI can make some assumptions as to the time of day, for what they are\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nBut since I told Oswald--and you will come to this, I think, a little\r\nlater on--that the Embassy was closed theoretically at the time, I\r\npresume this was a Wednesday afternoon or perhaps a Saturday afternoon,\r\nbut I just don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. For the record, I think it was a Saturday, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Was it a Saturday?\r\n\r\nSo, at any rate--if it had been a morning, I could not have used this\r\nparticular approach with him. So I presume it was an afternoon.\r\n\r\nOswald came into the Embassy without prior announcement. He didn't call\r\nor in any other way communicate with us, to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You had no way of knowing he was in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I had no previous knowledge of his presence; no, sir.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he came in to me cold, so to speak. I was told that an\r\nAmerican wanted to see me, wanted to see the consul. And I am not sure\r\nwhether I went out and brought him in or whether he was taken into my\r\noffice by someone else. At any rate, this was my first meeting with\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nI will be glad to give you such recollections as I have as to his\r\ngeneral demeanor and this sort of thing, if you would like.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. And I might inject at this point something which I\r\nmentioned to Mr. Slawson before our session began, and that is that\r\nI reviewed the files, our own files, on Oswald, enough to refresh my\r\nmemory as to the basic facts and the chronology of events and this sort\r\nof thing, but I have attempted not to go too deeply into details with\r\nthe thought that what the Commission is interested in, presumably, is\r\nwhat I honestly remember at the time and not so much what may have been\r\nplanted in my mind by reviews since that time.\r\n\r\nAs to his general appearance, I do recall that he was neatly and very\r\npresentably dressed. I couldn't say offhand whether he was dressed\r\nin a suit and shirt, though I think probably he was. At any rate, he\r\npresented a nice physical appearance.\r\n\r\nI presume that he was well shaven. Otherwise, I would not have had this\r\nfeeling about him--that he, in general, was competent looking.\r\n\r\nHe was extremely sure of himself. He seemed to know what his mission\r\nwas. He took charge, in a sense, of the conversation right from the\r\nbeginning. He told me in effect that he was there to give up his\r\nAmerican citizenship. I believe he put his passport on my desk, but\r\nI am not sure. I may have asked for it. In general, his attitude was\r\nquite arrogant.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there? When you say you presume\r\nyou asked for it, you mean you asked to see it--you didn't ask to take\r\nit from him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, I asked to see it. If he didn't put it on the desk,\r\nthen I asked for it early in the game--one way or the other.\r\n\r\nHe told me, among other things, that he had come to the Soviet Union\r\nto live, that he did not intend to go back to the United States, that\r\nthis was a well thought out idea on his part. He said, again in effect,\r\n\"Don't bother wasting my time asking me questions or trying to talk me\r\nout of my position.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I am well aware\"--either he said, \"I am well aware\" or \"I\r\nhave been told exactly the kind of thing you will ask me, and I am not\r\ninterested, so let's get down to business\"--words to that effect.\r\n\r\nWell, he was a very cocksure young man at that time.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that he sat at all throughout the interview, but\r\ncertainly in the early part of it he did not.\r\n\r\nI asked him--I recall asking him to take a seat, and he said, no, he\r\nwanted to stand. He may have relented later on.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I did nevertheless probe about and elicited a bit of\r\ninformation about him which was in my report to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, was anyone else present at the time you were talking\r\nto Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I believe Mr. McVickar was in the next room. But there\r\nwas no one in the room with us at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How long did the interview with Mr. Oswald last,\r\napproximately?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, I would have to pull it out of the air, really. It\r\nwould be on the order of magnitude of half an hour. It might have\r\nextended to three-quarters of an hour, something of this sort.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Other than the passport, did he give you any other piece\r\nof paper?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, yes; he did. He gave me a written statement saying\r\nsomething along the line of what I have said he mentioned to me orally.\r\nThat is, that he had come to the Soviet Union to live, that he desired\r\nto renounce his citizenship, that he was going to become a citizen of\r\nthe Soviet Union, words to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We have that written statement, do we not?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 913 a photostatic\r\ncopy of a handwritten letter which is signed by Lee H. Oswald, and\r\nask you whether that is a copy of the letter that Oswald gave you on\r\nOctober 31, when he appeared at the Embassy?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 913 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I would say it is, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After he gave you the letter and the passport, did he do\r\nanything else?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; after his initial statement of purpose and intent, and\r\nafter giving me this statement, the interview was then pretty much in\r\nmy hands. He was, I would say, a reluctant interviewee from there on.\r\n\r\nHe had announced initially his desire not to discuss the matter with\r\nme, but simply to get on with the business for which he had come and,\r\ntherefore, anything else that was to be said was up to me to get said.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you at that time go through whatever formalities are\r\nrequired for a person to renounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What does an American citizen have to do at the Embassy to\r\nrenounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, the law requires, in general, that an American\r\ncitizen, to renounce his citizenship, must appear before--I am not\r\nsure whether the law confines it to a consular officer--but at any\r\nrate must appear, in the case of the Foreign Service, appear before\r\na consular officer, and swear to an affidavit in the proper form,\r\nsomething of this order. In practical terms, it means that the consul\r\ndraws up a statement, the content of which--the exact wording of which\r\nis contained in our regulations, and has the person swear to it in his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, did Mr. Oswald ask for such an affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't think he asked for such an affidavit in those\r\nterms. I am not sure that he understood that completely, what the\r\nprocedure was. But he did ask to renounce his citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, did you provide him with the affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Why didn't you provide him with the affidavit at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, as the consul and, of course, the responsible person\r\nat the time, it didn't seem to me the sensible thing to do--in the\r\nsense that--I can't, I suppose, speak for all consuls, but it is sort\r\nof axiomatic, I think, in the consular service that when a man, a\r\ncitizen comes in and asks to renounce his citizenship, you don't whip\r\nout a piece of paper and have him sign it. This is a very serious step,\r\nof course, an irrevocable step, really, and if nothing else you attempt\r\nto provide enough time for--to make sure that the person knows what\r\nhe is doing. You explain, for one thing, what the meaning of the act\r\nis; and, secondly, again speaking for myself--I cannot speak for the\r\nForeign Service in this--provide a little breather, if possible make\r\nthe man leave your office and come back to it at a later time, just\r\nto make sure--for what value there is in making sure--that the man's\r\naction is not something completely off the top of his head.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, would it be helpful for the record\r\nto have put in the record at this point whatever the law is in this\r\nregard, and whatever the Department regulations are on this point?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That may be done; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to say, sir, at 2 o'clock the Legal Adviser\r\nto the State Department is coming in, and he is going to put it in at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask a question at this point?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. If you want it in now, we can indicate the sections which\r\nare applicable.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think there ought to be some citation at this\r\npoint, because the witness is talking specifically about the process of\r\nthe law and the regulations.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have the law there, Mr. Snyder--is that the law?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I brought nothing with me, myself.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I saw a book there that you were looking at, and I\r\nthought that would suffice.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Shall I read the section of law, sir?\r\n\r\nThis is the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 349(a)(6).\r\n\r\nSection 349(a) states, \"From and after the effective date of this Act,\r\na person who is a national of the United States, whether by birth or\r\nnaturalization, shall lose his nationality by\"--then section 6 under\r\nthat, subsection, states, \"making a formal renunciation of nationality\r\nbefore a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a\r\nforeign state in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, the Secretary of State has promulgated regulations\r\nwhich are found in 22 Code of Federal Regulations, sections 50.1 and\r\n50.2 and they are also reproduced in 8 Foreign Affairs Manual, section\r\n225.6.\r\n\r\nBasically, as I understand it, those regulations provide the form in\r\nwhich the citizen is to make the renunciation, and it is to be done in\r\nfour copies, and then one copy is to be given to the person who makes\r\nthe renunciation. Is that your understanding?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is my understanding; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are those forms available? Are they printed up, or\r\ndo you have to draft them? What is the circumstance?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. They are not printed forms, to my knowledge, Mr. Ford--at\r\nleast I have never seen a printed form. The only time that I have used\r\nthem in my Foreign Service experience I have had them typed up on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may continue, Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We ought to have in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, a copy\r\nof that form--either here or later.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. As I understood, someone from the State Department is\r\ncoming here to testify on the procedures, and the witness did not bring\r\nanything with him, he says.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, when you were talking to Mr. Oswald on October\r\n31, 1959, did he say anything with respect to applying for Soviet\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; this was contained in his written statement, for one\r\nthing, and I believe that he also stated this to me orally.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did he say anything with respect to having any information\r\nsince he had been in the Marine Corps that he would be willing to make\r\navailable to the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; he did. He stated again, in effect, that he would make\r\navailable to the Soviet authorities or to the Soviet Union what he had\r\nlearned concerning his speciality--he was an electronics specialist of\r\nsome sort, a radar technician--at any rate, he would make available to\r\nthe Soviet Union such knowledge as he had acquired while in the Marine\r\nCorps concerning his specialty.\r\n\r\nHe volunteered this statement. It was rather peculiar.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say that the interview lasted about a half an hour. I\r\ntake it he then left. Did he say he was going to return?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't believe he did. He gave no particular\r\nindication of when he would return, if he would return, or this sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall just what he said when he left your office?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you a document----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question there? Did he take his passport or\r\ndid he leave it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I kept it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You kept the passport?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you a document which has been marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 908, and it is a Foreign Service dispatch dated November\r\n2, 1959. This is from Embassy, Moscow, to the Department of State,\r\nWashington. It is signed by Edward L. Freers, but on the first page\r\nthere is an indication it was actually drafted by you. Do you recall\r\ndrafting the original of that document?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 908 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That statement was drafted within a day or two after you\r\nhad the interview with Mr. Oswald. I take it it reflects what happened\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was there any cabled report of this incident?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I cabled a report on the 31st, Mr. Dulles. Commission\r\nExhibit No. 908 is a somewhat fuller report, 2 days later.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. To answer Mr. Dulles' question, I show you a document\r\nwhich has been marked Commission Exhibit No. 910, which purports to be\r\na copy of a cable from Moscow to the Secretary of State, and ask you\r\nwhether that is the cable which was sent off on October 31, 1959.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 910 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I also had marked, and I would like to show you,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 909, which is a copy of a telegram from American\r\nEmbassy, Tokyo, to Secretary of State, dated November 27, 1963. This\r\ntelegram purports to be an interview which the Ambassador in Tokyo had\r\nwith you immediately after the assassination in which you attempted to\r\nrecall what happened on October 31, 1959, when Mr. Oswald appeared at\r\nthe Embassy.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 909 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I ask you if you can identify that telegram?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Might I just inject something? I notice in my reports, on\r\nmy first interview with Oswald, that I mention the Petrulli case. You\r\nmight at this time or later on wish to refer to the Petrulli case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Chairman, this cable is very short and quite\r\nsignificant. I wonder if it could not be read into the record at this\r\npoint, just for the continuity of the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. There is a slight problem of classification on these, Mr.\r\nDulles. I don't know how public the records are.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Maybe you could paraphrase it, then. You mean it is a\r\nquestion of codes?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It is a question of code security; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If this is in the record, it will be published.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you be kind enough to read Commission Exhibit No.\r\n910 into the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. In paraphrase?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Paraphrase, yes; in your own way.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Of course keeping the intent of what was said\r\nprecisely as it was sent.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nA person appeared at the Embassy today, October 31, identified himself\r\nas Lee Harvey Oswald, and stated that he had come to renounce his\r\nAmerican citizenship. He was the bearer of U.S. passport No. 1733242,\r\ndate of issuance September 10, 1959, which showed him to be unmarried\r\nand gave his age as 20, or which showed him to be 20--it gives his date\r\nof birth. Mr. Oswald stated that he had applied for Soviet citizenship\r\nin Moscow. He stated that he had entered the Soviet Union from\r\nHelsinki, Finland, on October 15. He said that he had contemplated this\r\naction for the previous 2 years. The main reason given was that \"I am a\r\nMarxist.\" He has a mother living at 4936 Collinwood Street, Fort Worth,\r\nTex., which was also his last address.\r\n\r\nHis attitude was arrogant and aggressive. He stated that he had\r\nrecently been discharged from the Marine Corps. He also volunteered\r\nthe information that he had offered to the Soviet authorities any\r\ninformation which he had acquired as an enlisted radar operator in the\r\nMarines.\r\n\r\nIn view of the Petrulli case, the Embassy proposes to delay completing\r\nthe renunciation procedure until the action of the Soviet authorities\r\non his request for Soviet citizenship is known or the Department\r\nadvises.\r\n\r\nA dispatch follows.\r\n\r\nThe press has been informed.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would the Commissioners like to see the document itself?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, could you tell the Commission what the\r\nPetrulli case was?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes. The Petrulli case I remember quite well.\r\n\r\nMr. Petrulli was an American citizen who came into the Embassy some\r\nweeks before, I believe, asking to renounce his American citizenship.\r\nMr. Petrulli hung around Moscow for quite some time, again a number of\r\nweeks, and perhaps as long as 3 weeks or a month. He had entered the\r\nSoviet Union as a tourist, I believe.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what intent he had when he arrived.\r\n\r\nBut, at any rate, he did apply for Soviet citizenship while in Moscow,\r\nand he did come into the Embassy, and was interviewed by me to renounce\r\nhis American citizenship. I did not, in accordance with the thinking\r\nwhich I outlined to you earlier--I did not accept his renunciation\r\nthe first time he came in, but did accept it when he subsequently\r\nappeared, and insisted that is what he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nThe case had a--I might skip over the minor details, but it had a\r\nrather rapid denouncement, when the Soviet authorities, after having\r\nlooked him over for a number of weeks, decided they did not want him\r\nas a citizen or resident of the Soviet Union. And when we subsequently\r\nlearned, that is I learned, from my reporting to the Department, and\r\ncorrespondence with them, that Mr. Petrulli had been discharged from\r\nthe Armed Forces some time earlier on, I believe, a 100-percent mental\r\ndisability--the Soviet, I think it was the head of the consular section\r\nof the Soviet Foreign Ministry, called me into the Foreign Ministry one\r\nday and said words to the effect that an American citizen Mr. Petrulli,\r\nhas overstayed his visa in the Soviet Union, he is living here\r\nillegally, and \"We request that you take steps to see that he leaves\r\nthe country immediately.\"\r\n\r\nI told the Soviet official that to the best of my knowledge Mr.\r\nPetrulli was not then an American citizen, he having executed a\r\nrenunciation of citizenship before me.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet official said in effect, \"As far as we are concerned, he\r\ncame here on an American passport, and we ask that you get him out of\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nWell, again to end what was a long, involved and terribly\r\ntime-consuming story at the time, it was determined by the Department\r\nthat Mr. Petrulli's renunciation was null and void because he was not\r\ncompetent, and therefore he was an American citizen, and we shipped him\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe Petrulli case, as I say, was very much in my mind when Mr. Oswald\r\nshowed up.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you sent the telegram, which is Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 910, to the State Department, I take it that the first word that\r\nyou received from the State Department is a telegram which I have\r\nmarked as Commission Exhibit No. 916.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 916 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, by paraphrasing, could you read the second paragraph\r\nof that telegram into the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. \"For your information, in the event that Mr. Oswald insists\r\non completing a renunciation of his United States citizenship, the\r\nEmbassy is precluded by the provisions of section 1999 of the Revised\r\nStatutes from withholding the right to do so without regard to the\r\nstatus of his application for citizenship which is pending before the\r\nSoviet government and without regard to the Petrulli case.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. At the same time that you were notifying the State\r\nDepartment that Oswald had appeared, someone in the Embassy also sent\r\na telegram to the Navy Department, didn't he, advising that Oswald, a\r\nformer Marine, had appeared at the Embassy and stated that he was a\r\nradar operator in the Marine Corps, and that he had offered to furnish\r\nthe Soviets the information he possessed on radar.\r\n\r\nI have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 917 this telegram and ask you\r\nwhether that is the telegram that went forth to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 917 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't recall that I saw this telegram at the time. But I\r\nwould say from the content of it, and the form, that it is clearly a\r\ntelegram sent by the naval attaché of the Embassy to his home office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We also have had marked as Commission Exhibit No. 918 the\r\ntelegram which the Navy sent in reply to Commission Exhibit No. 917.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 918 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Have you seen that before and can you identify that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I do not recall having seen this telegram before; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, sir; the next contact that you had with Oswald was by\r\na letter dated November 3, 1959, which has been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 912, is that correct?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 912 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes--to the best of my knowledge, this was the next thing\r\nthat I heard of Oswald--the next thing I heard from Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How did the original of Commission Exhibit No. 912 come\r\ninto your possession?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I believe it came through the mail.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And after you received Commission Exhibit No. 912, what\r\ndid you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I wrote Mr. Oswald a reply, I believe, the same day.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Exhibit No. 912 was a request to revoke his application\r\nto renounce citizenship, was it not?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No, Mr. Chief Justice; Commission Exhibit No. 912 is a\r\nletter from Mr. Oswald complaining that the Embassy had not permitted\r\nhim to renounce.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I misread it. Yes; that is right. Excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say you wrote Mr. Oswald a letter the same day?\r\n\r\nWe have had marked as Commission Exhibit No. 919 a letter from Richard\r\nE. Snyder, to Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 6, 1959.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 919 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show it to you and ask you is this a copy of the letter\r\nwhich you wrote to Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we have some indication of what that letter is, for\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Referring back to Exhibit No. 912, where I was acting\r\napparently under some misapprehension I read the first three lines and\r\nit said \"Nov. 3, 1959. I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my\r\npresent United States citizenship be revoked.\" Well, that is consistent\r\nwith what was said.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think that is a pretty categorical statement.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He subsequently, in Exhibit No. 912, makes a\r\nprotest about the fact that he was not accorded that right previously.\r\nBut I don't see how we could come to any other conclusion but the first\r\nthree lines are a specific request for the right to revoke his American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; but I had misread that first sentence, and I had\r\nasked if it wasn't a revocation of his original request. I was in error\r\nwhen I said that. You are correct, absolutely, on your interpretation\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. As a result of receiving Commission Exhibit No. 912, you\r\nwrote Mr. Oswald a letter which has been--a copy of which has been\r\nmarked and identified as Commission Exhibit No. 919, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Earlier in your testimony, when asked about what a citizen\r\nhas to do to renounce his citizenship, you referred to section 349(a)\r\n(6).\r\n\r\nI would like to call your attention to the fact there is also another\r\nprovision--section 349(a) (2)--which provides that an American citizen\r\nshall lose his nationality by \"taking an oath or making an affirmation\r\nor other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a\r\npolitical subdivision thereof.\"\r\n\r\nDid you consider whether the Oswald letter, marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 912, was such an affirmation or other formal declaration?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. There is a considerable body of law, I believe,\r\ninterpreting this provision of law as to what constitutes an\r\naffirmation or other formal declaration. I believe that I was quite\r\naware at the time that a mere statement did not constitute a formal\r\ndeclaration within the meaning of the law.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask one question about Exhibit No. 912?\r\n\r\nIn the second paragraph of this letter, Exhibit No. 912, Oswald says,\r\n\"I appered [sic] in person at the consulate office of the United States\r\nEmbassy, Moscow, on Oct. 31st, for the purpose of signing the formal\r\npapers to this effect. This legal right I was refused at that time.\"\r\n\r\nDo you know how he learned about his legal rights? Did you tell him his\r\nlegal rights in your conversation with him? Or where did he get the\r\ninformation about his legal rights, if you know about that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Dulles, I did\r\ndiscuss with Oswald both the significance of his act and the legal\r\nbasis of it, and so forth. And I believe that in the letter which I\r\nwrote to him----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which was subsequent to Exhibit No. 912, was it not, in\r\nanswer to 912?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. In answer to Exhibit No. 912--in the letter which I wrote,\r\nreplying to this, I purposely used the word, I think, \"again\", or words\r\nto that effect, and I put that word in there at the time, indicating\r\nthat he had been told this before, and that I was repeating it to him.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You are talking about Commission Exhibit No. 919, the\r\nthird paragraph, is that correct, where you use the word \"again\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; that is correct.\r\n\r\nIn other words, at the time Oswald was there, the reason which I gave\r\nhim for not taking his renunciation at the time was not that he was\r\nnot legally entitled to have it, but that the office was closed at the\r\ntime. In matter of fact, I don't think I had a secretary there to type\r\nout the form and so forth. But this is really quite beside the point.\r\n\r\nBut the reason which I gave him was not that I had any legal right to\r\nrefuse him--that is, it wasn't based on a provision of law, as it was\r\nbased on simply the fact that the Embassy was closed at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You will recall in Commission Exhibit No. 913, which was\r\nthe first letter that Oswald gave you, that the last paragraph states,\r\n\"I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics,\" and once again I take it that you didn't think that that\r\nwas the type of oath or affirmation which is set forth in section\r\n349(a) (2)?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Snyder, in reference to the same document, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 913, do you think that Mr. Oswald, when he appeared before\r\nyou and gave this to you, believed in his mind that this was sufficient\r\nto renounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How could he tell what was in his mind?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I really don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Do you believe that if you had given Mr. Oswald the\r\nopportunity to carry through with the procedures, that he would have\r\nrenounced his citizenship at that first appearance?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I have every reason to believe he would have.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I also would like to show you a copy of a passport\r\nissued by the United States, which has been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 946, and ask you whether that is the passport that Mr.\r\nOswald gave to you when he came into the Embassy on October 31, 1959.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask a preliminary question about Exhibit No. 913?\r\n\r\nThis is undated. Do we know the date of the receipt of this by the\r\nEmbassy?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, Mr. Dulles; the testimony is that when Mr. Oswald\r\ncame into the Embassy, sir, he handed this document to Mr. Snyder.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the first time he came in, he handed this document\r\nto you?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly his passport; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you received Commission Exhibit No. 919, which is\r\nthe second letter from Oswald, the letter dated November 3, 1959, you\r\nthen prepared and sent to the Secretary of State in Washington an\r\nairgram which the Commission has had marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n920.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 920 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you the document and ask you whether you prepared\r\nthe original thereof and sent it to the State Department?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question here?\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald first came in, and either placed his passport on the desk\r\nor the table, or you asked for it, did you note that he had overstayed\r\nhis visa by 5 days?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I can't recall that I did or did not, Mr. Ford.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that something that you would normally examine\r\nand determine under circumstances like this?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, I might if there were some reason to look at it--if it\r\nwere particularly relevant to something I was thinking at the time or\r\nasking about at the time.\r\n\r\nIn terms of Soviet practice, it is not really too relevant. That is,\r\nif the Soviet authorities find it to their interest to keep a person\r\naround, then there is no problem. And if they do not, one does not\r\noverstay one's visa in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But if it is, for some Soviet reason, a good\r\nreason to keep somebody around beyond the time of their visa, wouldn't\r\nthat be of some interest to us--I mean to the United States officials?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; but, of course, that assumption was already\r\nstrongly made in the Oswald case by other circumstances in this case.\r\nThere was no question in my mind that Mr. Oswald was there in Moscow\r\nfor the purposes for which he stated he was in Moscow, and that this\r\nwas known to the Soviet authorities, for he said he had applied for\r\nSoviet citizenship.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is it the usual thing for them to let an\r\nindividual stay beyond their visa termination date?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, I would say it is not usual. Again, one can never\r\ncite a list of specific instances in these things, but I think that\r\nwhen you are working as a consul in Moscow for a couple of years, you\r\nhave a considerable feel for these things, and that I would say it is\r\nnot usual--people simply do not overstay their visas in the Soviet\r\nUnion without the knowledge, by and large, of the Soviet authorities.\r\n\r\nAnd this is because of the nature of the passport registration system\r\nat your hotel, and all of this sort of thing. It simply is not normally\r\ndone by oversight or by lapse either on the part of the individual or\r\non the part of the Soviet State.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When he presented the passport, or when you were\r\ngiven the passport by him, did you examine it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I undoubtedly examined it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where in the passport would this fact be noted\r\nthat he had overstayed his visa by 5 days?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It may either be on the original visa or on the police\r\nstamp placed in his passport at the time. This is to the best of my\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Congressman Ford, as I understand it, one of the stamps in\r\nthe passport, which would be in Russian, indicates the visa that he got\r\nin Helsinki, and also indicates the length of time he was permitted to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So it is clearly a Soviet document in the passport?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I could probably find these for you, if you would like.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When Oswald came in, did you notice anything\r\npeculiar about his physical appearance--any bruises, any injuries of\r\nany kind?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, no; as I said--you may not have been here, Mr. Ford, at\r\nthe time I made my original comments on his appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was very neatly dressed, very well composed, and to all outward\r\nappearances a respectable-looking young man.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I was there then, and I was interested because\r\nI think we have testimony to the effect, or we have documentation to\r\nthe effect, that he had tried to commit suicide prior to his coming to\r\nthe American Embassy for the purpose of renouncing his citizenship. In\r\nother words, he had cut his wrist and had been in a Soviet hospital or\r\nmedical facility. And I was wondering whether you had noticed that.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You did not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, on November 2 you sent forward Commission\r\nExhibit No. 908, which is the Foreign Service dispatch. You had also\r\nsent forth 2 days earlier a telegram advising them about Oswald.\r\n\r\nAnd on November 12 you had sent forth Commission Exhibit No. 920. Now,\r\naccording to the files that we have, except for Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 916, which is the telegram asking where the dispatch was, we have\r\nno other communication during this period from the Department to the\r\nEmbassy giving you advice on what to do in the Oswald case.\r\n\r\nWas there any messages that went back to the Embassy, other than\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 916, during that period?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I can't really say, Mr. Coleman, that I have personal\r\nrecollection. But I have no reason to believe that there was anything\r\nelse came in, other than what is now in our files.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, would you expect to get some answers to those\r\ndispatches that you were sending forward to Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not really--not really. The thrust of information in\r\nsomething like this is from the field to the Department. The Department\r\nreally answered the only thing which I asked them. That is, I told\r\nthe Department what I intended to do concerning his request for\r\nrenunciation, and the Department responded to that. And this was really\r\nall I would have expected from them at the time.\r\n\r\nI would have expected--if the Department had had any information\r\nconcerning Oswald in its files--I would have expected them to let me\r\nknow if they had indication, for instance, that Oswald was mentally\r\nunbalanced or emotionally unstable or anything else of this sort,\r\nanything which might look like a repeat of the Petrulli pattern, I\r\nwould have expected them to let me know this, so I would know how to\r\nhandle the case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, 3 days before Mr. Oswald came into the Embassy, did\r\nyou have occasion to write a letter to Mr. Boster in Washington, asking\r\nhim how you should handle these matters of attempted renunciation of\r\nAmerican citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is this the first time he came into the Embassy?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This is 3 days before he came.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The first time?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I recall writing. I think probably the letter you have in\r\nmind--\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 914 which is a letter\r\ndated October 28, 1959, from Mr. Snyder to Mr. Boster, and ask you\r\nwhether that is a letter you sent.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 914 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that a copy of the letter that you sent to Mr. Boster?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Doesn't that letter, at the bottom, indicate that you were\r\nattempting to get advice on how to handle an attempted renunciation of\r\nAmerican citizenship? At the bottom of the first page.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; this is a letter which I wrote to Gene Boster. This\r\nletter, I might add, did not refer to any particular case, but was a\r\nletter in which I had put down ideas which had been circulating in my\r\nmind for some time, based on my initial handling of cases in Moscow.\r\nAnd it was by way of putting down, as I say, some general ideas on the\r\nsubject, and asking Gene what the Department felt about this general\r\narea of notions. It wasn't directed at any particular case.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you feel that the regulations then, as well as\r\nnow, and the law as well, are archaic in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, no; it is simply that--not the law, and certainly not\r\nthe regulations--and certainly not the law, can ever take the place of\r\nthe judgment of the officer on the spot.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this motivated by the Petrulli case?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't think it was. The Petrulli case was a clear-cut\r\ncase, there was no problem with the Petrulli case, legal or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt was motivated, as best I can recall, by my experience with a few\r\nother cases. Well, let's say--let's go back a little bit further, in\r\na more general vein. The kind of people, the kind of Americans, and I\r\nsuppose not only Americans but Frenchmen, Englishmen, and otherwise,\r\nwho occasionally drift into the Soviet Union and state that they want\r\nto roll up their sleeves and go to work for socialism for the rest of\r\ntheir lives, or something of this sort, are usually quite a peculiar\r\nkind of person.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they are rarely Marxists in any meaningful sense\r\nof the term. That is, they don't really know what it is all about.\r\nThey probably don't know two words about Marxist theories, or Marxism,\r\nLeninism, Stalinism, or anything else. Even less do they know anything\r\nabout the country that they have chosen to spend their lives in,\r\ntheoretically.\r\n\r\nAlmost universally they have never been to the country before. They\r\nspeak no Russian. And they are rebounding from something--in some\r\ncases, such as the Petrulli case, the man is simply incompetent. In\r\nother cases, as in the Webster case, he appears to have been fleeing\r\nfrom his wife and the general responsibilities of his prior position,\r\nand finding that he could not escape from them in the Soviet Union\r\neither.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Oswald, a man who, for one reason or another, seemed\r\nto have been uncomfortable in his own society, unable to accommodate\r\nhimself to it, and hoping he will make out better some place else.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, almost universally, the pattern is of a person who is not\r\nacting out of any ideological grounds. He simply doesn't--and I think\r\nthis is essentially true probably of Oswald--this was my feeling in\r\nspeaking with him--that Oswald really knew nothing about Marxism and\r\nLeninism, that he professed to be modeling his life after.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Isn't it possible, though, from this discussion--maybe this\r\nshould be asked to your legal adviser--that our procedure under law\r\nabout renunciation may be in conflict with general international law,\r\nbecause if he comes into the country with an American passport, as an\r\nAmerican citizen, I gather under ordinary international law we have to\r\ntake him back. We are responsible for him. And no renunciation he makes\r\nchanges that, as the Petrulli case shows.\r\n\r\nNow, in the Petrulli case you had a situation where he was incompetent,\r\nand you could throw the thing out on the ground he didn't know what he\r\nwas doing. But in these other cases, maybe you can't.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, in the specific instance and circumstances of the\r\nSoviet Union, you obviously have a major problem, there is a major\r\nstate problem.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That might arise in other cases. Isn't that true in any\r\ncase--If an American citizen arrives with an American passport, the\r\ncountry where he arrives doesn't have to keep him, does it? Isn't it\r\nour responsibility to take him back?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, this is a point----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is a question of law.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is a question of law which I really cannot answer.\r\n\r\nAnd where we have an extradition treaty, I think there is no great\r\nproblem, perhaps, or at least the problem is somewhat different from\r\nwhere we do not have an extradition treaty, as in the case of the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nAnd I just don't know whether we are in the last analysis required to\r\ntake back a person who is no longer one of our citizens, and under\r\ncircumstances where we do not have an extradition treaty with the\r\nnation, where that person now resides.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do we have an extradition treaty with the Soviet\r\nUnion?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nWell, we did not at that time, and I don't think we have subsequently.\r\nBut we did not at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do the legal advisers to the Department know\r\nwhether we have an extradition treaty now?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We do not have an extradition treaty with the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe only bilateral treaty we have with the Soviet Union, the Senate has\r\nnot yet given advice and consent--but the only bilateral agreement is\r\nthe consular agreement.\r\n\r\nBut so long as I am on the record here, I don't see how the extradition\r\ntreaty has any bearing at all on the requirement of taking back a\r\nformer American citizen who may get into trouble in the other country.\r\nThat would be a matter governed by general principles of international\r\nlaw, and also one's own humanitarian outlook on the particular\r\ncircumstance, rather than--or there could be treaty provisions perhaps,\r\ncommerce and navigation, that might bear on it. But in the usual case,\r\nI think not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question here? It might save time.\r\n\r\nIs there any statutory--any statute bearing on this question of\r\nrenunciation?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator Cooper, we just went through that, and it has\r\nbeen put in evidence here, and the statute has been read and it is very\r\nsimple. All he has to do is go there and renounce before a consul or\r\nState officer to satisfy the regulations and requirements of the State\r\nDepartment, and he is out.\r\n\r\nIsn't that correct, generally speaking?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is there any other statute bearing upon the effect of\r\nthat renunciation with respect to any application or petition he might\r\nmake later to renew his citizenship in the United States? Is there any?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would assume, sir, if he has made a valid renunciation,\r\nhe is then just like any other non-American that wants to come into the\r\nUnited States. He has to go through one of the immigration quotas.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. He must get an immigration visa.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I remember during the war and after the war we had\r\nproblems with persons who had become naturalized citizens, and were\r\nreturned to their countries, and in effect renounced their citizenship\r\nin various ways. As I remember, under certain circumstances they could\r\nrenew their citizenship with the United States. But, as I understand\r\nit, there is no provision of law respecting a citizen of the United\r\nStates who actually renounces his citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The issues in all those cases, I believe, were whether the\r\npurported expatriating act was actually an expatriating act. Whether\r\nthey had voted voluntarily or served in a foreign army voluntarily, or\r\nsomething like that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All this matter, the legal side of it, will be put into\r\nthe record?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. At 2 o'clock, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Snyder, after you wrote that letter to Mr. Boster, which\r\nis Commission Exhibit No. 914, you received a reply to your letter\r\nwhich was signed by Nathaniel Davis, acting officer in charge, Soviet\r\naffairs, dated December 10, 1959, which has been marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 915.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 915 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, also on December 1, 1959, you sent an airgram to the\r\nState Department indicating that you had been informed that Oswald had\r\nleft the hotel at which he had been staying in Moscow, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you a document which has been identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 921, and ask you whether that is a copy of the\r\nairgram you sent forward to the Department.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 921 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In Exhibit No. 921, you stated that you felt that he had\r\nnot carried through with his original intent to renounce American\r\ncitizenship in order to leave a crack open. Now, what information did\r\nyou have which led you to put that in the airgram?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am not sure whether this was my statement or----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, would you look at that, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; this was the statement of the correspondent. The\r\ncorrespondent states that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Oh, you were informing the Department that the\r\ncorrespondent told you that she felt that Oswald may have been leaving\r\na crack open?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is right. This crack part here is part of the sentence\r\n\"correspondent states.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Who was the correspondent?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This was Priscilla Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And I take it you were the one that prepared Commission\r\nExhibit No. 921?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You also state that no known Soviet publicity on case. I\r\ntake it you meant by that there had been no mentioning in the Soviet\r\npress about Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Are you saying from the time he came into your Embassy\r\noffice until the time you wrote that airgram, that there was nothing in\r\nthe Soviet press about Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that usual in these cases, where Americans attempt to\r\nrenounce their citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think if there is a usual pattern--and, again, this is\r\ndifficult to use words like \"usual\" because there are never two cases\r\nalike in this sort of thing--but if there is a usual pattern, it is\r\nthat there is some exploitation of the defector in Soviet public\r\nmedia, usually after the details of his defection have been settled,\r\nparticularly the detail as to whether the Soviet Union desires to have\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nUp to that point, publicity in the Soviet press probably is not to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you sent the airgram dated December 1, 1959, to the\r\nDepartment of State, which is Commission Exhibit No. 921, you didn't\r\nhave any more contact with Oswald until some time in February 1961, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In the meantime, however, there was correspondence between\r\nthe Embassy in Moscow and the State Department, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did----\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, let me see.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I will mark----\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I guess there was. There was one or more welfare and\r\nwhereabouts inquiries concerning him from his mother, which I think was\r\nthe bulk, if not all, of the correspondence which we were engaged in\r\nbetween those two periods.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, one such memorandum which went from the State\r\nDepartment to Moscow was a memorandum dated March 21, 1960, which\r\nhas been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 922, which indicates that\r\nRepresentative Wright of Texas had made inquiry with respect to the\r\nwhereabouts of Oswald.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 922 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And attached to the operations memorandum which was marked\r\nas Commission Exhibit No. 922 is the letter sent to Congressman Wright,\r\nwhich has been marked as Exhibit 923.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 923 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And also a letter sent to Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, which\r\nhas been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 924.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 924 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In reply to Commission Exhibit No. 922, you prepared and\r\nsent to the Department of State an operations memorandum under date of\r\nMarch 28, 1960, which we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 927.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 927 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In Commission Exhibit No. 927, you make the statement that\r\nthe Embassy has no evidence that Oswald has expatriated himself other\r\nthan his announced intention to do so \"and the Embassy is, therefore,\r\ntechnically in a position to institute an inquiry concerning his\r\nwhereabouts through a note to the Foreign Office.\"\r\n\r\nDo you recall that statement in the operations memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was it your thought, then, that based upon all the\r\ndocuments you had and what transpired on October 31, 1959, and the\r\nsubsequent letter that Oswald sent, that in your judgment he had not\r\nrenounced his American citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. The statement which I made in that letter--to be quite\r\naccurate, as to its content--was made not for the--that is, the\r\nstatement wasn't directing itself to the question has Oswald lost his\r\ncitizenship or not, but rather to the question would we have the right\r\nin Soviet eyes to ask about the whereabouts of this man. The Soviet\r\nauthorities took a very strict line that no foreign government had\r\nthe right to inquire about any resident of the Soviet Union unless he\r\nwas their citizen. So that my statement was merely--was meant there\r\nto support my conclusion that the Embassy, as far as we could see,\r\nwould have the right in Soviet eyes to ask about the whereabouts of\r\nOswald--because we had no reason to believe he was not our citizen,\r\nand, therefore, we had a perfect right to ask about where he might be.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, in your own mind, at that point,\r\nhe had not renounced his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. There is no question he had not renounced his citizenship;\r\nyes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You considered that he was still an American citizen as of\r\nMarch 28----\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is, he hadn't taken the procedures required under the\r\nlaw to renounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. He had not renounced his citizenship, and there was no\r\nevidence that he had acquired Soviet citizenship. These were the two\r\nthings under which I think he could possibly have lost his citizenship\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nSo, for lack of evidence to the contrary, he was an American citizen.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. On April 5, 1960--you received an operations memorandum\r\nfrom the Department of State, dated March 28, 1960, which we have had\r\nmarked as Commission Exhibit No. 929. Do you recall receiving that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 929 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The second paragraph of that memorandum indicates that a\r\nlookout card or file has been opened or prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What does that mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Never having worked in this end of the Department of\r\nState, I can say only what it would mean in general terms--when one\r\nsays a lookout card has been prepared, it means that an entry has been\r\nmade in the file in such fashion that should someone look in the file\r\nfor--under this name or this category, that there would be--that their\r\nattention would be flagged by this entry, and their attention would\r\nbe called to the fact that there is something that they ought to look\r\ninto. In other words, it is kind of a red flag placed--perhaps red flag\r\nis not the word to use here--but it is a flag placed in the file to\r\nattract the attention of anyone looking in the file under that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then on May 10, 1960, and again on June 22, 1960, you\r\nreceived two operations memorandums from the State Department making\r\ninquiries with respect to Mr. Oswald. Can you identify those?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You remember receiving those?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The operations memorandum dated May 10, 1960, was given\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 928, and the operations memorandum dated June\r\n22, 1960, has been given Commission Exhibit No. 925.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 925 and\r\n928, respectively, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In response to those two operations memorandums, you,\r\nthen, on July 6, 1960, sent forth an operations memorandum which has\r\nbeen given Commission Exhibit No. 926, which states that until you get\r\nother instructions, you are not going to make any further inquiry or\r\ndo anything further in connection with Oswald, is that correct?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 926 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then, sir, on February 1, 1961, you received a Department\r\nof State instruction which was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 930,\r\nwhich requested the Embassy to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs--to\r\ninform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Oswald's mother was\r\nworried about his personal safety, and was anxious to hear from him.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 930 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you ever make such an inquiry of the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, I think I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know just when that Department instruction reached\r\nthe Embassy in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. The date should be stamped on the document.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, on the copy we have, sir, there is no date. I take\r\nit you have no independent recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; it should have been within a week, though.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it, though, you would say that Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 930 went by diplomatic pouch.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This didn't go by cable?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, that is not a telegraphic form.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. On February 13, 1961, you received a letter from Mr.\r\nOswald, did you not?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you a copy of a letter which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 931, and I ask you whether that is a copy of a\r\nletter you received from Mr. Oswald.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 931 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, it would be helpful, I think, if we\r\nwould pass these around, or if copies would be available to us at the\r\ntime. Otherwise--at least I am not able to know what is transpiring\r\nbetween the counsel and the witness.\r\n\r\nAre there extra copies of these we could have to examine as the exhibit\r\nis submitted to the witness?\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. We could have them made up, Mr. Ford. I don't think there\r\nare any extra ones right now.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, suppose before you pass it to the witness you pass\r\nit to me, and I will pass it to Congressman Ford, and then over to\r\nCommissioner Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This letter is presumably the reason why no action was\r\ntaken on the previous operations memorandum. It was overtaken,\r\npresumably, by Oswald's letter.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you indicate for the record what Oswald said in his\r\nletter which has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 931?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Perhaps I might just read the letter into the record.\r\n\r\nThe letter is dated February, no date.\r\n\r\n\"Dear sirs\"----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What year?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. 1961.\r\n\r\n\"Since I have not received a reply to my letter of December 1960, I am\r\nwriting again asking that you consider my request for the return of my\r\nAmerican passport.\r\n\r\n\"I desire to return to the United States, that is if we could come to\r\nsome agreement concernig [sic] the dropping of any legal proceedings\r\nagainst me. If so, then I would be free to ask the Russian authorities\r\nto allow me to leave. If I could show them my American passport, I am\r\nof the opinion they would give me an exit visa.\r\n\r\n\"They have at no time insisted that I take Russian citizenship. I am\r\nliving here with non-permanent type papers for a foreigner.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave Minsk without permission, therefore I am writing rather\r\nthan calling in person.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that in recalling the responsibility I have to America that you\r\nremember your's in doing everything you can to help me since I am an\r\nAmerican citizen.\r\n\r\n\"Sincerely Lee Harvey Oswald.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is addressed to the American Embassy in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It is simply \"Dear sirs:\" As near as I can recall, it came\r\nby mail, through the Soviet mail, addressed to the Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Had you received a letter from Mr. Oswald at a date of\r\nDecember 1960, the way he mentioned in the first paragraph of his\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; we did not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This is the first letter you received?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is the first communication since he left Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would next like to mark as Commission Exhibit No. 933\r\nthe reply which you made to Mr. Oswald, which is dated February 28,\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 933 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When you say since he left Moscow, that was in----\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. November 1959, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. November 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is what we presume was the date.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Dulles, we have other evidence that he didn't leave\r\nuntil January 7, 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The last the Embassy heard from him was in November 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You have been shown Commission Exhibit No. 933. Is that a\r\ncopy of a letter which you sent to Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. At the same time did you inform the State Department that\r\nyou had received a letter from Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I presume that I did.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have had marked as Commission Exhibit No. 932 a Foreign\r\nService Despatch under date of February 28, 1961, from the Embassy in\r\nMoscow to the State Department in Washington. I would like to ask you\r\nwhether this is the despatch which you sent forth to the Department.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 932 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do the records show the date that the letter from\r\nOswald was written--yes; February 5--and received February 13. This\r\ncommunication is dated February 28. Is that a long or a short time in\r\ncommunicating with Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I would say it is a long time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there any explanation why it is a long time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. The only thing I could think of is simply that Moscow is\r\na very busy office, and Mr. Oswald's case was no longer the top of my\r\ndocket.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Had there been any communication with the State\r\nDepartment in Washington concerning the inquiries of the mother, other\r\nthan this?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't know, Mr. Ford. The only knowledge I had at the\r\ntime of inquiries is what I was informed of by the Department. I\r\npresume that they informed me of all inquiries--since they could hardly\r\nact upon them themselves.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the date of the last inquiry by the mother\r\nas to Oswald's----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I think the record will show that on January 26,\r\n1961, the mother came to the State Department and as a result of that\r\nvisit, that inquiry of February 1, 1961, went forward, making the\r\ninquiry. It has already been put in as an exhibit.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is the trouble not keeping copies available.\r\nIt is a little difficult to follow the sequence.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is Commission Exhibit No. 930.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This document, Commission Exhibit No. 930, shows\r\nwhat, as far as you are concerned, Mr. Snyder?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, it shows an interest by Oswald's mother in his\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As of what date, and where?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It says that Mrs. Oswald called at the Department of State\r\non January 26, 1961; she personally called at the Department to inquire\r\nabout her son.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And that was communicated to the Embassy in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When was it received in the Embassy in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, this doesn't show the date of receipt, but it was\r\nsent on February 1, and was received within a week of that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And according to the records, the letter written\r\nby Oswald on February 5, 1961, which was received--was received\r\nFebruary 13, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And this document, Commission Exhibit No. 933,\r\nshows a reply was given February 28, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think that is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Does that mean it took 8 days to go from Minsk to Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Isn't that an unusually long time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, not too much of that time is transit time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what I was getting at.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It also shows it took 15 days to get out of the\r\nAmerican Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. You must remember that in my eyes, as the officer on the\r\nspot, Mr. Oswald had no claim to prior action from the Embassy among\r\nother cases. And although the consular officer attempts to be as\r\nimpersonal as he can about these things, in matter of fact it is very\r\ndifficult to be entirely impersonal.\r\n\r\nMr. Oswald had no claim to any unusual attentions of mine, I must say.\r\n\r\nI think that the letter from Oswald from the Metropole Hotel to the\r\nEmbassy took something like 3 days or 4 days.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What does that mean to you? Does that mean that\r\nhis correspondence was intercepted?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. There was no question about that, Mr. Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Intercepted by Soviet authorities?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; this has been known for years.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Common practice?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; every embassy there knows the system, and operates\r\nwithin it. All mail from or to a foreign embassy in Moscow goes to a\r\nseparate section of the Moscow Post Office, called the international\r\nsection, and this is the screening office for all mail to and from any\r\nembassy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As far as you know, is that still the process\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am sure it is, sir. The essentials of the Soviet State\r\nhaven't changed.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a few questions?\r\n\r\nI have been examining these exhibits which have been introduced. The\r\nfirst one I have looked at is Exhibit No. 908, which refers to Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald's call at the Embassy and your interview with him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that from Moscow to Washington, the State Department?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes; it is your interview with Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In this he states that he applied for a Soviet tourist\r\nvisa in Helsinki on October 14. He applied for citizenship by letter\r\nto the Supreme Soviet on October 16, in Moscow. And your report to the\r\nState Department said that he appeared at the Embassy on October 31,\r\nand presented his request for renunciation in writing.\r\n\r\nI assume that you have had other cases of this kind, have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, particularly the Petrulli case, yes; a few weeks\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would it be normal in your judgment that this period\r\nof time, from the time he applied to the Soviet for citizenship, the\r\nSupreme Soviet, which was on October 16, as he said, it would not be\r\nacted upon in 2 weeks?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I would think it would be highly unusual if it were acted\r\nupon in 2 weeks; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did others talk to him in the Embassy beside you?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not to my knowledge; no, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you know whether or not newspaper people, American\r\nnewspaper people were talking to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I know that Priscilla Johnson talked to him. Whether others\r\ngot to him, I don't know. He wasn't terribly communicative.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did she tell you she talked to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But you do not know whether or not other members of the\r\nEmbassy staff talked to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I have no reason to believe that anyone else talked to him,\r\nother than myself, Senator Cooper. That is, at this time. I mean at a\r\nlater time, Mr. McVickar, I presume, talked to Oswald. He talked to his\r\nwife, I am quite sure. I presume that Oswald was with her. But up until\r\nthe time that I left Moscow, Oswald was my baby, and I don't think\r\nanyone else talked to him in the Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were there other cases, other than the Petrulli and the\r\nOswald case, where Americans attempted to or did renounce their\r\ncitizenship while you were in Moscow in this period?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. To whom were you directly responsible in the Embassy?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. My immediate superior was Mr. Freers, Edward Freers, who\r\nwas the Deputy Chief of Mission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was he informed about this case?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who was the American ambassador at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Ambassador Thompson.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he know about it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I presume he did. Ambassador Thompson knew everything that\r\nwent on in his shop. If through no other means, both the Ambassador and\r\nthe DCM, the Deputy Chief of Mission, read the correspondence coming in\r\nand out, and this is their basic line of information.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In your report, Commission Exhibit No. 908, you stated\r\nthat he knew the provisions of U.S. law on loss of citizenship, and\r\ndeclined to have them reviewed by the interviewing officer. Is that\r\ncorrect? He said he knew how he could renounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I attempted to explain to him at the time the\r\nseriousness of his move, the meaning of it, the irrevocability of it\r\nand the section of law applying. He was quite curt in his manner, and\r\napparently among other things, declined to have me read the law to him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Exhibit No. 920 refers to the letter received by the\r\nEmbassy from Lee Oswald, who was residing in the Metropole Hotel. It\r\ndoes show that it was dated November 3, and received, according to\r\nthis, on November 12, no, date sent November 7.\r\n\r\nThis could be a speculation. It appears to me, though, it is a very\r\nwell written letter. \"I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that\r\nmy present United States citizenship be revoked. I appered [sic] in\r\nperson, at the consulate office of the U.S. Embassy, Moscow, on Oct.\r\n31st for the purpose of signing the formal papers to this effect. This\r\nlegal right I was refused at that time. I wish to protest against this\r\naction and against the conduct of the official of the United States\r\nconsular service who acted on behalf of the United States Government.\r\nMy application requesting that I be considered for citizenship in the\r\nSoviet Union is now pending before the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.\r\nIn the event of acceptance, I will request my government to lodge a\r\nformal protest regarding this incident.\"\r\n\r\nSigned \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\"\r\n\r\nI would assume that the last sentence referred to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. From your examination and interview with Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, your talks with him, does that letter appear to be one which he\r\nhad the capacity to write in that language and form?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is a difficult thing to speculate on, Senator Cooper.\r\nI would say this----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. It is a very good letter.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. At first blush, I would not say that it was beyond his\r\ncapacity. He did strike me as an intelligent man. He was certainly\r\nvery articulate. Actually still a boy, I suppose, in a sense--he was\r\n20 at the time I saw him. He was a very articulate person, and quite\r\nintelligent. I don't think from what I saw of him that the letter is\r\nbeyond his capacity to have written.\r\n\r\nThere is also an element of it which is very much Oswaldish, and that\r\nis the last paragraph, the rather strident tones of it. One finds this\r\nin his other correspondence with the Embassy, and in the tone which\r\nhe took when he first spoke with me--extremely strident tone. It is\r\nalmost comical in a sense, this last paragraph, in its pomposity, its\r\nsonorousness. I am quite prepared to believe that the last part at\r\nleast is Oswald's.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. One other question.\r\n\r\nIn your report you noted that he had made statements about the United\r\nStates, derogatory statements.\r\n\r\nDid he ever direct his statements toward any individual in the United\r\nStates, any official?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I have no recollection that he directed his statements\r\nagainst anyone, Senator Cooper. I think that if he had, I would likely\r\nhave reported this matter. As a matter of fact, on the general subject\r\nof the molding of his attitudes, he was not very communicative.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was he technically correct there in his statement--I\r\nbelieve he said that his application was pending before the Supreme\r\nSoviet. Is that technically correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is technically correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may continue, Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, Mr. Snyder, on March 24, 1961, you sent a Foreign\r\nService Despatch to the Department indicating that you had received a\r\nsecond letter from Mr. Oswald on March 20, 1961, and you said that the\r\nletter was postmarked Minsk, March 5, and Moscow March 17. I would like\r\nto show you a Commission document which has been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 940, and ask you whether that is a copy of the Foreign\r\nService Despatch which you sent forth to the Department.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 940 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could this be very briefly summarized for the record while\r\nit is being read?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In this despatch, he sets forth the letter which Mr.\r\nOswald sent, which basically said that it would be hard for him to get\r\nto the Embassy in Moscow, and why can't they send the papers to Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These are the papers about his return?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, papers that he would have to fill out to see if he\r\nwas entitled to get his passport back.\r\n\r\nWould the witness identify the despatch? Is that the one you sent?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it that the first answer you got from the\r\nDepartment to your despatch of February 28, 1961, which is marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 932, indicating the first letter you received\r\nfrom Oswald, and then the second despatch marked Commission Exhibit No.\r\n940, was a State Department instruction dated April 13, 1961, which was\r\nmarked as Commission Exhibit No. 934.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 934 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that the despatch which you received?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And then again on May 26, 1961, you sent another\r\ndespatch to the State Department indicating that you received another\r\nletter from Oswald, and stating that you thought you would return to\r\nOswald his passport, and that has been marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n936.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 936 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Chairman, I note a reference in the margin here, in\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 934.\r\n\r\nDo you know whose handwriting that is in, Mr. Snyder?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir; that is my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What does that say?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It says, \"May be necessary give him before he can arrange\r\ndepart.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, Mr. Snyder, on or about July 10 or 11, 1961, Mr.\r\nOswald physically appeared at the American Embassy again, did he not?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I saw him once more--I believe once more--possibly\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Actually he came in on a Saturday, did he not, which was\r\nJuly 8, and then you saw him again on the following Monday, isn't that\r\ncorrect? Didn't you actually see him twice during that period?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think that I must have. As I say, I think I must have,\r\nbecause of my review of the record at the time indicates that I think\r\nI saw him on the 8th, and the application was taken on the 10th, which\r\nmeans, I presumably saw him twice.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall when he came into the Embassy on the 8th and\r\nwhat he said, and what you did?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; in fact, I have no recollection of his having come in\r\nat that time, Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In the course of these two interviews on the 8th and on\r\nthe 10th, he actually filled out an application for renewal of his\r\npassport, did he not?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you handled that application? That is correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I next have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 938, a six\r\npage document which purports to be an application for renewal of\r\npassport, together with a questionnaire which was attached thereto, and\r\nask you whether that is a copy of the application for renewal which you\r\nfilled out at that time.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 938 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. With reference to his visit on the 8th, it is possible that\r\nhe telephoned. Again, I don't know quite what our record shows on that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, to help you refresh your recollection, sir, there\r\nhas been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 935 a Foreign Service\r\nDespatch dated July 11, 1961, in which you described the meeting with\r\nOswald. Perhaps you would want to be reading that.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 935 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is the interview which I thought I had on the 10th.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What does it mean in this questionnaire\r\n[Commission Exhibit No. 938] where Oswald says, and I quote, \"I recived\r\n[sic] a document for residence in the U.S.S.R. but I am described as\r\nbeing 'Without Citizenship'\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This undoubtedly refers to his so-called internal Soviet\r\npassport, Mr. Ford. Every Soviet citizen living in urban areas, and\r\nalso in the border areas, bears an internal passport which identifies\r\nhim, has certain other information about him, and bears a notation\r\nof nationality. There are, as I recall, three varieties of this. One\r\nis for Soviet citizens, one is for citizens of foreign countries, I\r\nbelieve, and another is for stateless persons.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What is the last category?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Stateless persons. My mind is not clear at this stage as to\r\nwhether the passports for foreigners and stateless persons is the same\r\nor not. I don't quite recall. At any rate, there is an entry in there\r\nwhich asks to state his nationality. No, it is a separate passport. As\r\nI recall the title of it, it is called--it is a separate passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did the Soviet Union ever indicate to the Embassy, as far\r\nas you know, that they considered Oswald as stateless, or is that\r\nOswald's own statement?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. The only indication is the internal passport which he had,\r\nwhich was made out by local officials, and which may have been based\r\nupon a statement that Oswald himself made to them. He may have regarded\r\nhimself as being stateless, I don't know, at the time he applied for\r\nthat document.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And that did not necessarily require, as far as you know,\r\nreference to Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think the local authorities could have done that on\r\ntheir own, and on the information they got from Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; the term \"stateless,\" I might interject here, is used\r\nrather loosely by Soviet authorities, because, in the first place, they\r\nhave clearly no authority and no basis upon which to determine whether\r\na person is a citizen of a foreign state. I mean only the foreign state\r\ncan determine that.\r\n\r\nSo that the Soviet authorities had no basis on which to determine\r\nwhether Oswald was or was not a citizen of the United States or of six\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Except the fact that they had seen his passport and knew of\r\nthe existence of his American passport.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. On that basis, they would--well, he was certainly an\r\nAmerican citizen when he entered as far as they were concerned; yes,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is a person who is stateless the same as a person\r\nwho is \"without citizenship\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir; this distinction is only in translation, Mr. Ford.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, in the passport application, at the bottom\r\nthere is a place where you have to cross out \"have\" or \"have not\" in\r\nconnection with four questions. Could you read into the record the\r\nprinted part at the bottom of the application?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you just clarify for us what application this is?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This is the application for the passport renewal which\r\nOswald signed----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For the American passport to return to the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, this is a renewal of the passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A renewal of the passport to return to the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It says, \"I have--have not--been naturalized as a citizen\r\nof a foreign state; taken an oath or made an affirmation or other\r\nformal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state; entered or\r\nserved in, the armed forces of a foreign state; accepted, served in,\r\nor performed the duties of, any office, post or employment under\r\nthe government of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof;\r\nvoted in a political election in a foreign state or participated in\r\nan election or plebiscite to determine the sovereignty over foreign\r\nterritory; made a formal renunciation of nationality, either in the\r\nUnited States or before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United\r\nStates in a foreign state; been convicted by court martial of deserting\r\nthe military, air or naval service of the United States in time of war,\r\nor of committing any act of treason against or of attempting by force\r\nto overthrow, or of bearing arms against the United States; or departed\r\nfrom or remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States for the\r\npurpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military,\r\nair or naval forces of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"If any of the above-mentioned acts or conditions are applicable to the\r\napplicant's case, or to the case of any other person included in this\r\napplication, a supplementary statement under oath should be attached\r\nand made a part hereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, as I read the application, what you did was to\r\ncross out the \"have not\" which means that Oswald was stating that he\r\nhad done one of those acts which you have read, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is what it would mean.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Which one of the various acts that you have read was it\r\nyour impression that Oswald was admitting that he had done?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, there are two possibilities here. One possibility is\r\nthat the crossing out of \"have not\" is a clerical error, and that he\r\ndid not intend to do this.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How could that be a possibility. Don't you pretty much\r\nnegate that possibility by the fact that you did require him to fill\r\nout the questionnaire which only has to be filled out if he admits that\r\nhe has done one of the various acts?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; the questionnaire is filled out routinely in Moscow in\r\nany kind of problem case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Even though the citizen has done none of the acts which\r\nare set forth in the passport renewal application?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; well, I say in a problem case. I don't mean an\r\nAmerican tourist coming in to get his passport renewed, on whom there\r\nis no presumption of any problem at all. But a person who has resided\r\nin the Soviet Union----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is it your testimony this is only a typographical error?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This is one possibility. The other possibility is that he\r\nmay have said, \"I have taken an oath or made an affirmation or formal\r\ndeclaration of allegiance to a foreign state.\"\r\n\r\nHe had, on several occasions, you know, stated that his allegiance was\r\nto the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nHe may have put this down--that is, he may have said \"have\", having\r\nthat act in mind, knowing that I knew it, and that there was no need to\r\nattempt to hide the fact. This is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall just what you had in mind on July 10 when he\r\ngave you that application filled out in the manner it was?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am sorry, I don't think I understand the question.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then I will withdraw it and rephrase it. Do you now recall\r\nwhat reaction you had in mind when you received the application which\r\nhad been crossed out in such a way that indicated that he was admitting\r\nthat he had done one of the various acts which are set forth on the\r\nform?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't. Of course what I would have been concerned\r\nwith at the time in more detail really is the questionnaire, which\r\nis an expansion of this paragraph, and is much more meaningful. So I\r\nwould have been concerned both with what he said on the questionnaire\r\nand with the facts of his case--whether he thought he committed one of\r\nthese acts is not material to the fact of whether he had committed it\r\nor whether he lost his citizenship thereby.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, my attention would have been directed to the expanded\r\nquestionnaire in which he had to fill out individual paragraphs\r\nconcerning each one of these things, and to a determination of the\r\nfacts in the case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you recall whether or not that striking out was noted at\r\nthe time the passport application or extension was considered?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I do not, Mr. Dulles; no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have his file out and looking at it,\r\nreading it, studying at the time he was there and this came up?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I presume I did, Mr. Ford, but--I am sure his file was\r\nthere. But in any event, I was the officer handling his case. Having\r\nwritten virtually everything in the file from the outgoing point of\r\nview, I was very well familiar with it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In any event, having received the questionnaire and the\r\napplication, you determined that Mr. Oswald was entitled to an American\r\npassport, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you sent forward the application and the questionnaire\r\nin the Foreign Service Despatch of July 11, 1961, which has been marked\r\nExhibit No. 935, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And your recommendation was that the passport should\r\nissue--the passport office should issue a new passport, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I would issue the passport; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And also on the same day, at the end of the interview on\r\nJuly 10, 1961, you returned to Mr. Oswald the American passport which\r\nhe had given you in 1959. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Didn't you stamp that passport before you returned it\r\nto him? I show you Commission Exhibit No. 946 and ask you would you\r\nindicate to the Commission----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question before the witness answers this\r\nquestion? Was that application and questionnaire considered in the\r\nState Department before the passport was issued, or was the passport\r\nissued on general instructions before they received this application?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I will have to correct a word we used before. It is\r\nrenewal, and not issuance.\r\n\r\nHis passport was good for another 2 years if we renewed, and he was\r\napplying for renewal of his passport, not issuance of a new one.\r\n\r\nIn either event, the issuance or renewal would have been done by the\r\nEmbassy, by me.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The problem, Mr. Dulles, is the existing passport he had,\r\nby its term, would expire September 1961, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you felt he would not be able to get out of the Soviet\r\nUnion prior to September 1961, and therefore his existing passport\r\nwould have to be renewed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't recall offhand what the purpose of renewing the\r\npassport at that time was. There was no prospect of his leaving the\r\nSoviet Union at that time, and probably not for quite some time to\r\ncome, in my estimation, and based upon my experience with other cases\r\nhe would have required his passport, and I presume this is why I was\r\nreturning it to him.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. On July 10, 1961, you did two things with respect to the\r\npassport. First, you returned to him his old passport, isn't that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think I did. I might reread my despatch and see.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And, second, you accepted his application for renewal of\r\nthe passport.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; my mind is clear on that. Yes; I recall now.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When you returned to him his old passport, you first\r\nstamped the old passport.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Will you indicate for the record how you stamped the old\r\npassport?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. The passport was marked \"This passport is valid only for\r\ndirect travel to the United States.\" (Commission Exhibit No. 946, p. 6.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are you quite clear you returned the passport to him before\r\nhe made his final plans to return?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am not entirely----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, before you answer the question, I suggest if you look\r\nat the Foreign Office Despatch dated July 11, 1961, you will find that\r\nyou told the Department what you did at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could that be read into the record--just what he did say\r\nabout the handling of the passport at that time--that is July what?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. July 8, 1961.\r\n\r\nThis was July 8. \"Oswald intends to institute an application\"----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Pardon me. Wasn't it really July 10? July 8 was the day he\r\ncame over to the Embassy just for a few moments. Then he came back on\r\nthe 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't know. It isn't clear from my despatch, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you read----\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Actually, if we knew what day of the week the 8th was----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Subject to check, it was a Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. \"Oswald intends to institute an application for an exit\r\nvisa immediately upon his return to Minsk within the next few days. His\r\nAmerican passport was returned to him for this purpose after having\r\nbeen amended to be valid for direct travel--for direct return to the\r\nUnited States only.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In that same Foreign Service Despatch you indicated at the\r\nend that you were sending to the Passport Office in Washington the\r\napplication for renewal, isn't that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask Mr. Snyder--on Commission Exhibit No.\r\n938, where Oswald said, \"I have been naturalized as a citizen of a\r\nforeign state,\" and so forth--if that was the only statement that was\r\nmade, what effect would that have had on his application either for a\r\nrenewal or a new passport?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, it would have the effect of flagging the consular\r\nofficer to ask some questions, Mr. Ford.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would it have automatically disqualified him for\r\nrenewal or the issuance of a new passport?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Not under the law or the regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not to the best of my knowledge. In other words, what\r\nhe says, to my knowledge, is immaterial to a finding of his loss of\r\nnationality. It is the act which counts.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I don't think that is quite the Congressman's question.\r\nHis question is if he had actually naturalized himself, could he be\r\nentitled to get an American passport?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, no; of course, if he had committed the act of accepting\r\nnaturalization in a foreign state, he could not have. He would have\r\nlost his American citizenship.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But limiting your knowledge to what he said in\r\nthis paragraph, this in and of itself would have precluded either the\r\nissuance of a new passport or renewal?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't think we can say that, Mr. Ford, because no\r\nmatter what he says in there, this does not affect his right--does not\r\naffect his American citizenship. It is the determination of facts which\r\ndetermines it. And the only thing this does, really--well, the first\r\nthing it does is to alert the consular officer to start asking him some\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, I have a call from the Court. I must go over\r\nthere now. We have the Court conference at 2 o'clock. Will someone be\r\nhere to preside at 2 o'clock?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, I have to leave, too. We have a\r\nquorum call over on the floor of the House. I can be back at 2. But I\r\ndo have to leave at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you be back at 2 to preside until I return from the\r\nCourt?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I would be very glad to, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I will be able to be here part of the\r\ntime this afternoon. But we are voting this afternoon. I don't know\r\nexactly what time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I will be here at 2:30, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, fine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask how much longer you intend to go on?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I think I can finish in about 4 minutes with Mr. Snyder.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nWe will recess now until 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:25 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RICHARD EDWARD SNYDER RESUMED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The Commission will come to order. Will you\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 947,\r\nwhich is a covering airgram and another copy of the application for\r\nrenewal of passport, which is a copy which remained in the Embassy at\r\nMoscow until May 29, 1964, when it was sent to the State Department.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 947 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show it to you, sir, to call your attention that on this\r\ncopy the \"X\" is over the \"have\" rather than the \"have not.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I had originally shown you Exhibit No. 938, which was the\r\nother copy of the application for renewal of passport.\r\n\r\nI take it when you compare those two copies, you note that one is not a\r\ndirect offset of the other.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you have an explanation of why on July 10, two separate\r\ntypings were made of the application for renewal?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Also on or about July 11, 1961, at the same time you were\r\ninterviewing Oswald, the State Department was sending instructions,\r\nanswering your earlier despatch of May 26, 1961, is that correct?\r\n\r\nI show you Commission Exhibit No. 937.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 937 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This communication would have been received after my\r\ndeparture from Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You never saw that communication?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That communication does indicate, doesn't it, that the\r\nState Department was saying, that based upon its records, that Oswald\r\nhad not expatriated himself, or was still technically an American\r\ncitizen?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; the one operative sentence there in the communications\r\nstates, \"In any event in the absence of evidence showing that Mr.\r\nOswald had definitely lost United States citizenship he apparently\r\nmaintains that technical status.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. But you say you never saw that document?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; this arrived after I departed from the post.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 939, the State\r\nDepartment operations memorandum dated August 18, 1961, and ask you if\r\nyou saw it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; it arrived after I left.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 939 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. On July 8 and July 10, when Oswald was at the Embassy, did\r\nyou see his wife, Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you have any knowledge that she was also in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't really know. I can't say whether at that time I had\r\nknowledge that she was or not. I don't ever recall having seen her, no.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When you spoke to Oswald on the 8th or on the 10th of\r\nJuly, did he indicate that his wife was in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am sorry, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In connection with the various decisions you have made in\r\nthis matter, did you consult with anyone?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think perhaps the word \"consult\" isn't quite the word. I\r\nkept my superiors informed of what I was doing, and, of course, they\r\ndid see my communications, and in most cases countersigned them before\r\nthey went out. But in the sense of asking their opinion of what I ought\r\nto do, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did anyone instruct you as to what particular decision you\r\nshould make in connection with any requests made by Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; this was my responsibility, really. There was no one\r\nwho was presumed to know more about it at the post than I did. I mean\r\nin the sense that I was the officer in charge of that activity.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. There is one other question, sir.\r\n\r\nWe have some information that Oswald stated that in 1959, when he\r\nwas in the hospital, that he was in the same ward with an elderly\r\nAmerican. Do you have any idea who the elderly American could have been?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I am afraid not.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would there be any record in the Embassy which would\r\nindicate what Americans were in Moscow at that time, and whether there\r\nwas an elderly American who had been hospitalized?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. We kept an informal file of all information relating to the\r\npresence of Americans any place in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn other words, any time we had a report of any kind, of any level of\r\ncredibility, we kept some kind of a record. It was known that there\r\nwere Americans in the Soviet Union under various circumstances against\r\ntheir own will, or persons who might be Americans, or might have had a\r\nclaim to American citizenship, who might have been dual nationals--one\r\ndoesn't know. But we would get reports occasionally from a state camp,\r\na labor camp, of a sighting of an American, or a person who claimed to\r\nbe an American. This sort of thing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would that information be in a special file in the\r\nEmbassy, or would it be spread throughout various files?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; it was in, as I recall, a separate informal listing. In\r\nother words, they were also reported to the Department of State. The\r\nchances are that the Department also maintained----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Have you any idea what that file might be called, if we\r\nwere going to ask for it by name--what name we would give so that the\r\npeople in Moscow would know what we are trying to take a look at?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't. But it would most likely have been under\r\n\"Welfare and Whereabouts.\" The files in Moscow, I might say, the\r\nclassified files are not that extensive. I mean they were one-drawer\r\nfiles for the most part that we officers worked on ourselves,\r\nphysically.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When Oswald came in to see you in 1959, did you have any\r\nfeeling that somebody was coaching him, or had instructed him what to\r\nsay or do?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, I think I am accurate in saying at that time I\r\nassumed he had been in contact with some level of Soviet representative\r\nor official and had discussed his intended actions, and perhaps had had\r\nsome advice from them as to what to do or how to approach things--in\r\nthe sense that his words were somebody else's, I don't think I could\r\nsay, because he gave me the impression, the times I saw him, of an\r\nintelligent person who spoke in a manner, and on a level, which seemed\r\nto befit his apparent level of intelligence.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did say in my first interview with him either \"I have been\r\ntold what you are going to tell me,\" or \"I am very familiar with the\r\narguments you are going to use on me,\" or words to this effect, which\r\nwould be the most direct evidence, shall we say, that he had discussed\r\nwhat he intended to say, and how he intended to handle himself, before\r\nhe came in to me.\r\n\r\nBut, in any event, I think it is a foregone conclusion, from what I\r\nknow of the procedures and things like this, that he was in contact\r\nwith a Soviet official, he was under somebody's charge in a sense\r\nduring the time he was there. This was certainly the pattern in the\r\nPetrulli case. My whole knowledge of the system and the way it works,\r\nthe whole internal consistency of it, would lead me to believe that\r\nthis were the case, unless I had firm evidence to believe otherwise.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How about when he reappeared on July 8 and 10, 1961? Did\r\nyou feel he was being coached at that time in connection with his\r\nattempt to get his passport returned to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't have any direct evidence that he was coached,\r\nI think, in the terms in which you mean. For one thing, his manner of\r\nspeech and his general approach to the degree that I recall it was,\r\nwell, less stiff, less formal, and certainly less haughty than it\r\nhad been on the first occasion. He also didn't use with me the kind\r\nof Marxist sloganeering which I got from him on the first interview,\r\nwhich also, I think, is in a sense an evidence of his having been well\r\nbriefed on his talk with me.\r\n\r\nThe second time around this was pretty much absent from his\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say you felt he was well briefed on his first\r\nconversation with you in 1959, but not in connection with his second?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, again, I cannot say that he was well briefed. I just\r\ndon't know. But I say, it seemed to me evident at the time that he had\r\ndiscussed with, presumably, a Soviet person or persons what he intended\r\nto do at the Embassy, and perhaps the line he should take at the\r\nEmbassy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, how do you feel or do you think there is any special\r\nsignificance to the way he entered the Soviet Union from Helsinki in\r\nOctober of 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, there is some significance perhaps, but not a great\r\namount of significance. As most travelers, most tourist travelers\r\ncome into the Soviet Union on a prearranged tour--many do come\r\nfrom Helsinki. Many of them do not come to Moscow. They go only to\r\nLeningrad, spend a day or two, and go back again across the border.\r\nIt is the shortest entry onto Soviet territory from non-Communist\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIt was at least one other case, when I was in Moscow, of a person--that\r\nis with possible defecting intent, who came into the Soviet Union\r\nthrough Helsinki, and who got his visa apparently directly at the\r\nSoviet Embassy, which I think is what Oswald did, although I cannot\r\nbe sure. But it was my impression at the time that he did not have a\r\nprepared tourist tour sort of thing. But I cannot be sure on this point.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you draw any significance from the fact that he was\r\nable to come from Minsk into Moscow on July 8, apparently without any\r\ndifficulty?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I cannot say that he came without any difficulty. He\r\nmay have had considerable difficulty. It was my feeling that he would\r\nhave some difficulty in coming to Moscow.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you make any inquiry about that? Did that\r\nrouse your curiosity, that he was able to come?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; because I expected that he would be able to come, Mr.\r\nFord. As a matter of fact, the letter which I wrote to him in reply to\r\nthe first letter to me which I received was very carefully worded with\r\nthis in mind. It was written, for one thing, partly addressed to the\r\nSoviet authorities who would read it. And partly to Oswald--which could\r\nbe used by him in a sense should he run up against real difficulties in\r\ngetting permission to come to Moscow.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I think it was my feeling at the time that he probably\r\ncould come to the Embassy, although it might cost him considerable\r\ndifficulty. But I saw no reason to spare him this difficulty.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is there any other information you have which you think\r\nthe Commission would be interested in in connection with its work and\r\nits investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I can't really--well, let me say that I don't know of any\r\nother facts pertinent to the investigation, or pertinent to Oswald in\r\nany way which I have not presented, at least not knowingly.\r\n\r\nThere may well be--there is much that I could elaborate on, on what I\r\nhave said, relating to Oswald. There are a good deal of small things\r\nwhich perhaps under further questioning might be elicited.\r\n\r\nBut I am not aware of anything which I have not mentioned and which is\r\nin any way pertinent, and which ought to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere are other observations about Oswald and this sort of thing I\r\nsuppose I could elaborate on to some extent.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Earlier in the interrogation, Mr. Coleman had you\r\noutline what transpired the day that Oswald walked into the Embassy, in\r\nthe first instance?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The Commission has in the various papers picked\r\nup following Oswald's apprehension and murder, what purports to be his\r\nobservations or his diary during his stay in the Soviet Union. Have you\r\nread any of those?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He describes in one of these documents his\r\nexperience that day he came into the Embassy. Would you in some detail\r\nrelate that again, as you understand what transpired? What time of day\r\nit was, where you were, in what office, and so forth. Who was with you,\r\nif anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I might begin, I think, as I began originally, by stating\r\nthat I don't recall the time of day. But from my knowledge of the facts\r\nof the case, and the fact that I told him the Embassy was closed and so\r\nforth, it had to have been either a Wednesday or a Saturday afternoon,\r\nif not a Sunday. I am told that the date on which he came actually was\r\na Saturday, so I presume it was a Saturday afternoon that he came.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Don't spare of the detail, because it would be\r\ninteresting to get your version and his as he purportedly related it in\r\na document of his own subsequently.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am not sure whether he was brought in to me or whether\r\nI went out and met him at the door and brought him in. I don't recall\r\nwhether one of my secretaries might have been on duty that afternoon.\r\nNormally, she would not have been.\r\n\r\nI believe that Mr. McVickar was working in the office adjoining mine.\r\nThe offices in Moscow are quite small and the door between our offices\r\nis usually open. And I think that Mr. McVickar told me he was in the\r\nnext office.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the office with me at the time I saw him.\r\n\r\nOswald was well dressed and very neat appearing when he came in. I\r\ndon't recall whether he was wearing a suit and shirt and tie. But at\r\nany rate, his appearance impressed me at the time. And I recall that he\r\nlooked very presentable.\r\n\r\nHe was very curt, very proper. At no time did he insult me or anything\r\nof that sort personally. He was just proper, but extremely curt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he just walk in the door and you were seated\r\nat your desk? What was the way in which you first spoke to one another?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't recall whether he was ushered into my office by the\r\nsecretary or one of the employees, or whether I was told that there was\r\nsomeone waiting for me outside, and I went and got him. It is unlikely\r\nthat he walked into the offices, because he would have had to walk\r\nthrough two other offices to get to mine.\r\n\r\nWell, he stated--he gave me a written statement, which is in the\r\nrecord, almost immediately upon his arrival, I believe.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is Commission Exhibit No. 913.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. He stated in effect that he had come to the Soviet Union\r\nto live in the Soviet Union, that he desired to renounce his American\r\ncitizenship, though I don't think he used the word \"renounce\"--I think\r\nhe used another word--but that he desired to renounce his American\r\ncitizenship. That his allegiance was to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nI think initially this was pretty much what his statement was. And\r\nwould I please do what was necessary to get this over with.\r\n\r\nWell, during this period of the interview, as far as I recall, he was\r\nstanding. And he may have seated himself some time later in it. But I\r\nthink for the initial part of the interview, he remained standing and\r\ndeclined to take a seat.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to question him, he then rejoined with words to the\r\neffect, \"I know what\" or \"I have been told what you are going to ask\r\nme, you are going to try to talk me out of this, and don't waste your\r\ntime, please let's get on with the business.\"\r\n\r\nI then asked him--I continued to probe and see where I could find a\r\nchink in his armor some place.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that the initial chink which I found was regarding his\r\nrelatives and place of residence in the United States.\r\n\r\nI had his passport. I don't recall whether he handed it to me, though\r\nhe probably did, or whether I asked him for it.\r\n\r\nI noted that on the inside of the cover page of his passport his home\r\naddress had been crossed out.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked him where he lived, he declined to tell me. When I asked\r\nhim about his relatives--I had noted from his passport that he was 20\r\nyears old. When I asked him about his relatives, he also said this was\r\nnone of my business, and would I please get on with the business.\r\n\r\nWell, I told him at that time, or fairly early in the interview, having\r\nfound this kind of chink I could work on, I told him that I would have\r\nto know certainly where he lived in the United States in order to do\r\nanything else with his case.\r\n\r\nAt that stage, he kind of hemmed and hawed a bit and said--well, I live\r\nat so and so. And from there on it opened the crack a little bit, and I\r\nfound his mother also lived at that--that this was the address of his\r\nmother, and probing further I found out about his Marine background,\r\nand that he had been recently discharged.\r\n\r\nI questioned him a bit about where he had applied for his passport, and\r\nhow he had come to the Soviet Union, and had he gone home to see his\r\nmother, and things of this sort.\r\n\r\nSome of these questions he answered, and some he didn't. However, he\r\ndid not seem quite, as I recall--quite so adamant about refusing this\r\nkind of question as he did about questions closer to the bone. That\r\nis, what knowledge do you have of Marxism, or where did you first come\r\nacross this, or did you meet someone in the Marines?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you go into those questions in your probing\r\nwith him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; this sort of question he parried. I won't say he\r\nparried them--he simply refused to answer them. The only thing which he\r\ndid say in the interview was \"I am a Marxist.\" And I recall telling him\r\nthen in a jocular vein, which evoked no response, that he was going to\r\nbe a very lonesome man in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nBut I found at that point, and from there on, that for all I could\r\ndetermine he was completely humorless. And this was my impression of\r\nhim on the other occasions on which I saw him. He was intense and\r\nhumorless.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted the breakup of the interview, or the\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, the interview finally broke up when I couldn't get\r\nany more out of him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he satisfied or dissatisfied with the result\r\nof his conference with you?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think he was dissatisfied, if anything. I think he had\r\ncome in there to renounce his citizenship, and had found himself\r\nthwarted. It is quite possible, though, this is reading into it\r\nthings which were not necessarily evident to me at the time. It is\r\nquite possible that this was to be his big moment on the stage of\r\nhistory as far as he was concerned. He may have contemplated this for\r\nsome time, as he said--and thus my refusal at that time to complete\r\nhis renunciation may have been a hurdle which he had been totally\r\nunprepared for.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he demand at any time that this was a right he\r\nhad to renounce his citizenship, and demand why you would not permit\r\nhim to proceed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, I cannot really reconstruct our conversations on that\r\nline. But I clearly pointed out to him his right. And he did decline,\r\nas I recall, to have me read the law to him. He said he was familiar\r\nwith it, or something, so that I need not read the law to him. So I\r\npointed out, I believe, at that time he had a right, as any citizen has\r\na right to give up his citizenship if he so desires.\r\n\r\nThat other consideration is that the consul has a certain obligation\r\ntowards the individual, and also towards his family, to see that a\r\nperson--or that the consul at least does not aid and encourage an\r\nindividual, and particularly a 20-year-old individual, to commit an\r\nirrevocable act on the spur of the moment or without adequate thought.\r\n\r\nBut I told him in any event that the consulate was closed that\r\nafternoon, that I had no secretary there to prepare the papers, and\r\nthat if he would come back during normal business hours I would, of\r\ncourse, go through with it.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that he left the room happy--if I can use that\r\nterm--in his attitude towards me.\r\n\r\nI recall probing a bit on the subject of the formation of his attitudes\r\ntowards Marxism. I developed at this time the impression that he really\r\nhad no knowledgeable background at all of Marxism. I think I asked him\r\nif he could tell me a little bit about the theory of labor value, or\r\nsomething like that, and he hadn't the faintest notion of what I was\r\ntalking about--I mean something basic to Marxism. And I probed around a\r\nbit as to the sources of his attitudes. And I think the only thing he\r\ntold me at the time was that he had been doing some reading, and that\r\nis about as far as I got. On that subject, he simply would not be drawn\r\nout.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ask him anything about his knowledge of\r\nthe Russian language? Did he volunteer anything?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I did ask him a bit about that. He said he had been\r\nstudying Russian. And, again, I had the impression--I don't recall--I\r\nmay have spoken some Russian to him--but I at least formed the\r\nimpression that he did not know very much Russian. I don't think he\r\ncould have gotten along on his own in Russian society. I don't think he\r\ncould have done more than buy a piece of bread, maybe.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he converse with any other member of the staff\r\nat the Embassy, to your knowledge, during the time of this first visit?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, no; at this time he definitely did not. And I don't\r\nthink that he did during the time I was there--unless it was simply a\r\npassing word with the receptionist, or something of this sort.\r\n\r\nBut as far as I know, he had no knowledgeable conversation with anyone\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nActually, there were only--well, when he first came there were only two\r\nofficers, McVickar and myself, and at the time I left, three officers,\r\nwith whom he might have talked. And it is inconceivable that either of\r\nthe other two officers would have talked to him, knowing my interest in\r\nthe case, or if I were not there somebody would have done so without\r\nmaking a memo for the file and for me of the conversation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In retrospect, assuming the tragic events that\r\ndid transpire last year didn't take place, and this circumstance was\r\npresented to you again in the Embassy in Moscow, would you handle the\r\ncase any differently?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't think so, Mr. Ford. You mean in terms of would\r\nI have taken his renunciation? No; I think not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you would have put him off, or\r\nstalled him off, in this first interview, make him come back again?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; I would have.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Particularly, since he was a minor. Normally, it would have\r\nbeen, I think, my practice to do this in any event, though. Obviously\r\nno two cases are alike, and the consul must decide. But particularly\r\nin the case of a minor, I could not imagine myself writing out the\r\nrenunciation form and having him sign it, on the spot, without making\r\nhim leave my office and come back at some other time, even if it is\r\nonly a few hours intervening.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In one of the despatches I believe you sent to\r\nWashington, you indicated that you had informed the press--I don't\r\nrecall what exhibit that is.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think I said, \"Press informed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 910, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You say, \"Press informed.\" Is that the same as\r\ninforming the press?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; this simply----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the difference?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This simply tells the Department that the press is onto\r\nthe case, and that they can expect something from Moscow on it. The\r\nDepartment hates to be caught by surprise, they hate to read something\r\nin the newspapers before they have gotten it back home. And I am simply\r\ntelling them that the Moscow press corps is aware of Oswald's presence,\r\nand that there would likely be some dispatches from the press from\r\nMoscow on the case.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That doesn't mean the Embassy informed the press?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How did you know the press had been informed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Again right at the moment, I cannot say. At what\r\nstage--Priscilla Johnson, I think, was one of the first to be aware of\r\nOswald. Just how she became aware of him, and just where I became aware\r\nof her knowledge of him, I don't quite know. But this, I think, was\r\nquite early in the game.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he given much attention by the press in\r\nMoscow?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I cannot really speak with great authority on the point. I\r\ndon't think so. This is based on several things.\r\n\r\nOne, there was very little about Oswald, I think, at the time other\r\nthan what was sent in by Priscilla Johnson.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that Oswald himself had declined to talk to some\r\nother press persons of the American press corps.\r\n\r\nPriscilla, as I recall, was the only one who seemed to have an entree\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you did not inform the American press in\r\nMoscow of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever talk to any of the American press or\r\nany other of the press, about Oswald at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; not that I recall, Mr. Ford. It was my normal practice\r\nnot to discuss cases of this kind. They were occurring all the time in\r\nMoscow. If it wasn't one kind it was another. And it was my practice\r\nnot to discuss the details of such cases with the press simply because\r\nthe cases--each one being different in any event--the cases were always\r\nticklish. And every little bit helped or hurt in a case of this kind.\r\nAnd the consul needed, to the extent possible, to minimize the forces\r\nacting on the case, so that--and the press understood this very well.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were you familiar with his interview with Miss\r\nMosby?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't recall that I was. I knew that Priscilla Johnson\r\nhad seen him and had been seeing him.\r\n\r\nBut I don't recall that I was aware that Ellie Mosby had seen him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You were acquainted with Miss Mosby as well as\r\nPriscilla Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; very well.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are any of these stories that these correspondents\r\nwrite on these defector cases ever checked out with your office, or\r\npeople, in corresponding position?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Normally not, I would say.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were you at all aware of the 5,000 rubles that\r\nOswald was given by Soviet authorities or by an agency of the Soviet\r\nUnion which is sometimes called, I guess, the Red Cross? Are you at all\r\naware of that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are you aware of that organization in the Soviet\r\nUnion?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you describe it for us, as far as you know\r\nwhat it is?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 5,000 rubles--excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This was the old rubles at that time. No; I don't----\r\n\r\nMr DULLES. For the record, what was the date of the change in the value\r\nof the ruble? I think I remember it. It was around 1960--May-June of\r\n1960, I think.\r\n\r\nWhen it went into effect, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I am sorry, I don't either, Mr. Dulles. It was during my\r\nterm there. It seemed to me it was in the second half of my tour in\r\nMoscow. But I cannot really recall.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think somewhere in the record that ought to appear. I\r\nhave an idea it was May of 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. January 1, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is when it went into effect?\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. It was officially revalued.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. January 1, 1961--let the record show that--the ruble was\r\nrevalued, so that it took about 10 rubles to make 1 new ruble.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So 5,000 rubles in 1959 was not an inconsequential\r\namount.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It wasn't very much.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; but 5,000 rubles at that time was probably two-thirds\r\nto three-quarters of the monthly salary of an average Soviet worker.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you describe----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. About $500, isn't it, roughly--10 to 1 in those days?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Wait a minute; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was a considerable sum.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It would be more than a month's salary, then.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes; an average month's salary at the time was about 750\r\nrubles, something around there.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think the legal rate was 20 cents, but the sort of going\r\nrate was around 10, I think. I think you could buy tourist rubles\r\naround 10, as I recall--10 to the dollar. The legal rate, I think, was\r\n5 to the dollar.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I think the legal rate was 10 to a dollar, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In the same letter that states the date, which we supplied\r\nto the Commission at the Commission's request, it states that the legal\r\nrate was 4 to 1 until January 1961. But that was the official rate.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I understand.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. There were different rates. The official rate was not the\r\nrate which was used for all things. For instance, we got 10 to 1 for\r\nour rubles. The so-called official rate was used, for instance, in\r\nclearing foreign trade accounts and this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you tell us your impression of this so-called\r\nRed Cross in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, again, I cannot speak of--about the Soviet Red Cross\r\nwith any great personal knowledge. It is not a Red Cross organization\r\nin quite the sense in which we know it. It is clearly an organ of the\r\nState in a totalitarian state, which means it is not an independent\r\norganization, and its policies flow from the policy of the state, and\r\nof the central committee.\r\n\r\nI don't think that the Soviet Red Cross conducts public fund-raising\r\ncampaigns, for instance, in the way ours does.\r\n\r\nIt also is not an organization to which an individual might turn\r\nroutinely for assistance as he might in our society.\r\n\r\nSince the Soviet State does not admit that there is need in the Soviet\r\nUnion, that there can be poverty or difficulty for which there are not\r\norganizations already in existence who are fully competent to deal with\r\nsuch problems, since they don't admit this kind of a situation--they\r\nalso do not admit of public welfare organs in a sense such as the Red\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you know of any other cases during your period\r\nof service there where there were payments by this organization to\r\nAmerican citizens, or Americans, those who had given up or tried to\r\ngive up or failed to give up their citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; as a matter of fact, the only way in which the\r\nSoviet Red Cross impinged upon my experience in Moscow was that they\r\nwere the organ for handling whereabouts inquiries of persons living in\r\nthe Soviet Union. If an American citizen wrote to the Embassy asking\r\nour assistance in locating a relative in the Soviet Union, this inquiry\r\nwould go from us to the Soviet Red Cross, who was charged under the\r\nSoviet system of things with actually checking into it and letting us\r\nknow if they felt that was in their interest. This was the only way in\r\nwhich the Soviet Red Cross impinged upon us.\r\n\r\nI do recall on a few occasions advising persons who had come into the\r\nEmbassy in one way or another and who were in dire need that they go to\r\nthe Soviet Red Cross.\r\n\r\nBut the reaction of such persons indicated to me that they felt the\r\nSoviet Red Cross was not the place to go.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Snyder, had you ever heard, while you were in the\r\nEmbassy in Moscow, the secret police referred to as the Red Cross?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You never heard the MVD, for example, referred to in that\r\nway?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; to my knowledge--I mean there is an organization called\r\nthe Soviet Red Cross, which carries on at least in the international\r\nsphere some of the normal activities of international Red Cross\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe big point of departure is that they on the one hand are not\r\nindependent organizations as they are in free societies, but they are\r\nan organ of the state. And, secondly, I do not think they have the\r\nsame role internally that our Red Cross organizations do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you heard of it being used in other instances for what\r\nmight be called extraneous payments--that is, payments not related to\r\nRed Cross work?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there a policy that you were familiar with, as\r\nfar as the Soviet Union was concerned, for permitting a person to apply\r\nfor and be given Soviet citizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; there is a well-defined way of acquiring Soviet\r\ncitizenship under Soviet law.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was Oswald familiar with that, as you could tell\r\nfrom your conversation with him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, he obviously was familiar with what one does. That\r\nis, he had made application to the Supreme Soviet, which is what one\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He did?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes, sir; this is not something which is common knowledge.\r\nOne would have to have inquired and found out, and had someone show you\r\nor give you the proper form on which to make application, and tell you\r\nwhere to address it, and this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did he tell you had happened when he did that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. All he said was that he had made application.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He didn't indicate the application had been\r\nprocessed and approved?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I cannot recall what our conversation was on that\r\nscore. It was quite clear that he had not received Soviet citizenship.\r\n\r\nBut, also, I would not have expected him to receive it that early in\r\nthe game. I mean, for one thing the Supreme Soviet does not act on\r\nthese things on a continuing basis, but acts upon them periodically.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. En masse, so to speak?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is right. It has them on its calendar. So many times a\r\nyear it acts on petitions for Soviet citizenship, presumably.\r\n\r\nPresumably before it is sent to the Supreme Soviet with a favorable\r\nrecommendation by the various Government organs, a thorough\r\ninvestigation is made by MVD and other organs, and various officials\r\npresumably at different levels have got to stick their necks out and\r\nrecommend he be accepted--that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If you had known that Oswald was in Minsk, what\r\nwould your reaction have been?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Serves him right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. You have never been in Minsk.\r\n\r\nWell, in the first place, my own feeling is that there is no better\r\nmedicine for someone who imagines he likes the Soviet Union than to\r\nlive there awhile.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Any place.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am more particularly interested in Minsk.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. But provincial towns in the Soviet Union are a very large\r\nstep below the capital, and the capital, believe me, is a fairly\r\ngood-sized step down from any American populated place.\r\n\r\nBut the difference between large cities and minor cities, and between\r\nminor cities and villages, is a tremendous step backward in time. And\r\nto live in Minsk, or any other provincial city in the Soviet Union, is\r\na pretty grim experience to someone who has lived in our society--not\r\nnecessarily American, but simply in western society. It might be just\r\nthe same if he lived in Denmark, or some place. I mean to land up in\r\nMinsk, working in a grubby little factory is quite a comedown.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you ever been in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I spent about an hour walking around Minsk, between trains,\r\none time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there anything significant about him being sent\r\nto Minsk, as far as you are concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, no; the only pattern that I would discern is that it is\r\nin all cases to my knowledge--all cases of which I have had knowledge,\r\nthe invariable pattern of the Soviets is to send defectors somewhere\r\noutside of the capital city--to settle them in some city other than\r\nMoscow. There have been some minor exceptions to this.\r\n\r\nWhat is the name--the British defector, and the two foreign office men\r\nBurgess and McLean. McLean lives or did live, until his death, just on\r\nthe outskirts of Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. McLean is still alive.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Pardon me--Burgess. Is Burgess the one married to an\r\nAmerican?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Philby is married to an American.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. One of the two, Burgess or McLean, is married to an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. McLean is.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I had an interview with McLean's mother-in-law at the\r\nEmbassy. At any rate, this was one exception.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It has been alleged that in Minsk there are\r\ncertain training schools for foreigners, or possibly for citizens of\r\nthe Soviet Union. Are you at all familiar with that? Is there any\r\ninformation you have on it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I have not, Mr. Ford.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever contact any Soviet officials about\r\nOswald at the time of this first interview?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that unusual or is that usual?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It is usual.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you, in your capacity, would not\r\nnormally contact a Soviet official about someone such as Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. That is right; yes, sir. In other words, there is nothing\r\nat that stage of the game which--for which I would have any reason to\r\ngo to the Soviet authorities.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Even the fact that he had a visa 5 days overdue?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, of course, I am already aware in a sense and\r\nam acting under my awareness that he is living under controlled\r\ncircumstances. He is not simply living in a hotel and nobody knows\r\nabout it. That he is in contact with Soviet authorities, and is there\r\nwith their knowledge and consent. So that----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is implied consent, even though it may not be\r\nofficial as far as the documents are concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, actually, the document itself is quite eloquent on\r\nthis subject, I think. There is the very negative fact that his visa is\r\n5 days overdue, and he is still there--that speaks pretty loudly for\r\nthe fact that he is living there without a valid visa, at least without\r\na valid visa in his passport, with the knowledge and consent of the\r\nSoviet authorities. It could hardly be otherwise.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Dulles, we have a quorum call over on the\r\nfloor of the House. I will have to leave. Will you take over as\r\nChairman? I will be back shortly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Very gladly. I have one or two questions.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there any question as to whether a minor can renounce\r\nhis nationality?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. To my knowledge, there is not. To my knowledge----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I will withdraw that question and ask Mr. Chayes that when\r\nit comes, because that probably is a matter for him rather than for you.\r\n\r\nDoes the Embassy in Moscow have any facility for learning about or\r\nfinding out about errant American citizens, or any American citizens\r\nthat are wandering around Russia? Do they register at the Embassy?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They may.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is not a requirement?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; as a matter of fact, most do. Most that are in Moscow\r\ndo stop in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is a book in the Embassy that they can come in and\r\nsign?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oswald did not sign in the book, I gather.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't think he would; no. There would be no need for him\r\nto. He came into the Embassy and spoke to an officer, which is a higher\r\nform of registration in a sense.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For the record, how long was it after his arrival in Moscow\r\nthat he reported to the Embassy?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. He arrived on October 16, and he didn't go into the\r\nEmbassy until October 31.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was about the time his visa--his permission to stay\r\nwas going to expire?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. His permission to stay as designated on his visa had\r\nalready expired.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that a 12-day?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. He was in the Soviet Union 15 days before he went to the\r\nAmerican Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How long was his permit good for?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. His permit was good for 6 days.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES, Only 6 days? You, of course, get no word from the Soviet\r\nUnion when they give visas to Americans to come into the country.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, no, no; we get no cooperation from the Soviet\r\nauthorities on anything concerning American citizens--excepting in\r\ncircumstances where they desire the Embassy's help. A citizen gets sick\r\nwhile he is traveling in the Soviet Union, and they want the Embassy\r\nassistance in some way or other. But even in such cases, surprisingly\r\noften, we do not hear from the Soviet authorities. We hear from the\r\ntraveler himself, somehow, but not from the authorities.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Am I correct in my understanding that the State Department,\r\nhaving issued a valid passport for travel abroad, had no way of knowing\r\nwhether the owner of that passport is going to the Soviet Union or not?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Well, no.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They have no way of knowing? So they have no way of\r\ninforming you about it?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think there is a misunderstanding by a great many\r\nAmerican people that there are certain countries that are named on the\r\npassport, which at one time I think was the case, but no longer is. As\r\nI recall it now an American passport was only stamped \"Not good for\r\nHungary,\" as I believe Oswald's passport was stamped. That has been\r\nchanged, has it not.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. These stamps are changed a little from time to time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I will ask Mr. Chayes that question.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Hungary, North Korea, North Vietnam, and China----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now Cuba.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I see that passport for a moment? I think at this\r\nparticular time this passport was issued, I thought the only stamp was\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think there must have been others, and Hungary was added\r\nafter 1946.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I will just read this.\r\n\r\n\"This passport is not valid for travel to the following areas under\r\nthe control of authorities with which the United States does not have\r\ndiplomatic relations: Albania, Bulgaria, and those portions of China,\r\nKorea, and Vietnam under Communist control.\"\r\n\r\nNow, that speaks as of--this is a printed notice in the passport,\r\nand that speaks as of the date of issue of the passport, September\r\n10, 1959. And then there is a stamp--I guess that is printed on the\r\npassport--also printed, in a special box, \"This passport is not valid\r\nfor travel in Hungary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. And then that is superimposed with a void stamp when we\r\ntook Hungary off the list of restricted areas.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Right. I don't know whether that void stamp was put on in\r\n1959--but it is not important as far as we are concerned.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this passport, as I understand, is perfectly good to\r\ntravel to Russia without any notification to the State Department, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I should state for the record, sir, actually the\r\napplication which Oswald filed on September 4, 1959, included Russia as\r\na place where he intended to visit.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. On the other hand, the State Department has no mechanism\r\nfor notifying posts abroad of ordinary travel to those countries.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if it would not be a convenience to you if in\r\nthe case, let's say, of the Soviet Union, or possibly other Communist\r\ncountries, just as a routine matter they took off this note from the\r\npassport so you would have some record there if anything turned up that\r\nthis fellow had said he was going to Russia. Maybe that would involve\r\nadministrative work.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I can't see what value this would be to a consul.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, if a fellow got into trouble you would turn to his\r\nrecords alphabetically and you would find Lee Harvey Oswald in his\r\napplication said he was going to go to Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. You mean if he gets in trouble in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. If he gets in trouble in Russia, we know he is there.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You might; you might not. They don't always tell you. You\r\ndon't think that would be of any particular value, though?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; I don't, Mr. Dulles. Under any circumstances under\r\nwhich it was useful to the Embassy to know whether a person had said he\r\nwas coming there, we can have the information by cable within 24 hours.\r\nSo to attempt--it would seem to me--to attempt to notify embassies\r\nabroad----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am not saying embassies abroad. I am saying the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. But why the Soviet Union and not Poland, Czechoslovakia,\r\nBulgaria?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I said the Communist countries, I think, before. I\r\ncertainly would not do it for Britain, France, and friendly countries.\r\nThere is no point.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. This would involve a clerical job of major magnitude which\r\nfrom the Embassy's point of view I don't see that it would serve any\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, if a young man 20 years old just out of the Marines\r\nsays he is going to the Soviet Union, isn't that of some significance?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Not necessarily. I mean in terms of the thousands of\r\npeople--thousands of Americans who flutter back and forth across the\r\nface of the earth----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am not talking about people floating back and forth\r\nacross the earth. I am talking about people going to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. In other words, if I had looked at Oswald's application\r\nat the time he made it, knowing nothing else about it than he had\r\njust gotten out of the Marines, I would not think it was so terribly\r\nunusual, or of great interest to me that this young boy is taking a\r\ntrip to a number of western European countries, including the Soviet\r\nUnion. Nor would there be anything in such knowledge which would in any\r\nway I think trigger any action on my part.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you have any special instructions other than the ones\r\nthat you have referred to about the handling of those that renounce\r\ntheir citizenship, or have you covered that, do you think, quite\r\nfully? Are there any special instructions that the Embassy in Moscow\r\nprescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There are none?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No; there are none; no, sir. This sort of thing is down to\r\nthe meat of the consular officer's job. That is, he is out on his own\r\npretty much on something of this sort. He has got to use his judgment,\r\nand such experience as he has, and such commonsense as he has.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He has got to know the law, too--he has to know the law and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. Oh, yes; if you don't know, the first thing you do is look\r\nup the regulation and the law and see what your basic requirement is.\r\n\r\nIn renunciation cases, it is a fairly simple matter--that is, for the\r\nconsular officer, as far as the law is concerned. He doesn't have a\r\nlarge body of law. He has a specific law which tells him exactly what\r\nthe conditions are for renouncing citizenship, and that is it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I differ from you a little bit, in the sense that I don't\r\nthink if a young fellow 20 years old came in to me and wanted to\r\nrenounce his citizenship, and if I were doing consular work, as I was\r\nat one time--I think I would feel that that was a pretty--rather a\r\ntough one to handle.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't say it is not tough to handle. What I meant to say\r\nwas that the legal basis under which the consul, or within which the\r\nconsul has to operate----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I will talk to Mr. Chayes about the problem of a minor\r\ndoing that.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. From the consular's point of view it is a fairly simple\r\none. It doesn't require a lot of legal research.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Just to have that in the record at this point the statute\r\nprovides very clearly on the age problem, section 351(b) of the act\r\nprovides that below 18 years the act specified--the citizen shall not\r\nbe deemed to have expatriated himself by the commission prior to his\r\n18th birthday of any of the acts specified in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\nand 6.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That includes renunciation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, 6 is renunciation. But he has to assert--within 6\r\nmonths after obtaining the age of 18 years--he has to assert his claim\r\nto U.S. nationality, in order to get this automatically. But I would\r\nthink the courts would go further and hold that, especially where\r\nvolunteerism is involved, as in renunciation, below 18 years is the\r\ncutoff point--not 21. It used to be 21, but the Congress reduced the\r\nage limit to 18.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, that covers the point here. Was there anything about\r\nthe Oswald case in the Soviet press at any time to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. To my knowledge, there was not, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the Soviet authorities have given you no information\r\nabout Oswald that hasn't been communicated to us? You have no other\r\ninformation at all from the Soviet authorities about Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No, sir; I never communicated with the Soviet authorities\r\nabout Oswald in any form, nor did they ever ask me anything about him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you don't know any of the other circumstances under\r\nwhich his case was reconsidered after his attempted cutting of his\r\nwrists and suicide? You don't know what channels that went through in\r\nthe Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I was not aware of this element of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were not aware, of course, at that time of this element\r\nof the case. Do you know what intourist guides were in charge of him?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know any other case during the period when you were\r\nin Moscow of an American who had married a Soviet wife and was given\r\nan exist visa as quickly and as easily as Oswald and Marina were given\r\ntheirs?\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I don't know offhand whether Marina Oswald got her visa,\r\nher exit visa, that quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, I think that is a matter of record--when she applied\r\nand when she got it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The American visa----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is the Soviet exit visa.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You are talking about the Soviet passport? She applied for\r\nher passport----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is a visa to get out.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. It is both. She needs a Soviet passport. They are issued at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. She applied for her Soviet passport in July 1961, and she\r\nwas informed that it would be issued to her approximately on December\r\n25, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. About 6 months. Do you know of any case where that has been\r\naccomplished in 6 months, other than this case, during your period\r\nthere? I don't think I ought to ask you about any period other than\r\nthe period you were in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I think that a review perhaps of a few other of the cases\r\nof American citizens marrying Soviet girls during the time I was there\r\nmight show that 6 months is not a terribly short period. There isn't,\r\nagain, any standard for things like this. In the first place, so much\r\ndepends upon the local officials in the beginning of the thing, and\r\nwhether they drag their feet or don't, and how much pressure they put\r\non the girl to talk her out of it, and all of this sort of business.\r\n\r\nMy offhand feeling is that 6 months is not an unusually short period of\r\ntime, but it certainly is getting down to about probably the minimum of\r\nour experience with such things.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Witness.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to offer for the\r\nrecord Commission Exhibits 908 through 940 except for Exhibit 911,\r\nwhich we didn't identify.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Let me take these one at a time.\r\n\r\nExhibits Nos. 908 through 940, except for Exhibit No. 911, shall be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 908-910, and 912-940 were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Now, for the record, what about these two numbers that are\r\nomitted?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When Mr. McVickar testifies he will be able to identify\r\nthe documents.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You will have these admitted at a later date?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Now, the second category you wanted to have admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to also offer into evidence Commission\r\nExhibit 946 which is the Oswald passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred, to heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 946 for identification, was admitted into evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I offer for the record Commission Exhibit No. 947 which\r\nis the second copy of the passport renewal application, which has been\r\nidentified after lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And Exhibit No. 947, the passport application, shall be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 947 for identification, was admitted into evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have no further questions, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We are just starting with a new witness. Won't you go ahead.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I want to thank you very much, Mr. Snyder. It has been very\r\nhelpful to us.\r\n\r\nMr. SNYDER. I hope it has.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOHN A. McVICKAR\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. John A. McVickar, who is presently principal officer,\r\nAmerican Consulate in Cochabamba, Bolivia, was consul in the American\r\nEmbassy in Moscow in 1959, until at least the middle of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. McVickar will be asked to testify concerning Oswald's appearance\r\nat the Embassy in October 1959, when Oswald announced his intention to\r\nrenounce his American citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. McVickar will also be asked to testify concerning his interview\r\nof Marina Oswald when she applied for a visa in July of 1961, and his\r\nactions in connection with securing a waiver of section 243(g) of the\r\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952, with respect to Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. McVickar will also be examined on two memoranda which he has\r\nprovided the State Department since the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nAt this time I would ask the Chairman to swear Mr. McVickar.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. McVickar, will you stand. Do you solemnly\r\nswear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I do, so help me God.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. McVickar, will you state your full name for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. John Anthony McVickar.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is spelled M-c-V-i-c-k-a-r?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I have given the court reporter here my card.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And what is your present address?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. American consulate, Cochabamba, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What was your position with the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nin the fall of 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I was one of two officers in the consular section of the\r\nEmbassy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How long did you remain in Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I was there from June of 1959, until September of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it you have been shown a copy of the Congressional\r\nresolution with respect to the formation of this Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I am not sure but I think so. With respect to this\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Do you want me to read it now?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No, just generally have it available.\r\n\r\nDirecting your attention to the fall of 1959, did you have occasion to\r\nsee or to talk to Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I had occasion to see him and to talk briefly to him. I\r\nwas present in the office at the time he was interviewed by Mr. Snyder.\r\nWe had an office about the size of this room with two desks in it, and\r\nMr. Snyder's desk was at one end and mine was at the other, and we did\r\nour business in effect in the same room separately, but this was an\r\nunusual case, and I recall the man coming in and I recall parts of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was the day he came in October 31, 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I couldn't say exactly but that sounds just about right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was it a Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall what time of the day it was?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I don't know. It might have been in the morning but I am\r\nnot sure. I don't know for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did Oswald speak to you at all or was all of his\r\nconversation with Mr. Snyder?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I think all of his conversation, subsequent conversation,\r\nwas with Mr. Snyder. As I recall, he said a few words to those of us\r\nwho were in the office, myself and the secretary, on his way out of the\r\noffice probably, but I don't really remember very much about that, if\r\nhe said anything at all.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you tell the Commission to the best of your\r\nrecollection what he said to Mr. Snyder that you overheard during the\r\nconversation of October 31, 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. In an effort to be helpful I have already, in the form of\r\nthis memorandum, put everything I could remember down.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, are you referring to the memorandum you prepared on\r\nNovember 27, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; the two memoranda, the one of November 27, 1963,\r\nand of April 7, 1964, but, of course, I will try to recall again. As\r\nI recall, he came into the office, and in a rather truculent fashion\r\ngave Mr. Snyder his passport and said that he wanted to renounce his\r\nAmerican citizenship, and he was unusually nasty about it, and he\r\nthen--Mr. Snyder talked with him for about I would say maybe an hour,\r\nin an effort to draw him out I think. The reasons that he gave were\r\nthat he was very angry at the United States and that he was no longer\r\nunder the illusion that we had a good system in the United States. He\r\nhad seen capitalism and imperialism in operation, and I think that he\r\nreferred to his tour in the Marine Corps, and I think to--possibly he\r\nwas stationed in Okinawa.\r\n\r\nI think that he did seem to know something about the renunciation\r\nprocess, and it was almost as though he was trying to bait the consul\r\ninto taking an adverse action against him.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned that he knew certain classified things in connection with\r\nhaving been I think a radar operator in the Marine Corps, and that he\r\nwas going to turn this information over to the Soviet authorities. And,\r\nof course, we didn't know how much he knew or anything like that, but\r\nthis obviously provoked a rather negative reaction among us Americans\r\nin the consulate section. I don't think I probably can recall anything\r\nmore than that for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I take it at the time that Mr. Oswald was in the\r\nEmbassy in 1959 that you did not prepare a memorandum at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; because it was not my responsibility. I did prepare a\r\nmemorandum which I have a copy of here, some time later with respect to\r\na conversation I had with the correspondent, Priscilla Johnson, who had\r\nbeen at that time, as of November 17, 1959, in contact with Oswald, and\r\nI think she sought my guidance as to how she should handle her contacts\r\nwith him, and also I think to inform the Embassy through me as to these\r\ncontacts that she had had.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it the memorandum you refer to is dated November\r\n17, 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We have marked it Commission Exhibit No. 911. I will ask\r\nyou whether that is a copy of the memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is a copy of the memorandum. Is it 911 or\r\n9--excuse me--I would like to call attention to the fact that it seems\r\nto me there is an error in the date there in the second paragraph of\r\nthat memorandum. It says \"She told me that on Sunday May 15.\"\r\n\r\nI am almost certain that would have been Sunday, November 15.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, in that memorandum on the second page you have a\r\nP.S., and you state that Priscilla J. told you that Oswald has been\r\ntold he will be leaving the hotel at the end of this week.\r\n\r\nDid Miss Johnson tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I feel sure I wouldn't have written that if she hadn't.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know whether Oswald actually left the hotel the end\r\nof the week?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I am not sure of the time that he left the hotel, but\r\nfrom what I gather from the record, that must have been about the time\r\nthat he did leave the hotel and go to Minsk. As reflected in the other\r\nmemorandum it was rather unclear exactly how long Oswald spent in\r\nMoscow, but I think that the record is approximately accurate here, and\r\nthat this would have been about the time he would have left the hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. According to other information which the Commission has,\r\nwhich happens to be Oswald's diary so we don't know how accurate it is,\r\nit is stated that he didn't leave Moscow until January 4, 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That is new to me.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You had no such information?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I had no such--this is the first time I heard that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He left the hotel, however, for a period, did he not? He\r\nwas in the hospital for a period.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No, sir; he was in the hospital before he came into the\r\nEmbassy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. His suicide attempt was before October 31.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Now it says leaving the hotel, but it doesn't say--and I\r\nthink that would be all the information that would have been available\r\nat the time that I wrote that, I think the implication was that he was\r\ngoing to leave town as well, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he\r\nwouldn't have spent the ensuing weeks in some other place in the city\r\nof Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In the P.S. you also indicated that \"he will be trained in\r\nelectronics.\" Did you get that information from Miss Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, yes; I think so, according to this.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did she say any more than just he would be trained in\r\nelectronics? Did she say what type of training he would get?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I am afraid I have no more memory than what is written\r\nhere. In fact, I didn't even remember that I had written this\r\nmemorandum until I saw it the other day.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is the language \"he will be trained\" or \"he had been\r\ntrained\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. \"He will be,\" that is what I wrote.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it possible that could have been a reference to past\r\ntraining during the Marines when he was trained in electronics?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I suspect, that what I meant was, that he would be\r\ntrained in electronics by the Soviets, but I think that this was a\r\nrather sketchy note of the conversation, and I suspect that what she\r\nwould have said, was that he would be trained in or used in the field\r\nof electronics, in such a way probably that they would get the greatest\r\nbenefit from his knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, immediately prior to the time that you had the\r\nconversation with Miss Johnson, you had had occasion, hadn't you, on\r\nNovember 9, 1959, to attempt to deliver a message from Oswald's half\r\nbrother to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; there is a note in the file to that effect, and I\r\ndon't really remember that incident very well, just very vaguely. I\r\nthink that I was given the assignment to attempt to deliver a message.\r\nI think the idea was that we would try to see what we could do to get\r\nthis fellow to change his mind and go back to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe attitude that we took toward him was, I think, a normal one, as one\r\nmight toward a very mixed up young person, probably misinformed, and so\r\nI think this was an effort to put him back in communication with his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to show you a note from the Oswald file dated\r\nNovember 9, 1959, which has been given Commission Exhibit No. 942, and\r\na copy of a telegram to Oswald from John E. Pic, which has been given\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 943, and ask you, is that the telegram you\r\nattempted to deliver, and is that the note you wrote at the time when\r\nyou were unable to deliver the telegram to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is the note, and I don't necessarily recollect\r\nthis telegram. It may be that it was in a sealed envelope. I cannot say\r\nthat I recollect the telegram, but it certainly looks like the probable\r\ntelegram that would have been delivered, that I would have attempted to\r\ndeliver at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it that after October 31 of 1959, until Oswald left\r\nMoscow, that you had no further contact with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That is my recollection, yes, that I had no further\r\ncontact with Oswald. I must say that a great many things did take place\r\nin that 2 years.\r\n\r\nI, for example, did not recollect, until just the other day when I\r\nsaw the file, that I had interviewed his wife. But to the best of my\r\nrecollection I never laid eyes on Oswald again.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I think earlier in your testimony you said that you had\r\nprepared a memorandum on November 27, 1963, in which you attempted to\r\nrecall what happened when you were in the American Embassy in 1959,\r\n1960, and 1961, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. A copy of the memorandum has been marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 941. I want to ask you whether that is a copy of the\r\nmemorandum which you prepared, and sent to Mr. Thomas Ehrlich?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is a copy of it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now in that memorandum, on the last page, page 3, the\r\nsecond paragraph, you say: \"In short, it seemed to me that there was a\r\npossibility that he had been in contact with others before or during\r\nhis Marine Corps tour who had guided him and encouraged him in his\r\nactions.\"\r\n\r\nCould you indicate to the Commission the basis for making that\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, I think it is clear here, and if it isn't I should\r\ncertainly say, that this last page is in the nature of speculation and\r\nan attempt to be helpful.\r\n\r\nNow in answer to your question, he gave me the impression, and this was\r\nsupported by the impressions other people seemed to have at the time\r\nthrough conversation, that he was a very young person to have so many\r\nideas in his head, and to have done so much about them, in effect, in\r\nsuch a relatively short time, and so it occurred to some of us that it\r\nmay be that he had had some coaching from somebody; but also, I must\r\nsay, he was an unusual person and apparently sort of an ingrown person,\r\nand so it may be that he had conceived and carried out all these things\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nBut I think that that paragraph in a way sums up that same idea, that\r\nit seemed that there was a possibility that he had had some guidance in\r\ncarrying out this line of action.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Does that also explain the sentence in the same paragraph\r\nwhere you say: \"On the other hand, there also seemed to me to be the\r\npossibility that he was following a pattern of behavior in which he had\r\nbeen tutored by person or persons unknown\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; the same applies.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You had no independent evidence of this at all, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I was asked to explain this attitude I had as best I\r\ncould, and I wrote another memorandum dated April 7, 1964, in which I\r\ndescribed to go into this line of thought.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 958 a\r\nthree-page memorandum from Mr. McVickar to Mr. Ehrlich, dated April 7,\r\n1964?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 958 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that the memorandum you just referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is the same memorandum.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say this memorandum, Commission Exhibit No. 958, was\r\nwritten in April 7, 1964, after you had been asked to explain your\r\nearlier statement concerning following a pattern of behavior in which\r\nhe had been tutored by person or persons unknown?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is correct. I believe that the Commission asked\r\nfor this clarification from the Department of State, and it was relayed\r\nout to me in Bolivia.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In that memorandum you first indicated that you felt that\r\nOswald probably would not know that Helsinki would be a good place to\r\ngo to try to get a visa into Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I think so. It is a well enough known fact among\r\npeople who are working in the Soviet Union and undoubtedly people who\r\nare associated with Soviet matters.\r\n\r\nBut I would say that it was not a commonly known fact among the\r\nordinary run of people in the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You also placed some reliance upon the fact that he didn't\r\ncome in under a $30 per day individual tour or he didn't join a group,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, now, when you say that he did not do these things,\r\nI don't know that he did not do these things. I was merely discussing\r\nthe fact that the particular type of visa that he obtained might have\r\nsome significance, and I went into a little bit maybe not in complete\r\ndetail and maybe not knowing all of the factors, but I tried to go into\r\na little bit of the different kinds of possibilities there might have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, if it is established that Oswald got a tourist\r\nvisa, then I take it that paragraph 2 of your memorandum pretty much\r\ndisappears because the assumption is that he didn't get a tourist visa,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I don't think entirely so. I think you would have\r\nto take a look at the amount of time that it would take him to get a\r\ntourist visa or any kind of a visa.\r\n\r\nBut as I say, I can't be sure that it would be very significant. But I\r\nthink it is a point, however.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How long is the ordinary tourist visa good for?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Tourist visas are usually issued for specific periods of\r\ntime, specific tours. That might be a week or might be a month, and\r\nthey vary in price with the length of time and where they are going,\r\nand also how many people are in the group. If you are going by yourself\r\nit is very expensive. If you are going with larger and larger groups it\r\nbecomes less expensive.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You also indicated in the memorandum in paragraph No. 4\r\nthat according to your experience Oswald's application to remain in the\r\nSoviet Union was relatively quickly accepted by the Soviet authorities?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I think item 4 is more or less canceled out by the fact\r\nthat my memory was inaccurate as to how long he had stayed in Moscow. I\r\nthink that my paragraph 4 is based on my inaccurate memory that he was\r\nthere for only about a week, but if he was there for much longer than\r\nthat, I think that is vitiated.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Assuming that he did stay the longer length of time then,\r\nI take it you don't think there is any particular significance in the\r\nfact that he was able to remain in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I think that the length of time that he apparently\r\nwas in Moscow was sufficient for them to make any bureaucratic decision.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And in paragraph No. 5 you indicated that he seemed to\r\nbe surprisingly competent and determined about what he was doing,\r\nconsidering his age and experience.\r\n\r\nCould you indicate for the Commission just what he did which led you to\r\nthat conclusion?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, that goes back to my comment of a few minutes ago.\r\nI think his bearing and attitude was unusually confident in a very\r\nfar away country where the way of doing things is very different from\r\nwhat it is in the United States, and considering presumably he hadn't\r\ntraveled very much before, and he was very young. I think the word\r\n\"competent\" refers to what seems to be a rather efficiently organized\r\nchain of events which began, as I understand it, when he first applied\r\nfor a passport in the United States in Los Angeles, on September 4,\r\nuntil his apparent appearance in Moscow about October 16, where he\r\napplied for Soviet citizenship. And it seems to me, just offhand I\r\nwould say, that is a fairly well organized movement considering also\r\nthat apparently he went by ship from New Orleans to Helsinki--that\r\nis what I understand--and was determined, as was very evident in\r\neverything he said when he was in the office, was determined to do what\r\nhe was doing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In paragraph No. 8 of the memorandum you place some\r\nsignificance in the fact that he was permitted to belong to a rifle\r\nclub and practice target shooting while in Minsk.\r\n\r\nFirst, from where did you get that information?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I apologize for that in a way. That is complete\r\nspeculation, and the rifle club was something I read about in the\r\nnewspaper. I cannot be very accurate about the rifle club business, and\r\nI point out in that note that it is not related to my contact with him.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you think it would be unusual from your knowledge of\r\nlife in the Soviet Union that people would belong to a rifle club and\r\nthat they could practice target shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I would say so; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, if it was a fact?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. If it was a fact.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That he belonged to a rifle club and did shooting\r\nit would be unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. It would seem to me, yes, particularly for a foreigner,\r\nbut unusual in any case, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But you did not hear that either from Oswald or from his\r\nwife whom you saw later, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I did not. It is unrelated to anything except what\r\nI heard about the case, and I don't know really about this. I just\r\nremember reading about it in the paper, that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After November 17, 1959, you had no more contact with\r\nOswald until some time in July 1961, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is right, and I believe that I didn't have any\r\ncontact with him in July of 1961. I believe I only had contact with his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you speak Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; or I did.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When did his wife come in in July of 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, as I recall, and as I say, my memory here was\r\ncompletely refreshed by the record, and I see that I have some notes in\r\nthe file that are undated, but that they were used evidently to write a\r\ncommunication to the Department of State which was dated on August 28,\r\n1961, and so I am confident that this interview must have taken place\r\nin say the week before that.\r\n\r\nI departed from the Soviet Union about the 1st of September, and things\r\nwere pretty busy, and I can't remember very much more about it than I\r\ncan see here in the record.\r\n\r\nI do not really remember this interview, and I can only speak about it\r\non the basis of the record.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Isn't it possible that you saw her on July 11, 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; because I think what happened, and I think this is\r\nreflected in the record. I think what happened was that Oswald himself\r\ncame into Moscow and was interviewed by Mr. Snyder on July 10, and that\r\nhe did not have his wife with him, and that he said that he was going\r\nto try to get his wife to come to Moscow in the next few days, so that\r\nshe could be interviewed in connection with the visa, but that in fact\r\nshe did not appear until several weeks later, some time in August.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Are you certain about this, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. This is the best of my recollection, and I am pretty sure\r\nthat I read something in the record yesterday that indicates that she\r\nwas not in Moscow at the time he was interviewed by Mr. Snyder in July\r\nof 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Wasn't it possible that Mr. Snyder talked to Mr. Oswald\r\non July 8, which was a Saturday, and that Mrs. Oswald appeared at the\r\nEmbassy with Oswald on July the 10th, or on July 11th, 2 or 3 days\r\nlater?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I won't say that it is not possible, and as I say,\r\nI don't remember this. But I very much doubt that I would have\r\ninterviewed somebody in the middle of July and have not written to\r\nthe State Department about it until the end of August, and I say that\r\nhonestly. That was not the way we operated.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You referred to some handwritten notes you saw in the\r\nfile. I would like to show you Commission Exhibit No. 945 and ask you\r\nwhether that is the copy of the notes that you were referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That is the copy of them. I do not believe they are\r\ndated, and it was with a ballpoint pen. I made this copy for myself\r\nfrom the copy that is in the file.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Would it be appropriate to point out that there seems to be\r\nmore on your copy than on his copy?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No, these are my own notes. This is exactly what it is\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I take it that Commission Exhibit No. 945 is some\r\nnotes you took at a time when you had an interview with Marina Oswald,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now you have a notation \"was not Komsomol.\" What does that\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That I am confident means that I asked her whether\r\nshe was a member of the Komsomol, which is the Communist youth\r\norganization, and this would have been an ordinary question for me to\r\nask a visa applicant because this had some bearing on her admissibility\r\nto the United States under the immigration law, and I was apparently\r\nsatisfied from what she said she was not. There is no other way of\r\nreally establishing it under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she say whether she had at anytime been a member of the\r\nKomsomol?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I would have undoubtedly phrased my question in such a\r\nway as to cover that point, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you ask her whether she was a member of any particular\r\nCommunist organization?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; and I believe that, as I stated in this report to\r\nthe Department of State, and I think it appears a little bit in here,\r\nthat she was a member of a Profcoes, which is probably a combination of\r\nEnglish and Russian, but this would have been a labor union, and she\r\napparently was a member of the medical workers labor union when she was\r\nin the technical school, and then later in her work since 1957, it says\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When you had this interview wouldn't she then have to\r\nfill out or you would have to fill out a form or some type of petition\r\nto get her classified as an alien eligible for an immigration visa?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. This was not the procedure. There is a form of\r\napplication for a visa, the number of which I forget. But that, under\r\nthe procedure, was filled out by the applicant at a later date.\r\nThis initial interview was to obtain in effect the approval of the\r\nDepartment of State from the security point of view for the issuance of\r\nthe visa, and the interview was in connection with preparing a report\r\ncovering the points that are of concern to the Department in that\r\nconnection, and this report was prepared by me, sent in on August 28,\r\n1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 959 a copy\r\nof a petition to classify status of alien for issuance of immigrant\r\nvisa, and it shows it was signed by Lee Harvey Oswald, and that\r\nthe beneficiary was Marina N. Oswald, and that it was sworn to and\r\nsubscribed before you on July 11, 1961. I ask you, have you seen that\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, this is something that I did not recall. But I see\r\nthat it was also an enclosure to my document which I sent in on August\r\n28, 1961.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly I must then have taken Mr. Oswald's oath on this document\r\non the date specified. This would not have required the presence of his\r\nwife, but I am sure then on the basis of what I see here that this must\r\nhave occurred, but I did not remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Since you have that document before you, could you then\r\nsay that there is a possibility that Commission Exhibit No. 945 was\r\nwritten on July 10 or July 11, 1961, rather than in August as you\r\nearlier testified?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I would say there is a possibility, but again I doubt it\r\nbecause for one thing I do recall this item in the record which said\r\nthat she was not present when he came in to the Embassy in July, and I\r\nam confident that there would have been no reason to hold up the type\r\nof report made here unless it was that she wasn't available for an\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nBut as I say, I couldn't say for sure, but I don't remember, I don't\r\nthink of any reason that would have caused a delay of this kind unless\r\nit had been that she didn't come in. I think it is too bad that I\r\ndidn't date this note, but I guess I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Can we infer from Commission Exhibit No. 959 that you must\r\nhave seen Mr. Oswald on July 11, 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I think this would be a safe assumption, but I don't\r\nremember anything about it, and it could have been a very routine thing\r\nyou see, because the way the work was arranged was that Consul Snyder\r\nas the officer in charge handled our matters relating to citizenship,\r\nand I handled matters relating to visas, and this was a visa matter and\r\nhe could very well have asked that I take Mr. Oswald's oath on this\r\npetition in behalf of his wife, and it might have a very pro forma\r\nthing. But I honestly don't remember this incident; but this sort of\r\nthing is never done unless the person is present, unless both signing\r\nparties are present.\r\n\r\nSo it would seem to me that this man must have appeared to me and\r\nsigned this thing and said that it was his legal act, and then I\r\ncertified to that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By both signing parties you only mean Oswald and the notary\r\nor whoever certifies to it?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I being the notary in this case you see. But the\r\nbeneficiary, Mrs. Oswald, did not have to be present for this thing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. There is a possibility she was present?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, I think it is possible; but I rather doubt it\r\nfrankly, and I doubt it on the basis of what I have said before, that I\r\nthink I recall seeing in the record that she was not present, and that\r\nI don't see why this whole procedure would't have gone through much\r\nmore quickly if she had been, that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You keep on referring to the fact that you recall seeing\r\nthis in the record. Could you tell me where you saw it, please?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, I can try to find it. I think the best thing would\r\nbe if I looked at the Moscow official file. Is that right here? Okay;\r\nwell, maybe I can find it. Is that all right if I take a minute to look\r\nthrough these papers?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ABRAM CHAYES\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chayes, will you take the following oath. Do\r\nyou swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The Honorable Abram Chayes is the Legal Adviser to\r\nthe Department of State. Mr. Chayes will be asked to testify with\r\nrespect to the files and other information and documents supplied the\r\nCommission by the Department of State dealing with Mr. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. Chayes will also be asked about the legal correctness of certain\r\ndecisions made by various offices of the State Department with regard\r\nto Oswald, including whether Oswald had lost his American citizenship\r\nby his actions in 1959, whether his passport should have been returned\r\nto him in July 1961, whether his passport should have been renewed\r\nbased upon the July 10, 1961, application, whether he should have been\r\nissued his 1963 passport, and whether action should have been taken to\r\nrevoke it in October 1963 as a result of information received by the\r\nPassport Office, and whether the Department and the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service acted properly in connection with section 243(g)\r\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to Marina. Mr.\r\nChayes will also be asked about the lookout card system in the Passport\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, will you state for the record your full name?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. My name is Abram Chayes. There is a middle name that I\r\ndon't use. It is Joseph.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Where do you presently reside?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. At 3520 Edmunds Street NW., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When did you become Legal Adviser to the State Department?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think I was sworn in on February 7, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. So, therefore, anything that happened with respect to Mr.\r\nOswald prior to that time you had nothing to do with and knew nothing\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I should say that I never heard the name Lee Harvey\r\nOswald until November 22, 1963, so that neither before nor after the\r\ntime I became Legal Adviser, before the assassination, did I have any\r\ndirect knowledge about Oswald, nor do I believe I passed directly on\r\nany matters in the case, although there may have been some matters that\r\nwere considered in my office. I am not sure about that, but I took no\r\npersonal action in the case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Since the assassination your office has had occasion to\r\nreview the various files which were in the State Department dealing\r\nwith Lee Harvey Oswald, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; on November 22, Mr. Ball, the Under Secretary of\r\nState, directed me to take in personal charge all the files in the\r\nDepartment that I could find, and to review those files and be prepared\r\nwith a report for the Secretary the following morning on the general\r\nrelations of Mr. Oswald and the State Department.\r\n\r\nI did take some files, the basic files into my custody at that time,\r\nand retained them in my custody, I think, until we sent them to the\r\nCommission at the Commission's request. And others than who were\r\nworking on the matter in the Department had access to the files but had\r\nto work in my office on them.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. On or about May 28, 1964, you had occasion to reassemble\r\nthe files and deliver another set to the Commission, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; from time to time between the first delivery, which\r\nwas probably last December sometime, and just last week we have made\r\nother papers available to the Commission as they have come to our own\r\nnotice. A file search of this kind in a place like the Department of\r\nState is a pretty elaborate business.\r\n\r\nOnly last week we got a whole new shipment from the Moscow Embassy in\r\nwhich they said, \"We have sent you before everything that you didn't\r\nhave duplicates of, but here is a whole bunch of duplicates.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it turned out that some of them weren't duplicates as appeared just\r\nthis morning. We made those available as soon as they came in.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it with the covering letter of May 28, 1964, and\r\nthe description you made of the file together with the other files that\r\nyou delivered to us just yesterday, that they constitute all of the\r\nfiles that the State Department has?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. As I say, they constitute all that we have been able to\r\nfind, all the documents we have been able to find after a most diligent\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nI myself did not personally conduct the search, but we directed\r\nresponsible officers in all the various places where documents might\r\nbe to give us all the documents they had, and I think we made a very\r\nintensive search, and to my knowledge there are no other documents in\r\nthe Department relating to this matter in any way.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Shortly after the Commission was appointed, you had\r\nprepared under your direction, and submitted to the Commission a\r\ndocument entitled \"Report of the Department of State Lee Harvey\r\nOswald,\" is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And this document is an examination of the various actions\r\ntaken by people in the State Department, and your judgment as to the\r\nlegal correctness of the various actions?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, as you see, the document consists of five subparts.\r\nIt is an analysis and summary of the documents in the files. We went\r\nthrough the files, looked at all the documents, tried to summarize them\r\nfor the Commission so as to give the Commission the fullest possible\r\nappreciation of the contacts between Oswald and the Department. Where\r\nit was necessary to elucidate policies or matters of law in order to\r\ngive the Commission that appreciation, we have done so, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The Report has been given a number of Commission Document\r\nNo. 2. (Commission Exhibit No. 950.) After that you, on May 8, 1964,\r\nsent a letter to the general counsel for the Commission in which you\r\nanswered certain questions which had been proposed by the general\r\ncounsel?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; the general counsel sent us a questionnaire with two\r\nattachments, attachment A and attachment B. Attachment A referred to\r\nmatters mostly concerning Russia and the Embassy in Moscow. Attachment\r\nB raised questions about matters within the Department, passport and\r\nvisa offices within the Department. Each attachment contained a series\r\nof questions.\r\n\r\nAgain I think it is more accurate to state that the responses were\r\nprepared under my supervision and direction. I, of course, reviewed\r\nevery response and and none were sent out without my approval. But I\r\nwas not the draftsman or didn't do all of the work.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The first question that the Commission would like to know\r\nabout and be given some advice on is the question of whether the acts\r\nwhich Oswald performed in October 1959, and shortly thereafter, would\r\nin your opinion result in his loss of citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In my judgment they would not amount to expatriating acts.\r\nThe basic analysis is covered in the third part of Commission Document\r\nNo. 2, entitled \"Lee Harvey Oswald--Expatriation.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On what page is that, Mr. Chayes?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I am sorry, each of the parts begin at No. 1, so it\r\nis not very convenient, but it is about halfway through. There is a\r\nmemorandum entitled \"Memorandum Lee Harvey Oswald--Expatriation.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in that memorandum we analyze three sections of the act under\r\nwhich it might be argued that an expatriation took place.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I say in that memorandum we analyzed the three possible\r\nsections of the act under which it might be argued that an expatriation\r\ntook place, and in each case we conclude, and I think properly, that\r\nthere was no expatriation. The first section is section----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask one question? This is a formal opinion of your\r\noffice as Legal Adviser to the State Department?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I take responsibility for this as my present opinion, yes,\r\nsir, and it goes out over my signature. We are not quite like the\r\nAttorney General. We don't have opinions that get bound up in volumes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I realize that it is not a formalized opinion from that\r\nangle. Was this ever submitted to the Department of Justice for\r\nconsideration?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; it was not.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. Actually this report did go to the Department of Justice\r\nbecause it was submitted before the Commission was formed.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; but it wasn't submitted to the Department of Justice\r\nfor consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For concurrence or anything of that kind.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. For concurrence, no.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, the first section which I assume you address your\r\nattention to was section 349(a) (1).\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We could do it that way.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you want to start with 349(a) (6)?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We started with (a) (6) in the memorandum because there was\r\nlikely to be a better case under (a) (6) than almost anything else.\r\nThe reason why one might argue more about (a) (6) than anything else,\r\nis that there were written statements by Oswald saying, \"I renounce my\r\ncitizenship\" or words to that effect, and they were made in writing,\r\nand in a way that appeared to be intended as a formal, considered\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nBut (a) (6) says that a U.S. national may lose his nationality by\r\n\"making a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or\r\nconsular officer of the United States in a foreign state, in such form\r\nas may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\nNow, even if you resolve every other issue in favor of expatriation,\r\nthat is if you say handing a fellow a letter of the kind that Oswald\r\nhanded to Mr. Snyder was a formal renunciation of nationality before\r\na diplomatic or consular officer, it was clearly not on the form\r\nprescribed by the Secretary of State, and the courts have been very\r\nprecise on that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have those citations, Mr. Chayes?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The form we have here, it is called \"Form of Oath of\r\nRenunciation.\" It is volume 8 of the Foreign Affairs Manual of the\r\nDepartment of State, and it is an exhibit to section 225.6, and you can\r\nsee here that it is a fully prescribed form.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you have any case where (a) it was a written statement,\r\nand (b) it was given to a consul and yet because it was not on the form\r\nprescribed by the Secretary of State, a court has held that it was not\r\na renunciation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No case has been decided under 349(a) (6), but the general\r\nline of cases under 349 is to resolve every doubt in favor of the\r\ncitizen, and there are innumerable citations to that effect. I feel\r\nquite confident when the statute itself prescribes that the form should\r\nbe one established by the Secretary, and where the Secretary has in\r\nfact prescribed such a form, that one cannot bring himself under (a)\r\n(6) unless he uses the form.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Wouldn't the two letters that Oswald delivered be\r\nconsidered as making an affirmation or other formal declaration of\r\nallegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, which\r\nis an act under (a) (2)?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That would be (a) (2), and we consider that at page 7 of\r\nthe memorandum, subsection C.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are we through with all pages up to 7?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; we probably go back to 1. But there we do have cases,\r\nand the cases are clear that the oath or affirmation or formal\r\ndeclaration under section (a) (2) has to be to an official entitled to\r\nreceive it on behalf of the foreign state, and even then the courts\r\nhave been very sticky about holding people to that.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is one case where a dual national, a Philippine and\r\nU.S. national, made an oath of allegiance to the Philippines in the\r\nusual form in order to get a Philippine passport, and it was asserted\r\nthat this was an expatriating act, and the court held no, it wasn't. In\r\nre _Bautista's Petition_, 183 F. Supp. 271 (D.C. Guam, 1960). There is\r\na case where a man took an oath of allegiance to the British Crown, but\r\nthe recipient of the oath was his employer, private employer, and it\r\nwas held that that was not the kind of oath that is involved. In _The\r\nMatter of L._ 1 I. & N. Dec. 317 (B.I.A. 1942).\r\n\r\nThe courts have said that this is a reciprocal relationship in which in\r\norder to come under this section, the citizen or the U.S. citizen must\r\noffer his allegiance to the foreign state and the foreign state must\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There has to be action on both sides. Unilateral action is\r\nnot enough if the affirmation is not accepted.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is the way I read the cases. Now, of course, if it\r\ncomes before, if the oath is taken before an official of the foreign\r\nstate that is authorized to take oaths of allegiance, why then nothing\r\nmore is needed than that. But making an oath or statement of allegiance\r\nto another American or to a private party, whatever his nationality,\r\nhas been held not to fall within 349 (a)(2).\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know whether Oswald had to make any statement or\r\ntake any oath when he got employment in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't personally, but it may have been inquired into by\r\nthe consul when Oswald came back for a renewal passport.\r\n\r\nI think the record shows that it was concluded that there was no\r\nevidence that he became a naturalized Soviet citizen, and so far as I\r\nknow, there is no evidence that he in any other way took an oath of\r\nallegiance of the kind that would bring him under 349(a)(2).\r\n\r\nEven if he had had to do so, for example, in connection with his\r\nemployment, there are cases which may say that that is not a voluntary\r\noath if it is done out of economic necessity and it will not,\r\ntherefore, serve to expatriate. See _Insogna_ v. _Dulles_, 116 F. Supp.\r\n473 (D.D.C. 1953); _Stipa_ v. _Dulles_, 233 F. 2d 551 (3d Cir. 1956);\r\nand _Bruni_ v. _Dulles_, 235 F. 2d 855 (D.C. Cir. 1956). In at least\r\none other case, _Mendelsohn_ v. _Dulles_, 207 F. 2d 37 (D.D.C. 1953), a\r\ncourt held that the plaintiff had not expatriated himself by residing\r\nabroad for more than 5 years since he had remained abroad to care for\r\nhis sick wife, who was too ill to travel.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be helpful wherever you say, Mr.\r\nChayes, there are cases, that the record show the citation of the cases.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think most of the cases that I am relying on are cited in\r\nthe memorandum to which I am referring. But there may be others that I\r\nam recollecting. If I could have a chance to review the transcript, I\r\nwill submit exact citations in each case.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think that would be very helpful. Otherwise I\r\nthink the record is----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; I agree.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is not clear or not complete, and as far as I am\r\nconcerned, and I think the Commission would agree, that you should\r\nreview the transcript to supply those citations for those particular\r\ncategories of cases.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I will be very glad to do so, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now do you want to address yourself to section 349(a) (1)?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well (a) (1) is obtaining naturalization, and there just\r\nwasn't any indication, there wasn't any evidence at all that he had\r\nbecome a naturalized Soviet citizen.\r\n\r\nWe knew that he applied for naturalization, but even on the basis of\r\nhis Soviet documents he had not been given Soviet citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it your testimony is that after reviewing all of\r\nthe files, your office has determined that Oswald committed no act\r\nwhich would justify the Department stating that he had expatriated\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think that is right. I more than think that is right. I\r\nknow that is right. We have reached the conclusion, and I personally\r\nhave reached the conclusion, that Oswald's actions in the Soviet Union,\r\nalthough he may very well have wanted to expatriate himself at one time\r\nor another, did not succeed in doing that.\r\n\r\nI think for the record I would like to read here a citation from the\r\ncase of _Stipa_ v. _Dulles_ decided by the Court of Appeals for the\r\nThird Circuit--the citation is at 233 F. 2d. 551--which gives some idea\r\nof the general attitude with which the courts approach expatriation\r\ncases. In that case it said:\r\n\r\n    The burden of proving expatriation generally is upon the defendant\r\n    who affirmatively alleges it [that is the Secretary of State] and\r\n    the burden is a heavy one. Factual doubts are to be resolved in\r\n    favor of citizenship. The burden of proof on the Government in an\r\n    expatriation case is like that in denaturalization. The evidence\r\n    must be clear, unequivocal and convincing. The rule prevailing\r\n    in denaturalization cases that the facts and the law should be\r\n    construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen\r\n    equally applies to expatriation cases. American citizenship is not\r\n    to be lightly taken away.\r\n\r\nThis is the dominating attitude of the courts in all of these cases. We\r\nfind, for example, that a group of Japanese Americans, who during the\r\nwar under the stress of the relocation program, did all of the business\r\nof renouncing their citizenship and did it in the most formal kind of a\r\nway, and it was clear that they had done it and they had meant to do it\r\nand all that sort of thing. When after the war they raised the question\r\nof their citizenship status, the court held well, that the emotional\r\nstress and strain of the relocation and shock under those circumstances\r\nwas such that this shouldn't be held against them. _Acheson_ v.\r\n_Murakami_, 176 F. 2d 953 (9th Cir. 1949).\r\n\r\nSo the courts have gone very, very far to uphold the notion that\r\nAmerican citizenship is not to be lightly taken away, see e.g.,\r\n_Schneiderman_ v. _United States_, 320 U.S. 118 (1943), and that has\r\naffected not only our legal judgment in the particular case, but our\r\ngeneral policy which you have heard explained by Mr. Snyder and Mr.\r\nMcVickar.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you describe for the record what the policy of the\r\nDepartment is when a person appears at a foreign embassy and attempts\r\nto expatriate himself?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Before you answer that question may I ask a question.\r\nIn your memorandum here, relating to the paragraph we have been\r\ndiscussing, there is a footnote that interests me. It says:\r\n\r\n\"After the assassination of President Kennedy, an official of the\r\nSoviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to an officer of the American\r\nEmbassy in Moscow that Soviet authorities had considered Oswald's\r\napplication for Soviet citizenship but had decided not to approve it\r\nbecause Oswald seemed unstable.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Coleman, do we have that in our files?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; I think also the American Embassy officer was\r\nAmbassador Kohler?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It was Stoessel.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, Stoessel, Deputy Chief of Mission.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The statement was made to him by an official of the Foreign\r\nOffice?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think he is identified in the telegram; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Also when the Secretary appears tomorrow I think he will\r\nimpart some information on what the Soviet Ambassador told him as to\r\nthe reason why they refused Oswald citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; I would rather like to put that in the record unless\r\nthere is some similar reason to the one we had before.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Could I go off the record for just a moment?\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\n(Mr. Coleman's last question was read back by the reporter.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I think the basic policy of the Department is a\r\nrecognition that this is a very grave and serious and irrevocable act\r\nthat can affect a person's life and does affect a person's life very\r\nfundamentally. And so the policy of the Department is to make sure that\r\nthe person making the renunciation does so with full recognition of the\r\nconsequences of his action, of the fact that it is a very grave act,\r\nand in such a way as to make sure that it is a completely voluntary act\r\nin every sense of the word, so that it can be shown not only to be free\r\nof any physical duress or coercion, but mental stress and things of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\nThis is not only true because of the recognition of what it means\r\nto the individual, but also because in order to support the\r\ndenaturalization in court. You have got to be able to show those things\r\nunder the standards and the general attitude that I have set forth.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it your testimony is that you reviewed all of the\r\nfiles and looked at all of the memorandums or had it done under your\r\ndirection, and your judgment is that Oswald had not expatriated himself\r\nin 1959?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; on the basis of the record that I have in the file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And with that determination made, then I take it that when\r\nOswald appeared at the Embassy in July 1961, and requested that his\r\npassport be returned to him, that Mr. Snyder had no other alternative\r\nbut to return his passport to him, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In the absence of any other disqualifying ground, and there\r\nwasn't any other disqualifying ground either known to the Embassy in\r\nMoscow or available in our own files back home. If Mr. Oswald was a\r\ncitizen, and was not disqualified in some other way, he was entitled to\r\nthe passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know from studying the records, or otherwise,\r\nwhether when that request was made by Lee Harvey Oswald, it was\r\nreferred back to the State Department and reconsidered again?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, yes; it was. In the first place, the expatriation issue\r\nwasn't decided until that time. That is the expatriation issue was open\r\nuntil he came back in and applied for the passport.\r\n\r\nThe expatriation issue was decided in the first instance by the officer\r\nin the field, and then the tentative decision was reported by him back\r\nto the Passport Office and the expatriation decision was reviewed in\r\nthe Passport Office at that time. The file was reviewed for other\r\npossible disqualifications, and an instruction went out with respect to\r\nthe return of the passport.\r\n\r\nThe field was instructed that when the passport was returned, it should\r\nbe marked for travel to the United States only, and then when the\r\npassport was finally renewed some weeks later, that was also pursuant\r\nto a departmental instruction.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that reviewed in your office at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; it wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Shouldn't it have been?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't think so, Mr. Dulles. The Passport Office has to\r\nmake nationality determinations on thousands and thousands of people.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But this is a legal question, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. But they have adjudicators in the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They have legal officers.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Thirty lawyers or something.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They have?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. And two lawyers reviewed this case. There are just\r\nthousands of nationality or loss of nationality determinations.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And those are generally all settled in the Passport Office?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In almost every case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Some of them may be presented to your office.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Where they present especially difficult questions of law or\r\ngeneral policy of administration; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And this wasn't considered as a case involving particularly\r\ndifficult questions of law?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; I don't think it did then or does now.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the people in Washington who made this review\r\nknow that on this one particular form, I don't recall the Commission\r\nExhibit, that Oswald said, \"I have done this, that,\" one or the other?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. They would have had that before them. I think that is the\r\nform that was sent back to the Department, the one that had \"have\r\nnot\" crossed out and \"have\" was left standing. So they made the\r\ndetermination on the basis of a form----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 938, for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Commission Exhibit No. 938, in which Oswald indicated\r\nthat he had done one of these acts, and then supplied a supplementary\r\nquestionnaire explaining in fuller detail what he meant.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you happen to know who the lawyers were who did this in\r\nthe Passport Office, and whether they would be available if we should\r\nwant to see them?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think they are on the list to testify.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, those lawyers didn't review the file in 1961.\r\nThey are the two lawyers that reviewed it in October 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I see. Well, I can find out if we haven't supplied the\r\nnames already.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I don't think any lawyer reviewed the file in 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, an adjudicator did.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It was Miss Waterman. She is not a lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She is coming before us?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. She is a passport adjudicator.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, were have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 929 an\r\nOperations Memorandum from the Department of State to the Embassy in\r\nMoscow, dated March 28, 1960, which stated that:\r\n\r\n\"An appropriate notice had been placed in the Lookout Card Section\r\nof the Passport Office in the event that Mr. Oswald should apply for\r\ndocumentation at a point outside the Soviet Union.\"\r\n\r\nI would like to show you this Commission exhibit and ask you are you\r\nfamiliar with that memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I have seen this, but only since the assassination in my\r\ngeneral review of the files.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, has your office made a check to determine whether a\r\nlookout card was prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; Mr. Coleman. In connection with the preparation of\r\nthis memorandum, and the responses to the supplemental questions for\r\nthe Commission, we did examine the question of whether a lookout card\r\nwas prepared. I should say again that the matter of preparation of\r\nlookout cards is not under my jurisdiction, and my knowledge of this is\r\nonly from a subsequent investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Your examination revealed that a lookout card actually was\r\nnever prepared, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think we have to say that our examination does not reveal\r\nthat a lookout card was prepared, and that on balance examining all\r\nthe relevant considerations, it appears more likely than not that no\r\nlookout card was prepared.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there was none in the file.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. There was none in the file, but there wouldn't have been\r\nanyway, because this lookout card was ordered prepared because there\r\nwas a doubt as to whether Oswald had expatriated himself. Once that\r\ndoubt had been removed by an adjudication as it was in July of 1961,\r\nthe lookout card based on the possibility of expatriation would have\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth a moment if I could give you some general picture of\r\nthe lookout card system. Miss Knight will be able to testify in much\r\ngreater detail than I as to the actual operating----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that when 1963 came around and there was a further\r\napplication for a passport, there was no lookout card then found in\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Nor should there have been.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the issue under your procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Let me refer back to 1961 when you determined or the\r\nDepartment determined to renew the passport. Now, as I understand it,\r\nthere was a search made of the Lookout Card Section, and the records\r\nthat we have reveal that no lookout card was found.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Even in 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't think that that can be said that categorically. I\r\nthink it appears probable that there was no lookout card in 1961 at\r\nthat time, yes; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But in 1961 all of these facts with regard to Oswald were\r\nbefore you, were they not?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. If I could just give some notion of what this system is\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The lookout card is an IBM card, an ordinary IBM card,\r\nand it should be prepared on anyone as to whom some evidence of\r\ndisqualification for a passport exists in our files. If the system\r\nworked perfectly, anytime there was an unresolved question about the\r\neligibility of a person for a passport----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Does a defector or an attempted defector fall in\r\nthat category?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; the problem here was that this man had attempted to\r\nexpatriate himself, and said he was going to naturalize himself as a\r\nSoviet citizen, and if he had done either of those things effectively,\r\nhe would have disqualified himself for a passport.\r\n\r\nSo there was an unresolved question on the facts known in 1959, or\r\nJanuary 1960, whenever it was. And at that point a lookout card should\r\nhave been prepared for him.\r\n\r\nThen in July of 1961, when he came back in in Moscow, and asked for\r\nthe renewal of his passport, that question of expatriation was then\r\ndetermined, both in Moscow and at home, and it was determined in favor\r\nof the applicant. So that the outstanding question was then removed,\r\nand if the procedures had gone right, the lookout card also, if it had\r\nbeen prepared, would have been taken out of the lookout file and torn\r\nup and thrown away.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Don't you keep records of what you put in and what\r\nyou take out?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, the refusal slip which formed the basis on which this\r\nmemorandum that we are talking about was made. There was a refusal slip\r\nwhich was a direction to the person in the lookout card office to make\r\na lookout card, and also probably whoever made the refusal slip also\r\nsent this memorandum to Moscow saying that a lookout card had been\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the refusal slip, which is retained in the main passport\r\nfile of Oswald, it doesn't have the notations that it would have had or\r\nshould have had if a card had been made. So that on the general basis\r\nof the evidence, we conclude that it is probable that no card was made.\r\nBut you can't say that for sure because even if one had been made, it\r\nwould have been removed when the issue was resolved.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If it is probable one wasn't made, but there is\r\na possibility, remote as it might be, don't you have some means of\r\nrecording when a lookout card is removed?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That notation also does not appear.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So the probability is increased.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That there was no lookout card ever made and put\r\ninto the file.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct, sir. All of this is covered in some detail\r\nin our response, our written response to the questionnaire, and comes\r\nto the same conclusion, and all of these points are enumerated.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. There is a Commission Exhibit No. 948 where Mr. Chayes\r\nunder date of May 8, 1964, addressed himself to these problems.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this that which I have here?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And that is to be in the record?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We will give it an exhibit number.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nI would like to mark as Commission Exhibit No. 948 a letter from the\r\nLegal Adviser to the Department of State to Mr. Rankin dated May 8,\r\n1964.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 948 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to ask the witness whether this letter was\r\nprepared under his direction together with the attachments.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; the letter and attachments are those which were\r\nprepared--I haven't had a chance to examine each right now, but appear\r\nto be those which were prepared in my office and under my personal\r\nsupervision in response to the request of the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In Commission Exhibit No. 948 you explain the lookout card\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You treat with the question of whether a lookout card was\r\nin the State Department file on Oswald in 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir; I think it is covered in the answers to questions\r\n12 and 13. In particular the answer to question 13 shows the\r\nevaluation on which we reached the conclusion that it is probable that\r\na lookout card was not prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was there any other occasion as a result of acts by Oswald\r\nthat you felt that a lookout card should have been prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What were those?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Under the procedures of the Department, once Oswald was\r\ngiven a repatriation loan, as he was on his return to this country in,\r\nwhat was it, May of 1962, a lookout card should have been prepared and\r\nshould have been maintained in the lookout file during the period when\r\nthere was an unpaid balance on his repatriation loan, and in that case\r\nit appears pretty certainly that no card was prepared. We don't even\r\nhave in that case a refusal slip indicating a direction to prepare a\r\ncard.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can you refuse issuance of a passport when there is an\r\nunpaid balance due?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't know what the courts would say, but a person who\r\naccepts a repatriation loan now signs an agreement that he will not\r\napply for a passport until he has paid the loan.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Oswald got his loan, the form was a little different,\r\nbut even then he signed a statement saying that he understood that\r\npassport facilities would not be furnished to him while an outstanding\r\nbalance was----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could we have in the record the form that was in\r\nexistence before and that which is now the form?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think you do have it in the report. Again it is in the\r\nanswer to question 13, page 3 of that answer, if you see there it says,\r\n\"In the promissory note\"--it is about the middle of the page--\"which\r\nhe signed for the loan he stated, section 423.6-5 that 'I further\r\nunderstand and agree that after my repatriation I will not be furnished\r\na passport for travel abroad until my obligation to reimburse the\r\nTreasurer of the United States is liquidated.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You testified that you made a search of the records or you\r\nhad a search made of the records of the Department, and you conclude\r\nthat no lookout card was ever prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; we can't find any evidence that a lookout card might\r\nhave been prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know why one was not prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. There could have been more than one reason. It could have\r\nbeen simply a bureaucratic oversight. It could have been that they\r\ndidn't have date and place of birth information on Oswald.\r\n\r\nBecause of the possibility of identical names, the practice of the\r\nPassport Office is not to prepare a lookout card on any individual on\r\nthe basis of his name alone. They need both name and date and place of\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nNow, it may have been either that the Finance Office failed to notify\r\nthe Passport Office because it did not have date and place of birth\r\ninformation, or that it did notify the Passport Office, and because\r\nthere was no date and place of birth information, the Passport Office\r\ndid not make a card.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But the Passport Office had that information.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The Passport Office had the date and place of birth\r\ninformation on Lee Harvey Oswald; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But not on Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Marina wouldn't have gotten into the Passport Office at\r\nall. She is an alien. But they didn't know whether the Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, or they might not have known that the Lee Harvey Oswald that\r\ncame down from the Finance Office, if indeed it did come down, was the\r\nsame Lee Harvey Oswald as to whom they had date and place of birth\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThat is the problem. The problem is avoiding the difficulties that\r\nwould arise if duplicated names put you into the lookout card system.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Once the loan had been repaid, would the card have been\r\ntaken out?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. So, therefore, by the time he applied for the passport in\r\nJune 1963, the loan had been paid so there wouldn't have been a lookout\r\ncard in any event.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct. The lookout card would have been removed,\r\nhad it been made, on January 29, 1963, 6 months before the passport\r\napplication, when Oswald finally paid the last of his outstanding loan\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can I ask a question there? Is the lookout card then only\r\nprepared in those cases where a passport should be refused irrespective\r\nof the moral turpitude or idiosyncracies or whatever else may be the\r\ncase with regard to the individual?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. There are three cases in which a lookout card is prepared.\r\nOne is the case you have just mentioned, where a passport should be\r\nrefused or there is evidence that might warrant refusal that you have\r\nto look into further.\r\n\r\nThe second is if you are a very important person and your passport is\r\nsupposed to be given specially expeditious treatment.\r\n\r\nAnd the third, if another agency, for example, your old agency or the\r\nFBI or any other agency has asked the Department to inform them in case\r\nof the passport application by a particular individual, a lookout card\r\nwill be made. So those are the three categories.\r\n\r\nNow, the first category is by far the biggest. There are 250,000\r\nlookout cards, and by far the overwhelming majority of those is in the\r\nfirst category, that is people as to whom there is evidence which would\r\nwarrant a determination that they should not be issued a passport.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Does the State Department have any regulations which\r\nset forth the circumstances under which they will refuse a person a\r\npassport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; we have regulations which are set forth, a copy of\r\nwhich is attached to question 17. They appear in volume 22 of the\r\nFederal Register.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Volume 22, title 22?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; title 22, part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it then that in 51.135 you have the regulation\r\nwhich says that you can deny a passport to a member of a Communist\r\norganization, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I think you have to be careful how you read that. It\r\nis a member of a Communist organization registered or required to be\r\nregistered under section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of\r\n1950, as amended.\r\n\r\nThis 51.135 is a regulation which implements section 6 of the\r\nSubversive Activities Control Act, which denies passports to members of\r\norganizations required to register.\r\n\r\nThe only such organization so far against which a final order of\r\nregistration is outstanding, is the Communist Party of the United\r\nStates. So, not only technically but actually, membership in the\r\nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union would not bring you within this\r\nparagraph of the regulation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or the Communist Party of any other country.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Of any other country.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is there any other regulation, which the State Department\r\nhas, dealing with the circumstances under which they can refuse to\r\nissue a passport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The other regulation covering substantive grounds of\r\nrefusal is 51.136.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you read into the record the regulation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; the regulation says:\r\n\r\n\"In order to promote\"----\r\n\r\nWell, it is entitled \"Limitations on Issuance of Passports to Certain\r\nOther Persons.\"\r\n\r\nIt reads:\r\n\r\n\"In order to promote and safeguard the interests of the United States,\r\npassport facilities except for direct and immediate return to the\r\nUnited States shall be refused to a person when it appears to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Secretary of State that the person's activities\r\nabroad would (a) violate the laws of the United States, and (b) be\r\nprejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations, or (c)\r\notherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In 1963, on June 24 when Oswald applied for a passport, he\r\nwas issued the passport within 24 hours after the application; is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is there any record in the Department that anyone ever\r\nexamined Oswald's file to make a determination of whether he should\r\nhave been issued a passport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In 1963 the passport was issued on the basis of a simple\r\ncheck of the lookout file under the normal procedures of the Department.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that when a field office, in this case it was the New\r\nOrleans field office, get a series of passport applications, they\r\nTelex the names of the applicants and their place and date of birth\r\nto the Department, and the Department makes a name check through the\r\nlookout card file. That is all. And if there isn't a lookout card in\r\nthe lookout card file, they authorize the issuance of the passport\r\nby the field agency. The field agency has to make a determination of\r\ncitizenship, of course. But no further action is taken in Washington\r\nunless for some reason or other the field agency would wish to send a\r\nparticular case forward.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Since there was no lookout card, I take it we can assume\r\nthat the June 25, 1963, passport was issued without any----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Without any examination.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Without any consultation of the files on Oswald----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That were in the Department.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I am confident that that was the case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask whether there are any lookout cards to your\r\nknowledge that are filed under that third section there?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. \"Violate the laws or be prejudical\"?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is it; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I don't know for a fact that there are, but if we\r\nwould make such a determination with respect to some person or group, I\r\nsuppose lookout cards would be prepared for such a group.\r\n\r\nAnd I would go further and say that probably the authority, you\r\ndon't need authority to do it, but the theory of preparing cards\r\nfor defectors which we are now doing under the Schwartz to Knight\r\nmemorandum, that we referred to a moment ago, is that it is possible\r\nthat a defector, upon examination of his file, will be shown to fall\r\nwithin one of these categories.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would Oswald now be considered a defector, or should he\r\nhave been at that time if the regulations that you now have in effect\r\nwere then in effect?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. If we had the instruction in the Schwartz to Knight\r\nmemorandum, yes; there would have been a lookout card on Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, assuming on June 25, 1963, a person in the\r\nPassport Office had examined all of the files that the State Department\r\nhad on Oswald from 1959 through June 25, 1963, in your opinion could\r\nthe Department have refused Oswald a passport based upon section 51.136\r\nof the regulation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In my opinion, they could not. They could not have refused\r\na passport based on the information in the Oswald file.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If that is true, how could you have a lookout card\r\nnow that would have resulted, that would result in a passport being\r\nrefused?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't think we could. What the lookout card would do\r\nwould be to refer you to the file. You would look into the file. You\r\nmight then want some further investigation as to this fellow.\r\n\r\nYou might, having seen that you were dealing with this kind of a\r\nperson, want to examine him more fully on his travel plans and so on\r\nand so on. That further investigation might turn up some information\r\nwhich would warrant a determination under one of these subsections. But\r\nif it turned up nothing but what was in the file, you would have to\r\nissue the passport, in my judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is, lookout cards might well be put in in borderline\r\ncases, but when you came to consider the case on all the facts, you\r\nwould decide in favor of issuance of the passport rather than refusal?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; that is the same thing with the expatriation card\r\nwhich should have been made out for Oswald in 1960. It should have\r\nbeen made out because there was a possibility that he had expatriated\r\nhimself. But then when he came to apply for the passport, all the\r\nlookout card would do is say, \"Investigate this carefully and determine\r\nthis issue.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as you say, when you got all the facts as in the expatriation\r\nsituation, you might determine that he had not expatriated himself.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At least in this case if there had been a lookout\r\ncard, there would have been a delay.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is the very least that would have happened.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. There would have been a delay of a couple of days probably.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And in this case time might have been important.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; if you are talking about this case as it actually\r\nhappened, time wasn't important at all. He applied for the passport in\r\nJune of 1963. He got it in June of 1963, and he made no effort to use\r\nthe passport, nor did he have any occasion to use it, until he died.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It would have been a blessing for us if he had used it,\r\nsay, in the sense that the assassination might not have taken place, if\r\nhe had taken the passport and gone to China as he may have contemplated.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, is it your testimony that when the Department\r\nknows a person went abroad in 1959, attempted to defect to the Soviet\r\nUnion, stated that he had information on radar which he was going\r\nto turn over to the Soviet, and the difficulty that we had to get\r\nhim back, it is your opinion that it would not be prejudicial to the\r\ninterests of the United States for him to be given a passport to go\r\nabroad the second time?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I think that is correct without knowing any more\r\nabout what he intended to do this time on his travels abroad.\r\n\r\nYou have got to remember that the discretion that the Secretary can\r\nexercise under 51.136, is as the Supreme Court said in the Kent case, a\r\nlimited discretion, although it is phrased in very broad terms.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have people who are going abroad all the time and\r\nmaking the nastiest kinds of speeches about the United States, or who\r\ngo abroad for political activity that is completely at odds with the\r\npolicy of the United States, and may be even directed against our\r\npolicy. But we could not deny a passport on the grounds of political\r\nactivities, political associations, speech, things of that kind. So\r\nthe Kent case says, as I read it and as most others do. I think you\r\nhave to, in order to apply this section, there are some fairly regular\r\ncategories, fugitives from justice.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one question. If there had been a lookout card in, and\r\nthen you would reconsider the case in June 1963, when he applied, would\r\nyou not then normally have notified the FBI and the CIA that here was a\r\nreturned defector?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was going abroad again?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; not unless the FBI and the CIA had asked us to notify\r\nthem. However, what we might have done would be to use FBI facilities\r\nto make a further investigation of the situation. That is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes informed us prior to the commencement of his\r\ntestimony that he would have to leave at 4 p.m., but would return\r\ntomorrow morning to complete it. He will now be excused. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOHN A. McVICKAR RESUMED\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall, Mr. McVickar, we were trying to determine\r\nwhether Mrs. Oswald came into the Embassy in July or in August 1961,\r\nand you said that if you had an opportunity to look at the State\r\nDepartment file that you might find something which would aid you in\r\nrecollecting.\r\n\r\nHave you had such opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I have. I observe two items in here. There is\r\na despatch prepared by Mr. Snyder which says that Mrs. Oswald was\r\nexpected to come in very shortly. This despatch was prepared I believe\r\non the same day that Mr. Oswald was in the office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that despatch dated July 11, 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The record shows it is Commission Exhibit No. 935.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. And the item is on page 2, and it says, \"He is attempting\r\nto arrange for his wife to join him in Moscow so she can appear at the\r\nEmbassy for a visa interview in the next day or two.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then there is a later despatch dated October 12, 1961, which\r\nencloses the text of certain letters addressed to the Embassy by\r\nOswald, and one of them is a letter dated July 15, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; apparently from Minsk after he had returned.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oh, Minsk.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. And it says that; \"While we were still in Moscow the\r\nforeman at her place of work was notified that she and I went to the\r\nEmbassy for the purpose of visas.\"\r\n\r\nWell now, it seems clear that she did in fact go to the Embassy in\r\nearly July, and that this interview that I had with her undoubtedly\r\ntook place then approximately the 12th or 13th of July.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Wouldn't you say that it took place, sir, on the 11th of\r\nJuly?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. It probably took place then on the 11th of July, except\r\nthat this despatch here, which was dated the 11th, said that she was\r\ncoming in, in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\nNo, no; this says that he appeared at the Embassy on July 8, and so\r\nthis was probably prepared on the 8th of July.\r\n\r\nI would say then it must have taken place on the 11th of July.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is your testimony, therefore, that Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 959, which is the petition to classify status of alien for issuance\r\nof immigrant visa, was prepared on July 11, 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Oh, yes; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That was probably the day that Marina came into the\r\nEmbassy?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Probably the day she came into the Embassy, and probably\r\nthe day on which I interviewed her.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And, therefore, the notes, Commission Exhibit No. 945,\r\nwere apparently made on July 11?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; apparently made then on July 11. They formed the\r\nbasis of this later communication of August 28, and I now think that\r\nthe reason that this was not done sooner, was because it was not an\r\nurgent matter, because they had not yet received exit visas, and we\r\nwere in the process of processing cases that had received exit visas,\r\nand were ready to go, and no one could tell when they might get Soviet\r\nexit visas.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which is the chicken and which is the egg here? I mean, do\r\nyou get your exit visas before you know whether you are going to get\r\ninto the country of destination, or do you get your permission to go to\r\nthe United States before you get your exit visa?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. In an ordinary country you would apply for your American\r\nvisa, and then apply for your exit visa, or permission to depart from\r\nthe country, after you had your American visa.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, in the Soviet Union, it was reversed because it was\r\nso difficult to get exit visas.\r\n\r\nThe American Government never bothered with any of its papers other\r\nthan to just take record of the interest of the people, until after\r\nthey had received permission to depart from the Soviet Union at which\r\npoint we processed their papers expeditiously.\r\n\r\nBut usually there was very little done in the American documentation\r\nuntil after they had received an exit visa from the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, you then on August 28, 1961, prepared the Operations\r\nMemorandum which has been given Commission Exhibit No. 944; is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that was the date of the memorandum.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now in that memorandum you indicated that Marina had been\r\nin to see you; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. The memorandum does not specifically state that. It\r\nmerely gives data necessary to the determination by the Department of\r\nState of the legal status of this individual.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now as the wife of an American citizen, I take it Marina\r\nwould have the right to come into the country under a nonquota status?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What were the sanctions imposed by section 243(g), which\r\nyou referred to in the memorandum?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. There is a provision 243(g), section 243(g) of the\r\nImmigration and Nationality Act, which provides that countries\r\nwhich--and I am just taking this from memory now--which do not accept\r\neither at all or readily, I suppose, deportees from the United States\r\nmay not be granted, the nationals of those countries may not be granted\r\nimmigration visas.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a procedure for waiving these sanctions in\r\nindividual cases, and as I recall the regulations, there was a\r\nprocedure for waiving these sanctions in the cases of relatives of\r\nAmerican citizens, and in the case of Soviet citizens who wanted to go\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\nSo Soviet citizens who were relatives of American citizens could\r\nreceive a waiver of these sanctions.\r\n\r\nIs that clear?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. If the sanctions had not been waived, what would be the\r\neffect of refusing to waive the sanctions?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. If the sanction was not waived, the effect would be a\r\ndenial, in effect, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, of authority to issue the visa.\r\n\r\nThe exact legality of this I am not sure, but I know that we couldn't\r\nissue the immigration visa because she would not be admitted at the\r\nport of entry.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would that mean that Marina could not have come to the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. It would mean that she could not enter the United States,\r\nbut it would not mean that she could not depart from the Soviet Union\r\nif she had a Soviet visa. And, presumably, maybe at some later time\r\nthis----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Couldn't she have gone to say, Brussels, for example, in\r\nBelgium?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. And then applied for a visa there? This may be.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you have any discussions when you were in the Embassy\r\nas to whether if the sanctions imposed by section 243(g) were not\r\nwaived, that you should send her to Brussels and let her get a visa\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I think that the record shows that there were such\r\ndiscussions, but they did not take place during the time I was there.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When did you leave?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I left on September the 1st of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In this memorandum which is Commission Exhibit No. 944,\r\nyou indicated that you thought a favorable advisory opinion and\r\napproval of the petition is recommended, together with a waiver of the\r\nsanctions.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Imposed by section 243(g) of the act, yes. This was a\r\nroutine request which would have been made in any similar case using\r\nalmost exactly that type of language.\r\n\r\nIn short, this was the two actions that we had to receive from\r\nWashington in order to be in a position to issue this visa.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The first action to get the petition granted, that\r\ndepended upon whether she was ineligible, because she belonged to a\r\nCommunist organization, didn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is exactly right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. As to that in your memorandum you indicated that since she\r\nbelonged to the Soviet trade union for medical workers, because she\r\nhad to belong to that to get a job, that you would recommend that the\r\nmembership be considered involuntary.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Under section 212(A)(28)(i) of the act?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is it the general practice to indicate that such\r\nmembership is involuntary when it is connected with employment?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; there are instructions from the Department giving\r\nguidance to officers in general terms, that indicate that membership\r\nin mass organizations, such as a membership in a trade union, in\r\nconnection with one's work, that this membership is ordinarily\r\nconsidered to be involuntary, may be considered involuntary.\r\n\r\nHowever, the instructions are also that all of these cases must be\r\nreferred to Washington with the facts for a determination to be made,\r\nand, of course, it might well be that under some unusual circumstances\r\nif there was some indication of voluntariness, that, you know, such a\r\nmembership would render the person excludable.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now you referred to Department instructions. Are those\r\ninstructions found in the confidential appendix, appendix A to the visa\r\nregulations of the Department in 22 CFR 42.91A28 note 3, last issued on\r\nDecember 9, 1960?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you be kind enough to read into the record the\r\ninstruction referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I am reading here from the Department of State's report\r\nto the Commission, and it cites the text of that. Do you wish me to\r\nread it over?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. All right, it says this looks like it is \"Note 3.3.\r\nMembership in mass organizations rank and file membership in proscribed\r\nmass organizations, in Communist and Communist controlled countries\r\nmay in general, if police repression or political or economic\r\ndiscrimination is or was the coercive factor bringing about such\r\nmembership, be considered involuntary within the meaning of section\r\n212(a)28I(i) of the act unless the alien actively participated in\r\nthe organization's activities or joined or remained connected with\r\nit because of political or ideological conviction. When an alien\r\nis refused a visa because of voluntary membership in a proscribed\r\norganization of this type the report submitted to the Department\r\npursuant to appendix A22 CFR 42.13 on note 1 should show the\r\ncircumstances leading to the decision.\"\r\n\r\nI should note that the text of that is confidential, as a part of\r\nconfidential appendix A.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you interviewed Marina and took the facts, that you\r\ndetermined that her membership in the Soviet Trade Union for Medical\r\nWorkers was involuntary?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. It appeared to be involuntary.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Suppose Marina had told you that she was a member of the\r\nKomsomol, what would you have done then?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That comes under a more complicated type of instruction.\r\nThe membership in the Komsomol may be found to be involuntary and is on\r\noccasion found involuntary. But you have to investigate more carefully\r\nunder the regulations into the nature of the membership, because\r\nwhereas if a person is a member, works in a factory, everybody in the\r\nfactory belongs to the trade union.\r\n\r\nBut if you are going to the university, not everybody is a member of\r\nthe Komsomol, although a high percentage of them are.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to say high school, why their membership in the\r\nKomsomol is even more in the nature of a minority, and so I had\r\nexperience in this same matter considering visas for a number of\r\ndifferent wives of American citizens, and when the Komsomol was\r\ninvolved, why the results varied considerably.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it was found that membership in the Komsomol was\r\ncompletely routine and merely because the people really were hoping\r\nto get a decent education and a good job and didn't participate in it\r\nactively.\r\n\r\nIn another case I recall, particularly a girl who had been one of the\r\nleaders in the Komsomol, and this was clearly beyond the definition of\r\ninvoluntary, and this was part of, was a consideration which entered\r\ninto the denial of her visa in Washington.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In that case, the latter one, there was a denial?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. There was a denial, yes, but this was because--and\r\nit is a difficult thing to be in a position to say that somebody's\r\nwife shouldn't go with him to the States, but this was the law and\r\nthe question was looked into with a great deal of detail, and based\r\nlargely upon this particular other person's statements in a number of\r\ninterviews, why it is clear, the facts.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, after the memorandum of August 28, 1961, which is\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 944, did you have anything else to do with Lee\r\nOswald or his wife Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I don't think so, because I left almost immediately\r\nafterward, and I had nothing more to do with the case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When you made the decision: (1) That Marina's petition for\r\nimmigration should be granted, and (2) recommended that there should be\r\na waiver of the sanction provided by section 243(g), did anyone tell\r\nyou or request that you make this decision?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Now one thing. I want to be sure we are accurate on my\r\nfunction. I was merely recommending these things. I was not making a\r\ndecision. I was recommending a favorable advisory opinion from the\r\nsecurity point of view from the Department of State. I was recommending\r\nthe approval of the visa petition to grant her the status under the\r\nquota system of the wife of an American citizen, and I was recommending\r\nthat the immigration service waive the sanctions imposed by 243(g),\r\nprincipally because she was the wife of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nBut this was my responsibility to make these recommendations, and I\r\ndid so of my own free will as the officer-in-charge of this particular\r\naspect of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No one called you and asked you to do it?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No, no; it was my responsibility to look into the matter\r\nand make the recommendation and I did.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And did you have any other facts in your possession or in\r\nyour knowledge other than those which were set forth in the memorandum\r\ndated August 28, 1961, concerning whether Marina was eligible for\r\nadmission as a nonquota immigrant?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; as far as I know the facts are as stated right there,\r\nand these facts were obtained from here on the basis of an interview\r\nwith her, a personal interview.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have no other questions.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. McVickar, in your memorandum dated April 7,\r\n1964, in the first paragraph you say: \"Although I now regret that I\r\nmade no notes on this even then unusual case, the following points seem\r\nto me to lend weight to my suggestion especially considering the youth\r\nand relative inexperience of the subject.\"\r\n\r\nWas the Oswald case in October of 1959 a then unusual case?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; because we had had only a few people in the category\r\nof defectors, and at that point I think we might have had--this was\r\nthe third one that had come up since I had been there, and the other\r\ntwo were much less aggressive, much less determined, and much less\r\nself-possessed people.\r\n\r\nOne of them turned out to be suffering from various mental diseases,\r\nand another one was a very weak individual who had been sort of lead\r\nastray by some Russian female agent, but this was a man who had, you\r\nknow, he came directly and walked in, slammed his passport down. It was\r\nan unusual case from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the next paragraph you discuss in this\r\nmemorandum the entry of Oswald into the Soviet Union through Helsinki.\r\nIs there any other port of entry into the Soviet Union that is\r\ncomparable to Helsinki in the context you are using it here?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, yes; there are a number of other ways to get into\r\nthe Soviet Union. I would think by far the most used one is to arrive\r\nat the airport in Moscow. And then frequently used by people who have\r\nnot very much means, would be to come by rail from Western Europe by\r\nway of Warsaw and the port of entry in that case is Brest. One could\r\nalso come by sea into Odessa. It would not be unusual to arrive by air\r\nin Leningrad.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But in this memorandum in that paragraph you say,\r\n\"He would have to have known the not too obvious fact that Helsinki\r\nis an unusual and relatively uncomplicated point of entry to the\r\nSoviet Union (one that the Soviets might well choose, for example, if\r\narranging the passage themselves).\"\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there any other port such as Helsinki, in the\r\ncontext you are using it?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I am sorry, I hope I haven't confused the record. Of\r\ncourse, when you are actually talking about a port of entry, Helsinki\r\nis not a port of entry. It is a point of departure for the Soviet\r\nUnion, and you could come in and land at the Moscow airport from\r\nHelsinki.\r\n\r\nWhat I think--what I was referring to is a point of departure for the\r\nSoviet Union which would then be more likely to be Copenhagen, for\r\nexample, or Warsaw or Vienna. Helsinki is a frequently used one, but it\r\nis way up north and it is----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Wasn't he traveling by boat, however?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. He traveled by boat to Helsinki.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is where the boat went?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No; he traveled by boat to Le Havre, France. He then went\r\nby boat from there to London but then he flew by plane from London to\r\nHelsinki.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He did? He went by plane?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I didn't realize that. But he flew from London to\r\nHelsinki and then entered the Soviet Union from Helsinki.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. By rail?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. By rail.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is so unusual and relatively uncomplicated\r\nabout Helsinki as a point of entry?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, I was thinking of this in the terms of a person who\r\ndidn't know the situation and wasn't very familiar with it, and I think\r\nthat it might be more logical to try to fly into the Soviet Union from\r\nCopenhagen or directly from London.\r\n\r\nIt might be more logical for some people to take the train into the\r\nSoviet Union through Warsaw.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where did he get his visa?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. He got his visa in Helsinki.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is it then. I think that is the answer to the thing.\r\nIt is much easier to get a visa right there than go through the mill of\r\na great place like London or Paris or any of the other places.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So it is the ease of getting the visa.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would think the ease of getting a visa there. If you\r\ncould get it at all, you could get somebody to pay some attention to\r\nyou. There, in London, you would have a much bigger problem, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. And it may be that the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki is\r\naccustomed to processing unusual cases or something. But my point is\r\nthat if a completely ignorant person might well apply for his visa in\r\nParis or in London, and then go in from there, but you have to know a\r\nlittle bit about what you are doing if you go straight to Helsinki and\r\nget your visa there. I am afraid this is a rather marginal point, but I\r\nthought it was worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had he made any attempt to get a visa or to announce that\r\nhe was going to try to pick up a visa in Helsinki? Do you know if he\r\ntook any steps at all with the Soviet authorities prior to arriving in\r\nHelsinki?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. This I do not know what is known about that. It did seem\r\nto me that he moved very quickly, if he could arrive in Helsinki and\r\nthen get his visa and go right into the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, the fact that he didn't go by ship from New Orleans\r\nto Helsinki but he went to Le Havre by boat and then to London but\r\nthen flew to Helsinki, doesn't that change somewhat the thrust of your\r\nparagraph?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I must say that it explains a little bit more\r\nclearly how he was able to get all this done in such a relatively short\r\ntime, because he would have saved himself, oh, at least a week of time,\r\nI should think, if he got off in France and flew from there on.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can any ordinary tourist, unknown tourist, just go to\r\nHelsinki and get a visa there and pick it up and get into Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; I think an ordinary tourist can go to any one of\r\ntheir Embassies and get a visa.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do they have authority, do you know, to do that without\r\nreferring back to Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; for tourist visas they do, and in fact they can go\r\nand get their visas at travel agencies. But it still takes a little\r\ntime ordinarily to arrange it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On page 3 of your memorandum of April 7, 1964,\r\nparagraph 8, you say:\r\n\r\n\"My impression was that in the Soviet Union such a privilege would not\r\nhave been usual.\"\r\n\r\nYou are referring, of course, to the allegations made that he had been\r\na member of a rifle club and did target shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why do you have that impression?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, I was thinking particularly in terms of his having\r\nbeen a foreigner, and of course strictly on the assumption that he did\r\nbelong to a rifle club, and I don't know that to be a fact.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Let's assume the fact that he did.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Yes; and this again is only based on the impression that\r\nI gathered from such contacts as I may have had while I was there, and\r\nI had the impression that sporting activities in the Soviet Union are\r\norganized as a part of the state effort, and that there might have\r\nto be some good purpose to be served by the state for a person to\r\nparticipate in such a club.\r\n\r\nAnd that the usual purpose would be international competition, and that\r\npeople who are sportsmen in the Soviet Union generally do this, they\r\nare given time off from their work to do this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that sometimes they are really almost full time\r\nengaged in whatever the sport is, and that they only have another job\r\nto be able to say that they have amateur status.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you ever been to Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I have only passed through Minsk on the train several\r\ntimes going back and forth to Poland.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you feel from your experiences in the Soviet\r\nUnion it was unusual for Oswald to be sent or permitted to go to Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. No; I don't think that is particularly unusual. I have a\r\nfeeling that what they were trying to do probably was, at least a part\r\nof what they were trying to do, was to take advantage of his competence\r\nand knowledge in the electronic field, and so they probably sent him to\r\na place where they would have technicians qualified to learn from him.\r\n\r\nThe same thing was done in the case of the immediately previous\r\ndefector, Mr. Webster, who was a glass expert--what do they call that\r\nkind of glass, foam glass?\r\n\r\nNo, fiber glass. At any rate, he was employed at the fair that we had\r\nin the Soviet Union in the summer of 1959, and he more or less defected\r\nand he was sent to a glass factory, to work at a glass factory in\r\nLeningrad, and it was logical for them to send him there because he\r\ncould do that kind of work and he could teach them something about how\r\nit was done in the United States.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you know of any special kind of schools that\r\nmight be in Minsk, any particular schools that they might send a person\r\nlike Oswald to?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. I only had the impression without being sure of my facts,\r\nthat he went to a factory where they manufactured electronic equipment.\r\nI don't know of any particular school that he might have been going to.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I want to straighten out if I can this question of the\r\ndelay in the issuance of an exit visa for Mrs. Oswald.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Dulles, I do have to leave. Would you take\r\nover and preside as chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I want to raise this question. Now the record here in this\r\nmemorandum indicates that the exit visa to Marina was issued at least 2\r\nmonths before the State Department gave the entry permit. It seems to\r\nme to be contrary to the testimony we have previously had, because in a\r\nletter dated March 16--what is this exhibit number?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is Commission Document No. 2. It hasn't been marked\r\nas an exhibit yet.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oh, it has not been marked. I don't understand what that\r\nnumber can be.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is the number, Commission Document No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Commission Document No. 2 prepared by the State Department.\r\nIt is stated here that on March 16th the Soviet Affairs Office of the\r\nState Department advised the Visa Office of the Department of State,\r\nand in that it said that the Soviet had already issued an exit visa. So\r\nMarina had the exit visa some time before March 16, 1962.\r\n\r\nDo you know the date when the exit visa was granted?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Well, sir, I left in September of 1961, and so I don't\r\nknow the details of this part of the case, but I think it is consistent\r\nbecause--in fact, I did see in the record that the exit visa was\r\nreceived by the Embassy on about January the 12th, as I recall it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. 1962?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Of 1962, and that, therefore, the Embassy would then have\r\nproceeded with the documentation and the processing, some of which had\r\nalready been initiated to get them out.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that 5 months of the delay in their getting out was\r\nAmerican regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. Sir, I cannot speak for that part of it because I don't\r\nknow about that personally. I think it is possible that it may have had\r\nsomething to do with Oswald's personal arrangements and that sort of\r\nthing, or maybe the Soviet--I just don't know. I do know that it was\r\nour policy to expedite these operations as quickly as possible after\r\nthese exit visas took place.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I only know that this exhibit that I referred to states, if\r\nI can take your date of January 12, 1962, for the date that the exit\r\nvisa was issued to Mrs. Oswald, the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService did not agree to the waiver of section 243 (g) until May 9,\r\n1962.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. That would have been something that had been going on in\r\nWashington then, and I just don't know. It may be. I don't know what\r\nconsiderations would have taken place.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that if we take the time it took them to get their\r\nexit visas, you have got to subtract really 5 months for American\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nI am not criticizing the regulations or the study that was given to it\r\nor whether they did or did not grant it. I am just referring to the\r\nquestion of the time, so that in considering the remarkably short time\r\nit took these two to get out, 5 months were American regulations, or\r\napproximately 5 months, if the January 12 date is correct. No; it would\r\nbe 4 months, wouldn't it, February, March, April, May, 4 months were\r\nAmerican regulations.\r\n\r\nMr. McVICKAR. It does look as though at that time there was a certain\r\namount of consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am not blaming anyone for giving this the fullest\r\npossible consideration. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have some exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. For the record, Commission Exhibit No. 911 which is the\r\nMcVickar memorandum of November 17, 1959.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n911 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 941, which is the McVickar\r\nmemorandum of November 27, 1963.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n941 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 942, which is the note which Mr.\r\nMcVickar wrote for the Oswald file on November 9, 1959.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n942 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 943, which is a copy of the\r\ntelegram from John E. Pic to Lee Oswald in care of the American Embassy\r\nin Moscow.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n943 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 944, which is the Operations\r\nMemorandum, dated August 28, 1961.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n944 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 945, which is a photostatic copy\r\nof the handwritten notes which Mr. McVickar made when he interviewed\r\nMarina Oswald in the Embassy on July 10 or July 11, 1961.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n945 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 959, which is a copy of the\r\npetition to classify status of alien for issuance of immigrant visa\r\nfilled out by Lee Oswald on behalf of Marina Oswald in July 1961.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n959 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And also Commission Exhibit No. 958, which is the\r\nmemorandum of Mr. McVickar, dated April 7, 1964.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n958 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are we going to admit as exhibits this State\r\nDepartment answer?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; I thought when we finished with Mr. Chayes then\r\nwe will offer all the exhibits, and during that time I was going\r\nto identify the State Department earlier memorandum and the other\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All this will then go in.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Oh, yes; that is all going in.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it is well to get that one document\r\nparaphrased, but I think from what Mr. Chayes said the other one, there\r\nshouldn't be any problem.\r\n\r\nUnless there is something else the Commission will recess until 9\r\no'clock tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 6:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, June 10, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ABRAM CHAYES, BERNICE WATERMAN, HON. DEAN RUSK, SECRETARY\r\nOF STATE, AND FRANCES G. KNIGHT\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:10 a.m., on June 10, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald Ford, and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; William T. Coleman,\r\nJr., assistant counsel; W. David Slawson, assistant counsel; Thomas\r\nEhrlich, special assistant, Department of State; Leon Jaworski, special\r\ncounsel to the attorney general of Texas; Robert D. Johnson, Legal\r\nDepartment, Passport Division, Department of State; and Charles Murray,\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ABRAM CHAYES RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will come to order. Mr. Chayes is on the\r\nstand. Mr. Coleman, you may continue the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, at the adjournment of your testimony\r\nyesterday, we were talking about section 51.136, State Department\r\nregulations dealing with the issuance of passports.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you tell us the circumstances in which the State\r\nDepartment feels it can refuse a passport based upon the regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; there are some fairly regular categories of refusals\r\nunder that section. The first is a violation of a travel restriction.\r\nAs you know, the section has from time to time placed certain areas out\r\nof bounds for travel by U.S. citizens without a specially validated\r\npassport.\r\n\r\nI think, yesterday, Mr. Dulles read into the record, from the Oswald\r\npassport, the then applicable area restrictions. And if a person having\r\na passport violates these restrictions, let's say travels to Communist\r\nChina without a specifically validated passport, we regard that as\r\nwarranting the withdrawal of the passport under section 51.136.\r\n\r\nNow I have to say that I think in one case, the case of William Worthy,\r\na withdrawal of a passport under those circumstances was sustained.\r\nHowever, when he later traveled without a passport, and then reentered\r\nthe country without a passport, which is a violation of the passport\r\nlaws as they read on the books, he was indicted and prosecuted in the\r\ndistrict court, convicted, and on appeal the conviction was reversed\r\non the ground that it was unconstitutional to make reentry, without a\r\npassport, an offense. That case has not been appealed to the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that the case that was in the Fifth Circuit?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It came up from the Federal District Court in Florida?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. New Orleans, it came up from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This applies to American citizens of course?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. American citizens. Only American citizens can get\r\npassports. When we are dealing with aliens, we are in the visa area.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Now the travel restrictions, the area restrictions are\r\nunder attack in a number of other cases, that come up in different\r\nprocedural ways. But we have in the past, and will continue to do so\r\nuntil we are told otherwise, withdrawn passports under 51.136 from\r\npeople who have violated travel restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe next category is fugitives from justice. There if a person is under\r\nindictment or even if there is a warrant for his arrest, certainly if\r\nhe has been convicted, we will not issue a passport to him to permit\r\nhim to depart. In the Kent case, the Supreme Court recognized this as\r\none of the well-defined categories in which the Secretary's discretion\r\nto withhold a passport was confirmed by practice and experience.\r\n\r\nAs I say, the fugitive from justice category is one that operates on\r\nthe whole within the United States. If a man is abroad and is indicted,\r\nwe will not ordinarily withdraw his passport abroad or mark his\r\npassport good only for direct return to the United States. We never\r\narticulated the rationale for that, but essentially it doesn't really\r\nfall within our notion of (a), (b), or (c) of 51.136, and our motion\r\nis that the remedy against persons abroad who are charged with crime\r\nis extradition rather than the use of the passport power to get them\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nNow, a third category is passport fraud, where someone has in fact\r\nacted in one way or another to make fraudulent use of the passport\r\nitself. We have withdrawn passports under those circumstances.\r\n\r\nThen there is a miscellaneous category, which doesn't include too many.\r\nFor instance, in one case a man was convicted in the Federal Republic\r\nof Germany for attempting to acquire knowledge of state secrets.\r\nAnother man had been involved in a number of fraudulent schemes in\r\nvarious countries, issued worthless checks. He was arrested in\r\nAustralia for fraud and subsequently convicted and sentenced to jail\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnother one paid for his passport renewal with a worthless check. That\r\nin itself is perhaps in the passport fraud category. Left the United\r\nStates paying for his passage with a worthless check. He represented\r\nhimself to be an employee of the U.S. Government on leave and continued\r\nto put out worthless checks, using his passport for identification. We\r\nhave summarized these actions under these categories in a letter which\r\nI sent to Mr. Rankin, on June 6. It contains a list of the actions in\r\nthese categories in the years 1962-64--through March of 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Can the record note that the original of that letter has\r\nbeen given Commission Exhibit No. 949?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Very good. Now it should be said that there is one category\r\nhere that does not appear in the list that we have attached to the\r\nletter, although it is explained in a paragraph, the third paragraph\r\nof the letter, and that is in fact the category that Oswald himself\r\nwas in, in 1961, when he wanted to come back. That is where there is\r\na person abroad who is in some kind of trouble at the time, or who is\r\nanxious to leave where he is and come right back to the United States,\r\nas Oswald did.\r\n\r\nWe issue a passport as the regulation says, for direct and immediate\r\nreturn to the United States. And that action is taken under section\r\n136. But since it is taken abroad, heretofore there has been no central\r\nlist of the actions of that kind in the Department's files. As a result\r\nof the Commission's inquiry a list is being maintained from here on\r\nout, but it is not possible without going through a million passport\r\nfiles, to find when action of that kind was taken in the past. I know\r\nof a number of cases of my own knowledge where this happened.\r\n\r\nFor example, one or two, a man and his wife, of the students who went\r\nto Cuba last year went on to Morocco, and got into trouble with the\r\nMoroccan police and so on, and we marked their passport for immediate\r\nreturn. I am told that the names of those two students are listed under\r\ncategory (a), in 1963 on the list. Their passports were withdrawn\r\nbecause they had violated the travel restrictions, but also, for\r\nmost of the students we didn't do anything about the passports until\r\nthey got back to the United States when we withdrew them, but in\r\ntheir particular case, because they got in trouble with the Moroccan\r\nauthorities and were pretty obstreperous about it, we marked their\r\npassport good only for direct and immediate return.\r\n\r\nAnother case that I remember, in my own experience, was a case of\r\na notorious gun runner in the Congo, who was running guns to the\r\nKatangese rebels during the Congo operation, and he was apprehended\r\nby the Congolese authorities. We didn't want him to be tried, and the\r\nCongolese didn't want to try him if we didn't want him to be tried. On\r\nthe other hand they didn't want him around there either.\r\n\r\nSo we marked his passport good for direct and immediate return. In\r\nother words, those cases are cases where you can find either some form\r\nof trouble which makes the applicant, the passport holder want to go\r\ndirectly home, and us want to make him go directly home, or some very\r\nimmediate and direct relation to our relations with that particular\r\ncountry. And as I said yesterday, we have taken the view that it can\r\nnever be done solely, because of political activities or political\r\nassociations or the exercise of speech. It has to be something beyond\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it that judgment is effected in part by the holding\r\nof the Supreme Court in the _Kent_ v. _Dulles_ case.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; it derives from that. The Kent case said that the\r\nSecretary was not entitled without statutory authorization, at least\r\nas we have read the case, was not entitled in the absence of statute,\r\nto withhold a passport on grounds related to political association and\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yesterday you testified that you had reviewed all of the\r\nState Department files dealing with Oswald, and you paid attention\r\nto those files as they existed as of June 1963, and that it was your\r\njudgment that the Passport Office could not have refused to issue a\r\npassport to Oswald in June 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is my judgment that the passport was properly issued in\r\nJune of 1963; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You know that in October 1963, the Passport Office\r\nreceived information that Mr. Oswald had been at the Russian Embassy in\r\nMexico. Would that information have changed the result at all, in your\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, sir; that information by itself could not have affected\r\nthe result. As a matter of fact, as you know, the passport application\r\nitself indicated that Oswald wanted to travel to Russia, and the mere\r\nfact that he had gone to the Russian Embassy in Mexico, would not of\r\nitself have been a disqualifying event.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Even despite the past history?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think that is correct. In other words, by itself it\r\ndoesn't disqualify the applicant because there is no suggestion here\r\nthat even--first of all could I review the message that came in on\r\nOctober 16, to the Department. I think I may have it in my own document\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. All that is suggested here is that he was in the Embassy\r\nand he contacted the Soviet Embassy about a telegram which had been\r\nsent. Now, there is nothing from that, I don't think, that adds\r\nanything or permits us to infer in any way that his travel abroad would\r\nbe inimical to the foreign policy of the United States or otherwise\r\nharmful to the national interest, or that he was going abroad to\r\nviolate U.S. law.\r\n\r\nI think this can be said, and I don't think it should be said in\r\ncriticism of the people who made the decision at the time, because I\r\nthink the decision at the time and on the basis of our procedures and\r\non the basis of our experience was proper.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask at that point----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May he finish? He hadn't finished that statement.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I was going to say looking at it in retrospect and knowing\r\nwhat we now know, it seems to me it would have been desirable to have\r\nhad some means for triggering off a further investigation of this kind,\r\nof a passport applicant, or a passport holder, on the basis of that\r\nkind of information. If the further investigation had turned nothing\r\nelse up, it seems to me clear that he was entitled to a passport on the\r\nstate of the file as it then existed.\r\n\r\nThe only issue is whether the state of the file showed enough to start\r\nor to instigate a further investigation of the purpose and plans for\r\nhis travel abroad. What you could have done is hard to speculate about.\r\nYou might have called him in and asked him about his travel plans.\r\nYou might have made inquiries among friends and relatives about his\r\nplans, and so on, and that might have turned up evidence that would\r\nhave suggested that his proposed travel abroad fell within one of these\r\ncategories and it would have warranted the withdrawal of his passport.\r\n\r\nBecause of our review of these procedures, in the light of what\r\nhappened, as we said yesterday, we now have established a defector\r\ncategory in the lookout card file, and people of this kind who apply\r\nfor passports now won't get them routinely, even though the state of\r\nthe file as it then exists would warrant the issuance of a passport.\r\nBut there will be a review of the file and any necessary further or any\r\nindicated further investigatory steps, if a defector does apply for a\r\npassport. You say why didn't you have those procedures before?\r\n\r\nWhy did it take this kind of a thing to do it? To stimulate a new\r\nprocedure? The answer is simply that nothing in our past experience\r\nat all suggested anything like this kind of trouble. Of course the\r\nultimate result, the ultimate assassination wasn't related in any way\r\nto the passport decisions. But it has drawn our attention more closely\r\nto the problem of defectors in this connection.\r\n\r\nI should add one general point, and that is when we talk about\r\npassports in this context, we tend to emphasize the very, very few\r\nbad apples of one kind or another, and they are very few, who are\r\nnot entitled to passports. But the fact is that the function of the\r\nPassport Office is not to deny passports to people. It is to get\r\npassports to people. The Passport Office puts out 1 million passports\r\na year. The great overwhelming majority of those people are ordinary\r\nAmerican citizens who want to get abroad for business or pleasure,\r\nand the ability of the Passport Office to furnish them with passport\r\nfacilities, in very short order, is of tremendous service, and\r\ntremendous convenience to them.\r\n\r\nThat is the primary function of the Passport Office. It has of course\r\nthe duty of administering these denial and withdrawal statutes. But\r\nthat is not its primary function. Its primary function is to get\r\npassport facilities to the great bulk of Americans who have legitimate\r\nbusiness abroad. It is dealing with a million or more applications a\r\nyear, and millions of bits of information, like this piece we have just\r\nbeen talking about. I think when you see things in that perspective it\r\nis perhaps easier to evaluate some of the decisions and some of the\r\nactions taken here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But I think you have to turn the coin over. There\r\nare millions of passport applications, or a million plus. But there are\r\nonly very few such as Mr. Oswald, or people in the defector category.\r\nSo the problem there I don't think is as serious an administrative one\r\nas you would tend to imply.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; I am not suggesting it is, and in fact I think we have\r\nby a relatively simple administrative action taken the steps which will\r\nassure that in the future applications from this kind of person will\r\nreceive a more elaborate review.\r\n\r\nAll I am saying is that if you ask why that wasn't done before, it is\r\nbecause the experience didn't indicate that there was a problem, and\r\nthat is because that isn't the main business of the Passport Office.\r\nIts main business is not the business of a security agency which goes\r\naround focusing or is supposed to be focusing on security problems. Its\r\nmain business is that of a processing agency.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But we have vast resources of people in the\r\nGovernment who are, or who do have security as a main business, and it\r\nseems to me that it is vitally important that those people and those\r\nvast resources somehow tie into the administrative process of denying\r\nor refusing passports under unique circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. They do. That is any of those agencies can levy a request\r\non the Passport Office for notification when a passport is issued to\r\nany person. If the FBI or the CIA or the Secret Service or any other\r\nsecurity or law enforcement agency is interested, or the U.S. court,\r\nthe Federal district court or the district attorney's office, any\r\nagency of that kind which is interested in knowing whether a particular\r\nperson has applied for passport facilities may levy a request. That\r\nrequest would be serviced by placing a lookout card in the file which\r\nwould then automatically involve notification of that agency when that\r\nperson applied for a passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Isn't there a broader point than that though, because the\r\nsecurity agencies don't know in all cases what requirements to levy.\r\nNow if in this case, for example, in the Oswald case, if there had been\r\nthis lookout card, and you had notified let's say the FBI and the CIA\r\nthat the former defector had applied for a passport and might be going\r\nabroad, then they can put in a card, and then they can be helpful in\r\nfollowing that situation abroad. But they don't know, if they don't\r\nknow that Oswald is going to apply, they have no way of putting in\r\ntheir requirements.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases they can. But in a great many cases they cannot.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, let me make two points. First, now under the new\r\nmemorandum as to defectors, the FBI and CIA and other security agencies\r\nwill automatically be notified whether they have made a request or not.\r\n\r\nSecond, as to most people who have lookout cards, the FBI and the other\r\nsecurity agencies couldn't care less about whether they apply for\r\npassports. Most of the lookout cards relate to loss of nationality, not\r\nsecurity issues at all. So that there is a problem both ways. We can't,\r\nthe Department can't--it could notify the security agencies whenever a\r\nlookout card, a person as to whom there was a lookout card applied for\r\na passport.\r\n\r\nBut in 9 out of 10 cases that would be so much waste paper for the\r\nsecurity agency. There has to be a reciprocal effort at cooperation.\r\nThere is a reciprocal effort at cooperation, and by and large it works\r\nvery well. By and large when the FBI is interested in somebody, it\r\ntells the Passport Office it is interested in them and they want to\r\nknow if he comes for a passport.\r\n\r\nBy and large the Passport Office knows people whom the FBI is\r\ninterested in, and when they apply for a passport or something like\r\nthat, there is an exchange of information. It is interesting that this\r\nCIA report got to the Passport Office. It is a matter of routine. All\r\nsecurity reports of this kind that originate in the security agencies,\r\ncopies go to the Passport Office and are put in the passport file. So\r\nthat there is a great deal of coordination. But in the nature of things\r\nit can't be a perfect system when the two kinds of responsibilities are\r\ndifferently allocated, the security responsibility in one case and the\r\nother responsibility in another.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did the CIA report of the Mexican trip get\r\ninto the passport file?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is not clear to me here. It is probably about 10-11-63\r\nis what it looks like to me from the date, October 11, 1963. But on the\r\nother hand, note that this report--we pay a great deal of attention\r\nto the fact that it got into the passport file. But the report itself\r\noriginated in the CIA.\r\n\r\nCopy of it went to the FBI. In other words, all the security agencies\r\nthemselves knew of this fact. As I say, myself, I think it did not\r\nchange the character of the file so as to warrant the withdrawal of a\r\npassport from the passport administration point of view. But even if we\r\nhad taken steps to withdraw the passport, it is hard to see how it had\r\nany impact on the result at all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Leave aside the tragic result. Under your\r\ncurrent procedures if such a situation developed, would there be an\r\nadministrative step taken to try and retrieve the passport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Under current procedures what would have happened in\r\nJune, when he first made application, was that there would have\r\nbeen a lookout card in the file, and before automatically issuing a\r\npassport there would have been a review of the file and some further\r\ninvestigative steps. Now that investigation would have inquired into\r\nthe purpose of travel abroad, and a determination would then have\r\nbeen made whether the purpose of travel on the basis of the file--and\r\nremember when we do deny a passport we are then subject to hearing,\r\nadministrative hearing and judicial review, and we have got to make\r\nthe denial and the evidence on which it is based stand up in those\r\ncircumstances--but if we determined that there was a basis then for\r\ndenial we would have denied it then. So the question wouldn't have\r\narisen later in October. If at the time in June we had determined after\r\ninvestigation that there was no basis for denial, then the passport\r\nwould have been issued, and if a matter of this kind had come in, there\r\nwould have been, I suppose, an administrative determination to decide\r\nwhether, in the light of the earlier investigation, whether this new\r\ninformation warranted any further action or further investigation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would it be your judgment that the June\r\ndetermination, using your new criteria, would have resulted in a\r\nrefusal of this passport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Not on the basis of the file as then existed. It is hard\r\nto answer your hypothetical question because under our new procedures\r\nthere would have been a further investigation that would either have\r\nturned up some additional material, or would have left the file in\r\nits present state. If there was no additional material suggesting the\r\nevil purposes or improper purposes for travel, the decision to give a\r\npassport would have been the same as it was on the file. On the basis\r\nof the file, the decision was properly made.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you in the June determination have had the\r\nfiles from the Department of State which showed that on October 31\r\nOswald walked into the American Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And said \"I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request\r\nthat my present citizenship in the United States of America be revoked.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, yes; the entire file.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And would it also have had the one of November 3d\r\nwhere he said \"I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my present\r\nUnited States citizenship be revoked\"?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; It would have had all of that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It would have had all of that?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And it would have had the----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. But it would also have had the determination that he had\r\nfailed to expatriate himself and that he was an American citizen. I,\r\nmyself, doubt that an abortive attempt at expatriation would, certainly\r\nwithout more, warrant the denial of a passport to a person who was in\r\nfact a citizen.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And a person who in his application in June of\r\n1963, indicated he wanted to return to the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. One of the places he wanted to travel to was Russia. I\r\nthink if you add those two together, and all you have is his intention\r\nto travel to Russia, and the fact that he made an abortive attempt\r\nto expatriate himself in Russia sometime before, I don't think you\r\nhave the basis for a finding in terms of the regulation that persons,\r\nactivities abroad would \"violate the laws of the United States, be\r\nprejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations or otherwise be\r\nprejudicial to the interests of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nI think you have got the basis for a finding that this is not a very\r\nattractive fellow, but I don't see how you can bring him within any of\r\nthose categories on the basis of the evidence in the file.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it not correct though that when you were trying to\r\nget the visa for Mrs. Oswald, you made a very strong case that his\r\ncontinued residence in the Soviet Union was harmful to the foreign\r\npolicy of the United States, or words to that effect?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, we were very anxious to get him back and I think\r\nthat is right. In a sense we had him on our hands then. We were in\r\ndiscussion with him. He was in the Embassy and he was very directly\r\nour responsibility, so that anything that he did or that went wrong\r\nduring that period, he was under our protection and we were necessarily\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nIf he went back as a tourist and got into some trouble of some kind or\r\nanother, we would then have the choice I think to get involved, and\r\nwe might or might not. The situation it seems to me is different when\r\na fellow is already in trouble and you have taken steps to put the\r\nU.S. Embassy in the picture. Then you have a special responsibility\r\nif anything goes off the track and you want to take whatever steps\r\nyou can to shorten the time in which you are bearing that special\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think, Mr. Chayes, however, you are saying or\r\nyou are inferring that it was a clear-cut decision back when it was\r\ndetermined that he had not given up his United States citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It was in July of 1961, when his passport was renewed.\r\nWe couldn't have had a passport renewal if there weren't such a\r\ndetermination, and in fact there was such a determination.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was such a determination?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is correct, but it was not a clear-cut case\r\nwhen you look at the steps that he, Lee Harvey Oswald, tried to take.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I don't know----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It was a determination, but it was not one that\r\nwas absolutely all black or white.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, but once you make the decision on the basis of whatever\r\nis before you, he is either a citizen or he is not a citizen, and I\r\nthink he is a citizen, or was a citizen.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But the fact that the matter was administratively\r\ninvestigated ought to, I would think under your new regulations,\r\nwhen he applies to go back to the country where he originally sought\r\ncitizenship, there ought to be some real investigation, and I am\r\nsurprised that you say that under those regulations, under these facts,\r\nhe probably would still be given a passport.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I agree with the first part of your statement, that\r\nunder the new regulations, as we have developed them in the light of\r\nhindsight, there would be a further investigation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you also said----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. And I think there should.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He would then be given his passport again despite\r\nthe new regulation.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. But if the investigation turned up no more than what was in\r\nthe file with respect to his purposes for travel abroad, if we didn't\r\nhave some hard factual evidence to support a finding that his travel\r\nwould fall within one of these three categories in 51.136, then the\r\npassport would be issued. We have to start from the proposition that\r\nthe Supreme Court has said that the right to travel is a part of the\r\nliberty protected by the fifth amendment, and that the Secretary cannot\r\nwithhold a passport arbitrarily. Now we have taken the position, I\r\nthink properly so, that in order to justify withholding under one of\r\nthese three subsections of 51.136, there has to be a real and concrete\r\nshowing that the travel either would violate the laws of the United\r\nStates, be prejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations, or\r\notherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nAdd to that that you can't make that finding on the basis of, let's\r\nsay, political activity abroad. Suppose we could show, for example,\r\nthat Oswald was going to the Soviet Union to make a speech before the\r\nSupreme Soviet telling how terrible things were in the United States\r\nand how bad the U.S. policies toward Cuba were, for example.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would that preclude him from getting a passport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No. We have people abroad who are doing that all the time.\r\nWe have got Malcolm X traveling across Africa making one speech after\r\nthe other about how terrible our policies on the race question are.\r\nAnd it is perfectly clear to me on the basis of the cases--although we\r\nmight get a little more information in the next couple of weeks, we\r\nhave a case before the Chief Justice now--but it is clear to me on the\r\nbasis of the cases so far that if what is involved is speech, no matter\r\nhow hostile it is to our policies or our objectives, you can't deny a\r\npassport for that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What about Oswald's statements to either Mr.\r\nSnyder or Mr. McVickar that he as a former Marine was going to\r\ngive information he had acquired as a former Marine to the Soviet\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is, of course, a more difficult one. Of course we know\r\nhe didn't have very much information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No, but he was a Marine and he had been trained\r\nas an electronics radar specialist. He said he was going to give this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. But the second point is that on the whole these criteria\r\nlook to the future. They look to the purpose of this travel. Now if he\r\nhad committed an offense against the espionage laws or whatever it was\r\nabroad on his past performance----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This isn't a question of freedom of speech.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; I understand.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is a question of giving away Government\r\nsecrets.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, no; I don't equate the two at all. But that kind of\r\nthing I think would have been the subject of investigation under our\r\nnew procedures, and might have turned up something. I think if you\r\ncould have found, for example, that he did in the past give information\r\nof this kind, you might be in a different position.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was any investigation of that aspect made at the\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When he came back and asked for the renewal of his\r\npassport?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; but what happened was when he returned to the United\r\nStates--first of all the FBI was kept constantly informed, and as you\r\nknow kept looking into the Oswald situation periodically from the time\r\nhe came back.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And those reports were in the passport file.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. They were in the passport file, and immediately after he\r\ncame back, he was interviewed very fully by the FBI, and I think as\r\nI recall the file--I haven't reviewed it recently--I think he was\r\nquestioned on this very point by the FBI, and he said he hadn't given\r\nany and they weren't very much interested in it. And the FBI apparently\r\nwas satisfied with that. They made no further move against him on that\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nSo that we did have whatever information there was.\r\n\r\nAs I say, although this regulation looks to the purpose of the\r\nforthcoming travel and not to the past travel, nonetheless I think it\r\nis perfectly appropriate to make inferences on the basis of what he\r\ndid before. We refused to issue a passport to Worthy when he would not\r\ngive us assurances that he would observe the restrictions, because on\r\nthe basis of his past conduct, we were prepared to infer that in the\r\nabsence of such assurances, he might well disobey the restrictions.\r\n\r\nMr. Ehrlich points out to me that on May 16, 1962--this is one of\r\nseveral such memorandums--our security office sent to the FBI with\r\ncopies to the other security agencies a memorandum on the subject of\r\nAmerican defectors, and their status in the U.S.S.R., and there is a\r\nsummary of that which covers Oswald. This was just before he came home,\r\nI guess.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Will you indicate what file that is by the number?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. This is the folder II in the numbering that we gave you,\r\nand it is document No. II-6(4), in our number system.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you read or indicate what that says about Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, yes; it just summarizes his status as of that date and\r\nit says:\r\n\r\n\"Lee Oswald: It has been determined that Oswald the ex-Marine is still\r\nan American citizen. Both he and his Soviet wife now have exit permits\r\nand the Department has given approval for their travel with their\r\ninfant child to the U.S.A. There is a problem with his wife, however,\r\nin that SOV in the Department is trying to get a waiver of 243(g),\r\nwhich requires that Oswald's wife pick up her visa for entry into the\r\nU.S.A. in Western Europe. As soon as this question has been settled,\r\nthey will be free to travel.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I clarify one other point?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. May I ask him a question about that? In that file Mr.\r\nChayes isn't there also another FBI report dated August 30, 1962, which\r\nindicates that Lee Harvey Oswald was reinterviewed by the Bureau agents\r\non August 16, 1962, with respect to contacts he had made at the Soviet\r\nEmbassy in Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I would have to review the file itself, for the specific\r\ndetails as to dates and so on. I do remember that the FBI in its\r\nsubsequent inquiries talked to him about his contacts with the Soviet\r\nEmbassy. He had some, of course, in connection with his wife. They\r\nasked him whether he had had any other contacts with the Soviets and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Dulles, you had a question.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This apparently just went to the Bureau, did it not? Did it\r\ngo to the other agencies?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think the----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; it went to the CIA. Copy went to the CIA. I would like\r\nto clarify one point. It is not quite clear to me what information\r\nabout Oswald was in the passport files as distinct from the Department\r\nfiles. I didn't realize that there was much about Oswald in the\r\npassport file itself in the absence of, what do you call it, a check----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. A lookout card.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A lookout card.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; the passport file, I am holding it up.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is a big file.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is roman numeral X and it contains in our numbering\r\nsystem 80 documents or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was in the passport file itself?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. In the passport file itself. A large amount of the security\r\nmaterial is there, and of course the security file would have been\r\npulled too whenever the passport file was reviewed.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether that file was reviewed before the\r\nissuance of the passport in June 1930 or not?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I mean 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It was not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was not?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It was not, because what happened then was that the Telex\r\ncame in from New Orleans. The only thing that you do is go to the\r\nlookout card file. There was no lookout card. In the absence of a\r\nlookout card, routine approval goes out and the passport was issued\r\nfrom the New Orleans office. If there had been a lookout card, then\r\nthe lookout card would have sent them back to the file. There was no\r\nlookout card because the file as it then stood didn't have anything\r\nin it that warranted the denial of a passport, and under our then\r\nprocedures we didn't have a flag for people of this kind to stimulate a\r\nfurther inquiry or investigation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Isn't it usual in issuing a passport though to look, in\r\naddition to the lookout card, to look at the file you have on the\r\nindividual?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, sir; unless there is a lookout card, the passport is\r\nissued automatically on the basis of the local agency's determination\r\nof citizenship. There has to be evidence of citizenship.\r\n\r\nNow let me say there are different ways in which this can come up,\r\nbecause for example a man may apply for a passport before a clerk of\r\nthe court and that application would be forwarded to the Department.\r\nBut even then the Department adjudicator would first look at the\r\nlookout file. If there is no card in the lookout file, all he would\r\ndo is determine whether the application was complete, and whether\r\nsatisfactory evidence of citizenship was presented, and whether on the\r\nface of it, you know, the oath was properly taken or any supplementary\r\nquestionnaire resolved doubts.\r\n\r\nAnd then would issue the passport. If there were a supplemental\r\nquestionnaire or something like that, then he would probably go to the\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nIn our agency there are special passport issuing offices. New Orleans\r\nis one of the big ones, we have one in New York, we have some others,\r\nthere the system is very routinized.\r\n\r\nDaily, and sometimes more than once daily, the agency will telegraph by\r\nTelex the name, date, and place of birth of its applicants, the people\r\nwho have come in that day to make an application.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could we mark as Exhibit No. 952 the teletype that came in\r\non Oswald. I think that would help the Commission to indicate how it\r\ncomes in.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 952 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You had better explain the \"NO\" which is beside Oswald's\r\nname. name.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; well here you see the Telex coming in from New\r\nOrleans, and there are 25 names on it with date of birth beside each\r\nname, and it is interesting that opposite Lee Harvey Oswald is capital\r\nletters \"NO\" which might be rather interesting except that it stands\r\nfor New Orleans, and every Telex that comes from New Orleans has that\r\nmark on it. It is covered by our abbreviations manual, and one of your\r\ninvestigators made, of course with our knowledge in our office, but not\r\nin the Passport Office, a surprise visit to the Passport Office to make\r\nsure that they were, in fact, putting NO on these things, and they are.\r\n\r\nThat is the designation of the office.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is when these 25 names come in, the lookout file is\r\nsearched for those names, and if there is no lookout card, then a\r\nresponding Telex is sent back. It says here 561, OW561. That is this\r\none, \"All okay.\" OW is office to Washington. WO is Washington to\r\noffice. So the control number of the outgoing from Washington is WO38,\r\nand it says that on your OW561, all the names were okay.\r\n\r\nNow it is interesting, the Telex came in and it is stamped June 24,\r\n4:19 p.m.--June 24, 1963. It went out June 25, 10:57 a.m. and these 25\r\npeople all got the passports.\r\n\r\nNow it is only on the basis of that kind of a system that you can get\r\nout a million passports in a way that really provides first class\r\nservice to the American people. Miss Knight in her administration of\r\nthe office, which extends back into the previous administration, has\r\ncut down the time from something like 2 weeks to 24 hours in most of\r\nthe cases.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could the Passport Office itself prepare a lookout card on\r\nits own initiative on the basis let's say of a file like the Oswald\r\nfile?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It would have prepared a lookout card on any person as to\r\nwhom the file suggested that there were grounds for withdrawal, or\r\ndenial of the passport.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, at this point could we mark as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 951 the existing standard operating notice which was in\r\neffect on February 28, 1962, of the Department with respect to the\r\nlookout card system?\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 951 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you describe Commission Exhibit No. 951?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. This is the standard operating notice which covers the\r\ncategories, and if you look at them they relate each category to a\r\nground of potential disqualification.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As of what date does this read?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. February 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Now we have added by the Schwartz to Knight memorandum\r\nof recent date a defector category which differs slightly from the\r\nothers in that in all of the other categories something in the file\r\nalready suggests that the person may be ineligible for a passport. The\r\ndefector category would simply stimulate further investigation in the\r\ncase of application by such a person, and would automatically trigger\r\nnotification of the other security agencies.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How do you define the defector category, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think we have the----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would that have covered Oswald? That is what I am\r\ninterested in.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; well, it was in fact designed to cover Oswald, so\r\nthat----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It probably would have.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It would, but defector is not a statutory term or one that\r\nhas real technical significance. I have said in my own discussions with\r\npeople who have asked for guidance in administering this memorandum and\r\nothers that it is not necessarily related to an attempted renunciation\r\nof citizenship or anything else. It involves the kind of thing that if\r\nthere were a war on would be treason.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it involves something like aid and comfort to the enemy\r\nor attempted aid and comfort to the enemy. The only thing is the enemy\r\nisn't technically an enemy because we are not at war. But that requires\r\nsome judgment to decide which ones you put in and which ones you\r\nwouldn't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is a definition we could get though and put it in the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, no.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is no definition?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. If you look at the Schwartz memorandum, it says that the\r\nOswald case highlights the necessity of maintaining up-to-date lookout\r\ncards in the files of the Passport Office, \"for persons who may have\r\ndefected to Communist countries or areas or redefected. Subsequent to\r\nthe Oswald incident, I requested the Department of Defense to furnish\r\nthis office with identifying information on military personnel in this\r\ncategory. Information with respect to these military personnel has now\r\nbeen received from all three services and copies are attached.\r\n\r\n\"On the basis of the attached information, please bring up to date the\r\nlookout cards of the Passport Office.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then it simply lists the names of the people that came over from\r\nthe military.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, is the document we have marked Exhibit No.\r\n951, the standard operating notice as of February 28, 1962?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In the attachment in category K you have \"Known or\r\nsuspected Communists or subversives\" as a category on which there\r\nshould be a lookout card.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Wouldn't Mr. Oswald have fallen in that category, based\r\nupon the passport file?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't think so. There is nothing to indicate that he\r\nhad ever been a member of the Communist Party. Maybe you would have\r\nregarded his Fair Play for Cuba activities as falling within the notion\r\nsubversive. I have to say that I think K dates from an earlier period\r\nbefore the Kent Case, in which we were denying passports very broadly\r\nto a category of people who might be called subversive. Rockwell Kent\r\nhimself, Brehl, the other defendant, people as to whom there was no\r\nreal membership information, but who had generally, what had been\r\nthought of as having subversive views or connections.\r\n\r\nWith the Kent and Brehl cases, it may well have been that that category\r\nfell into some desuetude. I think it is worth inquiring of Miss Knight\r\nwhether that category was maintained after the Kent case, or whether we\r\nsimply took those out.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In the Commission Exhibit No. 951 you also have another\r\ncategory, category R, which reads: \"Individual's actions do not reflect\r\nto credit of U.S. abroad.\" Would you say that based upon the Oswald\r\nfile as it existed in the Passport Office as of June 1963, that he\r\nwould not fall in that category?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't think so when you are thinking about what this\r\nmeans. I don't think one person in a billion abroad knew Oswald or\r\nhad any such experience with him or anything else. This isn't really\r\na reflection on the United States. I suppose if you construed it that\r\nway, if somebody got drunk on the Champs Elysees he ought to be in that\r\ncategory. I don't think you can really construe it that broadly. It has\r\nto mean I am sure someone who has a really notorious course of conduct\r\nlike the kind of thing that I summarized for you on the three people in\r\nthe so-called other category when we were talking to earlier--my letter\r\nof June 6.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If you really are equating someone who is\r\nintoxicated in Paris with Oswald----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; I am not equating them in the quality of their conduct,\r\nbut for the purposes of this category \"Do not reflect credit on the\r\nUnited States abroad\" I think what that must involve is some very\r\nnotorious course of conduct which a lot of people have had a chance\r\nto see, which has somewhat serious consequences of the kind that I\r\nsummarized here \"convicted for attempting to acquire knowledge of state\r\nsecrets in Germany, fraudulent schemes, convicted for fraud,\" that kind\r\nof thing.\r\n\r\nHere is a fellow who left a trail of bad checks, using his passport as\r\nidentification and claiming to be a U.S. employee. All I am saying is\r\nthat category R, although it is a catchall category, I would conceive\r\nis construed or should be construed narrowly.\r\n\r\nLet me say further, I probably should not be testifying to this so\r\nmuch anyway because these categories are guidelines, are operational\r\nguidelines. They don't have legal consequences. And I think you ought\r\nto ask Miss Knight, who has the operational responsibility, whether the\r\nway I conceive this is correct. I may misconceive it, but I think in\r\nessence these categories are related to grounds of disqualification,\r\nand unless the conduct specified comes within the range of being a\r\nground, a basis for disqualification, I don't think the lookout card\r\nwould be made up.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Don't you have a category X, which is called \"catch card,\"\r\ndenotes limited lookout validity, not necessarily refusal situation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. So perhaps Oswald could have been put in there, couldn't\r\nhe, in that category, based upon the file?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is possible, and I suppose that is exactly what we are\r\nnow doing with defectors.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know what category----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think you ought to inquire from Miss Knight about that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I also take it you wouldn't know what goes in categories O\r\nand P, O being \"orange card, includes recent master list\" and P being\r\n\"project Carry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't personally know at all.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Let me ask you this, Mr. Chayes. Were Oswald's\r\nvarious applications and various approvals ever handled as a special\r\ncase as far as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The only applications that were handled as a special\r\ncase were the ones made in Russia for the return of his passport in\r\nthe first instance, and then the renewal of his passport. Those were\r\nhandled as a special case, both in the Embassy and in the Department.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't think very high ranking officers passed on them in\r\nthe sense of Assistant Secretaries or something like that, nonetheless\r\nthey where handled at very responsible levels in the Department. The\r\npolitical desk was consulted as well as the Bureau of Security and\r\nConsular Affairs, and a very deliberate and special decision was made.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent application, the June 1963 application, was handled as a\r\nmatter of routine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The application in the Embassy for renewal or\r\nreissuance, was that handled more expeditiously or less expeditiously\r\nthan other defector or attempted defector cases?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I couldn't say. I couldn't say because I don't have any\r\nexperience in it against which to measure it. As I reviewed the file it\r\nseemed to me to be a fairly normal kind of a file for a matter of this\r\nkind. When I say \"this kind\" I don't mean other defectors because I\r\nhave never seen any of that.\r\n\r\nBut the reporting seemed full enough, and the response came back\r\nin time. But they didn't seem to be accelerated. There were always\r\nadequate supporting memorandums indicating consultation within the\r\nDepartment on broad enough basis.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How long did it take from the actual time that he\r\nmade the application in Moscow until it was finally approved?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. He made the application on----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This is the passport?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes; in Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. He made it July 11, 1961. At that time Mr. Snyder returned\r\nto him his existing passport. The new passport, namely the one he got\r\nto travel back to the United States, was not issued until May 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Though the instruction that it could be issued was\r\nsubmitted, sent forward to the Embassy, certainly by the end of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; they were submitted subject to the Embassy being\r\nsatisfied on certain points.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be stated also that, according to the record at least, the\r\npassport was returned to him, in July, July 11. It was marked at that\r\ntime \"good for travel only for direct return to the United States.\"\r\nBut the purpose of returning it to him was so that he could apply to\r\nthe Soviet authorities for an exit document, because he believed and\r\nour people in Moscow concurred, that he couldn't get an exit document\r\nunless he had a U.S. passport.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. An exit document for himself?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. For himself.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I note in this file, looking at your passport file which\r\nis very complete, that in his passport application of June 1963 he\r\ngives as his approximate date of departure, I assume departure from\r\nthe United States, as October-December 1963. Is it the practice of the\r\nDepartment to issue passports for persons who are not leaving for 3 or\r\n4 months?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Anytime?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Anytime you want a passport, if you are entitled to one,\r\nyou get it. And you keep it even after you return. I mean if he had\r\nused it, gone out of the country and returned, if it is still within\r\nwhat is it, the 3-year period now, the passport is a valid passport and\r\nhe can depart again in the absence of some action taken looking towards\r\nwithdrawal. So that these are ambulatory documents, and there are many\r\npeople who just automatically--I don't say Oswald did this, obviously\r\nhe didn't, but there are many people who automatically renew their\r\npassport when it runs out so that they always have travel documentation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are there any other defector or attempted defector\r\ncases where the person came back and tried to get his passport? How\r\nlong did it take in those cases to go through this process?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. You mean comparable to the June application?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No; I am talking of the Moscow application.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think we did submit a report on that. Well, I am sorry,\r\nwe didn't. We did inquire whether there were any defectors who were in\r\nthe situation of the June application. We found that there was one,\r\nand he was also issued a passport routinely. But I can supply for the\r\nrecord the information as to the others.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be helpful.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. You would like to know the time from application to grant\r\nof passport in the Soviet Union for defectors or attempted defectors\r\nwho were trying to get back then to the United States?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes; if we could have that for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We will be very glad to submit it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, turning your attention to the question of\r\nthe admission of Marina Oswald to the United States as a nonquota\r\nimmigrant, I take it that since she was the wife of an American\r\ncitizen, she would be entitled to nonquota immigrant status unless she\r\nwas disqualified because she was a member of a Communist organization,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; unless she was subject to one of those\r\ndisqualifications in 212(a)(28).\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now the first decision that was made by the Embassy was\r\nthat her membership in the particular trade union was involuntary, and\r\ntherefore she was not disqualified?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I take it you reviewed the record and you concur in that\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct. It would also be made, and be made\r\nautomatically in the case of persons belonging to trade unions not in\r\nleadership positions in the trade union, and where there is no external\r\nevidence of active participation, because membership in the union is a\r\ncondition of employment in those places in the Soviet Union, and our\r\nregulations cover the point precisely.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now the other decision that was made was that the\r\nDepartment and the Immigration and Naturalization Service would waive\r\nthe provisions of section 243(g) of the Immigration and Nationality\r\nAct which provision says that a visa could not be issued from Moscow\r\nbecause the Attorney General in 1953 had placed Russia among those\r\ncountries that refused to accept Russian citizens that we wanted to\r\nsend back to Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; 243(g) is a sanction which the act provides against\r\ncountries, not against people. It is not a disqualification for a\r\nperson. If 243(g) had not been waived, Mrs. Oswald would simply have\r\ngone to Rotterdam and gotten the same visa from our consulate in\r\nRotterdam. It is a sanction against the country which is levied when,\r\nas you say, the Attorney General determines that the country refuses to\r\naccept people whom we deport who are their nationals. It gets back a\r\nlittle to the point you were making yesterday about what obligation one\r\nhas to accept his own nationals back from another country.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is a general rule of international law, isn't it, you\r\nare supposed to do it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; as a general rule of international law I suppose\r\none should accept his own nationals, but people who have expatriated\r\nthemselves wouldn't be nationals and therefore we wouldn't have to take\r\nthem back.\r\n\r\nIn any event--that is a little digression--but this sanction is a\r\nsanction designed to penalize a country which has refused to receive\r\nback its own nationals when they are deported from the United States.\r\nThat sanction was brought into play by the determination of the\r\nAttorney General made on May 26, 1953.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder whether in addition to the information that Mr.\r\nFord has requested, you could give us information, oh, say covering the\r\nlast 5 or 10 years----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think we have already.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I haven't said what I want it on. With regard to the time\r\nthat has elapsed between the application of a Soviet woman married to\r\nan American citizen, the time that is taken from her application to the\r\ntime that that application has been favorably acted upon by the Soviet\r\nUnion. In this case as far as I understand it, the Soviet Union gave\r\npermission for Mrs. Oswald to come either in December 1961 or January\r\n1962, and that because of this particular sanction you have just been\r\ndiscussing, it wasn't really cleared up until May. And therefore that\r\nthe delay was in part a delay due to American regulations rather than\r\nto Soviet regulations.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, her processing in the Soviet Union from the time she\r\nfirst started to try to get back----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Until she got an exit visa was about 6 months. It was just\r\nunder 6 months.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We have answered in our answers to your----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is a Commission Exhibit No. 960 which was just marked,\r\nwhere Mr. Chayes, under date of May 26, 1964, answered various\r\nquestions which were asked, to determine whether there was anything\r\nunusual in the way that Marina and the Oswald applications were handled\r\nby the Soviet Union and we will make that part of the record.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 960 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Does that cover this particular point?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It covers the point not for 10 years but for 3 or 4 years.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. If I can read into the record this answer, it says----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which answer is that?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Question 3, attachment A.\r\n\r\nThe relevant part is \"In the immediate post-war period there were about\r\n15 marriages in which the wife had been waiting for many years for a\r\nSoviet exit permit. After the death of Stalin the Soviet Government\r\nshowed a disposition to settle these cases. In the summer of 1953\r\npermission was given for all of this group of Soviet citizen wives\r\nto accompany their American citizen husbands to the United States.\r\nSince this group was given permission to leave the Soviet Union, there\r\nhave been from time to time marriages in the Soviet Union of American\r\ncitizens and Soviet citizens.\r\n\r\n\"With one exception it is our understanding that all of the Soviet\r\ncitizens involved have been given permission to immigrate to the United\r\nStates after waiting periods which were in some cases from 3 to 6\r\nmonths and in others much longer.\"\r\n\r\nSo that I think what Mr. Snyder said yesterday was that 6 months was\r\npar for the course. It wasn't an unusual delay, and it was fairly\r\nlow as those things went, but not something that would give you any\r\nsurprise. There were a number of other 6-month ones and there were some\r\nless.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For our records I wonder if it would be possible to be a\r\nlittle more specific, I mean to furnish us information that would be a\r\nlittle more specific on this point, because it is very hard for us to\r\ntell of the numbers how many had less than 6 months and how many had\r\nmore than 6 months.\r\n\r\nThat is the point that has been raised often you know in the press,\r\nand the charge has been made that this is very suspicious, that this\r\nwas done so soon. I think our records ought to show a good deal of\r\nspecification what that record is. I mean this is very helpful in a\r\ngeneral way but it is not very specific.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. We can do that. The further answer farther down on the next\r\npage, page 2, says for example that \"In a most recent case of this type\r\na Soviet woman married an American citizen in December of 1963 and\r\nreceived an exit visa about 2 months later.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is very helpful.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. But we will get a detailed account for the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, as I understand it, section 243(g) itself says\r\nnothing about the power of the State Department or Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service to waive its provisions.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The State Department doesn't waive the provisions. I should\r\nstart by saying that 243(g) is a section administered by the Justice\r\nDepartment and the Attorney General has primary responsibility for\r\ninterpretation and administration. The Attorney General has from the\r\nbeginning interpreted 243(g) as involving waiver power. I had never had\r\noccasion to examine the question at all until this matter came up, and\r\nI have made only a cursory examination, but I think the judgment is\r\nsound that there is waiver power under 243(g).\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I just ask one question there. Our file that I have\r\nbefore me, and your very helpful paper----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Commission Document No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Commission Document No. 2 doesn't indicate really the basis\r\non which the Texas authorities were holding up the visa. Does that\r\nappear anywhere in the record?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I don't know. It may appear in our attachment B answers. In\r\nessence it was that they thought this fellow had behaved pretty badly\r\nand he wasn't entitled to any special consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is why at this time I would like to read into the\r\nrecord part of the regulation under which they will waive. It says:\r\n\r\n\"If substantial adverse security information related to the petitioner\r\nis developed, the visa petition shall be processed on its merits and\r\ncertified to the regional commissioner for determination whether the\r\nsanction should be waived.\r\n\r\n\"The assistant commissioner shall endorse the petition to show\r\nwhether the waiver is granted or denied and forward it and notify the\r\nappropriate field officer of the action taken.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, that since some derogatory information was in the file,\r\nand since Oswald was the petitioner, the initial decision made by the\r\nfield officer of the Immigration Service was that the waiver should not\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I assume that that was motivated probably in one of the\r\nletters from the Texas immigration office to the Department of Justice\r\nor the Immigration Service here.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; well what happened, the record was referred to the\r\nimmigration field officer in Texas, and the record was the history\r\nof the fact that Oswald had defected or attempted to defect, and the\r\nstatements he had made. So they, therefore, made the determination on\r\nthe field level that they would not waive the sanction.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is right. The sanction was waived only after urging\r\nfrom the Department.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes, that appears in this Commission Exhibit, this document\r\nthat I have referred to. But we do not have in our files the letter of\r\nthe Texas immigration authorities first refusing as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We will have that. That testimony will be put in through\r\nMiss James and Miss Waterman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They have that. All right, if they supply that, that will\r\nbe adequate.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. So I take it that, in your judgment after reviewing the\r\nfile, you think that the waiver should have been granted?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I think there that it was not an improper exercise of\r\ndiscretion. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Just one other question. Is there any policy in the\r\nDepartment to delay the acceptance of attempted renunciation of\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, delay, I don't know that there is a stated policy\r\nthat you put the person off. The general policy of the Department is\r\nfirst I think to discourage renunciations, to make it clear that the\r\nperson has a right to renounce, but nonetheless to discourage them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the policy is that the consular officer should assure himself\r\nthat the person seeking to renounce his citizenship is acting soberly,\r\nrationally, and with full awareness of the meaning and consequences of\r\nhis act. And for that purpose the consular officer can use any means\r\nwithin his judgment. He can talk to the person. He could invoke a\r\ncooling-off period or ask a person to sleep on it or something of that\r\nkind. It seems to me how the policy is implemented is something for the\r\nparticular case. If somebody came up in England and had just married an\r\nearl or something like that and said \"I want to be an English citizen\r\nnow\" and was in full possession of her faculties apparently there\r\nprobably wouldn't be much worry about it, although even then the consul\r\nwould go through a routine of trying to assure that the person knew and\r\nunderstood fully what she was doing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that routine prescribed, should it be prescribed do you\r\nthink now in the light of hindsight in this situation?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; I think in each case it will depend so much on the\r\nsituation with the particular person. If a person comes in and he is\r\nvery agitated or something of that kind, it might dictate a totally\r\ndifferent approach than a different kind of thing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Wouldn't it be useful though to give--I don't want to\r\nsuggest what the Secretary of State should do in this, but in the\r\nlight of this experience, would there not be some benefit possibly in\r\ngiving people in the field the result of the experience gained in this\r\nparticular case?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, the general approach, and other matters related to\r\nit, are touched on in orientation courses for consular officers and so\r\non. I think as I look on Consul Snyder's actions, that he behaved very\r\nmuch like a responsible Foreign Service officer.\r\n\r\nThat happened long before I was in the Department, so I can say that\r\nwithout any involvement. But it seemed to me that he did just what he\r\nshould have done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to\r\nme, at least, that the training and orientation that these people are\r\ngetting is right, is serviceable, and they are able to handle these\r\nsituations as they come in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I realize that you ought not to prescribe hard and fast\r\nrules, that there is a broad range of discretion that should be\r\nexercised here. But I just raise the question as to whether a good deal\r\nof experience hasn't been gained in this case in that very field.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, it may very well be that more attention to that\r\nparticular aspect should be given in the orientation courses and so on.\r\nThose things tend to reflect what is hot at the moment you know, and if\r\nyou haven't had trouble with something for a pretty long time, it tends\r\nmaybe not to get mentioned.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If Oswald had persisted that day, October 31, in\r\ndemanding the form that is a prerequisite under your definition for\r\nrenunciation, would Snyder have been required to give it to him and\r\npermit him to sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think if it had been in ordinary office hours when the\r\nconsulate was open for business, and if Snyder was satisfied that he\r\nwas competent, that Oswald was competent, he would have to give him the\r\nform, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Does Snyder have the authority to make a\r\ndetermination of competency?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No; he doesn't have the authority to make a determination\r\nof competence, and I suppose it is possible at some point to get the\r\nissue tried in court. But I think a consular officer would probably\r\nbe acting within his discretion if he saw somebody who was drunk or\r\nraving or something and just said, \"Well, I am not going to give you\r\nthis until I am sure that your action is your act.\" After all, when the\r\nconsul accepts the oath, he is certifying that it is the act of the\r\nperson in a meaningful sense, and so if he thought that the person was\r\nincompetent, I think he would have discretion not to give the oath. But\r\nI put that far aside because in the particular case here, Mr. Snyder\r\nmade it perfectly clear that he had no reason to doubt that Oswald was\r\nfully competent.\r\n\r\nAnd so if Oswald had been there at a time when the office was open, or\r\nhad returned at a time when the office was open, and had persisted in\r\nhis demand, I think Snyder would have been under an obligation to give\r\nhim the form.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The only technical reason or basis upon which\r\nSnyder could have denied Oswald the right that day was the fact that it\r\nwas on a Saturday, a non-working-hour period of the Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; I think he had every right to try to dissuade him,\r\nor persuade him not to act or persuade him to think it over and come\r\nback the next day. But if after all of that Oswald still had said \"But\r\nI want to do it now\" and if the office was open for business, then I\r\nthink he would have had to do it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think it might be useful if it has not been done to\r\nintroduce at this point as an exhibit the form of oath of renunciation.\r\nHere is the formalized oath and I think it would be well to have this\r\nin our records unless it is already in our records.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I agree.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No; it isn't. Could we say it will be marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 955 and place this sticker on that page, photostat it and\r\nthen just send it back?\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 955 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When Oswald came back on November 3, I believe,\r\nwhich was a regular working day----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Commissioner, he did not come back on November 3. He\r\nmerely wrote a letter.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Wrote a letter. He never came back.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Are all of the employees, Mr. Snyder, Mr.\r\nMcVickar, and the others who had any firsthand contact with the Oswald\r\ncase in this area, were they State Department employees?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir; these two men who were the only ones who did see\r\nhim directly, I think the secretary, their secretary also saw him, but\r\nhad nothing to do with him except as a receptionist. These two men were\r\nForeign Service officers and are now Foreign Service officers.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the strictest term.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes, sir; members of the Foreign Service, appointed by the\r\nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you tell us in a bit more detail the process\r\nthat you followed or the procedure that you carried out when you first\r\ngot into the Oswald case.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned yesterday you got a call or you were directed by I\r\nbelieve the Secretary of State or by somebody in higher authority to\r\ntake certain steps. Will you tell us who called you, what you did in\r\nthe first 3 or 4 days?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It was the evening of the day, perhaps about 5 o'clock\r\non the day of the assassination. It may have been somewhat earlier,\r\nbecause I think I remember I went home for an hour and then came back\r\nto carry out this assignment. Mr. Ball, once it became known that\r\nOswald had some history as a defector----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Ball is the Under Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. He was then the Acting Secretary because the Secretary of\r\nState as you recall was on a plane over the Pacific. So he was the\r\nActing Secretary. But even if he had been the Under Secretary he is my\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He still had some authority.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; he directed me to gather together the files in the\r\nDepartment on Oswald, and to prepare a report to be available for him\r\nthe first thing in the morning covering as best we could within that\r\ntime span the contacts that Oswald had with the Department.\r\n\r\nWe got the passport file. We got the security office file. We got the\r\nspecial consular services file which covered Mrs. Oswald's visa and the\r\nrepatriation loan. I think those three files were the ones that we had.\r\nIt may have been there was a smaller fourth file, but I think those\r\nthree were the ones.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What would that smaller fourth file be?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I can't remember. It was duplicates if it was anything. Oh,\r\nthat is right, we had a visa file and an SCS file so those were the\r\nfour. The SCS file, that is Special Consular Services in the office, in\r\nthe Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You got this order on or about 5 o'clock the 22d\r\nof November?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The 22d; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you issued orders to have these files brought\r\nin, or did you go and get them yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Or what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I issued orders to have them brought in. I called--I am\r\ntrying to think how we got them. [Turning to Mr. Ehrlich.] Did you go\r\ndown and get them? Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. Lowenfeld, another of my people,\r\nwe worked through the night on this, the three of us all together and\r\nit may be that the two of them went down to get them. I don't think we\r\njust called over the telephone and asked them to be brought up.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is my recollection that one of these two gentlemen,\r\neither Mr. Ehrlich or Mr. Lowenfeld acting for me, went down to pick\r\nup the file. Mr. Ehrlich thinks he recalls that one of the files was\r\nalready being examined by the Secret Service or the FBI, the passport\r\nfile. My own recollection, which I am sure of, is that later on in the\r\nevening, about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock, we established contact with the\r\nFBI and they came over and read the files in our office at the same\r\ntime we were reading them. Now actually there was nothing in any of the\r\nfiles that wasn't duplicated in the others in essence. I mean much of\r\nour files consisted of FBI or CIA reports.\r\n\r\nMuch of their files consisted of these letters and documents that you\r\nhave seen that we had come into possession of when Oswald attempted to\r\nrenounce.\r\n\r\nWe worked, as I say, through the night. One thing that we did other\r\nthan go through the files was to go down to the lookout card file to\r\nsee whether there was a lookout card for Oswald. We got Mr. Johnson,\r\nwho is the General Counsel of the Passport Office, to open up the\r\nlookout card file which is a large room that has a combination lock on\r\nthe door, and is also plugged into a general alarm system, got into the\r\nroom and examined the lookout card file and found that there was no\r\ncard for Oswald.\r\n\r\nThis was the first experience I had ever had with the lookout card\r\nfile, and I said all the things that you have said here, why wasn't\r\nthere a card. But we were very careful in doing that to record, Mr.\r\nLowenfeld, Mr. Ehrlich and I and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Schwartz all went\r\nin and we all mutually recorded what steps we took. I think there are\r\nnotes of that, if anybody is interested in them, but I don't think\r\nthere is any need to see them.\r\n\r\nNothing of significance happened. We did find----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask is the passport office under you as Assistant\r\nSecretary and Legal Adviser?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. No, sir; the passport office is under Mr. Schwartz.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Under Mr. Schwartz?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. It is Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And he is directly under the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; he is Assistant Secretary. His chain of command goes\r\nthrough the Deputy Under Secretary for Administration, but he like I\r\nhas the rank of Assistant Secretary and he operates a bureau just as I\r\ndo. The Legal Adviser's office is a separate bureau.\r\n\r\nWe did prepare a 10- or 12-page document by dawn the next day which in\r\nfact is the basis of this report, the Commission Document No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We will give that Commission Exhibit No. 950, your first\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. The one we did overnight?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. No; the one that you sent us. It is Commission Exhibit No.\r\n950. It has been given a number.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if the witness would identify this and verify the\r\ncircumstances under which it was prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. This report, Commission Exhibit No. 950, is not the one\r\nthat we prepared overnight. This is the report we prepared for the\r\nDepartment of Justice before the Commission was appointed when the\r\nDepartment of Justice itself was looking into the matter.\r\n\r\nWhat I say is that Commission Exhibit No. 950 is essentially an\r\nexpansion and elaboration of the document that we prepared that night.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There have been fears expressed by some that\r\nsomehow we don't have before the Commission all of the documents\r\nthat are in the hands of the Department of State or any other agency\r\npertaining to Oswald. You can only testify as to the Department of\r\nState. Do you testify that we have been given everything that was at\r\nany time in the files of Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. To my knowledge that is the case. However, let me say again\r\nwhat I said at the beginning of the testimony. We have constantly and\r\npersistently gone around to all the places in the Department, and that\r\nhas been done under my supervision, and we have made very aggressive\r\nefforts to assure that every office or subdivision of the Department\r\nthat might have documents pertaining to Oswald should give them to the\r\nCommission, through me to the Commission.\r\n\r\nI think there was one stage where perhaps that wasn't understood, but\r\nwe got that corrected. Then later on, as I say, there was the Moscow\r\nEmbassy just sent us a whole load of documents. They said \"We think you\r\nhave got duplicates of all of these so we didn't send them in earlier\"\r\nand it turned out that some of them we didn't have duplicates of. I\r\nnow think--as I say, it is very hard to prove a negative, but we have\r\nmade all the efforts that I think are humanly possible to get these\r\ndocuments out of the files, and I think you have them all, with the\r\nexception of some documents originating in other agencies where by\r\narrangement with the staff they are getting those documents from the\r\noriginating agency.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, at this point could we mark as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 956, a letter from you to Mr. Rankin under date of May\r\n28, 1964, in which you sent us a complete copy of the files, and in\r\nwhich you numbered each one of the files from file I through XII,\r\nand then within each file, each document was numbered and there was\r\nalso indicated the number of pages which would be in each particular\r\ndocument? Will you identify that?\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 956 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; we sent that letter, a copy of which is Commission\r\nExhibit No. 956, in response to the request of the staff in order that\r\nwe would be able exactly to answer this kind of question.\r\n\r\nI should add that I think we sent some additional documents since then,\r\nthose that came back from Moscow in response to our last request.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would next like to mark as Commission Exhibit No. 954,\r\na letter from Mr. Chayes to Mr. Rankin under date of June 4, 1964, in\r\nwhich you sent us the file which you recently received from the Moscow\r\nEmbassy and indicated that that file would be marked file XIII.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 954 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; that is the letter and it contains also the text of\r\nthe Moscow telegram explaining that they thought all the documents they\r\nwere pouching were duplicates.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. With the files you gave us or sent us along with\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 956 and 954, as far as you know you have sent\r\nthe Commission every file which the State Department has, referring to\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were you in general charge, under the Secretary, of\r\nthe correspondence which has been carried on with the Soviet Union\r\ninquiring as to Oswald and to obtain such information as we could from\r\nthe Soviet Union with respect to the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I talked with the Secretary about the Commission's\r\ninterest in making an approach to the Soviet Union, and then he made\r\nthe decision that the Department was willing to proceed with that\r\napproach. I participated in the drafting of the documents, and I\r\nparticipated in the transmissions to the Commission. But the approach\r\nwas made by the Secretary himself, and I did not observe the approach.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that made orally as well as in writing or should we ask\r\nthat of the Secretary of State?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. You can ask it of the Secretary and I think you would get\r\na fuller answer from him, but he did make an oral presentation at the\r\ntime that he handed the note, and the Chief Justice's letter, to the\r\nRussian Ambassador.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In view of your knowledge of this situation, do you think\r\nthat we have got all we can get from the Soviet Union or is there any\r\nother way in which we could get anything additional?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Well, I think probably, the best respondent to that\r\nquestion would also be the Secretary. I think it probably has to be\r\nrecognized that the decision to give what documents were given was a\r\ncarefully considered decision, probably made at very high levels within\r\nthe Soviet Government, and not done lightly or without an examination\r\nof alternatives, and therefore, it seems to me unlikely that one would\r\nbe able to change any such decision.\r\n\r\nBut again I say I am really not the best man to ask that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chayes, just two other documents I would like you to\r\nidentify for the record. One is your letter of May 8, 1964, which has\r\nbeen marked Commission Exhibit No. 948, which answers certain questions\r\ndirected to you by Mr. Rankin, and it is the document that you referred\r\nto several times in your testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; this is my letter, Commission Exhibit No. 948. It\r\ncontains the answers to the questions which were in attachment B to\r\nMr. Rankin's letter, and concern essentially matters within the United\r\nStates and within the State Department here.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Your answers to attachment A were in Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 960. We have already identified that in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; that is correct. There was a delay between the two\r\nletters because attachment A involved questions about activities in\r\nRussia, and some questions about the Soviet Union, and although we\r\nprepared the answers in the first instance in the United States in\r\nthe Department, we wanted to send the replies to the Soviet Union\r\nfor review by our Embassy there. And that accounted for the time\r\ndiscrepancy in the answer to the two attachments.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then in the attachment A we also asked you a question in\r\nreference to a memorandum from Mr. McVickar and you under date of April\r\n24, 1964, sent us Mr. McVickar's memorandum which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 958. But I would like to mark as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 953 your covering letter.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 953 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. Yes; this is my letter. It is dated April 24, 1964, and\r\nit is marked Commission Exhibit No. 953, and it clears up a factual\r\nquestion that was left at large in Mr. McVickar's memorandum.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to offer for\r\nadmission into evidence Commission Exhibits Nos. 948, 950, and 949.\r\nI would also like to note that the attachment to Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 952 was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 958 and has already been\r\nadmitted into evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 948, 950, and 949 were marked for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask this question? Have all of these been previously\r\nidentified in the testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, sir; they have been identified and marked.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Back on the record. That is all the examination I have\r\nof Mr. Chayes. I do want to express my appreciation and thanks for\r\nthe detail in which he gave us information and the method in which he\r\nanswered all the questions.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no further questions. Thank you very much. You have\r\nbeen very full, very frank, very helpful.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I am glad to do what I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BERNICE WATERMAN\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you kindly rise and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you swear the testimony you will give before this Commission is the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you please advise Miss Waterman of the general\r\npurpose of the testimony we will ask of her.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Waterman was with the Department of State until 1962,\r\nat which time she retired. Miss Waterman was the adjudicator in the\r\nOswald case, and she is being called to testify with respect to certain\r\nmemorandums and actions she took in connection with Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\nThese actions dealt with the question whether he had expatriated\r\nhimself, and whether a passport should be reissued to him in 1961. And\r\nalso she has some information concerning the waiver for Marina under\r\n243(g).\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Miss Waterman, I wonder if you would just give us a brief\r\noutline of your experience with the State Department.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I entered the Passport Office in March of 1926,\r\nand I was there until I retired in February 1962, and during that time\r\nI progressed from the position of typist to working on citizenship\r\ncases, and became an adjudicator.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can you hear?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Then I became in charge of a section adjudicating\r\ncitizenship cases from certain places. I continued in citizenship work\r\nuntil I retired.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you proceed, Mr. Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Waterman, I have had marked 25 documents beginning\r\nwith Commission Exhibit No. 957 and going through Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 982, and just before you came in, I showed you a set of those\r\nfiles. Have you had opportunity to review those files?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I did look over the State Department file. I don't\r\nmean State Department files, I mean Passport Office files on Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And I take it that you would agree that every one of the\r\ndocuments I showed you was a document which you prepared, or was a\r\ndocument which was sent to you and you had occasion to read it prior to\r\nthe time I gave it to you today?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now would you tell the Commission the first time, to the\r\nbest of your knowledge, that you heard the name Oswald and in what\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well it was rather seeing it in connection with the----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I call your attention to Commission Document No. 961,\r\nwhich is the second document in the folder I gave you, a telegram dated\r\nNovember 2, 1959.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. The telegram--this is a reply.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; I am talking about the telegram dated November 2,\r\n1959.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I recall from examination of the file that on\r\nNovember 2, 1959, I saw the telegram from the Embassy at Moscow\r\nreporting that Mr. Oswald had called there, and that was sent for\r\nreply. Sent to me for reply.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 910, which is a copy of\r\na telegram from Moscow to the Secretary of State, dated October 31,\r\n1959, and I ask you whether that is the telegram you saw on November\r\nthe 2d?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; this is the telegram, and this is the telegram to\r\nwhich I prepared an interim reply on the same day received, November 2,\r\n1959.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And the reply that you prepared is Commission Exhibit No.\r\n961. That is the telegram of November 2? It is the second document in\r\nthe file before you.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And that telegram indicated that it was prepared----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Miss Waterman's file doesn't have the exhibit numbers on it\r\nso you will have to identify it in some other way.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That telegram shows that it was prepared by you because\r\nyour name appears in the lower left hand corner, is that right?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now below that you indicate \"Clearances EE: SOV: V. James\r\nin substance paraphrased by telephone.\" Will you indicate to the\r\nCommission what that notation means?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. This is a telegram, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, as I recall all telegrams which we dispatch to\r\nEmbassies or offices within the Iron Curtain countries were sent at\r\nleast with the lowest classification, official use only, and we had\r\npreviously received instructions that the telegrams which we prepared\r\non any subjects going to the offices in the Iron Curtain countries\r\nshould be cleared with the desk officers of the appropriate divisions,\r\nthat is EE and so on.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Geographical divisions?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Geographical divisions, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you identify for the record who Miss V. James is?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, Virginia James, an officer in EE.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. EE means?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And SOV?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. SOV, Soviet Division.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. So the Commission Exhibit No. 961, which is a telegram----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Indicates that the telegram was at least communicated to\r\nand cleared by the Soviet desk in Washington before it was sent out?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well yes; I think that one reason that it was always\r\ncleared was that the geographic divisions were particularly interested\r\nin the wording of our replies. I think they just wanted the general\r\nidea of whether or not we were using the proper classification.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And in that telegram of November 2, 1959, you advised\r\nthe Embassy in Moscow that if Oswald insisted on renouncing U.S.\r\ncitizenship, that the statute precludes the Embassy from withholding\r\nhis right to do so regardless of his application pending with the\r\nSoviet Government, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now thereafter did you have anything else to do with the\r\nOswald matter prior to March 1960? To help you, Miss Waterman, March\r\n1960 was the time in which you prepared the refusal card.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes--refusal sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Between sending this telegram on November 2, 1959, and\r\nMarch 1960, did you personally have any knowledge or anything else that\r\nwas going on as far as Oswald was concerned?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, not certainly unless it is in the file. I would\r\nthink that in the meantime we received some kind of further report from\r\nthe Embassy, but I am not----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, we have had marked and put in the record the various\r\nreports that were received, and you say that as all the reports came in\r\nthat you had opportunity to read them?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; of course that isn't too long from the latter part\r\nof 1959 to 1960. Quite often in cases of this nature, the appropriate\r\nEmbassy might submit reports which didn't need replies, just\r\ninformation submitted.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, there was a report submitted by the Embassy on\r\nNovember 2, 1959, which has already been identified as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 908.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And I assume that you received a copy or saw that report?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then on or about March 25, 1960, you had occasion to\r\nprepare a card which has as its head the name or the word \"Refusal.\"\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is not a card. That is a sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is a sheet which is marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n962. Now will you indicate to the Commission the circumstances under\r\nwhich you prepared that card and why you prepared that card?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. This was prepared after the receipt, I believe, of\r\nfurther correspondence from the Embassy, which indicated that Oswald\r\nwas--that it would be possible that he might want to return to the\r\nUnited States. And it was customary to make this red refusal sheet in\r\nour office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What was your office?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. In the adjudication part of the office, to put a flag on\r\nthe case for future reference.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you made the refusal card which has been marked----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Not a card.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Pardon me, refusal sheet----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Refusal sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 962, what would\r\nbe the next step in the system to make sure that Mr. Oswald could\r\nnot use his passport or come back to the United States without the\r\nDepartment having notice?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, in the case of this being a classified file, the\r\nfile would have been returned to the Classified File Section as I\r\nrecall, and there would be a note on there to please index the refusal\r\nsheet, and then if there were any other instructions, for instance,\r\nanother office might want the file or ask for it, if no one wanted it,\r\nwe would ordinarily ask to have the refusal sheet carded and the case\r\nfiled.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. As a result of the preparation of the refusal sheet, would\r\nsomeone else or you have a responsibility to prepare something which is\r\ncalled a lookout card?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. At that time, at least--I don't know what the procedure\r\nis now, I have no idea; at that time, at least, the refusal card as\r\nI call it, or lookout card would have been prepared in the Records\r\nSection of the Passport Office. In other words, a part of the section\r\nwhich handled the files.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you prepared the refusal sheet which is Commission\r\nExhibit No. 962----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I wrote that myself.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you then give--how would the records section know\r\nthat a lookout card should be prepared?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, for one thing the refusal sheet would be placed\r\non top of the file, and I am sure there would be a note to flag the\r\nattention of the records people that a refusal was there to be carded.\r\n\r\nBut in any event, it would be on top of the file, and there would have\r\nbeen nothing on the right hand margin. There would have been no name.\r\nThere would have been nothing put on there in our particular office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In other words, you say----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. In our adjudication part.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Are you saying that Oswald, Lee Harvey, would not have\r\nbeen----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No, no; the sheet was completely blank as to the margin.\r\nAt no time would anything have been entered there, in our adjudication\r\npart.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In Commission Exhibit No. 962, you then say when you\r\nphysically prepared the refusal sheet, the only thing that was prepared\r\nis the typewritten material, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. The typewritten red sheet. If you have the file, it is\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say that after you prepared that, you would physically\r\nplace that red sheet on the top of the passport file, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, now this was placed--I think there was a\r\ncommunication which went out at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You are talking about the Operations Memorandum dated\r\nMarch 28, 1960?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I am talking about the Operations Memorandum, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Which has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 963?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Now that would have gone to file, to the file with this\r\nOperations Memorandum, and the Refusal Sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You prepared the Operations Memorandum also?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; now I see that was mailed 3 days after it was\r\nprepared. In the meantime someone else was looking at it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was it your responsibility actually to see that the\r\nlookout card was prepared?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No; I wouldn't think so, no.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Who would have that responsibility?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, in the first place the cases were examined by\r\nthe records people before being filed, and no one would certainly be\r\nsupposed to file a Refusal Sheet without an indication that he had had\r\na card made.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would the indication that the card was made be put on the\r\nrefusal sheet?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you look at the original of the State Department\r\nrecords?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I am looking at it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Was it put on the refusal sheet?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, it looks to me as if someone started to handle\r\nthis for the refusal card, or lookout card as you call it, because the\r\nname was typed on.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It was written on.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Written on, yes. I believe that to complete that\r\noperation, the designation of the citizenship designation of the\r\nDepartment of State at that time at least, 130, should have been placed\r\non there.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What does 130 mean?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is the Department's classification of citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. By looking at that file, is there anything else that you\r\ncan examine to be able to tell the Commission whether in your judgment\r\nthe actual lookout card was ever prepared?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No; I wouldn't be able to say. I do notice here that the\r\ncase was called for from the files a few days after it went to file,\r\nand that apparently was occasioned by a new communication coming in\r\nfrom our Embassy at Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who called for it, can you tell from that?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Apparently we received--this was called for from--here\r\nis a call slip right here. I am looking at it. Which means that\r\nsomething new had been received and we wanted the file again.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you tell me the number that is on that call sheet?\r\nYou are looking at file X. It is file X she is looking at?\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. X-64.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. X-64.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I might say that in the meantime during the time from\r\nNovember 1959 up into 1960, beginning about early in February 1960, I\r\nwas replaced in this section or branch by an attorney and a member of\r\nthe bar, and at this time I was then the assistant of the section, and\r\nnot the head of it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, was the attorney that replaced you G. W. Masterton?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to ask you to identify Commission Exhibit No.\r\n983.\r\n\r\nIs that a copy of the sheet you referred to, to indicate the file had\r\nbeen called for?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right. A new report had been received and our\r\ncontrol clerk, we call her, our person looking after the records in our\r\nparticular section had made that call slip for the file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is there anything else in the original file which you\r\ncould look at to try to advise us whether you think in your judgment a\r\nlookout card was ever prepared?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I wouldn't be able to know. All I could say is\r\nit is very surprising, because it seems to me that we had--well, I\r\ncould not say how many lookout cards and refusal cards on all kinds\r\nof subjects. And I can only guess that this file was caught up in\r\nsome large number of files that were on hand to have refusal cards or\r\nlookout cards made, or something of that nature, or that the process of\r\nhaving the card made was interrupted by the receipt of the new material\r\nfrom our Embassy at Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. But----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question?\r\n\r\nWho would make out lookout cards in the normal process? Would it be\r\nquite a number of people, or one particular office?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I am not sure about that, Mr. Dulles. That was\r\ncompletely another area, and I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Outside of the Passport Department entirely, was it?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the Passport Department?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Miss Knight could tell us that.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. In the records part of the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nNow, at one time I know that the cards were made in a certain area.\r\nThen I know that later on, and probably prior to this time, we had\r\nbeen requested not to forward any kind of classified files to the\r\nusual place for having these cards made--we should forward them to the\r\nClassified Files Section, which would take it up from there, and give\r\nthem to the proper person to have a card made.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Waterman, it is your testimony that based upon\r\nthe red refusal sheet that you prepared, and also the operations\r\nmemorandums which have been marked respectively Commission Exhibit No.\r\n962 and Commission Exhibit No. 963, that you had done all you were\r\nsupposed to do, and that the file then should have been passed over to\r\nsomebody else, and a lookout card should have been prepared?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes, yes; that was our procedure at that time at least.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, after March 28, 1960, and prior to February 1961,\r\nin that period, did your department, or did you take other actions in\r\nconnection with the Oswald case, with the hope that you would finally\r\nbe able to reach a decision on Oswald, as to whether he had expatriated\r\nhimself or not?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I don't think there was too much going on in the file in\r\n1960.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, I would like to call your attention to----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. But in 1961----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Before we get to 1961, I would like to call your attention\r\nto the memorandum from Mr. White to Mr. Hazelton, dated July 20, 1960,\r\nand the next document, which is a handwritten piece of paper, dated\r\n2-15-61.\r\n\r\nDo you have that? Your number should be X-49.\r\n\r\nI show you the document which is marked in your file X-49, and it has\r\nbeen given Commission Exhibit No. 965.\r\n\r\nNow, is that your handwriting on that document?\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. Might I interject at this time? In looking at the\r\noriginals of these I notice that X-49 is actually two memorandums. They\r\nwere photostated as one, and thus probably you cannot actually read\r\neither one.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, I am referring to the one on top. Is that your\r\nwriting \"took initial action, action\"----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No; that is Mr. Masterton--the memorandum on the little\r\nlarger size below was a memorandum, informal memorandum, which I sent\r\nto my section chief, Mr. Masterton.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you indicate what you said in your memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I said, \"Mr. Masterton, SCS, is writing to mother\r\non welfare aspect of Lee Harvey Oswald. Last two paragraphs of Moscow\r\ndispatch 585, 2-8-61 appeared to be for PPT reply.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that was a letter which had been prepared in SCS--you know\r\nwhat that is.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. And had been forwarded to our office for clearance, for\r\nour initial, before it was mailed, to reply to some inquiry of the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, on top of that memorandum you read, that you\r\nprepared, there is another memorandum, isn't there?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, could you read that into the record?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; \"SCS. Took initial action on action copy, case of\r\nsplit action. Copy our action to go to SCS.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you know or do you have any knowledge what they meant\r\nabout case is split action?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, it has been a long time since I have seen the\r\nmaterial. But I believe that the mother, Mrs. Oswald, in writing to the\r\nDepartment, to the Secretary, probably brought up various questions\r\nabout her son. Now--questions which related to his welfare or physical\r\nrepatriation, or something of that type, which would come under the\r\njurisdiction of the Special Consular Services, should be answered\r\nthere. Any inquiries which were about his citizenship or his passport,\r\nanything that came within the purview of the Passport Office, should\r\nhave a reply drafted by Miss Knight's office, or elsewhere in the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In other words, you are saying that the phrase, split\r\naction, on Commission Exhibit No. 965, doesn't mean that----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. The decision was split; no.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It just means that different offices in the Department\r\nwould have to make different decisions, or take different action?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; and I think that most of Mrs. Oswald's letters were\r\nquite involved, and brought up several questions.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then the next document which I want to ask you questions\r\nabout is your X-55.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 966.\r\n\r\nNow, this letter, though signed by Miss Knight, was prepared by you?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And it was a reply to an inquiry made by Congressman\r\nWright?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. With respect to the Oswald case.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; this was--we probably either received a memorandum\r\nfrom SCS or telephone call, something of that sort.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The next contact you had with the Oswald case was as\r\na result of the Embassy Despatch dated February 28, 1961, which is\r\nX-42(2).\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Are you talking about the Department's Despatch?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; despatch. The Foreign Service Despatch.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; our despatch to the Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I beg your pardon. It is a despatch from the Embassy to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Which we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 967.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When that was received in Washington, you got a copy of\r\nit, did you not?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I think--we seem to have the original in our file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; you saw the document?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And then as a result of seeing the document on March 27,\r\n1961, you prepared a draft of the instruction which should go to Moscow\r\nin response, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And that is in the file as X-46, and we have marked it\r\nas Commission Exhibit No. 968. And the draft that you prepared which\r\nwas attached to Commission Exhibit No. 968 is the next document, which\r\nis X-47, which we have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 969, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. You mean the copy of the----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The proposed State Department instruction.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I see that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And it indicates on the copy that the original was not\r\nsent, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right. Nothing was sent.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can I get this clear now? I am not sure--which was the\r\ndocument that was not sent?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is X-47 (Commission Exhibit No. 969).\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you identify that for the record--because just\r\nreference to documents in our record would be meaningless to the\r\nreader. I think we ought to identify each document as we can, because I\r\nam lost completely.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is Commission Exhibit No. 969, which is a draft of the\r\nState Department instruction to be sent to the Embassy in Moscow, as a\r\nresult of the Embassy's dispatch of February 28.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And this was drafted on March 27, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you, I gather, Miss Waterman, drafted this?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I drafted this, and then apparently we had--everyone had\r\nsecond thoughts on some of the statements in there, and I believe that\r\nit was at this time--wait a minute.\r\n\r\nWe sent this to Miss Knight's office for the special attention of Mr.\r\nHickey.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And is that the memorandum dated March 31, 1961?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Which has been given Commission Exhibit No. 970.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And from that memorandum, you indicate that your proposed\r\ninstructions were that, one, that the passport should be mailed back to\r\nMr. Oswald only under proper safeguards----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Now, are you talking about what wasn't sent or what\r\nfinally was?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The memorandum of March 31, 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; these memorandums were prepared by my superiors. In\r\nother words, this looked a little different and more important by that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, the State Department document No.\r\nX-42 came back to you from higher authority?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No; I prepared the instruction, and I sent it to Mr.\r\nKupiec, who by that time was in charge of our section--Mr. Masterton\r\nhaving been given other duties. And this went into the office of the\r\nChief of our Division, of the Foreign Adjudications Division. And Mr.\r\nCacciatore, who was the Assistant Chief of the Division, drafted a\r\nmemorandum in Mr. White's name to go to Miss Knight's office, and that\r\nis a memorandum of March 31, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, that has been given Commission Exhibit No. 970.\r\n\r\nIt is in your files as X-42.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you had no part in connection with the drafting of\r\nthat memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No, no; our branch had sent the case to our Division\r\nChief, either to comment or authorize the mailing of the instruction\r\nwhich I had prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And then after this memorandum of March 31, 1961, was\r\ndrafted, a decision was finally reached in the Department as to the\r\nform of the State Department instruction which is in your file as X-38?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And we have marked it as Commission Exhibit No. 971.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And that is the instruction that was actually sent to the\r\nEmbassy?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Sent to the Embassy; yes. That was a replacement of\r\nthe instruction which I had originally drafted, and I redrafted that\r\naccording to the dictates of the memorandums which had been exchanged\r\nwith our office and Miss Knight's office.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question here, Mr. Coleman?\r\n\r\nOn the memo of March 31, 1961, Commission Exhibit No. 970, the last\r\nsentence reads as follows: \"For the best interests of the United\r\nStates, therefore, and as the possession of a passport might facilitate\r\nhis obtention of an exit visa it is believed that we should do\r\neverything within our power to facilitate Oswald's entry into the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nWho would have prepared the March 31, 1961 memo that contained that\r\nquotation?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That was prepared by Mr. Cacciatore, who was the\r\nAssistant Chief of the Foreign Operations Division, in which I worked.\r\nAnd Mr. John White was his superior, and Mr. White initialed the memo\r\ngoing to Miss Knight's office, to Mr. Hickey.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who is Mr. Hickey?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Who is he?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I meant at this time what was his position?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I believe at that time his title was--I wouldn't\r\nlike to say definitely--I believe he was the Deputy Chief of the\r\nPassport Office.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Under Miss Knight?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Under Miss Knight, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would like to ask one question about X-38(2).\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is Commission Exhibit No. 971.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is the cable sent--cable of instructions sent on\r\nthe Lee Harvey Oswald matter to the American Embassy in Moscow. This\r\nrelates to----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Now, you are talking about the State Department\r\ninstruction?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is correct. In paragraph 2 there is reference to the\r\ncircumstances under which his passport can be returned, and there is\r\nthis phrase: \"His passport may be delivered to him on a personal basis\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I think it meant deliver it to him in person.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see--deliver it to him in person.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I think those are the words of Mr. Hickey. I\r\nbelieve that somewhere in the file there is a memorandum which Mr.\r\nHickey returned to Mr. White's division, giving his views.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And that may be qualified by the last sentence here,\r\nsuggesting that it would not be wise to send it through the mails?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; in other words, the memorandum which Mr. Hickey\r\nreturned to us, with our proposed instruction, was used as a basis for\r\nour action.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was to be given to him personally, and not transmitted\r\nthrough the mails.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I think that is what it means.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And, also, the State Department instructions were that\r\nhe was to get the passport only after the Embassy had thoroughly\r\nquestioned Oswald regarding the circumstances of his residence in\r\nthe Soviet Union, and his possible commitment of an act or acts of\r\nexpatriation?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Waterman, I note on the side of the State Department\r\ninstruction a notation that CIA furnished copy \"on case by me, 10-5-61.\"\r\n\r\nDo you know who wrote that, and what that means?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I think the person has initialed it who wrote it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Who is CHS?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I think that is Mr. Seeley--Mr. Carroll Seeley.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Carroll H. Seeley, Jr.?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. If that is the way his name is listed in the book.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is he an attorney in the Passport Office?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I don't know what he is now. So far as I know, he was an\r\nattorney at that time. He was in--in the Legal Division of the Passport\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I also note in the next paper which is attached to\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 971 we have marked as Commission Exhibit 972,\r\nthere is a reference sheet----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What is that paper?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is physically attached.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You see, exhibit numbers won't appear----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, it is a reference sheet dated 10-5-61, which\r\nindicates that a Thermofax copy of the Department of State Instruction\r\nNo. A-173, dated April 13, 1961, was sent to the CIA.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I know nothing about that. That is something that was\r\nentirely outside of our Adjudication Division, our Foreign Operations\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. But the reference indicates that it was prepared by Robert\r\nD. Johnson, Chief Counsel, Passport Office, under date of 10-5-61, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I am looking at it. Yes. But that was nothing that\r\nemanated from our part of the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you prepared and had sent forward the Department\r\nof State instruction dated April 13, 1961, you then, on or about May\r\n26, 1961, received the Embassy Foreign Despatch of that date, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And that despatch, which is your No. X-34, has been given\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 973, states that the Embassy had received\r\nanother letter from Oswald, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I am looking at a copy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And also the despatch----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you identify that a little bit?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The despatch is from the Embassy to the Department of\r\nState, and it is Commission Exhibit No. 973, written by Mr. Snyder on\r\nMay 26, 1961, and it indicates, one, that the Embassy has received\r\nanother letter from Mr. Oswald, and it also indicates that Oswald was\r\nmarried to a Russian woman, and it indicates that Oswald has informed\r\nthe Embassy that he had an internal Soviet passport in which he was\r\ndesignated as \"without citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Embassy Despatch actually has as a copy the letter which Mr.\r\nOswald sent to the Embassy in May 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you received that in Washington some time shortly\r\nafter March 26, 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. We received it in our particular office on June 12.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. As a result of receiving----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one second.\r\n\r\nJune----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I am going by our automatic clock stamps on the reverse\r\nof the original.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You received it on June 12?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; we received it in our action office June 12, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. After you received it, you then considered whether the\r\nEmbassy should return to Mr. Oswald his passport. And your decision as\r\nfinally made is reflected in the State Department instruction dated\r\nJuly 11, 1961, which is your X-31, which has been marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 975, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I am looking at a copy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In those instructions, you said that Mr. Oswald could be\r\ngiven his passport, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, yes--because we are in effect agreeing with the\r\nsuggestion of the Embassy. We are telling the Embassy that we----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You are agreeing with their despatch of May 26, 1961,\r\nwhich has been identified for the record as Commission Exhibit No. 973.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. What is this word?\r\n\r\nOh--\"seek.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. What was your question again now?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I am saying what you were agreeing to was the proposed\r\naction of the Embassy as set forth in its Foreign Service Despatch\r\ndated May 26, 1961?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; but I see we also note that the Embassy intended\r\nto contact the Department again before granting any documentation to\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I note on Commission Exhibit No. 975, which is your X-31,\r\nthat on the side there is written \"Pink copy of this sent to EE:SOV\r\nMiss James, BW7-17-61.\"\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I am looking at that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall whether Miss James asked you to send her a\r\ncopy, or did you just send her a copy without being requested?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No; I would not recall, really. We tried to keep--since\r\nthere were many interests involved here, we did try to keep the\r\ngeographic division up to date on what we were doing, so that they\r\nwould have more or less a complete picture of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then I would like to next call your attention to your\r\ndocument which is X-28.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is a memorandum which you prepared, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 978, in which you state that Miss James called and said\r\nthat she wanted to know what reply had you made to the Moscow despatch\r\n29, July 11, 1961, in the case of Oswald. And you stated that the draft\r\nreply was in preparation, and you also said that Miss James said that\r\nthe communication should be cleared with the SOV, and then you make a\r\ncomment that you never heard that the Passport Section's citizenship\r\ndecisions should be routed to SOV for clearance.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Nevertheless, you indicated in the memorandum that you\r\nwould indicate that the SOV had a special interest in the reply to the\r\ndespatch, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you discuss with anybody in the Department Miss James'\r\nrequest?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I don't recall. I don't know. I wouldn't recall\r\nright now.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, is this the only time, to your knowledge, where the\r\nSOV had made a request in connection with a passport?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Oh, no; I would not say that. I don't think so; no. I\r\nthink probably a great many of our communications went out as office\r\nmemoranda, and they received copies of them in the Division anyhow.\r\n\r\nBut I think this was probably more to avoid confusion in having\r\nclassified files be traveling around the different areas of the\r\nDepartment. We could send a copy of an \"OM\" without trouble. But\r\nhanding the files around was another matter. And we didn't put them\r\naround any more than we had to.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The next document in the sheaf of papers I gave you is the\r\nOperations Memorandum dated August 18, 1961, prepared by you----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And we have given it Commission Exhibit No. 979.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In that you indicate that you concur in the conclusion of\r\nthe Embassy that there is available no information and/or evidence to\r\nshow that Mr. Oswald has expatriated himself under the pertinent laws\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you review the entire files which you had in the\r\nPassport Office on Oswald before you wrote this memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; our file was all together.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you also had the benefit of the various Embassy\r\nDespatches which were sent prior to August 18, 1961?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nWell, the part that concerned his citizenship, certainly, was with our\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And reviewing the whole file, you, as the adjudicator,\r\ndetermined on August 18, 1961, that there was nothing in the file which\r\nwould show that Mr. Oswald had expatriated himself?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you say \"no information and/or evidence to\r\nshow that Mr. Oswald\"----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. No information or evidence.\r\n\r\nWell, that is the way I worded it. No information or evidence. We would\r\nhave to have evidence to hold up any action on him. And, in addition to\r\nhaving no evidence, we also had no information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have the information that he had come in\r\nand presented a statement to Mr. Snyder that he wanted to renounce his\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; but he hasn't done so. There was no place that he\r\ncould have done so, except at the Embassy, under a specified form, and\r\nupon specified documents.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you were relying upon the need for\r\nthis particular document?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, in the first place, when he came in--as I believe\r\nMr. Snyder said, or whoever reported from the Embassy--and threw down\r\nhis passport, he apparently was a disgruntled young man--and that\r\nis not the first time a passport has been thrown down on a consular\r\nofficer's desk. And I think that we had--no--in other words, it looked\r\nas if he were already regretting his first action. He was weakening a\r\nlittle bit because he was not being accorded any kind of recognition in\r\nthe Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he was----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But the subsequent evidence, where you say he\r\nwas changing his mind, came about 2 years later. On the other hand,\r\nthere was some evidence, when he first went to the Soviet Union,\r\nOctober 31, 1959, that he at least had an intention to renounce his\r\nAmerican citizenship. He simply had not signed the actual form that is\r\nprescribed by the regulations.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right. He had not.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no indication that actually he intended to do that. He\r\napparently derived some kind of satisfaction from his appearing at the\r\nEmbassy with an ambiguous statement. But there was nothing there to\r\nshow that he actually had an intention of renouncing his citizenship\r\nunder the law.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I must differ with you. That first statement that\r\nhe submitted was not very ambiguous.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I think probably he made several. But, in any\r\nevent--he----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I do think I ought to read what he said on October\r\n31.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I believe I recall that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Here is a letter or a statement in Lee Harvey\r\nOswald's handwriting, which says:\r\n\r\n\"I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my present citizenship in\r\nthe United States of America be revoked.\r\n\r\n\"I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of\r\napplying for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means of\r\nnaturalization.\r\n\r\n\"My request for citizenship is now pending before the Supreme Soviet of\r\nthe U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n\"I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the revoking\r\nof my American citizenship is made only after the longest and most\r\nserious considerations.\r\n\r\n\"I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics.\"\r\n\r\nSigned, \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think that is very ambiguous.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, perhaps not. But the procedure was explained to\r\nhim, and he, as I recall, took no interest in completing any forms to\r\nmake his renunciation of American citizenship official.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The only question that I raise, Miss Waterman, is\r\nin light of this evidence, your statement that there is available no\r\ninformation and/or evidence to show that Mr. Oswald has expatriated\r\nhimself under the pertinent laws of the United States----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I think that is correct. I think the statement is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is a very technical response, or technical\r\nstatement. I think there was evidence that he had placed before\r\nGovernment officials his desire to renounce his citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did anyone advise you or instruct you that you should make\r\nthe adjudication that you made as reflected in the August 18, 1961,\r\nmemorandum, or is this a decision that you made after you had reviewed\r\nthe file?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I made the decision and prepared the communication\r\nwhich went through my superiors, and they apparently agreed with me.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Can you, by looking at the file, particularly the document\r\nmarked X-27, which is the Operations Memorandum dated August 18, 1961,\r\ntell us what superior reviewed the memorandum before it went forth to\r\nthe Embassy?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; the initials there, HFK, are Mr. Kupiec, who was my\r\narea chief, and I believe that up at the top, on the second line of the\r\nOperations Memorandum, opposite \"Department of State\" I believe that\r\nthose were the initials of Mr. White, who was in charge of the Foreign\r\nOperations Division. And then this was also cleared in our Legal\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nNow, that would not be for citizenship purposes, but it would be there\r\nfor reference.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And who was CHS?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is the same person you mentioned awhile ago, Mr.\r\nSeeley.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then as a result of determining that there was no evidence\r\nor information showing that Mr. Oswald had expatriated himself, you\r\nthen indicated that the passport of Mr. Oswald could be renewed, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question here, Mr. Coleman?\r\n\r\nReferring again to the memorandum of August 18, 1961, the first\r\nparagraph, where you say, \"We concur in the conclusion of the Embassy\r\nthat there is available no information and/or evidence to show that Mr.\r\nOswald has expatriated himself under the pertinent laws of the United\r\nStates\"--where is their documentation, if any, that the Embassy has\r\ncome to that conclusion?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Sir, I think she is referring to the despatch of July 11,\r\n1961, which is identified as Commission Exhibit No. 935.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you come to that conclusion based on the total\r\ncontent of the July 11, 1961, memo from the Embassy in Moscow, or\r\nsomething specifically set forth in that memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I think all of the material together. In other\r\nwords, Oswald was not documented as a Soviet citizen. Apparently he\r\ndidn't expect to be. The Embassy had questioned him. And, in addition\r\nto their knowing that during his visits to the Embassy itself he had\r\nnot expatriated himself, they received no information from him in what\r\nquestioning they could do that he had performed any act at all to\r\nexpatriate himself under U.S. laws.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Coleman, do you have that paper we had\r\nyesterday, where the cross-out was present?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, sir; here it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On Commission Exhibit No. 938, Oswald crossed out\r\n\"have not\"----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What is the date of that, Mr. Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is dated----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. July 11, 1961, and it is Oswald's application for renewal\r\nof passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I remember the paper. That is subsequent to this document\r\nhere that we are discussing now.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Done at the same time. The State Department document\r\nshows--I mean the Embassy document shows that one of the covering\r\nmaterial sent to the State Department was the application for renewal\r\nof passport executed by Oswald July 10, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And this was sent with their dispatch of July 11, 1961,\r\nwhich we are now discussing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have that document at the time you wrote\r\nthe statement, \"We concur,\" and so forth?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Which is Commission Exhibit No. 979.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. What is the date?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It is your X-27.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I think we had that. Because we referred to it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, does that statement, the way it is set forth\r\nthere, raise any questions about whether there was any information or\r\nevidence about his expatriation?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. His questionnaire discloses no information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But what about the statement on the first page?\r\n\r\nWill you read it, for the record--the printed part?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; \"I have been naturalized as a citizen of a foreign\r\nstate.\" Well, of course, that would be prepared by the Embassy. I think\r\nthey just crossed out the wrong one.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But all we can go by is what we see.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you examine the original in the State Department\r\nfile, and see what was crossed out there?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes--\"I have not.\" I think that was an Embassy error.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is a fairly important error, though.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you read the full text of what is shown there\r\nas it is shown on the original?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. \"I have been naturalized as a citizen of a foreign\r\nstate; taken an oath or made an affirmation or other formal declaration\r\nof allegiance to a foreign state; entered or served in the armed forces\r\nof a foreign state; accepted, served in or performed the duties of any\r\noffice, post or employment under the government of a foreign state,\r\nor political subdivision thereof; voted in a political election in a\r\nforeign state or participated in an election or plebiscite to determine\r\nthe sovereignty over foreign territory; made a formal renunciation\r\nof nationality, either in the United States or before a diplomatic\r\nor consular officer of the United States in a foreign state; been\r\nconvicted by court martial of deserting the military, air or naval\r\nservice of the United States in time of war; or of committing any act\r\nof treason against or of attempting by force to overthrow or of bearing\r\narms against the United States; or departed from or remained outside\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States for the purpose of evading or\r\navoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of\r\nthe United States. If any of the above mentioned acts or conditions are\r\napplicable in the applicant's case, or to the case of any other person\r\nincluded in this application, a supplementary statement under oath\r\nshould be attached and made a part hereof.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is signed by Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is signed by Lee Harvey Oswald. And his statement\r\nhere indicates and shows the performance of no such act as is described\r\non the first page of the application.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Any one of those conditions, however, in that\r\nstatement would indicate that he had renounced his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. It could. But, in other words, he now says----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He says some place in there he is without\r\nnationality. Did you have that at the time----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. \"I am described as being without citizenship.\" That is\r\nright. In other words, it is questionable whether the Embassy should\r\nhave crossed out \"have not.\" In other words, he might have said I have\r\ndone this, but his explanation----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is what the document shows.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. But his explanation clearly shows that he had not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether that was noted at the time, or deemed\r\nto be a clerical error, or how did you interpret that crossing out of\r\nthat particular line there?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, in any event--I actually cannot recall, Mr.\r\nDulles. But the questionnaire, which was also under oath, at the\r\nEmbassy, would be the material part here. And there is no information\r\nin here to show that he had been naturalized. He said he was not known\r\nas a Soviet citizen, he did not have a Soviet passport. And as for the\r\nother items of possible expatriation, I don't see how they could have\r\napplied to him, in any event.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Coleman, I suggest that, to make the record\r\ncomplete as to what the evidence was in the file, that we have\r\nreprinted in the record at this point Commission Exhibit No. 912,\r\nbecause it was a followup statement by Oswald on the status as he saw\r\nit of his citizenship at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You want the reporter to print physically in the record\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 912 and 913, the two Oswald letters?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one question. I note here this is typed out. The line\r\nI saw had been marked out. I think it is a fair inference that this was\r\ntyped out, since the typing was probably done in the American Embassy.\r\nHe had no typewriter. There is a fair inference that might have been a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All we can go by is what the record shows.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think we ought to clarify that through the record in\r\nMoscow, because the record is not good at this point.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. There is another copy, as you know, that came in from the\r\nEmbassy that we sent to you that showed in fact--it was not a carbon,\r\nit was a separate one, in which the \"have\" was----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That is Commission Exhibit No. 947.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. That was in the Embassy. It was not in the Department.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There the \"X's\" were above everything, but probably were\r\nintended to mark out the \"have.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is Commission Exhibit No. 938 the original?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is a photostat of the original?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. The original is in the Department's file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Congressman Ford, the original document is right\r\nphysically in front of you.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That one is crossing out his \"have not.\" It is\r\nvery clear.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And on this one, which is the copy in the Embassy files,\r\nthe crossed out is above all three. It apparently was intended to be\r\ncrossed out, the \"have.\"\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We just thought the record should--you recall we asked Mr.\r\nSnyder a question about this, and he said he didn't know whether it was\r\na typographical error, or just what the reason for it was.\r\n\r\nMiss Waterman, would you be kind enough to look at the document in your\r\nfile which is X-30, and could you look at the original, in the original\r\nState Department file?\r\n\r\nNow, we have marked it as Commission Exhibit No. 977.\r\n\r\nNow, the second page of the document that we have has inserted a\r\nsheet of paper called a passport office lookout file. Is that stamped\r\nphysically on the back of the first page?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That indicates that the document was received on July 19,\r\nis that correct? There is a stamp on there?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; July 19.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. There is another stamp on there, August 3, 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I see that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You also have the lookout file on the Passport Office, is\r\nchecked under \"No Lookout (refusal) File Record.\"\r\n\r\nDo you see that?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I see it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Does this mean that when someone ordered a search of the\r\nlookout record file in July or August, 1961, that there was no lookout\r\nfile record on Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Apparently so. That was probably done automatically. The\r\nrecords people probably did that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. This was prior to the time when you had made your decision\r\nthere had been no expatriation, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I will have to look at this.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Your recommendation wasn't made until August 18, 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is what we were replying to. That is one of the\r\ncommunications that we were acknowledging, yes, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, should there have been a lookout card when the\r\nsearch was made in July 1961, on Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, I would say that if one were made, it would have\r\nbeen in there.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't know that I always would have examined the reverse of\r\nevery dispatch. If I had examined the reverse of that despatch, I\r\nprobably would have noted it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, what I am saying, as a result of the refusal sheet\r\nthat you prepared in 1960, when the lookout section made the search on\r\nAugust 3, 1961, should there not have been a lookout file at that time\r\non Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Are you talking about a lookout card?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. A lookout card, yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. A lookout card would only have referred to this file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Which we already had, and which we already determined\r\nhad no evidence of expatriation.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I am suggesting that you did not make that determination\r\nuntil August 18, 1961.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, Mr. Coleman, the card itself would have been\r\ntotally immaterial to the decision we made here, inasmuch as we had the\r\nentire file, and also our refusal--the refusal sheet would be in here.\r\n\r\nAs I said, that was not for expatriation. It was just to flag an\r\nadverse--possible adverse interest in the case.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But there has been testimony given here before, Miss\r\nWaterman, that when the question came up later of the issuance of a\r\npassport, since there was no lookout card, this file was not consulted.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, that could be. That was, I believe--I believe that\r\nwas after I had anything to do with the file.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; I know. You cannot testify as to that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, Miss Waterman, would you be kind enough to turn over\r\nto the next document which you have before you, after the August 18,\r\n1961, memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And that is in the file--your file as 1X-24. It has been\r\ngiven Commission Exhibit No. 980.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And will you note that there is some typewritten material\r\nthat appears on the first page which says, \"Attached report is a\r\nsummation of Subject's background and case since he renounced U.S.\r\ncitizenship and sought Soviet citizenship in the fall of 1959. As his\r\ncitizenship status does not appear to be resolved, copies of the report\r\nare furnished to both PPT and VO.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the attachment is an FBI report.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Written on the side in your handwriting, I assume, is the\r\nword \"incorrect.\"\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you recall when you wrote that on that paper?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, probably when I saw it. I would not recall when I\r\nwrote it, but it would be--the statement--my inference there that the\r\nstatement in this memorandum is what you might call a misnomer would\r\nhave been correct at any date.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who wrote this memorandum which you indicated was incorrect?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I have a line there \"renounced U.S. citizenship.\" In\r\nother words, somebody who had nothing to do with the adjudication\r\nof the case or citizenship had made a statement in there that this\r\nperson had renounced, and that is a rather poor thing to have in the\r\nfile which is going around to various places in the Department or\r\npossibly elsewhere. And I did write that on, with reference only to his\r\nrenunciation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. With reference to that one statement?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And then on December 28, 1961, you drafted a memorandum\r\nwhich purports to be from Miss Knight to Robert F. Hale, in which you\r\nindicated that any inference in the memorandum of July 27, 1961, which\r\nis the document I have just asked you about----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That Oswald was not a citizen of the United States is\r\nincorrect.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you prepared----\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. In other words, this memorandum which I did make the\r\nnotation on was sent to other parts of the Department, and we wanted to\r\ncorrect that impression, that there was any evidence of expatriation by\r\nOswald, by renunciation of U.S. citizenship, or any other way.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 981, which\r\nis the memorandum of December 28, 1961, in which you made the statement\r\nthat any inference that Mr. Oswald had--was not a citizen of the United\r\nStates was incorrect.\r\n\r\nMr. WATERMAN. Well, yes; well, that is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Then on the same day you drafted an operations memorandum\r\nto be sent to the Embassy in Moscow in which you said that the Passport\r\nOffice approves the manner of the Embassy's replies to Mr. Oswald with\r\nrespect to passport facilities for him in the future. Is that correct?\r\nThat you drafted that memorandum?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Yes; I drafted that.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That has been given Commission Exhibit No. 982.\r\n\r\nThat is December 28, 1961. It is the last document.\r\n\r\nNow, after December 28, 1961, did you have anything else to do as far\r\nas the Oswald matter was concerned?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I don't think so, except perhaps sending a copy of some\r\ndocument or letter to our files--because I had only about a month's\r\nwork in the Department. I left work on February 2, 1962, and that was\r\nthe last day I had with any kind of performance of duties.\r\n\r\nI might have marked some paper or something of that sort.\r\n\r\nBut I don't recall any action. If the file shows it, I took it. But,\r\notherwise, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. When you took the various actions we have discussed this\r\nmorning with respect to Mr. Oswald, were you acting under instructions\r\nof anyone that this was the decision you would have to make because\r\nsomeone else in the Department wanted you to resolve the question this\r\nway?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nDo you mean outside of the Passport Office?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Outside the Passport Office?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; I am just asking you for the record.\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. I know. But you mentioned--such as who?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did anyone call you up and say, \"Miss Waterman, this is\r\nthe way you have to resolve this case\"?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Oh, no. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And you made the decisions you made based upon the record\r\nand your judgment as to what you thought the law was and what the facts\r\nwere?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you consult anyone in connection with reaching that\r\ndecision in the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Well, Mr. Dulles, in preparing this correspondence, as\r\nI have told you, the correspondence was prepared for the signature of\r\nmy superiors, and if they didn't agree with what I wrote, that was all\r\nright with me. But that was my impression, and I believed there had\r\nbeen discussion among persons in our immediate office. And while----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Your decision, then, is not final. It is subject to review\r\nby your superiors in matters of this kind?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nBut in no event--I don't know of any--as I say, my connection with the\r\ncase closed, and I never heard in the press or any other place that\r\nindicated that Oswald expatriated himself and that he wasn't entitled\r\nto a passport.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Your decision wasn't in any way influenced by the fact\r\nthat Miss James told you that this was a decision that would have to be\r\nmade or anything like that?\r\n\r\nMiss WATERMAN. Certainly not. They have absolutely nothing to do with\r\ncitizenship--nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, before we close the testimony of Miss\r\nWaterman, I would like to move for the admission of Commission Exhibits\r\nNo. 957 through Commission Exhibit No. 983, which were the documents\r\nthat we marked.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 957-983, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to thank Miss Waterman for coming in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We thank you very much, Miss Waterman.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE HON. DEAN RUSK, SECRETARY OF STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 3:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary Dean Rusk, we wanted to ask you a few\r\nquestions about this matter in any particular detail you wanted to\r\nanswer. Mr. Rankin would you inform the Secretary the areas we intend\r\nto cover before we ask the questions.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I think the particular area that we\r\nwould be interested in with the Secretary is just as to whether, or his\r\nknowledge of whether there was any foreign political interest in the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nWe have been getting the information in regard to other matters\r\nconcerning the State Department from other of his associates and\r\ncolleagues and employees of the Department, and we are going to\r\ncomplete that and it has been helpful to us and I think we can rather\r\nlimit the inquiry to that area.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; very well.\r\n\r\nMr. Secretary, would you rise and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly\r\nswear the testimony you are about to give before this Commission shall\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please, and Mr. Rankin will ask you\r\nthe questions, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask one question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I would like to be just as helpful as possible to\r\nthe Commission. I am not quite clear of testimony in terms of future\r\npublication. There may be certain points that arise where it might\r\nbe helpful to the Commission for me to comment on certain points but\r\nthere--it would be a very grave difficulty about publication, so I\r\nwonder what the Commission's view on that is.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Mr. Secretary, our purpose is to have available\r\nfor the public all of the evidence that is given here. If there is any\r\nphase of it that you think might jeopardize the security of the Nation,\r\nhave no hesitation in asking us to go off the record for a moment, and\r\nyou can tell us what you wish.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Thank you, sir, I am at your disposal.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Chief Justice, could I make a suggestion in that\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would it be feasible to have a discussion here of the\r\npoints that are vital from the point of view of our record, and so\r\nforth, and maybe a little informal conversation afterward to cover the\r\nother points.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will have a recess for a few moments then.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I thought between the two wouldn't that be easier than put\r\nthe two together.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, will you give us your name and address,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Dean Rusk, 4980 Quebec Street, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are the Secretary of State for the United States?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have occupied that position for some time?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Since January 22, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In that position you have become familiar with our foreign\r\nrelations and the attitude and interest in some degree of other\r\ncountries that we deal with?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; within the limitations of the possibilities, it is\r\nat least my task to be as familiar as possible with those things.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In your opinion, was there any substantial interest or\r\ninterests of the Soviet Union which would have been advanced by the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I would first have to say on a question of that sort\r\nthat it is important to follow the evidence. It is very difficult to\r\nlook into the minds of someone else, and know what is in someone else's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI have seen no evidence that would indicate to me that the Soviet Union\r\nconsidered that it had an interest in the removal of President Kennedy\r\nor that it was in any way involved in the removal of President Kennedy.\r\nIf I may elaborate just a moment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you will, please.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. As the Commission may remember, I was with several\r\ncolleagues in a plane on the way to Japan at the time the assassination\r\noccurred. When we got the news we immediately turned back. After my\r\nmind was able to grasp the fact that this event had in fact occurred,\r\nwhich was the first necessity, and not an easy one, I then, on the\r\nplane, began to go over the dozens and dozens of implications and\r\nramifications of this event as it affects our foreign relations all\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\nI landed briefly in Hawaii on the way back to Washington, and gave some\r\ninstructions to the Department about a number of these matters, and\r\nlearned what the Department was already doing. But one of the great\r\nquestions in my mind at that time was just that question, could some\r\nforeign government somehow be involved in such an episode.\r\n\r\nI realized that were this so this would raise the gravest issues of\r\nwar and peace, but that nevertheless it was important to try to get at\r\nthe truth--to the answer to that question--wherever that truth might\r\nlead; and so when I got back to Washington I put myself immediately in\r\ntouch with the processes of inquiry on that point, and as Secretary of\r\nState had the deepest possible interest in what the truthful answer to\r\nthose questions would be, because it would be hard to think of anything\r\nmore pregnant for our foreign relations than the correct answer to that\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI have not seen or heard of any scrap of evidence indicating that the\r\nSoviet Union had any desire to eliminate President Kennedy nor in any\r\nway participated in any such event.\r\n\r\nNow, standing back and trying to look at that question objectively\r\ndespite the ideological differences between our two great systems, I\r\ncan't see how it could be to the interest of the Soviet Union to make\r\nany such effort.\r\n\r\nSince I have become Secretary of State I have seen no evidence of any\r\npolicy of assassination of leaders of the free world on the part of the\r\nSoviets, and our intelligence community has not been able to furnish\r\nany evidence pointing in that direction.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I would have known about such bits of evidence had they\r\nexisted but I also made inquiry myself to see whether there was such\r\nevidence, and received a negative reply.\r\n\r\nI do think that the Soviet Union, again objectively considered,\r\nhas an interest in the correctness of state relations. This would\r\nbe particularly true among the great powers, with which the major\r\ninterests of the Soviet Union are directly engaged.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you expand on that a little bit so that others than\r\nthose who deal in that area might understand fully what you mean?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; I think that although there are grave differences\r\nbetween the Communist world and the free world, between the Soviet\r\nUnion and other major powers, that even from their point of view there\r\nneeds to be some shape and form to international relations, that it\r\nis not in their interest to have this world structure dissolve into\r\ncomplete anarchy, that great states and particularly nuclear powers\r\nhave to be in a position to deal with each other, to transact business\r\nwith each other, to try to meet problems with each other, and that\r\nrequires the maintenance of correct relations and access to the\r\nleadership on all sides.\r\n\r\nI think also that although there had been grave differences between\r\nChairman Khrushchev and President Kennedy, I think there were evidences\r\nof a certain mutual respect that had developed over some of the\r\nexperiences, both good and bad, through which these two men had lived.\r\n\r\nI think both of them were aware of the fact that any Chairman of the\r\nSoviet Union and any President of the United States necessarily bear\r\nsomewhat special responsibility for the general peace of the world.\r\n\r\nIndeed without exaggeration, one could almost say the existence of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere in this nuclear age.\r\n\r\nSo that it would be an act of rashness and madness for Soviet leaders\r\nto undertake such an action as an active policy. Because everything\r\nwould have been put in jeopardy or at stake in connection with such an\r\nact.\r\n\r\nIt has not been our impression that madness has characterized the\r\nactions of the Soviet leadership in recent years.\r\n\r\nI think also that it is relevant that people behind the Iron Curtain,\r\nincluding people in the Soviet Union and including officials in the\r\nSoviet Union, seemed to be deeply affected by the death of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nTheir reactions were prompt, and I think genuine, of regret and sorrow.\r\nMr. Khrushchev was the first to come to the Embassy to sign the book of\r\ncondolences. There were tears in the streets of Moscow. Moscow Radio\r\nspent a great deal of attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nNow they did come to premature conclusions, in my judgment, about\r\nwhat this event was and what it meant in terms of who might have been\r\nresponsible for it--and ideological effect has crept into that.\r\n\r\nBut I had the impression that the regret was genuine and that the\r\nordinary Soviet citizen joined with ordinary people in other parts of\r\nthe world in feeling the loss of the President in a very genuine sense.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There has been some suggestion that possibly the leadership\r\nof the Soviet Union would not have been politically interested in the\r\ndeath of the President but possibly a distant wing of the Party might\r\nhave been so involved.\r\n\r\nCan you give us any light on that, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. By suggestion you mean rumor?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In the newspapers, and things of that kind, rumor.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I haven't been able to put a rational structure behind\r\nthat possibility. If there are dissident elements their primary problem\r\nis within the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIf these dissident elements were aiming to change the present\r\nGovernment of the Soviet Union or its leadership or to return to an\r\nearly range of policy by the elimination of present leadership or\r\nseizure of control, I don't quite see how the elimination of the\r\nPresident of the United States could contribute to that purpose.\r\n\r\nI would also suppose that in their kind of system such elements would\r\nbe under pretty close supervision and surveillance and they would have\r\nlimited opportunities for the kind of action that would be organized in\r\na way in this direction, although that is a matter of some speculation.\r\n\r\nBut, I would doubt very much that such dissident elements would have a\r\nmotive or very much of an opportunity. Again, I have seen no evidence\r\npointing in that direction.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How could you tell us in regard to Cuba in the same general\r\nway, your opinion and knowledge of any information or credible evidence?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Well, I would again repeat that the overriding\r\nconsideration is to make every possible effort to find evidence and\r\nfollow the evidence to wherever it leads.\r\n\r\nI think it is, at least for me, more difficult to try to enter into\r\nthe minds of the present leadership in Cuba than, perhaps, even of the\r\npresent leadership of the Soviet Union. We have had very few contacts,\r\nas the Commission knows, with the present Government of Cuba.\r\n\r\nBut again, I have seen no evidence that seems to point in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThere were some exchanges, with which the Commission is familiar,\r\nthat seemed to be--seemed to come to another conclusion. But I would\r\nthink that objective considerations would mean that it would be even\r\ngreater madness for Castro or his government to be involved in any such\r\nenterprise than almost for anyone else, because literally the issue of\r\nwar and peace would mean the issue of the existence of his regime and\r\nperhaps of his country might have been involved in that question.\r\n\r\nWe were under the impression that there was very considerable concern\r\nin Cuba as to whether they would be held responsible and what the\r\neffect of that might be on their own position and their own safety.\r\n\r\nBut I have seen no evidence that points to involvement by them, and\r\nI don't see objective facts which would seem to make it in their\r\ninterests to remove Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nYou see, this embarks upon, in any event it would embark upon, an\r\nunpredictable trail for them to go down this path, but I would think\r\nagain the Commission would wish to examine the evidence as it has been\r\ndoing with meticulous care and follow the evidence in these matters.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After the assassination, did you have direct communications\r\nwith Ambassador Thomas Mann while he was still Ambassador at Mexico?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; we had a number of exchanges with Ambassador Mann\r\nconnected with the presence in Mexico of Mr. Oswald.\r\n\r\nI say those messages, and over a period of some days had daily\r\nconsultations about them with our Deputy Under Secretary for\r\nPolitical Affairs, Mr. U. Alexis Johnson. Mr. Johnson is my principal\r\nrepresentative in our dealings with the various intelligence and\r\nsecurity agencies of the government and with the Pentagon, and he has\r\nan office very near mine on the seventh floor of the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThese exchanges raised questions of the most far-reaching character\r\ninvolving the possibility of the implications of another government,\r\nand so I had a very deep personal interest in that at the time.\r\n\r\nOur principal concern was to be sure that the FBI and the CIA who were\r\nthe principal agencies investigating this matter would have every\r\npossible facility at their disposal, and would--and that our Ambassador\r\nwould be given the fullest support from us in facilitating the\r\ninvestigation at the Mexican end.\r\n\r\nSo I was for a period, until this particular trail ran its course, very\r\nmuch involved in those exchanges.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any commentary that you want to make about\r\nthose exchanges other than what you have given us?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I think not, sir. I think that the materials, the\r\ninformation developed in those exchanges are before the Commission, and\r\nI believe the Commission has had a chance to inquire into them both as\r\nI understand both here and in Mexico with the appropriate agencies and\r\nI would think that the Commission's conclusions on that would be more\r\nvaluable than mine because I have not put together all the pieces to\r\ndraw finished conclusions from them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. One of the Commissioners saw a newspaper story shortly\r\nafter the assassination saying \"The Voice of America beaming its\r\nmessage into Russia immediately blamed the reactionary rightwing\r\nmovements after Kennedy's death.\"\r\n\r\nDo you know anything about that matter or what the source of it might\r\nhave been?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. No; I have not anticipated that question so that I\r\ncould have a chance to investigate it, but I will, if I may, Mr. Chief\r\nJustice, file a report with the Commission on that point.\r\n\r\nI can say now that there was never any policy guidance from the\r\nDepartment of State or from the leadership of the Voice of America\r\nsuggesting that any broadcasters take that line.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, and this is purely speculative at the moment, that\r\nthe Voice of America in repeating a great many news accounts, as it\r\nfrequently does in its overseas broadcasts, may have repeated some\r\nnews accounts from this country, among which might have been a story\r\nto that effect from one source or another, but I would like if I may,\r\nsir, an opportunity to investigate that point and make a report to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may do that, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question? Have we received in the\r\nCommission all of the Voice of America broadcasts that were made over a\r\nperiod of 2 to 7 days involved in this incident?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I don't know of any.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think the Commission ought to have them for our\r\nown analysis as well as the analysis of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that under your jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; indeed I could provide that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you will, please.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. The Commission might also be interested in either\r\ndigests or the fuller materials on world reactions to the President's\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nI have here, for example, a daily summary of the 26th of November\r\n1963, on foreign radio and press reaction which gives some interesting\r\ntreatment about this behind the Iron Curtain.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to furnish the Commission with any material of that\r\nsort which you might wish.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We would appreciate having that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well, thank you, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would that include the Voice of Moscow or whatever\r\nthey call it over there?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From the outset of the events that took place?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes, sir; you might just wish to look at the first two\r\nor three paragraphs here to get a sample of the kind of summary that\r\nthat involves.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that prepared in the Department or by the Foreign\r\nBroadcast Information Service?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. This particular one is from the Foreign Broadcast\r\nInformation Service. We also have another one. We also have another one\r\nfrom within the Department which is also available in terms.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be useful to have both for a\r\nperiod of about a week or so. I realize this is a summary covering\r\nseveral days. I think I saw that at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. There was another statement in the paper apparently\r\npurporting to be official that one of the Commissioners asked me to\r\nask about and that was the Washington Post, Sunday, November 24, 1963,\r\nwhich was quoted by the Commissioner as, \"Today in Washington State\r\nDepartment officials said they have no evidence indicating involvement\r\nof any foreign power in the assassination.\"\r\n\r\nDo you know anything about that or can you give us any information?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. That was the view which we took at the time in\r\nconsultation with the investigative agencies. We did not then have\r\nevidence of that sort nor do we now, and the implications of suggesting\r\nevidence in the absence of evidence would have been enormous.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I don't understand that.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Well, for us to leave the impression that we had\r\nevidence that we could not describe or discuss, when in fact we didn't\r\nhave the evidence on a matter of such overriding importance could have\r\ncreated a very dangerous situation in terms of----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Wouldn't it have been just as effective to say no\r\ncomment?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Well, unfortunately, under the practices of the press,\r\nno comment would have been taken to confirm that there was evidence. I\r\nmean, that would have been the interpretation that many would have put\r\nupon no comment.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. Ford, I think the key thing is that at the time that statement\r\nwas made we did not have such evidence. I mean, this was a factual\r\nstatement at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But, at that time, this was 2 days after the\r\nassassination, you really didn't have much time to evaluate all of the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Well, that is correct. But if the evidence or the known\r\nfacts had changed certainly that type of statement would have changed.\r\n\r\nIn other words, such statements are based upon the situation as known\r\nat the time the statements are made.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This statement then appeared in the Sunday\r\nmorning, November 24 issue or edition of the Washington Post. That was\r\na statement issued certainly on the 23d of November because it had to\r\nbe in order to get in the Sunday edition of the Post. So, that is 24\r\nhours after the assassination.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. That is correct, sir, and this statement was made on\r\nthe basis of such information as was available to us in the first 24\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I was also asked to inquire whether that was an official\r\nstatement if under your responsibility or if you could tell me who\r\nwould be responsible for it?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Well, I would have to check the actual source of the\r\nstatement. But I would have no present doubt that it was an officer of\r\nthe Department who was authorized to make that and for which I would be\r\nfully responsible.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question in connection with that?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There was some evidence presented here quite recently when\r\nthe district attorney of Dallas was here with regard to a message\r\nfrom Washington, from the White House to the attorney general of\r\nTexas, who was also here the other day before the Commission, on this\r\npoint: A rumor had reached Washington that in preparing the indictment\r\nthere, they were going to put in some reference to an international\r\nconspiracy. As a matter of fact, when that was run down it was not\r\na correct rumor. But when that reached Washington, the reaction was\r\nrather strong and I think entirely understandable, and word went\r\nback to Dallas from high quarters that that should not, hoped that\r\nthat would not be included in the legal proceedings and papers that\r\nwere filed in connection with the assassination of the President and\r\ncharging----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Unless there was evidence to support it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Unless there was evidence to support it. And the district\r\nattorney, who was here, testified that he had never considered adding\r\nthat into it, putting that in the proceedings because if you put it in\r\nyou had to prove it, and it is not necessary at all. All you need to do\r\nis allege a murder with intent, and so forth, and so on. So that that\r\nwas all pretty well cleared up.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did that ever reach your attention, did you know anything\r\nabout that?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I don't personally recall that particular message. I do\r\nrecall----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That took place, I think before you got back, because that\r\ntook place on the evening of the 22d.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I didn't arrive until----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't get back until the 23d?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Until the early morning of the 23d.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I do recall being concerned if several different\r\nauthorities and agencies undertook investigations that would cut across\r\neach other's bow or make it difficult to elicit the cooperation of\r\npeople outside the United States whose cooperation we might need in\r\nmatters of that sort, I felt myself at that time there ought to be a\r\ncomplete and absolutely thorough investigation by the most responsible\r\nauthorities and I was glad to see that brought into some order at the\r\ntime but I don't remember the particular message you are talking about.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you check to see if somebody in the\r\nDepartment of State made such a call or made such a contact?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; I will be be glad to.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And if so so report it for the proceedings?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes, indeed; I will be glad to.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I may be able to supply some information to the Commission\r\non this point because during the night of the 22d when we were\r\nexamining the data in my office, the files, I did receive a call from\r\nMr. Katzenbach who said that they had heard at the Justice Department,\r\nthat there was a possibility that this kind of an element would get\r\ninto the indictment, and said that--I can't remember the exact words\r\nthat he used--but he conveyed to me that he regarded this as not very\r\ngood, in the absence of evidence to support it, and said that he was\r\nseeking to have Mr. Saunders, who is the U.S. attorney in Dallas,\r\nadmitted to the councils of the State officials there so that they\r\ncould discuss these matters as time went on. And that he would try to,\r\nI don't know exactly again what he said, but that he would try to see\r\nthat in the absence of evidence no such allegation was made in the\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nI didn't in any sense authorize, and I certainly couldn't direct him\r\nto do anything of this kind but my recollection of my reaction is\r\nthat I acquiesced fully in what he was proposing to do, and raised no\r\nobjection to it.\r\n\r\nI think at sometime during that evening I reported this conversation to\r\nMr. Ball. I am less clear about this part of the recollection, but I\r\nthink I did report the conversation to Mr. Ball, much in the same way\r\nas I am reporting it to you, and he saw no objection either.\r\n\r\nI think that is the entire State Department side of that particular\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you check, however, Mr. Secretary, to see if\r\nthere is anything further in this regard?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; I will.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do I understand that you or somebody for you is\r\nto summarize the USIA Voice of America broadcast that went out for the\r\nfirst 3 or 4 days subsequent to the assassination and that would be\r\nsubmitted for the record?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes, indeed. And we can, of course, have available\r\nto the Commission such tapes or transcripts as we have of all those\r\nbroadcasts in full, but I think we can start with the summary and then\r\nyou can have the other materials if you wish to follow up particular\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would they be voluminous, the originals?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I would think they would be fairly voluminous, but not\r\nunmanageably so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I would say for at least the first 24 hours it\r\nmight be well to have the full text of the USIA Voice of America\r\nmaterial that was sent out.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do I also understand for the record that we are\r\nto have this or others like it showing what the press reaction was\r\nthroughout the world?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service material would be much\r\nmore voluminous because there we are receiving broadcasts in the clear\r\nfrom most broadcasting countries. But we will be in touch with your\r\nstaff to show them everything that we have, and they can have any\r\npart of it they wish or we will be glad to give any help in terms of\r\ndigesting or summarizing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We have been furnished some information, considerable\r\ninformation, about the attitude of the foreign press as it was recited\r\nand has come to the attention of the people from time to time, but I\r\ndon't believe we have right close, the Voice of America we don't have\r\nright close to the date of the assassination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I read a sizable file on that that came from the State\r\nDepartment and very early in the life of the Commission that seemed to\r\nencompass all of the statements that were made around the world at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This document which you handed me, Mr. Secretary,\r\nis for Tuesday, 26 November 1963. Are these done on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I think that one was a summary of the first 2 or 3\r\ndays, but I would----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Summaries are done from time to time and there are daily\r\nreports from Foreign Broadcasting Information Service covering the\r\nSoviet Union and the satellites and another volume covering China and\r\nsoutheast Asia, and so forth and so on.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, could you give us a brief description of\r\nthat, we have been calling it this and these.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; this is a daily report or rather a supplement to\r\nthe daily report put out by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service\r\nin what is called its world reaction series.\r\n\r\nThis apparently is a supplement to the foreign radio and press reaction\r\nto the death of President Kennedy, and the accession of President\r\nJohnson, prepared on 26 November 1963.\r\n\r\nThis is a daily report, the subject matter of which varies from day\r\nto day, but I will be glad to draw together not only such digests as\r\nwe have, but also to see what we have retained in terms of the actual\r\nbroadcasts from other countries so that although it may be voluminous\r\nit might have some material of interest to the Commission or its staff.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be particularly pertinent as far\r\nas the Soviet Union or any of the bloc countries or Cuba, anything in\r\nthis area that could be pulled together and included in the record,\r\nwhich I think would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I have the recollection that some people have\r\nalleged that Castro either prior to or subsequent to the assassination,\r\nmade some very inflamatory speech involving President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDo you have any recollection of that?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I don't have a recollection of a speech specially\r\nrelated to time. He has made more than his share of inflamatory\r\nspeeches about this country and its leaders. But I will be glad to\r\nfurnish the Commission a schedule of his speeches, and the character of\r\nthese speeches and the texts if we have them during this period.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was one that I vaguely recall, either prior\r\nto or subsequent to the assassination that some people construed to be\r\ndirected specifically at President Kennedy, and I think if there was\r\nsuch a speech that the Commission ought to have it and it ought to be\r\nanalyzed by the staff and by the Commission.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. We will be very glad to look into that and furnish you\r\nwith speeches made during this period or during a substantial part of\r\nthe period on both sides of the November 22 date.\r\n\r\nI gather the Commission has Mr. Danielle's interview with Mr. Castro on\r\nthe subject. You have the published report of that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that the long interview with Castro?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; that was as close to any reflection of a thing\r\nthat he might have said personally about this that went beyond the kind\r\nof broadcast speeches you referred to that I have seen, but----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you have that available?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. We certainly can get it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It was in the press I guess at the time. Maybe you have a\r\nfuller copy than we have.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes; it was a rather extensive interview.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAYES. I think the staff has it already.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think Commissioner Ford is referring to that speech of\r\nMr. Castro which is sometimes called the slip-of-the-tongue speech that\r\nreferred in a way that may have some implications in it. I think that\r\nmight help you to identify it, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. It might be well for me, just to complete the sense of\r\nthe atmosphere, to accompany that with the timing and the nature of\r\nstatements and speeches that were being made on our side as a part of\r\nthis continuing rather acrimonious discourse with Cuban leadership. But\r\nI will provide full information on this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We would appreciate it so it would give a complete picture.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do I understand now, Mr. Rankin, that what the\r\nSecretary provides will be put in the record as exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer to do that if that is\r\nsatisfactory, as a part of this record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir; it might be admitted.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is one question that I think ought to be\r\ncleared up, you mentioned Mr. Mann who was our Ambassador at Mexico\r\nat that time. The way the record stands now it could be construed by\r\nsomebody who wanted to so construe it that the country in which he\r\nserved us was involved in what he was reporting. I think it ought to be\r\nmade clear that is not the case.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. That is absolutely correct, sir. We never had the\r\nslightest view that Mexico was involved in this. The problem, the\r\nquestion arose because Mr. Oswald had been in Mexico, and was known to\r\nhave been in touch with some Cubans at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.\r\nBut the Mexican authorities gave us complete and the most helpful\r\ncooperation in full investigation of this matter.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are there any further questions? Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had you finished?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are we ready to go back on the record?\r\n\r\nAll right, the Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I should like to offer in evidence at\r\nthis point Commission Exhibit No. 984 being the communication from\r\nyourself as Chairman of the Commission to the Secretary of State, dated\r\nMarch 11, 1964, and the Note Verbale in regard to the inquiries of the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nAnd Commission Exhibit No. 985 being the responses of the Soviet Union,\r\nincluding all of the medical as well as all other responses together\r\nwith the transmittal letters from the Soviet Union and from the State\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 984 and 985 were marked for identification\r\nand received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would like to assign, Mr. Chief Justice, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 986, if I may, to those prior communications from the files\r\nof the Soviet Embassy in Washington that were furnished to us by the\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under that number.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 986 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Commission Exhibit No. 986 will be the copies of the\r\nrecords from the Soviet Embassy in Washington that were supplied to the\r\nCommission earlier by the State Department as a part of the records\r\nthat were furnished to us by the State Department.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Those were the ones that were voluntarily offered by the\r\nRussians before any request was made of them?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under that number.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, will you tell us whether you know of\r\nany credible evidence to show or establish or tending to show any\r\nconspiracy either domestic or foreign involved in the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. No; I have no evidence that would point in that\r\ndirection or to lead me to a conclusion that such a conspiracy existed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are there any further questions, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nIf not, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nSecretary RUSK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF FRANCES G. KNIGHT\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleman, will you state to Miss Knight, please, the reason we asked\r\nher to come here today?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Frances G. Knight is the head of the Passport Office\r\nof the State Department.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We want to ask her concerning the standard operating\r\nnotice with respect to the lookout card system which was in effect as\r\nof November--as of February 28, 1962, and we also wanted to ask her\r\nconcerning the decision of the Passport Office that Mr. Oswald had not\r\nexpatriated himself and, therefore, he should be reissued his passport.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, Miss Knight?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated. Mr. Coleman will ask you the questions.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Knight, will you state your name for the record?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Frances G. Knight.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What is your present address?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Home address?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. 2445 Wyoming Avenue NW.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What is your present position?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I am Director of the Passport Office in the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How long have you occupied that position?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Since May 1, 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you have any independent recollection of having ever\r\nlooked at any files dealing with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the time of\r\nthe assassination?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to mark as Commission Exhibit No. 989 a\r\nmemorandum from Frances G. Knight to Mr. William O. Boswell, which\r\nbears the date of December 26, 1961, and is found among the State\r\nDepartment file No. XI, document No. 12 and ask you whether you have\r\nseen the original of that document? (Commission Exhibit No. 989 was\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Sir, you want to know whether I personally saw this before\r\nit went out?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. This is a little difficult to answer. There are a great\r\nmany communications that go out over my name particularly a memo of\r\nthis sort, which would be prepared in the Passport Office, and I\r\nwould--I might sign it or if I were not in the office at the time my\r\ndeputy might sign it for me.\r\n\r\nBut these communications usually go out over my name.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, Miss Knight, does that document----\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. This one looks as though it was initialed by me because it\r\nhas the type of a \"K\" that I make.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That document indicates that it was prepared by Miss B.\r\nWaterman, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. There is no indication here, sir. It was prepared in the\r\nforeign division of the Passport Office, but there is no indication on\r\nthis communication as to the individual who prepared it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you be kind enough to read what is on the memorandum\r\ninto the record, please?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; the memorandum is addressed to \"SY,\" Mr. William\r\nO. Boswell from PPT--Frances G. Knight, subject \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\"\r\n\r\n\"We refer to the Office Memorandum of July 27, 1961, from SY which\r\nstated that the subject 'renounced United States citizenship'. Mr.\r\nOswald attempted to renounce United States citizenship but did not,\r\nin fact, renounce United States citizenship. Our determination on the\r\nbasis of the information and evidence presently of record is that Mr.\r\nOswald did not expatriate himself, and remains a citizen of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThe blue file copy would indicate who prepared this memorandum in the\r\nPassport Office and who signed it.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Do you have the file copy?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I don't think we have it with us, do we? [Note: The file\r\ncopy was shown to Miss Knight.] The memorandum was prepared by Mr. H.\r\nF. Kupiec, who is in the Foreign Operations Division of the Passport\r\nOffice. It was signed for me by Mr. Hickey, who is the deputy.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You have no independent recollection of ever having seen\r\nthat document prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you ever participate or make any decision as to\r\nwhether Lee Harvey Oswald lost his citizenship?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In 1959?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you ever make any personal decision or participate in\r\nany decision as to whether he should be reissued a passport in July\r\n1961?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I, therefore, take it you personally had nothing or you\r\ncan't recall anything that you had to do with Lee Harvey Oswald up to\r\nthe time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No; I had nothing to do with the papers that were involved\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. But the decision that he had not renounced his citizenship\r\nwas made in your department?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. It was made in the Passport Office by the citizenship\r\nlawyers. The two persons who were primarily involved were members of\r\nthe staff, of long-standing service and with a great deal of experience\r\nin citizenship law and in expatriation.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Could you state the names, their names for the record?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; Miss Bernice Waterman, and Mr. John T. White.\r\n\r\nBoth of those employees have now retired from the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You said both were lawyers?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Miss Waterman was not a lawyer but she worked directly\r\nunder Mr. John T. White who was a lawyer in charge of the Foreign\r\nOperations Division.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Well, since the assassination of President Kennedy, have\r\nyou had occasion to review the passport file.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, the first time that I actually had an opportunity to\r\nlook through the passport file was last Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you get a chance to read each document in the file?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I read through the file; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Did you have occasion to form any judgment whether based\r\nupon the information that was in the file you would have reached the\r\nsame decision as Waterman and White did with respect to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; I certainly did. From that standpoint, I did go\r\nthrough the papers carefully. I am convinced that insofar as any\r\nexpatriative act is concerned that we made the only decision that we\r\ncould. The same decision was reached by the consul who interviewed Mr.\r\nOswald in Moscow, at the Embassy, and I think, with all the facts on\r\nrecord, we had to come to the conclusion that Oswald did not perform\r\nany expatriative act.\r\n\r\n(At this point, the Chief Justice left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT (continuing). May I ask one question, please?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I have a statement here, some notes that I prepared this\r\nmorning which are based on the information I read in the file. These\r\nare some comments I would make and I think they may be helpful to you.\r\nCould I refer to them or possibly read them to you?\r\n\r\nWould that be all right?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That would be fine.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. After reading the file----\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. And by \"file\" you mean the passport file?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The passport file of Lee Harvey Oswald, I would say the\r\nhandling of the case would break down into three separate actions: One,\r\nthe adjudication of his citizenship; two, the documentation of his\r\nrepatriation loan, and, three, the issuance of a passport to Oswald on\r\nJune 25, 1963.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, the Commission has been furnished with detailed\r\ninformation covering all these actions, and in addition we have\r\nsupplied replies which were prepared in the Passport Office by our\r\nstaff to the specific questions that were posed by the Commission.\r\n\r\nMy comments on the citizenship and expatriation phase of the Oswald\r\ncase are these: Insofar as the Oswald citizenship status is concerned,\r\nit is my firm belief that Lee Harvey Oswald, despite his statement to\r\nthe U.S. consul in Moscow, that he wished to divest himself of U.S.\r\ncitizenship, did not do so.\r\n\r\nAt no time did he sign the required documents which were available to\r\nhim for that purpose. Oswald was a 20-year-old ex-Marine, and the U.S.\r\nconsul made it quite clear in his despatches to the Department, that\r\nOswald was arrogant and aggressive, and angry and unstable.\r\n\r\nI had not had the opportunity to read the file until last Saturday,\r\nbecause it was taken out of the Passport Office on November 23, 1963.\r\nHowever, I do not recall----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By whom?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. It was asked for and sent to the Administrator of the\r\nBureau of Security and Consular Affairs, Mr. Abba Schwartz. I want to\r\nmake a correction on that date. It was on November 22 that the file was\r\ntaken out of the Passport Office. Late at night, I believe.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that the file, the passport folder, contained any\r\ninformation that would tag Oswald as a U.S. Communist, or a Communist\r\nsympathizer prior to his visit to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and there\r\nis no record that he engaged in any public denunciation of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nDuring the time Oswald's citizenship status was in question, that is\r\nfrom the time he had advised the U.S. consul in Moscow that he wished\r\nto renounce his citizenship, to the time it was determined he had not\r\ncommitted an expatriative act, a period of almost 2 years, his file was\r\nflagged and according to our records a lookout card was ordered for the\r\nlookout file.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 1960, the Passport Office advised the U.S. Embassy in\r\nMoscow that \"An appropriate notice has been placed in the lookout card\r\nsection of the Passport Office in the event that Mr. Oswald should\r\napply for documentation at a post outside the Soviet Union.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. We will note for the record that document you are\r\nreferring to--I think it is the Operations Memorandum of May 23,\r\n1960--has been given Commission Exhibit No. 963.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. In view of the volume of our work it would be impossible\r\nat this late date for a clerk in the Passport Office to remember\r\nwhether a card was actually made or not made. Apparently no card was\r\nfound in the 1961 search of the lookout file, but again it is possible\r\nthat such a card was misfiled. It is also possible if a card was made\r\nit was destroyed in error, but whether there was a card made or not has\r\nno bearing on the final outcome of the decision regarding the Oswald\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask a question there. Would you prefer to read this\r\nentire document first?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No; it is easier----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it conceivable that the lookout card could have been\r\nremoved in 1961 when his passport was extended to return to the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nUnder your procedure would that have been done?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Under our procedure when he was issued the passport that\r\ncard would have been removed; yes. So that in 1961 there would not have\r\nbeen a card in the file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Even though the passport was issued specifically saying it\r\nwas only good for return to the United States and only good for 1 month.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nThe passport was limited and could not be used beyond the time it was\r\nlimited for.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would that have caused the card to be removed?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Issuance of that passport, even a limited passport would\r\nhave resulted in the card being withdrawn?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The card would have been withdrawn at the time that his\r\ncitizenship was adjudicated, and when it was found that he had not\r\nexpatriated himself. The card which was put in the file related only to\r\nhis citizenship status.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what--somewhat earlier, that is several months\r\nbefore the passport was extended?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That would mean when he came back into the United States\r\nand he then reapplied 2 days later for another passport it would have\r\ngone through routinely and you would not have picked up the fact that\r\nit was Oswald the defector that was now going to go back out of the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, that would be possible, I think; yes.\r\n\r\nThe experienced citizenship attorneys in the Passport Office, as well\r\nas the U.S. consul in Moscow determined individually that Oswald had\r\nnot expatriated himself. His passport was renewed in May 1962, and\r\nlimited for return to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the adjudication of his citizenship, we can only deal with the\r\nfacts on record. The fact is that Oswald did not avail himself of the\r\nprescribed procedure to renounce his U.S. nationality.\r\n\r\nIn applying for his passport renewal, he stated under oath that he had\r\nnot committed an expatriative act. He denied an earlier statement that\r\nhe had applied for Soviet citizenship, and produced some evidence that\r\nhe had never been declared a Soviet citizen.\r\n\r\nNow, as far as the repatriation loan is concerned, the recording of\r\nsuch a loan in the Passport office is a very routine procedure.\r\n\r\nApparently there is some question as to whether a lookout card was\r\ninserted in the lookout file at the time that the repatriation loan\r\nwas made to Oswald. The Passport Office must depend on the Office of\r\nFinance to inform it with regard to repatriation loans. We require\r\ncertain information such as the name of the individual, the place and\r\ndate of birth, and other information which will identify the individual\r\nin our files.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that this information be complete and accurate\r\nto guard against embarrassing situations which could develop from\r\nmisidentification.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for the procedure were developed over several years by the\r\nOffice of Finance in cooperation with the Passport Office. Memorandum\r\nbetween the Passport Office and the Office of Finance have been\r\nprovided to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe important one is dated January 16, 1962, and spells out the\r\ncriteria that we established by mutual consent. The Passport Office was\r\nand is directly concerned with only two actions in repatriation cases.\r\n\r\nThe insertion of an accurate and identifiable card in the lookout file\r\nand the prompt removal of such a card when the loan has been repaid.\r\n\r\nBetween August 1961 and December 1962 there was a purge of our lookout\r\nfile because the cards were so shoddy and unreadable that they had to\r\nbe refreshed.\r\n\r\nWe call them cards. But they actually were not cards, merely slips of\r\npink paper 3 by 5 inches which were very badly worn and torn.\r\n\r\nMore than 1 million applications are cleared over this file annually,\r\nand it was imperative for us to find a system which would provide fast\r\nand accurate clearances.\r\n\r\nDuring the renovation of this lookout file we found over 3,000 cards\r\nrelating to repatriation loans which were unidentifiable. They had been\r\nin the file for decades, and they were of no value. They failed to give\r\nus any leads to either the passport or security files. The individuals\r\ninvolved may long since have passed to their reward. We did not know\r\nwhat had happened to them so we took these cards out of the files.\r\n\r\nThe record indicates that the Finance Office did not have Oswald's\r\nplace and date of birth, and did not advise the Passport Office of the\r\nrepatriation loan.\r\n\r\nThere may have been efforts to obtain the information necessary to\r\nmake up a lookout card and this may have been suspended because Oswald\r\nstarted a series of payments within 10 weeks of the loan.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the Passport Office was notified when the loan was\r\nfully paid about 6 months later, which was January 1963. Had a card\r\nbeen placed in the lookout file it would have been removed upon such\r\nnotification.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there would have been no card in the files relating to\r\nthe repatriation loan at the time Oswald made his application for a\r\npassport at the New Orleans Passport Agency on June 24, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Knight, when Oswald was issued the June 1963\r\npassport, I take it that there was no reference made to his passport\r\nfile, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No reference was made to his passport file. When he made\r\nhis application at the New Orleans agency it was handled in a routine\r\nmanner which I believe has been described to the Commission in some\r\ndocuments we prepared for you. Oswald's name was included in a list\r\nof applicants sent by teletype from New Orleans to Washington for\r\nclearance over the lookout file.\r\n\r\nIt was cleared within a day. There was no card relating to the\r\nrepatriation loan because Oswald had made his final payment on the loan\r\n6 months prior to his application for the passport.\r\n\r\nThere was no lookout card relating to loss of nationality because it\r\nhad been determined by that time he had committed no expatriative act\r\nand therefore did not lose his citizenship. There was no lookout card\r\non Oswald indicating that he was under indictment or wanted by an\r\ninvestigative agency or by the police. There was no fraud committed,\r\nand there was no evidence that he was a member of the Communist Party\r\nor active in it. In other words, there was nothing on record in our\r\nfiles in June 1963 which would have given the Passport Office any\r\nreason for delaying or denying Lee Harvey Oswald a passport.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Is it your testimony that if when the teletype had come in\r\nfrom New Orleans, and someone in your office had gone and looked at the\r\npassport file, and found out that Oswald attempted to defect in 1959\r\nand had made the statements that he made at the Embassy in 1959, that\r\nnevertheless you feel that under the existing regulations you would\r\nhave to issue him a passport?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; we would. We wouldn't have had a lookout card based\r\non that at the time of his application for a passport because all the\r\nsituations we mentioned were resolved by that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I would like to show you a Commission document which has\r\nalready been marked as Exhibit No. 951, which is the standard operating\r\nnotice of the passport office, dated February 28, 1962, and ask you are\r\nyou familiar with this document?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Excuse me for a second, please. There is one subsequent to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; but that is the one that was in effect as of June\r\n1963, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Attached thereto is a list which indicates the various\r\ncategories for the lookout card.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you look at category K, and I would like to ask you\r\nwhether the information which was in the file on Mr. Oswald, including\r\nthe FBI reports, which were in the file of June 1963, should have\r\ncaused Oswald to be put in category K?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How about category R?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you read category K?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; certainly. \"K\" is \"Known or suspected Communist or\r\nsubversive\". And \"does not include those falling within categories O\r\nand P\".\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would you tell me what \"O\" and \"P\" categories are?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. \"O\" is a category of cards in which the FBI has special\r\ninterest. And \"P\" is also a project of the same sort.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Has the FBI ever put defectors in that category?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; we are given the names and we put a lookout card in\r\nthe file. But we are not told the reason why. We simply advise the\r\nagency involved.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In other words, if the FBI merely sends you a report on a\r\nparticular person, that wouldn't cause you to put someone in \"O\" and\r\n\"P\"? It is only when the FBI says put the person in \"O\" or \"P\"?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Only when a request is specific.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. How about category \"R\", if you will put that in the record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question first, what is the criteria\r\nfor the determination as to whether or not a person is a Communist?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, the criteria are based on the information that\r\nwe get from the investigative agencies regarding his activities and\r\nmembership in the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nI think that it would help you very much if, for instance, I would\r\nspell out what the lookout file actually is and how it operates in the\r\nPassport Office and just what the categories mean to us. This would\r\nonly take a minute and I think this would clarify things.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have picked out the categories that I think you would\r\nhave to consider, and that is the reason I put the question to you.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The purpose of the file is rather important because it\r\nis twofold. Its principal role is to identify the applications which\r\nrequire other than routine adjudication in determining an applicant's\r\neligibility for passport services. The second role of the file is to\r\nidentify certain incoming applications and to insure expeditious action\r\non them.\r\n\r\nAs background, I think it is important to know, that prior to 1955 the\r\nlookout file was part of a master index comprising 20 million 3 by 5\r\ninch cards.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 20 million?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. 20 million. Within this voluminous file were 600,000 pink\r\nslips. Now these were known in those days as \"catch cards,\" and these\r\nwere withdrawn in 1958 to establish the nucleus of the present lookout\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThe reason for doing so was quite obvious. It was impossible and\r\ntotally impracticable to clear every passport application across a 20\r\nmillion card file which was expanding at the rate of 1 million cards a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCards at that time were being made for every applicant and his\r\nrelatives who were listed on the passport application. Every individual\r\nwhose name appeared in any investigative report which was sent to the\r\nPassport Office, whether or not the individual applied for a passport;\r\nevery individual who appeared before an investigative committee of\r\nCongress, whether or not he applied for a passport; as well as persons\r\nwhose names appeared in such situations as gambling raids, lottery\r\nwinners, and so forth. These were all in the passport file, and part of\r\nthe master index.\r\n\r\nFile experts from the General Services Administration estimated at that\r\ntime that 30 percent of this master index was misfiled.\r\n\r\nBy a program of refinement in 1959 and 1960, the lookout file\r\nwas reduced to 415,000 cards. We felt we were reasonably safe in\r\ndisregarding catch cards on persons who were a hundred years old or\r\nover. So these were eliminated from the files.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of accuracy in identification, the cards that\r\nremained still left much to be desired in the file.\r\n\r\nNow again I would say these were not \"cards\" in any sense that they had\r\nphysical substance. They were 3 by 5 inch slips of tissue-thin pink\r\npaper. They were very mutilated and many of them were totally illegible.\r\n\r\nMany of them were of no significance since they contained no\r\nidentifying data, such as place or date of birth, no full names, no\r\nreason for the inclusion in the file. As far as we could determine they\r\nwere not related to anything in the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nSo further culling and screening reduced this basic file to the present\r\nsize of 250,000 cards.\r\n\r\nThis project was very----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that two or four?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. 250 now.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 250. It is different.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. We had reduced it to 450,000 and we culled it some more\r\nand it is now 250,000.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is a reduction from the earlier 450,000?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right. This project was very time-consuming and\r\ntedious but it had to be done, and it was completed in 1962, at which\r\ntime we transferred all the data on the cards we considered active onto\r\na permanent IBM key punch card system which was coded and legible.\r\n\r\nTo relate this file, this tremendous file, to the Oswald case, I think\r\nit should be remembered that the Passport Office is not a police\r\norganization, nor is it an investigative agency. We must depend on\r\nother sources in and out of the Government to supply us with the\r\ninformation which we must adjudicate under the criteria of the passport\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nWhen we issued a passport to Oswald in June 1963 we felt that he had\r\nnot expatriated himself and that determination was made.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. In 1963 you didn't make any judgment at all. He just\r\nwasn't in the lookout file so you just issued it. You didn't make any\r\nindependent judgment at that time in 1963, did you?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. If we had thought he had expatriated himself we would have\r\nhad a card in his file.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; but in 1963 no decision was made.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. There was no question raised. There was never a question\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. It was never a question because your Office never looked\r\nat the file.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Not at the file, but his application was checked over the\r\nlookout cards.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Oswald didn't owe money to the Government, and he was not\r\ninvolved in fraud or criminal activity. So, in retrospect, I feel that\r\nOswald could have had a catch card inserted in the lookout file under\r\na very broad and undefined category which is right here, as number \"R\"\r\nand that is, \"Individuals whose actions do not reflect credit to the\r\nUnited States abroad,\" but for practical reasons this category is very\r\nnarrowly construed in view of the hundreds of U.S. citizen bad-check\r\nartists, the drunks, the con men, the psychotics who travel worldwide,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nMy office is deluged with requests from irate U.S. citizens returning\r\nfrom abroad asking us to do something about some of the people they\r\nfind traveling overseas.\r\n\r\nWe have no such authority, and we are not in a position to determine\r\nthe good or bad behavior of U.S. citizens here or abroad.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nI think it is a debatable question as to whether Oswald fell into this\r\nbroad category of \"R\" and finally there was no request in the file from\r\nany Government agency or any area of the Government for a lookout card\r\non Oswald for this reason or any other reason at the time that his 1963\r\npassport was issued.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who finally determines whether a lookout card should be\r\nmade? Would you determine that or in your office?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That would be determined within our domestic operation\r\ndivision, our foreign operation or our legal division. An adjudicator,\r\nfor instance, is the first person to make a decision.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. If the FBI or CIA asked you to put in a card you would do\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; and this is part of \"O\" and \"P\" project.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you read again that paragraph about Communist or\r\nCommunist sympathizer?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Category K is, \"Known or suspected Communist or\r\nsubversive.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you interpret that pretty narrowly?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why do you interpret it narrowly?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, this goes back to a question of passport regulations\r\nand the decision, the Supreme Court decision in the Kent-Briehl case\r\nand passport denials. I believe we sent you the regulations currently\r\nin effect.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The record will note that it is attached to Commission\r\nExhibit No. 948, which is the letter from Mr. Chayes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Would you like an extra copy of it?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask a further question there? When you issue a\r\npassport limited solely to returning to the United States, isn't that\r\nsome indication that you don't want the fellow traveling around abroad?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. There would be some indication, yes, but there may be many\r\nreasons for it. It may be a general indication that he should not be\r\ntraveling around abroad.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that normally you wouldn't issue a passport with that\r\nlimitation and then let him come right into the Passport Office and\r\nreissue a passport to go abroad.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, if it is a case which merits a stop card we wouldn't\r\ndo it. But in this case of Oswald----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In this case would there be a stop card?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. In the case of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. No; I mean in the case of anybody who is abroad and you\r\nissue him a passport only to travel back to the United States, to get\r\nhim back to the United States, if then in the next week he went into\r\nthe Passport Office and wanted a passport to travel back to Europe,\r\nwhich means Russia if he wants to go to Russia, would you issue him a\r\npassport or would you not?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I think that depends very much on the record that we would\r\nhave on him.\r\n\r\nThe issuance of passports is pretty well defined in the new\r\nregulations. I would say that a decade ago a passport application\r\nfor Oswald would have been denied, or at least it would have been\r\nsubstantially delayed.\r\n\r\nBut this was prior to the Supreme Court decision of June 16, 1958.\r\nPrior to that there was very little challenge to the Secretary's\r\ndiscretionary authority in the issuance of passports.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is important to realize that the Supreme Court in\r\nits decision held that there was no legislative authority for the\r\nSecretary's regulations in denying a passport to persons supporting\r\nthe world Communist movement. The Court stated in that decision that\r\nthe freedom of travel is indeed an important aspect of the citizen's\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nSince that time Congress has made numerous attempts to provide\r\nlegislation to curb the travel of U.S. Communists, and those citizens\r\nwhose travel abroad is not in the best interests of the United States,\r\nbut for one reason or another Congress has failed to pass any such\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1962, the Secretary of State promulgated passport\r\nregulations which provide for the confrontation and full discovery in\r\nall cases involving the curtailment of passport privileges.\r\n\r\nSo, as a result, the Department's decisions in all passport cases have\r\nto be based on an open record.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that these regulations make it virtually impossible\r\nto deny passports to U.S. Communists because the source and record and\r\ndetails of their nefarious activities are not an open record, as you\r\nwell know, and quite obviously they cannot be made an open record by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Don't you have a specific statute and a specific\r\nregulation which says that if a person is a member of the Communist\r\nParty after it has been required to register that you have to deny him\r\na passport?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. This is true, but with these regulations, we are directed\r\nto issue passports to active members of the Communist Party despite the\r\nfact that section 6 of the Internal Security Act prohibits the issuance\r\nof passports to those individuals whom we have reason to believe or\r\nknow are members of the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What regulation requires you to issue them a passport?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, the Department's regulations are very specific on\r\nthis point. They state and I quote, \"In making its decision\"----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Could you identify the regulation?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; it is 51.138(b).\r\n\r\nWould you like me to read that section?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. All right.\r\n\r\n\"(b) The applicant shall, upon request by the hearing officer, confirm\r\nhis oral statements in an affidavit for the record. After the applicant\r\nhas presented his case, the Passport Office shall review the record\r\nand advise the applicant of its decision. In making its decision, the\r\nPassport Office shall not take into consideration confidential security\r\ninformation that is not made available to the applicant in accordance\r\nwith paragraph (a) of this section. If the decision is adverse to the\r\napplicant, he shall be notified in writing, and the notification shall\r\nstate the reasons for the decision. Such notification shall also inform\r\nthe applicant of his right to appeal to the Board of Passport Appeals\r\nunder section 51.139.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. What in there says you have to issue a passport to a\r\nperson that you know is a member of the Communist Party after there has\r\nbeen a decision that the Communist Party has to register under the 1950\r\nact?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. In accordance with these regulations we cannot consider\r\ninformation in the passport file if that information is confidential\r\nand can't be used in open court or in an open hearing. The information\r\non persons who are involved in the Communist activities is, for the\r\nmost part, confidential information and cannot be revealed in open\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. You say, if you have an FBI report which says that \"Mr. So\r\nand So\" is a member of the Communist Party, and that is in your record,\r\nand if he applies for a passport, you have to issue him that passport?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Under the regulations of the Department we would have to\r\nissue him a passport if the information in the FBI report cannot be\r\nmade public.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There has to be information which is confidential,\r\nhowever?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, the information in the report and the determination\r\nas to whether that information can be made public and can be used in\r\ncourt is made by the investigative agency that provides it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, if the agency, the security agency has\r\na card issued by the Communist Party to this individual, and that\r\ninformation is given to the applicant, you can still deny this passport\r\nunder section 51.135, can't you?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. You mean if the FBI, let's say an FBI report, gave us\r\ninformation that the person is an active member of the Communist Party?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That he has actually, just for illustrative\r\npurposes, a card issued by the Communist Party and the Department gives\r\nthis information to the applicant, it is not confidential, it is given\r\nto the applicant, can't you deny a passport under section 51.135?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, then, I think the answer is that you do have\r\nauthority to deny passports to Communists where the information----\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Is made available.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is made available.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; where the information is made available and can be\r\nused in an open hearing.\r\n\r\nBut from a practical operation, this is very difficult to do because\r\nmost of the information in the FBI reports is confidential and by\r\nbringing forth their informers they certainly destroy their security.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Miss Knight, the same regulation that is in effect today\r\nwas also the regulation in effect in 1963, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, as of March 14, 1964, didn't the Department establish\r\nanother category for lookout cards, namely for defectors?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; we have that. I think that was provided to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, you do that under whatever authority that you had as\r\nof 1963, don't you? You haven't been given any additional congressional\r\nauthority, have you?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No; but we haven't denied passports to any of them, either.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Does that mean that despite this memorandum from Mr.\r\nSchwartz to you under date of March 14, 1964, if a known defector came\r\nin and asked for a passport, you would issue him one today?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No; we wouldn't issue. A card would be put in the lookout\r\nfile to indicate that this person was a defector, and in such a case\r\nthe file would go to Mr. Johnson's office, our legal counsel. It would\r\nbe referred to his security branch, and be adjudicated. However, I\r\ndon't believe that a passport could be denied to them on the basis of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Now, you know that in October 1963 the Passport Office\r\nreceived information that Mr. Oswald had been down to the Russian\r\nEmbassy in Mexico?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Would that fact cause the Department to attempt to revoke\r\na passport which had already been issued?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir; because there are many U.S. citizens who go to\r\nSoviet Embassies, and the fact he went there may have been for the\r\npurpose of getting information; it certainly was not a reason to deny a\r\npassport.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There aren't many people like Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nwith a record of that background. It would seem to me that that, the\r\navailability of that information, ought to have flagged some interest\r\nsome place in the State Department or the Passport Office.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, in my opinion, passports are being issued today to\r\nindividuals whose activities and past record of behavior are patently\r\nmore detrimental to the security and best interests of the United\r\nStates than any report or any record that we had in the file of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That may be true, and I might agree with you, but\r\nwe can only deal with the specific case, and it concerns me that this\r\ninformation which was made available, somehow didn't get some attention\r\nin the Passport Division.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I think my answer to that is that there was attention\r\ngiven to it but there was no action that could be taken on it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we gave attention to it is beside the point.\r\n\r\nIf we had had a lookout card in the file, and under different\r\ncircumstances, there may have been some reason for seeking further\r\ninformation. I do know that the FBI was reviewing his file at regular\r\nintervals, and I think the file shows that.\r\n\r\nTo get the full import of our action one would have to read the\r\nsecurity files and the records of certain individuals to whom we have\r\nbeen forced to give passports, and put them beside the Oswald file. The\r\ncomparison would be very interesting.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Might I ask just a few questions?\r\n\r\nFirst, let me say I missed part of the testimony because I was in the\r\nSenate and could not come here until after we had voted.\r\n\r\nI am now looking at Federal Register, Title 22--Foreign Relations,\r\nChapter 1: Department of State, part 51, dealing with passports. This\r\ntitle refers to the issuing officer.\r\n\r\nWho is the issuing officer? Does that mean you or those who are under\r\nyou, who are responsible to you?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, this is a question. Up until recently, I think the\r\ndirector of the Passport Office was considered the issuing officer.\r\nHowever, passports are issued in the name of the Secretary of State,\r\nwho has the authority and the responsibility on passports.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And you are responsible to the Secretary of State?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Through the echelons.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nNow, Representative Ford and Mr. Dulles have gone into this, as well as\r\ncounsel, but I would like to pursue it just a little bit.\r\n\r\nSection 51.135, entitled \"Denial of passports to members of Communist\r\norganizations,\" states, \"A passport shall not be issued to, or renewed\r\nfor, any individual who the issuing officer knows or has reason to\r\nbelieve is a member of a Communist organization registered or required\r\nto be registered under section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control\r\nAct of 1950, as amended.\"\r\n\r\nWas there any evidence in the files of Lee Harvey Oswald which could\r\ngive to the issuing officer either the knowledge that he was a member\r\nof a Communist organization or such evidence as would lead the issuing\r\nofficer to believe that he was?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Because, there was nothing in the passport file or\r\nin the reports that we received from investigative agencies that\r\nwould indicate that he had any Communist leanings or any Communist\r\naffiliations prior to his sojourn in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. There wasn't anything in his file from the reports of\r\nthe State Department concerning his defection to Russia and his return\r\nwhich indicated that he was a member of the Communist Party?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Or a Communist organization?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there anything in the files from the FBI or any\r\nother security agency which would give you that information?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. None that I saw; no, sir. I do know that there were two\r\nrecent intelligence reports from the FBI, and they were dated October\r\n31, 1963, and October 25, 1963, and these were logged into the Passport\r\nOffice on November 20, 1963, and on November 22, 1963, respectively.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. They were then, of course, would have been, received in\r\nthe office after the time.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That was the date of the assassination.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. After the time that the passport had been renewed.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. That included the information that he was active in the\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is correct, and these were referred to us by the\r\nOffice of Security, and then on 5:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963, these\r\nreports were called for on an urgent basis by the Administrator of the\r\nBureau of Security and Consular Affairs and we delivered them to him at\r\napproximately 7:30 that morning.\r\n\r\nI never saw these reports and no one in the Passport Office had an\r\nopportunity to read them or see them.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The point I am making is, am I correct or are you\r\ncorrect, when you say at the time Oswald's passport was either issued\r\nor renewed to make the trip to Mexico City, that there was no evidence\r\nin his files of any kind which would indicate that he was a member of a\r\nCommunist organization?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir; there was nothing in the file.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What weight would you give to the fact that he had\r\ndefected and had returned to the United States, and had claimed once\r\nthat he wanted to renounce American citizenship? Would that be a fact\r\nto which you would give weight in determining whether or not you\r\nbelieved he was a member of the Communist organization?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; I understand your question. I did not adjudicate\r\nthe Oswald citizenship case. But I would say that the adjudicators must\r\nhave taken into consideration his instability which was reported in the\r\ndispatches, his attitude, his age, he was 20 years old at the time,\r\nand the fact that when he finally made his appeal to come back to the\r\nUnited States, he denied that he had asked for Soviet citizenship, that\r\nhe was considered a Soviet citizen, and he further denied that he had\r\noffered anybody information.\r\n\r\nHe denied practically everything that he, in very bad temper, had told\r\nthe consul that he was going to do. This, I think, is fairly well\r\nestablished in the document he signed, and which was sent to us when\r\nhis passport was renewed and limited for return to the United States.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I am first directing my attention to the issuance or\r\nrenewal of the passport which enabled him to go to Mexico City. I want\r\nto keep on that for a moment.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. He didn't have a passport for Mexico City.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Not a passport for Mexico City.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. He had the passport in June 1963.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes; to go over to Cuba and different places.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. We did not know, and there was nothing, I think I am right\r\nabout this, there is nothing in our files to indicate that he went to\r\nCuba or that he went to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. I understand\r\nthis was brought out.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes; that is true.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Not until October 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Even then, Mr. Dulles, they didn't know. The notice they\r\ngot from Mexico only stated that he had been at the Soviet Embassy and\r\nnot that he had been over to the Cuban Embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The point I am trying to develop at some point in 1963\r\nprior to the assassination he went to the office in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right, the New Orleans Passport Agency.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And he secured a passport there.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. He applied for a passport.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. To travel, applied for a passport, to travel in a\r\nnumber of countries.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And that was issued to him.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. On the following day?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. At that time, of course, the issuing officer was under\r\nthe restrictions of the regulations here that we have been talking\r\nabout. What would the officer--would the officer in New Orleans have\r\nany information available to him?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. About Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir; the operation works like this: New Orleans is one\r\nof eight passport agencies in the United States. They are connected\r\nwith the main office by teletype. Oswald made an application for a\r\npassport at the New Orleans agency, and they TWX'd to us, his name and\r\nidentification--that is, date and place of birth, and so on. His name\r\nwas one on a list of names. There may have been 15 or 20 of them.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. The record shows there were 25.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. 25.\r\n\r\nThese names were then checked over the lookout file which I have\r\nexplained here.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Here in Washington?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes; and if there is no card in the lookout file, it is\r\npresumed that he is clear, because if we had information that he was an\r\nactive Communist, or that we had reason to believe that there should\r\nbe further check on him, this would have been reflected in the lookout\r\nfile. There was no such card in the file.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All right. At that time, then, when he had made his\r\napplication and the information was sent to your office, there was no\r\nlookout card?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which would indicate that he was a Communist or a\r\nmember of a Communist organization, registered, and so forth. And did\r\nyou have such a system then?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Of lookout cards?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; we have had that system for a long time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was your reason for not having a lookout card for\r\nOswald, that there wasn't anything in his file to indicate that he was\r\na member of a Communist organization?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that the reason?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is correct. Because the FBI reports which had come\r\nto the Passport Office during his sojourn in the Soviet Union and\r\nafter, did not indicate that he was a Communist. As a matter of fact,\r\nthey were concerned with several other things, his mother's concern\r\nregarding his whereabouts, the fact that he had made a declaration that\r\nhe wished to become a Soviet citizen; and the question of expatriation.\r\nBut there was nothing in the files to indicate that he had had any\r\ncontact or any active part in the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The fact that he had married a Russian girl and brought\r\nher to the United States have any significance in the determination\r\nthat the issuing officer would have to make?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You are sure that the FBI nor any other security agency\r\nhad placed any information in that file which would fall within the\r\nscope of this first section dealing with, applicable to passports?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I am sure of that; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you yourself examined those files?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I examined the file last Saturday for the first time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And do you know who had charge of the file?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The file was in the Passport Office up until November 22,\r\nthe day of the assassination.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Where did it go then?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. It went to the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, to\r\nMr. Schwartz.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who is in charge there?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Mr. Schwartz. He is the Administrator.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. I might add he turned them over immediately, he turned\r\nthem over to Mr. Chayes who was authorized to take charge of all files\r\nand they were maintained in the Office of the Legal Adviser.\r\n\r\nAnd anyone in the Department who wanted to review them was free to do\r\nso but we kept them all in one place.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you been testifying?\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. I have broken in.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Just for the purpose of the record identify yourself.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. I have not been sworn in. My name is Thomas Ehrlich, I am\r\nSpecial Assistant to the Legal Adviser to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I might add Mr. Chayes testified in some detail that\r\nhe was asked by Mr. Ball, Acting Secretary of State, on the night,\r\nafternoon, late afternoon and late evening of the assassination, to\r\nget all the files regarding Oswald together and to prepare for him and\r\nthe Secretary of State, who was returning the next morning, a detailed\r\nreport on the whole Oswald case, and I assume that the file went from\r\nyou to Mr. Schwartz, to Mr. Chayes.\r\n\r\nAnd from there Mr. Chayes collected reports from other sources.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. That is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I am not questioning any fact that these people\r\ntestified to but I think for the record it is important to know where\r\nthe file was and whether or not it is the same file, with the same\r\npapers in it that were in existence on November 22, which you turned\r\nover to your superior.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, of course, we presume all the papers are in there.\r\nThe file was pretty thick, and, of course, it takes time to go over the\r\npapers. We had not time to look at the file or to check it, and there\r\nis no way of knowing whether any papers were taken in or out.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Senator Cooper, we have the files and we also have letters\r\nfrom Mr. Chayes that to the best of his knowledge and ability every\r\npiece of paper which the State Department had which in any way bore on\r\nOswald has now been turned over to the Commission and those letters\r\nwere marked today.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I go a little further.\r\n\r\nLook at 51.136, \"Limitations on issuance of passports to certain other\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\"In order to promote and safeguard the interests of the United States,\r\npassport facilities, except for direct and immediate return to the\r\nUnited States, shall be refused to a person when it appears to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Secretary of State that the person's activities\r\nabroad would: (a) Violate the laws of the United States; (b) be\r\nprejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations; or (c)\r\notherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nNow, at the time this passport was issued to Oswald in New Orleans, was\r\nthere any information in his passport file about his conduct in New\r\nOrleans in connection with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. There was nothing in the passport file on that. It is my\r\nunderstanding that there were two FBI reports that had come in and they\r\nwere logged into the Passport Office on November 20 and November 22.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I know, but I am thinking of June 24, 1963. This\r\ndecision to issue a passport to Oswald to go to Mexico and various\r\nother countries was made on when?\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. June 24, 1963.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there any information in his file relative to his\r\nparticipation in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The first information that came to the office came in\r\nNovember?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. November 20 and 22.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And November 22.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. And I think, Senator, you would be interested to know that\r\nthese FBI reports are sent to us by the Office of Security.\r\n\r\nA large volume of these reports come to us in the Passport Office on a\r\nvery routine basis.\r\n\r\nThe last 6 months of 1963 over 3,000 such reports were received, that\r\nis 500 security reports a month, and in order to be effective and\r\nto render the ultimate in security these reports should be read by\r\nindividuals who are knowledgeable; who are trained to spot information\r\nof security significance.\r\n\r\nThe staff that is assigned to this task is very limited, and it is\r\nheavily overburdened with many assignments, some of which take priority\r\nto the reading of reports, and it is physically impossible for the\r\npresent staff of our legal division, which is headed by Mr. Johnson, to\r\nread and analyze the information in these reports as promptly and as\r\nthoroughly as should be done.\r\n\r\nThe eternal question that we are faced with is a matter of diminishing\r\nreturns. It is almost impossible to staff the Passport Office 100\r\npercent for security and with knowledgeability of everything that goes\r\non, and in the course of the year the Passport Office puts in thousands\r\nof hours of overtime, uncompensated overtime, trying to catch up with\r\nthis work and believe me, this makes little or no impression on the\r\nvast amount of paperwork, the reading, the reporting and the analyzing\r\nof reports which come in to us.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I can see your problem.\r\n\r\nBut now, assuming that this report from the FBI about Oswald's\r\nactivities in New Orleans with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in\r\nwhich he was distributing material, and had been arrested, and was\r\noperating under assumed names, had been known, had been in the file\r\nat the time the application for a passport to go to Mexico and other\r\ncountries had been made, would that have been of any significance?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In determining whether or not a passport should be\r\nissued?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir; very definitely. If those reports had reached us\r\nprior to the passport application we certainly would have put a card in\r\nthe file.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it seems to me that if they had come to the\r\nPassport Office we would have advised the Bureau of Security and\r\nConsular Affairs that this had become a Cuban case. These are handled\r\nby Mr. Schwartz personally.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know when the report from the FBI concerning\r\nOswald's activities in New Orleans in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee\r\nreached the State Department rather than the Passport Division?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. When it reached the Department, I don't know. I think\r\nmaybe Mr. Ehrlich might know.\r\n\r\nMr. EHRLICH. I will look to see if I have it.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I have the dates of them.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Will you give the date?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The date of the reports?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The date when it was sent, when it was received.\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The reports were dated October 31, 1963, and October 25,\r\n1963, and they were logged into the Passport Office on November 20,\r\n1963, and November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All of those dates are after the date of the issuance\r\nof the passport?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have just one more thing I want to inquire about.\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with the--were you the Chief of the Passport Division\r\nat the time Oswald returned from Russia to the United States?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who was empowered to issue passports in Moscow to\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Well, it was the consul, but he would not issue a passport\r\nor, in this particular case even limit the passport for return to the\r\nUnited States, without clearance from our office.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Then when Oswald made his application to return to the\r\nUnited States and to secure a passport to return to the United States,\r\nthat application had to be cleared by the division, your division, in\r\nWashington?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you make the determination as to whether the\r\npassport should be issued to him?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. I personally did not. This was made by experienced\r\ncitizenship lawyers.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. By whom?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. The decision was made by experienced citizenship lawyers\r\nin the Foreign Operations Division of the Passport Office. It was\r\ndetermined that Oswald had not expatriated himself. He had signed the\r\nnecessary papers and he answered the required questionnaire under oath,\r\nand to the satisfaction of the Passport Office. Both the consul, who\r\nhad an opportunity to talk to Oswald, and the citizenship lawyers, who\r\nhandled the case in the Passport Office, were in agreement that he had\r\nnot expatriated himself.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Those details are in the file in considerable extent.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Senator Cooper, for the record let me note we have\r\nOswald's passport which is Commission Exhibit No. 946 and it states on\r\npage 15 thereof that the passport was renewed on May 24, 1962, and it\r\nexpired on June 24, 1962, and it also stated when Mr. Oswald came into\r\nthe United States on June 13, 1962.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have just two more questions then.\r\n\r\nOne, at the time you issued the passport that Oswald was issued in\r\nNew Orleans to go to Mexico and the other countries there was no\r\nrequirement at that time that a lookout card be fixed to his file as a\r\ndefector?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Whatever decision has been made on that has come since\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. When you say \"defector,\" the answer to that is in the\r\nquestionnaire.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When I say \"defector,\" was there any regulation, I mean\r\nin the Department, which required any special attention to be given to\r\na defector----\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. With regard to the issuance of passports?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. No, sir; and we cannot deny them passports.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. My last question is, is it your statement that at the\r\ntime you issued the passport in Moscow for his return to the United\r\nStates, at the time the passport was issued in New Orleans, 1963, for\r\nhis trip to Mexico and other countries, that there was nothing in the\r\nregulations relevant and nothing in the files which precluded you from\r\nissuing a passport to him?\r\n\r\nMiss KNIGHT. This is my opinion; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. I have no other questions.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nMr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Miss Knight. We appreciate your coming in.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 6:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, June 11, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND HARRIS COULTER\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:45 a.m., on June 11, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald Ford, and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Harris Coulter, interpreter; Leon Jaworski, special\r\ncounsel to the attorney general of Texas; William McKenzie, attorney\r\nfor Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nShall we reswear Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would think her former swearing would be sufficient, Mr.\r\nChief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. You consider yourself under oath, do you, Mrs.\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, we would like to have you tell about the\r\nincident in regard to Mr. Nixon that you have told about since we had\r\nyour last examination. Could you tell us what you know about that\r\nincident, first, when it happened insofar as you can recall?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I am very sorry I didn't mention this before. I prefer\r\nthat you ask me the questions and that will help me to remember what\r\nthere is.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us what Mr. Nixon it is, was it Richard Nixon,\r\nthe former Vice President of the United States that you were referring\r\nto?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I only know one Nixon and I think it was Richard Nixon\r\nwhich it was all about.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you fix the date when this occurrence did happen?\r\nApproximately?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was a weekend before he went to New Orleans and after\r\nthe Walker business I think. But I might be mistaken as to whether or\r\nnot this was a weekend because I am basing this on the fact that my\r\nhusband was home and he wasn't--wasn't always employed and he was at\r\nhome weekdays as well sometimes, so I can't be entirely sure that it\r\nwas a weekend.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you place the place of the various homes you had that\r\nthis happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Neely Street.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At the Neely Street house. Do you know what time of day it\r\noccurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This was in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Just my husband and me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you describe in detail just what happened. Mrs.\r\nOswald, when you are answering the questions will you try to break up\r\nyour answers, and let the interpreter try to translate; I think it\r\nwill be helpful in not having the interpreter have to try to remember\r\neverything of a long answer. Do you understand me?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I suggest also, Mr. Rankin, that I think it would\r\nbe preferable that the record be in the first person, that is, the\r\ninterpreter translate just as she said it.\r\n\r\nI was looking over the earlier record and that is the way it was over\r\nthe earlier record and it went quite well.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was early in the morning and my husband went out to get\r\na newspaper, then he came in and sat reading the newspaper. I didn't\r\npay any attention to him because I was occupied with the housework.\r\n\r\nThen he got dressed and put on a good suit. I saw that he took a\r\npistol. I asked him where he was going, and why he was getting\r\ndressed. He answered, \"Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.\"\r\nI said, \"I know how you look,\" or rather, \"I know how you customarily\r\nlook, how you customarily take a look,\" because I saw he was taking the\r\npistol with him rather than I know how you look in the sense that you\r\nare dressed, how you look at things is what I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had it come to your attention, Mrs. Oswald, that Mr. Nixon\r\nwas going to be in Dallas prior to that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; it did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had you seen anything in the newspapers or heard anything\r\nover the radio or television?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; we didn't have TV. I didn't see this in the newspaper.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know what newspaper it was in which your husband\r\nread this report?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; Dallas Morning News maybe. It was a morning paper.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether there was any information at all in the\r\npapers about Mr. Nixon planning to come to Dallas about that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I didn't ever read the newspaper and I did not know;\r\ntherefore, didn't know whether there was any information in the\r\nnewspapers prior to this time about Vice President Nixon's arrival in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could we establish the date more precisely, either\r\nby the newspapers or by testimony from Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\n(At this point, the Chief Justice left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, can you help us by telling how many days it\r\nwas before you went to New Orleans that this incident occurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. What day did I go to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall that your husband went to New Orleans on\r\nApril 24?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. April 24? My husband?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; and you went at a later date with Mrs. Paine, do you\r\nremember that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I remember it was about 2 weeks before.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Two weeks before April 24?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; but when was the incident with Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. April 10 was the Walker incident. Does that help you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is a short distance, you know, I think maybe----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So you think it had to be sometime between April 10 and\r\nApril 24?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This may be 10 days or more. I think it was closer to the\r\ntime when my husband left for New Orleans than it was to the incident\r\nof General Walker. I think it was less than a week before my husband\r\nleft for New Orleans. I did not think up this incident with Nixon\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you mean by that, Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I had forgotten entirely about the incident with Vice\r\nPresident Nixon when I was here the first time. When you asked me the\r\nquestions about it, then I remembered it. I wasn't trying to deceive\r\nyou the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did your husband say that day about Richard Nixon,\r\nwhen he got this gun and dressed up. Did he tell you anything about him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I just didn't know what to do, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you know he was interested in doing something about\r\nMr. Nixon at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. My husband just said that Nixon is coming to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. First I didn't know what to do. I wanted to prevent him\r\nfrom going out.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I\r\nwanted to prevent him and then I started to cry. And I told him that he\r\nshouldn't do this, that he had promised me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you referring to his promise to you that you described\r\nin your prior testimony after the Walker incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; that was the promise.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall the bathroom, how the door closes? Does it\r\nclose into the bathroom on Neely Street or from the outside in?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember now. I don't remember. I only remember\r\nthat it was something to do with the bathroom.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you lock him into the bathroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I can't remember precisely.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall how the locks were on the bathroom door there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I can't recall. We had several apartments and I might be\r\nconfusing one apartment with the other.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is it your testimony that you made it impossible for him to\r\nget out if he wanted to?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he try to get out of the bathroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for\r\nseveral minutes and then he quieted down. I remember that I told him\r\nthat if he goes out it would be better for him to kill me than to go\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He is quite a big man and you are a small woman.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; he is not a big man. He is not strong.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Well, he was 5 feet 9, and you are how tall?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When he is very upset, my husband is very upset he is not\r\nstrong and when I want to and when I collect all my forces and want to\r\ndo something very badly I am stronger than he is.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You meant mentally or physically?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I am not strong but, you know, there is a certain balance\r\nof forces between us.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you think it was persuasion, your persuasion of him or\r\nthe physical force or both that prevented him from going?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't think it was physically, physical prevention\r\nbecause if he--I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted\r\nto. It might have been that he was just trying to test me. He was the\r\nkind of person who could try and wound somebody in that way. Possibly\r\nhe didn't want to go out at all but was just doing this all as a sort\r\nof joke, not really as a joke but rather to simply wound me, to make me\r\nfeel bad.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, if I may interpose here for a moment. Mrs.\r\nOswald has been interrogated at length by the FBI in connection with\r\nthis particular incident--the Nixon incident. I feel confident that the\r\nFBI has made a written report insofar as her testimony is concerned in\r\ntheir interrogation, but for purposes of the record I have no objection\r\nwhatsoever for the FBI report to be included in the record as part of\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you, Mr. McKenzie. We will incorporate those reports\r\nas a part of the record in regard to this incident, if that is\r\nagreeable to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. The reason I say that is because of the fact that those\r\ninterrogations were conducted at an earlier date and closer to the\r\nactual incident, the state of time to the actual incidents than her\r\ninterrogation here today, and insofar as dates are concerned I think\r\nthat her mind would be clearer on those dates, and I likewise know that\r\nat that time a Russian interpreter was there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McKenzie, I think with the members of the Commission\r\nhere that I want to ask a number of questions about this incident\r\nbecause of its importance so they can observe the witness as well as\r\nhave the benefit of her testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, in no way am I suggesting otherwise but if it\r\nwould help the Commission in evaluating her testimony and evaluating\r\nthe evidence that it has had heretofore in prior testimony we have no\r\nobjection to those reports being a part of the record in any way.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I might be mistaken about some of the details of this\r\nincident but it is very definite he got dressed, took a gun, and then\r\ndidn't go out. The reason why there might be some confusion in my mind\r\nabout the details because it happened in other apartments in which we\r\nlived that we quarreled and then I would shut him in the bathroom, and\r\nin this particular case it may not have happened quite that way, but\r\nthere is no doubt that he got dressed and had a gun.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember what you said to him and what he said to\r\nyou at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember now but I told the FBI precisely.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And were your reports to the FBI in regard to this incident\r\naccurate, truthful, and correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. They were correct as far as I could remember. The only\r\ndetail as far as my memory served me--the only detail which might be\r\nconfused is the one with the bathroom.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had your husband said anything before or did he say\r\nanything at that time in regard to Mr. Nixon showing any hostility,\r\nfriendship, or anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Showing any hostility or friendship toward Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; toward Nixon.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember him saying anything--I don't remember but\r\nhe didn't tell me. I don't remember him saying anything of that sort. I\r\nonly remember the next day he told me that Nixon did not come. Excuse\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The FBI suggested that possibly I was confused between\r\nJohnson and Nixon but there is no question that in this incident it was\r\na question of Mr. Nixon. I remember distinctly the name Nixon because\r\nI read from the presidential elections that there was a choice between\r\nPresident Kennedy and Mr. Nixon.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where did your husband get the pistol that\r\nmorning; do you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. What, where?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. My husband had a small room where he kept all that sort of\r\nthing. It is a little larger than a closet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you see him go in and get the pistol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I didn't see him go into the room. I only saw him standing\r\nbefore the open door and putting the pistol in his pocket.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you recall which pocket he put the pistol in?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was not in a pocket. He put it in his belt.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had you and your husband ever discussed Mr. Nixon at a\r\nprevious, at any previous time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What else happened about this incident beyond what you have\r\ntold us?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He took off his suit and stayed home all day reading a\r\nbook. He gave me the pistol and I hid it under the mattress.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say anything more than you have told us to him\r\nabout this matter at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I closed the front door to the building that day and when\r\nwe were quarreling about--when we were struggling over the question of\r\nwhether or not he should go out I said a great deal to him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to him then?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Just tell us in substance?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I really don't remember now. I only remember that I told\r\nhim that I am sorry of all these pranks of his and especially after the\r\none with General Walker, and he had promised me, I told him that he had\r\npromised me----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything in answer to that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As I recall, in your previous testimony there was some\r\nindication that you had said that if he did the Walker type of thing\r\nagain you would notify the authorities. Did that conversation come up\r\nat this time with your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I said that. But he didn't go at that time and after\r\nall he was my husband.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Does--do you mean you said it again at the time of the\r\nNixon incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I told him that but you must understand that I don't\r\nspeak English very well, and for that reason I used to keep a piece of\r\npaper with me, and I had it, you know, what piece of paper I am talking\r\nabout. At that time I didn't know how to go in police station: I don't\r\nknow where it was.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Was that the passport?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. After the incident with Walker----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that paper the Walker incident note that you have\r\ndescribed in your testimony?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you put the pistol under the mattress, what\r\nhappened to the pistol from then on?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That evening he asked for it and said that nothing was\r\ngoing to happen, and that he said he wouldn't do anything and took the\r\npistol back. And put it into his room.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you keep the, what you call, the Walker note with you\r\nall the time or did you have it in a particular place where you could\r\ngo and get it and show it to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I had it all the time. I kept it in a certain place\r\ninitially and then I put it in the pages of a book.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Rankin, would you ask the witness to state again\r\nwhat Lee Oswald's promise was to her that he had made at the time of\r\nthe Walker incident?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you relate the promise that your husband made to you\r\nright after the discovery of the Walker incident by you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This wasn't a written promise.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. But in words it was more or less that I told him that\r\nhe was very lucky that he hadn't killed--it very good that he hadn't\r\nkilled General Walker. I said it was fate that--it was fated that\r\nGeneral Walker not be killed and therefore he shouldn't try such a\r\nthing again.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did he say in answer to that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He said perhaps I am right. I myself didn't believe what\r\nI was saying because I didn't believe that he was fated. I was just\r\ntrying to find some way of dissuading my husband to do such a thing\r\nagain. Do you understand what I mean?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes. Did he say that he would or would not do that again,\r\nthat is what I want to know.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. At the time I did definitely convince him that I was\r\nright, and at the time he said that he would not do such a thing again.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, when you talked to him about the Nixon incident and\r\npersuaded him not to go out and do anything to Mr. Nixon, did you say\r\nanything about your pregnancy in trying to persuade him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I told him that I was pregnant.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you observe his action at the time of this Nixon\r\nincident, how he acted?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. How he reacted to this?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How he reacted to your interfering with him.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. At first he was extremely angry, and he said, \"You are\r\nalways getting in my way.\" But then rather quickly he gave in, which\r\nwas rather unusual for him. At the time I didn't give this any thought,\r\nbut now I think it was just rather a kind of nasty joke he was playing\r\nwith me. Sometimes Lee was--he had a sadistic--my husband had a\r\nsadistic streak in him and he got pleasure out of harming people, and\r\nout of harming me, not physically but emotionally and mentally.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you told us substantially all that happened about this\r\nNixon incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That is all I can remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you tell us why you didn't mention this\r\nincident to the Commission when you appeared before?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There were an awful lot of questions at that time, and\r\nI was very tired and felt that I had told everything and I don't\r\nremember, I can't understand why I didn't mention this. It would have\r\nbeen better for me to mention it the first time than to make you all do\r\nmore work on it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At the time of this incident did you threaten to go to the\r\nauthorities in case your husband did not desist in his intention?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I said that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I may have to go--could I ask a few questions? Mrs.\r\nOswald, will you repeat what your husband said that morning when he\r\ndressed and got the pistol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I asked him where he was going and why he was getting\r\ndressed. He answered. \"Today Nixon is coming and I want to go out and\r\nhave a look at him.\"\r\n\r\nI answered, \"I know how you look,\" and I had in mind the fact that he\r\nwas taking a pistol with him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he say anything about what he intended to do with\r\nthe pistol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ask him if he intended to use the pistol\r\nagainst Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I told him that, \"You have already promised me not to play\r\nany more with that thing.\" Not really play, but, you know--I didn't\r\nmean, of course, just playing but using the pistol. Then he said,\r\n\"I am going to go out and find out if there will be an appropriate\r\nopportunity and if there is I will use the pistol.\" I just remembered\r\nthis and maybe I didn't say this in my first testimony and now it just\r\nhas occurred to me that he said this.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did your husband say why he wanted to use the pistol\r\nagainst Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he say where he intended to see Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He didn't say. He just said in Dallas, and since Nixon was\r\ncoming to Dallas.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When he was talking to you about seeing Mr. Nixon and\r\nusing the pistol, what was his attitude? Was he angry or----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He wasn't angry. He looked more preoccupied and had sort\r\nof a concentrated look.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, from the beginning, from the time that he first\r\ntold you that he was going to use the pistol, until the time that you\r\nsay he became quieted, did he again make any statement about using the\r\npistol against Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I told him that I didn't want him to use his gun any more.\r\nHe said, \"I will go out and have a look and perhaps I won't use my\r\ngun, but if there is a convenient opportunity perhaps I will.\" Strike\r\n\"perhaps\" please from that last sentence. I didn't have a lot of time\r\nto think of what we were actually saying. All I was trying to do was to\r\nprevent him from going out.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. How much time elapsed, if you can remember, from the\r\ntime he first told you that he was going out and when he finally became\r\npacified?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This was maybe 30 minutes. The whole incident took maybe\r\n20 minutes. It was about 10 minutes I took--15 minutes maybe. 15\r\nminutes, it took maybe 10 minutes for him to be prepared to go out and\r\nthen the incident in the bathroom took maybe 5 minutes until he quieted\r\ndown. It doesn't mean I held him in the bathroom for 5 minutes because\r\nI couldn't do that but the general discussion in the bathroom.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You said he stayed at the house the remainder of the\r\nday. During the remainder of the day did you discuss again with him the\r\nincident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; no.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he say anything more that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. He read a book.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know what book it was, by chance?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember. It was some kind of book from the public\r\nlibrary. He had a two-volume history of the United States. This is not\r\nfrom the library, this was his own book.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The incident occurred, you said just a few days after he\r\nhad told you he shot at General Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was about 10 or 12 days after the incident with General\r\nWalker, perhaps about 3 days before we left for the departure for New\r\nOrleans. This didn't happen right after the incident with General\r\nWalker. It happened rather closer to a time when we departed for New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The General Walker incident made a very strong impression\r\non you, didn't it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Of course. I never thought that Lee had a gun in order to\r\nuse it to shoot at somebody with.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Didn't this statement that he made about Vice President\r\nNixon make a strong impression on you also?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know. I was pregnant at the time. I had a lot of\r\nother things to worry about. I was getting pretty well tired of all of\r\nthese escapades of his.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was there any reason why you didn't tell the Commission\r\nabout this when you testified before?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I had no--there is no particular reason. I just forgot.\r\nVery likely this incident didn't make a very great impression on me at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Now, before the death of President Kennedy, of course, you\r\nknew that your husband had purchased a rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You knew that he had purchased a pistol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And a knife?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; what kind of knife?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he have a knife?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He had a little pocket knife; I think.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You knew that he had told you that he had tried to kill\r\nGeneral Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And, of course, as you said you heard him make a threat\r\nagainst Nixon.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you have some fear that he would use these weapons\r\nagainst someone else?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Of course; I was afraid.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Of course; I was afraid.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You thought that he might use his weapons against someone?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. After the incident with Nixon I stopped believing him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You what?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I stopped believing him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Why?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Because he wasn't obeying me any longer, because he\r\npromised and then he broke his promise.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you repeat that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Because he wasn't obeying me any more. He promised and, he\r\nmade a promise and then he broke it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is my question. Having been told that--isn't it\r\ncorrect he told you that he shot at General Walker? He made a promise\r\nto you that he wouldn't do anything like that again, you heard him\r\nthreaten Vice President Nixon, didn't it occur to you then that there\r\nwas danger that he would use these weapons against someone else in the\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. After the incident with Walker, I believed him when he\r\ntold me that he wouldn't use the weapons any longer.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I remember you testified before and I asked you if you had\r\nheard him threaten any official or other person and your answer was no.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Because I forgot at that time about the incident with\r\nNixon.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I want to ask you again: In view of the fact that you\r\nknew--in view of the fact that he had threatened Walker by shooting\r\nat him, and he threatened Vice President Nixon can you not tell this\r\nCommission whether after that he threatened to hurt, harm any other\r\nperson?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Nobody else. Perhaps I should be punished for not having\r\nsaid anything about all this, but I was just a wife and I was trying to\r\nkeep the family together, at that time. I mean to say. I am talking, of\r\ncourse, of the time before President Kennedy's death. And if I forget\r\nto say anything now, I am not doing it on purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am just asking questions. Will you say here that he never\r\ndid make any statement against President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he ever make any statement about him of any kind?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to read and translate articles from the newspaper\r\nabout Kennedy to me and from magazines, favorable articles about\r\nKennedy. He never commented on them and he never discussed them in any\r\nway but because of his translations and his reading to me he always\r\nhad a favorable feeling about President Kennedy because he always read\r\nthese favorably inclined articles to me. He never said that these\r\narticles never were true that he was a bad President or anything like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I didn't catch the last.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He never said these articles were not true or that\r\nPresident Kennedy was a bad President or anything like that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you testified before that he made statements\r\nshowing his dislike of our system of government and its economic system.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to complain about the educational difficulties and\r\nabout the unemployment in the United States and about the high cost of\r\nmedical care.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Right there, please, may I, Mr. Dulles when did he\r\ncomplain of those things, was this in Russia or was it in the United\r\nStates after you returned from Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. After our return from Russia. When we were living in New\r\nOrleans after returning from Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did he likewise make such complaints about the American\r\nsystem while you were living in Russia after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to tell me that it was difficult to find a job and\r\nto get work in the United States but nonetheless we would be better\r\nthere than we were in Russia. Excuse me. He was the kind of person who\r\nwas never able to get along anywhere he was and when he was in Russia\r\nhe used to say good things about the United States and when he was in\r\nthe United States he used to talk well about Russia.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You knew, of course, because of the incidents in New\r\nOrleans that he did not like American policy respecting Cuba.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He was definitely a supporter of Cuba. This was something\r\nwhich remained with him from Russia.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he ever say to you who was responsible or who had\r\nsome responsibility for our policy toward Cuba?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Had he ever mentioned President Kennedy in connection\r\nwith our Cuban policy?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Never to me.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he ever say anything----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He might have discussed this with Paine.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. With who?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Mr. Paine, husband of Ruth Paine.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He might have done what now?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. With the husband of Ruth Paine.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Why do you say that, did you ever hear him talking\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to talk politics with Mr. Paine. I don't know\r\nwhat they were talking about because at that time I didn't understand\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you mean, though, to say that you believed he might\r\nhave discussed the Cuban policy with Mr. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; especially after we returned from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Why? Why do you make that statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Because we only saw Mr. Paine once or twice before we went\r\nto New Orleans. And there was more opportunity to see Mr. Paine after\r\nwe came back.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But my question is what makes you think he might have\r\ntalked to Mr. Paine about Cuba?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think, sir; because after returning from New Orleans\r\nthis was his favorite subject, Cuba, and he was quite--a little bit\r\ncracked about it, crazy about Cuba.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You mean he talked to you a great deal about it after\r\nyou came from New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Well, in New Orleans he used to talk to me endlessly about\r\nCuba, but after we came back he didn't talk to me about it any longer\r\nbecause I was just sick and tired of this.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. \"He\" in this case is your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That is right. I really don't know about what he talked\r\nwith Mr. Paine. I think that they were talking about politics, that is\r\nto say my husband with Mr. Paine because my husband used to tell me\r\nafterwards, \"Well, he doesn't understand anything about politics.\" \"He\r\nis not too strong on politics.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, I think they were probably talking with the American\r\npolitical system and the Russian political system and comparisons\r\nbetween them. I think that Mr. Paine could probably tell you more about\r\nthis than I can.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all I want to ask for the time being.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think that Mr. Paine knows more about my husband's\r\npolitical attitudes toward the United States than I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said the FBI asked you whether you could have been\r\nmistaken about it being Mr. Nixon that your husband was interested in\r\ngoing and seeing and maybe doing something to with his gun.\r\n\r\nDo you know what Mr. Johnson you were asking about?\r\n\r\nLet me rephrase the question.\r\n\r\nYou said the FBI asked you whether you might have been mistaken about\r\nMr. Nixon and whether it might have been Mr. Johnson instead of Mr.\r\nNixon that your husband was interested in doing something to with his\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nDo you know what Mr. Johnson was being referred to?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I didn't know who Johnson was. I am ashamed but I\r\nnever knew his name. I am ashamed myself but I didn't know who Johnson\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You didn't know that the FBI was asking about the then Vice\r\nPresident and now President Johnson?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I never heard of Johnson before he became President.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you are quite sure----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Maybe I am stupid, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you are quite sure that your husband mentioned the name\r\nof Nixon to you----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I am sure it was Nixon.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That morning?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether this Nixon incident occurred the day\r\nbefore your husband went to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It wasn't the day before. Perhaps 3 days before.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, may I ask a question?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mrs. Oswald, you say or you said a few minutes ago that\r\nMr. Paine knew or knows more about your husband's attitude about the\r\nUnited States than you do. Why did you say that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Because my husband's favorite topic of discussion was\r\npolitics, and whoever he was with he talked to them politics and Mr.\r\nPaine was with him a fair amount and I am not sure they talked about\r\npolitics. They went to meetings of some kind together, I don't know\r\nwhat kind of meetings.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Do you know where the meetings were?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In Dallas. After they came back from some meeting my\r\nhusband said to me something about Walker being at this meeting, and\r\nhe said, \"Paine knows that I shot him.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know whether this was the truth or not. I don't know whether it\r\nwas true or not but this is what he told me.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Would they go in Mr. Paine's automobile?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; it was about 2 days after this incident with\r\nStevenson or the next day, or maybe it was the same place, or the next\r\nday that a meeting was held where General Walker appeared.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. It was the day before.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The day before? The day after. I think there was 1 day's\r\ndifference between them, either it was the day before or the day after.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say that there were a number of political\r\nmeetings----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Excuse me; but I think this was on Friday. I think that\r\nLee was at this meeting on a Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you say there were a number of political meetings that\r\nyour husband went to----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Excuse me; this was October 24.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. With Mr. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. A week after his birthday--this was Friday. I think it was\r\na week after my husband's birthday about October 24 or something like\r\nthat or the 25th.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Reporter, can you give her the question that I asked?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Excuse me, please.\r\n\r\n(The question was read by the reporter.)\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I only know about this one.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did the FBI tell you that the reason they were asking about\r\nwhether there was a mistake as to whether it was Mr. Nixon or Vice\r\nPresident Johnson was because there was a report in Dallas papers about\r\nVice President Johnson going to Dallas around the 23d of April?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; they did tell me this. They said that at this time\r\nthere was only one announcement in the newspapers of anyone coming and\r\nthat was Vice President Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But you still are certain it was Mr. Nixon and not Vice\r\nPresident Johnson?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes, no. I am getting a little confused with so many\r\nquestions. I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and now after all\r\nthese questions I wonder if I am right in my mind.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did your husband----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I never heard about Johnson. I never heard about Johnson.\r\nI never knew anything about Johnson. I just don't think it was Johnson.\r\nI didn't know his name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you husband during the Nixon incident say Mr. Nixon's\r\nname several times or how many times.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only once.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, you said that your husband went to get the pistol in\r\nthe room. Will you tell us what room that was that he went to get the\r\npistol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was a small sort of storeroom. Just to the left off the\r\nbalcony as you come in; it is just on the left from the balcony.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was it out, was the pistol out in the room or was it in a\r\ncloset?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This room contained only a table and some shelves, and the\r\npistol was not on the table. It was hidden somewhere on a shelf.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was the rifle in that room, too?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where was the rifle in the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Sometimes it was in the corner, sometimes it was up on a\r\nshelf. Lee didn't like me to go into this room. That is why he kept it\r\nclosed all the time and told me not to go into it. Sometimes he went in\r\nthere and sat by himself for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By closed, do you mean locked?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to close it from the inside. I don't remember what\r\nkind of lock it was. Possibly it was just a--some kind of a tongue----\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Latch.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Latch or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How could he close it from the inside and then get out?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When he was inside he could close it from the inside so\r\nthat I couldn't come in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But when he came out could he close it from the outside so\r\nthat you could not get in?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; from the outside it couldn't be locked.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you went to New Orleans and packed for the\r\ntrip to New Orleans, did you help to pack the pistol or the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No, no; Lee never let me pack things when we went for\r\ntrips. He always did it himself.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you see him pack the pistol or the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you know the pistol and the rifle were in the\r\nluggage going to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I stayed for some time with Ruth Paine after he left for\r\nNew Orleans and I don't know whether they were in his things or they\r\nwere in the stuff which was left with me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the time Mrs. Paine picked you up to go to the\r\nbus station, did you intend to go by bus to New Orleans at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While you were living on Neely Street you didn't\r\ntell us before of any extensive rifle shooting at Love Field or rifle\r\npractice at Love Field. Can you tell us more about it now?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Lee didn't tell me when he was going out to practice. I\r\nonly remember one time distinctly that he went out because he took the\r\nbus. I don't know if he went to Love Field at that time. I don't--after\r\nall this testimony, after all this testimony, when I was asked did he\r\nclean his gun a lot, and I answered yes, I came to the conclusion that\r\nhe was practicing with his gun because he was cleaning it afterwards.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he take the rifle and the pistol to Love Field\r\nor at the time he went on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Just a minute. Let me ask her a question. May I ask a\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Representative Ford, I wasn't here as you know when Mrs.\r\nOswald testified before. I have been with her when she was interrogated\r\nby the FBI relative to practicing the rifle shooting. This is the first\r\ntime that I have heard the use of the words \"Love Field.\" Has there\r\nbeen prior testimony by Mrs. Oswald here that he was practicing at Love\r\nField, because the reason I ask this is because she has steadfastly\r\nin the past told me and the FBI that she didn't know where he went to\r\npractice and that is the reason I wanted to know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The record is----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know where he practiced. I just think that the bus\r\ngoes to, went to Love Field.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Her testimony before was that the bus that he took, that\r\nshe knows about when he went, was a bus that went to Love Field, and\r\nshe thought he went to some place in that area to do his practicing.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. The reason I ask the question, Mr. Rankin, is because\r\nI don't believe there is any practice area at Love Field for rifle\r\npracticing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well, the investigation that the Commission has made shows\r\nthat there is a place near Love Field where people do shooting and\r\npracticing.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Not at Love Field.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It is right adjacent, in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Once we went out with Kathy Ford with the children to\r\nwatch airplanes landing and these airplanes made a tremendous noise\r\nand for that reason I thought that maybe my husband was practicing\r\nsomewhere in that area because you couldn't hear the sound of shots.\r\nI don't know if there is any place near there where one can practice\r\nshooting, though. This idea just came to me a little while ago when we\r\nwere out there, watching the airplanes because it was a couple of weeks\r\nago that this happened. Just sort of a guess of mine.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How did he pack the gun or conceal the gun when he went out\r\non the bus toward Love Field?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Are you talking about the gun or the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am talking about the rifle.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He used to wrap it up in his overcoat, raincoat.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So that the record will be clear on this, Mr. McKenzie, the\r\nprior testimony did not purport to indicate that Mrs. Oswald thought\r\nhe was practicing right on Love Field where the airplanes were landing\r\nor anything like that. It was that he took that bus and took the rifle\r\nand came back with the rifle and that the bus went to Love Field and\r\nthe investigation has shown that there is at least one place in that\r\nimmediate neighborhood where there is gun practice carried on.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there testimony, Mr. Rankin, as to more than one trip or\r\nshould we get that from the witness?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. She testified right now she only knew of this one although\r\nshe knew of his cleaning his guns a number of times. She just testified\r\nto that. Do you want more than that?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I thought the record was a little fuzzy. Maybe you should\r\nclarify it.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I think you should ask the question.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us, Mrs. Oswald, how you thought your husband\r\nmight have been practicing in the area near Love Field or how you\r\nconcluded that he might have been practicing with the rifle in the area\r\nnear Love Field.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only because that is the bus, only because that is where\r\nthe bus goes. He never told me where.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you don't know whether he was practicing at a place\r\nnear Love Field or some place between where he got on the bus near your\r\nhome and Love Field; is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I don't know, even now I don't know where it is.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can I just ask a question? Do you know how many times\r\nhe took the rifle from your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You are speaking of Neely Street.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I only saw----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you were living on Neely Street--strike that. You\r\nhave told about his taking the rifle from the house on Neely Street and\r\nthen later cleaning the rifle. Do you know how many times that occurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I saw him take the rifle only once when we were living\r\non Neely Street but he cleaned the rifle perhaps three or four times,\r\nperhaps three times--three times.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he ever tell you that he was practicing with a\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only after I saw him take the gun that one time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ask him if he had been practicing with the\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes, I asked him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He said yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he ever give any reason why he was practicing with\r\nthe rifle to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He didn't give me a reason. He just said that for a man it\r\nis an interesting thing to have a rifle. I considered this some kind of\r\na sport for him. I didn't think he was planning to employ it. I didn't\r\ntake it seriously.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At the time of the Nixon incident did you know who Mr.\r\nNixon was?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I didn't know what position he held. I thought he was Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever check to see whether Mr. Nixon was in fact in\r\nDallas anytime around that date?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After the day of the Nixon incident did you ever discuss\r\nthat incident again with your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did the Nixon incident have anything to do with your\r\ndecision to go to New Orleans to live?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. After the incident with Walker it became clear to me that\r\nit would be a good idea to go away from Dallas and after the incident\r\nwith Nixon insisted--I insisted on it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After the Nixon incident did you ever discuss that Nixon\r\nincident again with your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. I don't know why. Perhaps it didn't make a very strong\r\nimpression on me and that is why I didn't mention it in my first\r\ntestimony. Perhaps it is because the first incident with Walker made\r\nsuch a strong impression that what happened afterward was somewhat\r\neffaced by it. I was so much upset by this incident with General Walker\r\nthat I only just wanted to get away from Dallas as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss the Nixon incident with anyone other than\r\nyour husband before the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever consider telling the police about the Walker\r\nand Nixon incidents?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I thought of this but then Lee was the only person who was\r\nsupporting me in the United States, you see. I didn't have any friends,\r\nI didn't speak any English and I couldn't work and I didn't know what\r\nwould happen if they locked him up and I didn't know what would happen\r\nto us. Of course, my reason told me that I should do it but because of\r\ncircumstances I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When did you first tell something about the Nixon incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was after the assassination; we were in Martin's house\r\nand I think Robert was there also. That is when I first mentioned that.\r\nI don't remember whether I told them both at the same time or told\r\nMartin first and Robert second or Robert first and Martin second.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know about when that was with reference to the time\r\nyou moved in with the Martins?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think it was in the first month. I don't remember which\r\nday it was, though.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall whether you first told Robert about it some\r\ntime in January of this year?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think it was earlier than that, early in December.\r\nPerhaps in the beginning of January, but I think it was before New\r\nYear's.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If Robert has stated that it was on a Sunday, January 12 of\r\nthis year, do you think he is in error then?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't think that Robert would make a mistake. I might\r\nmake a mistake myself but I don't think he would make a mistake because\r\nhe doesn't have quite as many, because he has not been in contact\r\nwith quite as many of these events and doesn't have quite as much to\r\nremember as I have. And in general, I have a bad memory for figures.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you discuss the Nixon incident at anytime with Mr.\r\nThorne or Mr. Martin, your agent?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I told Martin about it but I don't think I told Thorne\r\nabout it, and if Thorne learned about it it must have been from Martin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You just related how you told Mr. Martin about it and the\r\noccasion in your testimony a moment ago; is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I am certain that these were the circumstances in which I\r\ntold Martin about this. Whether or not the--it's possible I was just\r\ntalking with Martin and his wife about Lee and it just came into my\r\nmind and I don't remember whether Robert was there or not, or whether I\r\ntold Robert later.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did anyone at anytime advise you or tell you not to tell\r\nthe Commission about this incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Martin told me that it is not necessary to mention this.\r\nBut when they were asking me here in the Commission whether I had\r\nanything to add to my testimony, I really forgot about it. When Martin\r\nand I were talking about it he said, \"Well, try not to think about\r\nthese things too much.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about why it wasn't necessary to tell\r\nabout this incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember. I don't think he told me why. Maybe\r\nhe told me and I just didn't understand because I didn't understand\r\nEnglish very well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you were telling about the Nixon incident you referred\r\nto your husband's sadistic streak. Do you recall that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us a little more about that, how it showed?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Anytime I did something which didn't please him he would\r\nmake me sit down at a table and write letters to the Russian Embassy\r\nstating that I wanted to go back to Russia. He liked to tease me and\r\ntorment me in this way. He knew that this--he just liked to torment\r\nme and upset me and hurt me, and he used to do this especially if I\r\ninterfered in any of his political affairs, in any of his political\r\ndiscussions. He made me several times write such letters.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have just one question: What did you or your husband do\r\nwith these letters that you wrote? Did any of them get mailed or did\r\nthey all get destroyed?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He kept carbons of these letters but he sent the letters\r\noff himself.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To the Russian Embassy?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; he didn't give me any money to buy stamps. I never\r\nhad any pocket money of my own.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But the letters to the Embassy you are referring to are\r\nactual letters and requested--requests--they weren't practice letters\r\nor anything of that kind to punish you, were they?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; they were real letters. I mean if my husband didn't\r\nwant me to live with him any longer and wanted me to go back, I would\r\ngo back, not because I wanted to go back but I didn't have any choice.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I misunderstood you then because I thought you were\r\ndescribing the fact that he made you write letters as a part of this\r\nsadistic streak that would never be sent but what he actually did was\r\nhave you prepare the letters and then he proceeded to send them, is\r\nthat your testimony?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He did send them and he really wanted this. He knew that\r\nthis hurt me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Those are the letters to the Russian Embassy we have\r\nintroduced in evidence in connection with your testimony; is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; those are the letters.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he ever show you replies to those letters?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. At first--yes; there were. At first I didn't believe that\r\nhe was sending off those letters.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you did see the replies?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I received answers from the embassy.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, I will turn to another subject, Mrs. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you like to have a 5-minute recess? We will proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, Mrs. Oswald, I would like to ask you about the Irving\r\nGun Shop in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The what? I don't know anything about this at all.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Your counsel tells me I should correct that, that Irving\r\nis not a part of Dallas. It is the city of Irving. A witness has said\r\nthat you and your two children and your husband came into a furniture\r\nshop asking the location of a gunshop in that area in Irving, and after\r\nappearing there that you and your husband, with your husband driving\r\nthe car, along with your two children, got in the car and went up the\r\nstreet in the direction of where the gunshop was. Did you recall any\r\nincident of that kind?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is just a complete fabrication. Lee never drove a car\r\nwith me. Only Ruth Paine drove a car with me. And I never took my baby\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever go into such a furniture store in Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That you recall?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I was only twice in a store in Irving where they sell,\r\nlike a cafe, where you can buy something to eat and where they sell\r\ntoys and clothes and things like that; a little bit like a Woolworths,\r\na one-story shop but without any furniture in it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know a Mrs. Whitworth who works in a furniture store\r\nin Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I was never in Irving in any furniture store.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know a Mrs. Whitworth?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It is the first time I have ever heard that name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know a Mrs. Hunter, a friend of Mrs. Whitworth?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever go on a trip with your husband to have a\r\ntelescopic lens mounted on a gun at a gunshop?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Never. No; this is all not true. In the first place,\r\nmy husband couldn't drive, and I was never alone with him in a car.\r\nAnytime we went in a car it was with Ruth Paine, and there was\r\nnever--we never went to any gun store and never had any telescopic lens\r\nmounted.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did the four of you, that is, your husband, you, and your\r\ntwo children, ever go alone any place in Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In Irving the baby was only 1 month old. I never took her\r\nout anywhere.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever go anytime----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Just to doctor, you know.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever go anytime with your husband in a car\r\nwith the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I was never at anytime in a car with my husband and with\r\na rifle. Not only with the rifle, not even with a pistol. Even without\r\nanything I was never with my husband in a car under circumstances where\r\nhe was driving a car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you go in a car with somebody else driving\r\nwhere your husband had the pistol or the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Never. I don't know what to think about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, I will hand you Commission's Exhibit No. 819\r\nand ask you particularly about the signature at the bottom.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That is Lee's handwriting, and this is mine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were the words \"A. J. Hidell, Chapter President\" on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 819 are in your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell the Commission how you happened to sign that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Lee wrote this down on a piece of paper and told me to\r\nsign it on this card, and said that he would beat me if I didn't sign\r\nthat name on the card.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have any other discussion about your signing that\r\nname?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What discussion did you have?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I said that this sounded like Fidel. I said, \"You have\r\nselected this name because it sounds like Fidel\" and he blushed and\r\nsaid, \"Shut up, it is none of your business.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was there any discussion about who Hidell, as signed on the\r\nbottom of that card, was?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He said that it was his own name and a there is no Hidell\r\nin existence, and I asked him, \"You just have two names,\" and he said,\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was anything else said about that matter at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I taunted him about this and teased about this and said\r\nhow shameful it is that a person who has his own perfectly good name\r\nshould take another name and he said, \"It is none of your business,\r\nI would have to do it this way, people will think I have a big\r\norganization\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ask him why he needed to have the other name in\r\nyour handwriting rather than his own?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I did ask him that and he would answer that in order that\r\npeople will think it is two people involved and not just one.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you ever sign any more such cards with the name\r\n\"Hidell\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only this one.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you never signed the name \"Hidell\" on any other paper\r\nat any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only once.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where did this actual signing take place, Mrs.\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In New Orleans.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In what is the name of the street where we lived, in an\r\napartment house.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In your apartment house?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; in our apartment house.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What time of day, do you recall?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It might have been 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had you ever heard the name \"Hidell\" before?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember whether this was before or after Lee\r\nspoke on the radio. I think it was after.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he use the name Hidell on the radio?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think that he might have when he was talking on the\r\nradio said that Hidell is the President of his organization but, of\r\ncourse, I don't understand English well and I don't know. He spoke on\r\nthe radio using his own name but might have mentioned the name Hidell.\r\nThis is what he told me. When I tried to find out what he said on the\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This might have been on television also?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was on the radio, not on television. He told me that\r\nsomeone had taken movies of him for to be shown later on television but\r\nI don't know if they ever were.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you ever sign the name Hidell at any subsequent time to\r\nany document?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. If you recall signing it. Do you recall signing his name\r\nto any other document?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I only remember this one occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was the way you signed on this Commission's Exhibit No. 819\r\nyour usual way of writing English?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. My English handwriting changes every day, and my Russian\r\nhandwriting, too. But that is more or less my usual style.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You weren't trying to conceal the way you sign anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I tried to do it, I just tried to write it as nicely as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you make some practice runs of writing this name before\r\nyou actually put it on the card?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; because it was difficult for me to write English\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So you mean you wrote it several times on another sheet of\r\npaper and then put it on this card?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there anybody else present at the time of this\r\nincident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; only Lee.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he have you sign only one card?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This was the only time when I--when Lee asked me to do\r\nthis and I did it. I might have signed two or--cards and not just one\r\nbut there weren't a great many.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the other cards have someone else's name\r\nbesides Lee Harvey Oswald on it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; only Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you think you might have signed more than one\r\nsuch card?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Maybe two, three. This is just 1 day when I was signing\r\nthis. It just happened on one occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, turning to another subject, I would like to\r\nask you about some correspondence with the Dallas Civil Liberties\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nDo you recall that they inquired as to whether you were being kept from\r\nseeing and speaking to people against your will?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This letter was translated by Ruth Paine and I answered on\r\nthe basis of the translation.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. May I see those letters, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I didn't want to answer this letter. It was simply a\r\nmatter of courtesy on my part.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, you received a letter from the local chapter of the\r\nCivil Liberties union in Russian, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There was a letter that was in English and there was a\r\ntranslation which came with it, and it was stated that the translation\r\nwas done by Ruth Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you do with the translation or the--I will ask you\r\nthe translation first. Did you keep that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember what I did with it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know what you did with the part that was in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Perhaps it is somewhere among my papers but I didn't pay\r\nany special attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 331 and ask you if\r\nthat is the letter in English that you referred to?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; it is the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I call the Commission's attention to the fact that that has\r\nalready been received in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, did you write Mr. Olds about this? This\r\nappears to be a letter in reply to a letter from you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is right. I asked for it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald, will you examine Commission Exhibits Nos. 990 and 991 and\r\nstate whether you know the handwriting in these exhibits?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is all mine, my handwriting. This is the answer to\r\nthat letter.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the letter, Exhibit No. 990, and the envelope, Exhibit\r\nNo. 991, in your handwriting were your response to the inquiry of the\r\nDallas Civil Liberties Union on the Exhibit No. 331?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; this was my answer to this letter, Exhibit No. 331.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I offer in evidence Commission Exhibits Nos. 990 and 991.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You want them admitted at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 990 and 991 were marked for identification\r\nand received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, I will ask you to examine Exhibit No. 988 and\r\nwith the help of the interpreter, advise us whether or not it is a\r\nreasonably correct translation of your letter, Exhibit No. 990.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is not an accurate translation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, can you tell us what errors were made, where\r\nthe corrections should be to make it a correct translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There is one place here in which it refers to the third\r\nsentence of the English text which states: \"What you read in the papers\r\nis correct.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How would you correct that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is incorrect. A better, a proper translation,\r\nalthough unofficial of this passage, and the Russian text of my letter\r\nwould read, \"Your concern is quite unnecessary although it is quite\r\nunderstandable if one is to judge from what is written in the papers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you proceed with any other corrections?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This, the letter, the spirit of the letter reflects my own\r\nspirit in my own Russian text--although the translation is somewhat\r\ninaccurate and tends to shorten my own text somewhat.\r\n\r\nThere is another inaccuracy which is more important than the others--it\r\nis not more important, the first one is more important--there is\r\nanother which should be called to the Commission's attention.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of the English text reads: \"Please let Mrs. Ruth\r\nPaine know I owe to her much and think of her as one of my best\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nWhereas the letter only states that: \"Of course, consider her my\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, I call your attention to Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 990 and ask you to note the date which appears to be December 7,\r\n1964.\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Civil Liberties Union letter, you will note, was dated\r\nJanuary 6, 1964 which I will hand you so you can examine it. Could you\r\nexplain that discrepancy? You might wish to examine them.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It can't possibly be the 7th of December 1964 because it\r\nhasn't even come yet.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You might wish to examine the envelope, Exhibit No. 991,\r\nthat may help you as to the correct date.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. January 8. I wrote this January 7. It was just my mistake.\r\nI wrote it on January 7 and mailed it on the 8th. I just out of habit\r\nstill writing December.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, may I ask the Commission, on Commission\r\nExhibit No. 988, which purports to be a translation of Mrs. Oswald's\r\nletter to the Dallas Civil Liberties Union, do you know who translated\r\nthis letter or could you tell us who translated the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McKenzie----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. They wrote me that I can answer them in Russian, and which\r\nI did but I haven't any idea who translated my answer.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The Commission Exhibit No. 987 which I will now offer\r\nstates that the translation was handled by Mrs. Ford and later seen by\r\nMrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the exhibit that you now have in your hand, what is\r\nthe number of that?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. This is Commission Exhibit No. 988 in English which\r\npurports to be a translation of Mrs. Oswald's letter to the Dallas\r\nCivil Liberties Union and I am asking does the Commission know who\r\ntranslated the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We were informed by the Dallas Civil Liberties Union in\r\nExhibit No. 987 that the translation was made by Mrs. Ford and later\r\nseen by Mrs. Paine, and I now offer all exhibits together with Exhibit\r\nNo. 987 as part of the testimony of this witness.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The exhibits shall be admitted. Have we the numbers of all\r\nof these exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; the reporter has them.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 987 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, I will hand you the cameras of your----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder before we finish this----\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I would prefer, Mr. Rankin, for the purposes of the\r\nrecord so that the record will be complete, to have a correct English\r\ntranslation of Mrs. Oswald's letter in the record in lieu of Commission\r\nExhibit No. 988.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, if it is agreeable to the Commission, I would\r\nlike to ask counsel to furnish such a translation and we will then make\r\nit the next number, Exhibit No. 992, as a part of this record.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That shall be admitted then as Exhibit No. 992, the other\r\nalready being in the record I think, probably has to stay there\r\nparticularly in view of all this discussion of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you will furnish it.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. You are putting the onus or burden back on me, Mr.\r\nRankin, when the Commission has a fully qualified, I presume, Russian\r\ninterpreter here, and if the Commission would not mind going to the\r\nfurther expense of having the interpretation of the letter made, I\r\nthink it would expedite the Commission's report.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If it is satisfactory to Mr. McKenzie, then, Mr. Chairman,\r\nI would like to ask Mr. Coulter if he would make a translation and\r\nsubmit it to Mr. McKenzie for submission to his client for approval,\r\nand then we will have that marked the Exhibit No. 992 and made part of\r\nthis record.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excellent, that will be admitted as such, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 992.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Thank you, Mr. Rankin and thank you Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 992 was marked for identification and received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, will you examine the cameras of your husband\r\nand tell us which one took the pictures that showed your husband with\r\nthe rifle and the pistol, as you will recall?\r\n\r\nThe pictures I am asking you about are Exhibits Nos. 133-A and 133-B\r\nwhich you recall are the ones that you said in your prior testimony you\r\ntook yourself.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. With one of these cameras.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. This is the first and last time in my life I ever took a\r\nphotograph and it was done with this gray camera.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Rankin, the Commission exhibit numbers of the two\r\ncameras, one is Commission Exhibit No. 136 and one is Commission\r\nExhibit No. 750.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And the gray camera she is referring to, Mr. Rankin, for\r\nthe purpose of the record is Commission Exhibit No. 750, isn't that\r\nright, Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is the gray camera you just said you took pictures\r\nwith, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes. The other camera also belonged to Lee but I don't use\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Turning to another subject now, Mrs. Oswald, while you and\r\nLee Harvey Oswald were at Minsk in the Soviet Union, can you tell us\r\nhow Lee Harvey Oswald spent his leisure time while he was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know how he spent his time before we were married\r\nbut afterwards he was a great lover of classical music and used to go\r\nto concerts a lot, and theaters, and movies, symphony concerts, and we\r\nused to go out on the lakes around Minsk. There are some lakes in the\r\nconfines of Minsk and outside where we used to go.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. While there did he read much?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He didn't read very much because there wasn't a very great\r\nchoice of books in English except the ones on Marxism.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He could, however, read books in Russian, could he not, at\r\nthis time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; but it was a lot of work for him and he really didn't\r\nenjoy it very much. But he did go to Russian films and understood them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he go to the rifle club there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He belonged to a hunters--a club of hunters and had a\r\nrifle but he never went to the practice meetings of this club. He only\r\npaid his membership dues, and I think that he joined this club in order\r\nto be able to acquire a rifle because only apparently members of such\r\nhunting clubs have the right in the Soviet Union to own a rifle. Only\r\nonce did he go out with a group of some of my friends and take his\r\nrifle and try and shoot some game but he didn't catch anything.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he buy the rifle or was it given to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He bought it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did you do with it when you went to the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think he sold it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it a rifle of--much like the one that was used\r\nin the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. All rifles look alike to me.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did it have a telescopic sight on it, Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. But it was similar to the same rifle that he had in the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. It wasn't identical but it might have been similar,\r\nseeing as how they are both single barrel rifles. I don't understand\r\nanything about rifles at all and I really am not qualified to talk\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You mentioned that he went to the rifle club on one\r\noccasion or the hunting club on one occasion with some friends to hunt\r\nsquirrels or rabbits or things of that sort. Did he go to the hunting\r\nclub on other occasions to practice to shoot?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When I first saw the rifle here in the United States I\r\ndidn't pay much attention to it because I thought this was the rifle he\r\nhad brought from Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he practice shooting the rifle in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you see him or observe him cleaning the rifle in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And would he clean the rifle, did he clean it on several\r\noccasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes, several times.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The hunting club that he belonged to, did it have an\r\ninstructor in shooting the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know but there should have been one.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, he had to have a permit to purchase the rifle in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; you can't possess a rifle without a--permission in\r\nthe Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he purchase the rifle from a government agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. You buy these rifles in special stores, but to buy them\r\nyou have to have a paper from the hunting club stating that you have\r\nthe right to buy a rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the authorized government official gave him authority\r\nto buy the gun through the hunting club?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The hunting club issues this permit. He used to clean the\r\nrifle but he never used it. It always hung on the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, will you describe what you were saying off the\r\nrecord in regard to his going out to use the rifle in the country as\r\ndistinguished from using it in the club?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We all went out together in a group of boys and girls in\r\norder to get--to swim a little and to get a suntan. It was a lake which\r\nis just on the edge of town not far from Minsk, and the men had guns,\r\nand they all went out to try to shoot some kind of rabbit or bird or\r\nsomething like that, and the men went off together and I heard several\r\nshots and they came back and they hadn't caught anything so we laughed\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did that happen more than once?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only one such trip. And even that time he didn't want to\r\ntake the gun with him. He took it only because one of my friends was\r\nlaughing at him and said, \"You have a gun hanging here and you never\r\nuse it. Why don't you bring it along and see if you can use it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you and your husband have any friends other than\r\nRussians while you were at Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There were friends. We had some friends from Argentina but\r\nthey didn't come on this excursion with us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have any friends there who were from Cuba?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There were Cuban students studying in Minsk, and this\r\nArgentinian girl had a Cuban boyfriend and possibly Lee met this\r\nboyfriend, this Cuban student, but I never met him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know where the Cuban students were studying, what\r\nparticular school?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. They study in various educational institutions in Minsk,\r\nsome are in the medical institute, others are in the agricultural and\r\nothers are in the polytechnical institute.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you tell us a little more about these Argentinians,\r\nwere they there for educational reasons or what was the reason they\r\nwere there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Excuse me; I am mixed up with Cubans. You talk about\r\nArgentinians?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I asked about Argentinians but I would be glad to have you\r\nadd the Cubans to it, too.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There is agreement between the Cuban Government and the\r\nRussian Government; and the Cuban Government under this agreement sends\r\nCuban students to study in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell from what Lee said, many of these Cuban\r\nstudents were not satisfied with life in the Soviet Union, and this\r\nArgentinian girl told me the same thing. Many of them thought that,\r\nthey were not satisfied with conditions in the Soviet Union and thought\r\nif Castro were to be in power that the conditions in Cuba would become\r\nsimilar to those in the Soviet Union and they were not satisfied with\r\nthis. They said it wasn't worth while carrying out a revolution just to\r\nhave the kind of life that these people in the Soviet Union had.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you have any idea how many Cubans were in\r\nschool in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I heard the figure of 300 but I never knew even a single\r\none.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you be more helpful in the kind of schools\r\nthey went to, what were the schools?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Most of them were in agricultural institutes. Some were\r\nin the institute of foreign languages where they spent a year studying\r\nRussian in order subsequently to go on into some other institute\r\nwhere they could study some more formal subject or some more formal\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. About how old were these students?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. About between 17 and 21.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was your husband absent from you during any protracted\r\nperiod after your marriage, and during your stay in Minsk other than\r\nthe trip I think he took one trip to Moscow without you.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Once I went to Kharkov, and he stayed in Minsk. Other than\r\nthat there were no absences on his part, except, of course, for the\r\ntrip to Moscow. Do you want to talk about the Argentinian students?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; if you have more to say about that.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. These are people who left Poland about 30 years previously\r\nfor Argentina. Then after the second World War the part of Poland where\r\nthey had been living became part of the Soviet Union and the father of\r\nthis family was an engineer and worked in the same factory where Lee\r\nworked, his name was Zieger.\r\n\r\nThey had two daughters born in Argentina, and the wife was very\r\nhomesick for her native country, so they came back and the Soviet\r\nGovernment gave them Soviet citizenship before they got on the boat to\r\ncome back. Then she told us what she had been reading in the newspapers\r\nwas just propaganda and they thought the life was a little better than\r\nwhat they found out what it was when they arrived. Now, they have been\r\nthere 7 or 8 years and they would prefer to go back to Argentina but\r\nthey can't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In connection with your husband's work in the factory\r\ndid he have any indoctrination courses as a part of that in Marxism,\r\nLeninism, or in anything of that kind in connection with his work in\r\nthe factory?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think there are such courses in the factory for party\r\nmembers and for people who want to become party members but Lee never\r\nwent to them. When he was in Russia he didn't like Russian Communists.\r\nHe thought they were all bureaucrats. I don't actually know what he\r\nliked except himself.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether your husband received any special pay\r\nor special funds through the Russian Red Cross or through any other\r\nchannel in addition to his regular pay in the factory?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Before we were married he apparently--he told me he was\r\ngetting some assistance from the Government, but he told me this after\r\nwe were married, and I don't know from whom or in what way he got it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have any idea how much extra he was\r\ngetting over his wages?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know how much it was but he had quite a lot of\r\nmoney in the beginning. Maybe he wrote about this in his diary.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you know how much he was earning each week\r\nwhile he was employed?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In Russia they don't pay for every week. Eighty rubles a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Eighty rubles a month?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Those are the new rubles?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. New rubles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Those were the new rubles, revalued rubles, that is about\r\n$90; is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. $90 or $80.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While you were married did you know of any extra\r\nmoney he was getting?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He didn't receive any--he didn't receive any extra money\r\nwhile we were married, he had a little bit left over from what he was\r\ngetting before, that is all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he handle all of the money that he received or\r\ndid he give you some while you were in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I was working at the same time, and I gave him my salary\r\nand he in turn would give me some money every now and then to buy\r\ngroceries with and that sort of thing, but I didn't ever get any money\r\nfrom his salary.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So the only income that you know about was the\r\nmoney you earned and the money that he earned?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And how much did you earn?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. 45.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 45 rubles a month?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. A month.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There were no other funds, to your knowledge, that\r\nhe received after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He paid all the bills?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes. You didn't have too much bills in Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he take your money, too? What was your rent, do you\r\nrecall at that time, rent of the apartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Seven rubles and 50 cents, kopeks.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was it 7 rubles and 50 kopeks? A week?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. A month; the rent in Russia are usually about 10 percent\r\nof wages a month.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Wages are low, too.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Of course, people who get more, higher wages have bigger\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Rankin, I think, is it all right to adjourn at this\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nWe will reconvene at 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF HARRIS COULTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.\r\n\r\n(Members present at this point: Chief Justice Warren and Representative\r\nFord.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will come to order. You may proceed, Mr.\r\nRankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. McKenzie has asked that we develop\r\nin the record a little bit about the qualifications of Mr. Coulter as\r\nan interpreter, so it would be clear that he is able to translate back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Coulter, I think you should be sworn for this.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you rise and be sworn, please? Do you solemnly\r\nswear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so\r\nhelp you God?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you please state your full name?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Harris Livermore Coulter.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Glen Echo Heights, Md.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have a position in the Government at the present\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Yes; I am an interpreter with the State Department.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you been in that capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. About 3 months.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any special field of foreign languages that you\r\nare working in?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Russian is my best foreign language. I also work in French\r\nand in Yugoslavian.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What training have you had for interpreting or translating\r\nRussian?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Russian language and area studies was my major subject\r\nat Yale University when I was an undergraduate. I also took 4 years\r\nof graduate work at Columbia University in Soviet area studies. In\r\naddition to that, I studied at the University of Moscow for 6 months.\r\nAnd I have been studying Russian since 1950.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us what period of time you studied at the\r\nUniversity of Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I was there from December 19--excuse me--from September\r\n1962 until January 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you been acting as an official interpreter in\r\nGovernment work?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Yes; for the last 3 months I have been.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And will you describe the nature of that activity?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I have been escorting delegations from Yugoslavia both\r\naround the United States and in Washington. I have been working with\r\nFrench delegations here in the State Department. I would have been\r\nworking with Russians if there had been any. There just haven't been\r\nany yet.\r\n\r\nIn July I will be going to Geneva to be an interpreter at the\r\ndisarmament negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nI worked 3 years as simultaneous interpreter at the United Nations, in\r\nRussian and French.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And have all these various activities since you have been\r\nemployed by the Government been as a part of your Government work?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have facility in the reading of the Russian language?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Yes; I read it fluently.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you had any difficulty understanding Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Not in the slightest; no.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will ask you to ask her if she has had any difficulty\r\nunderstanding you.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In the Russian language?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. McKenzie, do you have anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I would like to ask a couple of questions. Mr. Coulter,\r\nprior to your service with the State Department which commenced some 3\r\nmonths ago, where were you employed?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I was unemployed from June 1963 until March 1964. I was in\r\nthe process of being cleared for a Government job at the time.\r\n\r\nI terminated my employment with the United Nations in June 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And you have been cleared for Government security\r\npurposes?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. That is right. The clearance began about August. I had\r\nsome part-time jobs, freelance work, between the dates, but nothing\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. But for a number of years you were an interpreter at the\r\nUnited Nations?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. About 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And then you started getting a security clearance, and\r\nfor the past 3 months you have been employed by the State Department as\r\nan interpreter?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. You were the interpreter present this morning when Mrs.\r\nOswald commenced her testimony on this occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And all the above and foregoing testimony previously\r\ntestified to from the beginning of this session this morning up through\r\nnow, you have interpreted; have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I have.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I appreciate Mr. Coulter helping me.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, the purpose and reason behind my asking\r\nyou to show his qualifications, the interpreter's qualifications, is\r\nthat the record will reflect that Mrs. Oswald was asked questions in\r\nEnglish, and they were interpreted into Russian, and she has answered\r\nin Russian--and so that the record will show she was not answering in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, I would like to turn now to the pictures of\r\nyour husband that I asked you about earlier, when you identified the\r\ngray camera as the one that was used in taking the pictures. And I\r\ncalled your attention to Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A and 133-B. I\r\nnow wish to ask you specifically whether you used that camera that you\r\nsaw identified for the taking of both of these pictures. And in so\r\ndoing, I wish to call your attention to the fact that there were two\r\ndifferent positions in the exhibits.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I took both these pictures at the same time, and with the\r\nsame camera.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And in giving that answer, you have examined the pictures,\r\nand you know they are different positions--that is, your husband\r\nhas the rifle in different positions and the newspaper in different\r\npositions in the two pictures--do you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I am aware of that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mrs. Oswald, did you ever have a discussion with your\r\nhusband about when he decided that he would like to become a citizen of\r\nthe Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We discussed this and he said that the Soviet Government\r\nwanted him to become a Soviet citizen and furnished him the necessary\r\npapers, but he apparently refused. But the way it appears in his diary,\r\nof course, is quite different--in fact, the exact opposite.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By the exact opposite, you mean that it shows in his diary\r\nthat he was the one that wanted to be a Soviet citizen, and the Soviet\r\nUnion refused to allow that; is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did this conversation on this subject take\r\nplace, Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. About 3 months after we were married.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While you were living in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you remember how the discussion came up?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When Lee wrote the American Embassy requesting return to\r\nthe United States and requesting an American passport, he told me that\r\nit was very lucky that he hadn't become a Soviet citizen, and that his\r\npassport was still in the American Embassy. And that if he had become a\r\nSoviet citizen, it would have been difficult if not impossible to leave.\r\n\r\nBefore I found out about his diary, I didn't realize that the Soviet\r\nGovernment had refused to grant him citizenship, because he never\r\ntalked about this, never mentioned it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, that is the end of the questioning that\r\nI planned to examine Mrs. Oswald about. I understand that Congressman\r\nFord has some.\r\n\r\nI would like before closing to make an offer of what has been marked\r\nnow as Commission Exhibit No. 993, which is the story that Mrs. Oswald\r\ndeveloped in Russian that was furnished to us, and I want to inform the\r\nCommission that it was furnished to us for the purpose of trying to\r\nexamine Mrs. Oswald the first time, and that counsel at that time and\r\npresent counsel wanted to make it very clear that they didn't want to\r\nlose any property interest in that document. And all rights that they\r\nmight have to publish it and use it commercially and any other way that\r\nshe might have, and that it was merely furnished to the Commission for\r\nofficial purposes and very strictly limited in that manner. But I would\r\nlike to offer it and the Commission may want to reserve its decision as\r\nto whether it should be made a part of the record and published. But I\r\nthink it should at this time be offered for your consideration in that\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. Does counsel wish to add anything to that?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Yes, Mr. Chairman; I would, if I may, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I appreciate Mr. Rankin's remarks in connection with the\r\noffering of Mrs. Oswald's memoirs, or manuscript of her memoirs, which,\r\nI understand, is Commission Exhibit No. 993. The manuscript prepared\r\nby Mrs. Oswald was heretofore voluntarily presented for the sole and\r\nexclusive purpose of assisting the Commission in its official duties\r\nfor the Commission's use and benefit and to help the Commission in\r\nevaluating Mrs. Oswald's testimony as well as the testimony of others\r\nin arriving at a report setting forth its findings and conclusions to\r\nthe President and the American people.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald and her two minor children have property rights that are\r\nprivate to her and to them in the publishing and use of the memoirs\r\nset forth in her manuscript, which was written solely for her use\r\nin writing a book for commercial purposes. She does object to the\r\ninclusion of the manuscript in the record, or the publishing of same,\r\nand she does not waive or relinquish or in anyway legally or otherwise\r\ngive away her proprietary rights in this regard, to the manuscript.\r\n\r\nShe respectfully requests that the Commission honor her request in\r\nwhat has heretofore been deemed and what she now deems to be her\r\nassistance to the Commission--and I will say this--that she has told\r\nme repeatedly that she has sought to assist the Commission in every\r\npossible and conceivable way. But in light of that, she does respect\r\nthe Commission's indulgence in not publishing this manuscript, and asks\r\nthat this only be used as it was presented for the purpose of assisting\r\nthe Commission in its official duties, in evaluating the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have any suggestions as to how we might use it and\r\nat the same time not permanently deprive the public of an opportunity\r\nto see it?\r\n\r\nBefore you answer that, I want to say this. I am sure no member of the\r\nCommission wants to--has any desire to in anyway interfere with the\r\nproperty rights of Mrs. Oswald. She did cooperate with us in bringing\r\nthis. We feel grateful that she did do it. On the other hand, we do\r\nwant eventually to have this in the record so the public will know\r\nthat they are getting everything that the Commission has. I am just\r\nwondering if perhaps while you are contemplating writing something on\r\nthe subject, and protecting her property rights, if we could seal this\r\nwith a notation that it was not to be opened for public view until that\r\nhas been done. And you could let us know when that day has passed.\r\nWould that protect her rights?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would be the last one in the\r\nworld to suggest anything either to yourself or to the Commission\r\ninsofar as the way this matter should be handled. I do have, or feel,\r\nthat the manuscript was given to the Commission, the Commission has\r\nhad more than adequate opportunity to interrogate Mrs. Oswald. She is\r\nwilling to stay here now as long as the Commission desires, and will do\r\nso voluntarily without the issuance of a subpena or any other way.\r\n\r\nI think through the interrogation that Mr. Rankin has conducted--I\r\nmight remark, most ably--that certainly the matters covered in the\r\nmanuscript have already been covered in direct sworn testimony. And\r\nwith that thought in mind, it was my feeling, and it is my feeling\r\nthat the Commission and its staff, through the help and assistance\r\nof the manuscript and Mrs. Oswald, have had the benefit of all the\r\nmatters previously written down by Mrs. Oswald, and that if there\r\nare any questions that have not been covered that are covered in the\r\nmanuscript, I am sure that counsel for the Commission could adequately\r\ncover those questions. The manuscript was prepared by Mrs. Oswald\r\nin the form of memoirs. And was not prepared for the use of the\r\nCommission. And I think without the Commission's knowledge--it was\r\nprepared beforehand. And she brought it so the Commission could have\r\nthe effect of it and the use of it. Now, if the Commission feels that\r\nit should be finally published as part of the Commission's report, I\r\nwould certainly hope that the Commission would honor her request and\r\nwithhold the publishing of the manuscript until such time as she has\r\nhad the opportunity to conclude any negotiations which she might have\r\nor might possibly have for the publishing of a book.\r\n\r\nI ask this not so much for Mrs. Oswald herself, but more for her two\r\nminor children.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, we will do at least that. We will take the matter\r\nunder consideration and having in mind her rights and our desire not\r\nto interfere with them we will try to work out a solution that will be\r\nsatisfactory to you and to her.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice. And I might\r\nalso add that the Chief Justice and all members of this Commission and\r\nits staff know full well, or at least I feel would know full well that\r\njust as soon as this report is published and distributed to the public,\r\nor distributed to the press, regardless of what property rights she\r\nmay have now or may have then, it will be extremely difficult for Mrs.\r\nOswald to protect those rights--if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I would like to say, also, for the record that there is\r\nnothing sensational or nothing of a secretive nature in the document.\r\nIt is something that, as you say, was written for publication, and we\r\nassume that it will be some day published, probably, and that if it is\r\nnot given to the public, it will not be because there is anything of a\r\nsecret nature in there. It would only be a question of whether it could\r\nbe done consistent with the rights of the witness. And we will bear\r\nthose in mind, you may be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nAnd if I may add one other thing. I have heretofore made a request on\r\nMr. Rankin in connection with a diary which was presented by Robert\r\nOswald at the time of his testimony to the Commission, that Robert\r\nOswald had prepared shortly after November 22, and which not only\r\nhas he furnished the diary to the Commission, but has also narrated\r\nthat diary by reading same on dictaphone tapes, and I have, in turn,\r\nfurnished it to Mr. Jenner, a member of the Commission's staff.\r\n\r\nI have requested the Commission not to print Robert Oswald's diary\r\nfor the same reasons that I have heretofore outlined in connection\r\nwith Mrs. Oswald's manuscript. And I would hope that the Commission\r\ncould consider Robert Oswald's diary in the same light that you\r\nwould consider this manuscript. I am not saying that either have any\r\ncommercial value, but if they do I would hope that they would inure to\r\nthe benefit of Mrs. Oswald's family and the benefit of Robert Oswald's\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. We will consider that, also. But there are some\r\nportions of the diary of Mr. Oswald that are in the record already\r\nas a result of his examination, as there are things involved in this\r\ndocument of Mrs. Oswald's that are in the record by question and answer.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. There is one other thing, and then I will close on this\r\nparticular subject. Mrs. Oswald does not have a copy of the manuscript\r\nof her memoirs. Her former attorney, Mr. Thorne, or her former\r\nso-called business manager, Mr. James Martin, reportedly to me has\r\nsuch a copy. But at the present time she does not have a copy of this\r\nmanuscript nor do I have a copy of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may have one immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Fine, sir--I would like to say at the Commission's\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; of course, we will see you have one.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. At the time that Robert Oswald gave his testimony to\r\nthe Commission, Mr. Jenner and Mr. Liebler followed the practice of\r\ntaking originals and photostating them or Xerox copying them and giving\r\nthe originals back. Before we do close today, I would like to make a\r\nrequest on the record to have all the articles that Marina has brought\r\nup here in the way of letters and things of that sort returned to her,\r\nwith, of course, adequate copies for the Commission and its use. And I\r\ndon't know whether you have any or not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have made your request.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will consider that along with the other things. Mr.\r\nRankin, will you continue now?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Coulter, could you state for the record whether you\r\nhave related this colloquy to Mrs. Oswald, so that she is informed of\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. COULTER. I gave it to her in general terms, that they were\r\ndiscussing the question of the rights to her manuscript and the rights\r\nto the originals of the various objects in her possession, which she\r\nhad made available to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I have one other offer to make, and\r\nI would like to offer it under Exhibit No. 994, and that would be a\r\ntranslation of this document, that would present the same problems.\r\n\r\nWe have a translation that was made by Mr. Gopadze, the Secret Service\r\nagent, who is quite familiar with the Russian language. But we earlier\r\ntoday had a letter that Mrs. Oswald wrote to the Civil Liberties Union\r\nof Dallas, and she questioned some of the translation from Russian into\r\nEnglish, which was not done by any of our people, of course. And we are\r\nnot so sure about Mr. Gopadze's translation. So we would like to follow\r\nwhat was suggested at that time, that Mr. Coulter make a translation\r\nof this, which we would submit to counsel for Mrs. Oswald, and Mrs.\r\nOswald, for them to be satisfied it is a correct translation, and then\r\nmake that translation a part of the record, subject to your deciding\r\nlater whether it should be.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, instead of referring it to Mr. Coulter, we will\r\nrefer it to Mrs. Oswald's attorney, and he can have prepared any\r\ntranslation that he wishes, and then we will have it for comparison\r\nwith the other.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thought we would save them the expense.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I would rather deal directly with the counsel, and then\r\nwe are not in any cross purposes. He can have it done any way he wants.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Chief Justice, with your kind indulgence, sir, and\r\nthe Commission's kind indulgence, Mr. Coulter's translation of this\r\ndocument would be more than satisfactory with Mrs. Oswald and with\r\nmyself. And, quite frankly, the funds which she has available to her\r\nfor such a purpose are so extremely limited that it would be an extreme\r\nhardship on her to employ an interpreter to translate it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is perfectly all right, that Mr. Coulter should do\r\nit. I have no objection at all to Mr. Coulter. Only when we are dealing\r\nwith a client of a lawyer, we like to deal directly with him, and he\r\ncan deal with the translator if he wishes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I think we are both trying to serve the same purpose.\r\nBut Mr. Rankin and I, I think, are in full agreement on Mr. Coulter's\r\ninterpretation of this manuscript--if that is satisfactory with the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; if it is satisfactory with you, it is satisfactory\r\nwith me. There is no question about that.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Maybe in this manuscript many details are lacking which\r\nhave been developed in my testimony, because I wrote it mainly for\r\npublic consumption.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We understand, Mrs. Oswald. I am sure the Commissioners\r\nall understand that the manuscript is something that was referred to\r\nin order to inquire from you during your giving of testimony, and that\r\nyour testimony, together with the manuscript, should be considered if\r\nthere is any question, because you do not purport to cover everything\r\nin the manuscript. Is that what you are saying?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I am very ashamed that there is so much unnecessary\r\ninformation in this manuscript and that it caused the interpreter so\r\nmuch difficulty in translating it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I then offer under Exhibit No. 994, and\r\nI make, without repeating them, the same suggestions I did about the\r\nRussian document, Exhibit No. 993, and ask that we follow the procedure\r\nof getting the translation, and then make it a part of this record,\r\nsubject to the Commission's determining that it should be.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be done in that manner.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, do you have some matters?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I would like to know if the Commission wants me to make\r\nsome comment on any differences in substance between the manuscript\r\nand the testimony which I have given, or between the manuscript or the\r\ntranslation, whichever translation may be accepted, or both.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will ask the questions, if there is\r\nanything of that nature. Now, Congressman Ford, do you have some\r\nquestions?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I have a few questions. In\r\nthe Soviet Union, when a marriage application is applied for, what are\r\nthe steps that you take?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. There are certain applications which have to be filled out\r\nby the boy and girl.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have to go down together to make the\r\napplication?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It is necessary for both to appear with their passports\r\nand fill out this application.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, Lee Harvey Oswald had to take\r\nhis passport down to--at the time that he applied for a marriage\r\napplication?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Lee Oswald did not have his passport at the time since it\r\nwas in the American Embassy. He went with his residence permission to\r\nthe office. But our marriage was entered into his American passport\r\nafter we were married and before we left the Soviet Union for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So it is not the passport in the sense that we\r\nthink of a passport, that we get to travel to a foreign country?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Since most marriages are concluded between Soviet\r\ncitizens, they only present their internal passports to the marriage\r\nlicense bureau. But if there is a marriage between a Soviet citizen\r\nand a foreigner, he presents his residence permission and his foreign\r\npassport, also, if he has one. If he doesn't have it, the residence\r\npermission is enough.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do we have the document that he presented at the\r\ntime he applied for marriage?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know. I think he had to turn that in before he\r\nleft the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Are you referring to his American passport?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No; I am referring to the document that he\r\npresented at the time he applied for marriage.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Which would be a Russian instrument?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know if it is available. I think he had to turn it\r\nin before he left the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, both you and Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nsigned the necessary documents for marriage?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. During your period in Minsk, following your\r\nmarriage, did you and Lee Harvey Oswald have any marital difficulties,\r\nany problems between the two of you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We had some difficulties in connection with the fact that\r\nI told my uncle and aunt that we were going to leave for the United\r\nStates. Lee did not want me to tell anybody that we were preparing to\r\nleave for the United States.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That was the only difficulty you had?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was your vacation trip to Kharkov--was that a\r\nvacation, or did that result from any marital difficulty?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. My aunt invited me to Kharkov, and that is why I went. It\r\nwas not the result of any marital difficulties.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You testified a few minutes ago, Mrs. Oswald, that\r\nthere was a difference in the historic diary and what Lee Oswald told\r\nyou concerning the status of his application for Soviet citizenship.\r\nYou have read the historic diary?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I have only read what the FBI agents translated, those\r\nparts of the diary which were translated into Russian by the FBI.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that much of it or a small part of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was the part about his attempt at suicide.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And also the part concerning the status of his\r\nSoviet citizenship?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think that that is the part which deals with his\r\napplication for Soviet citizenship. I don't know of any other parts of\r\nthe diary in which this would be set forth.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You have no idea of when he wrote the historic\r\ndiary?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know when he began, but I know that after we were\r\nmarried he spent the evenings writing his diary. I think that is the\r\nreason why he didn't want me to study English while we were still in\r\nRussia, because he didn't want me to be able to read his diary.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He never read you the diary in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the trip back to the United States, Lee Oswald\r\nwrote on the Holland-American Line paper some additional comments. Did\r\nyou see him write this on the trip?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I saw him writing this when we were in the cabin on the\r\nship. I thought they were just letters, though, and I didn't read them.\r\nHe didn't write these when I was around.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He didn't write them while you were present?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I might mention for the record that this document has\r\nalready been introduced as Commission Exhibit No. 25.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If you didn't see him write it in the cabin how\r\ndid you know he wrote it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In the first place, because the paper was from the\r\nHolland-American Line, and then I think--in the second place, because I\r\nsaw these pages covered with writing in the cabin, and I think that he\r\nmust have gone some place else on the ship, such as the library, to do\r\nthe actual writing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you read that which he wrote on the ship?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I have not read them, because I don't understand\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He never read it to you in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At any time on the trip back, from the time you\r\nstarted to leave the Soviet Union until you arrived in the United\r\nStates, did you have any trouble at the border of the Soviet Union or\r\nany other country?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We had no difficulty with the authorities of any kind\r\non any border. I think that my husband may have had some financial\r\ndifficulties in New York, when he arrived.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You left the Soviet Union by what means, now?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Train and boat.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You went from the Soviet Union to Poland by train?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We took a train from Moscow to Amsterdam, through Poland\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You had no difficulty going into Poland, going\r\nthrough Germany?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Or into Holland?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. And there were no difficulties in our entering the\r\nUnited States, either.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you were living at Elsbeth Street, did you\r\nand Lee have any domestic trouble?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you relate how frequently and how serious\r\nthey were?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The first difficulty we had was at Elsbeth Street when I\r\ntold the landlady that I was from Russia. My husband had told her that\r\nI was from Czechoslovakia, and he became very angry with me for telling\r\nher I was from Russia, and said that I talked too much.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That was the first incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were there others?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Then we had difficulties because I had a number of Russian\r\nfriends in Elsbeth Street, around there, in Dallas, and he was jealous\r\nof me, and didn't want me to see them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. During this time, did he physically abuse you? Did\r\nhe hit you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Mr. De Mohrenschildt reprimand Lee for his\r\nabuse to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know. He didn't support this. He didn't favor this\r\nconduct of my husband's. But I don't think he ever said anything to him\r\nabout it, or told him that he shouldn't do it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. De Mohrenschildt didn't say anything to Lee\r\nOswald in your presence about his abuse towards you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; not in my presence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Mr. De Mohrenschildt take you to Mellers, was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Anna Meller--no; he did not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. De Mohrenschildt did not take you there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; we had a quarrel, and I took the child and took a\r\ntaxi, and went by myself there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have money to pay for a taxi?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Anna Meller paid for the taxi.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you got to Anna Meller's?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I believe that is all, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles, do you have any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A couple, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nYou have described this morning briefly the manner of your life in\r\nMinsk. I wonder if you would also now discuss that in the United\r\nStates. What did you do with your leisure time, how did Oswald handle\r\nhis leisure time when he wasn't working?\r\n\r\nI am speaking of your stays in Dallas, Fort Worth, and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. My life in the United States was not quite as carefree\r\nas it had been in the Soviet Union. I was occupied all the time with\r\nhousework, and I couldn't go anywhere. Lee spent a good deal of time\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were you together most of the time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that you knew where Lee was. Lee wasn't away on trips\r\nmuch of the time, except for his trip to Mexico, and when he was absent\r\nin New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That is correct. We were together.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know what he was reading in those days?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He read nonfiction almost entirely and mainly historical\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was he reading Russian books or mostly English books?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He could read Russian, but he read only English works.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was he doing much writing in this period, during the\r\nAmerican stay?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When we were living on Elsbeth Street, he wrote something,\r\nand also on Neely Street, I think it was in connection with the Walker,\r\nGeneral Walker incident.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know what happened to that particular writing?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I know that he destroyed this after the Walker business.\r\n\r\nHe had a map of Dallas, and he used to go off by himself and think\r\nabout the map, and work on it. I think you have this map in among the\r\nmaterials of the Commission. He used to work on it, and the least\r\ndisturbance used to upset him very much when he was working on this map.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When you say he used to go away, do you mean go away in the\r\nhouse or outside the house with the map?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In the house, in the kitchen, and would tell me not to\r\ncome in, not to make any noise at all.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you specify as to time and date, as to about when he\r\nacquired this map and began this study of the map?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Could I ask the Commission just when we were living on\r\nElsbeth Street, since I have forgotten?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. November 1962 to March 1963. November 3, 1962 to March 2,\r\n1963.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think it was at the end of January, it was after New\r\nYears. I think he had a map all the time, but he started becoming\r\nparticularly occupied with it at the end of January 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did Oswald, to your knowledge, have friends, associates,\r\nother men whom he saw, in addition to the considerable number whom\r\nyou have described as your friends in Dallas and Fort Worth, whom you\r\nhave already described? Did he have any business friends or any other\r\nfriends you can think of that used to come to the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No one, except for my friends whom I have already told you\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman, did you have any more?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was speaking of the United States.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; he told me that he was working on this map in\r\nconnection with the bus schedules. He had a kind of bus schedule,\r\nand--a paper with bus schedules on it, and he was somehow comparing\r\nthem or working on them, or doing something with these two documents.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you left the Soviet Union, Lee borrowed money\r\nfrom the U.S. Government to pay for your transportation back to the\r\nUnited States. Did you have any other money of your own at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. We had--it is permissible to exchange a certain amount of\r\nSoviet rubles into American dollars in such cases, and we did exchange\r\nsome Soviet rubles--I think about $180 worth--when we left. But that\r\nwasn't enough to pay the whole trip.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Lee had borrowed from the Government approximately\r\n$600?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. $450, and then the exchange made a total of $600 and\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This $180 was used with the State Department money\r\nfor the transportation and the funds for the trip?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know, since my husband took care of that whole\r\nmatter. He never talked about money with me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you describe one of the border crossings?\r\nWhat did the Government officials do when you went from Poland into\r\nGermany, for example? Tell us what actually happened.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The train stopped and people come in and check your\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nOn the Russian border, of course, people come in and look at your\r\nbags--that is to say, they don't rifle through everything, but they\r\npick things at random and look at them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Lee carry all the documents?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He carried all the documents, since I had the baby to look\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the Polish-German border, did they actually\r\nexamine the documents?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. More carefully between Russia and Poland than between\r\nPoland and Germany.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Lee make any acquaintances on the train and\r\nthe boat?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. On the boat there were two Rumanian girls we talked with,\r\nsince I had studied a little bit of Moldavian before, which is similar\r\nto Russian, and could speak a little. And on that basis we met and\r\ntalked a little.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did George De Mohrenschildt at any time take you\r\nany place from the Elsbeth Street residence?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only to his house.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Lee accompany you at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; once he took us both home to see his daughter. He\r\ntook us--took me to see his daughter, at a time when I was living in\r\nFort Worth, and Lee was living in Dallas. I might be confused about\r\njust who went, and when.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But he only took you once from one place to his\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; we went several times to his house. Maybe two or three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Lee accompany you on any of these occasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Mr. De Mohrenschildt took us once to the Ford's house. It\r\nwas on New Year's, I think, Katya Ford's house. It was either Christmas\r\nor New Year's. I don't think that Mr. De Mohrenschildt is as dangerous\r\nas he sounds. This is my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I wasn't implying that he was dangerous. I was\r\njust trying to----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He talks all the time. Did he appear before the Commission\r\nor not?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We have his testimony.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I have nothing further.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that is all, Mrs. Oswald. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. I have some questions, if I may.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; Mr. McKenzie.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. You mentioned earlier, in response to some question, that\r\nyour husband had stated that the Soviet Government wanted him to become\r\na Soviet citizen, but that his diary says the opposite.\r\n\r\nWhen did you first learn that the Soviet Government wanted Lee Harvey\r\nOswald to become a Soviet citizen?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I heard this 3 months after we were married, from Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did any Soviet----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who did you hear it from?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. From Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did any Soviet Government official come to see you or Lee\r\nafter you were married, and visit with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did Lee, from time to time, have to report to any Soviet\r\nGovernment agency after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And how often did he make a report to a government\r\nofficial or to a government agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He had to go every month or every 3 months. I don't\r\nremember how often. It was either every month or every 2 or 3 and get a\r\nstamp in his residence permit.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And how long would he be gone on those occasions from\r\nhome, or from work?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. About half an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. You have mentioned that he had Cuban friends and friends\r\nfrom the Argentine in Minsk. Did he ever have any Mexican friends in\r\nMinsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did he ever mention to you anyone that he knew in Mexico,\r\neither from Cuba or from the Soviet Union or from any other place, any\r\nname of anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He might have had some, but I don't know anything about\r\nany of them. He never mentioned it.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. It has been reported that--in the papers--that at the\r\ntime you left New Orleans, or at the time that Lee Harvey Oswald left\r\nNew Orleans, that he had two books on Marxism and a fiction book\r\nwritten by Ian Fleming called \"To Russia With Love.\" Do you recall\r\nseeing that book there in the apartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I only knew about the two books on Marxism and Leninism. I\r\ndon't know anything about this third one.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And those books you know about, were they books from the\r\npublic library in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think these were his own private possession. I think he\r\nhad even a book in English when he was in Russia on Marxism.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. After your arrival in the United States, and after you\r\nhad left Fort Worth, and had moved into your own apartment, did your\r\nhusband have any money?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When he left Dallas for Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think he had some money saved up. He always was saving\r\nmoney for a rainy day.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. From what source did he save that money? Where did the\r\nmoney come from?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Only from his salary, from his wages.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. When he was not working, did he have any other source of\r\nmoney, or did he have money?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When he wasn't working, he got some unemployment\r\ncompensation from the place where he had been working.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did he ever receive money to your knowledge from any\r\nother sources, other than from the Government or from his work?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The only sources I know of were the companies where he\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Who did your husband consider as good friends of his in\r\nDallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He was most friendly with George De Mohrenschildt.\r\nHowever, this is not a very nice thing to say for Mr. De\r\nMohrenschildt's reputation. This has been--had a harmful effect on Mr.\r\nDe Mohrenschildt's reputation as a result of the assassination, the\r\nfact that he was friendly with my husband.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did your husband have any other good friends? For\r\nexample, did he consider Michael Paine a good friend of his?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; he didn't like Michael Paine. Therefore, I was\r\nsurprised when they went to this meeting together. Perhaps they became\r\nfriends after this. But it didn't seem so to me. He didn't show it to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Did your husband ever give you money or did you ever\r\nhandle money in caring for the household, or did he take care of the\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He never gave me any money. We would go shopping together,\r\nand he would make all the payments.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Were there not times when you didn't have enough money\r\nand food in the house, and friends had to help you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It never happened that there was no food in the house and\r\nthat friends had to help us. The only time when this might have been\r\nthe case was immediately after our arrival in the United States, when\r\nI gave some Russian lessons to Mr. Gregory and his son, and he paid\r\nme for it. And once after we arrived Mr. George Bouhe saw that I was\r\nrather thin and took us to a grocery store and bought us a lot of stuff.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And did Mr. George Bouhe or Mrs. Ford have to take you to\r\nthe hospital at one time or another?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. For June?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Not Mrs. Ford and not Mr. Bouhe.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Who was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Lydia Dymitruk took me to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mrs. Oswald, I think that will be all.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Chief Justice, before we close for the day I do have\r\none request I would like to make of the Commission on the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. On behalf of Mrs. Oswald, I would like to have returned\r\nto her the original or original copies of all letters which she has\r\npreviously furnished to the Commission, diaries, pictures, or any\r\npersonal property of Lee Harvey Oswald that was presented to the\r\nCommission, including his personal effects and his diary, in particular\r\nhis wedding ring, a watch, belt buckles, or any personal effects\r\nbelonging to either Lee Harvey Oswald or Mrs. Oswald that have been\r\npresented as original exhibits to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will consider that in connection with all\r\nthe other things that you asked for in connection with her writings.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. And may I respectfully ask this. In the Commission's\r\nconsideration of our request, in connection with the original\r\ninstruments or documents, or whatever it may be, do you at this time\r\nhave any idea how long it would be before the Commission would decide?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I think----\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mind you, I ask that as respectfully as I possibly can.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I answer you as well as I can. We are driving to\r\nconclude the work of the Commission, and we believe that it will be\r\ncompleted in the next month--we hope so, anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Of course she has no objection whatsoever for the\r\nCommission to have the documents which it now has as long as the\r\noriginals are returned to her.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will give consideration to that, because there are\r\nsome things that are evidence here, that belonged to him, that perhaps\r\nwill have to remain evidence. I can't make any analysis of all of those\r\nthings at the present time. But, for instance, let us say, the gun.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. We want that, too.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I say, we will give consideration to that. But I cannot\r\ngive you any assurance of it at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to have the record show at\r\nthis point--we have no objection to what you propose and say we should\r\ndo about supplying new copies of material, but I don't want the record\r\nto indicate we took their copies away from them, because we understand\r\ntheir manager and former counsel kept the copies or the originals, and\r\nhave them. So that we are not just taking them for ourselves. I don't\r\nwant the record to appear----\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Mr. Rankin, I would not have the record reflect that,\r\neither. And I say that at all times that they were voluntarily given\r\nto the Commission. And the only thing I am asking for is a return of\r\neverything Mrs. Oswald has previously furnished the Commission, with\r\nthe understanding that the Commission has the copies of them--she wants\r\nthe originals back. In particular, there is a wedding ring that I would\r\nlike to ask the Commission to return at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, these things will have to be considered, all\r\nof them, by the whole Commission, Counsel. But we will give them\r\nconsideration. We won't be turning anything back today, because we want\r\nthe whole Commission to see what is essential.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENZIE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right. I think that will be all. The Commission will\r\nadjourn.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 3:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, June 16, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT ALAN SURREY\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 10:15 a.m., on June 16, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, and Representative Hale Boggs, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; and Albert E. Jenner,\r\nJr., assistant counsel.\r\n\r\n(Members present: Chief Justice Warren, Senator Cooper, and\r\nRepresentative Boggs.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Surrey, we have asked you to come here to testify\r\nconcerning two things. The first is we want to ask you concerning the\r\nprinting of a publication entitled, \"Wanted for Treason\" that appeared\r\non the streets November 22, 1963, in Dallas. And then we propose to ask\r\nyou also some questions about the home of General Walker, in connection\r\nwith an attempt that was made on his life some time before the 22d of\r\nNovember. You are prepared to testify, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I talked to Mr. Jenner. I am prepared to testify as\r\nconcerns the Walker episode. I do not wish to testify as concerns the\r\nwanted poster, or the \"Wanted for Treason.\"\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. For what reason--what reason do you assign for not\r\nwanting to? It is not a question of whether a witness wants to testify\r\nhere. He is subpenaed to testify, and he must testify unless he has a\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe that my answers would tend to incriminate me\r\nunder the fifth amendment.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. You are entitled to raise that question.\r\nAnd, if you do, that privilege will be respected. But we will ask you\r\na question concerning it, and if you claim your privilege it will be\r\nrespected. And then if you want to testify--are willing to testify\r\nabout the other matters, you may do so.\r\n\r\nWould you rise and raise your right hand and be sworn? You solemnly\r\nswear that the testimony you are about to give before this Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I do.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, I would suppose that we would not\r\nbe limited to one question. If he wants to plead the fifth amendment,\r\nof course that is his privilege. But I would hope that we could ask\r\nhim several questions, and if he wants to plead he can plead on each\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, on any phase of it that you wish to ask him a\r\nquestion, of course it is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenner will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Is it my understanding that if I do invoke the fifth\r\namendment to begin with, then I do not have the privilege of later on\r\ninvoking it, is that correct?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I believe it is a fact that on any phase of your\r\ntestimony, if you testify in part about that phase, you can be required\r\nto testify fully concerning it. But if there is one phase of your\r\ntestimony that you want to claim the privilege on, and are willing\r\nto testify as to other matters not connected with it, you can do so\r\nwithout waiving your privilege. Does that answer your question?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. Mr. Jenner?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 995\r\nthe original of the subpena served upon Mr. Surrey.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. A subpena was served on you, was it, Mr. Surrey?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well, it may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 995 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are appearing in response to the subpena?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you furnished with copies of the Senate joint\r\nresolution, or legislation which created--authorized the creation of\r\nthe Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. At a previous time; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And President Johnson's Executive order, and the rules and\r\nregulations of the Commission as to taking of testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I was. It was hard to read them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; they are a little bit difficult to read.\r\n\r\nIn order that you may exercise the rights that you have indicated to\r\nthe Chief Justice, I will question you first about the pamphlet, after\r\nasking you the preliminary questions as to your name.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Robert Alan Surrey.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is your address?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 3506 Lindenwood, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long have you resided there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Eight years.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is your age?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where were you born?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Oak Park, Ill.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you move to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. First moved there in 1948, and then left for 2 years, from\r\n1951 to 1953, and then moved back to Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are a college graduate; are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What university or college?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Northwestern.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In Evanston, Ill?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you receive your degree?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are married?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is Mrs. Surrey a native born American?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; she is a Dallasite.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She is a Dallas girl?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is your business, occupation, or profession?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I am a printing salesman.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For what company?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. For Johnson Printing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that located at 2700 North Haskell, in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long have you been employed by Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Seven years.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us in a general way what Johnson Printing\r\nCo. does? I appreciate the name in the title of the company indicates\r\nprinting, but what kind?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Commercial printing, advertising printing, house\r\norgans--just general commercial work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have some military service?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you state what it was?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I was 4 years in the Navy, in World War II.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you also the president of a book publishing company\r\nlocated in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The American Eagle Publishing Co?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The only volume I have seen--there was a publication of\r\nreprints of newspaper stories.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Called the Assassination Story, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your name appeared, I think, in that as the president\r\nof the company.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A cover letter that was on the back cover.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This was not our only publication. We have done many\r\npublications before that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do we have a copy of this publication?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of this particular one?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Mr. Alger's office came to me and requested two copies for\r\nthe Warren Commission, which I furnished to him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Whose office?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Congressman Bruce Alger's office.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did we make such a request through Congressman\r\nAlger?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am not advised as to whether we did or not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I am quite sure we did not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did we receive any such copies?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is none among our exhibits in the exhibit room.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. His secretary called, and they came out to the house and\r\ngot two copies of it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How long ago was this?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Oh, I would say 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. When did you publish this book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe it was finally ready on January 1, right after\r\nJanuary 1--January 1, 2, or 3, right in that area.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What does the book allege?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. We took the 10-day period following the assassination from\r\nboth Dallas papers, the Dallas Morning News, and Dallas Times Herald,\r\nand just all the clippings pertaining to it were in chronological\r\norder, and just shot them cold, and published them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Nothing else--just newspaper clippings?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Just newspaper clippings.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. No editorial comment of any kind?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Outside of the letter on the back; no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And what is the letter on the back?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It said--this is just to the best of my knowledge, I\r\ndon't recall exactly--\"This is the local report of what happened when\r\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated. It is difficult to muzzle a local\r\nreporter in his own local paper. And we feel that some of the news that\r\nmight not get out would be included in this book. We do not guarantee\r\nthe accuracy of the information, but it will pose some questions, a\r\nfew perhaps that the Warren Commission will not see fit to answer,\" I\r\nbelieve was in there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Not see fit to what?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To answer.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What was the implication of that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The implication being, as I see it, in Dallas--a local\r\nreporter--this is, for example. A local reporter from the Times\r\nHerald went down to the Western Union office several days after the\r\nassassination, and was told by the people in the Western Union office\r\nthat, yes, they remembered Oswald, he had been in, he had gotten money\r\norders, either the day before or just recently he had sent a wire to\r\nsomebody, and they recalled his Swahili handwriting, and so forth.\r\nWell, I feel that surely Western Union knows who sent Oswald money, and\r\nso forth. Now, I don't know if this will come out of this Commission or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. The implication was that this Commission would\r\nnot investigate these allegations?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No--perhaps.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, what did you mean by the word \"muzzle\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Of the press?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You used \"muzzle\" in this letter--written. I\r\ndon't have the letter before me. I would like to have it.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't, either. I would like to know what the exact\r\nwording was on it, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you write it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And the implication was that this Commission\r\nwould not seek out the entire truth of the incidences arising----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Oh, no, sir; this was not the implication of the muzzling.\r\nThis was not the implication.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What was the implication of the statement you\r\nmade a moment ago, about questions that would not be asked by this\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. News happens in an area, and after it has been up to the\r\nnational news system, and then comes back through, and analyzed and so\r\nforth, I don't put full credit any longer.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Your theory is that in a matter as significant as\r\nthe assassination of the President of the United States, that the news\r\nas reported outside of Dallas would be untruthful?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Possibly.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Is that the substance of the book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No. No; the substance of the book is strictly newspaper\r\nclippings.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Plus a letter.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The letter is on the back cover of the book, just a cover\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Tell me more about what the letter says.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would much rather have the letter. I don't recall exactly\r\nwhat it does say, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you write it yourself, or did somebody write it for\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I wrote it myself.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You don't remember what you wrote?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; not as per specific words, I do not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, not specific words. The sense.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. You picked the specific word \"muzzling\" out of it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You used that word; I didn't use it. \"Muzzle\"\r\nwhen you refer to a bipartisan Commission, established by the President\r\nof the United States, with a mandate to obtain the truth, is a rather\r\nserious word. I didn't use it--you used it.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Based on some past experience that I have had--I was in\r\nOxford, Miss., with General Walker. Based on past experience of the\r\nnewspaper reports I heard coming out of national news media on that\r\nincident, which I saw with my own eyes, I could not believe any longer\r\nthings which I read in the newspaper.\r\n\r\nNow, the local paper there--and I was not privileged to read the local\r\npapers at the time--may have had some of the truth that went on there.\r\nBut there certainly wasn't a good deal of it coming out in the national\r\nnews media.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you select the clippings that were in the book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Pardon?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you select the newspaper clippings?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who selected them?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A couple named Osburn that lived in Dallas.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who are they?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Just some people that live in Dallas.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know their names?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Just Osburn.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know their address?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How did you happen to be associated with them?\r\n\r\nMr SURREY. Mrs. Osburn works at Walker's offce.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You are speaking of General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, now, go ahead. I would request, Mr.\r\nChairman, that this book and this letter be made a part of the record\r\nof this Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you supply us with a copy of the book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. If I have one, sir. They are out of print. And I don't\r\nknow----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are they all sold?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, we were going into reprint, right at that particular\r\ntime the attorney from the Times Herald called and put a cease and\r\ndesist on them.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How many copies did you have printed?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 3,000.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Were they sold?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Some of them were; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How many were sold?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say about 900 to a thousand.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What became of the rest of them?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. They were sent to our presubscriber list, and given away.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is this company that published them a corporation?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; it is a partnership.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who are the partners?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Myself and General Walker.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And General Walker?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was this pamphlet that you printed included in\r\nthe book?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. That is----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. \"Wanted for Treason\"?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Commission Exhibit No. 996.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That was not included?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You didn't make that a part of the record of the\r\nevents surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I did not make it a part of the record?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. In this record that you published.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I had nothing to do with making it a part of the record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You published the book, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; but these were newspaper reprints.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You published this, too, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You didn't publish it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You are speaking of the book now?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I am talking about your printing company.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. You are talking about my printing company?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. The company you work for.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, Johnson Printing Co.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Didn't you publish this?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Who printed it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, I, of course, fully appreciate\r\nthe right of the witness to plead the fifth amendment. But I would\r\nsimply like to make the observation that this is the only witness out\r\nof hundreds who has pled the fifth amendment, and that obviously if\r\neach witness had done this, then the charge of being muzzled would be\r\nsomething that we would really be confronted with. I would simply like\r\nto make that observation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may proceed, Mr. Jenner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you. Does the American Eagle Publishing Co. have a\r\nbookstore subsidiary or outlet?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; we do not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is the American Eagle Book Store?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. There is no American Eagle Book Store.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have a headquarters?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have a telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are you listed with the local authorities under a\r\nfictitious or assumed name?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes--doing business as?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Doing business as, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And the names given are yourself and General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where is that filed--with your county clerk?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. County clerk in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We have talked about General Walker. That is General Edwin\r\nA. Walker, now resigned?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And do you know a Robert G. Krause?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I refuse to answer on the grounds the answer may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he not formerly employed by Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I refuse to answer for the same reason.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Excuse me. Mr. Chief Justice--we will have\r\ntestimony from Mr. Krause, I presume?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; do you know of a company, a printing company,\r\nLettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I refuse to answer--same reason.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. For the reason it would tend to incriminate you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you not prepare the copy for Commission Exhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the same reason; that it would tend\r\nto incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And, in turn, turn that copy over to Robert G. Krause, of\r\nthe Lettercraft Printing Co. for reproduction?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer, same reason.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 996 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Exhibiting again Exhibit No.--Commission Exhibit No. 996 to\r\nyou, you will notice a front and profile view of President Kennedy. Did\r\nyou bring to Robert Krause photographs of which this is a reproduction?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In fact, did you not bring to Robert G. Krause two slick\r\npaper magazine photographs of President Kennedy and request and engage\r\nhim to make photographs of the slick paper magazine photos for the\r\npurpose of reproduction?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer; same reason.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you not pay Robert G. Krause and his wife for\r\nprinting some 5,000 to 10,000 of these handbills, of which Commission\r\nExhibit No. 996 is a copy?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you thereafter--did you not in fact thereafter,\r\nyourself--well, I will ask you first--yourself, distribute duplicates\r\nof Exhibit No. 996 in and about the streets of Dallas, Tex., on\r\nNovember 22 and days preceding?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Point of order. Can I ask a question? If I now answer one\r\nor two in through here, does this----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, this is connected with the entire situation--the\r\npublication, the distribution of it is one and the same subject matter,\r\nI would think.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I might bring this out. Having received\r\nthe rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to the taking\r\nof testimony, you are aware of the fact that you are entitled to have\r\ncounsel present?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you appear without counsel?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I cannot afford to bring counsel.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you do appear without counsel?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the record should\r\nshow if this man requested counsel he would be entitled to counsel,\r\nwould he not?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He certainly would. And he has not requested it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I just want the record to show that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you request counsel?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. From whom, sir?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you request the Commission to appoint counsel for\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I did not. I did not know this was available.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I might say it is still available.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Would this be a court-appointed?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Beg pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Would this be a court-appointed attorney?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No; it would be an attorney appointed by the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Proceed, Mr. Jenner.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You prefer not to have an attorney appointed by\r\nthe Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. We might let the record show at this point, also,\r\nthat the American Bar Association has been closely associated with the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. What does that mean? I mean what is the purpose of that\r\nremark?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. To show that the attorneys appointed are\r\ncompletely objective.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I did not imply they were not, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know Mrs. Clifford Mercer, Dorothy Mercer?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know Mr. Clifford Mercer?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer; same reason.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know of a photoengraving company in Dallas, 2027\r\nYoung Street, Monks Bros.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know J. T. Monk or J. T. Monk, Jr.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer, same grounds.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have one of the workmen, printing workmen, at\r\nJohnson Printing Co., set type for the copy which appears on Commission\r\nExhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And thereafter, after that type was set, have photographs\r\nmade of that type?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer; same reason.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know Mr. Bernard Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No. We are in another field now, I gather.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, I don't want to represent to you that it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you had any business relations with a man by the name\r\nof Bernard Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. If this is in your opinion still part of the\r\nother--concerning these leaflets, then I will plead the fifth amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, with the policy of the Commission to be\r\nfully fair to all witnesses, may I respond to the witness and say to\r\nhim there is that possibility.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. There is that possibility; yes--that is a sufficient\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And being that possibility, do you wish to decline to\r\nanswer the question on the ground an answer may tend to incriminate you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, unless you or other members of the\r\nCommission have some questions on this line of examination, I will not\r\nask further questions with respect to it--unless you gentlemen desire\r\nto ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Any further questions, Congressman Boggs?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was anyone associated with you in the publication\r\nof this leaflet?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did General Walker have anything to do with it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me--but, no.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What? Now you have opened that up, sir--if you say--was\r\nyour answer no, or is your answer that you claim the privilege?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. My answer is that I claim the privilege, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is different.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I just ask one question? To return for a moment\r\nto this book that you printed with newspaper clippings--what was your\r\npurpose in printing it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. As a memento, primarily.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You had no other purpose?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Didn't you really have the purpose of impugning the\r\nwork of this Commission and giving the implication that it would not go\r\nfully and thoroughly into all questions?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir. This was not the intent; no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What was the allegation in the cease and desist\r\norder which was issued against you by the Dallas newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That this would be in competition to a book which they\r\nwere going to promote--I believe the AP. At the time--the Osburns had\r\nthis, and they were gathering it together, and they brought it over\r\none day, and it looked like a real good idea. Other people had stacks\r\nand stacks of papers. And this was a compilation of clippings of the\r\npaper. And everybody thought it was such a good idea that we thought we\r\nwould publish it. So I got it into brownline form, which is a proof, a\r\npreliminary proof--silver prints, you may call them in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. For how much did you sell these books a copy?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. We gave them free to our presubscriber list.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I didn't ask you that.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. They were $5 per copy.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And how many did you say you sold?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. About 900 to a 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What happened to the money?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It was put into the American Eagle Publishing Co. account.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have a regular bookkeeping system?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And those figures would be available, showing how many\r\nyou had sold, would they?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In your books?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Is the American Eagle Publishing Co. an\r\nincorporated company?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What is it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Partnership, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Who are the partners?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Myself and General Walker.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And this presubscription list, how many people on\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say 700, 800.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You publish a newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; we don't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What do you publish besides this book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Pamphlets--pamphlets.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You receive part of your income from the American Eagle\r\nPublishing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You serve as president, but you receive no compensation for\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is true.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us, please, the address of the American\r\nEagle Publishing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. P.O. Box 750, Dallas 21.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It has no physical office itself--just the post office\r\naddress?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct. That mail comes to my desk at Johnson\r\nPrinting Co. That is the same post office box as Johnson Printing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. And where do you keep--where does American\r\nPublishing Co. warehouse or keep or store its pamphlets and books?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 4011 Turtle Creek Boulevard, Mr. Walker's residence. I have\r\na room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is General Walker's residence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is General Walker's residence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who owns the Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is--the stock is split, four or five different people.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. A corporation?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who are they?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Mr. Bryan Snyder is chairman of the board. Mr. Emil Borak\r\nis president, and Mr. Lewis C. Owens is treasurer. I believe some stock\r\nis held by Oliver Snyder, and I have some stock. And Mr. Fallon Snyder.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It is a commercial company?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is General Walker connected with it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; he is not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Or with the other people, as far as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is Mr. Borak the general manager of the plant itself?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; he is president of the company.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Who is the general manager of the plant?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Mr. Owens.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Owens.\r\n\r\nDid you acquaint Mr. Owens or Mr. Borak, either of them, with the fact\r\nthat you had Commission Exhibit No. 996 printed at the Lettercraft\r\nPrinting Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make either or both of them aware of the fact that\r\nsome of the copy or all of the copy with respect to Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 996 was prepared by way of printing at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How many printers do you have at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. How many employees?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No--that operate linotypes or operate these machines that\r\nproduce these slugs--what is the name of that kind of machine?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, it would be a monotype or a linotype or a Ludlow.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are these lines on Exhibit No. 996 Ludlow productions?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who are the Ludlow machine operators at Johnson Printing\r\nCo.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Oh, I would say there are probably 10 or 15 that operate\r\nthe Ludlow machine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does your recollection serve you to name those who operated\r\nthe Ludlow machines any time during the first 22 days of November 1963?\r\nIf so, name them.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you able to name any of the linotype operators who were\r\nemployed during the first 22 days of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Who were employed at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, I gather this has nothing to do with this. So may I\r\nanswer?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I don't want to lead you to believe it doesn't, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the ground it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From whom was the paper purchased on which appears the\r\nimprinting on the exhibit identified here as Commission Exhibit No. 996.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the same grounds.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see another reproduction of Commission Exhibit No.\r\n996 at any time from the 1st of November 1963 to and including the 22d\r\nof November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I decline to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I will now depart from this particular\r\nphase, if that is permissible.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am now going to turn, Mr. Surrey, to the attempt on the\r\nlife of General Walker.\r\n\r\nFirst I would like to have you examine a series of photographs which\r\npurport to be photographs of the area of the Walker house.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, may I approach the witness for this purpose?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show the witness Commission Exhibit No. 2, Item No. 7,\r\nand subdivision item No. P-2. Do you see that, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Examining the subitem, P-2, is the area depicted in that\r\nphotograph familiar to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is. It is the alley in behind Mr. Walker's\r\nresidence, looking west.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Looking west?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you be able to help us as to an estimate, perhaps\r\nfrom the nature of the foliage, and your familiarity with the Walker\r\npremises, as to when that photograph might have been taken, as to\r\nseason of the year?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say late fall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could it have been the early spring, mid-March, for\r\nexample? 1st of March, along in there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It could have been; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Either in the fall, when there is a deleafing or lack of\r\nfoliage on trees, or the early spring?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you what purports to be the same thing, also\r\nmarked--it is a larger photograph--Commission Exhibit No. 2, Item\r\nNo. 7. Directing your attention to the subdivision P-2 you have just\r\ntestified about, are they photographs----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Basically the same thing. It looks like this one was taken\r\na little closer to the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say this one, you mean the larger of the two?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On Commission Exhibit No. 3, Item 14, subitem P-1,\r\ndirecting your attention to that, you recognize that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is a picture of the back of the residence of 4011\r\nTurtle Creek.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. General Edwin Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I perhaps should have asked you this: You are familiar with\r\nthe area surrounding General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have been there a good many times, have you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On all sides of the home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And are you familiar with the inside of the home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And have you worked there from time to time over the years?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long have you been associated with General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Since the beginning of his campaign, when that was--I think\r\nthe spring--about 3 years now.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What campaign is that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. When he ran for Governor of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That initiated your association with him?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what are your duties in your association with General\r\nWalker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I am just a volunteer helper, whatever he needed, volunteer\r\nhelp in doing, I would help.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you compensated?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I am not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have never received any compensation?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have never received any compensation from the\r\npublishing company we have identified that published that book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you handle any funds for General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Of General Walker's fund?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Or any funds----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Except what----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Or any funds that come to General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; only that comes to American Eagle Co., which is in\r\nfact, I guess, technically his funds.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, what funds do come to American Eagle Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Funds for purchasing of materials, and some donations. That\r\nis it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Outside of donations, how do you get your funds for\r\npublishing?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. From the sale of materials.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And the rest of it is all donations?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Donations are extremely small, as a matter of fact, yes. We\r\noperate on the sale of materials.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How much in the aggregate of donations have you had?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To American Eagle Publishing Co.?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. A hundred dollars?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Over 2 years or 2-1/2 years.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where did you get the money to publish your book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. At the beginning of American Eagle Publishing Co., we\r\nstarted with a backlog of books which had been used in the campaign.\r\nThis was Mr. Walker's contribution to the American Eagle Publishing Co.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did General Walker sell his campaign books?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't know if he did or not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, you don't pay publishing funds with books, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. From the sale of the books which were turned over to\r\nAmerican Eagle Co. at its inception, from the sale of those books, we\r\nhave accumulated funds to go on with others.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. At its inception, where did you get the money to publish?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't understand your question, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. At its inception we didn't have any money.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When you publish books, you have to have some capital of\r\nsome kind.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The capital was raised from the sale of a book called\r\n\"Walker Speaks Unmuzzled\" which sells for 35 cents. We started with\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You published that first?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who published that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe General Walker did.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And how much money came from the sale of those books?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I do not know offhand, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. We are still selling them.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Beg pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. We are still selling them.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But you handle the funds, don't you, for the company?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; but I don't know specific items.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I am not asking you for specific items. But I would\r\nlike to know approximately how much money.\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way: How much money have you handled for that\r\ncompany in the last--since it has been established?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Oh, as a rough estimate, $10,000 to $15,000.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And only a hundred dollars of that was contributions from\r\noutsiders?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say that would be it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And was there any of that $10,000 or $15,000 that came\r\nfrom any individual other than from people who purchased the hooks?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; at one time the General put some more money into the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How much money did he put into it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is all?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anybody else put any money into it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, may I revert to the other subject\r\nmatter? I have an additional question I would like to ask. And I warn\r\nthe witness in advance I am returning to the pamphlet.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your questions have stimulated me to ask another question.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were any of the funds that reached Eagle Publishing Co. by\r\nway of contributions or proceeds of sale of materials employed or used\r\nto pay for the leaflet, Commission Exhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Now, I understand that if I answer that question, it opens\r\nup the whole thing again. So I decline to answer on the grounds it may\r\nincriminate me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, I have asked our Chief Counsel, Mr. Rankin, to\r\nhave a search of our files made and our telephone calls to see if we\r\nhave received anything from Congressman Alger concerning this book. And\r\nMr. Rankin, will you report to us what your finding is, please?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I had a search made of our files, and any incoming calls\r\nfrom the Congressman to see if we had received any such material, and\r\nsuch a search showed that we had not received any such material. I\r\nthen called Congressman Alger's office to ask there if there had been\r\nany communication from them, and was informed that they had not sent\r\nanything to us, but that one of the booklets had been given away by\r\nCongressman Alger, and they had one left, and I have sent for that one\r\nto have for our records.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I would like to see it when it gets here. You\r\nexpect it pretty soon?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I sent him on the run.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Good.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Surrey, I will return to the General Walker incident\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI would like you particularly to examine the next photograph, which\r\nappears in Commission Exhibit No. 4, Item 6, as subletter P-5.\r\n\r\nThis depicts, Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen, a railroad track--in the far\r\ndistance a tall building. Is that area at all familiar to you?\r\n\r\nThat is undoubtedly the MKT line, or some spur line.\r\n\r\nYou are familiar with the MKT line, are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This I do not recognize the area.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will ask you this. Is there a railroad near General\r\nWalker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Facing out of the house, facing Turtle Creek, across the\r\ncreek, and then another half block or so, there is a railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Within a half a block?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, it would be a full city block to the railroad.\r\nPerhaps even more. I have never been in that area, as a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Having that in mind, I show you a photograph, aerial view\r\nphotograph, which we have marked Commission Exhibit No. 998.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, that is a copy of the exhibit.\r\n\r\nThat purports to be an aerial photograph taken of the vicinity of\r\nGeneral Walker's residence. And you will notice there is an encircled\r\nbuilding and the designation \"A.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, do you recognize that general area?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 998 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And does the encirclment of the home there appear to be\r\nGeneral Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; it does. I don't see a house that should be in\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say corner--you mean----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Right there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the left?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; there is a house there between Walker's residence and\r\nthe next house, and the street here, which is Avondale, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you are talking about the street here--you are pointing\r\nto a street that runs obliquely from left to right towards the upper\r\ncorner of the picture?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the left of the house encircled as General Walker's\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes. Oh, I see, I am sorry. It is much further back from\r\nthe street. That is the house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, the house you say that is next is the one immediately\r\nto the left of the one encircled?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I was looking in this area for the houses. That is\r\ncorrect. That is General Walker's residence, as depicted in the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the house to the left is the house you thought at first\r\nwas not shown, but in fact it is shown?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And who is the owner of that home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I do not know. A doctor.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A lady doctor?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is a woman, runs the household.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Dr. Ruth Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It sounds familiar, but I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does she have a dog that is sometimes obstreperous, does a\r\nlot of barking?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; she does.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are quite familiar with that fact, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How and why did you become familiar with that fact?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Anyone approaching the house, generally her house or\r\nGeneral Walker's house, would be barked at, in the middle of the night\r\nnoises.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have approached General Walker's house, I assume,\r\nat night, have you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. If the dog is out in Dr. Jackson's yard, the dog is alerted\r\nand barks?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not so much any more. Evidently he knows who I am now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. But before the dog became familiar with you, he did\r\nbark?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What kind of a dog is it, by the way?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A small Collie, I guess--shaggy, brownish dog.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall whether or not at or about the time of the\r\nattempt on General Walker's life that dog became or was ill.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was. This was reported to me. I do not know of\r\nfirsthand knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would prefer not to have your hearsay. You have no\r\nknowledge firsthand, however?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Unless, Mr. Chairman, you desire to pursue the hearsay----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Continuing with Exhibit No. 998, and looking at the\r\nfootnotes, would you tell us whether that footnoting is accurate--A\r\nthrough G?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I am not familiar with Gilbert Street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which is designated as G?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It very well could be Gilbert Street. I just don't know the\r\nnames of those streets.\r\n\r\nYes; to the best of my knowledge that is accurate.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is a tall building to the left, rather nice-looking.\r\nAre you familiar with that building?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; there are several new ones going right up in that area.\r\nI think that is the Spa, or something.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am referring, Mr. Chief Justice, to the tall building\r\nwith a lattice design immediately to the right of the letter \"A\".\r\n\r\nWhat did you think that was?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A new development in there called 21 Turtle Creek, the Spa,\r\nor something. I only know it from newspaper ads.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Was that building in that condition or being erected\r\nin the spring of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. If that is the building I think of, it has just been\r\nfinished a month or so now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long has it been under construction?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Possibly a year, a year and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that photograph fairly depict and represent the area\r\nit shows as that area existed in the spring of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; you are missing a Jesuit high school which was here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say was here, I have to identify the spot to which\r\nyou are pointing. And the spot to which you are pointing is the open\r\nfield area that is shown immediately to the right of the building we\r\nhave identified, near which the letter \"A\" appears?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us about that.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That was the old Jesuit high school, which has been torn\r\ndown just recently. I believe just recently finished tearing it down.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. I will identify these other photographs rather\r\nquickly. In each instance, will you look at the photograph and tell us\r\nwhether the sub-lettering is correct.\r\n\r\nI have now handed the witness Commission Exhibit No. 999.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 999 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe that to be generally correct. This area of\r\nWalker's residence here is difficult----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is some distance away, and the area of Walker's\r\nresidence to which the witness referred is a circle to which the letter\r\n\"A\" is affixed?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Otherwise, this is an accurate representation of that area\r\nand as it existed in the spring of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Again, the high school is--I don't believe that that Jesuit\r\nhigh school was to the ground as it shows here, in the spring of 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I now call your attention to the building that appears\r\nimmediately to the right of the circle.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is, I believe, the same building that shows in the\r\nprevious exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you. That is just exactly what I was going to ask\r\nyou. All right. Now, would you look at Commission Exhibit No. 1000.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 1000\r\nand 1002 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are those footnotings correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; I believe they are.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you look at 1002.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; I believe they are substantially correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. For the purposes of the record, Mr. Reporter,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1000 also has a sticker on it marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1001. Would you please note in the record we will not be\r\nusing Commission Exhibit 1001. It got on there by mistake. Now, you\r\njust covered Exhibit No. 1002. Now, Exhibits Nos. 1003, 1004.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits No. 1003 and\r\n1004, respectively, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; that street previously mentioned was Avondale. That is\r\nthe street immediately to the west.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it appears on Commission Exhibit No. 1003?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you yet examined Commission Exhibit No. 1004?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The witness is now examining Commission Exhibit No. 1004.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe that is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. I will ask you a general question to be sure we\r\nhave covered all of these.\r\n\r\nCalling your attention to Commission Exhibits Nos. 998, 999, 1000,\r\n1002, 1003, and 1004, which are aerial photographs--are they aerial\r\nphotographs of the vicinity of General Walker's house?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; they are.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And do they, except for the high school matter which you\r\nhave pointed out to us--do they represent fairly the area as it was in\r\nthe spring of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I would say that is generally correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, sir. Now, the Commission is interested, Mr.\r\nSurrey, in whether there are some open areas or fields near General\r\nWalker's house in which an object such as a firearm or rifle could be\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Directly across from in front of the house--of course,\r\nTurtle Creek Boulevard, and across from Turtle Creek Boulevard is\r\nTurtle Creek itself, with a lawn area coming up to the street of 20 to\r\n30 yards in some places.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Using the blank sheet of paper I hand you, would you just\r\ngive us a diagram--a rough diagram of the area of General Walker's\r\nhouse, so that I can locate the field about which you now speak?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is not actually a field.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And we will mark that as Commission Exhibit No. 1005.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1005 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This is Turtle Creek. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, is Turtle Creek a street?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is a street, a boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Mr. Walker's residence is here. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the top of this sheet north or south, west or east? When\r\nI say that I refer to Commission Exhibit No. 1005.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This is north.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Put an arrow and the letter \"N\" at that point.\r\nNow, would you put south on the other side, and then east and west\r\nwhere they belong?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. These are not exact. They are several points off. But\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are just making a rough sketch, sir, for the purpose\r\nof helping with your testimony. You have now drawn in General Walker's\r\nhouse. Would you put in the word \"Walker\"?\r\n\r\nNow, having done that, you have now described an area--told us of an\r\narea where a firearm--a field where a firearm might be buried that is\r\nin the vicinity of General Walker's home. Would you indicate where that\r\nwould be?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Here is Turtle Creek. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are now drawing a wavy line. Would you write in there\r\n\"Turtle Creek.\" And that is a stream, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does it always have water in it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To my knowledge; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Now, this area across Turtle Creek Boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is to the south of General Walker's house.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And going down to the creek is a grassy, leafed, brushed,\r\ntree area.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is not an open field?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it is an area in which a firearm could be buried?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is down near the creek--there are rocks.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. In addition to that--here is Avondale, here is the doctor's\r\nresidence. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is Dr. Jackson's residence you have now drawn?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And this entire block here is----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are pointing to the west?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Along Turtle Creek Drive?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you put the word \"drive\" there.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Would you repeat your testimony in that\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Another block of residences----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the west?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To the west. And then you come to that field where the new\r\nbuilding is going up and the Jesuit high school was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is the new building you identified in one of the\r\nearlier exhibits, and the high school has now been torn down?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. And there was--in the spring of 1963, was there\r\na field there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; there still is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where a firearm could have been buried?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We understand there is a church, a church house, near the\r\nWalker home. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you locate it, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; directly to the east. [Witness draws.] Their driveway\r\ncomes up between the Walker house, into their parking lot [witness\r\ndraws], and here is that back alley you showed me a picture of earlier.\r\n[Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. For the purpose of the record, the witness has\r\nnow drawn in what looks like a parking lot area, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the church parking lot?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And where is the church house itself located?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This entire area. I don't know about the shape of it. But\r\nit is in this area.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Write the word \"church\" in there. [Witness does so.] What\r\nchurch is that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is a Mormon church.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And about how far distant from the Walker house is the\r\nMormon church?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is on the next lot--I would say 400 feet, maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is there intervening, if anything, between the Mormon\r\nchurch buildings and General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. In the way of a fence, you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, first; are there any buildings?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or any sheds or anything of that character?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are there any trees?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; there are trees.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it heavily or lightly wooded?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Lightly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is a fence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A wooden fence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A wooden fence--about 5-foot tall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Is that a lattice fence or a solid fence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Along this side here it is a solid fence.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say this side, you are pointing to the driveway\r\nleading to Turtle Creek Boulevard?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; the fence actually is here. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have now put--he is indicating the fence. And that is a\r\nlattice or slat fence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is a solid fence there. And then it is latticed along\r\nthe alley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which way does the front of General Walker's house face--on\r\nTurtle Creek Boulevard?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. On Turtle Creek.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. That will be helpful to us. We will just set\r\nthat exhibit aside for the moment.\r\n\r\nSome of these photographs I am now about to show you--I now show you a\r\nphotograph, Commission Exhibit No. 5, Item No. 369. Do you recognize\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I do. It is a photo of the back of General Walker's\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, returning to your plat, Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 1005, is that the side of General Walker's house that faces the\r\nchurch?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is the side--is it the side that faces Dr. Jackson's\r\nhome?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it the side that faces onto or toward Turtle Creek\r\nBoulevard?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; it is not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it the side that faces toward the alley which you have\r\ndrawn on Commission Exhibit No. 1005?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Fine. Now, you will notice in that photograph an\r\nautomobile, but no license plate, and there appears to be obliterated\r\nan area in which a license plate might have appeared on that car.\r\n\r\nNow, first, you do see the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I have seen this photo before. Mr. Barrett of the FBI\r\nin Dallas brought this to my attention.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not positively, but I think it belongs to Mr. Charles Klihr.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And who is Mr. Charles Klihr?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He is a volunteer worker of Mr. Walker's, also.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you sufficiently familiar with Mr. Charles Klihr's\r\nautomobile--you already identified it----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I did not identify it. I cannot do that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the best of your ability is all I am suggesting, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have a recollection as to whether there was a\r\nlicense plate or license plate fixture in or about the area in which\r\nthe black spot on the automobile appears?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I have seen Mr. Klihr's automobile many times. I have not\r\nseen it without a license plate, which I think I would note if it were\r\nnot there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; but located at or about in the vicinity of that black\r\nspot?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say to the best of my knowledge; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you, sir. Were you at General Walker's home the\r\nevening of the attempted assassination, or attempt on his life?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I was. After the shot. I was not there at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How soon after the shot were you there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. About 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you become aware that there had been an attempt on\r\nhis life?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He called me on the telephone at my home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And how far did you live from General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. About 2 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you immediately drove over there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What kind of an automobile do you own and drive?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. A 1961 Ford convertible.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you arrive at his home in that convertible?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What time of the day or night was this?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This was about 9 to 9:30 in the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What day? I mean date.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. April 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What year?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 1963.\r\n\r\nExcuse me. This is 1964, isn't it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. So this would----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this a year ago?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It would be 1963, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have marked a series of photographs as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 1006 through 1012.\r\n\r\n(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 1006\r\nthrough 1012, respectively, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. These purport to be photographs of portions and places\r\nin--both inside and outside General Walker's home relating to the\r\nincident in question.\r\n\r\nWould you be good enough to take them seriatim, identify them by\r\nexhibit number----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Take them how?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Seriatim, in series--commencing with Commission Exhibit\r\n1006. And tell us if you are familiar with the photograph and whether\r\nit depicts a portion of General Walker's home, and, if so, what portion.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't know what this is here in the back yard, but\r\noutside of that it looks like a picture of the window facing towards\r\nthe alley which the shot came through.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From the direction the shot came?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the marring on the molding of the window is the point\r\nof the screen and the window through which the bullet came?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you examine that that evening?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see the breach in the casement which is depicted on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1006?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I did. What is this in the back? Do you happen to know?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; I don't. But I think I can bring it out. These\r\nphotographs, I think, were taken fairly recently.\r\n\r\nHave you been at General Walker's house in the last couple of weeks?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And have you had occasion to notice whether or not any\r\nrepair whatsoever has been made or was made with respect to the marring\r\nof the molding?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't believe it has.\r\n\r\nThat looks like a stack of cardboard back there. I am not familiar with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; it looks like heavy asbestos, or some wood out in the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I am not familiar with that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, look at Exhibit No. 1007.\r\n\r\nExcuse me--the photograph Exhibit No. 1006 represents that casement in\r\nits present condition?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And also as it was when you saw it that night, April 10?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; the window was closed when I saw it that night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But the breach in the molding is the same on this\r\nphotograph as it was when you saw it that night?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, the next photograph is Exhibit No. 1007,\r\nand purports to be a photograph taken from the outside of General\r\nWalker's home with the camera pointed into his home.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It shows the same breach allegedly caused by a bullet----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is shown on Exhibit 1006?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And in the case of Exhibit No. 1006, that photograph\r\nrepresents the present condition of that casement and that window and\r\nthat screen, as well as it was when you saw it on the evening of April\r\n10, 1963? Insofar as the breach is concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I seem to recall more cobwebbing effect than it shows\r\nin the photograph.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Exhibit No. 1008 purports to be a room in General Walker's\r\nhome, and a wall with a bullet hole shown in it.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize that room?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is that a picture of one of the rooms in General\r\nWalker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where is it with respect to the room shown in Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1007?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is the same room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The same room?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; all this material has been turned around, from that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are referring in your last comment to Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1007, some pamphlet materials you see shown in that\r\nphotograph?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, turning your attention to Commission Exhibit No. 1008,\r\ndoes the wall that is shown on that exhibit face the casement window\r\nshown on Exhibit No. 1007, or is that the reverse side?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is the other wall, the other side of the room from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the wall in which the bullet entered, or the wall,\r\nthe side of the wall from which the bullet exited?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is the side of the wall that it entered.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Then I show you Commission Exhibit No. 1009.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; this is the next room now where the bullet exited.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, taking Exhibits Nos. 1008 and 1009, am I correct,\r\nsir, that Exhibit No. 1008 shows the wall on the entry side of the\r\nbullet, and Exhibit No. 1009 is the reverse side of the wall shown on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1008?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In other words, the side of the wall that the bullet exited?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nNow, this picture was taken at the time, or soon thereafter, because\r\nthis material was in this position.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nYou are able to say, from your familiarity with the condition of\r\nmatters on the evening of April 10, 1963, that both Commission\r\nexhibits----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; that one I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That Commission Exhibit No. 1009 depicts the condition of\r\nthat room, which is the room to the reverse side of Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 1008, as it was the evening of April 10, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Substantially the same; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And even including the boxes and packages of material?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You will notice in substantially the center of that exhibit\r\na rupture appears to be in the wall. Was that in fact a rupture?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was. That is where the bullet came out of the wall,\r\nand when the police came they found the bullet on top of these packages.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On top of the packages shown on Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1009. I show you Exhibit No. 1011, which appears to be a photograph of\r\na fence, lattice fence. Are you familiar with that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe it is the same type of thing as is in back of\r\nWalker's home, in the alleyway.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it not in fact a picture of the fence that is--surrounds\r\nto the rear General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't know. It is the same type, it looks the same.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It looks the same to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you made your diagram, Exhibit No. 1005, you drew a\r\nwavy line along the alley, and I think you said that was a lattice\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I drew it too far. This is Jackson's back yard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, that is all right. The lattice fence you\r\nidentified----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Is of the same type and construction.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As shown on Exhibit No. 1011?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, sir. Thank you. Is the area depicted on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1012 familiar to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It looks like a picture taken from the top of that lattice\r\nfence towards the back of Walker's home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Next is Commission Exhibit No. 1010, which is a photograph\r\nof a tire imprint. On the evening of April 10 or the next day, April\r\n11, when it was light, did you tour around General Walker's home with\r\nhim or without him? There was a search made to see----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To find some identification in the way of automobile tire\r\nimpressions?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is my impression that the police were looking primarily\r\nfor a casing from a shell. I did not see them take any----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that the particular portion of the Walker vicinity shown\r\non Commission Exhibit No. 1010 is not familiar to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I wouldn't know where it was in the area.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Those have all been formally introduced, Mr. Jenner?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; they have not, Mr. Chief Justice. If it suits your\r\nconvenience I was going to offer all exhibits at once, so I don't\r\noverlook any.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you. Some of the exhibits the witness has identified\r\nhave already been introduced. They were exhibited to Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you help us, also--I hand you a map of Dallas, which\r\nwe will mark Commission Exhibit No. 1013--or I should correct myself--I\r\nhand you what purports to be a map of Dallas.\r\n\r\nThere is indicated by brush pencil a cross in the center of that map as\r\nrepresenting the area of the residence of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker,\r\nresigned, at 4011 Turtle Creek Boulevard in Dallas.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1013 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; that is correct. That is the area.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is a scale map of Dallas that appears to have been\r\nobtained from the Dallas Transit Co. in Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you received a telephone call from General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The evening of April 10. It was about 9 o'clock? Please try\r\nto fix that time as accurately as you can.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say it was closer to 9:15.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you arrived 15 minutes later?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. 10 to 15 minutes later.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you very carefully, calling on your most\r\naccurate recollection, recite for us--you came to the door, you\r\nentered, what did you see, who was there, and what was said to you by\r\nanyone, if anyone was there--just the course of events as best you are\r\nable to recall them that evening. And I will try not to interrupt you.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. When I pulled--I pulled up in front on Turtle Creek, got\r\nout of my car. A police car was there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there anything in addition to a police car?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You pulled your car up on Turtle Creek Boulevard?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Behind the police car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you be good enough, when you refer to Turtle Creek\r\nBoulevard, to say boulevard, because we have talked about Turtle Creek,\r\na stream.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Turtle Creek Boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was one squad car there at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; just as I was getting out of the car, another squad\r\ncar came up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Turning to your plat, would you put an \"X\" with a circle\r\nwhere you drove up? The witness has now done that. All right. Now, you\r\nare on Turtle Creek Boulevard. Then what did you do? You parked?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I parked and got out of my automobile, and walked up the\r\nfront walkway into the house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. There were several policemen in the house, just arriving.\r\nMr. Walker was sitting at his desk in this back room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow it will be helpful to the Commission--let's take this blank sheet\r\nof paper--you draw us a floor plan, will you please, of General\r\nWalker's home, and we will mark that Commission Exhibit No. 1014, so as\r\nto assist you in telling us what you did.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1014 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This is the ground floor.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, first let's locate the house. It is a\r\nrectangle that you have drawn. Is the rectangle facing the same as the\r\nrectangle marked \"Walker\" on Commission Exhibit No. 1005?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that the lower portion is east?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Do we need these directions exactly, because that Turtle\r\nCreek Boulevard winds all around.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All I want to do is tie it up with Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1005.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is the same direction.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Realizing that you have that problem of obliqueness,\r\nbut relating it solely to Commission Exhibit No. 1005, the foot of\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1014 represents an easterly direction, correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the top a westerly direction. And the right, northerly,\r\nand the left, southerly. All right. Now, we have it located.\r\n\r\nWhich is the doorway into General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. This is the--this is the front door. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have now put two oblique lines on the line facing\r\nsoutherly.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And then as you enter, there is a long hallway.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And which is the rear of the house towards the alley?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Toward the north.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, in what room, if any of those rooms on the\r\nfirst floor, was General Walker the night of April 10, 1963, when this\r\nincident occurred, as you learned when you reached there?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. His desk was positioned right there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have now drawn a small but rather elongated rectangle,\r\nwhich appears to be opposite two lines you have drawn which I take it\r\nrepresents a window.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And from what you learned from General Walker on that\r\noccasion in the presence of the policemen, was he seated at the desk?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He was seated at his desk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His back to the window you have drawn, or facing the window?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To the window.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So he was facing to the window?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; his back was to the window.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was facing away from the window?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have drawn a little circle by the figure\r\nrepresenting a desk, indicating where General Walker was seated?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And facing westerly?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, locate for us, put a circle with a cross, the wall,\r\nthe side of the wall indicated by Commission Exhibit No. 1008.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is right here, sir. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, that is shown, for the purpose of the\r\nrecord, to the left of the blank circle which the witness drew to show\r\nGeneral Walker sitting at his desk. And that area that is shown on--the\r\nwall shown on Commission Exhibit No. 1009, I take it, is precisely the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The other side.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have done that by showing an area?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Then we have that located.\r\n\r\nDid General Walker in your presence relate what occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us what he said about how it occurred, when he became\r\naware of it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I walked in the front door, and there were several\r\npolicemen standing around in various areas. I walked in through here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say \"through here\" [witness draws two lines to\r\nrepresent door.]----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Through the front----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You came in from the south, the front, and you went down\r\nthe hallway?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is not really a hallway. It is mostly glass doors here.\r\nAnd I walked through those glass doors.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have put three strikes on your sketch. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Those are glass doors.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You walked through the glass doorway. You walked into\r\nthe room, the wall of which is shown on Commission Exhibit No. 1009.\r\nCorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And I went right through this room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Into the room in which General Walker's desk is located?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The wall of which on that side appears shown on Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1008?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The General was sitting at his desk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. When I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he facing----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He was----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Westerly?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, talking to a policeman in uniform. And I walked in and\r\nI said, \"What happened? What's going on?\" And he pointed to this hole\r\nin the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Shown on Commission Exhibit No. 1008?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes. And I facetiously said, \"Oh, you found a bug.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you explain your facetious remark? I don't get the\r\nfact that it is facetious.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, actually, it may not be. It is a common joke around\r\nthe General's house that there may be microphones.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That kind of a bug?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is, you saw the hole in the wall and you remarked\r\nfacetiously that he had discovered the house had been bugged by an\r\nelectronic device?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; and, therefore, had chopped a hole in the wall.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"No; I have been shot at.\" And he pointed to the hole in\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which is shown on Commission Exhibits Nos. 1007 and 1006?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct. Except the window was closed at this\r\ntime--both casements were together.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; and there is a screen on that window?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I believe there is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And then----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, sir. That would be the window which is the lower\r\nof the two sets of strikes appearing on the northerly line of your\r\nExhibit No. 1014.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes. I will mark it with an \"A\" and a circle.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Good.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And then a policeman asked him a question, and I noticed\r\nthat his arm was bleeding.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. General Walker's arm?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. General Walker's arm, was bleeding in four or five places.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How was he dressed?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. In a dress shirt of a color, as I recall, but it was not a\r\nsport shirt--and slacks.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was not a uniform of any character?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; and without a tie.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Short sleeved or long sleeved?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Long sleeved, rolled up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And his right arm, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. His right arm, yes; on his forearm. And----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he bleeding profusely?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No. And he said \"The jacket of the bullet must have come\r\napart when it went through the window.\" And he brushed plaster--I\r\nassume it came from this wall--out of his hair, which was in his hair,\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What color hair does General Walker have?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Brown; a dark brown.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He has a fairly full head of hair, does he?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And plaster and that sort of thing would be quite apparent,\r\nwould it, to anyone who saw it in his hair?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you noticed it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you noticed him brushing plaster out of his hair?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, that leads me to ask you this, Mr. Surrey: That bullet\r\nhole is how high from the floor? I am showing you now Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1009.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. You mean how high is the hole----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. From the floor? Well, the police went into the next room\r\nand so did I, and sighted through the hole in the wall to the window.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. And when Walker sat down at his desk, it went right through\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So he was seated on a chair substantially the height of the\r\none you are seated on?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, and he is approximately a little taller than I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He is a little taller than you are. So that would be about\r\n4, 4-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\nTell the Commission the distance from the wall, the point at which\r\nyou have marked an \"X\" with a circle, and the place at which General\r\nWalker's chair was located.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say 18 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was that close?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. To the wall there; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that the representation you have made on Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1014 is distorted?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it is. The desk was right up against the wall, and he\r\nwas seated in the middle of the desk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His chair was much closer to the wall than would appear to\r\nhave been as you have roughly diagramed on Exhibit No. 1014?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. In other words, he was close enough to the wall\r\nwhen seated at that chair so that when a bullet penetrating the plaster\r\nwall could have splattered plaster into his hair?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Proceed, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. So I went over and looked at his arm, and there was a piece\r\nof metal in one particular spot in his arm, that I noticed, in addition\r\nto the other scratches, and I went looking for some first aid equipment\r\nand found tweezers upstairs, and came back downstairs and picked that\r\npiece of metal and two others out of his right forearm.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what was done with those pieces of metal?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. They were--I believe the police took them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you recall that you, in fact, yourself took the pieces\r\nof metal from General Walker's right forearm?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And--all right. Go ahead, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, then it became just a matter of the police\r\nquestioning the general and myself. I don't recall which detective or\r\nwhich policemen and myself went out in the back and looked in the back\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that what you did next, after you took the metal out of\r\nGeneral Walker's forearm?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You immediately went out of the house----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not immediately; no. We talked. I would say within 2 or 3\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you did not go into any other room? That is what I am\r\ngetting at first. You went outside first?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't recall if we went in the other room then or later\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say the other room, it is the room opposite the\r\none and to the left of the one shown on your diagram----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. As I recall, I merely looked around the separation here\r\nwhen they said that the bullet came clear through into the other room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who said that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. One of the policemen.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you go around and look then?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I just looked around the doorway; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you find when you looked around--what did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I saw these books stacked, as shown in this picture.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Identify the picture, please.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Exhibit No. 1009.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had--you mentioned a bullet as having been found.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, the policeman said he had found that bullet, on top of\r\nthe packages.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Shown in Exhibit No. 1009?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that portion of the bullet exhibited to you on that\r\noccasion?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did not see it?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was the statement that the bullet had been found on the\r\nopposite side of that wall made in the presence of General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did General Walker say when that statement was made in\r\nhis presence, if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't recall that he made any statement.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say anything about where the spent bullet had been\r\nfound?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not at that time, no. Not to me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, did he say it to an officer in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it uttered by him at all in your presence on that\r\nevening?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is, that the spent bullet had been found on the\r\nopposite side of the wall next to which he had been sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I think the policeman said it, and that is all that was\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it was said in General Walker's presence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did the policeman say?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He said the bullet went clean through the wall and they\r\nfound it laying on the packages in the other room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say they found it or \"I found it\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He said, \"I found it\" as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Proceed in your chronology, please.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is all there was to it. Then he started getting calls\r\nfrom newsmen, and newsmen coming to the door.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. First, you went out and looked around the premises.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; but it was quite dark at this time, and they said, \"We\r\nwill come back in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I should have asked you this. Perhaps I just assumed it.\r\nWas it dark when you arrived at General Walker's home?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When does it get dark in Dallas, Tex., in this area in the\r\nspring?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I would say 7.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have daylight saving time in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; we don't.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you are on what time?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Central standard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Central standard time?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It is 2 hours from here.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Two hours from here when we have daylight savings.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. You have daylight saving now?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Only 1 hour then.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After looking around, you say newspapermen began to come.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And interview General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And in the presence of the policemen?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you leave General Walker's home that night?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I stayed that night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear General Walker being interviewed?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say about what had occurred, if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. He said, \"Somebody took a shot at me.\" This is the general\r\ntenor of the interviews as to what happened, and he said, \"Somebody\r\ntook a shot at me.\" I guess--\"That is the closest I have ever been\r\nmissed in 30 years of military service.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say anything about whether he was seated--whether he\r\nhad been moving about?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; he said he had been seated at his desk when it\r\nhappened. Working on his income tax.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, Mr. Surrey, was there an occasion preceding\r\nOctober--April 10, 1963, that you noticed an automobile and some people\r\nin the automobile in and about General Walker's premises?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; that was 2 nights before, on Monday evening.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would be April 10?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I mean April 8, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. April 8; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What time?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. About 8:30 to 9. I am not sure about what time it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it, then, it was dark?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And tell the Commission what led up to that, what you said,\r\nand what you did. This incident that you have in mind.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I was coming from my home, came down Turtle Creek\r\nBoulevard, passed in front of the general's house, and took a\r\nright-hand turn on Avondale, to come up to the alley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have we put Avondale into your plat? You are now turning to\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1005. [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The normal route into the parking lot behind the general's\r\nhouse----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He does have a parking lot?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; this is the parking area back in here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you crossline that, so we know it is the parking\r\nlot? [Witness draws.]\r\n\r\nThat is fine.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I came up Turtle Creek Boulevard and turned right on\r\nAvondale prior to turning again up the alleyway, to go into the parking\r\nlot in back of General Walker's house. And I noticed a car parked 30\r\nfeet--about 20 yards actually----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have now drawn a rectangle on the edge of the sheet of\r\npaper, Exhibit No. 1005, marked with the letter \"N.\" Would you write\r\nthe word \"car\" in there?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What is this designed to establish, Mr. Jenner? We are\r\ngetting a little afield, it seems to me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Surrey, Mr. Chief Justice, was interviewed and related\r\nthis particular incident, and we want to dissipate any possibility--I\r\ndon't want to put it this way----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If it has some relevancy, all right. But let's don't take\r\ntoo long, because it is getting to be quite collateral. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Well, the gist of the matter is that two nights before\r\nthe assassination attempt, I saw two men around the house peeking in\r\nwindows and so forth, and reported this to the general the following\r\nmorning, and he, in turn, reported it to the police on Tuesday, and it\r\nwas Wednesday night that he was shot at. So that is really the gist of\r\nthe whole thing.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you an exhibit marked Garner Exhibit No. 1. At\r\nanytime prior to April 10, 1963, were you familiar with the person who\r\nis shown on Garner Exhibit No. 1?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When I say familiar, I mean did you know of or had you seen\r\nconsciously a person with that physiognomy and physical appearance?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is a side view.\r\n\r\nI show you Commission Exhibit No. 520. The man in the center--had you\r\nprior to April 10, 1963, ever seen a man with that physiognomy, facial\r\nshowing, and body?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, sir. I take it, then--I ask you this question.\r\nNeither of the two men that you saw in that automobile on the 8th of\r\nApril 1963, at least to your present recollection, was the man shown on\r\nGarner Exhibit No. 1, and Commission Exhibit No. 520?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. I don't believe either of them was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May I ask--is this what you spoke of as the book?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I notice on here that there is no price of any kind. You\r\nsay you sold this for $5?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That was an afterthought. The original intent was not a\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Was it ever advertised to the public as for sale from $5?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where was it advertised?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. In just a flier that we included with some materials we\r\nwere mailing out.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see. I would like to ask you if you were present\r\nwhen--at the time that they had--that there was the demonstration\r\nagainst Ambassador Adlai Stevenson?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No; I was not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you have anything to do with that demonstration?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Were you present when the demonstration was against then\r\nVice President Johnson in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you have anything to do with that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, we have marked the book as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1015.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1015 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please examine it? You need no more than just\r\nto look at it, so you will be able to testify that that is a true and\r\ncorrect copy of the book you have testified about, published by Eagle\r\nPublishing Co., which contains on its reverse cover side the letter to\r\nwhich you made reference.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What did it cost you to publish that?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It came to $2.50 and some cents. In a limited\r\nquantity--3,000.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you now propose to offer all of the exhibits?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; I have three more FBI photos, and then I will have\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Surrey, I show you three more photographs which are\r\nidentified first as Commission Exhibit No. 997. Would you read the\r\nmaterial that appears on the reverse side of that first, please?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 997 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Looking now at the face of the photograph, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 997, does--do the inscriptions on the reverse side\r\ncorrectly describe that area of General Walker's home and the Mormon\r\nchurch references?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; they do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are familiar with that area?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nJENNER. And its physical appearance, except for the foliage on the\r\ntrees, is as that area looked on the night of April 10, 1963? Is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1016.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1016 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Read the inscription on the reverse side, please. You are\r\nfamiliar with that area shown on the photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do the descriptions on the reverse side of the photograph\r\ncorrectly describe that area?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. With the exception that I do not know these cars and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am talking about the area.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. The physical area; yes, they do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that area looks the same today as it did on the evening\r\nof April 10, or the day of April 10, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I now hand you the last of these, Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1017, and ask you first to read the inscription and then examine the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1017 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir; these are substantially correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As of today, as well as as of April 10, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Chief Justice, I offer in evidence the various exhibits which\r\nwe have identified in the record with the exhibit numbers, and ask that\r\nthe exhibits take the exhibit numbers I recited in each instance as to\r\neach exhibit, being Exhibits Nos. 996 through 1000 and 1002 through\r\n1017.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may all be admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 996 through\r\n1000 and 1002 through 1017 were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That includes, Mr. Chief Justice, the diagrams which the\r\nwitness has prepared for us.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As I reported to you, Mr. Chief Justice, the file on the\r\nWalker incident reached us about 20 minutes before we opened this\r\nmorning. I think I have covered everything. Could I have the privilege\r\nof 5 minutes to take a look?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will do it very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who is Mr. Coleman? Do you know a man by that name?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not personally.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Walker Kirk Coleman.\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. As I just read on the back of your exhibit, he is the\r\nboy that reported seeing several automobiles at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is immaterial to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou have never seen either of the two men you have mentioned before or\r\nsince the occasion you saw that automobile with the two men in it on\r\nthe evening of April 8, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Not to my knowledge. I never was very close to them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you able to--what kind of an automobile was it, do you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It was a Ford, a new Ford at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Sedan?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Four-door sedan.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it was new?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To your knowledge, have you ever seen that automobile\r\nbefore or since?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What color was it, if you noticed?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. It was either a dark brown or a maroon.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You followed it awhile and then gave up the chase?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. That is correct. Actually, they made a turn which--I\r\nam familiar with downtown Dallas--and they made a turn which would\r\nindicate they were doubling back or not going in a straight direction.\r\nAnd I thought perhaps I had been spotted in my convertible. So I left\r\nthem there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will close, Mr. Chief Justice, by asking the witness--was\r\nthe Mormon church in session? Had there been----\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. There had been services.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The evening of April 10?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. They were still dispersing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you arrived at approximately 9:30 in the evening of\r\nApril 10, were people still leaving the Mormon church?\r\n\r\nMr. SURREY. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have no more questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That will be all, Mr. Surrey. You may be excused now.\r\n\r\nThe Commission is adjourned.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, June 18, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES J. ROWLEY AND ROBERT CARSWELL\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9 a.m., on June 18, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and\r\nAllen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; and Samuel A. Stern,\r\nassistant counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES J. ROWLEY\r\n\r\n(Members present at this point: Chief Justice Earl Warren.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nChief, it is our procedure to read a little statement as to the purpose\r\nof the meeting, for the benefit of the witness.\r\n\r\nChief Rowley will be asked to testify with respect to the protective\r\nmeasures taken by the Secret Service in Dallas, changes in such\r\nmeasures made as a result of the Dallas experience, and with regard to\r\nthe investigation of the assassination and any information he may have\r\nrespecting the assassination of the President.\r\n\r\nWould you raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nYou solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please. Mr. Rankin will conduct the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, before starting the examination, I would\r\nlike to make a brief statement for your benefit and for the benefit of\r\nthe Commission, of the problems that are probably going to develop in\r\nthis area with regard to the security of the country, and a suggestion\r\nabout how we might handle them as we proceed with the witness.\r\n\r\nI have suggested to Chief Rowley that as he moves along in his\r\ntestimony he might have various matters that he would think should\r\nnot be on the record because of the security of the country, and\r\nif he would just suggest that, when he came to that point, and say\r\nspecifically that it did involve the security of the country, then\r\nwe would proceed to go off the record, if it was satisfactory to the\r\nCommission, and consider those questions off the record. And then\r\nreturn to the record as soon as we had completed those security matters.\r\n\r\nWould that be satisfactory?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that is an appropriate way to proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, will you state your name and address for the\r\nrecord, please?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. James J. Rowley, 3501 Rittenhouse Street NW., Washington,\r\nD.C.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have an official position with the Government?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have, as Chief of the U.S. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you occupied that position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Since September 1, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What is the nature of the duties of that position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The nature of the duties is the general overall supervision\r\nof the activities of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And, in a general way, what is the official responsibility\r\nunder the statutes of the United States of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we are responsible under title 18, section 3056,\r\nto investigate all violations that affect the currency, securities,\r\nand coinage of the United States. That involves Government bonds,\r\nGovernment checks, and such other functions and duties as are\r\nauthorized by law, subject to the direction of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have the responsibility of the protection of the\r\nPresident, members of his immediate family, the Vice President,\r\nPresident-elect, Vice President-elect, and the former President for a\r\nreasonable period of time as he leaves office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you please tell us what experience you had with the\r\nSecret Service prior to the time that you became chief.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I was in charge of the White House detail from 1946 to 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you tell us briefly the training that you had in\r\nregard to Government Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I first entered the Government as a member of the FBI\r\nin 1937, and spent a year with the FBI, after which I went back to\r\nNew York for a period of 9 months. I entered the Secret Service on\r\nSeptember 12, 1938. I spent time in criminal investigation in the New\r\nYork City office, and the Utica office of Secret Service and in April\r\nof 1939, I was assigned to Washington, eventually to the White House\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I served as a member of the White House detail, as an agent\r\non a shift, as an assistant agent in charge, agent in charge of the\r\nshift, and advance man, in preparing for Presidential visits, both\r\ndomestically and abroad.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What educational training did you have?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I had 2 years of college toward a B.S., then I was\r\ngraduated from law school, and secured a master's degree in law.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was one of the duties of your position as chief of the\r\nService to have general supervision over the trip of President Kennedy\r\nand Vice President Johnson to Dallas around November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, that would be part of my job--the general supervision\r\nof the trip. The actual direct supervision would have been under the\r\njurisdiction of Mr. Behn, who was in charge of the White House detail.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you describe briefly the nature of Mr. Behn's\r\nresponsibilities in that work?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, it would have been, as mine was in the period I was\r\nthere, that he was responsible for developing all arrangements with\r\nthe members of the White House staff, designating the members of the\r\ndetail to develop advance work, assigning agents to the various shifts,\r\ndirecting their training as it applied to the White House detail,\r\nand participating in any event that he thought would be necessary in\r\nconnection with his work at the White House.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you become familiar with what did happen on that trip,\r\nin your position as chief?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; I was first informed while addressing a graduating\r\nclass of our Secret Service school on that day. I was summoned by Mr.\r\nBehn to the White House, at which time he told me that the President\r\nhad been shot. He was then at the hospital, and subsequently we were\r\nnotified that the President had died; that the Vice President would\r\ntake the oath of office in the airplane at Love Field.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I asked my deputy, who was in his office while I\r\nwas at the White House, to arrange with the Immigration Service to\r\nclose the border, Texas being in close proximity to the border. There\r\nmight have been a conspiracy or something, we didn't want to take\r\nany chances. And then I immediately dispatched an inspector from my\r\nstaff to the Capitol to protect the Speaker, and directed the other\r\nactivities as we got the information from Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you learn in connection with the trip when the\r\nassassination occurred that certain of the Secret Service agents had\r\nbeen in the press club and what is called the Cellar, at Fort Worth,\r\nthe night before?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, that came to my attention through a broadcast that\r\nMr. Pearson made, that the agents were inebriated the night before at\r\nthe Fort Worth Press Club. I immediately dispatched Inspector McCann to\r\nFort Worth to investigate the report, and to interview the agents.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you learn?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I learned that there were nine agents involved at the Press\r\nClub. And I might say this--the agents on duty throughout that day\r\nhad no opportunity to eat. When they arrived at Fort Worth, they were\r\ninformed that there was a buffet to be served at the Fort Worth Club.\r\nThis is what I ascertained in personal interviews. Upon going over\r\nthere, they learned there was no buffet, and some of them stayed for\r\na drink. Three, I think, had one Scotch, and others had two or three\r\nbeers. They were in and out--from the time they arrived, I would say\r\nroughly around 12:30, until the place closed at 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\nNow, after that some of them went to the Cellar. This is a place that\r\ndoes not serve alcoholic beverages. They went there primarily, I think,\r\nout of curiosity, because this was some kind of a beatnik place where\r\nsomeone gets up and recites, or plays the guitar.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you learn whether or not there were any violations of\r\nthe regulations of the Secret Service by these men?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; there was a violation. At that time there was a\r\nsection in our manual in effect that said that during----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you give us first the number?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Section 10.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that chapter 1, page 7?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Chapter 1, page 7; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you tell the Commission about what the regulation\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. \"The use of liquor. Employees are strictly enjoined to\r\nrefrain from the use of intoxicating liquor during the hours they are\r\nofficially employed at their post of duty or when they may reasonably\r\nexpect that they may be called upon to perform an official duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe one that applies here--\"However, all members of the White House\r\ndetail and special agents cooperating with them on presidential and\r\nsimilar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for\r\nofficial duty at any time while in travel status. Therefore, the use of\r\nintoxicating liquor of any kind, including beer and wine, by members\r\nof the White House detail and special agents cooperating with them or\r\nby special agents on similar assignments, while they are in a travel\r\nstatus, is prohibited.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell the Commission how many men were involved in\r\nthese trips to the Press Club and the Cellar, where these things were\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. There were 9 men involved at the Press Club, and there were\r\n10 men involved at the Cellar.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, how many men, of those 10 men, were in the\r\nPresidential motorcade on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Four--four men were in the followup car.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know their names?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; Landis, Hill, Ready, and Bennett.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you make any investigation to determine whether or not\r\ntheir violation of the Secret Service regulations had anything to do\r\nwith the assassination of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes. They performed their duties from the time they\r\ndeparted in the followup car from Love Field until the point of the\r\ntragedy in a most satisfactory manner. There was nothing deficient in\r\ntheir actions or their alertness. They went through the heaviest part\r\nof downtown Dallas, through the crowds, and performed in an exemplary\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. From the reports that I got from their superiors.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In the work that you did with the White House detail before\r\nyou became Chief of the Secret Service, did you know the various\r\nresponsibilities of the members of the White House detail?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever participate in such motorcades yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How much?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I have participated, in rough numbers, over a period\r\nof 22 years--roughly, maybe, a thousand or more.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you briefly describe the functions of the Secret\r\nService agents in connection with the President's car?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you finished this other matter?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No; I just wanted to----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. When the President's car leaves the airport or a railroad\r\nstation or any other location, the agents accompany him to the car and\r\nstand to the right and left, in the same order as their designated\r\npositions on the followup car, and screen him. And then the car moves\r\nout, slowly, because the rest of the cars have to have an opportunity\r\nto follow in the motorcade, so that none lingers behind, or is left\r\nbehind. And then the agent in the lead car determines that the\r\nmotorcade is intact and is moving, then he steps up his speed, which is\r\na cue to the Presidential driver to step up his speed, and then they go\r\nat a speed consistent with the crowd that is there, and so forth.\r\n\r\nNow, upon leaving the airport, if there is a huge crowd there, the\r\nmen are still on the ground running on the right and left side of the\r\nPresident, both rear and front of the vehicle. After they get out of\r\nthe crowd, then the men in the front beside the Presidential vehicle\r\ndrop back and take their positions in the followup car.\r\n\r\nThis is so that they are not in the way of the men running on the right\r\nand left rear. They move back last and have a clear opportunity to jump\r\nonboard the followup car in the event the speed of the motorcade is\r\nstepped up.\r\n\r\nWhen the motorcade comes to intersections or turns which are always\r\nvulnerable points, in that if you make a right turn, that is the\r\nclosest point for someone to come out, the agents on the right side\r\nbefore reaching that point, will jump off, to be available alongside\r\nthe President's car in the event someone darts out with some malicious\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThere have also been times when, innocently, ladies and young people\r\nwill come out to throw a bouquet of flowers. And then if there is a\r\ncrowd that is sparse, they return to their position in the followup car.\r\n\r\nNow, when they come into a big crowd, they take it on foot, and at a\r\nlittle jog, if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, if the crowd continues for a prolonged distance,\r\nthe agents work together. In other words, there are rear steps on the\r\nright and left rear of the Presidential car with handrails. These have\r\ntwo purposes. One, for agents to ride on and to screen the President\r\nfrom anything from above; the second, in a situation like this, to keep\r\nan additional man available in case of trouble, and also to alternate\r\nwith the men to the right rear of the President, who are jogging along\r\nwarding off the crowd.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, what positions did the four men that you referred to\r\nthat were involved in the press club and the Cellar matter occupy on\r\nthe day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, Mr. Ready occupied the right front, Mr. Landis to his\r\nrear----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you mean by right front?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Right front running board position of the followup car. It\r\nwas his responsibility or duty to jump off in crowds and to take the\r\nposition at the right rear of the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. Landis, if necessary, to jump off if the occasion demanded and take\r\nthe right front of the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. Hill was on the left front running board of the followup car, and\r\nhis responsibility was at the rear of the President's car. His position\r\nwas assigned there because he was in charge of the First Lady's detail,\r\nand she was seated on the left side.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. McIntyre was to his rear on the left running board. So his\r\nassignment would have been up to the left front of the President's car.\r\nMr. Bennett was in the rear seat of the followup car.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, how can you tell that the fact that they were out as\r\nthey were the night before and violated the regulations, had nothing to\r\ndo with the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, based on the reports of my investigating agents and\r\nthe facts as to how they performed at the time of the tragedy. Mr.\r\nHill, who was on the left side, responded immediately--as he looked\r\ntoward the Presidential car, being on the left side, he scanned from\r\nleft to right, and when he saw there was something happening to the\r\nPresident following a noise, he immediately jumped from his position to\r\nget aboard from his side.\r\n\r\nMr. Ready scanned to the right so he was looking away from the\r\nPresident, because he was looking around from the right side. As a\r\nconsequence, he wasn't aware of what was happening in the front. The\r\ncar was also going on a turn at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What about the other two?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The other two were watching--they reacted normally--the man\r\non the left side looked to his left rear, and the man, Landis, looked\r\nto his right rear.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you done anything to discipline these men for\r\nviolation of the regulations of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I did consider what type of punishment would be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nThen I also considered the fact that these men in no way had--their\r\nconduct had no bearing on the assassination. And, therefore, I thought\r\nthat in the light of history, to place a stigma on them by punishing\r\nthem at that time, from which inevitably the public would conclude that\r\nthey were responsible for the assassination of the President--I didn't\r\nthink this was fair, and that they did not deserve that, with their\r\nfamily and children.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask one question there?\r\n\r\nYou described the assignment of the four men with respect to the\r\nfollowup car and the President's car. Do they have different\r\nassignments with regard to watching what is happening around them, or\r\ndoes that depend on the circumstances in which they are?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Both. When they start off they have a certain area that\r\nthey have to watch. Like the man in the right front would naturally\r\nwatch slightly to the right and in front of him. The fellow on the\r\nside, behind him, will watch to the right and rear. In other words,\r\nas they are going by a building, he should scan the building. In the\r\nmeantime, he picks up where the man in the front has finished. In other\r\nwords, the scan of the man in the front will cover the building to his\r\nfront and side; the fellow behind will scan alongside from rear to\r\nforward. Their scanning joins. This is the way they are accustomed to\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who would cover straight ahead?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The man in the front seat has that responsibility.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, how do you construe subparagraph (c) of your\r\nregulation 10 regarding the use of alcoholic liquors?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you read it for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you kindly read it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. \"Violation or slight disregard of the above paragraphs\r\nor the excessive or improper use of intoxicating liquor at any time\r\nwill be cause for removal from the service. In interpreting the words\r\n'excessive' and 'improper,' slight evidence tending to indicate\r\nunusual or questionable conduct will be considered proof that the use\r\nof liquor has been improper or excessive. Association with others who\r\ndrink to excess will be considered as an indication of using more\r\nthan a moderate amount of liquor. The excuse that liquor was used for\r\nmedicinal purposes will not be accepted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How do you construe and apply that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, in this instance, it was wrong.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, were these men under this regulation considered to be\r\non travel status, so that they should not be using intoxicating liquor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And there is no question about that in your mind?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Has anything been done to reprimand and cause them to\r\nrealize that this is a violation of your regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They were interviewed by the inspector at the time. The\r\nseriousness of the matter was impressed upon them. And I think they\r\nrecognize the seriousness of their acts.\r\n\r\nThe men we recruit are men that are college graduates and mature,\r\nand we screen them very carefully, particularly before we assign\r\nthem to the White House detail. They know and we know that they are\r\nin a fishbowl 24 hours a day, and that, therefore, their conduct\r\nis always subject to scrutiny, and so forth, and that they are\r\nresponsible individuals. Their records have indicated that they have\r\nbeen performing in a high degree. They have worked endless hours of\r\novertime. They are dedicated. And if they were not, they would not be\r\non the detail.\r\n\r\nThey realize the seriousness of the violation, and I went over it with\r\nmy special agent in charge. He understands it. And I am quite sure that\r\nthey all understand it at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would like to have you examine Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1018, Chief Rowley, and see if that is the regulation of the Secret\r\nService that you have been referring to.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; that is what I have been reading here, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to offer as a part of the\r\nrecord the regulation, Commission Exhibit No. 1018.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may he admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked for identification as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1018, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, have you had any other complaints similar\r\nto this in regard to the conduct of the Secret Service agents on the\r\nPresidential or White House detail?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We had one in the last month. We had charges leveled at us\r\nby an agent of the Secret Service----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us about that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Who is currently under indictment, and who will be brought\r\nto trial on criminal charges on the 29th of June. And, for that reason,\r\nwhile I have no reluctance to discuss it, I think we should go off the\r\nrecord, because I don't want to in any way prejudice the case.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. There is no reason to discuss that case here, Chief.\r\n\r\nIs there anything in particular that would affect this situation you\r\nwanted to know about, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, the only thing would be the\r\ninvestigation as to whether or not there was comparable conduct.\r\nI didn't know whether the Commission would like to know what that\r\ninvestigation was and what the results of it were.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I suppose there is no objection to the Chief\r\ntelling us what this complaint was, but not insofar as it bears on the\r\ncrime that he is charged with.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, it ties in with the crime, because he said he was\r\nframed.\r\n\r\nNow, he said he was framed because he was prepared to go before your\r\nCommission, sir, to testify about this thing that happened 3 years\r\nago, and in the charges he said he advised me, as well as others, and\r\nnothing was done. He said he was framed for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Had he ever made any complaint to you before?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. He had never made any complaint to me. It came as a\r\ncomplete surprise.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The complaint to you came subsequent to the filing\r\nof criminal charges against him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. He said he had made the charges at the time the alleged\r\nincidents occurred, Mr. Congressman, that he notified me, before he\r\nleft an assignment 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nLet me give you the background, so there is no misunderstanding. We\r\nhave what we call an orientation program. The men we recruit from the\r\ncolleges, and the type of men that we want, we cannot always get off\r\nthe civil service roster. Therefore, we have an understanding with\r\nCivil Service that we can take men under schedule A. Within a period of\r\n2 years, they will have to be assigned to the White House or dropped\r\nfrom the Service.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to determine their ability and fitness for assignment,\r\nsince some people are better criminal investigators than they are in\r\nprotection work, we have an orientation program which includes duty\r\non the White House detail. Mr. Bolden was one of the men selected to\r\ncome in the summer of 1961. He was also a replacement for some regular\r\nagent on the detail who was on leave. It was a 30-day assignment. This\r\nafforded us an opportunity to observe him, determine whether he was\r\nequipped and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd he was on the White House detail for this short period of time. The\r\ntime that he describes was a 5-day weekend up in Hyannis Port.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I don't think that quite answers----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I am giving the background.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think the question is as to when you got the complaint.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well--excuse me. [Continuing.] Before he left his detail\r\nassignment, you see, he alleges that he told me about the condition\r\nthat was going on up in Hyannis.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Before he left on this 30-day assignment?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. When he left to return to his office in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And what is the fact in that regard?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The fact is he never informed me. He never informed any of\r\nhis supervisors or anyone on the detail.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think the record should show, Mr. Chairman, that we\r\nwere never advised that he wanted to testify, nor had we any inquiry\r\nor anything about the matter, until after we learned about it in the\r\nnewspapers. And, even then, he didn't ask to testify. And we asked the\r\nFBI to check into it, and he had counsel, and they refused to tell\r\nanything about the matter at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question?\r\n\r\nDid I understand you to say that the Civil Service prescribes that\r\ncertain men must be assigned to the White House for a certain detail?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, Mr. Dulles; we have an arrangement with the Civil\r\nService that they will permit us to recruit these men, not from\r\nthe register, but under what they call schedule A. They give us an\r\nopportunity, 2 years, to train these men, with the understanding that\r\nwithin 2 years' time they will have to be assigned to the White House\r\ndetail or we will not be able to retain them in the Service.\r\n\r\nHowever, during that 2 years, we urge them to take the civil service\r\nexamination, so that they get on the register. And then when they\r\ndo--quite frequently this occurs--they are selected from the register,\r\nand once they become permanent, if they are not interested in the White\r\nHouse detail, then they continue their work as a criminal investigator\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But if they do not take that special examination, then--and\r\nbecome a part of the civil service, then they have to be assigned to\r\nthe White House, to stay on?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I was a little worried when you said certain people had\r\nto be assigned to the White House, that you were under compulsion to\r\nassign certain people to the White House in order to retain them.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; anyone who works in the White House, whether he is\r\nan electrician, a painter, or anything, for a period of 2 years, he\r\nautomatically becomes eligible for permanent civil service status.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that by law or by regulation?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That I cannot say. I would always interpret it as under\r\nlaw. I may be wrong on that, Mr. Ford, but this is what happens. When\r\nour men spend 2 years on the detail at the White House, they come\r\nwithin that classification.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief, can you clarify Commissioner Dulles' inquiry? The\r\nCivil Service does not direct that you put certain people in the White\r\nHouse?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Oh, no; we do that in order to--I see your point, sir. We\r\ndo that in order to give them the permanency that they should have to\r\ncontinue their employment with the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But that is the choice of the Secret Service rather than\r\nanybody else?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I gather the Civil Service prescribed if they did not do\r\nthis, they could not be retained. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. In other words----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is some pressure, I should think.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. There is no pressure, because we voluntarily entered into\r\nan agreement with them, sir, for this arrangement, explaining that we\r\nfrequently don't get from the register the type of men that we want,\r\nand that, therefore, we want the opportunity to recruit the men from\r\nthe universities or colleges. Once they have served on the White House\r\ndetail for a period of 2 years, then they would get this permanent\r\nstatus. However, during the 2 years, they have an opportunity and they\r\nare encouraged to take the civil service examination, so they get\r\ncareer status. But there is no pressure from the Civil Service. It is a\r\nconvenience or agreement that they have arranged with us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Maybe I can help, Chief. Schedule A is an exemption from\r\nthe regular civil service roster, is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And the register is a list of employees from which you have\r\nto otherwise select Government employees if they are not exempt by\r\nreason of their positions, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, Civil Service Commission has set\r\nup for the White House detail all inclusive----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Not necessarily for the White House detail, Mr. Ford. For\r\nthe Secret Service--to allow us to get the type of individuals that we\r\nwant for both criminal investigation and protective work. Because if\r\nyou say exclusively for the White House detail, the fellow might not be\r\nequipped for the White House detail.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, every person recruited by Secret\r\nService for any capacity is recruited in the first instance under\r\nschedule A.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; if he hasn't--if he is not on the register for\r\ncivil service. We first go to the Civil Service, when we want to\r\nselect somebody, to see if there is anyone on there that meets our\r\nqualifications. And then, if not, then we hire them under schedule A,\r\nwhich is sort of a blanket exemption.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But I gather from what you have said, or I think\r\nyou are intimating that most of your recruiting actually is from\r\ncolleges, and they are under schedule A.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right; yes, sir. Most of them from your State,\r\nsir--Michigan State University.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is a fine school.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is where it started, actually. They were the first\r\nones. Now we also recruit on the west coast, in California, they have\r\nterrific schools out there.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I don't think you covered the Bolden matter\r\nas to whether you had an investigation made. Did you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; I did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you find out anything about the conduct of your agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I found out there was no truth to the charges of\r\nmisconduct. There were 11 charges lodged against us.\r\n\r\nOne charge, the ninth charge, a part of it was true. The boys did\r\ncontribute for food. In other words, up there in Hyannis, when they are\r\nup there for a week, or a weekend, they would be assigned to a house,\r\nwhich economically was beneficial to them. One shift, and some of the\r\ndrivers would be in this house. This house was in a remote area from\r\nthe shopping area and so forth. So they agreed when they arrived there\r\nto contribute, to buy food for breakfast, it being an 8 to 4 shift.\r\nEight to four meant they would have breakfast there and dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you mean by that, Chief? Did they get a certain\r\nhouse and were able to live together there to reduce their expenses?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And then they each contributed to that common expense?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did someone cook for them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. One of the agents who enjoyed it as a hobby cooked the\r\nmeals for them, while the others took care of the dishes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. They did contribute to supporting that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They contributed to supporting that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was there criticism of that action?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. There was criticism of the action to this extent: That when\r\nthey went shopping they bought two or three cases of beer which they\r\nhad available in the icebox when the men came off duty in the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, were they on a travel status or subject to----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Not on travel status under our regulations. They could\r\nbe there a week, and they would be working their 8 hours. They were\r\nnot working any longer than their 8 hours. It was comparable to their\r\nassignment here in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So it was really a summer White House position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Summer White House is what we called it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did you investigate the charges to see whether they\r\nwere valid?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I investigated. This portion was correct. There was some\r\nsubstance to that portion.\r\n\r\nHe also said he was left on post for a period of 2 hours and wasn't\r\nrelieved. That an agent had used this time to take care of his private\r\ncar. We established there was no agent up there who had a private car.\r\n\r\nFurther, we established that he was left on post because according\r\nto our arrangements it was routine that whenever the President went\r\nout for a cruise, the agents on the outer perimeter at the time would\r\nremain on duty, and the agents in the inner perimeter would accompany\r\nthe President on the cruise in the followup boat. Naturally, when they\r\nwere out on the boat, there was no one available to start what we\r\ncall the push, to rotate the men from one post to another. In other\r\nwords, in the White House or any place where we establish posts, every\r\nhalf hour one man starts from the office and starts making the push.\r\nThe first man is relieved and he relieves the next one, so there is\r\nno monotony on their jobs. They each have a different area. They are\r\nconversant or acquainted with each and every phase of the physical\r\narea. But because he was on one post, and not relieved, he complained.\r\n\r\nSo the next day, to bend over backwards, and show there was not any\r\nprejudice, the agent in charge took him on the cruise, so he would not\r\nfeel he was being ignored.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, from your investigation, did you find any violation at\r\nHyannis of the regulations of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you been informed of any other claims that Secret\r\nService agents had been violating the regulations while on duty?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; I haven't been informed of any others. And it\r\nseems in the last few days or few weeks we have been getting complaints\r\nthat we haven't had in many years. And I think, as I mentioned earlier,\r\nbecause of the fact that we are very careful with the type of men we\r\nscreen, their record has been above reproach over the years. They have\r\nconducted themselves in an exemplary manner. My files are replete with\r\ncommendations on behalf of the agents wherever they have traveled and\r\nworked with committees and individuals in connection with Presidential\r\ntravels, both here and abroad, which testifies to the impression that\r\nthey have made.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you ever had a Secret Service agent indicted or a\r\ncomplaint filed against him, a criminal complaint, prior to this time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. This is the first time I remember anything like this\r\nhappening since I have been with the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Rankin, I don't recall Chief Rowley saying\r\nprecisely what the reprimands were specifically for these violations of\r\nthe regulations in this one instance.\r\n\r\nYou spoke highly of their background, and you spoke very high in their\r\npraise. But I did not hear what reprimand, if any, had actually been\r\nlodged against them.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. There was no reprimand. You are talking about the current\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am talking about the Dallas trip.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I stated in considering what would be an appropriate\r\npunishment at the time, I felt that these men, by their conduct, had\r\nno bearing on the assassination of the President in Dallas. That to\r\ninstitute formal punishment or disciplinary action would inevitably\r\nlead the public to conclude that they were responsible for the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy. I did not think in the light of\r\nhistory that they should be stigmatized with something like that, or\r\ntheir families or children. And, for that reason, I took the position\r\nthat I did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So there was no official reprimand or disciplinary\r\naction?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you talk to the agents, to indicate and make it plain\r\nto them that this was a violation of the regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I talked to some of the agents, as did my inspector at the\r\ntime, who interviewed each and every one of them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And I think the Commission would be interested in whether\r\nyou can be assured, or assure them that the action you took was\r\nsufficient so that this would not happen again.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I am confident that it would not happen again, Mr.\r\nRankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us why you think so?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Because they realize the seriousness of their action.\r\n\r\nInitially I can understand the situation--they thought they were going\r\nfor a dinner, buffet, and they got into the place and it wasn't there.\r\n\r\nI talked personally with the agents there, and they just thought while\r\nthey were there they would have a drink. It was one of those situations.\r\n\r\nThe important thing was that it was pointed out to them this was wrong,\r\nthis was a violation. These men are young men with futures, they\r\nrealize the true situation, innocent as they may have seemed to think\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nBut I am quite confident that we will not have a repetition of that.\r\n\r\nAnd in talking to Mr. Behn--I am confident, too, in him--I know that he\r\nwill see to it that they are well supervised.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When they are out on a trip of this kind, Chief Rowley,\r\nas I understand your regulations, it is understood by the regulations\r\nand by the Secret Service that they are on duty all the time--that is,\r\nsubject to call?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And even though it is late in the evening or they had gone\r\nto bed in the early hours of the morning, they could be called to go on\r\nduty and perform their responsibility of taking care of the President\r\nor the Vice President, or whoever they are charged with; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. So that do they understand that when they are out on that\r\nkind of duty, they are subject to call at all times, and anything they\r\ndo contrary to regulations is a violation, because they are subject to\r\nthe call and must be ready at any moment to perform their duties.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They certainly do, because there have been situations,\r\nwhether or not they have had it with the Kennedy administration I don't\r\nknow--but I know there have been situations where we have moved fast,\r\nall hours of the night. I remember one instance, that has never been\r\ndisclosed--as Mr. Dulles knows, you never advertise your successes, you\r\njust get the other things--that I would like to give you as an example\r\noff the record, to answer your question, if I may.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nChief, it seems to me that on an assignment of that kind, to be alert\r\nat all times is one of the necessities of the situation. And I just\r\nwonder if you believe that men who did what these men did, being out\r\nuntil early morning hours, doing a little--even a small amount of\r\ndrinking--would be as alert the next day as men should be when they are\r\ncharged with the tremendous responsibility of protecting the President.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we checked on that, Mr. Chief Justice, and the agent\r\nin charge reported that they were in good physical condition. I don't\r\ncondone these late hours; no. This is not a rule. This case is an\r\nexception. However, because of the activities of any travel such as the\r\nPresidents today make from one place to another, to maybe seven States\r\nin a weekend, there is constant going.\r\n\r\nI don't condone this at all. But these men are young. They are of such\r\nage that I think that they responded in this instance adequately and\r\nsufficiently as anyone could under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I am thinking of this. As you go along in the\r\nmotorcade, you have men who are scanning the buildings along the way,\r\ndon't you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And they have submachineguns in one of the cars.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; for security reasons, I would like to--we don't have\r\nmachine-guns now, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I just thought I heard that from the record here, that\r\nthey had some kind of guns.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They had a weapon, a new weapon; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN. Well, whatever it is.\r\n\r\nNow, other people, as they went along there, even some people in the\r\ncrowds, saw a man with a rifle up in this building from which the\r\nPresident was shot. Now, don't you think that if a man went to bed\r\nreasonably early, and hadn't been drinking the night before, would be\r\nmore alert to see those things as a Secret Service agent, than if they\r\nstayed up until 3, 4, or 5 o'clock in the morning, going to beatnik\r\njoints and doing some drinking along the way?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. If I remember that witness' testimony--and that was one of\r\nthe first statements that he made--that witness was with his wife, and\r\nhe happened to look up there, and I think he said, \"There is a man with\r\na rifle, it is a Secret Service man,\" and let it go at that. He didn't\r\ninform any of the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. No; nobody did. But I say wouldn't an alert Secret\r\nService man in this motorcade, who is supposed to observe such things,\r\nbe more likely to observe something of that kind if he was free from\r\nany of the results of liquor or lack of sleep than he would otherwise?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, yes; he would be. But then, on the other hand, Mr.\r\nChief Justice, in some instances the men come in from a trip at 1:30 in\r\nthe morning, which there have been cases on travels that I have made,\r\nand have to be up at 3:30 or 4 o'clock, and out in time for a 5 o'clock\r\ndeparture. Then you go all that day until 1 or 2 o'clock the next\r\nmorning. This is what has happened in the past.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I am not talking about the past. We are talking about\r\nnine men here who were out until rather unusual hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They were to be on duty the next day.\r\n\r\nThe next day--or if not sooner.\r\n\r\nThe next day they were supposed to be alert to anything that might\r\noccur along the line of march. Don't you think that they would have\r\nbeen much more alert, sharper, had they not been doing these things?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; but I don't believe they could have prevented the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Isn't it a substantial violation of these rules to do a\r\nthing of that kind?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir--on the basis of this section here.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nNow, Chief I noticed, also, in reading some of the reports that three\r\nof these men whom you speak of, were actually on night duty, protecting\r\nthe life of the President. And around 4 o'clock in the morning, when\r\nthey were protecting him at the Texas Hotel, they said that they had a\r\ncoffee break, and they went from the hotel over to the beatnik joint.\r\nNow, is that consistent with your regulations?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. In this case, I talked to these three agents. They were\r\nrelieved at different times--because their posts are in the corridor of\r\na stuffy hotel----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Of the what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The corridor that they were on post outside the President's\r\nsuite was a stuffy one, and they went downstairs to get a breath of\r\nfresh air. And they walked--it was a block--and out of curiosity they\r\nwent into this place. One fellow looked in and left, he didn't buy\r\nany coffee. Another fellow went in and felt, I suppose, when he went\r\nin that he would buy a cup of coffee. But they were on what we call\r\nreliefs, the same as we relieve them around the White House. There are\r\nonly so many posts, but you have a group of men in one of the rooms\r\nof the hotel where they are available, like an alert squad, and they\r\nrelieve everyone on post every half hour. It is a part of the rotation\r\nof positions we have.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have any regulations concerning where they shall\r\nremain when they are relieved for this short period of time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They can go any place they want?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; not any place. They usually stay within the immediate\r\nconfines. That is understood. The hotel or the residence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, they didn't do that here, did they?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They went to the beatnik joint.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Now, is that consistent with their duty?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; it is not consistent or inconsistent with their duty.\r\nBut as they explained to me, they wanted to get a breath of fresh air.\r\nIf they are at a residence in a remote place, and they want to walk\r\naround the area, they might walk maybe a city block or so, which is\r\nwhat they do on a lot of these assignments--particularly in hotels.\r\nThis was not an air-conditioned hotel.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It would seem to me that a beatnik joint is a place\r\nwhere queer people of all kinds gather anyway, and that the mere fact\r\nthat these men did leave their post of duty might be an indication to\r\nsomeone that the President was not being protected, and might leave an\r\nopening for them to go there and try to do something.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They were relieved, Mr. Chief Justice. They didn't leave\r\ntheir post of duty. They would not leave their post of duty until they\r\nwere relieved by someone.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. As I understood the report, they said they left for a\r\ncoffee break.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, it is an expression. They left to have coffee, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Was there any place for coffee in the hotel?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think there was a coffee shop in the hotel; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That was the only place in town, as I understood, from\r\nthe reports, outside of the beatnik place they could. But they went\r\ndown to the beatnik place. Did they do that by prearrangement with the\r\nother agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; it was curiosity on their part. They hadn't seen\r\nthe other agents. There was no arrangement of any nature at all, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But they did there meet other agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They saw other agents--those that were in the place at the\r\ntime they looked in. I think they came in after most had left, though.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were these men off duty for the night or were they going\r\nback on duty immediately after this break?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; they were on duty. They were the midnight shift, Mr.\r\nDulles, from 12 to 8 a.m.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They were going back on duty?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They were going back on duty; yes, sir; in 10 minutes, 15\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And they did go back on duty and relieve somebody\r\nsubsequent to this?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you give the Commission a letter as of\r\nMay 5 of this year in regard to this Dallas matter concerning the Press\r\nClub and the Cellar?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And is that letter correct in regard to what happened as\r\nfar as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did you make available to the Commission the statements\r\nof each agent signed by the agent?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think you said Dallas. Did you not mean Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes--it should be Fort Worth, I am sorry. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1019 and ask you if that is your\r\nletter of May 5 that we have just referred to.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1019 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1019.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1019, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Chief, I notice in the report that was made that while\r\nyour inspector found that no one--no member of the Secret Service was\r\nintoxicated at the club--but that there was someone connected with the\r\ngroup who was intoxicated.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I wonder if that also wasn't a violation of that portion\r\nof the rule which says, \"In interpreting the words 'excessive' and\r\n'improper' slight evidence tending to indicate unusual or questionable\r\nconduct will be considered proof that the use of liquor has been\r\nimproper or excessive. Association with others who drink to excess will\r\nbe considered as an indication of using more than a moderate amount of\r\nliquor.\"\r\n\r\nDid you call that to the attention of your people?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir. They ran into that individual as they were\r\nentering--two agents ran into this individual as they were entering the\r\nFort Worth Club.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1020, and\r\nask you if that is a document that you had prepared for the Commission.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1020 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that includes, under capital letter A, the transmittal\r\nfrom Inspector McCann; B, the report of the investigation by Inspector\r\nMcCann; C, the Drew Pearson article?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. D, the statements of the supervisors; and, E, the\r\nstatements of the special agents; F, the statements of witnesses; and,\r\nG, the memorandum of May 19, 1964, by Agent Sorrels, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And are those various documents a part of the official\r\nreport by the Secret Service to the Commission of this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1020.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1020, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Off the record, may I ask a question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nChief, I notice--I have read this report. At any place in here, did any\r\nof your investigators, Inspector McCann, or your special agents, or\r\nanybody else, indicate that there had been any violation of any kind on\r\nthe part of your people, or particularly any violation of this section\r\n10, chapter 1, page 7 of the Secret Service manual?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think what happened in this instance, we responded\r\nto the broadcast of Mr. Pearson and his charge that the men were\r\ninebriated. We were primarily concerned with that at that time. And to\r\nget the statements from the men. But I do know that in the course of\r\nhis interviewing of these individuals at the time, and taking their\r\nstatements, he impressed upon them the fact that there was a violation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Has there been any report made to the Commission to the\r\neffect that there was any violation of----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; unless it is contained in this document here, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I have not seen anything in there. It seems to me they\r\nwere all given a complete bill of health. And I just wonder if that is\r\nquite consistent with the facts that the Commission should have.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; as I said earlier, we don't condone their actions,\r\nnor do we try to belittle the violation. But in the circumstances, I\r\ntook the decision that I thought right in view of the tragedy and so\r\nforth. In any other circumstance it would have been entirely different.\r\nBut as I said earlier, I don't think that these people should be blamed\r\nfor the tragedy that happened at that time, and that any attempt to\r\nassess formal punishment would in the light of history stigmatize them\r\nfor the rest of their life, as well as their families.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I plan to leave that subject now--unless\r\nthere is some further question.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Any further questions?\r\n\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, will you tell us whether you learned anything\r\nabout the preparations in Dallas for the visit of the President on\r\nNovember 22?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; I read the report of Special Agent Lawson, who was\r\ndesignated as the advance agent for that visit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And do you know that that report has been furnished to us?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. A copy of it.\r\n\r\nAnd have you examined it to determine whether it is accurate, as far as\r\nyou can determine?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It is accurate; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any additions or corrections?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; I have no corrections to make, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Were you--are you satisfied, now examining that report,\r\nwith the manner in which the advance preparations for the trip of the\r\nPresident were handled?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe report follows the standard procedure that we have exercised\r\nover the years, and in many of the trips we had taken with the late\r\nPresident. He covered everything with the police and all that we have\r\nnormally covered on such visits.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you have enough agents at that time to perform the\r\nrequired duties in connection with this trip for both Dallas and the\r\nother cities in Texas to be visited?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we never have enough agents for the activities that\r\nthe President today is engaged in. We draw from the field to supplement\r\nor augment the agents from the White House detail. We move the agents\r\nfrom one point to another where we can--particularly in the area of the\r\nadvance men.\r\n\r\nBut in Dallas we had sufficient agents with prior experience in\r\nPresidential protection who assisted Mr. Lawson in the advance\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you furnish to the Commission a statement of the\r\npreparations that were made for the trip?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that included the various protective activities, did it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1021, and ask you if that\r\nis the report you made in regard to the trip.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1021 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any corrections or additions that you care to\r\nmake to it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1021.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1021, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Chief, I have wondered about this question. Some months\r\nbefore Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been handled very roughly in\r\nDallas. Did you make--did your people make any investigation as to that\r\ngroup that caused that disturbance for him, to see if there might be\r\nsome possibility of the same thing happening to the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Not immediately at the time of the incident that occurred\r\nto Mr. Stevenson, but when the advance man came down, that was one of\r\nthe things that we assigned a local agent to inquire into, to ascertain\r\nthe hard core of that group, if you will, that were responsible for\r\nstimulating that activity. And he contacted an informant, and with the\r\nlocal police, who are members of a special squad that are involved in\r\nthis kind of activity, they went and identified through pictures, which\r\nthey saw in the newsreel, the principal members. They had photographs\r\nmade, and they issued them to the agents on their visit there, to be on\r\nthe lookout for these men as potential troublemakers.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did they do the same thing concerning the incident that\r\nVice President Johnson had a year or so before that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; not at that time. That was more or less in the\r\nheat of a political campaign. I don't think that was a similar type of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nBut you did do it with the Stevenson matter?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you make a report to the Commission with\r\nregard to the publicity concerning the trip of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And is Commission Exhibit No. 1022 that report?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1022 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you wish to make any additions or corrections of that\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Of that letter? No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1022.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1022, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, could you inform the Commission about the\r\nadvance publicity concerning trips of the President to various parts of\r\nthe country? There has been the question raised as to whether that is a\r\nthreat to the President, and might make the work of the Secret Service\r\nand others who are doing protective work more difficult.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we have found that it is. And we always consider it\r\nas a potential threat in that it might give someone the opportunity\r\nwho had any plans, whether it be an individual as in this case, or a\r\ngroup, to select an area, if they knew what the route was, or conduct\r\na reconnaissance, if you will. I have always been opposed to it, and I\r\nhave always tried to prevail upon the staff of the various Presidents\r\nwho might be responsible for the release, not to release it too far in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you tell the Commission what the problem is in that\r\nregard?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, in this regard, it is a political thing, and the\r\nPresident cannot be contained in a vacuum. If he wants to go out and\r\nmeet the people under our form of government, he will in his own\r\nway. Each and every President has his own thoughts and methods as it\r\npertains to these visits, and the need for publicity. This trip in\r\nDallas was an opportunity for the people to see the President, as are\r\nthe trips of any President. I remember well when President Truman\r\nstarted his trip across the country in June 1948, the purpose being to\r\nget the feel of the people and let the people see him at the time.\r\n\r\nAnd it was then, as a result of that trip, that he determined he would\r\nrun for reelection. That I know of my own personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut these are the things that are hard in security, as far as\r\ndeveloping a close screen on the President.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service\r\nunder your direction, too?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; that is part of the White House area, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you familiar with the testimony of Robert Bouck\r\nconcerning that Section?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether that accurately describes the conduct\r\nof that Section?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, at that time. The Section was established by us\r\nsome 20 years ago, and primarily to process threats, obscene letters\r\nand suicide notes. Over the years, and particularly during the last 9\r\nyears, the work has evolved to a point where we find that it requires\r\nfurther expansion.\r\n\r\nIt had a broad and general concept in the criteria of what it needed\r\nfor Presidential protection in knowing what risks were about the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did the Secret Service have a written communication to\r\nother intelligence agencies as to the criteria for information that\r\nthey sought?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; it was more or less of an informal arrangement that we\r\nhad with the agencies, as we developed the Section.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell the Commission what the standard was that you\r\ntold the agencies you would like to have information concerning?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, if there were any threats to the President, we were\r\ninterested in being informed about it. We were in touch with the FBI,\r\nthe CIA and others.\r\n\r\nIn the basic schools of the Treasury, and through coordination, our\r\nagents in charge of the areas, in coordination meetings, would inform\r\nrepresentatives of other agencies of the type that we were interested\r\nin, the nature of the threats that we asked that they refer to us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know that this standard only developed about 400\r\nnames from all over the country?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that it produced none in the immediate Dallas vicinity?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, have you done anything about that standard since the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we have had a complete reexamination of the\r\nProtective Research Section.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you describe----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We infused new blood. We have asked the Rand Corp.,\r\nthe Research Analysis Corp., the President's Scientific Advisor,\r\nand the medical people for a study of this, and we are in constant\r\nconsultation. We have brought in experienced agents who now are\r\nprocessing, evaluating, and analyzing all reports we receive, and\r\nindexing the information as we receive it from the various agencies. We\r\nhave more recently issued and forwarded to the intelligence community\r\nin Washington our criteria at the present time regarding what we would\r\nask them in a more formal manner. This is the beginning of what we hope\r\nto be a more thorough and practical approach to this problem.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief, I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1023, dated\r\nJune 17, 1964, and ask you if that is a communication from you to the\r\nCommission describing the new criteria.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1023 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Does it accurately state that criteria?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1023.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1023, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. If I may read----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell us the gist of the new criteria, and what\r\nthe difference is as you conceive it from the old standard?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, if I may do this. We have sent this criteria to the\r\nintelligence agencies that we think would be of help to us, with a\r\ncovering letter in which we say that studies are now underway, \"by\r\nwhich we hope to develop more detailed criteria. Our experience with\r\nthe attached guidelines will also be carefully evaluated with a view\r\ntowards amendments if required. We will appreciate your cooperation\r\nand suggestions concerning these guidelines, so that the person of the\r\nPresident will be protected to the best of our combined abilities and\r\nresources.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing today now that we have to concern ourselves with, is that\r\nwe get an expanding file of information.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Has that happened since the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well yes; we have gotten some 9,000 reports on the members\r\nof the Communist Party from the FBI. At this time we have read and\r\nevaluated and catalogued them and indexed them. There has been a small\r\npercentage that have been to date of interest to us. But this is the\r\nbeginning. And except for the indexes, we are more or less current as a\r\nresult of that. This is through the long hours and hard work by the new\r\ngroup that I brought in to develop this department.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, how is the standard described in Exhibit No. 1023\r\ndifferent from the prior standard?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we have always had the basic standard. The other\r\nstandard was the threat to harm or embarrass the President, however,\r\nthis time we added three factors.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And these are in addition to the threat of harm to the\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All right, proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The interest of the individual or the organization,\r\ncapabilities of the individual or the organization, and the activities\r\nof the individual or organization. The interests of the individual or\r\norganization is the prime factor to be considered in the criteria, but\r\nmust be coupled with the capability and activity of the individual or\r\norganization in any determination for referral to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\n\"The interest must be towards the President, or others named, or other\r\nhigh Government official in the nature of a complaint, coupled with an\r\nexpressed or implied determination to use a means other than legal or\r\npeaceful to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined. After the interest\r\nphase of the criteria is met, then the activity which encompass\r\nprevious history, that is, mental instability, history of violence and\r\nthe capability of the individual or organization for furthering this\r\ninterest will dictate whether the case should be referred to the Secret\r\nService. In making referrals to the Secret Service, it is requested\r\nthat the agency furnish all pertinent background information relating\r\nto each of the three factor criteria.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, is the Secret Service operating under the standard or\r\ncriteria described in Exhibit No. 1023 at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. At the present time, it is, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And when did that become effective?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That became effective in the last 3 weeks as we developed\r\nand explored and examined the many reports that we were receiving.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, the language that you read into the record, where you\r\ninvited comment and suggestions from the various other agencies to whom\r\nyou sent communication, what did you mean by that? Is that asking them\r\nfor their ideas so that you may further change the criteria?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Where we may get in a position later on to break it down\r\ninto categories. In other words, if every agency forwards and inundates\r\nus with many reports--say we expand to 3 million, obviously, the whole\r\nintelligence family could not cope with that. You have to get it down\r\nto a workable number. On the other hand, if you try to restrict the\r\ncategories too much, then you find yourself in a position that you may\r\nmiss another Oswald, and then the utilities of your file are of no\r\nconsequence. So you have to try to reach the level in between there\r\nwhere it is going to be practical for us to react or develop the type\r\nof risks that we think should be covered by our organization in the\r\nprotection of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you doing anything about the use of equipment that\r\nmight help you to secure information about any particular locality the\r\nPresident was going to travel to more readily?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. In connection with the PRS?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, we have conferred with the IBM. Can I go off the\r\nrecord on this?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, you have described off the record certain\r\nmatters that involve the security of the country and cannot be made\r\npublic. But can you tell us whether you have done anything in the past\r\nto try to improve your methods in testimony that can be made public?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I have tried to secure in the appropriations funds to\r\nenable us to procure the equipment and personnel that we thought would\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nWith the approval of the Congress, we were able 2 years ago to secure\r\nfunds to enable us, in our check forgeries program, to try to adapt the\r\ncharacteristics of handwriting to an ADP processing program. We are\r\nhopeful this will work out. And we have used the Bureau of Standards to\r\nassist us in this program. We have prints out and have programmed part\r\nof the operation.\r\n\r\nNow, it was my thought that if we succeeded in that area, we could also\r\napply it to PRS. So we are working quite hard on this other area. And I\r\nknew the need would be eventually for us to get into the PRS stage on\r\nthe electronic machine situation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, did you know that we had asked Mr. Bouck when he\r\ntestified if he could inform us at a later date about people who were\r\nin institutions or otherwise might be dangerous, and with regard to\r\nwhom you asked that the Secret Service be notified, so that they could\r\nmake adequate protection for the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know how many such cases you now have?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Approximately a thousand.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell the Commission what your practice was for\r\nthe Secret Service concerning the route of the motorcade at the time\r\nof the assassination--that is, whether you made inspection of adjacent\r\nbuildings?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. At that time, and prior to that time, except for the\r\ninaugurations in Washington, and other parades, involving the visit of\r\nforeign dignitaries in Washington, in which the President would ride\r\nin the motorcade with the head of state, where we had ample time to\r\nmake these surveys, we had never conducted on trips out of Washington\r\nsurveys of this nature. I have here a statement of the conditions that\r\nprevailed in Dallas as well as other areas--if I may read this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. \"Except for inauguration or other parades involving\r\nforeign dignitaries accompanied by the President in Washington, it\r\nhas not been the practice of the Secret Service to make surveys or\r\nchecks of buildings along the route of a Presidential motorcade. For\r\nthe inauguration and certain other parades in Washington where the\r\ntraditional route is known to the public long in advance of the event,\r\nbuildings along the route can be checked by teams of law enforcement\r\nofficers, and armed guards are posted along the route as appropriate.\r\nBut on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public\r\nonly a few days in advance, buildings are not checked either by Secret\r\nService agents or by any other law enforcement officers at the request\r\nof the Secret Service. With the number of men available to the Secret\r\nService and the time available, surveys of hundreds of buildings and\r\nthousands of windows is not practical.\r\n\r\n\"In Dallas the route selected necessarily involved passing through\r\nthe principal downtown section between tall buildings. While certain\r\nstreets thought to be too narrow could be avoided and other choices\r\nmade, it was not practical to select a route where the President could\r\nnot be seen from roofs or windows of buildings. At the two places in\r\nDallas where the President would remain for a period of time, Love\r\nField and the Trade Mart, arrangements were made for building and\r\nroof security by posting police officers where appropriate. Similar\r\narrangements for a motorcade of 10 miles, including many blocks of\r\ntall commercial buildings, is not practical. Nor is it practical to\r\nprevent people from entering such buildings or to limit access in every\r\nbuilding to those employed or having business there. Even if it were\r\npossible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many\r\nobservers have felt that such a procedure would not be consistent with\r\nthe nature and purpose of the motorcade to let the people see their\r\nPresident and to welcome him to their city.\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with its regular procedures, no survey or other check\r\nwas made by the Secret Service, or by any other law enforcement agency\r\nat its request, of the Texas School Book Depository Building or those\r\nemployed there prior to the time the President was shot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I will ask you not to describe any procedure,\r\nbecause of security considerations, but I would like to have you tell\r\non the record, as I think it is proper, whether there has been a change\r\nin this regard in the procedures of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. There has been a change in this regard.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will not make an inquiry about that, unless the\r\nCommission wishes to go into it off the record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is it my understanding that the Commission has\r\nsuch documents that we could analyze ourselves as to these changes?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I don't think we have any report of this.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Why can't we get it off the record?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you give us----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question with regard to Exhibit No. 1023?\r\n\r\nThis, as I understand it, is the new specifications with regard to\r\npersons with respect to whom you wish to have alert information.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is called, \"U.S. Secret Service Protective Information\r\nGuidelines.\" The top of page 2 of this exhibit is a paragraph that\r\nreads, \"The interest\"--and that is the interest of the suspect, I\r\nassume----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. \"The interest must be towards the President, or others\r\nnamed, or other high Government officials in the nature of a complaint\r\ncoupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means other\r\nthan legal or peaceful to satisfy any grievance real or imagined.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder if you could explain that a little more? I ask this question\r\nbecause I have been studying the previous assassinations a good\r\ndeal. And in many of these cases, it seems to me this definition\r\nwould not have covered the assassin. That is, there has been in some\r\ncases opposition to government, opposition to people in authority,\r\nbut there has been no expressed hatred toward or animus against a\r\nparticular President. And I was wondering whether this went too far on\r\na definition to meet your purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. This is a beginning, as I indicated to you here. We hope to\r\nimprove it. But this is one of the things where we want to include the\r\nOswald-type individual.\r\n\r\nNow, Oswald wrote to the Governor intimating that he would use whatever\r\nmeans was necessary to obtain the change of his undesirable, or as he\r\ncalled it, dishonorable discharge. All legal means had been used in\r\nhis case, where the Navy Review Board had examined it and came to a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAnd this is an example of what we were trying to include in the area of\r\nthis type of individual. Now, the other people----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But that was not a threat directed against the President.\r\nThat was directed against the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right; but then, on the other hand, they transfer\r\nthe threats. I am quite sure that the Congressmen here get many\r\nthreats, and that sometimes they may not come off. But these people are\r\nobsessed.\r\n\r\nYou take the individual that attempted the assassination of the late\r\nPresident Roosevelt in Miami that time. His original purpose was to\r\nshoot President Hoover. But then when he heard Roosevelt was there, he\r\ntransferred.\r\n\r\nNow, I remember a situation involving a member of Truman's staff, where\r\na fellow stalked this man at his home. And finally we got into the case\r\non his request. We satisfied ourselves that he wasn't a real threat to\r\nhim--but we picked up the paper a year later and found out he shot at\r\nan assemblyman in Staten Island. So if they make a threat or something\r\nlike this, even though it is against the Government as a group, or have\r\nsome grievance, they transfer it--particularly, to the President. They\r\nuse that father complex, as indicated in the research work that these\r\ndifferent agencies have submitted to us.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Under these criteria, which you are now following,\r\nOswald would have been designated? Is that your judgment?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I had some questions about that in reading it. That did\r\nnot occur to me, because Oswald had never expressed any antagonism\r\ntoward the President, as far as I know, up to this time--the President\r\npersonally, or even afterward.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right; but under this criteria he would. Namely, he\r\nhad the interest because of the letter he wrote to Governor Connally.\r\nThe activity, because he was a defector, and he demonstrated for the\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee. The capability, because he traveled, and\r\nhe had knowledge of firearms.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; but those do not come, it seems to me, within this\r\ndefinition. Maybe I interpret it differently than you. The last\r\ninterest Oswald showed was directed toward General Walker. It wasn't\r\nagainst--of course, that wasn't known.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; it wasn't known but the first interest of this type was\r\nthe letter to Governor Connally as Secretary of the Navy, in which he\r\nsaid he would use whatever means he could to correct that discharge,\r\ninferring, of course, that he would apply illegal means if he could.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If we only had the letter that he wrote to\r\nGovernor Connally, and no other information, how would that threat, or\r\nthat course of action, become known to the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It would not, unless it was furnished by the Navy\r\nDepartment or Secretary of the Navy's office.\r\n\r\nJust like you gentlemen get letters that never come to our attention.\r\nBut you might pick up a paper some day and read that this fellow hit\r\nsomebody, and he was in to see you or wrote you letters.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would this criteria be circulated among the\r\n50 Governors, for example, or their staffs, so that if threats are\r\nreceived against a Governor, then the Governor's staff in that\r\nparticular State would so notify the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It could. In this case it would be a help. But they refer\r\nall their complaints to the FBI. Threats of this kind.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The State?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The Governors do in most cases. So that the FBI under this\r\nsystem would bring it to our attention.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would think, Mr. Rowley, this might be subject to\r\nmisinterpretation as being rather narrower than you suggest.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, this is something--actually, we have to develop\r\nsomething, and we have to, if you will, have a crash program; we are\r\nworking constantly to develop the categories and breakdowns as I\r\nindicated earlier.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you supply to us the statements of the\r\nSecret Service agents who were informed about the assassination in\r\nDallas? You gave us written statements, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1024, and ask you if that\r\nis the letter of transmittal, together with the attached statements\r\nthat you have just described from the various agents about the events\r\nat Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1024 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1024.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1024, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would like to inform the Commission that these are copies\r\nof the statements you already have in connection with the Secret\r\nService report, but we wanted to make it part of the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief, did you write me a letter for the Commission on\r\nApril 22, in which you enclosed the statements of five of your agents\r\nin regard to President Kennedy's views about agents riding on the back\r\nof the car?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1025, and ask you if\r\nthat is your transmittal letter with the statements attached.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1025 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1025.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1025, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I should like to have you state for the\r\nrecord, for the Commission, whether the action of President Kennedy in\r\nmaking these statements was understood by you or properly could have\r\nbeen understood by the agents as relieving them of any responsibility\r\nabout the protection of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; I would not so construe that, Mr. Rankin. The agents\r\nwould respond regardless of what the President said if the situation\r\nindicated a potential danger. The facilities were available to them.\r\nThey had the rear steps, they would be there as a part of the screen.\r\nAnd immediately in the event of any emergency they would have used them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know why there was no one riding on the rear step at\r\nthe time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. From normal practice, based on my own experience over the\r\nyears, I know that the agent in charge in the front or any experienced\r\nagent, who is either on the right front or the left front of the\r\nfollowup car, without being told, will react immediately. If he\r\ndetermines there is a situation here, there is a big crowd, and so\r\nforth, he will immediately leave that followup car.\r\n\r\nNow, the running board on the followup car has an important place in\r\nthe setup. It is a much better place to be than on the rear step if you\r\nsee a situation, and you want to move fast. Suppose someone is coming\r\ntoward the President's car--you would be surprised how fast you are\r\npropelled by jumping off that car, and you are in motion fast, where\r\nyou can either tackle somebody, or block him or anything like that. So\r\nthis is an important part. You cannot do that from the rear step of the\r\nPresident's car.\r\n\r\nNow, when the agents are in a heavy crowd, as we have been abroad, in\r\nplaces where we had to run, say, for 10 miles alongside the car, agents\r\ncould stand on the rear steps and screen the President. In addition,\r\nthere would be agents on the side, protecting him on his right side.\r\nThe crowd is surging close to him, you are bouncing off the car, and\r\nthe people, trying to ward them off from touching the President.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of time you are weary. But with the aid of this step,\r\nyou can be replaced by the agent there, and he takes your place until\r\nyou revive yourself, and you are acting as a screen.\r\n\r\nNow, if the thing gets too sticky, you put the agent right in the back\r\nseat, which I have done many times with past Presidents.\r\n\r\nWhen you come out of a big crowd like that, and the crowd is sparse,\r\nand it doesn't look like there is a potential danger, you return to the\r\nfollowup car to be ready for any emergency in the event somebody darts\r\nacross.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, when the Presidential car was coming toward the\r\nfreeway and the people were sparse, the men at some point came back to\r\nthis car. This is one of the automatic operations, if you will, that\r\nthe agents respond to. So it wasn't until the first shot was fired\r\nthat, as I said earlier, Hill had the opportunity to scan from his left\r\nto his right, that he saw the President--the action of the President.\r\nThen he responded immediately. That is why he got up to the President's\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Has it ever been the practice of the Secret Service to have\r\nan agent ride all of the time on the back step?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; it hasn't. Because there are times when you pick up\r\nyour speed, for instance on a freeway. And when you pick up your speed,\r\nit is the most difficult thing on a step maybe 10 to 12 inches wide,\r\nand a grip, to stand up. And you would not be a very good screen going\r\nthat fast, because you would have to bend down. That has happened to\r\nme, because I have been caught on it.\r\n\r\nNow, I was in Costa Rica and worked the followup car. Whenever I was\r\non a trip abroad, I would work the followup car to see how the agents\r\nwork, and work myself, because it wasn't what you might refer to as a\r\nroutine trip.\r\n\r\nBut the followup car conked out. The crowds were surging around the\r\nPresident's car. We had two men next to the President's car. I left the\r\nfollowup car immediately, from my experience, and jumped on the step,\r\nto the right rear of the President, and held onto the handgrip, and\r\nwas there. And then when the man came back, I relieved him and took my\r\nposition on the side--until, for a distance of a mile or two, until\r\nsuch time as the followup car got underway, and the other people came\r\nup. But you had to stay with the President under those circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo those are the different things that occur in a given situation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Chief, as I understand this, President Kennedy did not\r\ngive any general instructions to the agents never to ride on his car.\r\nIt was only in specific circumstances where for one reason or another\r\nhe did not want them on there at that particular time.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No President will tell the Secret Service what they can or\r\ncannot do.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Sometimes it might be as a political man or individual he\r\nmight think this might not look good in a given situation. But that\r\ndoes not mean per se that he doesn't want you on there. And I don't\r\nthink anyone with commonsense interprets it as such.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think there are certain things that you have to allow the\r\nman who is operating as a politician, and not as head of state. I mean\r\nthis makes a difference in your operation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you give us a report of the activities in\r\nprotecting the President at and around Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And is that Commission Exhibit No. 1026?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1026 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1026.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1026, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any additions or corrections you care to make\r\nin that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you give us a report about protective\r\nactivity subsequent to Dallas on behalf of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1027 and ask you if\r\nthat is the report that you have just referred to.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1027 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I ask you, are there any problems with regard\r\nto Commission Exhibit No. 1027 concerning security, and whether that\r\nshould be--that document should be made public? You just take your time\r\nif you want to glance over it.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; as I read it, it is general enough, sir, that it can be\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1027.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1027, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are there any of the various answers that you give in the\r\nanswers to the questions attached to Commission Exhibit No. 1027 that\r\nyou care to elaborate on at this time?\r\n\r\nI am not asking you or urging you to do it, because I assume that you\r\nanswered them with care at the time. I just wanted to give you that\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; not at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask a question there?\r\n\r\nYou consider that the criteria as now furnished by you to the FBI and\r\nother investigative agencies would cover a case like Oswald's?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think they would?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think they understand that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, as we stated in the covering letter when we sent this\r\nout--we haven't gotten any reaction--we asked for their cooperation and\r\nsuggestions in connection with such guidelines.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Defectors are not specifically covered, are they, by your\r\ncriteria?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, they are given to us now. We are being furnished the\r\nnames of defectors, and they are being investigated, so that their\r\nbackground and history will be furnished to us, and we will be in a\r\nposition now to determine whether they represent a risk or not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. May I ask a question there?\r\n\r\nWould you have any notion as to why names of defectors were not\r\nprovided to you prior to November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; under the broad picture, Mr. Congressman, there was\r\nno indication that they had made any threat toward the President\r\nor members of his family. Whenever there was a threat made, we were\r\nfurnished promptly by the different agencies the information on the\r\nindividual's name. And this was done in voluminous reports by the FBI,\r\nand the other agencies. When they got any information, they would\r\nnotify the local office, notify their liaison, who notified us by\r\ntelephone, and confirmed by memorandum. The same obtained with respect\r\nto the CIA.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. This fellow was interviewed by the FBI several\r\ntimes--he was interviewed in New Orleans when he allegedly had his\r\nFair Play Committee. If my memory serves me correctly, Mrs. Paine was\r\ninterviewed about him shortly before the visit of the President, after\r\nhe had gone to work at the Texas School Book Depository. I agree that\r\nthere had been no indication of a threat on the President's life. But,\r\nobviously he was a person in the FBI files who was under some degree of\r\nsurveillance. It would seem to me strange that the FBI did not transmit\r\nthis information to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The FBI, Mr. Congressman, are concerned with internal\r\nsecurity. And I think their approach was internal security as it\r\nrelated to this individual, whether or not he was a potential recruit\r\nfor espionage, intelligence, or something like that.\r\n\r\nTheir concern was talking to him in this vein, in the course of which\r\nthere was no indication that he bore any malice toward anyone, and\r\nparticularly to the President of the United States. If someone said\r\nthat Henry Smith didn't like the President, and we got his file, we\r\nwould get to the point where you have 3 million names in the file. How\r\neffective are you going to be then?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. And then you get in the area of civil rights and all, if\r\nyou start going into individuals----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And if I remember correctly, there has never\r\nbeen--we have had no testimony from anyone that Oswald ever threatened\r\nthe President of the United States. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That was the only question I had.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Along that line, I just raise the question as to whether\r\nmaybe too much emphasis is not put on the threat angle, because a\r\nclever fellow, if he is going to assassinate the President, the last\r\nthing he is going to do is go around and talk about it and threaten it.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. Well, this has been so with loners, too.\r\n\r\nAs you say, you read the assassinations. Some of them just kept to\r\nthemselves, and traveled, and the next thing you know they confronted\r\ntheir victim. Sometimes they were successful, other times they were not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I recognize the difficulty of working out adequate\r\ncriteria. But I just think you ought to do some more seeking, and there\r\nis more work to be done on that.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask this question: It hasn't been clear to me.\r\nIs it correct that now a defector does come within the scope of your\r\nService?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; we are furnished the names of defectors by the\r\nFBI. And they investigate these people. And then in their report, if it\r\nshows that the individual has emotional instability or propensity for\r\nviolence, we pick it up from there. But all the reports on the known\r\ndefectors in this country are submitted to us, and then we evaluate\r\nfrom the case history of the report whether or not he would be a risk\r\nfor us subject to investigation.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I understood that was the procedure before. But my\r\nquestion is now, is the defector per se classed as one of those against\r\nwhom you would take protective measures?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, no, sir; not unless we had----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Since the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Not unless we had these three categories of factors we just\r\nenunciated.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I would suggest--first, I understand there are not many\r\ndefectors who have returned to the United States.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it seems to me a man who has defected from the United\r\nStates to go to Russia or a Communist country indicates that he has\r\npretty strong convictions against the United States, or else there is\r\nsomething questionable about his mental processes.\r\n\r\nI would think that fact alone would make it important to watch his\r\nactivities when he came back.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It would. And I think the FBI properly conducts the\r\ninvestigations, from the standpoint of internal security, and furnishes\r\nus a report. And then if there is something in the report that\r\nindicates he could be a risk to the President or the Vice President, we\r\ncould take it from there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Rankin. I have to go to a meeting in 2 or 3\r\nminutes. There is just one question I would like to ask before leaving.\r\n\r\nIs it not a fact that probably the greatest deterrent that you have is\r\nthe very fact that the public knows that there is a Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That you do guard the life of the President. And\r\nthat the chances of an assassin escaping with his own life are pretty\r\nremote. So this psychological weapon is one of the things you rely on?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And you must necessarily keep a degree of secrecy\r\nabout the methods you employ.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; otherwise they could develop countermethods, to\r\nthwart anything we might set up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Exactly. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, do you in the Secret Service obtain the\r\nbenefit of cooperation with other governmental agencies in the\r\nprotection of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We receive cooperation from every agency. If I may name a\r\nfew--we were scheduled to visit Puerto Rico in 1948 or 1947--I am not\r\nquite certain--with President Truman, who was then vacationing at Key\r\nWest. We had no office in Puerto Rico at the time. We did not know the\r\nsituation other than that it could be sticky because of the Nationalist\r\nParty of Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Our advance man called me and asked me if I would not\r\ntalk to Mr. Hoover to see whether or not we could have the assistance\r\nof some of their agents who were down there in an office established\r\nthere. And I communicated then with the Assistant Director, who said,\r\n\"I will get back to you\" and got the approval. That was an example of\r\nthe beginning of the cooperation, when I was at the White House, with\r\nthe FBI.\r\n\r\nNow, in the years subsequent to World War II, anytime we were abroad,\r\nI made personal contact with Mr. Dulles, and I think for national\r\nsecurity we should go off the record on this, because this is something\r\nthat pertains today.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, Chief Rowley, are you familiar with the provisions\r\nin the appropriation act with regard to the FBI concerning their\r\nprotection of the person of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know of that, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; I do. Historically, that was first passed in 1910. It\r\nstated that because of the limited number of Secret Service men at that\r\ntime, that appropriation--a certain given figure--was to be used by the\r\nU.S. marshals to assist the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was the Secret Service opposed to that provision in the\r\nappropriation act for the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; it has never opposed that provision over the years. I\r\nstarted to say, Mr. Rankin--subsequently, after the founding of the\r\nFBI, this was transferred, apparently, from the marshals to the FBI,\r\nand it has been in the appropriations as long as I can remember. We\r\nhave never objected to that appropriation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, there is some language in H.R. 4158, I understand,\r\nwhich deals with the permanent organization of the Government that you\r\nare objecting to; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; that has to do with the codification, wherein\r\nit states that the Attorney General will appoint--I think, in\r\nsubstance--officials for the protection of the President of the United\r\nStates. And this is a feature in the codification of the law we object\r\nto, because the Secretary of the Treasury authorizes and directs the\r\nprotection of the President.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that a bill, Mr. Rankin, that is before the\r\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate Judiciary Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. They are preparing it, and they asked for our opinions. It\r\nmust be now. This is a month or so ago, Mr. Ford.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think I can give the Commission the exact language. It\r\nis chapter 33 of the House rule that I have just described, and it is\r\nunder section 534, and the words are: \"The Attorney General may appoint\r\nofficials\"--and then in quotes below that, in (2) \"to protect the\r\nperson of the President\" and--and then it deals with other matters.\r\n\r\nNow, will you tell why you have an objection to that? Just briefly\r\nsummarize it.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Because of the long history of Presidential protection we\r\nhave been directed--it has been under the jurisdiction of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury. But this would\r\nconfuse and be a conflict in jurisdiction. Conflicts would naturally\r\narise in the future as to who had jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf anything happened like Dallas, we would get into an Alphonse and\r\nGaston pantomine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You would get into a jurisdictional dispute?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that is why you object?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But as far as any provision that has been made historically\r\nfor the FBI to have funds so they can supplement and assist you, you\r\nhave no objection to that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No objection at all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you know how much in the way of funds have been\r\nutilized through that provision?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; I would not know of my own knowledge, Congressman,\r\nbecause that would be under the jurisdiction of the FBI and the Budget\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, they don't take money that they\r\nget through their appropriation bill, and transfer it to the Secret\r\nService?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is simply a provision which authorizes them\r\nto use whatever funds they get for this purpose?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I understand that regarding H.R. 4158, the\r\nTreasury and the Justice Department have agreed that the language may\r\nbe changed so that it will read \"Assist\", is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that is satisfactory?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. That is what we worked out.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, in connection with your protection of the President,\r\nhave you drawn upon various people in the Government and consultants to\r\nassist you in regard to scientific problems?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; some 8 or 9 years ago, we evolved a relationship\r\nwith the Defense Department--I think more specifically in the last 4\r\nyears--a relationship with the President's Scientific Advisor.\r\n\r\nThis is off the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why, Chief?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That has to do with national security.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, do you find in work of the Secret Service\r\nthat you have need for scientific advice and consultation concerning\r\nproblems that develop regarding the protection of the President, so\r\nthat if you had some arrangement whereby you could have the assistance\r\nof either the President's Scientific Advisor or consultation with\r\nindependent consultants, it would assist and in fact be necessary to\r\nyour work?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think it would be a great help, and it is necessary\r\ntoday, because under the crash program that we are endeavoring to\r\nundertake, I think it is important that we know, in Presidential\r\nprotection, what the current devices are that are available and are\r\nefficient in connection with countermeasures against eavesdropping and\r\nother things that we have been researching over the years. But this is\r\nnot necessary on a day-to-day basis, and it could be on an informal\r\nbasis with other agencies. I think it is necessary to have somebody of\r\nthat type, who is conversant with the subject, a trained expert, who\r\nknows precisely where to go.\r\n\r\nWe might spend a lot of time going around the paths, but by having an\r\nexpert, he knows precisely the organization, the contracting company,\r\nwhat they have, whether it is suitable, whether it is efficient for our\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Rankin, is the letter of April 22, 1964, from\r\nMr. Rowley to you with the enclosures a Commission exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; that has been offered. That is Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1027.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In this enclosure, Chief Rowley, on page 4,\r\nunder subheading (c), the following is stated: \"The Secret Service\r\nhas no funds for research and very limited funds for the acquisition\r\nof protective devices. In the fiscal year 1964 budget, the Service\r\nrequested $23,057 for two positions for technical specialists. The\r\nCongress did not make any appropriation covering this request, and it\r\nwas repeated in the 1965 budget request, and has been included in the\r\nappropriation passed by the House several weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\nCould you define more particularly what you had in mind for these\r\nso-called technical specialists?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; this was someone that knew something about\r\nelectronics or electronic engineering for the sweeping of different\r\nplaces. We felt that to date we were utilizing the services of agents\r\nwho primarily came with us on the basis of criminal investigation, and\r\nthat, therefore, it was my feeling that we should have this type of\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I realize the shortcomings and the requirements\r\nwhich we are operating under--and I was endeavoring to get the funds\r\nfrom Congress, the personnel that I thought were necessary, as well\r\nas the equipment I thought we should have, primarily to have this\r\noperation under control for us.\r\n\r\nNow, I might say that the CIA has been most helpful. The equipment\r\nwe used in the early days were from that organization and the State\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nBut now they have gotten so busy, as you well know, that they haven't\r\ngot much time to assist us.\r\n\r\nSo that we feel we want to have our own equipment, our own experts, and\r\npeople that know our work, and devote their time to it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you talk about technical specialists here,\r\nyou are referring to electronics specialists?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You are not referring to a general research and\r\ndevelopment program, however?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; this confusion is why it was refused a year ago.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Let me ask this, then, Chief Rowley. Would\r\nthese technical experts, or technical specialists, have been on duty\r\nin Dallas on this particular trip if you had had the funds and had\r\nemployed them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; but they would have been employed in something\r\nentirely different.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. They wouldn't have had any relationship to the\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir. If I may go off the record.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us why you are going off the record?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Because it involves national security.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As I understand it, then, the deletion of these\r\nfunds for these technical specialists in fiscal year 1964 did not\r\nin any way handicap your operation in Dallas at the time of the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; we have never said that. We are just saying that if\r\nwe had the equipment--in other words, what I am trying to do, Mr.\r\nCongressman, is to move forward. And the only way I know, after a\r\nperiod of years, is to ask for a sum of money, but then my experience\r\nis that sometimes the Congress becomes alarmed. But this is a need that\r\nwe have. And this is what I am trying to explain. This is an example of\r\nwhat we are trying to do, in equipment and manpower.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, or Mr. Rankin, I have to go shortly\r\nover to a session of the House. And since we are in the budget area, I\r\nthink it might be well for the record to develop some facts concerning\r\nyour budget--what they have in the past and what you are suggesting\r\nthey might be in the future.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I have here a summary of the appropriation\r\nallocations as it applies to manpower and equipment, and the number of\r\npersons on the roll.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you receive your appropriations in a lump sum\r\nor how do you receive Secret Service appropriations?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I guess it is on a warrant. When the warrant is signed----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your budget is included as a part of the Treasury\r\nDepartment budget?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, do you have it in a separate part of the\r\nTreasury Department budget?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is it specifically earmarked for the Secret\r\nService?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It is; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is a lump sum for the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is a public appropriation, it is made public?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Congressman Ford, if I may interrupt just a minute, I can\r\nask Chief Rowley if Commission Exhibit No. 1028 is the one he just\r\nreferred to in answer to your question about the budget.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1028 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I then offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No. 1028.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1028, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Exhibit No. 1028, Chief Rowley, does include in this--so it\r\nwill be understandable to the Commission, the figures for your proposed\r\nbudget of 1966, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And those are shown in that manner on the exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is the figure we see here----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. This is what we call a tentative budget.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That has been presented to the Budget Bureau?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It has not been presented to the Budget Office of the\r\nTreasury, which is the first step. Then it goes to the Budget Bureau,\r\nand then subsequently to the House and Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said it has not been.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; this is a tentative proposal that we have made.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At this stage, so we get the record clear--that is a\r\nconsideration of what you think you should have, but it hasn't gone\r\nthrough the steps you have just described, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. But it does not include--necessarily, until\r\nwe complete our thorough examination--what our requirements will be\r\nunder the new revisions of our organization. Particularly as it relates\r\nto manpower, we want to be sure that we have the proper justification.\r\nAnd so we hope by October or November to have a good estimate at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, the figure that is shown here for fiscal\r\nyear 1965 is $7,550,000.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that the budget submission to the Congress?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. To the Congress; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And do you recall what the House approved in its\r\nversion of the bill?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. $7,500,000. They cut $50,000.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you recall what the reduction was predicated on?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; I don't. I think it was just cut to a round figure.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the footnote here which is entitled\r\n\"Pending action by the Senate\"? Is that a $669,000 increase?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that a supplemental?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, no; we are just showing the increase--this has nothing\r\nto do with the $669,000. We show--this was passed by the House, but it\r\nis now pending in the Senate for approval. In other words, you have\r\nyour markup or something, and then it hasn't been submitted to the\r\nHouse for a--to the Senate for approval.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there is an asterisk there.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; this is the 1965 budget. This figure that was reduced\r\nby $50,000, by the House. Now, it goes before--for a markup--it will be\r\nplaced before the Senate for approval.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, when you say \"this\" it doesn't show on the\r\nrecord what you are talking about. So if you can tell what item on that\r\nExhibit No. 1028.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the same line with the language, \"Pending\r\naction by Senate,\" on the right-hand side is $669,000, which is labeled\r\nas an increase. That increase relates to what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It relates to the difference--the increase between 1965\r\nand our proposed budget of 1966. The asterisk here relates to the 586\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there any connection between those two? Chief Rowley,\r\nis there any connection between the asterisk, and the wording \"Pending\r\nbefore the Senate,\" and the item on the right-hand column of the\r\nincrease?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; it represents the increase that we are asking for in\r\nthe 1966 budget.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You are not asking the Senate, though, to increase the\r\nHouse figure of $7,500,000, by $669,000.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, no; there is no connection between these increases.\r\nThis should have been down here, where you explain what the asterisk\r\nis, where we have 586. Maybe it was put in the wrong position there.\r\nIn other words, it is like a footnote. This is pending action--meaning\r\nthat the House has passed the 1965 budget, but the Senate has yet to\r\npass it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But to clarify, there is no connection between the\r\nincreased figure and the fact that it is pending before the Senate?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. It happens to be on the same line.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But there is no connection?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What you mean is the House has passed an appropriation\r\nof $7,500,000, and the Senate has not yet acted upon it.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The $669,000 is an increase that you hope will be voted\r\nin the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you present the budget yourself, or does the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, or someone else in the Treasury Department--present\r\nand defend it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The Secretary presents the overall Treasury budget, but\r\nthen in detail, we appear before the appropriations subcommittee\r\nourselves to justify our request.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Secret Service justifies its own request in the overall\r\nbudget of the Department of the Treasury?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Chief Rowley, on page 5 of Exhibit No. 1027,\r\nthe statement is made, \"In the fiscal year 1965, the Secret Service\r\nhas requested funds for an additional 25 positions. The House of\r\nRepresentatives has included the requested funds in the Treasury-Post\r\nOffice appropriation bill which passed several weeks ago. These funds\r\nwill not be sufficient to take the additional measures which we\r\nbelieve are required. However, since the 1965 budget figures had to be\r\nsubmitted in November 1963, it was not possible to make specific and\r\nproperly justified requests at that time. We should be in a position to\r\ndo so in the fiscal year 1966 budget submission.\"\r\n\r\nYou are not saying that you won't have whatever additional personnel\r\nyou need now, or from now until the beginning of fiscal year 1966, for\r\nthe protection of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; we are not saying that. We are saying that in view of\r\nthe circumstances of what happened in November, that this budget of 25\r\npositions had already been submitted, and there was nothing you could\r\ndo to take it back.\r\n\r\nThe 1966 budget was also prepared and submitted. But, as I explain\r\nlater, in all consideration, we cannot at this time helter skelter\r\nsay we need so many men, taking advantage of the tragedy. We want to\r\nexperiment and develop what we need in protective research in the way\r\nof manpower and equipment, and what we need in the field, because\r\nnecessarily we will have to have special agents added to the field to\r\nconduct any investigations on risks that may be forwarded to them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But if in the process of your analysis of\r\nyour needs, you develop that you need more personnel, you need new\r\ndevices, you need equipment of any sort whatsoever--you won't delay\r\nthe submission of that request just because of the fiscal year budget\r\ncoming up for fiscal 1966?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Because we do have, as you well know, supplemental\r\nand deficiency appropriation bills.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So if you need something, you can request it\r\nof the Bureau of the Budget, and if it can be justified, it can be\r\nsubmitted to the Congress in one of the other forms besides the regular\r\nappropriation bills.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. Because now as I understand it the same\r\ncommittee handles the supplemental.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We are aware of that. That is what we would do when we\r\narrive at what our requirements would be.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. We can have your assurance that if you come\r\nup with requirements, you won't wait for fiscal 1966 to make your\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, you are in the process of trying to arrive at\r\nyour estimates of what you need in additional personnel and equipment\r\nand other assistance to make the protective services and the Secret\r\nService in its work of protecting the President as efficient as\r\npossible, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are seeking the help and advice of people that you\r\nhave named, such as the Rand Corp., and others?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And do you have any estimate now that you can give the\r\nCommission as to when you might have your estimates in that regard?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I think, No. 1, with regard to the protective\r\nresearch, I think we need some expert there to assist us in developing\r\nour requirements, particularly in the criteria, on a full-time basis.\r\nWe have assigned what we thought were sufficient men at this time to\r\ncope with the volume of work and reports that we have been receiving,\r\nwhich are now being received from the various organizations of\r\napproximately a hundred reports a day. So that we have cut down to a\r\nconsiderable point.\r\n\r\nNow, following the evaluation and the processing of these reports, we\r\nwill determine just what we actually need in the way of manpower.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You also have the problem of being able to get that\r\nmaterial out once you have it, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. And this is the point that we have to\r\ndevelop with IBM, or, as I said initially, with the CIA.\r\n\r\nNow, they have facilities that would be available to us, if it works.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are also inquiring into the question of the\r\nsufficiency of the number of agents you have for this area as well as\r\nother Secret Service tasks?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are going to present that to the Congress as soon\r\nas you have something definite that you can support?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right--in response to Congressman Ford's inquiry.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, I think the Commission would be interested in the\r\nrequirements or standards that you have for agents. Do you require a\r\ncollege education now?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And are there any other conditions or standards that you\r\nwould like to describe?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I inquire for one point? Is that a college education\r\nfor the White House detail?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; that is for all the agents that we recruit for our\r\nwork, for both criminal and protective, Mr. Dulles. We require a\r\nminimum academic achievement of 4 years of college or university, and\r\npreferably those who attend police administrative schools, where they\r\nhave in their curricula subjects on science, criminology, and law. We\r\nfind that these people are better adapted, they have an inclination,\r\nand they are interested.\r\n\r\nBut we do take people with B.A.'s and B.S.'s, because they, too, have\r\nbeen most satisfactory. But we find when we need to recruit the men,\r\nwe go to these colleges with special courses. As I mentioned earlier\r\nwe first started recruiting them from Michigan State, because that was\r\none of the first universities with a police administration curriculum.\r\nAnd we found each and every one of them have been most satisfactory and\r\nhave excellent records.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, a good portion of them are agents in charge of our\r\n65 offices throughout the country.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you do as a matter of procedure in assigning your\r\nagents? Do you keep them in Presidential protection, or do you shift\r\nthem from that to other functions in the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, when they are first sworn into duty, we assign them to\r\nan office, so during the period, the first 6 months, you would call it\r\ninservice training, because we are not in the position that the FBI is\r\nwhere they take in, say, a given number of agents--let's set a figure\r\nat 30--and then they can start them immediately with their school of\r\n12 weeks. We are not in a position to hire that many at a time. We are\r\nin a position to hire 10. So that after 6 months, 10 now, after the\r\ncharacter investigations are completed, and then we may get 10 more\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThen we send them to what we call the Treasury Basic School, after\r\nwhich we try to send them as soon as practical to our Secret Service\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nNow, sometimes a new man might be a year in the Secret Service, and\r\nduring that period he is on probation, after which we determine through\r\nthe agent in charge whether his service is satisfactory, and whether he\r\nwill develop into an agent.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is the FBI School open to any of your respective recruits?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. FBI Academy.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The Police Academy would be if we had occasion to send them\r\nthere, if there was something they could benefit from. We do send the\r\nWhite House Police to the FBI Police Academy, because that is more in\r\nconnection with their police function.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How does your agent get into the Presidential protection?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, some of the agents have indicated in their personal\r\nhistory questionnaires submitted each year whether they wish to select\r\nan office of duty preference, and there are three offices listed. If an\r\nagent wants for one reason or another after a period of 3 years on the\r\nWhite House detail to make a request for a transfer, we consider which\r\nof the three offices he selected has a vacancy, and we assign him to\r\nthat office. Then we bring in one of the new men from the field service\r\nto replace him. We then train him in the protective work.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, you have to have a nucleus. So there are also a number of\r\nmen in supervisory positions who have been on the White House detail\r\nfor 20 or more years.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But your theory is that they should be able to be trained\r\nso that they could be shifted to any part of the service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. And it has this advantage: Once they are\r\ntrained in Presidential protection, if for some reason the White\r\nHouse detail gets instructions that the President is going to fly to\r\none of the cities, or some hamlet across the country, and we do not\r\nhave time to get an agent aboard a plane and send him there, or maybe\r\nthe Air Force has no plane available to transport him there, we pick\r\nup the phone and call an agent at the nearest place--and here is an\r\nagent that has been trained, he knows the mechanics of the operation,\r\nand the procedure, and he goes to work, and effectively lays out the\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, this Commission Exhibit No. 1028,\r\nwhich shows the budget and the positions, I think is helpful. But in\r\nthe submission of the budget by the Secret Service to the Congress,\r\nthey have a greater breakdown of their personnel setup.\r\n\r\nI think it might be wise to include what they submitted to the\r\nCongress, or something comparable to it, because I think it is far more\r\ncomplete than this.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And I think it might be helpful for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We do not disclose the number of men on Presidential\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I understand that. But you are familiar with\r\nthe presentation you might submit for your overall budget, including\r\npersonnel?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can that not be submitted for our record, just as\r\nit is submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It is a matter of public record. But whether or not the\r\ntentative one, the 1966 can be, before the Budget Bureau sees it, is\r\nsomething else again.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I would not expect that it would.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; but the others can be.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask leave to secure a copy of\r\nthat and insert it in the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted when you obtain it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask one other question, and then I have to\r\nleave?\r\n\r\nIn listening to the testimony, Chief Rowley, sometime ago, I was a\r\nlittle concerned--more than a little, I should say--with the process\r\nby which the man in charge of a Presidential trip undertakes his\r\nrelationship with the local law enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nAs I recall the testimony, the man in charge has contact with the local\r\npolice and the sheriff's department and any other local law enforcement\r\nagency. But the impression that I gained was that there was no clear\r\ndelineation of responsibility. They sat around, they talked about what\r\nthis local law enforcement agency would do and what another one would\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that a more precise checklist, a clear\r\nunderstanding, would be wholesome and better.\r\n\r\nWhat is your reaction on that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, No. 1, in our revised Manual on Presidential\r\nProtection, this is part of the thing.\r\n\r\nNow, I would hesitate to prepare a checklist for everybody, because you\r\nmay be embarrassed to find it in the press some day, because of the\r\nactivity of reporters around the police.\r\n\r\nI do not want to downgrade any police department, but this is what\r\nhappens through no fault of theirs. There are variations in different\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nNow, I think what you are referring to, Mr. Congressman, is that they\r\ncomplained they did not have a sufficient notice of the route and\r\nso forth, so they could make the proper preparations. That is true.\r\nNeither did we have sufficient notice. Because they were going back and\r\nforth trying to establish--until they were told they had 45 minutes\r\nallotted to them for this route, and first our man had to go, which is\r\na natural operation, to look over the route to see whether or not it\r\ncould be negotiated within that particular period of time.\r\n\r\nOnce establishing that it could, and the thing looked safe, then they\r\nnotified the police and went over it with the police. And then with the\r\npolice they indicated what they would like done here at intersections\r\nand so forth, and other features.\r\n\r\nNow, it is true in most cases we ourselves like to get sufficient\r\nadvance information, we like to send our men out in advance so they\r\ndo not have to cope with these fast operations, because when a police\r\ndepartment has sufficient notice of the route and so forth, then\r\nthey have adequate time to get out instructions to their own police\r\ndepartment--whether by precinct or by group commanders, and so forth.\r\nAnd this is what I think in this instance that they are complaining\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As I understand it, however, at the present time,\r\nand for the future, there will be a more precise procedure for the\r\nrelationships of the Secret Service on the one hand and local law\r\nenforcement agencies on the other.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is set forth in your manual as presently\r\nrevised?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. In our present revised manual.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So that when your agent-in-charge goes to city X,\r\nhe now has the procedures set forth for many to follow on, so there are\r\nno uncertainties, if that is possible?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. And you have to necessarily do that, because\r\nyou have agents, as I said--as I cited an example where an agent had\r\nbeen trained in the White House, but you have to utilize his services,\r\nbecause you cannot get a regular White House man out there. He has this\r\ninformation, and he follows it accordingly. It is a check for him as\r\nwell as for the police.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Other countries have protection problems of their\r\nchief executive.\r\n\r\nI am sure in recent months the French have had considerable problems in\r\nthis regard.\r\n\r\nDo you ever have an exchange of methods with other governments for your\r\nbenefit or their benefit?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. We have been approached, Mr. Congressman, for instructions\r\non security and so forth, but we, for reasons--for national security\r\nreasons, I would like to go off the record.\r\n\r\n(Off the record.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Back on the record.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You have referred to the dry runs which you made in Dallas,\r\nand you usually make, I understand, to establish a route.\r\n\r\nFirst I think you said you did this yourself, and then with the local\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you have any reason to believe that those dry runs were\r\nobserved by the President or known to the President, or received any\r\npublicity?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; they did not receive any publicity.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Chief, you were referring a little while ago to the\r\nrevised rules.\r\n\r\nWhen did the last revision take place? Has it been since the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No.\r\n\r\nThe overall revision of the Manual of the Secret Service, was\r\nundertaken before I took office, and because it was delayed, I took it\r\nupon myself to assign a man to sit down 7 days a week, to bring this\r\nmanual up to date. The overall manual has been completed. Now we have\r\nalmost completed the revised advance manual.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And--but there has been--as yet there has been no\r\nrevision since the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir; It is in the process.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It is in the process of being done? Very well.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I would like to ask a question. I think you stated\r\nthat you took part in the procedures and methods for the protection of\r\nPresident Kennedy when he was--prior to his visit to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I thought you said that you participated in a dry run.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Oh, no; I was describing what the advance agents do.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Anyway--you know what the agents of the Secret Service\r\ndid in preparing for the visit, of President Kennedy to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And you know what procedures they followed during the\r\nactual route of the motorcade on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, reviewing those, is there any failure that you\r\nknow about on the part of the Secret Service in those procedures or in\r\nthe methods which they used on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, would you tell us the salary scale for your\r\nagents for the first 2 years?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; we recruit an agent at grade GS-7, at $5,795.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How does that compare with the starting salary for the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think it is a difference of three grades. As I\r\nunderstand, the lowest FBI grade is GS-10.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. $10,000.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Grade 10.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What salary would that be?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It might be--for example, GS-11 is $8,410. Now, it could be\r\nsomewhere between $7,500 and $8,000.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you able to get at that salary the quality of men that\r\nyou should for this kind of work?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; we have found to date that we have been able--we\r\nhave been selective. And, of course, the fact that we have only\r\nappropriations for a limited number of men.\r\n\r\nFor example, today we have well over 40 men waiting to be accepted,\r\nwith completed investigations, some a year or more. Sometimes when we\r\nput in requests for a given number of men, we want to put those men on\r\nat the beginning of the fiscal year, so we undertake to recruit them\r\nand complete their investigation, so that everything--the character and\r\nthe physical is up to date--and we can put them on, if we get the funds\r\nprecisely at the beginning of the fiscal year.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You recognize that your starting salary is not favorable in\r\ncomparison with some police forces, do you not?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I recognize that. But at the same time, we are guided by\r\nthe Treasury law enforcement examinations, and the other Treasury\r\ninvestigative standards. But we are below some of the west coast police\r\norganizations, for example. They are well-paid and great organizations.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, what kind of a workload do your agents have on an\r\naverage?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, at the present time we have a caseload of 110.1 cases\r\nper man.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How does that compare with other intelligence agencies?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I think--a satisfactory caseload per man per month is\r\nfrom 14 to 15 cases.\r\n\r\nNow, I am quite certain that in other agencies it is a little more than\r\nthat. But whether or not it is as high as ours at the present time, I\r\nhave no way of knowing at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you thing that is a handicap to your operation?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, it is a handicap. But I think it is testimony to the\r\ndedication and the industry of our men, that we are not complaining. We\r\nare conducting ourselves and performing our services for the Government\r\nto the point that even though we are understaffed, nevertheless we are\r\nnot quitters, and we are carrying on the work within the responsibility\r\nentrusted to us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you write the Commission a letter telling the history\r\nof the early development and growth of the Secret Service operation\r\nover the years?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is Commission Exhibit No. 1029 that information that you\r\ngave us?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir; this also included the White House police.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you examine Commission Exhibit No. 1029, and inform us\r\nas to whether or not any of that should not be included on the public\r\nrecord in light of the national security problem?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no objections, because in the years past--this is\r\npart of the public record. So I would not see any objection at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1029.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked for identification as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1029, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did you write us a letter with regard to\r\nproposed legislation, dated June 11?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And is Commission Exhibit No. 1030 that letter that you\r\nwrote us with an attachment telling about possible legislative changes\r\nthat you thought might be desirable?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked for identification as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1030.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No. 1030.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1030, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you briefly state the contents of the attachment to\r\nthat exhibit, Chief Rowley?\r\n\r\nYou recall that it is a commentary on the suggestion of legislation\r\nabout the assassination of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes; it is a recommendation on the bills being proposed,\r\nthat the assassination of a President or Vice President or possible\r\nsuccessors to the Presidency be made a Federal crime.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Currently there is such a law whereby when people of lesser\r\nrank in the Government are murdered, that is investigated by Federal\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you tell the Commission briefly what your idea is as\r\nto whether or not it would be helpful to have such a statute?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I think today it would be helpful, because it would be\r\na continuation of the present law, and it would be under Federal\r\njurisdiction--because this is a Federal employee. And I think it\r\nproperly should be under Federal statute. There would then be an\r\nopportunity particularly today in the case of the President or Vice\r\nPresident, for the investigation to be pursued immediately, and the\r\nassassin or groups of defendants to be interrogated as promptly as\r\npossible to develop and ascertain whether or not there is a conspiracy,\r\nand not wait as we have to do under the present law because of the\r\nState statute.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any suggestions in your proposal about who\r\nwould have jurisdiction to investigate and report in regard to any\r\nviolation of that law?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Currently the Federal enforcement agencies--namely, the\r\nFBI--have the responsibility of conducting investigations, on most of\r\nthe Federal laws in the country, and therefore it might properly be\r\ntheir responsibility in a situation like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do have a reservation with respect to an attempt or threat\r\non the President, because we would like to work out an agreement\r\nwhereby we would jointly conduct an investigation because the threat\r\nphase of it has been under our jurisdiction, under section 3056, for\r\nmany years. It ties in with our responsibility for protection of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In connection with the investigation of the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, have you personally participated in working with\r\nregard to that, in supervision of that investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. In the early stages when we assigned our men to inquire\r\ninto the background of Oswald and all. But then eventually, when the\r\nPresident authorized the FBI to conduct the investigation, we pulled\r\nout and only continued and finished up those reports that we initiated.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And since that time, after the FBI was given the authority\r\nto proceed with the investigation, you have cooperated with the\r\nCommission through the staff, your staff, in helping with various items\r\nof information from time to time. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, do you have any information of a credible nature that\r\nwould suggest to you that Oswald was or could have been an agent or\r\ninformant of any Federal agency?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no credible information of that kind; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was he an agent or informant or directly or indirectly\r\nconnected with the Secret Service in anyway?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Not in any way. We did not know of him until the event.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. From the way that the Secret Service employment is\r\narranged, and the records are kept, and the payments are made, if he\r\nhad ever been placed in any such capacity with the Secret Service,\r\nwould it have come to your attention?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. It would; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are certain that he never was hired directly or\r\nindirectly or acted in that capacity.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. He was never hired directly or indirectly in any capacity.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any credible information that would cause you\r\nto believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was an agent of any foreign country.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no such credible information.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any credible information to cause you to\r\nbelieve that he was involved in any conspiracy in connection with the\r\nassassination, either domestic or foreign?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no credible information on any of those.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are there any areas of the investigation of the Commission\r\nthat you would suggest that further work should be done, as far as you\r\nknow the work of the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. From your knowledge of the investigation, do you have any\r\nopinion as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the killing of\r\nthe President?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. From what reports I have read, I would say that he was\r\ninvolved in the killing of the President, but I do not have complete\r\nknowledge of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any opinion from your knowledge of the\r\ninvestigation as to whether Mr. Ruby was associated with anyone else\r\ndirectly or indirectly in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have incomplete knowledge with respect to Ruby.\r\nConsequently, I could not say, other than what I saw on television or\r\nread in the newspapers, whether he had any connections.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything in connection with the work of the\r\nCommission or what you know about our inquiry here that you would like\r\nto add to or suggest that the Commission do beyond what you know of it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question?\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin asked you several questions. He asked you if you had\r\ncredible information, which I think was a proper question. But may I\r\nask if you have any information based upon any facts that you know or\r\nbased upon any information given to you by persons who claim to have\r\npersonal knowledge, that there were persons engaged in a conspiracy to\r\nkill President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no such facts, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I address the same question as to whether you have any\r\ninformation that the killing of President Kennedy had any connection\r\nwith any foreign power?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I have no such information.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles, any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes, sir; I have one general question.\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony, and from my own study, it would seem to me that it\r\nwas likely that there would be parallel, somewhat parallel structures\r\nto develop the investigative capabilities with regard to possible\r\nsuspects in the area of Presidential protection. And my question is\r\nas to whether, in order to avoid that undue expense, you think there\r\nwould be any advantage in putting the responsibility of that within the\r\nFBI, who would then be responsible for advising you as to potential\r\nsuspects and possibly following up on that, rather than putting that\r\nresponsibility now to a certain extent on the Secret Service--whether\r\nthere is not a division of responsibility in this field which is\r\nunfortunate and may possibly lead to greater expense, personnel doing\r\nsomewhat duplicative work?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. As it applies to this law now?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As it applies to the situation today, without the law which\r\nis recommended in your memorandum, and might apply also after that,\r\nbecause the investigation would be required in either case to turn up\r\npossible suspects.\r\n\r\nMy question is, where should that responsibility be primarily centered\r\nin order to avoid undue duplication and expense, and yet accomplish our\r\nobjective?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, when you mention duplication, I do not think there\r\nhas been much duplication in this case, when the President directed the\r\nFBI to conduct the investigation to determine whether or not there was\r\na conspiracy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am not talking about now. I am talking about\r\ninvestigation prior to, say, the President's visit to city X in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or abroad--where you have the problem of the Secret Service\r\nand the CIA.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I think you want to keep the concept of Presidential\r\nprotection by a small, closely knit group, because of the intimate\r\nrelationship. But if you want to expand it and give it to another\r\ngroup, to take the long-range view, you do not know what may develop\r\nfrom something like that--whether a police organization could lead to\r\na police state or a military state--if you want to delegate it to some\r\norganization like that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I suppose also, Chief Rowley, that if your people were\r\nnot doing the spadework on this thing, and keeping their minds steeped\r\nin this protection matter, but were obliged to rely on the written\r\nrecords of someone else presented to you, that they would not be in the\r\nproper state of mind, would they, to be alert to it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. There would be a tendency to relax and say\r\nJohn Jones is taking care of it. This is always the possibility that\r\nyou might encounter something like that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And in law enforcement, you have to have the feel of the\r\nsituation, do you not?\r\n\r\nYou have to do the spadework in order to be aware of every possibility\r\nthat might develop?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is true. Because you see in this, Mr. Dulles, on the\r\nPresidential detail, it is a unique detail. This is something that they\r\nthink 24 hours a day. They do it 24 hours a day. They are not otherwise\r\ninvolved. For example, they have the principle of screening the\r\nPresident and being always ready to make a quick exit. They do not have\r\nto stop to investigate or identify any person, whoever the assailant\r\nmight be. Their responsibility is only to protect the President at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But they have to know against whom to protect him.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. That is right. But they are ready for anything under the\r\npresent close screening.\r\n\r\nBut if I understand your question, Mr. Dulles, you also want to know\r\nwhether or not in the screening or the investigation of certain\r\ngroups, like the Communist group, and so forth, since it is their\r\nresponsibility and not ours, because they have the internal security of\r\nthe United States, this is something that we have to develop.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is \"they\" the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. The FBI.\r\n\r\nThat is something that we have to have a formal arrangement about,\r\nbecause it enters the realm of internal security. We do not want to\r\nconflict with them, if that is what is uppermost in your mind. We have\r\nto be most correct about that, in any of the agencies, as you know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How much larger staff do you think you are going to have to\r\nhave to cover that situation in the future?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Well, I would not know until we see the volume of reports\r\nthat we get that we have to refer to the field for investigation. Since\r\nwe are processing them now, we have to wait to make that determination.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Should you do field investigations as contrasted with the\r\nFBI--the FBI have a large number of people in a large number of cities\r\nthroughout the United States. You do not have that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. No; but on the basis of the criteria we discussed earlier,\r\nthe FBI would give us the information, and if in our evaluation we\r\ndetermined that it should be referred to the field for investigation,\r\nparticularly in the case of individuals, we would conduct our\r\ninvestigation, to determine whether this individual is a high risk to\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nNow, where it comes to the group, this is something for the FBI to do,\r\nbecause it ties in with their responsibility for internal security.\r\n\r\nNow, if there is a close connection between the two, then we would have\r\nto have a formal agreement. But because of our responsibility, and the\r\nfact that this is part of the work that we have to undertake, then\r\nwe would conduct our own investigation, because we know what we are\r\nlooking for.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. If the name of Lee Harvey Oswald had been submitted to you\r\nby the FBI, what would you, in the normal course, have done?\r\n\r\nWould you have referred that back to them for investigation, or would\r\nyou have carried on an independent investigation?\r\n\r\nI am talking now if that name had been referred to you when you knew\r\nyou were going to go to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. If we knew we were going to go to Dallas and we had this\r\npresent criteria, then we would investigate him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You would carry on the investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I am through with Chief Rowley\r\nnow--except I would like to ask him to supply a copy of the information\r\nabout their appropriation request, and insert it with Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1028. [The information subsequently furnished by the Secret\r\nService was inserted in the record as a part of Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1028.]\r\n\r\nWe have Mr. Carswell here. As you recall, there was some difficulty\r\nat one meeting about the testimony about what the Secret Service was\r\ndoing in regard to the Speaker. And while he is here, I would like to\r\nstraighten that record out.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It will be very brief.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Chief, I want to take this opportunity to thank you and\r\nthe members of your Secret Service for the cooperation you have given\r\nto this Commission. They have been very diligent, very helpful, as you\r\npersonally have been. And we appreciate it.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLEY. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT CARSWELL\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Carswell, you have been sworn, have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. CARSWELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. You may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, if the Commission will bear with me\r\njust a minute, I would like to tell about my own conversation with\r\nthe Speaker about this matter prior to his answering in regard to\r\ncorrection of the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. You may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After the matter came up before the Commission, I was asked\r\nby one of the Commissioners to see the Speaker, Mr. McCormack, and I\r\ndid that at his office. And he informed me that the Secret Service\r\nand also the FBI had undertaken to try to give him protection because\r\nof his position in the line of succession, and that because of the\r\ninterference that he felt and his wife felt with their relationship\r\nover the years in being alone and together in their family life, he\r\ndid not like to have that interference, and he asked them not to\r\nparticipate any more in furnishing that protection for him. He said it\r\nwas his own responsibility in taking that action, and he wanted that to\r\nbe clear, and that he thought that as far as any protection he needed,\r\nhe had plenty of protection with the kind of protection that the\r\nCongress had around him in the performance of his duty.\r\n\r\nIt came to Mr. Carswell's attention, right immediately after he had\r\ntestified, that his statements in that regard were inaccurate because\r\nof the change that had occurred that had not come to his attention. He\r\ncalled me and he said he would like to correct the record.\r\n\r\nMr. Carswell, will you tell us now what the facts are as you have\r\nlearned?\r\n\r\nMr. CARSWELL. When I testified here before I was asked, I believe, what\r\nprotection the Secret Service was providing the Speaker. I said that we\r\nwere providing protection comparable to that previously provided to the\r\nVice President. I did that on the basis of checking with Chief Rowley\r\nimmediately after the assassination of President Kennedy, and he told\r\nme at that time such protection was being provided to the Speaker.\r\n\r\nI understood that that was the case the next day--because at that time\r\nwe were not certain what was going on. I had not heard anything about\r\nit after that. And I assumed that the situation continued as it was\r\nimmediately after the assassination. But that was not the case.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Rankin has stated, the Speaker requested the Secret Service to\r\ndiscontinue assigning agents to him for protection, and we did what he\r\nrequested. That is the present situation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nThank you, Mr. Carswell.\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, I think that will be all today. The Commission will\r\nadjourn now.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, June 23, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BERNARD WILLIAM WEISSMAN AND ROBERT G. KLAUSE\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 10:30 a.m., on June 23, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and\r\nAllen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; and Albert E. Jenner,\r\nJr., assistant counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BERNARD WILLIAM WEISSMAN, ACCOMPANIED BY THOMAS A.\r\nFLANNERY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n(Members present: Chief Justice Warren, Representative Ford, and Mr.\r\nDulles.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order. Mr. Flannery, you are\r\nhere representing Mr. Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. FLANNERY. Yes; Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Jenner, would you mind making a brief statement of\r\nthe testimony we expect to develop here?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard William Weissman, who is the witness today, played some\r\npart in the preparation of and the publication of the advertisement\r\nin the Dallas Morning News on the 22d of November 1963, and we will\r\nseek to develop the facts with respect to that. It has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1031, entitled \"Welcome, Mr. Kennedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1031 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Weissman's deposition was taken in part. He was not\r\nthen represented by counsel, and he had some qualms about it and raised\r\nthe issue, and as soon as it was raised we suspended the deposition. He\r\nappears this morning with Mr. Flannery as his counsel.\r\n\r\nMr. Flannery, would you be good enough to state your full name?\r\n\r\nMr. FLANNERY. Thomas A. Flannery.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And you are a practitioner in Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. FLANNERY. Yes; Your Honor, I am a partner in the firm of Hamilton\r\nand Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Weissman; will you raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you shall give will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated? Mr. Jenner will question.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your full name is Bernard William Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you now reside in New York City, do you not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Mount Vernon, N.Y.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you give your address?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. 439 South Columbus Avenue, Mount Vernon, N.Y.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were born November 1, 1937?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are almost 27 years old?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. I would like some vital statistics, if I may,\r\nMr. Weissman. Are you presently employed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And where are you employed presently?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Carpet Corp. of America, 655 Clinton Avenue, Newark, N.J.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Is that connected in any fashion with the Carpet Co.\r\nby which you were employed in Dallas, Tex., last fall?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are a native born American?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your folks are as well?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Excuse me?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your folks are as well, mother and father?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have two brothers?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And they likewise are native born Americans?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is your marital status at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Separated.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were married or are married to Jane Byrnes Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She is a native born American, also?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have been separated since when?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. May 16, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So you became separated from her before you went to Dallas\r\nin the fall of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I was in the service at the time.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, are you acquainted with a gentleman by the name of\r\nLarrie Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first meet him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Munich, Germany, about July or August of 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His middle name is Henry. Are you aware of that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I am not aware of that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where does he reside?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, he was in Dallas. I understand he has dropped from\r\nsight. I don't know where he is now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he residing in Dallas in the fall of 1963 when you were\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you arrive in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Dallas, on the 4th of November 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was Mr. Schmidt aware that you were about to come to\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what was the purpose of your coming to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I will be as brief as possible. It was simply to follow\r\nthrough on plans that we had made in Germany, in order to develop a\r\nconservative organization in Dallas, under our leadership.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did that conservative organization, or your purpose in\r\ngoing to Dallas, as well, have any business context in addition to\r\npolitics?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I would say 50 percent of the purpose was business and\r\nthe other 50 percent politics. We figured that only rich men can\r\nindulge full time in politics, so first we had to make some money\r\nbefore we could devote ourselves to the political end completely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In short compass; would you tell the Commission your\r\nbackground up to the time that you entered military service, and give\r\nus the date of the entry of military service?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Do you mean as far as my schooling and where I lived\r\nbefore then? Before I went into the service?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Let's take it from high school.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I graduated from Edison Technical High School in Mount\r\nVernon in June of 1956, went to work for the Nuclear Development Corp.\r\nas an experimental machinist in July of that year and left them in\r\nAugust of 1957. I then went on the road with my brother, Joe, and\r\nhis wife, working as demonstrators or pitchmen, you might say, in\r\ndepartment stores, selling some patent medicines and the like. Did this\r\nfor about--oh, that was from the 18th of November 1957 up until about\r\nApril or May of 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your brother Joe is a little bit older than you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He is 20 months older, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And his given name is Joe, and not Joseph?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Joseph. Then--let's see--I went to work for the American\r\nSchools of Music, which my brother founded in Jersey.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which brother?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. My brother Joe--in New Jersey. And I stayed with him as\r\nhis sales manager for a little over a year.\r\n\r\nThen I went to work for Encyclopedia Americana, Harvard Classics\r\nDivision, as a district sales manager. I was with them about a\r\nyear--until 19--I believe it was September of 1960.\r\n\r\nI was starving, so I went to work for Underwood Olivetti, in Newark,\r\nN.J., and I sold typewriters and calculators up until May of 1961, at\r\nwhich time I quit, tried to go into business for myself in costume\r\njewelry, formed a corporation known as Jane Williams Co., Inc., and in\r\nAugust of 1961, I was drafted into the Army. That was on August 5, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were honorably discharged from the Army in August 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. August 5; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What has been your father's occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, for about 20 years he was plant superintendent for\r\nUniversity Loudspeakers in White Plains, N.Y. They moved to some place\r\nout west. He quit and went back to work with Local 3 in New York City,\r\nIBW.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your father's name is Harry?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Harry Weissman; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you reside with him now at 439 South Columbus Avenue in\r\nMount Vernon?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were discharged from the Army honorably?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were married when, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. November 7, 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A New York girl?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yonkers, N.Y.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have some children?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You separated, as you have indicated. Now, would you start\r\nfrom the Army?\r\n\r\nBefore I get to that, you met Larrie Schmidt in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What other buddies did you have in the Army with whom you\r\nagain renewed your acquaintance when you were discharged from the Army\r\nand went to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Only one beside Larrie. That was Bill Burley. William\r\nBurley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What contact did you have with Mr. Larrie Schmidt and Mr.\r\nBurley after you left the Army, which eventually brought you to Dallas?\r\nState it in your own words and chronologically, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I got out of service on the 5th, and I spent the\r\nmonth of August looking for a job. During this time, I had been in\r\ncontact with Larrie. I had telephoned him once during August. Things\r\nwere pretty bad. I didn't have any money. As far as I could ascertain\r\nhe was broke himself. There wasn't any percentage in going to Dallas\r\nand not accomplishing anything. As a matter of fact, I had lost a good\r\ndeal of confidence in Larrie in the year that he left Munich and was in\r\nDallas, and the letters I got from him--he seemed to have deviated from\r\nour original plan. I wasn't too hot about going. He didn't seem to be\r\naccomplishing anything, except where it benefited him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say he deviated from the original plan. What was the\r\noriginal plan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, the original plan was to stay away from various\r\norganizations and societies that were, let's call them, radical, and\r\nhad a reputation as being such.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say radical, what do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I mean radical right. And I considered myself more of an\r\nidealist than a politician. Larrie was more of a politician than an\r\nidealist. He went with the wind--which is good for him, I guess, and\r\nbad for me.\r\n\r\nIn any case Larrie wrote me easily a dozen letters imploring me to come\r\ndown, telling me in one that he doesn't need me down there, but he\r\nwould love to have my help because he can't accomplish anything without\r\nme, and in the next one saying, \"Forget it, I don't need you,\" and so\r\nforth. As the letters came, they went with the wind, depending on what\r\nhe was doing personally. And along about the end of October, I had been\r\nin contact with Bill--he was in Baltimore, Md., selling hearing aids.\r\nHe wasn't getting anywhere. He was making a living.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to this point each of you was barely making a living?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you had no capital?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No funds of your own?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None at all. And I got in touch with Bill. Actually, I\r\nforgot how it was. He wrote me a letter and I wrote him a letter. In\r\nany case, it came about that I invited Bill up to Mount Vernon, because\r\nhe figured if there was any money to be made it would be made in New\r\nYork, because this is a salesman's paradise. I invited Bill to Mount\r\nVernon. He came up about the last week of August.\r\n\r\nI am sorry--October of 1963. And we set up about looking for work and\r\ntrying to find him work, that is--I was working for the Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica, Great Books Division, as a district manager in Westchester\r\nCounty. So I more or less supported Bill the best I could. I fed him\r\nand gave him a room to sleep in and so forth.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Larrie had up to a point--hadn't accomplished anything\r\nin the way that we could use gainfully or to our purposes in Dallas. So\r\nthere was really no reason to go down there--up until about, I guess,\r\nthe 26th or 28th of October.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. Why were you thinking of Dallas at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I kept getting these letters from Larrie. I tried\r\nto forget about it, and he constantly reminded me. Once or twice a week\r\nI would get a letter. And it was a question--I was almost obligated to\r\ngo, because I had promised I would be there. And still having somewhat\r\nof a close relationship with Larrie, through my promises, I sort of\r\nfelt morally obligated to go down there.\r\n\r\nAnd, at the same time, it was new, different, exciting, it had a lot of\r\npromise for the future if it worked out.\r\n\r\nSo Adlai Stevenson was down there in the latter part of October.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. And I didn't pay too much attention to this--until the\r\nevening of Stevenson's speech at the Dallas Auditorium. And I got a\r\nlong distance telephone call from Larrie, and he explained what had\r\nhappened--that Stevenson had been struck by several individuals down\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please call on your best recollection and tell us what he\r\nsaid to you. You recall that he made that telephone call?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You recognized his voice?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are clear it was Larrie Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He said that big things are happening, and he went--this\r\nis before it hit the papers. He told me what had happened with Adlai\r\nStevenson.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Something like, \"I think we are\" he always speaks I this\r\nand I that. \"I have made it, I have done it for us,\" something to this\r\neffect. In other words, this is not exactly his words. I don't recall\r\nhis exact words. But this is essentially it. And that----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you say to him, \"What do you mean you have made it for\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. When he said, \"I have made it for us,\" meaning Larrie\r\nSchmidt--meaning me and Bill and whoever else was going to come down\r\nhere----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Bill Burley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you say when he made that remark?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I said \"Great.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did it mean to you, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. What did it mean to me?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is a generalization.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is it. In other words, I didn't really know what to\r\nthink. I had to go along with him, because I didn't know anything about\r\nit, aside from what he told me.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"If we are going to take advantage of the situation, or if\r\nyou are,\" meaning me, \"you better hurry down here and take advantage\r\nof the publicity, and at least become known among these various\r\nrightwingers, because this is the chance we have been looking for to\r\ninfiltrate some of these organizations and become known,\" in other\r\nwords, go along with the philosophy we had developed in Munich.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I go back a little bit, please. You received a\r\ntelephone call from Mr. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At that moment, you knew nothing about the Adlai Stevenson\r\nincident, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I had received a letter from him several weeks before\r\nsaying that--if you will wait just a minute, I think I might have the\r\nletter with me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. While you are looking, what was your rank when\r\nyou were discharged?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Pfc.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you reach any higher rank when you were in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; this is a letter I received on October 1, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For purposes of identification, we will mark that as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1033.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1033 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. May I approach the witness, Mr. Chief Justice?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is marked only for identification for the moment.\r\n\r\nMr. FLANNERY. The record will reflect it is a three-page letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMarked Commission Exhibit No. 1033, is that not correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; that is correct. Now, in Exhibit No. 1033, the\r\nletter I received from Larrie on October 1--that was typed on October\r\n1, 1963, and mailed on 7 October 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are looking at the envelope in which the letter was\r\nenclosed when you received it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is correct. And he states in the last paragraph of\r\nhis letter in a postscript, \"My brother has begun working as an aide\r\nto General Walker. He is being paid full time, et cetera. Watch your\r\nnewspaper for news of huge demonstrations here in Dallas on October\r\n3 and 4 in connection with U.N.-day and Adlai Stevenson speech here.\r\nPlans already made, strategy being carried out.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the only advance notice I had of this. And I didn't give it\r\ntoo much thought, because he had said many things like it before, just\r\nto build something up, and nothing ever came of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that document signed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; it is not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does it bear a typed signature?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have occasion to speak with Mr. Schmidt respecting\r\nthe contents of that letter at any time subsequent to your receiving it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever talk with him about having received that\r\nparticular letter, that he acknowledged having sent to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; as a matter of fact, I was pretty worried about his\r\nbrother becoming involved with General Walker, and I thought it might\r\ngive us a black eye.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what did you do--call Mr. Schmidt or talk with him on\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall if I spoke with him, or if I wrote it to\r\nhim in a letter. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you had occasion to confirm the fact that the letter\r\nnow identified as Commission Exhibit No. 1033 was written by Mr.\r\nSchmidt and mailed to you in an envelope, which we will mark as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1033-A?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1033-A for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear my question?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Repeat it, please.\r\n\r\n(The question, as recorded, was read by the reporter.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that when you had your telephone conversation which you\r\nwere in the course of relating, with Mr. Schmidt, you were aware when\r\nhe made the exclamation which you have described, of that to which he\r\nwas then referring--that is, the Stevenson incident?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there anything else in Mr. Schmidt's letter that\r\ndisturbed you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I received so many.\r\n\r\nWould it be permissible to--excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenner, would it be permissible to read this letter into the record?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. My trouble is, Mr. Weissman, and Mr. Flannery--I haven't\r\nseen the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I suppose Mr. Jenner could see the letter for a moment,\r\ncouldn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Definitely; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Flannery, would you be good enough to pass it up?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. You see, up to the point of that letter--excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, it is quite apparent to me, from\r\nglancing through the letter, that this is a letter that we--in\r\nconnection with Mr. Weissman's testimony, that we would like to offer\r\nin evidence in due course.\r\n\r\nAnd, with that in mind, Mr. Weissman, it will not be necessary for\r\nyou to read paragraphs from the letter, unless in the course of your\r\ntestimony you feel it will round out your testimony and serve to\r\nrefresh your recollection as to events you might wish to relate.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I would like to take a look at it now.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Ready?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Reporter, would you be good enough to read, let us say,\r\nthe last question and answer of the witness?\r\n\r\n(The question and answer, as recorded, was read by the reporter.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The point I was making, Mr. Weissman, was that when you\r\nreceived the telephone call about which you were testifying, in which\r\nMr. Schmidt exclaimed, \"I have made it for us,\" or words to that\r\neffect, you were then aware of that to which he was referring, at least\r\nin general?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that was the reason why you didn't ask him to elaborate\r\nupon what he meant by, \"I have made it for us\"?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was the fact that he, as you understood it, am I\r\ncorrect in saying, had had something to do with the organization of the\r\npicketing or other demonstrations at the time that Mr. Stevenson made\r\nhis visit to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, at the time I was almost--Larrie led me to believe\r\nthat he had organized the whole thing. And it transpired when I got to\r\nDallas that I found that he had led a group of 11 University of Dallas\r\nstudents in quiet picketing near the entrance to the auditorium, and\r\ndidn't engage in any physical violence of any sort.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But up to the time that you arrived in Dallas, you were\r\nunder the impression that he had had a more extensive part?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is what he led me to believe. In other words, he\r\nwas trying to--he wanted to get me to Dallas in the worst way. And he\r\nwanted it to look like he was on the hot seat and he would be there\r\nunless I came down to help him. In other words, he is throwing my\r\nobligation at me. And trying to convince me in various ways, as I\r\nmentioned, to come down there, so we can get moving on what we had\r\nplanned in Munich.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive a letter from him dated October 29, 1963,\r\na copy of which I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 1032, and I\r\ntender to you. You may have the original among your papers.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1032 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did receive this letter, Exhibit No. 1032, from\r\nLarrie, about the 29th of October.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And, gentlemen of the Commission, this is a letter dated,\r\nas the witness has stated--it is addressed to, \"Dear Bernie and Bill,\"\r\nand I assume Bill is----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Bill Burley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was then staying with you in New York?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it is signed Larrie. By the way, do you have the\r\noriginal of this letter with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't think so. Let me see. No; as a matter of fact,\r\nI believe the situation was when I gave the letter to the FBI, they\r\nasked me if I needed it back right away, and I said no--I didn't see\r\nany value in it, frankly. And then I spoke with Mr. Reedy, the agent\r\nwho had conducted the investigation at the FBI headquarters in New\r\nYork, and he said, \"Do you want the letter?\" And I said, \"I don't\r\nparticularly need it,\" and I don't recall if I ever got it back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. But the document which has been marked with an\r\nexhibit number is a true and correct copy of the letter you received\r\nfrom Larrie Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It seems to be; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, in that letter, there is a reference to CUSA in\r\ncapital letters. What is CUSA, what was CUSA? What was its genesis?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, CUSA, the letters stand for Conservatism USA, for\r\nlack of a better name. Larrie had originally founded this himself--as\r\nfar as I know he had originally founded this himself in Munich some\r\ntime in 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mean it was a concept of his?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know if it was his. But I was led to believe the\r\nconcept was his; and when I became associated with him, almost a year\r\nafter he had started to develop this organization----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And while you were still in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. While I was still in the Army; right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What was your rank in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Private, first class.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That is when you completed your service?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; at the time I was pfc, also.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How long were you in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Two years.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. When you were separated you were private, first\r\nclass?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. Here is how it came about. I had been in\r\nthe field on an Army training test. And I had been discussing just\r\npolitical views, foreign policy especially.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is this Germany, now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; this is Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who was the overall commander in Germany at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The overall commander?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was General Walker one of the commanders at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; he had been removed at that time. In any case, he\r\nwould have been about 60 or 70 miles--he was based in Landshut, Germany.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I was on this army training test with my company, MP\r\nCompany, and I was talking to the company clerk--he had a book. We just\r\ngot onto a discussion of politics, just generally. And I expounded some\r\nviews on foreign policy, and where I agreed or disagreed. And I went\r\ninto some great detail. And he said, \"Gee, if I didn't know better I\r\nwould say it is Larrie speaking.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went into this CUSA organization. He was at that time a partner\r\nin CUSA. It was set up as a business.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What does CUSA mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Conservatism USA.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What was Mr. Schmidt's rank?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He was specialist fourth class, SP-4, and he was in\r\ncharge of public relations for Armed Forces Recreation Centers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How old a man is he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie is 26 or 27.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About the same age as yours?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And Mr. Burley?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Twenty-nine now, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A little older--about 2 years older than you and Mr.\r\nSchmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In there. A year and a half, 2 years, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. What was his rank?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Corporal. At the time that I met Bill he was a pfc. In\r\nfact, Bill Burley didn't become really involved in this until, I would\r\nsay, 2 or 3 months before we left Germany. We left there about the\r\nsame time, we were discharged about the same time; and, anyway, I was\r\ntalking to the company clerk, Norman Baker, who was a partner in CUSA.\r\nI didn't know this at the time; but he just said he wanted to introduce\r\nme to somebody.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was the rank of the company clerk?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At that time--I think he was the only corporal company\r\nclerk in the army. And he introduced me to Larrie several weeks later\r\nafter we had returned from the field.\r\n\r\nThey tried to pull a big snow job, saying public relations and so on\r\nand so forth, just to sort of impress me, and they did. They worked\r\nvery well together; and, in any case, I became involved in it.\r\n\r\nI don't recollect the step-by-step involvement--just that I jumped in\r\nwith both feet, because I liked the idea.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was Conservatism USA, and it consisted of an idea at\r\nthis particular time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And associated with that idea were these people, Larrie\r\nSchmidt, yourself, was Burley----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At that time, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But he did become?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Later.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the company clerk--what was his name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Norman Baker.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And yourself--what was that--five? Were there any others?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There were others, but it was the sort of thing where\r\nthey were involved but not involved. They were just sort of going along\r\nfor the ride, because it was interesting, and you might say a little\r\ndiverse from the humdrum army life.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was CUSA ever organized formally in the sense of corporate\r\norganization or drafting of partnership papers and registration under\r\nthe Assumed Name Act in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Texas; no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it it was organized?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As a corporation or partnership?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. As a partnership.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In what state?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Munich, Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. And that was a sort of declaration among you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was a written declaration; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who drafted that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We did--that is, we called ourselves--the hangers-on were\r\nidentified as the outer circle, and the partners were the inner circle.\r\nThis was just for ease of identification. This, I think, would be the\r\neasiest way to really express it.\r\n\r\nAnd the partners, the five partners, were the inner circle, the leaders\r\nof this organization; and----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, may I interrupt for just a minute? I have an\r\nappointment I must keep at the court.\r\n\r\nCongressman Ford, will you preside, please?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Surely.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you proceed, please, Mr. Jenner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you. In short compass, tell us the objectives of CUSA.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, the objectives of CUSA were substantially to set\r\nup a political business organization. We used a rough comparison with\r\nFord and the Ford Foundation as an example. The Ford Foundation would\r\nbe CUSA, Conservatism USA, and the Ford would be AMBUS, or American\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was AMBUS?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. American business. This was the business half of the\r\npolitical organization.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was to be a combination of business and politics?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. We were going to use the business end----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which you called AMBUS?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would be----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. American business, or American businesses.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I don't get the initials. A-B-U-S?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. A-M-B-U-S--American business.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. And we were trying to develop, in our own minds, without\r\nactually doing it at the time, ways to build up various businesses that\r\nwould support us and at the same time support our political activities.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Could I characterize it this way--that a\r\nmaterial objective of this group or partnership was ultimately a\r\nself-interest in business?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Coupled with a political arm which was to aid or assist in\r\nthe business, and each was to feed the other?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The business arm was to be developed mainly to feed the\r\npolitical arm.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We were mainly interested in the political end. At least\r\nthis is my feeling on it. Mainly interested in the political end. And\r\nthe business end, while, of course, we hoped it would succeed, in my\r\nmind was merely to support us politically.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, as of this moment, Mr. Weissman, there\r\nwere the five of you only. There were no others who were part of the\r\ncombination business-political group?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We left out one man, one of the original men. His name\r\nwas James Moseley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he a GI with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; he was an American civilian. His father was a\r\nmajor--is a major in the Army.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was he an acquaintance of yours?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Prior to this time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not prior to this. I met him when I went into the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Was he an acquaintance of Mr. Schmidt's?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did he get in, is what I am getting at? How did he get\r\ninto this little group here?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. They all hung around the same bar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What bar?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The Gastatte Lukullus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How far was that from the bar where Hitler used\r\nto gather?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. A couple of miles, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is a bar in Munich?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. It is a GI guest house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This man you have now mentioned, Moseley, was a civilian in\r\nGermany?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He was a civilian; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did he come to be in Munich? Was his father stationed\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. His father was stationed there. But he was also employed\r\nby Rambler--he was selling Ramblers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is Mr. Moseley's hometown?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is Mr. Mosley's hometown?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe it is New York. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How old a man is he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He is a pretty young fellow. He is about 21.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, have you named all of you who were the nucleus of this\r\ngroup?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. To my recollection, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you finished your statement as to the general--the\r\ngeneral statement as to the purpose of this organization which\r\nconsisted of the two arms?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not completely. I think what might bear directly is we\r\nhad planned while in Munich that in order to accomplish our goals, to\r\ntry to do it from scratch would be almost impossible, because it would\r\nbe years before we could even get the funds to develop a powerful\r\norganization. So we had planned to infiltrate various rightwing\r\norganizations and by our own efforts become involved in the hierarchy\r\nof these various organizations and eventually get ourselves elected\r\nor appointed to various higher offices in these organizations, and by\r\ndoing this bring in some of our own people, and eventually take over\r\nthe leadership of these organizations, and at that time having our\r\npeople in these various organizations, we would then, you might say,\r\ncall a conference and have them unite, and while no one knew of the\r\nexistence of CUSA aside from us, we would then bring them all together,\r\nunite them, and arrange to have it called CUSA.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You never accomplished this, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Almost. Here is how far we did get.\r\n\r\nLarrie had--and this was according to plan--the first organization we\r\nplanned to infiltrate was the NIC, National Indignation Convention,\r\nheaded by Frank McGee in Dallas. About a week or so after Larrie got to\r\nDallas he got himself a job with the NIC, as one of the very few paid\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThis didn't last too long, because a few weeks after that the NIC went\r\nunder. And we had also--in other words, we had planned to use these\r\norganizations as vehicles to accomplish----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Keep going on those details of your infiltration.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. All right. We had planned to infiltrate these various\r\nrightwing organizations.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mentioned one.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The NIC. The Young Americans for Freedom. We succeeded\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr JENNER. What organization is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The Young Americans for Freedom? This was an organization\r\nessentially of conservative youths, college students, and if I recall\r\nI think the most they ever accomplished was running around burning\r\nbaskets from Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was it based?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is southwest. Regional headquarters was in Dallas,\r\nTex., Box 2364.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the earlier organization, the organization you\r\nmentioned a moment ago, NIC--where was that based?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. What is the next one?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We had also discussed getting some people in with General\r\nWalker, getting some people into the John Birch Society.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Stick with General Walker for a moment. To what extent were\r\nyou able to infiltrate, as you call it, General Walker's group?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, this was rather a fiasco. Larrie's brother, as I\r\nmentioned in the letter--Larrie's brother went to work for General\r\nWalker.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was his name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know his first name. But Larrie led me to believe\r\nhis brother was some guy. His brother is about 29. And the only\r\nthing I ever heard from Larrie about his brother was good; and when\r\nhe mentioned that his brother had joined the Walker organization, I\r\nfigured this is another step in the right direction. In other words, he\r\nwas solidifying his argument as to why I should come to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this is what he told you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. So when I got to Dallas, I found that Larrie's\r\nbrother drank too much, and he had--well, I considered him a moron. He\r\ndidn't have any sense at all. He was very happy with $35 a week and\r\nroom and board that General Walker was giving him as his chauffeur and\r\ngeneral aide. And so I tossed that out the window that we would never\r\nget into the Walker organization this way.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This man's name, by any chance, was not Volkmar?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This name is entirely unfamiliar to me. Never heard it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Could you identify the Walker organization? You keep\r\nspeaking of the Walker organization.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. General Edwin Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. General Edwin A. Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever meet him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I never have.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How did you infiltrate the Young Americans for\r\nFreedom, and what led you to believe you had been successful?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, Larrie had been named executive secretary of\r\nthe Dallas chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom. And another\r\nman--his name is in one of these letters somewhere--I don't recall it\r\noffhand--who was brought into CUSA by Larrie, was named chairman or\r\nvice chairman--vice chairman. And the only other move that we had to\r\nmake in order to take control of Dallas Young Americans for Freedom\r\nwould have been to get rid of the chairman, who was anti-Larrie\r\nSchmidt. He was absolutely no help to us. And this was on its way to\r\naccomplishment. But for some reason or another, there was some sort of\r\nan argument. I am still not clear on what happened. I wasn't there. I\r\njust can take it secondhand from Larrie.\r\n\r\nA friend of Larrie's had come to Dallas--this was Larry Jones, another\r\npartner in----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He is mentioned in some of these interviews. Did you meet\r\nLarry Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I didn't meet him in Dallas; no. He was gone before I\r\ngot there. But Larry had come to Dallas, he had stayed a few weeks,\r\nhad made friends with these people, and I had advocated many and many\r\na time--I saw through Larry the first time I met him--is to get rid of\r\nthis guy, because he was not going to do us any good.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did meet Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In the Army; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You met Larry Jones in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. We were all on the same post.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, if you will permit, I would like to go back\r\nto that at this moment.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Surely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was another man. You hadn't mentioned him before.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I didn't? I thought I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What rank was he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. SP-4, Specialist-4.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That wasn't the company clerk?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No. Larry worked for headquarters. He was in\r\ncommunications--the scramblers and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Seeking to scramble broadcasts?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No. In other words, they would send out the secret\r\nmessages and so forth from commander to commander and so on.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These were military messages?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How old a man was Larry Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larry--he looked 30. I think he is 21.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have the charter or partnership agreement of CUSA\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I wonder if I could see that.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Sure.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman; the document consists of two pages\r\nwhich have been identified as Commission Exhibit No. 1034. It is\r\nentitled \"Corporate Structure of American Business, Inc.,\" naming as\r\nincorporators or partners, Larrie H. Schmidt, Larry C. Jones, Bernie\r\nWeissman, James L. Moseley, Norman F. Baker. It purports to be signed\r\nin those names as well on the second page.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1034 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I notice on the first page that after each of those names\r\nthere appear to be some initials. Are those the initials of those\r\nrespective men?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And were those initials placed on there in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The signatures that appear under each of those names or\r\nabove each of those names on the second page, those are the signatures\r\nof those men, including your own?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were they placed on there in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, they were.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you want that admitted at this time, Mr. Jenner?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was going to offer these documents in sequence, if it\r\nsuits the convenience of the Chairman. If we may return now, Mr.\r\nWeissman, please, to your efforts to infiltrate various conservative\r\ngroups----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there? I may have to leave in a\r\nfew minutes. Was there any time when your organization drew up a list\r\nof organizations, of other organizations, that it wanted to infiltrate?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have that list with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know. I have lost an awful lot of it. I might.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you look, please?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I don't have it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask, then--can he name from memory the\r\norganizations?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Using your recollection, sir, and it appears to be very\r\ngood, if I may compliment you----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you do your best to respond to Senator Cooper's\r\nquestion by naming those various groups?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. One was the NIC.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you use initials, will you spell out what the initials\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. National Indignation Convention, headed by Frank McGee,\r\nin Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nYoung Americans for Freedom, which encompassed the southwest. The\r\ninitials are YAF.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Located in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Regional headquarters in Dallas. John Birch Society.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was the John Birch--was there a chapter or\r\nheadquarters in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There are several chapters in Dallas; yes. And as far as\r\nI can recollect, that is as far as we went.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What did you hope to accomplish by this\r\ninfiltration, as you call it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I will be very blunt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That is what I would like for you to be.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We were, you might say--at least I personally--this is\r\nmy reason--I was sick and tired of seeing America as a weak sister\r\nall the time. And this is especially in the field of foreign affairs,\r\nwhere it seemed that our administration, whether it is the Eisenhower\r\nor the Kennedy administration, both of them, had no set, stable foreign\r\npolicy. We were constantly losing ground all over the world. We were\r\ngoing to conference tables with everything to lose and nothing to gain,\r\nand coming away by losing.\r\n\r\nAnd we hoped by developing a powerful political organization we could\r\nexert some influence on the government and eventually even put, you\r\nmight say, our man in the White House, let's say, in order to obtain a\r\nstable policy--because we felt that the Communists were gaining ground\r\nall over the place, we were doing nothing but losing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you have a candidate for the Presidency?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Excuse me?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you have a candidate--you said your man.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I wouldn't say we had a candidate. We had looked to\r\nBarry Goldwater as personifying Mr. Conservative. And we had stated in\r\nwriting, though, that we would support him for the Presidency, but we\r\nwere not obligated to support him or any other individual.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Are you still in this business?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What are you doing now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am a salesman, I sell carpets.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You have given up this goal?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, if I had money I didn't know what to do with, I\r\nwould get back into it--only I would do it myself, because I found that\r\nin order to accomplish these aims--I mentioned before I considered\r\nmyself an idealist. I found in order to accomplish these goals I had to\r\nagainst my will prostitute my ideals in order to further the general\r\ncause of the organization.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What ideals did you find you had to prostitute?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I personally didn't want to associate with the John Birch\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You did not want to?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Why didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well; they are rather extreme, I thought. I didn't like\r\nsome of the things they were doing. For example, I didn't want to spend\r\nmy days and nights sneaking into bathrooms around the country, pasting\r\nup \"Impeach Earl Warren\" stickers.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Is that what they do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is part of their program. And I can't see any use in\r\nit, frankly. In other words, it is just little things like this. Plus\r\nthe fact that after I got to Dallas, I found that most of the people\r\nwho are professing anti-communism, they were, they were definitely\r\nanti-Communists. But, at the same time, it seemed to me to be nothing\r\nbut a conglomeration of racists, and bigots and so forth.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What do you mean by that--bigots?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. They are anti-everything, it seems.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Are you Jewish?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were they anti-Jewish?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Too many of them, yes. It was requested at one time that\r\nI change my name.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What did you tell them?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Excuse me?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What did you tell them? Did you change your name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, did you find this request unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did, as a matter of fact, I got pretty mad.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. When you were in Germany, did you find sometimes,\r\nparticularly in Munich, as long as you opened this line of replies,\r\nthat some of the Nazi-alleged anticommunism was also associated with\r\ntheir racist policies?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In what vein are you using Nazi?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, of course, you know they exterminated quite\r\na few members of your religion in Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That is a fact; is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I am using Nazi in the normal term of state\r\ndictatorship, with all that it implies. I am sure you have worked on\r\nforeign policy, you understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think you are giving me a little too much credit. But I\r\nthink I can answer your question.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I would like for you to.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At no time did I, and to my knowledge, in Germany, did we\r\nconsider ourselves fascists or Nazis. As a matter of fact, in my every\r\nconversation, and everything I had written----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I didn't ask you whether you had considered\r\nyourself as a fascist----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Or any of my associates, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Or any of your associates. I asked you if in\r\nyour study of events in Germany, having been stationed there, that you\r\ndidn't soon associate, or that you didn't see some association in your\r\nmind of the alleged so-called extreme right with naziism.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No. In fact, I never thought--I thought of the extremists\r\nas superpatriots. I had never really defined the term fascist or Nazi\r\nin my own mind----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Of course, you realize that members of your\r\nreligion in Germany were described as traitors, treasonable, and\r\nCommunists. And I presume that on the other side of the coin those\r\nmaking the accusation classified themselves as superpatriots.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is quite true. But you are getting into a field\r\nright now that at the time----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you surprised when you discovered this\r\nanti-Jewish feeling? You must have been somewhat, shall I say,\r\ndisappointed when one of your associates asked you to change your name.\r\nI would think that was right insulting.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was downright insulting, as a matter of fact. No, I\r\nwasn't surprised. Now----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you have something on this in your letter? I noticed\r\nyou looking through that letter a minute ago. I thought maybe you had\r\nsomething on this very point in your letter.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. I received a letter from Larrie, while I was in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is this another document to which no reference has been\r\nmade?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am not sure whether this is the one I want to read\r\nfrom. But this letter is an answer that I wrote Larrie.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, sir. I want to put an exhibit number on that.\r\n\r\nThis will be exhibit--Commission Exhibit No. 1035.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1035 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I would like for a moment to pursue this a\r\nbit. This gentleman is telling us something that I think is very\r\nsignificant. You have a letter there about changing your name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is my answer. I would like to read just this one\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Who was this addressed to?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was addressed to Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ask you to change your name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. He was your associate?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He didn't ask me directly. He had written a letter to\r\nLarry Jones, and Larry Jones gave me the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was Larry Jones at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are now reading from Commission Exhibit No.----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Exhibit No. 1035. This is dated Munich, Germany, January\r\n7, 1963.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is addressed to whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I take it it is your letter to Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you dispatch the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is that a true and correct copy of the original that\r\nyou did dispatch to Larrie Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Erasures and all; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you become aware of the fact subsequently to your\r\nmailing that letter that he received it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had occasion to discuss it with him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He sent me a letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He responded?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Do you have his response?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know. I have his response. I don't know if it is\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Let's first have what he said.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Paragraph 2 on the second page, \"Larrie, as relates to\r\nthe political goals of CUSA and the methods of achieving them, I (not\r\nalone)\"--meaning Bill Burley--\"do not wholly support your ideas as\r\nconcerning the NIC and related or affiliated organizations. It seems to\r\nus that this type of organization smacks of hypocrisy. I feel that any\r\ntype of organization that we choose to support or begin to take support\r\nfrom should be free from the racism and prejudice in general that\r\nis rampant among the high officers of the NIC. It should be obvious\r\nto you that once we associate ourselves with these people, we may\r\nacquire a personal reputation that can never be lived down. I am sure\r\nyou have considered this yourself, because I remember we had talked\r\nof it several times. Larrie, let me remind you that my zeal has not\r\nslackened, but that I did not want to compromise myself or my ideals\r\nfor the sake of accomplishing our goals a year ahead of time. I know\r\nand you know that we can do a fantastic job once we get together again\r\nwith or without these organizations.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What do you say about your name, though?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About my name?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Yes. Changing your name.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I didn't refer to it directly. In other words, in the\r\nletter I received from Larrie, he said--he mentioned that the NIC, the\r\nleadership, Frank McGee, was anti-Jewish, and it might be best if I\r\nchanged my name in order to bring myself down to where I can associate\r\nwith these people.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you have a copy of that letter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Let me take a look here. With your permission, I would\r\nlike to read into the record a paragraph----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To what are you referring now, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is a letter sent by Larrie Schmidt to Larry Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it is in longhand, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And do you recognize the handwriting?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It is Larrie's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It consists of seven pages, which we will mark Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1036.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1036 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Before you read from the letter, how did you come into\r\npossession of the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larry Jones gave it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Over in Germany?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Over in Germany; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the envelope which I now have in my hand, from which\r\nyou extracted the letter, is postmarked Dallas, Tex., November 5.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What year?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1962. Is that the envelope in which the letter, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1036, was received by Mr. Jones? I notice the letter is\r\naddressed to Mr. Jones, SP-4 Larry Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will mark that as Commission Exhibit No. 1036-A--that\r\nis, the envelope.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1036-A for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. On the third page, last paragraph, he has marked \"One\r\nbad thing, though. Frank gives me the impression of being rather\r\nanti-Semetic. He is Catholic. Suggest Bernie convert to Christianity,\r\nand I mean it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must all return to church. These people here are religious bugs.\r\nAlso no liberal talk whatsoever--none.\" Larrie had a flare for the\r\ndramatic.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When he mentions \"these people\" who does he mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The NIC. And at this point I was ready to drop out of\r\nthe organization completely, but thought better of it, because I am a\r\nperennial optimist. I felt once I got down there--it is like changing\r\nyour wife after you marry her. You figure everything will work out.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This CUSA organization in Munich--did it have any\r\nlocal Munich affiliation at all? I mean German affiliation?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; none whatsoever. Strictly an American proposition.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All among GI's, with the one exception of----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. GI's or, one or two hangers-on, American civilians over\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman?\r\n\r\nYou stated at one point in your testimony that you did not care to\r\nbecome associated with some of the organizations you had discussed. You\r\nnamed the John Birch--you thought it was too extreme. Yet you stated\r\nearlier that it was your intention to infiltrate these organizations.\r\nHow do you explain this inconsistency?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It is difficult to explain. The situation being as fluid\r\nas it was--you find that without anything solid to go on, you have got\r\nto change your stand a little bit in order to just get started.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Let me ask you something else. You said that you all\r\nhad thought that to be able to fully pursue your political objectives,\r\nyou needed to have a certain financial independence, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you intend to get some financial support from these\r\norganizations, in addition to political support?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; not directly. We felt that after we had accomplished\r\nour goal--this is assuming we would accomplish our goal--any treasury\r\nthat they had through membership dues or what-have-you would then be a\r\ncommon treasury, a CUSA treasury.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You had the idea that you could infiltrate and get\r\ncontrol of these organizations, then you would have a source of revenue\r\nthrough their treasury, or through whatever treasury you were able to\r\nbuild up?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you think, also, in terms of contributions to these\r\norganizations from individuals?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It had been discussed--never very completely. It had just\r\nbeen brought up. But we didn't know exactly what we were going to do,\r\nreally.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there any discussion about the support of these\r\norganizations--about the financial support of these organizations,\r\nthat they might be a source of funds?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. You mean from individuals who would contribute?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there any discussions as to what individuals were\r\nsupporting these organizations?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Just those that we had occasionally read about in Life or\r\nLook or Time--people like Hunt, H. L. Hunt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of Dallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Of Dallas, Tex.--the oilman. In other words, people\r\nwho are known to be conservative, sympathized with the conservative\r\nphilosophy. And we didn't know at the time--in fact, I still don't know\r\npersonally whether or not they do contribute. I just know it is said\r\nthey do. But whether they do or not, I have no idea.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. It has been established, I presume, who paid for\r\nthis newspaper advertisement.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, this is something else. I am still not sure of who\r\npaid for it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The newspaper advertisement is Commission Exhibit No. 1031.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you bring the money in to pay for it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you know where you got it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I know where I got it. But I don't know where he got it\r\nfrom. I got it from Joe Grinnan.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Joseph P. Grinnan, Room 811, Wilson Building, Dallas, Tex.,\r\nindependent oil operator in Dallas.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How did you happen to get it from him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, Joe was the volunteer coordinator for the John\r\nBirch Society.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And how did he hand it to you--in a check or cash?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In cash.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How much was it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was a total of $1,462, I believe. We had 10 $100 bills\r\none day, and the balance the following day. Now, as far as I know, Joe\r\ndidn't put any of this money up personally, because I know it took him\r\n2 days to collect it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you think you know where he got it from?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know. I really don't know.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. He didn't tell you where he got it from?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; he didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. But you are convinced in your own mind that it\r\nwasn't his money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; because he seemed to be--he didn't seem to be too\r\nsolvent.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you solicit him for this money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Who did?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe--well, I believe Larrie did. I think the idea\r\nfor the ad originated with Larrie and Joe.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And Larrie solicited the money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I don't think so. I think it was Joe who originally\r\nbroached the subject.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How did you happen to end up with the money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was an expression of confidence, you might say, that\r\nJoe Grinnan had in me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you write the copy?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I helped.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Who else?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. So Joe Grinnan gave you the money, and you and\r\nLarrie wrote the copy?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We wrote the copy before that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And then you paid for it. What was this\r\ncommittee? Are you the chairman of that committee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, this is an ad hoc committee. I think we finally\r\nthought of the name--as a matter of fact, we decided on it the same\r\nmorning I went down to place the original proof of the ad.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What do you mean an ad hoc committee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was formed strictly for the purpose of having a name\r\nto put in the paper.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you have many of these ad hoc committees?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is the only one that I was involved in; that I know\r\nof.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were there others?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you ever ask Joe where this money came from?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; Joe was pretty secretive. I frankly didn't want to\r\nknow. I was interested, but not that interested. And it didn't--it\r\nwould have been a breach of etiquette to start questioning him, it\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Have you ever heard of H. R. Bright, independent\r\noil operator?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you ever hear of Edgar Crissey?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you ever hear of Nelson Bunker Hunt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; that is H. L. Hunt's son. I knew that he had gotten\r\nit from three or four different people, because he told me he had to\r\nget $300 here and $400 there, but he did not say where.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The \"he\" is Mr. Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Grinnan; right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That is all, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you suggest that this advertisement had been drafted\r\nbefore he collected the money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And you used this advertisement as the basis for the\r\ncollection of the money, or was it used for this purpose, as far as you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. As far as I know; yes.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. May I see the ad for a moment? There are a few things I\r\nwould like to point out in this.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give the exhibit number, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It is Exhibit No. 1031.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us the genesis of the advertisement, the black border,\r\nthe context, the text, the part which Mr. Grinnan played, you played,\r\nand Mr. Schmidt played in drafting it, how it came about, what you did,\r\nin your own words. How the idea arose in the first place--and then just\r\ngo forward.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, after the Stevenson incident, it was felt that\r\na demonstration would be entirely out of order, because we didn't\r\nwant anything to happen in the way of physical violence to President\r\nKennedy when he came to Dallas. But we thought that the conservatives\r\nin Dallas--I was told--were a pretty downtrodden lot after that,\r\nbecause they were being oppressed by the local liberals, because of\r\nthe Stevenson incident. We felt we had to do something to build up the\r\nmorale of the conservative element, in Dallas. So we hit upon the idea\r\nof the ad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please tell us who you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Me and Larrie, Larrie and Joe, and then all of us\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. And I originally--well, I took the copy of the ad to the\r\nDallas Morning News.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please, sir--we wanted the genesis from the beginning. How\r\nit came about, who participated in drafting it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About a week or so before placing the ad, Larrie and I\r\ngot together at his house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The ad was placed when?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The first payment was made on the 19th or 20th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this after the announcement of the President's\r\nvisit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You knew that President Kennedy was to be in\r\nDallas on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A week before that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right; we had started working on the ad. Larrie and I\r\ngot together. And I said, \"What are we going to put in it?\"; because\r\nI didn't have the vaguest idea. And Larrie brought out a list of\r\nquestions, 50 questions, that were made up for some conservative--I\r\nthink it might possibly have been one of Goldwater's aides had just\r\nlisted 50 questions of chinks in our foreign policy, you might say,\r\nweak points. And we just picked some that we thought might apply to\r\nPresident Kennedy and his foreign policy. Because the 50 questions went\r\nback quite aways. And all of the questions except for two I had a part\r\nin saying okay to. The two that I had no part in was----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Read them, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Was the 11th question----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are those questions numbered?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; but I will read it to you. It says \"Why has the\r\nforeign policy of the United States degenerated to the point that the\r\nCIA is arranging coups and having stanch anti-Communist allies of the\r\nU.S. bloodily exterminated?\"\r\n\r\nThis was handed in at the last minute by one of the contributors. He\r\nwould not contribute.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I have no idea. But he would not contribute the money.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this one of the men who gave money to Mr. Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; this is my understanding.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did Mr. Grinnan tell you this?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he said \"This has to go in.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He said that to you in the presence of whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe Bill Burley was there, and Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was this?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Joe Grinnan's office.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Dallas; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is room 811 of the Wilson Building?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; and I was against this particular question, because\r\nI frankly agreed with the coup. But it is a question of having all or\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAnother question that was put in here--I forget exactly when--which I\r\nwasn't in favor of, which we put in after the proof was submitted to\r\nJoe Grinnan for his approval, is \"Why have you ordered or permitted\r\nyour brother Bobby, the Attorney General, to go soft on Communists,\r\nfellow travelers, and ultra-leftists in America, while permitting him\r\nto criticize loyal Americans, who criticize you, your administration,\r\nand your leadership?\"\r\n\r\nNow, this struck me as being a States rights plea, and as far as our\r\ndomestic policy goes, I am a pretty liberal guy. So I didn't agree with\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who suggested that question?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't remember. I just remember that it came up--I\r\ndidn't like it. But the fact was that it had to be in there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to keep you on that for a moment. Was it a\r\nsuggestion that had come from a contributor, or did it originate in\r\nyour group?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I really don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or Mr. Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall if it originated with Larrie or Mr.\r\nGrinnan or with someone else. I really don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How old a man is Mr. Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I would say in his very early thirties.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That suggestion, the last one, didn't come from\r\nyou, however?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Which?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The one you just read.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Because of your own liberal domestic philosophy?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. The only question in here that is entirely my own\r\nis the last one, and this is because I was pretty steamed up over the\r\nfiasco in Cuba and the lack of followup by the administration.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you scrapped the Monroe Doctrine in favor of the spirit of\r\nMoscow?\" I will still stand by that question.\r\n\r\nAs far as the copy at the top of the letter, appearing before the\r\nquestions, as far as I know, this was written by Larrie Schmidt. He\r\nshowed it to me. I said, \"It is a little rough, but if we are going to\r\nget our money's worth out of the ad, I guess it has to be.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I stand over near the witness?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Surely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWhen you say the copy at the top of the ad, does that include the\r\nbanner, \"Welcome, Mr. Kennedy, to Dallas.\"?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you are referring to all that portion of the ad which\r\nis Commission Exhibit No. 1031, down to the first question?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. The idea of the black border was mine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. I was going to ask you that. Why did you suggest the\r\nblack border?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I saw a proof of the ad--drew a mockup, the\r\nadvertising man at the newspaper office drew a mockup, and it was the\r\nsort of thing that you just turned the page and pass it by, unless you\r\nhad something to bring it out. And I suggested a black border. He put a\r\none-eighth inch black border around. I said try a little heavier one.\r\nHe went to a quarter inch black border and I said, \"That looks okay,\"\r\nand we had the black border.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it from your present statement that you worked with\r\na copywriter or advertising composer at the Dallas Morning News.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. His name was Dick Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How many editions did this ad run for the $1,463?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. One edition. It came out on the evening edition, on the\r\n21st, and the morning of the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just one paper?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. One edition, one paper.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is only the Dallas Morning News?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was not in the other Dallas papers?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The Times Herald?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No. We felt--we didn't even go to the Times Herald. We\r\nfelt they would not even print it, because they are a very liberal\r\npaper, and we felt it would be a waste of time. We were convinced that\r\nthe Morning News was conservative enough to print it. And they did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So the Dallas Morning News people were quite aware of the\r\ncomposition of the ad, and worked with you in putting it in final shape?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; as a matter of fact, I had asked to show it to a\r\nMr. Gray, who was the head of the advertising department, and they\r\nsaid no, that wouldn't be necessary, they just have to submit it to a\r\njudge something or other, a retired judge who was their legal advisor,\r\nand who would look at the ad to see if there was anything libelous in\r\nit, so to speak, or anything that the Morning News could be sued for.\r\nAnd I assume they did this, because they didn't let me know right away\r\nwhether or not they could print it.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back that afternoon, or the following morning--I don't\r\nrecall which--and they said everything was okay, that it would go.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When you spoke of the head of the advertising department,\r\nthat is the advertising department of the News?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Of the Dallas Morning News; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Weissman, you have read two questions with which you\r\ndisagreed.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have read a question, which is the last in the\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of which you are the author, and you said you would still\r\nstand by that particular one.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. A hundred percent; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, are there any others with which you had a measure of\r\ndisagreement, or any other which you now would not wish to support or,\r\nas you put it, stand back of?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There was one other that I thought was being a little\r\nrough on the President, but which I didn't particularly agree with a\r\nhundred percent.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Identify it, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was in the question that read, \"Why has Gus Hall, head\r\nof the U.S. Communist Party, praised almost every one of your policies\r\nand announced that the party will endorse and support your reelection\r\nin 1964?\r\n\r\nI personally thought that the selection of this particular question\r\ntended to put President Kennedy in a light where he is voluntarily\r\naccepting this support--in other words, sort of calling him a\r\nCommunist, which I felt he was not. And, at the same time, though, I\r\nhad a reservation about making a big furor over it, because of the\r\nfact, if nothing else, if the President did read it, he might realize\r\nsomething, and he just might do something about it, in foresaking the\r\nsupport. So I let it go at that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When you spoke, then, of selection from a list--was that\r\nthe list to which you referred before, which I believe you said came\r\nfrom the Birch Society?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A list of 50 questions.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; as far as I know it didn't come from the Birch\r\nSociety. It was just some political material that Larrie had collected\r\nrafts of--he had books and folders. It was something he pulled out and\r\nsaid, \"Maybe we can use this.\" And we went through the 50 questions. We\r\nwere in a hurry, and this seemed to be the easiest way out, as far as\r\ngetting some text, some composition for the ad.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So the final selection rested with Larrie, Mr.\r\nGrinnan, and yourself, with the exception of this one contributor who\r\ninsisted on one?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, let's put it like this. I signed my name to the ad.\r\nBut you might say the final selection rested with the contributors. I\r\nhad to go along with them, because if I said I won't go along with it,\r\nor I won't sign my name, there would have been an ad anyway--the ad\r\nwould have been printed anyway. Larrie would have put his name to it.\r\n\r\nNow, let me tell you this. It will be a very short story.\r\n\r\nBill and I had decided about a week after we got to Dallas that Larrie\r\nwas full of hooey, that we could not go along with this guy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, everything he is doing he is doing for himself, and\r\nif we happen to fit in, it was fine. And he was getting an awful lot\r\nof recognition and publicity. We felt if this guy got any stronger,\r\nhe would be able to move us out, or control us. So when the idea for\r\nthe ad came up I said, \"Okay, I will put my name to it,\" because I\r\nfelt any recognition that came would then be in my favor, and if we\r\ntook advantage of this, and because these organizations would have to\r\nback me personally as representing them, I could then denounce the\r\nanti-Semitism, the anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, and they would have\r\nto back me up, or else I would just tell the whole story about this\r\nthing. And I felt that this was going to be my move to get back to the\r\noriginal philosophy of a completely democratic type of organization.\r\n\r\nAnd I had discussed--Bill and I, I might say, were a partnership unto\r\nourselves. We had decided one way or the other we were either going to\r\nget out of Dallas or run the thing ourselves, because we didn't like\r\nthe way it was going.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did Larrie object to your being the one to sign the\r\nadvertisement?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; in fact, Larrie was sort of afraid to sign it,\r\nbecause when he came out and said he was part of the Stevenson\r\ndemonstration, his life had been threatened, and he had all sorts of\r\nharrassing phone calls and so on. And he wanted to avoid this. But if\r\nit was a question of printing an ad or not printing it, he would have\r\nsigned it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But as far as any organization of any kind being\r\nresponsible for this ad, it was not true. There was no organization\r\nthat backed this ad? There were four or five of you that really\r\npromoted it and finally raised the money for it and put it in the\r\nnewspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is not quite accurate. You might say when you get\r\nright down to it, in the final tale, the John Birch Society printed\r\nthat ad, not CUSA.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us why, now. Please expand on that.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, in order to get anywhere in Dallas, at least in\r\nthe area of conservative politics that we were in, you had to, you\r\nmight say, cotton to the John Birch Society, because they were a pretty\r\nstrong group, and still are, down there. And----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who is the head of that now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The Birch Society?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I never met the fellow. They had a paid coordinator. I\r\ndon't recall his name offhand. But, anyway----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you in his offices?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; Joe Grinnan, as a matter of fact, is the only man in\r\nthe hierarchy of the Birch Society in Dallas that I met.\r\n\r\nLarrie was a member of the JBS, and Bill and I didn't like it, but we\r\nsaw that he was out for himself as much as anything, and this was a way\r\nto help himself along anyway, both politically and financially. And he\r\nconvinced us of the method to his madness. But as I said we wanted to\r\nmove Larrie out when we found he was more JBS than he was CUSA, and he\r\nwas willing to go along with them completely, and forget about the CUSA\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your allegiance was to CUSA?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. In other words, I would have used the John Birch\r\nSociety as a vehicle, as planned. But I would never have gone up on a\r\nsoapbox to support them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who were the members of the American Fact-Finding\r\nCommittee, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, the members would be myself, Bill Burley, Larrie\r\nSchmidt, Joe Grinnan--just the people immediately involved.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was a name and solely a name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Solely a name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was no such organization?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you used it for convenience on this advertisement?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. As a matter of fact, when I went to place\r\nthe ad, I could not remember the name. I had it written down on a piece\r\nof paper. I had to refer to a piece of paper for the name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you ever used that name before?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did your group ever use it thereafter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you now named all of the people who played any part\r\nin, to the best of your recollection--in the idea for the publication\r\nof, the actual drafting of the ad, and its ultimate running in that\r\nedition of the Dallas Morning News?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There is only one other individual that I could name. He\r\nwas there at the reading of the final proof, before the ad was printed.\r\nThat was Joe Grinnan's brother, Robert P. Grinnan.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is he an older or younger brother?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe he is an older brother.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What business is he engaged in?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Oil and real estate.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who took out the post office box 1792, Dallas 21, Tex.,\r\nthat appears under your name here on this advertisement?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Bill, Larrie, and I went to the post office together. I\r\nsigned for the box.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you recall the date?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was the same--the morning--the same morning I\r\noriginally went to get the ad laid out at the Morning News.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Has it been discontinued?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The box? Yes; I received a communication from Larrie. He\r\nsaid the box time had run out. They had extended it for 3 months after\r\nthat, and then it was--as far as I know, it is nonexistent now.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask this question: Would you state now to this\r\nCommission the idea of printing this ad was conceived by you and Larry\r\nJones--what is the other's name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Alone, and there was no stimulation from any outside\r\ngroup or organization. Do you state that under oath?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There was stimulation.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. From whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I assume from the Birch Society. In other words, I\r\nthink the idea for the ad, for the something to do on the occasion of\r\nPresident Kennedy's visit--I think the idea for the something to do\r\ncame from the Birch Society--whether Mr. Joe Grinnan or someone else, I\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was it communicated as an idea to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie communicated the idea to me, said what do you\r\nthink. I said, why not?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which one of this group did the idea come to?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. It didn't come to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; it didn't come to me personally originally, no.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What is the basis of your evidence of saying this was the\r\nBirch Society? How did you know that? Where did you get that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, it came to a point where everything we were doing\r\nwe had to go talk to Joe--big brother. And that is just the way it\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is Joe Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. They were getting a grip on us, and Bill and I felt\r\nthat we had to bust this grip somehow.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was he prominent in the Birch Society?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he was known.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Joe Grinnan?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he was known as a coordinator.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This one question that was inserted at the\r\ninsistence of one of the contributors, which reads as follows: \"Why has\r\nthe foreign policy of the United States degenerated to the point the\r\nC.I.A. is arranging coups and having staunch anti-Communist allies of\r\nthe U.S. bloodily exterminated\"--to what does that refer? Do you have\r\nany specific information?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I know it specifically refers to the Vietnam thing, with\r\nthe overthrow of Diem, and the subsequent murder of the Diem people.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that said to you at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was not said to me at the time. But I had\r\nmentioned it various times, and this was definitely, as far as I am\r\nconcerned--this was definitely the reason for placing that. As a matter\r\nof fact, this had occurred not too long after that, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was it that insisted on the insertion of that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, Joe Grinnan handed me this piece of paper. It was\r\nwritten on a piece of scrap paper. I could hardly decipher it, myself.\r\nAnd he said, \"This has to be in. Go back and have them change the ad.\"\r\n\r\nSo I had to run back to the Morning News, with this other insertion.\r\nThis is just the way it happened.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I understand that you made a downpayment on the ad.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And then went back and paid the rest in full?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. A thousand dollars the first day, and $400-odd on the\r\nsecond day.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were both payments made before publication?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Dulles called attention to the post office box number.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That stimulates me to ask you this: Did you receive any\r\nresponses to the advertisement?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Oh, did I? Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, tell us about that and also, before you start, do you\r\nhave any of those responses?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not with me. All that I received I have at home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And indicate to us the volume that you have at home.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I have approximately 50 or 60 letters; about one-third\r\nof which were favorable, and the rest, two-thirds, unfavorable. The\r\nfavorable responses, all but one came before--they were postmarked, the\r\nenvelopes were postmarked before the President was assassinated. And\r\nthe threatening letters and the nasty letters came afterward.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive any contributions?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I still have a check to the American Fact-Finding\r\nCommittee in the amount of $20. Since we never opened a bank account,\r\nI just sort of kept the check as a souvenir. There was one $2\r\ncontribution----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Cash?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right--from a retired train engineer, or something.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. For the Wabash Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were those the only contributions?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. To my knowledge; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At least that you know anything about?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. In all the letters I received the first\r\ntime we went to the box. I only went to the box once, that was, I\r\nbelieve, the Sunday morning following the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The 25th of November?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did anybody have the key to the box in addition to yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Up to that point, only I had the key. After that, I left\r\nDallas on Wednesday, I believe----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I misspoke--it was the 24th of November rather than the\r\n25th.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I left Dallas on the following Wednesday. And at that\r\ntime I didn't see Larrie personally--he couldn't get to the apartment\r\nthat Bill and I were staying at for some reason or another. And I left\r\nall the dishes and things he had given us to use while we were there,\r\nand in one of these dishes I left the key to the box.\r\n\r\nSince that time, communications I received from Larrie, he says\r\nthe tenor of the letters had changed, they are more favorable than\r\nunfavorable in the ensuing weeks and months. Of these letters--he\r\nsent me one that called me all sorts of names, a lot of anti-Semitic\r\nremarks, and he sent another, and he gave excerpts in one of his\r\npersonal letters, of letters that he received in support of the\r\nposition of the ad.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do I understand that you got all the letters that came in\r\nup to Wednesday after the assassination, and that your associates have\r\nthe rest, or Larrie, I presume, has the rest?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know who has the rest. I don't know if it is\r\nLarrie or Joe.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Larrie had the key.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. I left him the key--I left him access to the\r\nkey. I received the letters written during the 2 days following\r\nthe assassination--the Friday afternoon and Saturday following the\r\nassassination--because I picked the mail up the following Sunday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Having in mind all your testimony up to the moment, I would\r\nlike to take you back to the telephone conversation that you had with\r\nLarrie Schmidt, in which he made the reference to Stevenson, following\r\nwhich, that is following this conversation, you eventually came to\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this conversation, as I recall it, the telephone call,\r\nwas in the month of October 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. It was the evening of the Stevenson demonstration.\r\nAccording to the letter I think it was the 24th of October.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, one of the members of the Commission is interested\r\nin having you repeat that conversation in full, to the best of your\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Since it is recollection, it is going to change somewhat\r\nin words, but in tenor it will be the same.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do your best.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie called me on the telephone and he was very\r\nexcited, and he had described what had transpired in Dallas----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us what he said, please. That is what we are\r\ninterested in.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He just said----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And his part in it, if any.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He said that he had helped organize this demonstration\r\nand it went off beautifully, there is going to be national publicity,\r\nthe newspapers were all over the place, he had given statements to the\r\nnews media, to the television. He said he was on TV and radio, and had\r\ngiven out statements, and that he was--it seemed that he was going to\r\nbe heading for, not trouble, but a good deal of difficulty because it\r\nseems that he was the only one that came out as one of the organizers\r\nof the demonstration, who openly came out and said so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And identified himself with the demonstration?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir. He said he had--what did he say--something to\r\nthe effect that he had a bunch of his people down there, the University\r\nof Dallas students.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he identify them as students?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall. I met the students several weeks later\r\nwhen I got to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The students he had employed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That had participated in the demonstration; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he describe what the demonstration was insofar as his\r\npart and his group's part in it was?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles reentered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, just to the effect they had picketed and carried\r\nsigns and made some noises inside the auditorium. Not he and his\r\ngroup, but that the picketers had raised quite a hullabaloo inside the\r\nauditorium.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were they his picketers?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know. This he didn't specify. I had assumed----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What impression did you get in that respect?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I had assumed his picketers were part of it.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were repeating to the best of your recollection that\r\ntelephone conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The gist of the conversation; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As best you are able to recall.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. I really cannot swear to its 100 percent\r\naccuracy, but I would say it is 75 percent accurate anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you now exhausted your recollection as to all that was\r\nsaid, in substance?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In substance; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the course of that conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it he urged you to come to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That this Stevenson incident had stimulated things to\r\nthe point that CUSA--you members of CUSA should come to Dallas, and\r\neverything was ripe?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He said we can pick up the ball and start running.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you and Mr. Burley then went to Dallas, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. We left on the 2d of November.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that would have been following the receipt of the\r\nletter of October 29, which we have identified as----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 1032.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you get there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I drove in my car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Mr. Burley accompany you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you stop off anywhere on the way?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We stopped at his mother's house in South Carolina for\r\nabout 4 or 5 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And when you reached Dallas, did you find a room, or what\r\ndid you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That night we stayed at Larrie's house. We got there\r\nabout 5 o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where does he live?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At that time he was living at the Eden Roc Apartments, in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is he a married man?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it he was separated from his wife at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No, no. He has been divorced since.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But he was living with his wife at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By the way, is Mr. Burley a married man, also?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I spoke with him just the other day. His divorce will be\r\nfinal in about 6 weeks, he thinks.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was married at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; separated.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was his wife living?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In West Virginia, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He had a family, did he not, several children?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Four or five children.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You stayed with him at the Eden Roc Apartments?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is, with Mr. Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And then you and Mr. Burley arranged a room somewhere, did\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We rented an apartment. I think we stayed with Larrie for\r\n2 days, 2 or 3 days. Then we rented an apartment in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall the address offhand.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, approximately where are we now, as a matter\r\nof time in this period?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That you rented the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About the middle of the first week after we arrived in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which should be approximately what date?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About the 7th or so of November.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you do thereafter in the way of furthering the\r\nbusiness of CUSA?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, we were thinking of buying a fourplex, a\r\nfour-family apartment house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where were you going to get the money?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We could have gotten a loan, we hoped, with no\r\ndownpayment, because of the fact we are GI's, through the FHA, or VA,\r\nand we were counting on that. So we were looking around. We had also\r\nplanned to take over a private club, manage a private club, with an\r\noption to buy it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What club was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That was the Ducharme Club.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Dallas; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where did you become acquainted with that possible business\r\nopportunity?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, this had been broached by Larrie. This was one of\r\nthe big disappointments. We had been promised by Larrie we wouldn't\r\nhave any trouble making a living, that he had jobs and everything set\r\nup for us. That is one of the reasons I chucked my job in New York. I\r\nfigured we would be able to survive down there.\r\n\r\nWe got to the Ducharme Club, after a day or two, and it was a miserable\r\nhole in the wall that you could not really do anything with. But we\r\nwere still dickering with the owner on the potentials.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What did this club purport to do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was a private club. They sold liquor and beer over the\r\nbar to members.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Entertainment?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. They had a dance floor and jukebox.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who--do you recall the names of any of the people\r\ninterested in the Ducharme Club?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The owners?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The only one I know of is Leon Ducharme, the owner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Jack Ruby or Jack Rubenstein have any interest in this\r\nclub?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; not as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever meet Jack Ruby or Jack Rubenstein?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you become acquainted with the Carousel Club when you\r\nwere in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I was never in it, and I still don't know where it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were never in it; you don't know where it is. Did you\r\nhear of it when you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never. As a matter of fact, in the entire 3-1/2 weeks or\r\nso that Bill and I were in Dallas, we didn't go to the movies at all.\r\nThe only two clubs that I can recall that we went into was the Lavender\r\nLounge----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where is that located?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall the street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is downtown, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; it is not downtown. This is--it was about two blocks\r\nfrom our apartment. And it is about, I guess, a good 30-minute walk to\r\ndowntown from there. And the only other club would be the Ducharme Club.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was that located?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That was on Haskell Avenue, in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How far from the downtown area, if at all?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, to make it conveniently, you should take a bus.\r\nOtherwise, about a 20-minute walk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From the Ducharme Club to the downtown area of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir; and the reason we went to the Ducharme Club\r\nafter the fact we decided we were not going to take it, was that that\r\nwas a place we could get credit for beer. Larrie had a charge account\r\nthere. And that was the extent of our association with that place.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Now, in the Lavender Lounge, the reason we went there, is\r\nwe were dickering with the owners of the Lavender Lounge----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Name him.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. L. S. Brotherton. We wanted to lease a club that he had\r\nthat was closed down, called the Beachcomber, in a suburb of Dallas.\r\nAnd we had been in there several times and had talked to him about\r\nleasing this. In other words, we were looking for something that would\r\ngive us an income so we could operate a little bit. And that never\r\nworked out. He wanted too much money, and we didn't have it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In any of these negotiations that were carried on by you or\r\nyour associates, was the name Jack Ruby ever mentioned as having any\r\npossible interest whatsoever in any of those groups?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear of the name Jack Ruby or Jack Rubenstein up\r\nto--at anytime prior to November 24, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And do you have any information or any knowledge or any\r\nnotion or feeling that Larrie Schmidt or any of your associates knew\r\nof or had any association with Jack Ruby or otherwise known as Jack\r\nRubenstein?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think I can state pretty emphatically no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were there any communications of any kind or character,\r\nwritten notes, telephone calls, or otherwise, that you know about or\r\nknew about then to or from Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first hear of the name Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think he shot Oswald some time in the afternoon\r\nor the morning--since Bill and I had neither a radio or TV in the\r\napartment--we were in the apartment all day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All day that Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; we had heard about it that night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is the 24th of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. If that is when Oswald was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you first became aware of Oswald being shot the night\r\nor evening of the 24th?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. I don't recall exactly how. I think Larrie\r\ntelephoned us, and told us that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is the first time we have mentioned the name Oswald.\r\nHad you ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald prior to your going to\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear of the name Lee Harvey Oswald at any time\r\nprior to November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was the name ever mentioned in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it from what you have said that you did not know a\r\nman by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first hear the name Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We were sitting in a bar, right after President Kennedy's\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was the 22d of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was Bill Burley, myself, and Larrie. We had\r\nmade--we were to meet Larrie and Joe Grinnan at the Ducharme Club.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For what meal?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. For luncheon. We were supposed to meet him at 12:30 or\r\n1 o'clock, I forget which--about 1 o'clock. And I had a 12:30 on the\r\nbutton, as a matter of fact--I had an appointment to sell a carpet out\r\nin the Garland section of Texas--it was a 2:30 appointment. And I was\r\nin a hurry to get to meet Larrie and finish the lunch, and whatever\r\nbusiness they wanted to talk about I didn't know. So I looked at my\r\nwatch. I remember specifically it was 12:30, because at that time\r\nBill had been driving my car. He had quit the carpet company and was\r\nlooking for another job. He had looked at a franchise arrangement for\r\ninsecticides. He picked me up. He was waiting for me from 10 after 12\r\nto 12:30. We got into the car. I am a great news bug. So I turned the\r\nradio on, looking for a news station. And they had--at that time, as I\r\nturned the radio on, the announcer said, \"There has been a rumor that\r\nPresident Kennedy has been shot.\" So we didn't believe it. It was just\r\na little too far out to believe.\r\n\r\nAnd after several minutes, it began to take on some substance about\r\nthe President's sedan speeding away, somebody hearing shots and\r\npeople laying on the ground. In other words, the way the reporters\r\nwere covering it. I don't recall exactly what they said. And, at this\r\ntime--we were going to go to the Ducharme Club through downtown Dallas.\r\nWe were heading for the area about two blocks adjacent to the Houston\r\nStreet viaduct. And then we heard about the police pulling all sorts of\r\npeople--somebody said they saw somebody and gave a description. And the\r\npolice were pulling people off the street and so forth. So Bill and I\r\ndidn't want to get involved in this. So we took a roundabout route. We\r\ngot lost for a while. Anyway, we finally wound up at the other side of\r\nDallas, and we were at the Ducharme Club.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you arrived there, was Mr. Schmidt there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He was waiting for me. But Joe Grinnan wasn't there.\r\nHe had heard this thing and took off. I guess he wanted to hide or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, because the way it was right away, the announcers,\r\neven before it was ascertained that President Kennedy was dead, or that\r\nhe had really been shot, that it was a rightwing plot and so forth. And\r\nhe had every reason to be frightened.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why did he have every reason to be frightened?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Because, let's face it, the public feeling would suddenly\r\nbe very antirightwing, and no telling what would happen if a mob got\r\ntogether and discovered him. They would tear him apart.\r\n\r\nBill and I were frightened to the point because I knew about the\r\nad. And I knew exactly what--at least I felt in my own mind I knew\r\nwhat people would believe. They would read the ad and so forth, and\r\nassociate you with this thing, somehow, one way or another. So we went\r\nto another bar--I don't remember the name of it--the Ducharme Club was\r\nclosed, by the way, that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you reached the Ducharme Club, it was closed, but you\r\nfound Mr. Schmidt there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie was waiting on the corner. He got in the car. We\r\nsat and talked for a few minutes. We went to another bar a few blocks\r\naway. We drank beer and watched television. And we had been in the bar,\r\nI guess, about an hour when it come over that this patrolman Tippit had\r\nbeen shot, and they trapped some guy in a movie theater. And maybe half\r\nan hour, an hour later, it came out this fellow's name was Lee Harvey\r\nOswald. This is the first time I ever heard the name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was said at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. By us?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. When it was announced it was Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We were relieved.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anything said about it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall. First, what was said, like, I hope he is\r\nnot a member of the Walker group--something like that--I hope he is\r\nnot one of Walker's boys. Because it is like a clique, and it is guilt\r\nby association from thereafter. So it came over later this guy was a\r\nMarxist. This was the same afternoon, I believe. It was found out this\r\nfellow was a Marxist. And then the announcers--they left the rightwing\r\nfor a little while, and started going to the left, and I breathed a\r\nsigh of relief. After 4 hours in the bar, Bill and I went back to the\r\napartment, and Larrie went to the Ducharme Club. He was afraid to go\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I thought the Ducharme Club was closed.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was open at that time. We drove by. It was open.\r\nLarrie went in. We dropped him off there. And Bill and I went back to\r\nour apartment. We just waited. We knew we were going to get involved in\r\nthis thing because of the ad. And we figured that if anybody at all in\r\nDallas was on the ball, they know who we were and where we were. So we\r\nwaited. Nothing happened. We waited there until we left. We barely left\r\nthat house. As a matter of fact----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You remained in the house all that evening, did you--the\r\napartment?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think the--yes; late that evening Larrie came home.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is Friday evening, November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I think Larrie went home late that evening, and Bill\r\nand I met him there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You went to Larrie's home?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. To Larrie's apartment; yes. And I said what are we going\r\nto do? And Larrie said, \"Well\"--he had talked to Joe Grinnan, and Joe\r\nsaid don't say anything, don't do anything, don't get any more involved\r\nthan you have to, lay low, keep out of it, it is going to be pretty\r\nbad. And it was. Thereafter, a day or so later--\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you mean by that--it is going to be pretty bad?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In other words--this is just exactly the way it worked\r\nout. For example----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are now explaining what you mean by \"and it was\"?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right. Stanley Marcus, who was a Dallas businessman,\r\nfinancier----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Nieman Marcus?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Of the Nieman Marcus group, yes, and he was a well-known\r\nand rather very rabid liberal. And sure enough, even though the\r\nfollowing day it was then established that Oswald was a Marxist and\r\nso forth, and there was some question as to whether or not it was a\r\nCommunist plot, pros and cons, and Marcus put his 2 cents in in the\r\nDallas Times Herald, and he starts blaming the rightwing for the\r\ntrouble. And I was told--I didn't see this----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was on the 23d now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was on the following day; yes, sir. And, in other\r\nwords, he and friends of his, I guess, did everything they could\r\nto solidify their position as being always in the right, and throw\r\nthe blame, even though Oswald is obviously a Marxist--they tried to\r\ntransfer the blame to the rightwing. They had us on the run and they\r\nwere going to keep it that way.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did this come to your attention?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Just by reading the newspapers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. There was very little in the Morning News about the\r\nrightwing, that was antirightwing, and the Dallas Times Herald was full\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please delineate what you mean by \"us\" who were\r\non the run?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I mean any conservative in Dallas at that time was\r\nkeeping quiet.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Including yourself and the other men you mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Including myself and everybody I was associated with;\r\nyes, sir. And a day or so after that, I think it was Sunday or Monday,\r\nI had suggested to Larrie, and I spoke to Joe Grinnan on the phone,\r\nthat maybe I should call the FBI and give them the story on this ad.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Now, look, if they want you, they will find you. They\r\nknow where you are, probably. So if they want you, they will find you.\"\r\nSo I waited. And several times I was going to make that phone call, and\r\nI did not. Then finally we just ran out of money.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are probably a few days beyond the 23d now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right; I am. I am going now--everything was rather\r\nstable, static up until the Wednesday, the following Wednesday, when I\r\nleft Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I want to complete your whole day of the 23d before you\r\nmove beyond that. Did you or Bill leave your apartment on the 23d?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; we were over at Larrie's house. I don't remember\r\nexactly the times. We had been to Larrie's place several times.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you in the Dallas downtown business district at\r\nanytime on the 23d?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't think so--no--no, as a matter of fact. In fact, I\r\ndidn't get around to the business district until--yes. We went into the\r\nouter edge of the downtown area to get to the post office, to pick up\r\nthe letters.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is right. On the 23d you went to the post office box\r\nand picked up the 60-odd letters that you have at home in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right. And then we went directly back to the\r\napartment, and opened these letters.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is all you did in the downtown area?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; so far as I can recollect.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Approximately what time of the day was that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That was in the morning. That was early in the\r\nmorning--about 8 or 9 o'clock, I guess, in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive any telephone calls at your apartment that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I received--Larrie called us, I know. I don't recall what\r\nwas said. It was just like, \"What is happening--everything okay?\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday I received a letter----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. Have we now accounted from the time you got up\r\nSaturday morning until the time you went to bed that evening?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't recall. Bill and I might have gone out for a\r\nhamburger a couple of blocks away. We didn't go anywhere near downtown.\r\nWe might have gone to Larrie's apartment that night. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The 22d--we picked you up in your car with Mr. Burley\r\naround 12:30. Now, what happened that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That morning?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes--the 22d. Where were you the morning of the 22d, up to\r\n12:30 o'clock in the afternoon?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Let's see. I left the apartment at about--I guess it was\r\na little after 9. We had a 10 or 10:30 sales meeting scheduled, or\r\n9:30. Anyway, I got there on time for the sales meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was the carpet company by which you were employed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Name it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Carpet Engineers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you had obtained that job when?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About a week after arriving in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was located where?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. 1002 South Beckley, in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the Oak Cliff section?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. On Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was the address?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. 1002. I know what you are getting at. Oswald also had a\r\nroom on Beckley, but he was on the opposite extreme. I think he was on\r\nNorth Beckley. I was on South Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give us the distance approximately between the location\r\nof the carpet company by which you were employed which is on South\r\nBeckley, and Oswald's address on North Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At least a few miles. I don't know. I had never been on\r\nNorth Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At no time while you were in Dallas were you ever on North\r\nBeckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not as far as I know, unless I got lost and didn't know\r\nwhere I was. But as far as I know, I have never been there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were a salesman of carpeting?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever sell any carpeting?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not a one.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make any effort?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I made a lot of effort. This is where most of my money\r\nwent--for gas and things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your associate, Mr. Burley, was he a salesman for this\r\ncompany also?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He quit about 2 weeks--about several days before the 22d.\r\nAnd he was looking--of course, one of us had to make money. We both\r\nwere blanking out with the carpets.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it, however, he had been employed by the same carpet\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You made application together, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were both employed at approximately the same time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But he left the carpet company before you did?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I understand you attended a sales meeting at the carpet\r\ncompany the morning of the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did that sales meeting break up?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. 12:30 for me. It was still going when I left. I left at\r\n12:30 because I had this afternoon appointment, and also this meeting\r\nwith Larrie. I had talked to the sales manager after that. I had----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was his name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Frank Demaria. And I had asked him if he had been\r\nquestioned at all by the FBI. He said yes, they had been around. And I\r\nsaid, \"What did you tell them?\" And he mentioned at that time, he says,\r\n\"We thought you had left about 12 o'clock.\" And I said, \"What are you\r\ntrying to do?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, anyway, this is the way it went. But I know I left at 12:30. They\r\nwere embroiled in a big discussion, and they were not cognizant of the\r\ntime. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, would you tell us what you did on the 24th?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Went to pick up the mail in the morning, went back to the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You picked up mail in the morning on Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right, the post office was open Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You went to the post office on the 23d, which is Saturday,\r\nand you also returned----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I didn't go to the post office on Saturday the 23d.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I misunderstood you, then.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I am almost positive it was Sunday morning. I know it\r\nwasn't Saturday. I am positive--almost positive it was Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is when you picked up the 50-odd letters you referred\r\nto?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was the day that you heard that Ruby had shot Oswald,\r\nwas it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am getting a little confused now. I think I might be 1\r\nday----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. See if we can orient you. The assassination of the\r\nPresident occurred on the 22d of November 1963, which is a Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then there was Saturday. Then on Sunday the 24th occurred\r\nthe shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, with those events in mind, when did you go to the post\r\noffice box?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, now, I know it was not Monday. Now, I am back in\r\nperspective. I am almost definitely sure it was Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You said earlier that it was Saturday. You said it was the\r\nday after the ad appeared, that night, and you went the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; couldn't have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was an error?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That was an error; yes. It was Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, on further reflection, your recollection is\r\nreasonably firm now that you did go to the post office box on Sunday\r\nrather than Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am almost positive it was Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are equally positive it was not Monday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It might either be--I remembered there was an awful lot\r\nof traffic. And I don't know if the traffic was because everybody was\r\ndriving through downtown to go around the Houston viaduct to see the\r\nscene of the assassination or what. And this is what is confusing me\r\nnow. That is why I am not sure if it was Sunday morning--it might have\r\nbeen Monday morning. I doubt it. But it might have been.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it was early?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Around 8 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Eight, nine o'clock; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was asking you to account for your comings and goings and\r\nyour whereabouts on Sunday the 24th. And in the course of doing that,\r\nin referring to the morning, you mentioned that you had gone to the\r\npost office box. Now, what did you do thereafter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Went right back to the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Mr. Burley accompany you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; and another fellow. Ken--Kenneth Glazbrook.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who is he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is a fellow associated with CUSA, but never really.\r\nHe came in, as a matter of fact--yes; I had forgotten about him.\r\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated on a Friday. Ken Glazbrook arrived\r\nin town by bus on Friday night. We went down to the bus station to pick\r\nhim up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You knew he was coming?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes. He----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please identify him.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Ken Glazbrook.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; who was he?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Ken is what you might call a world traveler. This is a\r\nguy--he is a political science--he has a masters in political science\r\nfrom UCLA, I believe. And we had hoped to bring him in as our political\r\nanalyst.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you met him in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Germany; yes. Larrie met him at one time originally.\r\nKen was passing through Munich, and he had stopped off at our favorite\r\nbar, and gotten into a discussion with Larrie. And he had been through\r\nMunich after that two or three times, at one occasion which I met him.\r\nAnd he had also said, \"I will meet you in Dallas.\"\r\n\r\nBut he came and he went. He stayed with Bill and I for a couple of days\r\nat our apartment, because he was on his way home to California. From\r\nwhat I understand now, he is back in Europe. He could not take it here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am still accounting for Sunday. You went to the post\r\noffice box, you think. You went to the bus station to pick up----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am not sure whether this was--I am pretty sure it was\r\nFriday night we picked him up at the bus station. It might have been\r\nSaturday night. But I am more sure in my mind--my inclination goes more\r\ntoward Friday night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You saw him on Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Ken?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see this man on Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He was in the apartment with us.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He came to stay with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he brought a pitcher and a knapsack.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he go down to the post office box with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he returned to your apartment?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. We went through the letters. We were going pro and con,\r\nand reading them. We were very pleased at first because a lot of it\r\nwas favorable, and then we got to the later postmarks, and those were\r\nterrible. We just discussed the letters for a while. And a girl came\r\nover. What was her name? Lynn something--I don't know her last name.\r\nAnd she sat around and talked for a while. We discussed the letters\r\nwith her. Then Larrie came over that afternoon also. He was wearing a\r\nturtle-neck sweater. And we stayed around for a few hours. Then Larrie\r\nand Lynn took off to the Ducharme Club. And thereafter I don't know\r\nwhat happened to them. I did not hear from them at all. And--that is\r\nabout it for Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first hear about the Ruby-Oswald incident?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think Larrie called me up. Yes, he was watching\r\ntelevision at the Ducharme Club, I believe. I believe this was the\r\noccasion. I think he was with Lynn. And he telephoned me at the\r\napartment. And that was the story.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have testified you were never in the Carousel Club.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What if any acquaintance did you have with Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What if any acquaintance did any of your associates have to\r\nyour knowledge with Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Absolutely none.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you ever heard of the name Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to or any time during the day of November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None at all. The first I ever heard of this name was\r\nafter Oswald shot him, and it came over the TV, that a policeman had\r\nbeen shot near a movie theater. That was the first I had heard that\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know whether any of your associates, Schmidt or\r\nBurley or Jones, or any persons you have mentioned, knew Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. To the best of my knowledge, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did anything occur during all the time you were in Dallas\r\nto lead you to believe any of these people, including Mr. Grinnan, for\r\nexample, had had any connection with or association or knowledge of or\r\nacquaintance with Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not as far as I know. I don't know too much about Joe\r\nGrinnan.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you at anytime while you were in Dallas ever have a\r\nmeeting with or sit in the Carousel Club with Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know or do you have any information as to whether\r\nany of the associates you have mentioned ever had a meeting with\r\nOfficer Tippit in the Carousel Club?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or whether or not, irrespective of whether it was a formal\r\nmeeting or even an informal one, that they were with Officer Tippit at\r\nanytime in the Carousel Club.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Absolutely not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were never in the Carousel Club at all; and you\r\nnever were with Officer Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any place.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Any place.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Weissman, it has been asserted that a meeting took\r\nplace on November 14, 1963, in the Carousel Club between Officer Tippit\r\nand yourself--and I take it from your testimony that you vigorously\r\ndeny that that ever took place.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Very definitely. May I say something in relation to this?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it pertinent to this?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe so. I believe that this is a statement made\r\nby Mark Lane, who claimed to be attorney for the deceased Oswald. It\r\nwas originally made at the Town Hall in New York, and later that same\r\nevening, I do not recall the date exactly, on a radio program Contact\r\nWINS New York, at about midnight of that same day.\r\n\r\nAt that time I telephoned the radio station and spoke to Mark Lane.\r\nThis is the first I had heard of the allegation at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You telephoned the radio station?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you asked for Mr. Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did the man for whom you asked come to the phone?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you known Mr. Lane prior to this time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never heard of him before.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had never spoken to him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ask--when there was an answer on the phone, did you\r\nask who it was that was on the phone?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I said something to the effect of \"Hello, Mr. Lane?\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did the voice on the other end of the phone say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He said yes--yes something.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you identify yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you identify yourself before or after you asked whether\r\nthe voice was that of Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I identified myself--I called the radio station and it\r\nwas a telephone thing that was broadcast over the air, question and\r\nanswer--you telephone in a question and he answers. So I telephoned,\r\nand just by luck I happened to get through on the first ring. And\r\nsomebody said, \"Who is calling?\" I said, \"I would like to speak with\r\nMr. Lane. This is Bernard Weissman calling, chairman of the American\r\nFact-Finding Committee.\" And so I got him on the phone, because they\r\ncould not pass this up. And I told him, I identified him that \"You are\r\nthe attorney for the assassin Oswald\"--this is just what I said to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. And he said--he murmured in agreement. He did not say\r\nemphatically \"Yes; I am.\" But he said, \"Um-hum,\" something to that\r\neffect. And I said, \"I know what you are trying to do. I think you are\r\nhunting for headlines. But you had been talking to some liar in Dallas\r\nwho has been feeding you all this baloney about me. You are making all\r\nthese allegations at the Town Hall and now on radio. And you have never\r\ntaken the trouble to contact me. My name has been in the paper. It is\r\nvery well known where I live. I am in the phone book. You could have\r\nat least tried to contact me.\" And I pinned him up against the wall\r\nverbally. And he agreed at that time----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He said that he had no definite proof, that he would have\r\nto check on it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Proof of what?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Proof of the allegations.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you mention what the allegation was when you talked\r\nwith him on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I said, \"You are alleging that I had a meeting with\r\nPatrolman Tippit in Jack Ruby's bar with some unidentified third person\r\nabout a week before the assassination.\" I said, \"You are going strictly\r\non the story of some liar in Dallas.\" I said, \"If you had any courage\r\nor commonsense or really wanted to get at the facts, you would have\r\ncalled and asked me, too.\" And he agreed, yes, he should have talked to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say yes he should have talked to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; and that he would also recheck his facts in Dallas.\r\nAnd that ended the essence of the conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you exhausted your recollection as to that\r\nconversation?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. As to that particular conversation; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you adverted to his assertion in the Town Hall\r\nmeeting, that you had been present in the Carousel Club in a meeting\r\nwith Officer Tippit, did you say that you denied that you were ever in\r\nthe Carousel Club?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I denied that; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was what you said.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I said, \"I did not know Lee Harvey Oswald. I did not know\r\nJack Ruby. I have never been in the Carousel Club.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you said that to him over the telephone on that\r\noccasion----\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was his response to that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This is when he came up with he would have to recheck\r\nhis facts and he would have to check into it. Subsequently, I had\r\ntalked to him later that same evening--the show went off at 1 a.m. in\r\nthe morning. And I had been given a private number to call at the radio\r\nstation. I talked to him on the telephone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you get that number?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. The announcer gave it over the air. And he said, \"If you\r\nwant to speak with Mr. Lane\"--because I was getting pretty hot.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mean angry?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Angry; yes. And he said, \"If you want to talk to Mr. Lane\r\ncall him after the show is over, about 5 after 1.\" I forget the number\r\nof the station. And I telephoned him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You called the same number again.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You asked for Mr. Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And somebody responded?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Mr. Lane got on the wire.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it the same voice?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say in the way of acknowledging that it was Mr.\r\nLane?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I went into it again.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you say, \"Mr. Lane\"?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the voice's response was what?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I said, \"Hello, Mr. Lane.\" And he said--I said, \"Hello,\r\nMr. Lane.\" And he said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Bernie Weissman\" or Mr. Weissman. And he said \"Yes.\" And\r\nthen I reiterated what I had said, and that he had better check his\r\nfacts--and \"I am going to get a hold of some friends in Dallas to check\r\non your witness and find out who he is.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please identify these people.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I was saying this to Mark Lane. And Mark Lane repeated\r\nagain----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please say again what you said to Mr. Lane, and then what\r\nhis response was, because with the rapidity with which you speak, it is\r\ndifficult to sort out his words from your words.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It might be well if you started over again. You called the\r\nstation. You asked for Mr. Lane and a voice responded.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You then said, \"Mark Lane\"? And he responded?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, carry on from there.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I told him that he had better check his facts, that he is\r\noff on a tangent, that there is absolutely no factual background.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For what?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. For him saying, his allegations, that I had had this\r\nmeeting with Tippit in Ruby's bar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you repeat that again? Did you repeat again that you\r\nhad not been in the Carousel Club at anytime?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I don't know if I repeated it at that time. I just made\r\na point of saying that he had better check his facts and talk with me\r\nalso, and get both sides of the story here, before he got himself in\r\ntrouble. By trouble, I had assumed he knew what I meant--I meant a\r\nlawsuit. And I would have sued him, but I could not find a lawyer to\r\nhandle the case. They said any publicity that comes out of it would be\r\nonly bad. So I dropped it. Several days later----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you finished the conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I have finished the conversation with him. Several days\r\nlater I got ahold of his office number.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you fix the time of this Town Hall meeting broadcast,\r\nas best you can.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am pretty sure it was on the 28th or the morning of the\r\n29th--on the Town Hall thing? That was the afternoon of the 28th of\r\nApril, I believe. I believe it was April. It was prior to his coming\r\nto a hearing here at the Commission. And in any case, I telephoned him\r\nseveral days after our radio and telephone conversation--I telephoned\r\nhim at his office in Manhattan and got him on the line again. And I\r\nsaid, \"Well, what has happened?\" I was very curious as to what he had\r\ndone about this.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where did you reach him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. At his office in Manhattan. I do not know the address. I\r\nhad first contacted a law firm he was associated with previously, and\r\nthey gave me his office number in lower Manhattan. And I telephoned him\r\nat his office. The secretary answered, then he got on the line. And he\r\nsaid this time--I don't recall exactly what was said before or after\r\nthis particular part of the conversation. But I said that I want to\r\nmeet this guy in Dallas, the one who told him this story and call him\r\na liar to his face, and that I wanted it to be a public meeting, and\r\nMark Lane said he would arrange for a public meeting, he would pay my\r\ntransportation to Dallas to see this guy as soon as he could arrange a\r\nmeeting. And I have not heard from him since.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To check that date you gave us again. Mr. Weissman--Mr.\r\nLane appeared before the Commission on Wednesday, March 4, 1964.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. March 4? March? I did not think it was that long ago. If\r\nhe appeared March 4, then the conversation--well, I stand corrected. I\r\nam not positive of the month.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It might have been February 28?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It might have been. If it was March 4 he appeared here,\r\nit might have been February 28, because there seemed to be several\r\nweeks lapse between his coming here----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you certain, however, that your telephone conversation\r\nwith him the evening of the broadcast following the Town Hall meeting\r\nwas before he appeared before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Unless he appeared twice, I am a 100 percent positive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And from what source did your information come that he had\r\nappeared before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Newspapers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I think we can close this. I show you Garner Exhibit No. 1.\r\nDid you ever see the person who is shown on that photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 520 and direct your\r\nattention to the man in the white tee shirt between the two policemen.\r\nDid you ever see him before?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Prior to November 22, 1963, had you ever seen him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And except for these photographs, and whatever newspaper\r\nclippings or photos you have seen since November 22, or television\r\nshows on or after November 22, have you ever seen that person in the\r\nflesh?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever have any contact with him of any kind?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Telephone calls, letters, memoranda of any kind or\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, there is correspondence that Mr. Weissman\r\nhas, and I wonder if it would be convenient with the Commission if we\r\ncould return at 2:30. In the meantime I will be able to look at some of\r\nthe material he has to see if any of it is relevant and helpful to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would like to adjourn at this time if we can, because I\r\nhave a luncheon appointment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is what I am suggesting, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Good.\r\n\r\nWe will adjourn until 2:30.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BERNARD WILLIAM WEISSMAN RESUMED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2:45 p.m.\r\n\r\n(The Chairman and Mr. Dulles being present.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order. You may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, Bernard Weissman was recalled as a witness and having been\r\npreviously duly sworn, testified further as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, during the luncheon hour Mr. Weissman\r\nhas afforded us an opportunity to examine some of this correspondence,\r\nto which he made reference this morning. I have selected a few of these\r\npieces of correspondence as rounding out the genesis of CUSA and its\r\naffiliate, AMBUS, and the infiltration of the rightist organizations in\r\nDallas that the witness described.\r\n\r\nI will identify these without reading from them, as some of them are\r\nrather lengthy.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. First, Mr. Weissman, I have a letter on the letterhead\r\nof National Indignation Convention, the top of which has scrawled in\r\nink longhand \"Top Secret.\" It is a five-page longhand letter. At the\r\nbottom of each is written the word \"Destroy.\" I have marked an envelope\r\npostmarked Dallas, Tex., on November 5, 1962 as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1048, the first exhibit being identified as Commission Exhibit No. 1047.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked respectively Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 1047 and 1048 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The envelope is addressed to SP-4 Larry Jones, APO Station\r\n407, New York, N.Y.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize the handwriting on the envelope?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; that is Larrie's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the Larry Jones is the man to whom you made reference\r\nin your testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The document Commission Exhibit No. 1047, do you recognize\r\nthat handwriting?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It appears to be Larrie's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was document Commission Exhibit No. 1047, enclosed in\r\nthe envelope marked Commission Exhibit No. 1048?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there any signature on those documents?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This page should be last.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the page which is marked with a circle 7, there appears\r\nto be a signature L-a-r-r-i-e. Do you recognize that signature?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is Larrie Schmidt's signature.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you come into possession of the documents now\r\nidentified, one of which was addressed to Larry Jones rather than you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larry Jones gave it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In Munich, Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And when he handed the document to you was Exhibit No. 1047\r\nenclosed in Exhibit No. 1048?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Next is a three-page letter dated Dallas, Tex., January 4,\r\n1963, typewritten, addressed to \"Dear Bernie.\" Is that you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Marked as Commission Exhibit No. 1040.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1040 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is signed in typing \"Larrie.\"\r\n\r\nA document of five pages marked Commission Exhibit No. 1041 on the\r\nfirst page of which appears the signature Larrie H. Schmidt.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1041 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize that signature?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Whose is it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie Schmidt's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The last of this series of letter-sized papers is\r\na five-page document titled \"A Code of Conduct for Members of\r\nConservatism U.S.A.\" which has been marked Commission Exhibit No. 1042.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1042 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I understand that these three documents that I have\r\nnow identified were enclosed in an envelope which has been marked\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1043, in the upper left-hand corner, L. H.\r\nSchmidt, 5417b Lewis Street, Dallas 6, Tex., addressed to Private First\r\nClass Bernie Weissman. Is that you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is me.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1043 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is postmarked Dallas, January 4, 1963.\r\n\r\nDid you receive the documents, now identified as Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 1040, 1041, 1042, and 1043?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were the first of those three--were the first three of\r\nthose exhibits I have named enclosed in the document identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1043?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have already identified the signature.\r\n\r\nThese documents relate to the development of and plans for CUSA, do\r\nthey not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. They do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the conduct of CUSA?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The next two documents, a three-page letter typed on the\r\ntop \"Headquarters Conservatism U.S.A.,\" dated February 2, 1963, at\r\nDallas, Tex., 5417b Lewis Street, which I have marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1049.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1049 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is addressed \"To All Members.\" It is signed in typing\r\n\"Sincerely, Larrie.\" Have you seen that document before?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was it enclosed in an envelope?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it sent to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that document the envelope Commission Exhibit No. 1050?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1050 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is handwriting on the face of Exhibit No. 1050. Whose\r\nhandwriting is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is mine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Read it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. \"Meeting with Bob Morris. Infiltration of YAF by CUSA.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Commission, the\r\nthree-page document relates to a meeting held in the home of Dr.\r\nMorris. Is that Dr. Robert Morris?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right, of Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which recounts the plans for infiltration of conservative\r\ngroups in Dallas, Tex., upon which the witness has somewhat expanded\r\nin his testimony this morning.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Has the witness indicated who Mr. Bob Morris was? I don't\r\nrecall that.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Bob Morris at that time was president of the Defenders of\r\nAmerican Liberties in Dallas, Tex., and recently was a candidate for\r\npolitical office in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What office?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe he was running in the primary for Senator.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. U.S. Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. U.S. Senator.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I just want to be sure I have covered this. You received\r\nboth of the documents now marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 1050 and 1049\r\nin due course through the U.S. mail at your station in Munich, Germany?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The next series is--consists of a two-page letter which has\r\nbeen marked Commission Exhibit No. 1044, addressed to \"Dear Bernie\" at\r\nDallas, Tex., on June 13, 1963, also signed in typing \"Best, Larrie.\"\r\nThat is again Larrie Schmidt, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1044 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That document was enclosed in what?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In this envelope here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the envelope is marked Commission Exhibit No. 1046?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1046 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For the purposes of the record, Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1046 is an envelope postmarked at Dallas, Tex., on June 14, 1963.\r\nThe envelope is imprinted with \"Young Americans for Freedom. Inc.,\r\nSouthwestern U.S. Regional Headquarters, P.O. Box 2364, Dallas 21,\r\nTexas,\" and addressed to Pfc. Bernie Weissman. That is you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there anything else enclosed in an envelope?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I believe it was this.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A newspaper clipping from the Dallas Morning News which\r\nhas been marked and identified as Commission Exhibit No. 1045. Is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1045 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The caption of this reads \"Panel Reports Birch Society\r\nDedicated But Not Dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThose three documents were received by you from Larrie Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The third from the last of this series, a letter dated at\r\nDallas, Tex., June 2, 1963, addressed to \"Dear Bernie,\" Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1037. Also in typing \"Larrie.\" Who is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1037 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is some handwriting at the bottom of that letter--do\r\nyou recognize it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; that is Larrie Schmidt's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive that document?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was the handwriting on the document when you received\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it enclosed in an envelope?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You received the mail, then.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the envelope I now show you marked Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 1037-A?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1037-A for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Addressed to you. Was there something further enclosed with\r\nthose?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think this piece.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which is Commission Exhibit No. 1037-B.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1037-B for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is a handbill of Young Americans For Freedom, Inc.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You received all three documents I have now identified as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 1037, 1037-A, and 1037-B in due course through\r\nthe U.S. mail.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Next to the last of this series is a letter, single page\r\nmarked Commission Exhibit No. 1038, dated June 26, 1963, at Dallas,\r\nTex., addressed to \"Dear Bernie\" signed again in typewriting as\r\n\"Larrie.\" Have you seen that document before?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first see it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. When I received it in the mail.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you an envelope marked Commission Exhibit No. 1038-A.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1038-A for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that envelope the envelope in which Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 1038 was enclosed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; and as a reference, the handwriting on the outside\r\nof these envelopes on this and the other exhibits that refer to the\r\ncontents were put on by me about a week ago, so I could identify it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please read what you have written on the face of Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1038-A.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. \"Ready to take over YAF. Jones in Dallas. Ducharme Club.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that Ducharme Club is the club, the private club,\r\nsemi-private club in Dallas that you mentioned in your testimony this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Lastly, a single-page exhibit, Commission Exhibit No. 1039,\r\ndated at Munich, Germany, on July 31, 1963.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1039 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This purports to be a copy of a letter apparently from you\r\nto Larrie Schmidt, is that correct, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this is a carbon copy of the actual letter?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you mail the original of this?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Larrie Schmidt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On or about the date this letter bears?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What date is that?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. July 21, 1963.\r\n\r\nOn Commission Exhibit No. 1043, which is the envelope which enclosed\r\nseveral other exhibits, there is some handwriting. It that yours?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you read it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. \"Membership List 1962. Code of Conduct and Introduction\r\nto CUSA. Ultimatum.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is a shorthand description or summary of the\r\ncontents of the envelope?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On Commission Exhibit No. 1048, which is also an envelope,\r\nthere appears to be written on the face \"NIC Infiltration.\" Whose\r\nhandwriting it that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's mine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you put it on there under the circumstances you have\r\nnow related?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Weissman, I will show you Commission Exhibit No. 996.\r\nHave you ever seen a counterpart of that exhibit which is entitled\r\n\"Wanted for Treason\"?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never directly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us about your first acquaintance with that, with the\r\ncircumstances, if you know, of how it came into existence, and who had\r\nanything to do with it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I can only go by hearsay on this--what I have seen\r\nand what I have heard from other individuals.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did this come to your attention before November 22, 1963,\r\nor after?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. After.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell what you know, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I had heard that these handbills were distributed\r\nsomewhere in North Dallas, I believe, on the university campus I\r\nbelieve it was, the University of Dallas campus.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From what source did you hear this?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Now, I think it was--I am not sure--I think it might have\r\nbeen Larrie or his brother Bob. I am not sure. Larrie declaimed any\r\nknowledge of this. I know he had nothing to do with this particular\r\nhandbill.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He would have told me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That's the basis for your supposition?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; and I saw this handbill, or something similar to\r\nit, in the back of a station wagon used by Larrie's brother Bob in\r\ntransporting----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was several days after the assassination. There\r\nwas one crumpled up in the back. And I happened to look through the\r\nwindow and see it. This was in front of the Ducharme Club, as a\r\nmatter of fact. It was one night. And I saw this. And I saw something\r\n\"Treason\"--I had heard about the handbills.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From whom?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Excuse me?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From whom, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I think it was Larrie. I cannot be hundred percent sure.\r\nI did not take too much interest in it at the time. But in any case,\r\nI did see something resembling this, only it seemed to be a larger\r\npicture of President Kennedy. But in any case, it was in the back of\r\na station wagon owned by General Walker, Edwin Walker, or by what--if\r\nincorporated, by the corporation he is with, chairman of.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, I know that Bob was General Walker's chauffeur,\r\nand by seeing this crumpled up in the back, behind the front seat on\r\nthe floor of the car, I naturally assumed that it had something to do\r\nwith General Walker. Exactly what or how, or if he had distributed it,\r\nI have no idea. I do not have the faintest idea. I did not go into it\r\nany further, because I felt that everything was past, and I was leaving\r\nDallas anyway. I had made up my mind.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say you had heard about this matter, that is the\r\nhandbill, or handbill similar to it, had you heard about that before\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not to my recollection, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Shortly after that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And before you left Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have anything to do with the bringing into\r\nexistence of this or similar handbills?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None; none whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Other than the possibility of Bob Schmidt having something\r\nto do with them under the circumstances you have related, did any\r\nothers of your group have anything to do with creating this type of\r\nliterature and distribution of handbills?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None that I know of.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How about the names of those people who were in on it?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the handbill?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you become acquainted at any time with Robert A. Surrey?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. With Robert G. Klause?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. With J. T. Monk?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you become acquainted at any time with the Johnson\r\nPrinting Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have any materials printed--and when I say you, I\r\nmean you or your group--while you were in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not that I know of. I personally have no knowledge of\r\nanything being printed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever hear of the Lettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever hear of Ashland Frederick Birchwell?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or have any contact with him?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not that I know of. I guess I must have met two or three\r\ndozen people. For example, when we went up to Joe Grinnan's office at\r\nvarious times, we would come down and eat in the cafeteria, and there\r\nwould be somebody sitting with him, and there would be introductions. I\r\nnever remembered their names, because it was just in passing. I never\r\nhad any personal contact, really.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you meet General Walker at any time while you were in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Never did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you meet anybody or know anybody by the name of Mercer?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. While you were in Dallas--Mrs. Clifford or Dorothy Mercer?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or Mr. Clifford Mercer?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Definitely not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Among the exhibits we have identified this afternoon is a\r\nlist of members. Those were the members of CUSA as of that particular\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the changes in membership you have recounted in your\r\ntestimony this morning, is that correct, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I am sorry--I knew I had left something out of\r\none of those. I do not know which exhibit is. But it is the one that\r\nsays----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will hand them back to you, and you can tell me.\r\n\r\nYou now have in your hand a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it that sheet of paper came from one of the\r\nenvelopes we have already marked?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This one here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The answer is yes?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will mark this sheet as Commission Exhibit No. 1051.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1051 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us in what envelope Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1051 was enclosed?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 1043.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is Commission Exhibit No. 1051?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Commission Exhibit No. 1051 was a current membership list\r\nas of about January 4, 1963. If you like, I can go over this and tell\r\nyou who was in no way really associated with it at the time or active.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Membership in CUSA?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. In CUSA, yes. It lists Larrie Schmidt, Larry C. Jones,\r\nBernie Weissman, Norman Baker, James Moseley as partners. Members as\r\nKen Glazbrook, Bob Weiss, who was not active after about--at about the\r\ntime this was printed--these men dropped from the active list. Herb\r\nStarr was not active. Chuck McLain was not active. Richard Harsch was\r\nnot active. Hank Tanaro was not active. Sheila McDonald was not active.\r\nAnd the rest of the list were active in one form or another--some to a\r\nmuch lesser degree than the others.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, the 50-odd responses that you received to Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1031, when you went to the post office box on the following\r\nSunday, the 24th of November 1963, did you recognize the names of any\r\nof the persons who responded?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None--none at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any response from Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not under his name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you say about a third of those responses were favorable\r\nand two-thirds unfavorable.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Insofar as the questions asked on Exhibit--Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1031 are concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When you said there was no letter in the box under the\r\nname of Jack Ruby does that infer that there was one by any other name?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Well, to put it very exact, if I did receive a letter\r\nfrom Jack Ruby, I have no knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is what I wanted to know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And apart from--I asked you also the general question\r\nwhether you recognized any names. I would like to add to that--did\r\nyou recognize in reading over any of those letters or responses any\r\npersons, regardless of what name was signed to the document?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. During the noon recess I have had the witness read through\r\nan interview with him by the FBI on the 5th of December 1963. You have\r\nread that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that accurately reflect the interview which the FBI\r\nhad with you on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It does. The only variance you might find is that at the\r\ntime I had the interview with the FBI, I did not develop the CUSA story\r\nwith them. And they did not press the issue, and I did not go into it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it does accurately reflect what took place during the\r\ncourse of that interview.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What you said--it reports it accurately.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; very accurately.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I was using this method in order to\r\nshorten the balance of Mr. Weissman's testimony. There are many details\r\nhere that I wanted to spare the Commission.\r\n\r\nI will mark that with the next exhibit number, Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1052.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1052 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I offer in evidence the exhibits which\r\nhave been identified--I will read the exhibit numbers. Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 1031 through 1052, both inclusive, with some of the\r\nenvelopes designated with subletters A, and one of the other documents\r\ndesignated with the subletter B. I ask that those exhibits be admitted\r\nin evidence with the exhibit numbers which appear on them, each of\r\nwhich has been recited in the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to, heretofore marked for identification as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 1031 through 1052 inclusive, were received in\r\nevidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have no further questions of the witness. Mr. Flannery,\r\ndo you have anything?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles, do you have any questions you would like to\r\nask?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one general question. From the questions which have\r\nbeen addressed to you, Mr. Weissman, you have a general idea of what\r\nthe Commission, the area of search of the Commission is so far as you\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did anything occur to you of any significance which you\r\ncould add or would like to add to the answers you have made to the\r\nquestions you have already given?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Excuse me, please. There is just one thing but it is a\r\nquestion of--it is not a positive identification or anything like that.\r\nBut on the day I went to the post office to pick up the mail there was\r\na gentleman waiting, observing the box, the post office box in the\r\nDallas post office. Now, Bill Burley was waiting in my car outside,\r\ndriving around the block because the traffic was quite heavy. I went\r\nin with Ken Glazbrook, who had just come to Dallas about a day or so\r\nbefore by bus from the East Coast. He got off a freighter from Sweden.\r\nAnd this individual seemed to be about--I would put him at about 60\r\nyears old. And I thought about it since. And I said that might have\r\nbeen Jack Ruby, because he was short enough to be. But my recollection\r\nof the individual that followed me, when we subsequently lost in the\r\ncrowd, and jumped into the car and took off, was that one time not more\r\nthan 3 feet away from me--though I did not stare into his face, because\r\nI did not know if this fellow was going to shoot me or say something.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were then frightened; were you not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir. And we went across through traffic and up a\r\nstreet and down a street and lost this individual and jumped into the\r\ncar and took off back to the apartment. And to this day I do not know\r\nwhether it was Ruby--because frankly my recollection of the individual\r\non the pictures I have seen of Ruby in the newspapers, they do not seem\r\nto jibe--just the size. This fellow was about 5 foot 6 or so. He was\r\nwearing tan clothing with a Stetson hat, a tan Stetson hat.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A typical Texas western hat, sometimes called a 10-gallon\r\nhat?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. That's right. And this is about the only thing else I\r\nhave to add.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he follow you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. He followed us from the box down the steps of the post\r\noffice to the traffic light. We crossed the street, he walked up the\r\nother side of the street adjacent to the post office, directly opposite\r\nus. And we were going halfway up and he started to cross the corner. We\r\nquickly ran back to the corner, across which we came. At that time Bill\r\nhad come around the corner in the car, he knew nothing about it, we\r\njumped in, sat down low and went in a straight line, made the turn and\r\nwent back to the apartment. And I have never seen the individual since.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This post office box from which you were taking the mail,\r\nwas that box the one that was advertised in the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that the number of that box was known.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; it was. This individual was obviously waiting for\r\nme. I did not see him. Ken pointed him out to me. We expected possibly\r\nsome sort of trouble there. And Ken was walking about 6 feet to the\r\nright of me, on another side of the post office tables that are in the\r\nmiddle of the aisle. So if I got in any difficulty he would be there to\r\nhelp. And he noticed this individual and pointed him out to me. And\r\nthis fellow just followed us right out, and that was that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As I recall, you fixed the time when you went to the mail\r\nbox as probably sometime Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can you be any more definite as to the time Sunday morning\r\nwhen you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am almost 100 percent sure it was between 8 and 9\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator Cooper, have you any questions?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What age did the man seem to be?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. About 60.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have two or three other questions.\r\n\r\nDid your organization, CUSA, ever consider violence as a means to\r\nreaching its objectives?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This had been--I don't remember exactly. It had been\r\nhashed over in skull sessions, so many things come up, and you talk\r\nabout it and throw it away. These things did come up over the year\r\nor so that I was involved in it in Munich, and thrown out. No. In\r\nschedules that we had made up, we figured probable political happenings\r\nover a period of years, and we took into account there might be a war\r\nfor example in 1968 or 1970 or 1972, and what would happen before or\r\nafter, or who would probably be President at that time, and the type of\r\naction America would take. But it had never gone any further than a lot\r\nof supposition.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you consider the advertisements in the paper there\r\nas possibly inciting to violence under the circumstances?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Definitely not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was that considered at all?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Definitely not. At least not by me. And nobody ever\r\nmentioned it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. This group of men that you have named, of which you\r\nwere one, who formed this CUSA with objectives, both political and\r\nbusiness you said?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there any background of writings or theory of any\r\nkind upon which you depended? Where did it come from?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Let's see. You are putting me in sort of a box but I\r\nwill answer you. We read, for example--for example, I did not know I\r\nwas a conservative until I got to Germany. I just knew how I felt. But\r\nI never identified myself with any particular political leaning. I\r\nthought I was a Democrat, an independent voter and independent thinker.\r\nFor example, I voted for Kennedy in 1960 and I would have voted against\r\nhim in 1964. But this is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nWe were asked--not asked--we had a list of required reading. In\r\nother words, if you are going to expound the conservative philosophy\r\nwe figured you should know something about it, a little bit of the\r\nbackground, aside from your own personal feelings. So we read, for\r\nexample--I didn't--I never did find the time to do it--some of the\r\nfellows read \"Conscience of a Conservative\" by Barry Goldwater, one or\r\ntwo books that Barry Goldwater had written, and \"Atlas Shrugged\" by Ayn\r\nRand, which I did not read.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did the others read them?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I guess Larrie read them, because he suggested these.\r\nThere were many times when I said yes--I yessed him to death, and did\r\nas I pleased. And this is one of the cases.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That was about the extent of your reading background?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Not completely. In other words, I cannot point to any\r\nspecific volumes that I read for the specific purpose of giving me a\r\ncertain background. In other words, I am motivated personally by my own\r\nfeelings in the situation, and the particular dogma that you might read\r\nin a book does not interest me too much.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. As one of your aims, did you have the purpose of making\r\nsome money out of this movement?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Out of the movement itself, no. Out of the business, yes.\r\nBecause I think it would be foolish to go on the premise that if we\r\nwould devote ourselves a hundred percent to politics that we could make\r\nmoney at it, because there are laws against it, and in order to survive\r\nwhile you are in politics, you have to have a business interest,\r\nmanaged by yourself part time or by others full time, that can support\r\nyou while you devote yourself to politics.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was this business interest to be these organizations\r\nwhich you were going to infiltrate and whose treasuries you might\r\ncapture?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Or was it to be--you hoped to develop businesses\r\nbecause of your political influence; is that it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; to put it straight on the record, we had discussed\r\nthis, and what we would do if we came into any of the treasuries\r\nof these organizations. We felt that you can incur a lot of legal\r\nproblems if you are caught taking funds, tax-free funds, and using it\r\nfor personal gain and so forth. I am sure there are laws against it.\r\nExactly which ones, I do not know. I am sure there are laws against it.\r\n\r\nAnd so we felt there is nothing wrong, and it is done occasionally in\r\ngovernment, where occasionally you would use--you would meet someone\r\npolitically--because generally these are more affluent individuals,\r\npeople in politics. By dint of their drive they have acquired property\r\nor moneys, et cetera. And these individuals might be willing to invest\r\nsome of their capital in some up-and-coming young businessmen, young\r\npoliticians. And we had hoped to get some money this way. Plus the\r\nfact, by using our heads, by setting up businesses on our own that\r\nwould support us in the political goal.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you study methods of propaganda?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Study methods of propaganda? No; we had discussed ways\r\nof bringing about recruitment and so forth, in the way of pamphlets,\r\nor things of that nature, but this never got out of the talking stage\r\nitself. As a matter of fact----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You felt the way to move into political life quickly\r\nwas to get into these extreme organizations which do use a great deal\r\nof propaganda, and are against things?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. Yes; in general, we thought these organizations because\r\nthey grew so quickly, would be relatively unorganized and easy to\r\ninfiltrate, and this proves to be quite true. They were more or less\r\nautonomous within their own regions, and they did not have a national\r\ndirector keeping tabs on everything they did.\r\n\r\nI have something here that was made up. It is just a list. I just\r\nhappened to remember. Publicity tactics, for example--rallies,\r\nhangings--these are effigies, I would imagine--demonstrations,\r\npicketing, sit-downs, stickers, billboards, boycotts, lectures,\r\nsongfests, talkathons, telephone campaigns, door-to-door campaigns.\r\nPublicity--letters, brochures, pamphlets, booklets, stationery, flags,\r\nsongs, emblems on blazers, stickers, match covers, billboards, radio,\r\nTV, newspapers, magazines, streetcars, taxicabs. Fund-raising would be\r\npersonal solicitation, get firms to do things free for us, parties,\r\nteas, bridges, lectures, assessments, dues, sale of books, pins,\r\nbuttons, stationery, flags, emblems, match covers, brochures, and\r\npamphlets. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was your program?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. This was our advertising program; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Some of these activities are certainly activities\r\ncarried on by political parties. But did it ever occur to you that some\r\nof the activities which you planned, in fact which you undertook, such\r\nas infiltration into an organization, to try to seize control of it,\r\nand these methods that you used--do you consider that as in the regular\r\nspirit of our system of government?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I would say this, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Democratic system you spoke of?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. It was a question of doing something like that, or\r\nabsolutely nothing at all, never getting off the ground. And while my\r\nbelief would say no, of course not, this is not the way you do it, this\r\nis not the way it should be done, but it was expedient at the time\r\nto do this. And plus the fact that you certainly could not make these\r\norganizations any worse than they were. And as far as I felt, if we\r\ncould bring them around to our way of thinking or my way of thinking,\r\nwe could have brought them around to where they were more beneficial to\r\nthe country rather than detrimental.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all I want to ask.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I noticed on the list that you had there of techniques\r\nwas hangings. Now, you said--you added to that, I think, that that\r\nmeant hanging in effigy, you assumed. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. I am 100 percent sure, Your Honor, that that is what it\r\nmeant. In other words, this was just ways to attract attention, and the\r\ncollege students are doing it all the time. It was just sort of tossing\r\nit all in a pot and then putting it down on paper.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is that not provocative to violence?\r\n\r\nMr. WEISSMAN. No; I think in the context that we meant it, that it was\r\njust another way of getting possibly some publicity--like if students\r\nin a university do not like their professor, for example, or if they\r\nwin a football game, they will hang the opposing team in effigy, or\r\nthe captain, or what have you. And it attracts a certain amount of\r\npublicity and talk.\r\n\r\nWe had to gain recognition in order to accomplish some of the goals\r\nthat I had stated previously. And this is just another way. In this\r\ncase, you have to consider us as young men, and effigy hanging, you\r\nknow, is just part of a young idea.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I think that is all. Thank you very much, Mr. Weissman.\r\nYou may be excused. And Mr. Flannery, thank you very much for your\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions you would like to ask, you may feel free to\r\ndo so now.\r\n\r\nMr. FLANNERY. I have nothing.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well.\r\n\r\n(At this point in the hearing, Chairman Warren left the hearing room\r\nand the witness Robert G. Klause entered.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT G. KLAUSE\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you kindly raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are Robert G. Klause?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you appear here voluntarily today?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I may say, Mr. Chairman, I reached Mr. Klause in Dallas\r\nyesterday afternoon. He had just returned from a 2-week vacation.\r\nHe volunteered to come. The Secret Service got him on a plane with\r\nbut minutes to spare, and no baggage. This he did to accommodate the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nMr. Klause is here to testify with respect to the genesis and\r\ndissemination of the \"Wanted For Treason\" handbill, Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 996.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Proceed, please.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your age, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. 32.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are a married man?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were born and reared in this country?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Likewise your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your parents?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you reside in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What address?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. 1126 South Waverly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is the name of your mother?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Dorothy Anna Mercer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is she engaged in a printing business in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She and her husband?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is her husband's first name? Clifford?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Clifford; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you employed in their business?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the Lettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is located where?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. 2615 Oak Lawn, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And how long have you been employed in the Lettercraft\r\nPrinting Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I would say approximately about a year and a half. I think\r\nwe have been open about a year and a half, it might be going on 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And tell us what the nature of that printing company is.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Offset lithography, letterheads, statements, envelopes,\r\nthings like that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it a small house?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you employed theretofore by a different printing\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you formerly employed by another printing company in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Johnson Printing Co.; yes, sir. With several other\r\ncompanies in town.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. And where is Johnson Printing Co. located?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I think it is the 2700 block of Haskell in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you become acquainted with Robert A. Surrey while you\r\nwere employed at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you known him before that?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you a document which has been identified and\r\nadmitted in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 996. The particular\r\ndocument I show you is a Xerox reproduction of the original exhibit.\r\n\r\nDid you play some part in producing the original, the original copy and\r\nmaterials from which the Exhibit No. 996 I show you was prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I am not too sure what you mean but as far as\r\nlaying--laying the job out, no, sir. Now, like I said, I ran the job. I\r\nshot the negatives.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Perhaps we can get at it this way, sir. When first did you\r\nhave any connection with this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Approximately, I would say, a month before President\r\nKennedy came to town.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did that arise?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Mr. Surrey called on me and asked me if I would run a job.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say he called on you. Where were you when he called on\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I believe I was at the shop. In fact, I know I was at the\r\nshop. He must have called me at the shop.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say shop, you mean the Lettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He came to Lettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; he called.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. He said that he had a little job he would like to have run,\r\nand would I run it myself?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you responded?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I said yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he come over to your shop?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Mr. Jenner, to be honest with you, really I do not remember\r\nnow. I might have gone out, or he might have come over. To be perfectly\r\nhonest, right at the present time I do not remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did I understand you to say that you said to him you would\r\nrun it yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mean by that something distinct from or having\r\nLettercraft Printing Co. run it?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. He asked me if I was interested in doing a little job on\r\nthe side, and I said yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By \"on the side,\" does that mean that you were going to\r\ndo some reproduction printing for him, other than as a job for the\r\nLettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir. You see, I have my own shop.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where is that located?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Actually, I operate out of my house. But I have always had\r\nmy own shop. I mean I have two or three little insert accounts that\r\nI do, and a couple of beauty suppliers. They will come in and want\r\n500 letterheads. For a long time, when I was out of work, I went out\r\nand solicited work door to door. Then I would job them out to other\r\nprinters. And then when I could get my hands on a press, I would run\r\nthem myself.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was Mr. Surrey aware of this practice?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; I am sure he was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he proposed to you at the outset that you do it \"on the\r\nside\"?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you met with Mr. Surrey after this telephone call?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall whether it was at your home or whether it was\r\nat the Lettercraft Co. or some other place?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Actually, like I say, Mr. Jenner, I am not real sure. I\r\ndo not know whether it was out at--I am pretty sure it was not at the\r\nshop. And Mr. Surrey has never been to my house. And so it must have\r\nbeen out.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, there are two reproductions of President Kennedy, a\r\nprofile and a front view. Did you prepare the plates from which those\r\nprofiles were made?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. By preparing the plates--the only thing that I actually did\r\nis--either it was two newspaper clippings or magazine clippings.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From whom did you receive the magazine clippings?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. From Mr. Surrey.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They were slick paper magazine clippings?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Something on a slick paper basis; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That contained the front and profile of President Kennedy,\r\nwhich is reproduced on Commission Exhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, what did you do with those two slick magazine\r\nreproductions of President Kennedy's head?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, I tried to shoot them, and I could not shoot them. We\r\nhave our own camera. We take a picture of it--reproduce it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You must assume that none of us is experienced in the\r\nprinting business. And when you say \"shoot\"----\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I will explain myself more carefully. When they were\r\nbrought to me----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By Mr. Surrey?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir. Then I tried to make negatives of them----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Negatives on film?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; on film.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I could not do it. When I take a picture of copy, on most\r\nof your offset or lithography work, you have dot patterns. And when\r\nI would try to use my camera, the dot patterns would kind of blur,\r\nand you could not see what it was. It was just a big blur. So I sent\r\nthe negatives of the two pictures downtown, down to Monk Brothers\r\nLithography Service downtown, which shoots nothing but negatives.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is J. T. Monk?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Tommy Monk, of Monk Bros.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. J. T. Monk is the father, and Tommy Monk, or J. T. Monk,\r\nJr., is the son.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. The only person I know down there is Tommy.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He is a young man?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; Tommy I have known 12 or 13 years. He is somewhere\r\naround 50, 55, probably.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is he the apparent owner or manager at least of this----\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it a lithography company?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, it is a negative service. In other words, what\r\nthey do is supply the printers with blanks, and ink, and ink knives,\r\ndifferent fountain solutions, things like that, for the press, and also\r\nthey have their own cameras. They have probably two $15,000 or $20,000\r\ncameras there. And, of course, they can produce work from their cameras\r\nI cannot touch on my little camera, or our camera at the shop.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So you took the two magazine pictures of President Kennedy\r\nto Monk Bros.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For the purpose of having Monk Bros. make negatives, film\r\nnegatives of them?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which in turn were to be employed to do what?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. To be employed to be run on this job. I mean it was part of\r\nthis piece right here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And do you recall what the charge was by Monk Bros. for\r\nthat service?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; I think it was around three and a half, four and a\r\nhalf, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you pay in cash?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you paid in cash because you did not want it charged to\r\nLettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; I originally had a charge account at Monk Bros.\r\nBut I still owe a little on my bill down there; and at the time I just\r\nrather had paid for it. Not knowing what the job was then anyway--I\r\nmean when I go down there and buy supplies for myself, since--I owe the\r\nman money, I try whatever I can to pay for, because I have got a pretty\r\nnice little bill down there now, and I do not want to run it up any\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you received the negatives, then what did you do with\r\nthe negatives?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, the bottom part was shot, or picture was made with\r\nthe camera at our shop; and then I stripped the negative in. In other\r\nwords, I put the two top pieces, the picture and the bottom part\r\ntogether. And then made a plate on it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Made a plate from those negatives?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In turn to be employed in printing the handbill?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you received those negatives, did you again\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Surrey?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I do not believe I understand what you mean, Mr. Jenner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After you obtained usable negatives from Monk Bros., did\r\nyou advise Mr. Surrey that you now had obtained those usable negatives\r\nand would be able to proceed with the job?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had Mr. Surrey advised you as to how many he wished of\r\nthese handbills?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Approximately--he said approximately 6,000, 7,000.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You made a plate from which the front and profile of\r\nPresident Kennedy as appears on Exhibit No. 996 was made?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, there is copy below the profile and front view, as you\r\nwill notice on the exhibit before you. From what source did you receive\r\nthat copy?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. That copy came, sir; as was--just approximately about the\r\nway it is here. I do not know whether it was typed on--I do not know\r\nthat much about a Varitypewriter. Or it might have been letterpress.\r\nSomebody might have set it up letterpress or Linotype, and ran a press\r\nproof; I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From whom did you receive that press-proof copy?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I received all the copy from Mr. Surrey.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the copy, then, as you received it from Mr. Surrey,\r\nwhich is in turn reflected on Commission Exhibit No. 996, was in the\r\nform at that time, when you received it from Mr. Surrey, that it now\r\nappears in on Commission Exhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you reproduce it onto the handbill?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, this was run offset, like I said, all of it was put\r\non film. Then it was burnt into what we call a metal plate, which we\r\nexpose to light. It is a light-sensitive plate, and any time light hits\r\nit, where you have clear spots on your film, that image of the light\r\nwill burn into your plate. When you process the plate out, you come up\r\nwith a developer, which brings the image out. Then once you put that\r\nplate on the press, that image will pick up type.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did Mr. Surrey bring you that copy with respect to the\r\ntime when he brought the two slick magazine reproductions of President\r\nKennedy's profile and front views?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I believe it was all at the same time. This was--the\r\npictures were the only thing I even took out of the envelope at one\r\ntime. The rest of it I did not even bother to look at.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who, if anybody, assisted you in printing up the handbills?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Nobody.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Klause did not help you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. She was in front of the shop. In fact, I do not even think\r\nshe ever came back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say shop are you talking now of your own shop in\r\nyour home or the shop at Lettercraft?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Lettercraft.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So the handbills were actually printed by you in the\r\nLettercraft Printing Co. shop?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; after hours.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After you had--how many did you print, if you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I would say, Mr. Jenner, approximately 5,000--5,200, 5,300.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you do with them after you printed them?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I put them in a box. In fact, I did not even wrap them. I\r\njust stuck them in a box. And I contacted Mr. Surrey the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And now, give us your recollection as to when you made\r\ncontact with Mr. Surrey--with particular reference to November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I would say, sir; it was approximately 2 or 2-1/2 weeks\r\nbefore Mr. Kennedy was in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would be the early part of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; as close as I can remember right now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you deliver the 5,000 plus handbills personally to Mr.\r\nSurrey?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And where did that delivery take place?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Now, that I do remember. That was about 5 blocks\r\napproximately from the shop. It was--from Lettercraft. It was a little\r\ncafe there which we call the Waffle Shop. It is the Pal's Waffle Shop.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make--I take it then you made arrangements with Mr.\r\nSurrey to meet him at Pal's Waffle Shop, rather than he come to the\r\nLettercraft Printing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I called him and told him that they were ready, and he\r\nsaid, \"Where can I meet you?\" and I was getting ready to go to lunch at\r\nthe time anyway. I believe it was lunch or coffee. I said, \"I'm getting\r\nready to go out for coffee. I am going to go up about 5 blocks up the\r\nstreet to the Waffle Shop.\" He said, \"I'll meet you there, then.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Mrs. Klause accompany you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; she was at work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anybody accompany you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You met Mr. Surrey at the Pal's Waffle Shop?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You delivered him all of the handbills you had printed up?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What color were those?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. The handbills were run on what we call assorted dodger\r\nstock--green and orange and blue and yellow. It is a cheap colored\r\nnewspaper print is what it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From where did you obtain the assorted dodger stock?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Olmstead Kirk Paper Co.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make it as an individual purchase or was that a\r\npurchase on behalf of the Lettercraft Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No; that was my own purchase.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You purchased that and paid for it in cash?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, were you paid for this work you did for Mr. Surrey?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what did he pay you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I think it was $40, Mr. Jenner. In fact, I am almost\r\npositive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it in cash?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When next did you see Mr. Surrey after you had delivered\r\nthe handbills to him?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I would say approximately 2 or 3 weeks after Mr. Kennedy\r\nwas assassinated in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So I take it then you had no contact with Mr. Surrey of any\r\nkind or character from the day you delivered the 5,000 plus handbills\r\nto him in Pal's Waffle Shop until some 2 weeks after President\r\nKennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That whole time span was a month to 5 weeks?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; and then at that time I called Mr. Surrey myself\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Like I said, I have two or three accounts, and I had one\r\njob that I could not run, it was a big job. A lot of printers will work\r\nwith other printers in jobbing out work. I took this job and jobbed it\r\nout--Mr. Surrey jobbed it out to Johnson, and let Johnson run it. And I\r\nin turn paid Bob for the job, when the people paid me, and I delivered\r\nthe job, and I made a commission off of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On that occasion when you saw Mr. Surrey, did you have a\r\nconversation--did you have any conversation with him with respect to\r\nthe dodger or handbill, Commission Exhibit No. 996?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; I imagine there was. I cannot exactly say what\r\nit is now. But I imagine there was something said--because I was quite\r\nupset about it at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The FBI interviewed you about this incident, did they not?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. The Secret Service did; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And when you were first interviewed, you did not disclose\r\nto the Secret Service the facts with respect to Mr. Surrey delivering\r\nthis material to you and your having printed it for him, delivered it\r\nto him, and he paying you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; nothing at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What led you to do that, Mr. Klause?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, I started thinking about it, and then the folks were\r\ngetting real upset about it, because I had put them in a jam, which it\r\nwas my own fault.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say folks, you mean your mother and stepfather?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; and I mean I like to help friends as much as I\r\ncan, and be good to people as much as I can. But people in my family\r\nare going to come closer than my friends are.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You finally decided to reveal the full facts respecting\r\nthis handbill?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you did so to the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Mr. Surrey approach you at any time to suggest to you\r\nthat you should not reveal the source of this handbill?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; I talked to him--I believe it was probably a\r\ncouple of days after the Secret Service was out. And I told him those\r\npeople were wanting to know things--I mean doing their job, that they\r\nwanted to find something out.\r\n\r\nI said this is strictly out of my territory--I did not know what I was\r\nsupposed to do. And he said, well, I could either get myself a lawyer\r\nor just not say anything at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever tell him you made up your mind you were going\r\nto tell the full facts about this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; not really. I think in so many words he might have\r\nunderstood that I was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he ever make a remark to you, \"Well, that is the way\r\nthe ball bounces.\"\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. It sounds like--it seems to ring a bell, but I cannot place\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that not in fact said by him in connection with your\r\ntelling him that you had reached the conclusion that you had to tell\r\nthe full facts about this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that refresh your recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. The ball bounces--yes, sir--that rings a bell now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to November 22, 1963, had you ever heard the name Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you ever seen anybody up to that day who purported to\r\nbe or whom you were advised was Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I show you Garner Exhibit No. 1. Did you ever see that man\r\nprior to November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir. The only time I seen this man was on television\r\nand in the paper.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mean on or after November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 520, and direct your\r\nattention to the center figure appearing on that photograph. Did you\r\never see that man prior to November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Surrey as to the\r\npurpose for which the handbill was to be put?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you read this copy, did that not alarm you or upset\r\nyou? It is rather provocative, is it not, and it has a title \"Wanted\r\nfor Treason.\"\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Actually, Mr. Jenner, I did not even pay any attention to\r\nthe copy at all. It was late at night at the time I ran it. I did not\r\npay any attention to it at all--which I should have done, I admit now.\r\nBut I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were running it at night because you were doing this on\r\nthe side?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do have some printing equipment in your own apartment\r\nor home?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir. Not at my house; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You used the equipment of the Lettercraft Printing Co., did\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you did this at night because you were doing it on the\r\nside with the Lettercraft Printing Co. equipment?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you advise your mother or your stepfather you were\r\ndoing this?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Now, let me explain this to you. When they opened the\r\nshop up I started to work for approximately $35 a week, and what few\r\naccounts I had, I turned over to the shop, and there was a couple of\r\nlittle accounts, like friends of mine that I ran around with, rode\r\nmotorcycles with and things like that, that I kept for myself. And I\r\nmean that was my spending money. And they made the understanding--we\r\nmade the understanding, when the shop was opened, that whatever little\r\njobs like that that I had, I could do on the side at night--as long as\r\nit did not interfere with work during the day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you tell your mother or stepfather that you had done\r\nthis work?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you tell them eventually?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They found out about it eventually?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You kept the money, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know General Edwin A. Walker, resigned?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you ever heard of him?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I have heard of him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever have any contact with him?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you aware that Robert A. Surrey was associated with\r\nGeneral Edwin A. Walker at the time you made up these handbills?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have any acquaintance with Robert A. Surrey other\r\nthan as a fellow employee at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this incident about which you have testified?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there? Did Surrey ever tell you\r\nwhat he intended to do with these throwaways, or posters, or make any\r\nremarks about them at all?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir. He just asked me to do the job--said he had a\r\ncustomer that wanted it done. And that is all that was ever said about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He did not tell you what the customer wanted to do with\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But at the very outset he asked you to do this on the side?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I think I am going to have to leave now.\r\nI have no further questions.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you ever heard of the American Eagle Publishing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir. It takes a minute to ring a bell, but it rings a\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever do any work for the American Eagle Publishing\r\nCo.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is a company with which Mr. Surrey is associated?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; I believe so. That is why I heard that mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you become acquainted with that fact? And when?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I believe there was a discussion one day that sometimes on\r\njobs--I think this was done, we talked about this at Johnson at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At the time you were employed at Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir. That jobs would come in that he would send\r\nthrough--might not be too much commission in it or something, or might\r\nnot be a big job, where he would job through this place, which in turn\r\nthen would job back through Johnson. Then he would get probably a\r\nmarkup plus a commission. How it is worked, I do not know, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were aware of the fact that Mr. Surrey and General\r\nWalker were the two partners in American Eagle Publishing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you knew he had some connection with the company--Mr.\r\nSurrey?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir. Like I said, he had mentioned it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Surrey had mentioned it to you. Did he tell you he was\r\nan officer of that company?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Well, as far as I knew, he was sole owner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. It is what I thought was an assumed name, like myself. I\r\ndo not know how the laws are here, but in Texas when you open up in\r\nbusiness, you have got to file an assumed name certificate--if it is\r\nunder an assumed name or your name or whatever the name is, you have to\r\nfile that business.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have an assumed name certificate for your private\r\nbusiness?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is it?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Klause Printing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you not aware of the fact that Mr. Surrey had some\r\nconnection with General Edwin A. Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At no time?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever see that tall yellow covered book published\r\nalmost like a pamphlet, published by the American Eagle Publishing Co.,\r\nwhich contained reprints of various news stories of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; this might be hard to believe. I saw the book. In\r\nfact, I think I have a copy of it. But to this day, I have yet to crack\r\nthe cover on it. I have never even opened it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What I want to question you about--did you look at the back\r\nof the book, the back cover of the book?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; I noticed the front, and put it in the car. I\r\ncarried it in the car for about a week, with a bunch of my scratch pads\r\nI hand out to my customers. And one night I went home to unload the\r\ncar, and I unloaded everything out of the car and put it in the house.\r\nAnd since then I never looked at it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You never noticed that Surrey appears on the backside of\r\nthe back cover as the president of the American Eagle Publishing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you ever heard of the Carousel Club in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; I have heard of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you know where it is located?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. All I can tell you, sir, it is downtown. I have never been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have never been there?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever meet Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever see Jack Ruby prior to the 24th of November\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; I have never seen him and have never met him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You've never seen him before or since or on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever have any business with him of any kind or\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; as soon as he was put in jail, from what I\r\nunderstand, the biggest part of his property went up for sale, and the\r\npeople--some people that bought some of his property, or bought his\r\nbusiness, called on us to do a job.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; this was after--in fact, I imagine sometime\r\nafter his trial. And I called on those people. We printed I think\r\n500 letterheads and 500 envelopes, something like that, plus 2,000\r\ncirculars about open from 7 until 2 in the morning, and then the dance\r\nband who was there. In fact, they still owe the bill at the shop. In\r\nfact from what I understand, that place is closed up again now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Lettercraft Printing Co. ever do any work for Jack\r\nRuby, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Johnson Printing Co. ever do any work for Jack Ruby, to\r\nyour knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; not to my knowledge. And I can assure you that\r\nLettercraft didn't, because if it had, it would have crossed my desk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you generally aware of the jobs that went through\r\nJohnson Printing?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. That came to my press, yes sir. Now, Johnson--I don't know\r\nwhether you know it--it is a pretty good sized shop. It is one of the\r\nbiggest in Dallas. In fact, you could put my whole shop in just one\r\nroom over there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you talk about your shop you are talking about\r\nLettercraft?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; now, on the press that I was working on, nothing\r\never came in; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I think that will be all. May I look at my notes, Mr.\r\nChairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you told us in detail all your conversations with Mr.\r\nSurrey, from the time that this particular job started until it was\r\nconcluded?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he tell you at all what his purpose was?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; the only thing I mentioned--he said he had a\r\ncustomer that wanted it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He did not identify the customer?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But he indicated he was doing this for a customer?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you recall whether at the time Mr. Surrey first spoke\r\nwith you about this job, it was publicly known that President Kennedy\r\nwas to visit Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. It might have been; but not to my knowledge, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You did not know at that time that President Kennedy was\r\ngoing to visit Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And I think you have testified that your first contact with\r\nMr. Surrey about this was some 3 weeks before the visit?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Around the first of November that would be?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; now, it might have came out in the paper that\r\nMr. Kennedy was coming to Dallas, but we don't take the paper. And\r\nusually by the time we get home and feed the kids, we don't have time\r\nto read the paper anyway. We might watch the late movie on television.\r\nWe don't keep up with the news, which we should, but we don't. And\r\nthat is probably the way it got in without me knowing it. But I had no\r\nknowledge at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Klause works, does she?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you both get home about the same time do you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir--the biggest part of the time we do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How many children do you have?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. We have three.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I exhibit to you another handbill which we will mark as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1053.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1053 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For the purpose of the record, this is entitled \"Wanted for\r\nMurder,\" and it had a front view and profile of Mr. Khrushchev. It is\r\nsigned \"Minutemen\" in printing, with quotations.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen that document before or one like it?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you see any form of type there that is the kind of type\r\nthat is reproduced in Lettercraft Printing?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that appear to be any type font or printing with which\r\nyou became familiar at Johnson Printing Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; actually from a printer's viewpoint--just looking\r\nat it from this angle here--that could be done off of a typewriter.\r\nThat looks more like a typewriter than it does off a Linotype machine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And after its having been typed, then reproduced in the\r\nfashion in which Commission Exhibit No. 996 was reproduced?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The mechanical processes you have described. You called it\r\na blanket?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Plate.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Make up a plate of the whole sheet--you photograph the\r\nsheet, then make a plate, and reproduce from the plate?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow why I say it doesn't look like Linotype--in Linotype most of your\r\ncolumns or your paragraphs are butted up straight. In other words, you\r\ngot straight edges on both sides. Whereas on a typewriter you cannot\r\nflush. It takes somebody exceptionally skilled with a typewriter to\r\nflush the corners. These edges here are not flush.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are talking about the right-hand margin?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir; you see your left hand is flush. Now on a\r\nLinotype those on the right can be flushed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, directing your attention to Commission Exhibit No.\r\n996, are the right-hand margins of that material flushed as you call it?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. These I would say were pretty close to being flush. It\r\nwould be more of a Linotype than this Exhibit No. 1053 here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would lead you to believe, then, that the copy on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 996 was produced in the first instance on a\r\nLinotype machine?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Linotype or----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A Ludlow?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Possibly. I was getting ready to Varitype. Varitype would\r\ncome up close to flushing it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But Commission Exhibit No. 1053 does not stimulate your\r\nrecollection in any respect whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You never heard about that handbill?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Wholly apart from never having seen it?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. My handing it to you a moment ago was the first time you\r\never knew of the existence of a handbill of that type?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You never heard any discussion of it heretofore?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, Sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, I have covered all of the details with Mr.\r\nKlause. I have no further questions of him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no more questions. We thank you very much, Mr.\r\nKlause, for coming. We appreciate your testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. I am glad I can do what I can do. I would like to get this\r\nstraightened out. I feel real guilty about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is there anything you would like to add, Mr. Klause?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. No, sir; except that it is a mess, and that I am just a\r\npoor country boy, I guess you would say, that got caught up in the\r\nmess, and I strictly learned my lesson on this.\r\n\r\nI have hurt a bunch of people, especially my folks, and I have caused\r\na lot of trouble. I just feel real bad about it. That is all. If I had\r\ntaken time to have read the thing actually I don't think I would ever\r\nhave done it.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, it was late at night, and I was in a hurry, and I\r\nwanted to get it on and off.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you needed the money.\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. And I needed the money; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What did you net on this?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. $40. Actually, I think the stock was somewhere around $20.\r\nI paid for the stock, and he in turn paid for the stock.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. $40 was your profit on this?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. $40 was the full profit to you?\r\n\r\nMr. KLAUSE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you anything further, Mr. Jenner?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Commission will stand adjourned.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 4:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, July 2, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARK LANE RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 2 p.m., on July 2, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were: Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; and Representative\r\nGerald R. Ford, member.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; and Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, the last time you were here, we excused you as a witness. You\r\nshould be sworn again as a witness.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated, please. Mr. Rankin will ask you some\r\nquestions that were not entirely cleared up when you were here last\r\ntime. Would you proceed?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, you testified before the Commission the last time\r\non March 4, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you recall your testimony at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, it was rather long testimony. I recall portions of it;\r\nyes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes. Do you recall that you were asked about an interview\r\nwith Helen Markham?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I recall testifying to that; yes. I don't know if I was asked\r\nabout it specifically, but I do recall testifying in reference to that\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you would care to refer to your testimony at any time,\r\nyou are free to do so.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any writing from Mrs. Markham in connection\r\nwith the interview that you referred to in your testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Any document which Mrs. Markham wrote? Is that the question?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Either that or anything that she signed which purports to\r\nbe her statement or affidavit or other recording.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have nothing that she signed or that she wrote.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have anything that you made up yourself from any\r\ninterview with her?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have that with you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you describe that document? Is it a paper or a tape\r\nrecording, or what form does it have?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It is a tape recording and a transcript of the tape recording\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was the tape recording made by you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I think we are now moving into an area where I would prefer\r\nnot to answer questions, quite frankly. I have given to the Commission\r\nthe results of my investigation, and I think that the Commission are\r\naware of the fact that I have an attorney-client relationship existing.\r\nThe Commission is now asking for working papers of an attorney. The\r\nSupreme Court has been quite plain, I think, on the question of the\r\nsanctity of working documents of attorneys. And I think, therefore,\r\nthat the questions are no longer in a proper area.\r\n\r\nI might also indicate to the Commission that when I was retained by\r\nMarguerite Oswald to represent the interests of her son before this\r\nCommission, and the Commission declined to permit me to so represent\r\nLee Oswald, it made it impossible for me to conduct the kind of\r\ncross-examination before this Commission of witnesses that I would have\r\nordinarily conducted, and that entire conversation would have been in\r\nthe presence of the Commission, obviously, had I been permitted to\r\nfunction as counsel for my client.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you describe to the Commission the attorney and client\r\nrelationship that you claim to exist?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I should think the Commission would be well aware\r\nof that since I wrote to the Commission on the very day that I was\r\nretained and sent, as I recall, an affidavit from my client, detailing\r\nthe purpose, the purpose of my being retained. I think that was during\r\nthe very early days of this year.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who was the client?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Marguerite Oswald retained me to conduct an investigation in\r\nreference to the charges that were made against her son, then deceased,\r\nand to represent his interests before this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And do you claim that that attorney-client relationship is\r\none that exists now?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It does exist at the present time in relationship to a matter\r\nperipheral to this investigation. It certainly did exist at the time of\r\nmy discussion with Mrs. Markham, and my discussion with Mrs. Markham\r\ntook place solely because of the existence of that relationship and to\r\nfurther that relationship.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you state what the peripheral matter is that you\r\nreferred to?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It is the matter that Mrs. Oswald called you and spoke with\r\nyou on the telephone about yesterday, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It is in reference to a matter regarding the son of Mrs.\r\nMarkham.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell whatever else there is in regard to that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Mrs. Oswald has specifically requested that--in fact, has\r\nspecifically directed me not to discuss that matter publicly--inasmuch\r\nas you have that information--because she talked with me only after she\r\nspoke with you, Mr. Rankin. And when she did speak with me, she told\r\nme what she had told you precisely early in the day she had told me. I\r\nthink that the Commission does have that information.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you refusing to disclose it, then?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have a specific direction from Mrs. Oswald, who retained me\r\nin this peripheral matter just yesterday, not to discuss this matter\r\npublicly, sir. She is presently herself involved in investigating this\r\nmatter, and told me specifically that any publicity in reference to\r\nthis matter would be harmful to her investigation. I would otherwise\r\nbe very happy to discuss the matter with you, as I have discussed\r\neverything else quite publicly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that is your reason for not disclosing it at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; coupled with the fact that the Commission has this\r\ninformation, because I assume that Mrs. Oswald did speak with you\r\nyesterday. She told me that she did, and she gave you all the\r\ninformation she had in this regard. I believe she gave you more\r\ninformation than she gave to me, as a matter of fact, judging from what\r\nshe said to me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you claim to be acting for Mrs. Oswald on any other\r\nmatter than that in connection with her son? That is Helen Markham's\r\nson?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. At the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I am not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When did that relationship terminate?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't recall the exact date, but it was sometime after my\r\ntestimony here, which was, I believe, on the 4th of March of this year.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you fix it more precisely?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I believe it was within 2 weeks after that date. I did\r\nnot bring with me the letter that I wrote to Mrs. Oswald explaining\r\nthat I could not function before the Commission as counsel because\r\nthe Commission would not permit me to function as counsel, and that\r\nI agreed to serve on a citizen's committee which would conduct an\r\nindependent inquiry. And, therefore, since it seemed that there\r\nwas nothing further I could do on behalf of the original purpose\r\nof our retainer, that we should probably conclude our professional\r\nrelationship as of that time had ended. I believe that is the substance\r\nof the letter that I sent to Mrs. Oswald. And that is within 2 weeks of\r\nMarch 4.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Rankin, may I raise a question about the\r\nlanguage which Mr. Lane uses to the effect that the Commission declined\r\nto permit Mr. Lane to represent Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nI think the record before the Commission on this matter will speak for\r\nitself. I think to have the record clear, we ought to have that part of\r\nthe Commission proceedings inserted in the record at this point.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would like to correct a mistake that you made, Congressman.\r\nI did not say that I was not permitted to serve as counsel for Mrs.\r\nOswald before the Commission. I said, I thought quite precisely, that\r\nI had not been permitted by the Commission to serve as counsel to\r\nrepresent the interests of Lee Harvey Oswald at the request of his\r\nmother, Marguerite Oswald.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think we should let the record speak for itself\r\nat the time that this matter was raised before the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That portion of the record may be incorporated in this\r\nrecord at this particular time.\r\n\r\n    Mr. LANE. I would just like to conclude on this note.\r\n\r\n    I hope the Commission will give consideration to my request, which\r\n    the Commission has answered, but which again I would like at this\r\n    time to renew. That is, that I be permitted, at the request of Mrs.\r\n    Oswald, the mother of the accused, defendant, really, before this\r\n    Commission's hearing, to represent his interests here, to have\r\n    access to the material which you have access to, and the right to\r\n    present witnesses.\r\n\r\n    It is not usual for an attorney representing a party to be given\r\n    an opportunity to testify, which is quite unusual--but rather to\r\n    be given the opportunity to present witnesses and to cross-examine\r\n    them. It has generally been my role in criminal cases. Never before\r\n    have I testified in behalf of a client.\r\n\r\n    If it is the Commissioners' position that this is not a trial in\r\n    any respect, and therefore Oswald is not entitled to counsel, that\r\n    is the position with which I would like to respectfully offer a\r\n    dissent.\r\n\r\n    The fact that Oswald is not going to have a real trial flows only\r\n    from his death, and he is not responsible with that having taken\r\n    place. Every right belonging to an American citizen charged with a\r\n    crime was taken from him up to and including his life.\r\n\r\n    I think now that that episode is completed, hopefully never to\r\n    reappear ever again in our history, or anything close to it--I\r\n    think it would be proper to permit him to have counsel before the\r\n    Commission, counsel who can function on his behalf in terms of\r\n    cross-examining evidence and presenting witnesses. If it is the\r\n    Commission's position now that he is entitled to counsel, and the\r\n    Commission will appoint counsel, then I ask the Commission to\r\n    consider that the constitutional right to counsel involves the\r\n    right to counsel of one's choice, or in the event of the death of\r\n    a party, to counsel of the choice of the surviving members of the\r\n    family.\r\n\r\n    If Marina Oswald, the widow, sought to have counsel represent\r\n    her husband I would think--here--I would think that would cause\r\n    a conflict and a problem, if the widow and also the mother made\r\n    the same request. But as I understand it no request has been made\r\n    by the widow, who has indicated to the press that she believes\r\n    her husband is guilty, and through her former business agent, Mr.\r\n    Martin, who I am told was secured for her by the Secret Service\r\n    as a business agent, she indicated that even a trial which might\r\n    prove he was innocent, she would still be sure he was guilty, and\r\n    has indicated since that time no desire to my knowledge to secure\r\n    counsel for her husband, her late husband, before the Commission.\r\n\r\n    I think, then, the mother would, in almost any jurisdiction, be the\r\n    next person to make a decision in this area, and the mother has\r\n    made a decision, as you know. She has retained me to represent the\r\n    rights and interests of her son.\r\n\r\n    I think under those circumstances it would be proper for the\r\n    Commission to permit me to participate.\r\n\r\n    This, of course, is not a jury trial. With all due respect to the\r\n    integrity and background of each of the members of the Commission,\r\n    I suggest that it is not the function of the trying body to appoint\r\n    counsel, or the jury to appoint counsel, but in our society it\r\n    is just the reverse; it is the function of defense counsel to\r\n    participate in determining who the jury should be.\r\n\r\n    Many criminal lawyers, very noted counsel, would probably seek to\r\n    excuse certain--and again no disrespect at all is meant to the\r\n    background of members of this Commission--but defense counsel\r\n    generally seeks to excuse as jurors those who are in any way\r\n    associated with the Government in a criminal case. And here we\r\n    have the Government appointing the jury, and then the jury picking\r\n    counsel, who also is Government connected at this time. I in no\r\n    way wish to raise the question of the integrity of any of the\r\n    members of the Commission or counsel or anyone else, or their\r\n    ability. But that truism about equality has some meaning in terms\r\n    of impartiality--everyone is impartial to some people, and more\r\n    impartial to other people. And counsel, in order to function, I\r\n    believe, must be totally independent and totally committed to the\r\n    responsibility of representing his client.\r\n\r\n    But above all, he must be secured by someone who has the ability to\r\n    speak for the deceased, in this case his mother and his wife. And\r\n    under those circumstances, I renew my request that I be permitted\r\n    to, at the request of Lee Oswald's mother, who survives him--to\r\n    function before this Commission as counsel on his behalf.\r\n\r\n    The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, I must advise you that the Commission, as\r\n    you already know, has considered your request and has denied it. It\r\n    does not consider you as the attorney for Lee Oswald. Now, this is\r\n    not for any discussion. We are not going to argue it. You have had\r\n    your say, and I will just answer.\r\n\r\n    Lee Oswald left a widow. She is his legal representative. She is\r\n    represented by counsel. This Commission is cooperating with her\r\n    in any way she may request. If anyone else wants to present any\r\n    evidence to the Commission, they may do so. But it is the view and\r\n    the wish--the will of the Commission--that no one else shall be\r\n    entitled to participate in the work and the deliberations of the\r\n    Commission.\r\n\r\n    We asked you to come here today because we understood that you\r\n    did have evidence. We are happy to receive it. We want every bit\r\n    of evidence that you have. You may present anything that you wish\r\n    to us. But you are not to be a participant in the work of the\r\n    Commission. I assume you have some questions you would like to ask\r\n    Mr. Lane, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, then I ask also, Mr. Chief Justice, at this point the\r\nletters, exchange of letters between Mr. Rankin and myself, where I\r\nmade the request to appear as counsel for the interests of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, and where counsel for this Commission said that, Oswald was not\r\nentitled to counsel, or that I could not represent him----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Let the record speak for itself in that respect, too. The\r\nexchange of letters will be in the record. [See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1053.]\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, Mr. Lane, regarding this tape recording of Helen\r\nMarkham, and your interview with her, will you tell the Commission when\r\nyou made this?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I had a conversation with Mrs. Markham on the 2d day of March\r\nof this year.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have given the Commission the results of that investigation\r\nto the best of my ability. I think that, again, Mr. Rankin, your\r\nquestion delves into the functioning of an attorney on behalf of a\r\nclient, and, therefore, is not proper, and, therefore, I decline to\r\nanswer it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell the Commission when you made the tape\r\nrecording that you referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I just answered that question, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And do you refuse to tell, then, anything about that\r\ninterview with Helen Markham, how you recorded it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And how you recorded it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I should think that since this Commission has been appointed\r\nby the President of the United States to secure all of the information\r\nregarding the assassination of President Kennedy and other matters\r\nperipheral to that, the questions asked of me should be related to\r\ninformation which can be of assistance to the Commission, and should\r\nnot be the kind of questions, Mr. Rankin, that you have put to me.\r\n\r\nI am happy to tell you every bit of information that I have been able\r\nto secure as a private citizen in trying to discover what took place on\r\nNovember 22 and the days that followed November 22, but I think that\r\nthe very questions that you are putting to me indicates that you are\r\nnot interested solely in securing that information, but in placing me,\r\nMr. Rankin, in a position which is not a good one. And I see this quite\r\nfrankly as part of many things that have happened to me since November\r\n22--not November 22, but since I expressed some interest in this case.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, could you tell us whether there was anyone else\r\npresent at this interview with Helen Markham that you recorded?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't believe that I said I recorded it. I believe I said\r\nit was recorded.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was it recorded by someone else?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I decline to answer any questions, because the questions you\r\nare asking clearly are not for the purpose for which this Commission\r\nhas been established. And I tell you that I am amazed, quite frankly,\r\nMr. Rankin, that the kind of harassment to which I have been subjected\r\nsince I became involved in this case continues here in this room--I am\r\namazed by that.\r\n\r\nAs you know, and I don't know if this has been placed on the record by\r\nthe Commission--in the letter that I wrote to you on May 18, 1964, I\r\ntold you that I had been accosted by two agents of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation in front of my own house, and ordered to give to them,\r\nby them--their names being William E. Folkner, his serial number being\r\n5954, and John P. Dimarchi, his serial number being 4256--and ordered\r\nto give to those gentlemen documents in my possession, relating to my\r\ntestimony before this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I did not give them those documents; no.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Why not?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Does your tone and your question indicate you think I should\r\nhave given those documents to agents of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I would like to have you answer the question, if you would.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. You decline to answer my question?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; I am examining you.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Of course, I did not give them any documents in my\r\npossession. When I deal with any agencies of the Government, I expect\r\nthat they will write to me, and if they wish to secure information from\r\nme they will do that in a dignified manner. I am an attorney with an\r\noffice in New York. I don't expect to be accosted in front of my house\r\nby agents of the police, Federal, State, or local authorities. Those\r\nare the actions not of a democratic society, but of a police state,\r\nand I decline to believe for one moment that we live in a society\r\nwhere that behavior is going to be countenanced by any members of this\r\nCommission or by counsel to this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you offer to furnish them copies if they would write to\r\nyou in the manner you suggested?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I suggested to those two agents that someone in the office of\r\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation might write to me and that I would\r\nrespond courteously, and make available whatever information I could. I\r\ntold them, also, as I told you, since I wrote a letter to you covering\r\nthis entire matter on May 18th--I told them also that I had testified\r\nfully before this Commission. If they wanted to secure any information\r\nI had, they might contact the Commission. They indicated they were not\r\ninterested in the Warren Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, to return to the tape recording----\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would like to add one more point, if I may. It is a matter\r\nwhich I discussed with you on the telephone 2 days ago.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that in regard to the tape recording?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; it is not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can we confine ourselves to that for a bit, until we\r\ncomplete that. Can you tell us who else was present at the time of this\r\ntape recording of Helen Markham that you describe?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would like to make this quite clear to you, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nI am not going to discuss any working papers in my possession. Those\r\npapers came into my possession as a result of an attorney-client\r\nrelationship. The Supreme Court has written decisions regarding the\r\nsanctity of those documents. I think it is improper of you to ask\r\nquestions which delve into relationship of that nature. And I think you\r\nknow that the questions you are asking are improper.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And if other people were present at the time of any such\r\nmatters and disclosures, does that make any difference under the law,\r\ndo you think?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Present where?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At the time of the tape recording and the interview. That\r\nis what I am asking you.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No one else was present.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And who did the tape recording?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Again you are delving into an area which is an improper one\r\nfor you to delve into.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you know about the tape recording being made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you know about the tape recording being made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I decline to answer that question.\r\n\r\nAm I a defendant before this Commission, or is the Commission trying to\r\nfind out who assassinated the President?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. We are trying to find out information about a\r\nwitness before this Commission----\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, then, call the witness before the Commission and ask\r\nthe witness questions. And if the Commission--if the witness has\r\ntestified contrary to what I say the witness has said, then I would\r\nsuggest you do what I invited the Commission to do when this matter\r\narose. Submit my testimony and Mrs. Markham's testimony to the U.S.\r\nattorney's office, and bring an action against both of us for perjury.\r\nAnd then at that trial I will present documents in my possession, and\r\nwe will see who is convicted.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you believe Mrs. Markham is an important\r\nwitness in this overall matter?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would think so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am sure you know what she has told you.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I know what she has told me, that is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If there is any difference between what she told\r\nyou and told this Commission, is that important?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Of course, it is important. And if there was someone\r\nrepresenting the interests of Oswald before this Commission, there\r\ncould be cross-examination, you sitting as judges could then base your\r\ndecision upon the cross-examination. But you have decided instead\r\nto sit as judges and jurors and defense attorneys and prosecuting\r\nattorneys, and you are faced with a dilemma. I cannot solve that\r\ndilemma for you.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In order for us to evaluate the testimony she\r\nhas given us and what you allege she has given you, we must see the\r\ninformation which you have at your disposal.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have told you precisely under oath what Mrs. Markham has\r\nsaid to me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you unwilling to verify that with the tape recording\r\nthat you claim to have?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am unable to verify that because of an existing\r\nattorney-client relationship, and you know that it would be improper\r\nand unethical for me to give the answers to the questions which you\r\nare asking. And that is why I am amazed that you persist in asking\r\nquestions which you know are improper and which would be unethical for\r\nme to answer.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And where was this tape recording made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. You have my answer to questions about that already, Mr.\r\nRankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you, yourself, have any conversation with Helen Markham\r\nat anytime?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I testified to that on March 4, and again today.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this tape recording of that conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Precisely.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us where the tape recording was made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I can tell you, but I will not tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any other reasons for not disclosing this\r\ninformation to the Commission except your statement about the attorney\r\nand client relationship that you describe?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. And the sanctity of working documents of an attorney. I have\r\nno other reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, the Commission has asked you a number of times to\r\ndisclose to it the name of the informant that you said told you about\r\nhaving seen certain persons in the Carousel Club. Are you ready to\r\ndisclose the name of that informant now?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am ready, but as I told you when I gave you that\r\ninformation at the outset, I gave my word of honor to that person\r\nthat I would not disclose his name unless he gave me permission to. I\r\nhave gone to Dallas on two separate occasions to try to secure that\r\npermission. I have not been able to secure that permission. Nothing\r\nwould make me happier than giving you the name of that person; but I\r\nhave given my word of honor and, therefore, I am unable to give you\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you claim any attorney and client relationship with\r\nregard to the name of that informant?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I think there clearly exists an attorney-client relationship,\r\nbut that is not the motivating factor in my telling you that I will not\r\ndisclose the name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the basis for your refusal to disclose the name?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Obviously if I say yes, you cannot pursue this, but I must\r\ntell you honestly that is not the reason.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then I ask you to disclose the name of the informant.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I cannot. I have given my word to that person that I would\r\nnot disclose his name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know that is no legal justification, do you not?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I know that is true. There is no legal justification. I know\r\nthat I am not here under subpena. I know that you wrote to me while I\r\nwas in Europe, although you have the power of subpena--you do not have\r\nthe power to subpena me while I was in Europe. I know the Commission\r\nwill complete its work very likely within the next 2 weeks. I could\r\nhave easily remained in Europe until the Commission had completed its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI knew you were calling me here today in reference to that specific\r\nmatter because you said so in your letter to me. So I have come here\r\nvoluntarily to cooperate with the Commission to the very best of my\r\nability, and not to rely upon any legal superstructure to protect my\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nI told this Commission at the outset that I had given my word to this\r\nperson, and I would not reveal his name. The Commission led me to\r\nbelieve at that time that it would honor that understanding, and the\r\nrecord, I think, so reveals that. If the Commission is prepared----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You base that upon the record at that time? You base your\r\nclaim that the Commission indicated that it would honor any such\r\nunderstanding on the record that was made on March 4, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I think there is language there which indicates this. I\r\nwas not pressed at that time. We discussed the matter at that time. If\r\nthe Commission is at this point about to reverse its position, despite\r\nan indication that it would honor that understanding, I am myself not\r\nready to break my honor, my commitment to that individual. I have not\r\ndone that ever in the past, and I will not do that now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The Commission has a number of times asked you by\r\ncorrespondence to disclose the name of that informant, and it now\r\nasks you in this proceeding, while you are under oath, to make that\r\ndisclosure.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I will not do so, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you realize that the information you gave in closed\r\nsession could have an unfavorable effect upon your country's interests\r\nin connection with this assassination and your failure to disclose the\r\nname of your informant would do further injury?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Mr. Rankin. I am astonished to hear that statement from you.\r\nThere are 180 million Americans in this country. I am perhaps the\r\nonly one who is a private citizen who has taken off the last 6 months\r\nto devote all of his efforts to securing whatever information can be\r\nfound, and to making that known to this Commission, and publicly to\r\nthe people of this country at great personal cost in terms of the\r\nharassment that I have suffered, in terms of the terrible financial\r\nlosses that I have suffered. And to sit here today, after 6 months of\r\nthis work, which I have given all to this Commission, voluntarily,\r\nand again have come here again today voluntarily to give you this\r\ninformation, and to hear you say that I am not cooperating with the\r\nCommission, and I am going to do harm to the country by not making\r\ninformation available to you astonishes me.\r\n\r\nYou have hundreds of agents of the FBI running all over the Dallas\r\narea--agents of the Secret Service, Dallas policemen. Are you telling\r\nme that in one trip to Dallas where I spent something like 2 days, I\r\nuncovered information which the whole police force of this Nation has\r\nnot yet in 6 months been able to secure? I cannot believe that is a\r\nvalid assessment of this situation. I cannot, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, may I say to you that until you give us the\r\ncorroboration that you say you have, namely, that someone told you that\r\nthat was a fact, we have every reason to doubt the truthfulness of what\r\nyou have heretofore told us. And your refusal to answer at this time\r\nlends further strength to that belief. If you can tell us, and if you\r\nwill tell us, who gave you that information, so that we may test their\r\nveracity, then you have performed a service to this Commission. But\r\nuntil you do, you have done nothing but handicap us.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have handicapped you by working for 6 months and making\r\nall of the information which I have had available to you? I understand\r\nvery fully your position, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, what did you come down to tell us or inform\r\nthe Commission about? You say you came here of your own volition in\r\norder to help us, and to give us information. Now, what information\r\nin light of the fact that I wrote you and asked you for two specific\r\nthings--whatever information you had in any recorded form concerning\r\nyour interview with Helen Markham, and secondly, the name of the\r\ninformant, neither of which you are willing to disclose or have said\r\nanything to help the Commission on.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I came here at your request that I interrupt my trip in\r\nEurope to come back and testify before you. And I have done that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. By denying--by refusing to answer either question.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I think that--well. I have given you the reasons why I cannot\r\nanswer the question. With reference to Mrs. Markham, I should tell you\r\nthis, that I am hopeful that in the very near future I will be able\r\nto make that document available to you by securing permission from my\r\nclient. But she has informed me at the present time that she is herself\r\ninvolved in securing some information relative to this whole matter,\r\nwhich you are familiar with, Mr. Rankin, and that she wishes there to\r\nbe no discussion at all at this point about this matter.\r\n\r\nFrankly, quite frankly, matters which have been given to this\r\nCommission in utmost confidence have appeared in the daily newspapers,\r\nand one cannot feel with great security that giving information to this\r\nCommission, even at secret hearings, means that the information will\r\nnot be broadcast, and this is the problem which confronts us at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You know, do you not, that you and other witnesses have\r\nbeen free to discuss their testimony before the Commission with the\r\npublic, and you, yourself, have done that, and that is one of the\r\nreasons that things that were said before the Commission have been\r\ndivulged. You, yourself, have discussed fully your testimony before the\r\npress and the radio and the television.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Other witnesses have done the same thing. No witness is\r\nunder compulsion to keep his testimony secret. Naturally, some things\r\nwould come out.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, it seems to me that when the transcript of my--the\r\ntranscript of my testimony was sent to me, dealing with the portion in\r\nexecutive session, every page had been marked \"Top Secret.\" In fact,\r\nit bore a legend across it saying that my testimony, which consisted\r\nalmost solely at the outset of my request that the hearings be open to\r\nthe public, was in fact related to the national defense of the United\r\nStates and it was a violation of the espionage laws for me to discuss\r\nthose matters publicly.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Mr. Lane, you know that you came right down from\r\nyour testimony, and I think in this very room, or at least on this\r\nfloor of this same building, discussed your testimony with the press\r\nand the radio and the television.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Oh, I most certainly did. My testimony was open to the\r\npublic. My testimony was unlike the rest of the testimony before the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, now, that is your judgment. Every witness knows\r\nthat he is under no compulsion to keep his testimony secret. They have\r\nnot done it. And many of them have come down here after their testimony\r\nupstairs and have appeared on radio and television and have discussed\r\nmatters with the press.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I know that that may very well be so, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\nI was only making reference to matters such as the diary which has been\r\nmarked Top Secret, which has been published, and the press conferences\r\nin which members of the Commission reported to the press the testimony\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, when I wrote you, do you recall that I offered to\r\nhave the Commission pay your expenses to come back from Europe in order\r\nto testify before the Commission at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; you did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you asking that you be paid those expenses?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would expect that since you made that offer that is a\r\ncommitment you should keep. I would have remained in Europe; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you did not tell me in any correspondence that you were\r\ngoing to take the position that you could not make this disclosure\r\nbecause of an attorney-client relationship, and that you were not going\r\nto give us any information about the informant at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Mr. Rankin----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; of course I told you that. I told you that on March 4,\r\nand I have told you that in every letter which you have written to\r\nme on these questions. I cannot understand how you can pretend to be\r\nsurprised or plead surprise at this point based upon my position before\r\nthe Commission which today, in July, is consistently the same position\r\nI took in March, and consistently the same position I took in the\r\nintervening months when I wrote to you, we exchanged correspondence, in\r\nrelationship to my position.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you did not in answer to my letter, when I offered\r\nto pay your expenses, say that the only thing you could testify to\r\nwas that there was an attorney-client relationship and you would not\r\nproduce any of the records in regard to Helen Markham because of that,\r\nor you did not say that you would not give us the name of the informant\r\nbecause you had refused to disclose it, in answer to my letter,\r\noffering to pay your expenses. You said nothing about anything of that\r\nkind, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I never received your letter. You wrote it to my New York\r\naddress. I was in Europe traveling at the time. I received a phone call\r\nfrom my office 3 days ago stating that you had asked that I return to\r\nthe United States to testify, and I immediately booked passage the\r\nnext morning, which was the first plane, in order to return, and to\r\nbe here before July 1, which was what your letter said. When I came\r\nback, I received a phone call from you indicating that I was not needed\r\nyesterday, but that today at 2 o'clock would be the appropriate time,\r\nand so I came here today. And I am willing to----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that your answer?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; of course, it is my answer. I will give you all of the\r\ninformation in my possession in reference to everything I have been\r\nable to discover in order to assist this Commission. But what you are\r\nasking at this point are sources. You are not asking for information.\r\nYou are asking for sources. And you know that it is improper to ask for\r\nthose sources.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Even where there is no relationship of attorney and\r\nclient?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It is not improper because there is a relationship in that\r\ncase. It is improper because I gave that testimony to you voluntarily\r\non March 4, explaining to the members of this Commission that I had\r\ngiven my word of honor to this person not to disclose his name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have anything else that you wish to disclose in\r\naddition to such disclosures as you now have made to the Commission in\r\nregard to the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. There are three additional matters which have come to my\r\nattention, which I am not at this point able to disclose because an\r\ninvestigation is still being conducted in Dallas. But by Monday,\r\nthis coming Monday, I will be in a position to make that information\r\navailable to you. In addition to that----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will this be in written form, signed statements and\r\naffidavits, or what will you have for this?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't understand your question, Mr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you have it in any kind of a written form; the\r\nadditional testimony or evidence that you refer to?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I cannot tell you that until Monday. In addition to that, as\r\nI told you when we spoke on the phone 2 days ago, and you suggested\r\nthat I raise this matter before the Commission, I am deeply concerned\r\nabout the fact that since I have become involved in this matter,\r\nand since I testified before this Commission, the U.S. Department\r\nof Immigration has placed my name in their immigration book, on the\r\nproscribed list, and that when I returned to this country, in response\r\nto your invitation to come here and testify before this Commission, I\r\nwas halted by the immigration authorities because my name appeared in\r\nthat proscribed list.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And I told you at that time on the telephone, didn't I,\r\nthat the Commission had nothing to do with that? Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. You did tell me that, and I ask you if you would be good\r\nenough to find out, since I did not accuse the Commission of having\r\nmy name listed there, of course--to find out if my name was listed in\r\nrelationship to the inquiry which I have conducted, and the testimony\r\nthat I have given to this Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Were you prevented from entering the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I am here now, Mr. Chief Justice, but I was stopped.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How long were you detained? Were you detained?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Oh, just for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How many minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Oh, perhaps 5. My objection is not to the period of time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. What was the question asked of you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Just to wait.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Wasn't there something else asked of you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, perhaps I should, then, tell you what happened.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All right. You better answer that question of the Chief\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is a part of my question. I asked you: What did they\r\nsay to you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, there were three different persons. The first person\r\nwas at the desk, whose name I do not recall, but as an immigration\r\ninspector said, \"Kindly wait,\" and he returned within 5 minutes and\r\ngave me back my passport and said, \"You can pass through now.\" So not\r\na single question was asked of me by the immigration inspector who\r\ndiscovered that my name was in the proscribed book.\r\n\r\nI, however, asked him if he could tell me why my name was in the book,\r\nand he said that it was confidential material which he could not reveal\r\nto me, and I asked him if he would be good enough to tell me the name\r\nof his superior officer so that I might discuss the matter with him. He\r\nreferred me to Mr. J. J. Daley, also an immigration inspector, and Mr.\r\nDaley asked me if perhaps I had gone to Cuba, and I said to him I had\r\nnever been to Cuba; I had only been out of the country where a passport\r\nwas required twice in my life, both within the last 6 months. The only\r\ntime prior to then I had left the country was when I was a soldier in\r\nthe U.S. Army, and I was sent to Europe--not to Cuba at that time.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Well, then, I can't understand it.\" And I asked if I could\r\nsee his superior officer. And he referred me to W. T. McArnity, who\r\nwas the officer in charge. He told me that perhaps there was just some\r\nmistake made, but could give me no further information. He referred\r\nme to Mr. Espardy, who is the district director, I believe, of the\r\nImmigration Department, and Mr. Espardy said merely, \"I am not going to\r\ntell you a thing.\" That is where the entire matter rested, and where it\r\nrests now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, when you asked your informant if you could\r\ndisclose the information that we have asked you about--and we have\r\nasked you the name of the informer--did you tell him that the\r\nCommission had indicated to you that his name would not be publicly\r\nrevealed if he would allow you to disclose it to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I most certainly did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And what was his response?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He wondered whether that meant his name might not be revealed\r\nanywhere--if not by the members of the Commission, perhaps somehow it\r\nmight be revealed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That is precisely what he said.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. When I spoke with him; I think it was during March or April\r\nof this year, after I testified before the Commission.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you made any further inquiry in that regard?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Have I?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I spoke with him one more time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Since your return from Europe?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I just arrived 2 days ago.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was the last time you spoke to him about disclosing\r\nhis name?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would think it was during April of this year.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When in April?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't recall the exact date. When I was last in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you give us a closer approximation than that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I really cannot. I believe it was in April; perhaps toward\r\nthe middle of April, but I am not certain.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it by telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I saw him in person. I went down to see him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You saw him in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; well, near Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you consider, Mr. Lane, that you have cooperated with\r\nthe Commission as much as you can in regard to both of these matters,\r\nHelen Markham and this informant?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I think there is no question but that I have. Frankly,\r\nwhen I returned to the country, I had thought that it would be not\r\ndifficult for me to make available to you all the documents regarding\r\nMrs. Markham. I had planned to do that.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I felt that I would be able to be released from the\r\nattorney-client stricture so that I could do that. It was not until\r\nafter I returned that I received a phone call from Mrs. Oswald, after\r\nshe called you, related this new development in relationship to the\r\nMarkhams, which has at this point handicapped my being able to secure\r\npermission to release that information. I had intended to do that.\r\n\r\nI am hopeful that in the next few days it will be possible to give you\r\nthat information, as I said earlier.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, you told us what your attorney relationship\r\nwas, but, really, I did not understand it very clearly. Will you tell\r\nus what your present attorney relationship is that causes you to rely\r\nupon it in refusing to tell us about this recording that was made at\r\nthe time of the conversation between you and Helen Markham?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't have a present attorney-client relationship in\r\nrelation to that particular matter. I, at that time, had been retained\r\nby Marguerite Oswald to investigate the charges against her son and\r\nperipheral matters, and, in conformity and in furtherance of that\r\nretainer, I conducted an interview with Mrs. Markham.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And----\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. And that is one of the working documents in my possession.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How does that become a peripheral matter--the\r\nconversation that you had with Mrs. Markham? What does that have to do\r\nwith Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I secured that information on behalf of an attorney-client\r\nrelationship when I was serving my client, Mrs. Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But, Mr. Lane, you at that very time, when you claimed to\r\nbe, and when you were, the attorney for Mrs. Oswald, you did come here\r\nand testify concerning that conversation with Mrs. Markham.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. NOW, if you testified concerning it then, why can't\r\nyou now tell us all the circumstances surrounding that? Why is your\r\nprivilege any different now than it was then?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I explained to Mrs. Oswald that I had been called to testify\r\nbefore the Commission as a witness, and that the information which I\r\nhad secured I had secured on her behalf, and discussed with her what\r\nit is I was going to tell the Commission, and she agreed and gave me\r\npermission to testify before the Commission as I did.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And since that time she instructed you not to testify?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Since that time, just actually 2 days ago--or perhaps it\r\nwas yesterday--she instructed me not to discuss the entire Markham\r\nsituation at all, quite specifically, and quite strongly, and\r\ninsistently, over my objection.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is it your position, then, that you have a right to\r\ndisclose part of the information about the Helen Markham matter to the\r\nCommission and you don't have a duty to disclose all of it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I think that when one has a client, one has the right, if\r\none secures the permission of the client, to release the results\r\nof investigation while retaining the sanctity of working documents\r\nbelonging to an attorney; yes.\r\n\r\nI think there is a clear distinction.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It is your contention you can hold back part of it so that\r\nthe Commission then is not able to verify what you do tell, the part\r\nyou do tell?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, of course----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that your position?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No, and I haven't said anything, I think, even comparable to\r\nthat. I said one can testify if one has permission of the client in\r\nterms of the result of an investigation conducted by a client.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Your conclusion about the testimony? Is that what you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Not my conclusion. The result of the investigation, the\r\nresult of inquiry. But at the same time it does not mean that an\r\nattorney's working documents are no longer sanctified documents.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. About the same matter; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Of course, about the same matter. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any law to support that position?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That an attorney's working documents----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can be withheld about a matter that he purports to give\r\ntestimony concerning?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have not researched the question; no. Do you have law\r\nindicating that is inaccurate?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think it is quite inaccurate. If you come before any\r\nbody, the Commission or any court, and purport to disclose part of a\r\nmatter, I know of no law that permits you to withhold the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, it is not a question of disclosing part of a matter.\r\nThere is a conclusion of an investigation. For example, I assume\r\nthat this Commission will report its conclusions, but they may not\r\nnecessarily report every portion of the working documents before this\r\nCommission, because these are two separate areas. One is a conclusion,\r\nand one is the working documents. I have reported the conclusion,\r\nbut that does not mean, in my view, that the working documents of an\r\nattorney, therefore, are no longer privileged.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What you purported to report was what you said was her\r\ntestimony in regard to these incidents, was it not?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It was not her testimony. It was a statement that she made to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Her statement she made to you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You purported to give that to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I did give it to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And then you said you had a recording of it; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are not----\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't think I ever said that to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You are saying it now, are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I am saying it now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you are not willing to have the Commission have the\r\nrecording to check the accuracy of your report about what the testimony\r\nor statement was, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am not in a position to give you that document. I have said\r\nthat several times; yes, sir. I don't understand why it is not possible\r\nto call Mrs. Markham and to call me and to have us confront each other.\r\nI think clearly the Commission would then secure the facts. I would be\r\nhappy to participate in such a confrontation. It seems to me to be the\r\norder----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Wouldn't you then be violating your attorney-client\r\nprivilege just the same?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I don't have such a privilege--a relationship at the\r\npresent time. That relationship terminated, as I said, in March.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, you would freely discuss, though, the things that\r\noccurred while the attorney-client privilege did prevail, or did exist?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I would merely ask Mrs. Markham a series of questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Oh, yes; you would like to make the inquisition your own,\r\nbut you are unwilling to testify before this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't think that an effort to represent a man who is\r\nbeing tried in absentia, after he was killed in the custody of\r\npolice officers, is the same as asking for permission to conduct an\r\ninquisition, with all due respect to you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, you have manifested a great interest in Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and his relationship to this entire affair. According to\r\nyou, Mrs. Markham made a statement that would bear upon the probability\r\nof his guilt or innocence in connection with the assassination. Mrs\r\nMarkham has definitely contradicted what you have said, and do you\r\nnot believe that it is in your own interest and in the interests of\r\nthis country for you to give whatever corroboration you have to this\r\nCommission so that we may determine whether you or she is telling the\r\ntruth?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have given you all the information that I am permitted to\r\ngive to you and to members of the Commission. I understand from Mr.\r\nRankin that Mrs. Markham denies that she ever talked with me. Is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You needn't ask Mr. Rankin any questions. You won't\r\nanswer the questions of this Commission, and he is not under\r\nexamination by you at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have answered questions. I spoke for about 85 pages,\r\nwithout a single question being put to me, because I was anxious to\r\ngive to this Commission all the information in my possession.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, but you did not give us all the information. You did\r\nnot tell us that you had a recording of what Mrs. Markham said to you.\r\nNow, we ask you for verification of that conversation, because she has\r\ncontradicted you. You say that you have a recording, but you refuse to\r\ngive it to this Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am not in a position to give you that recording. I have\r\nmade that quite plain. Because of a matter which has arisen in the last\r\n3 or 4 days, which I was made aware of yesterday for the first time, I\r\nam not in a position to do that. Hopefully, I will be in a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We heard that when you were here in March--hopefully you\r\nwould be able to tell us who this informant of yours was in Dallas\r\nconcerning the so-called meeting between Jack Ruby and others in his\r\nnightclub. And we have been pursuing you ever since with letters and\r\nentreaties to give us that information so that we might verify what\r\nyou have said, if it is a fact, or disproving it if it is not a fact.\r\nHere we pay your expenses from Europe, bring you over here, and without\r\ntelling us at all that you won't answer that question, you come before\r\nthe Commission and refuse to testify. Do you consider that cooperation?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe I am the only citizen in this\r\ncountry who has devoted 6 months to securing information at his own\r\nexpense. You talk about what it cost to go to Europe. I have gone to\r\nEurope twice, and I have paid for those trips myself. I have traveled\r\nall over this country. I have gone to Dallas five times. I have paid\r\nfor those trips myself, and I am not in a position financially to do\r\nthat, but I have done that to give you this information.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Were you getting evidence over in Europe?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I was discussing this case, because of the suppression\r\nin this country of the facts. I felt it important that somehow the\r\nAmerican people be informed about what is taking place, and I found\r\nthat practically the only way to inform the American people is to speak\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you charged admission for any of your speaking?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Have I charged admission?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I have not charged admission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you collect any money in this country at the speeches\r\nthat you made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Did I, personally, collect any money?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you have money collected?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I collected no money.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you have any money collected?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I did not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Was there money collected at that meeting--at those\r\nmeetings that you had?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I spoke at probably 40 different college campuses throughout\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Was money collected at those places?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. To my knowledge, at none of those meetings was money\r\ncollected. At one or two or perhaps three other meetings, funds have\r\nbeen collected for the purpose of paying the salary of the secretary of\r\nthis citizens committee of inquiry, and to pay the rent.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who got the money?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The citizens committee of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who is the head of that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am the chairman of that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Who else belongs to it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Among others, Jessica Mitford, who is the author who wrote\r\n\"The American Way of Death,\" a best-selling book; Sterling Hayden, who\r\nis an actor; a number of attorneys, some in California, some in New\r\nYork; and a number of others. I did not know that I was going to be\r\nquestioned about the makeup of the citizens committee. Otherwise, I\r\nwould have brought the entire membership list.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I didn't intend to ask you, but we are trying to get\r\ninformation about these different things that you considered vital\r\nin the assassination of the President. And it is a matter of great\r\nconcern to the Commission that you are unwilling to tell us about those\r\nthings that you considered bear upon the guilt or innocence of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald. And it handicaps us greatly in what we are trying to\r\ndo, because of the things that you do say when you are away from the\r\nCommission, and then when you refuse to testify before us as to those\r\nvery things that you discuss in public.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have not said anything in public, Mr. Chief Justice, that I\r\nhave not said first before this Commission, or at one time before this\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But, before your audiences, do you not claim to be\r\ntelling the truth and to be verifying the things that you tell them,\r\nand then when you come here you refuse to give us the verification?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. When I speak before an audience, I do hold myself out to be\r\ntelling the truth, just as when I have testified before this Commission\r\nI have also told the truth.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, you expressed a desire in your telegram to\r\nexamine the rifle. We have that here for you to see. Let the record\r\nshow that at this time the Commission is giving Mr. Lane an opportunity\r\nto examine the rifle known as Commission Exhibit No. 139.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you. May I comment upon the examination?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; you may; if you saw anything of any significance\r\nthere, you may state it.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I would like to call to the attention of the Commission\r\nthe affidavit signed by a police officer, Seymour Weitzman, dated the\r\n23d day of November 1963, the original of which was at one time in the\r\noffice of the district attorney of Dallas. In that document, Officer\r\nWeitzman states he found, along with another person--a deputy sheriff,\r\nI believe, or a deputy of some sort--the alleged murder weapon, on the\r\n22d day of November 1963, on the sixth floor of the Book Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nAnd in that affidavit Mr. Weitzman--Officer Weitzman--swears that the\r\nmurder weapon which he found, or the weapon which he found on that\r\nfloor, was a Mauser 7.65 millimeters. A Mauser, of course, is a German\r\nweapon. The rifle which is before the Commission, and which is, I\r\nassume, allegedly now the murder weapon, is, of course, not a German\r\nMauser 7.65 millimeters, but is an Italian carbine, 6.5 millimeters.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am personally not a rifle expert, I was able to determine\r\nthat it was an Italian carbine because printed indelibly upon it\r\nare the words \"Made Italy\" and \"caliber 6.5.\" I suggest it is very\r\ndifficult for a police officer to pick up a weapon which has printed\r\nupon it clearly in English \"Made Italy, Cal 6.5,\" and then the next day\r\ndraft an affidavit stating that that was in fact a German Mauser, 7.65\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. Anything further? We will take a short recess,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n(Brief recess.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, the Commission will come to order. There is\r\nnothing further at this time. The meeting is adjourned.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 3:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n    _Washington, July 10, 1964_.\r\n\r\n    The Honorable EARL WARREN,\r\n    _The Chief Justice of the United States,\r\n    Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CHIEF JUSTICE: I have attempted, in the enclosed\r\nstatement, to set forth my recollection of the tragic events of\r\nNovember 22, 1963. I am conscious of the limitations of my narrative.\r\nI had no opportunity, in the difficult and critical days following\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy, to record my impressions.\r\nRecollection at this late date is necessarily incomplete.\r\n\r\nHowever, I fully realize the great importance of your task, and I have\r\nendeavored, as best I can, to set forth the events and my impressions\r\nas they remain in my mind at this time. Although I fear that they will\r\nbe of little specific use to you, I hope that they may be of some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nI hope that you and the members of your Commission, as well as the\r\ndevoted members of the staff who have worked so long and diligently on\r\nthis undertaking, will accept my thanks and good wishes.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely,\r\n\r\n    LYNDON B. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Enclosure.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Statement of the President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, concerning the\r\nevents of November 22, 1963]\r\n\r\nFriday morning, November 22, began with a reception in the Longhorn\r\nRoom of the Hotel Texas, Fort Worth. President and Mrs. Kennedy and\r\nMrs. Johnson and I had spent the night in that hotel. Then, President\r\nKennedy and I went to a parking lot across from the hotel where a\r\nspeaker's stand had been set up and we addressed a crowd that was\r\ngathered there. We then returned to the hotel and had breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfter that, at about 10:30 a.m., we motored to the Fort Worth airfield.\r\nMrs. Johnson and I then went aboard _Air Force II_ for the trip to\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Love Field in Dallas, as I remember, just shortly after\r\n11:30 a.m.\r\n\r\nAgents Youngblood and Johns and two other agents were with us.\r\n\r\nWe disembarked from the plane promptly after it came to a stop at Love\r\nField. We were met by a committee of local officials and citizens.\r\nAfter greeting them, Mrs. Johnson and I, together with the special\r\nagents, walked over to the area where President and Mrs. Kennedy would\r\ndisembark. We were followed by the reception committee.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy's plane arrived about 5 or 10 minutes after _Air\r\nForce II_. The President and Mrs. Kennedy disembarked and they greeted\r\nus and the people in the reception committee.\r\n\r\nThen the President and Mrs. Kennedy walked along the fence, shaking\r\nhands with people in the crowd that had assembled. Mrs. Johnson and I\r\nfollowed along the fence, greeting people and shaking hands. This took\r\n5 or 10 minutes, as I recall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnson, Senator Ralph Yarborough, and I then entered the car\r\nwhich had been provided for us in the motorcade. It was a Lincoln\r\nContinental convertible. I think that our car was the fourth in the\r\nmotorcade. We were the second car behind the President's automobile.\r\n\r\nThe driver of the car in which Mrs. Johnson and I were riding was\r\nHurchel Jacks, who is a member of the Texas State Highway Patrol. Agent\r\nYoungblood was sitting next to him in the front seat.\r\n\r\nI was sitting behind Agent Youngblood; Mrs. Johnson was next to me;\r\nand Senator Yarborough was on the left of the rear seat--that is, just\r\nbehind the driver.\r\n\r\nAt first, as we left Love Field and proceeded through the\r\nless-populated areas, the crowds were thin. I recall, however, that\r\nMrs. Johnson and I and Senator Yarborough commented upon the good\r\nspirit and obvious good wishes of the crowd. As we drove closer to\r\ntown, the crowds became quite large.\r\n\r\nWe made several stops as a result of stops by the automobiles ahead of\r\nus. I did not get out of the car, but on occasion a few people broke\r\nfrom the crowd and ran over, and I shook hands with several people on\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nThe motorcade proceeded down Main Street and then turned right on\r\nHouston. It then turned into Elm, which is a block, I believe, beyond\r\nthe intersection of Main and Houston. The crowd on Elm Street was\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street to the point where the\r\nassassination occurred, it was traveling at a speed which I should\r\nestimate at 12 or 15 miles and hour.\r\n\r\nAfter we had proceeded a short way down Elm Street, I heard a sharp\r\nreport. The crowd at this point had become somewhat spotty.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Presidential car was then about three car lengths behind\r\nPresident Kennedy's car, with the Presidential followup car intervening.\r\n\r\nI was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no time to\r\nspeculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood turned in a flash,\r\nimmediately after the first explosion, hitting me on the shoulder, and\r\nshouted to all of us in the back seat to get down. I was pushed down by\r\nAgent Youngblood. Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed\r\nme, he vaulted over the back seat and sat on me. I was bent over under\r\nthe weight of Agent Youngblood's body, toward Mrs. Johnson and Senator\r\nYarborough.\r\n\r\nI remember attempting to turn my head to make sure that Mrs. Johnson\r\nhad bent down. Both she and Senator Yarborough had crouched down at\r\nAgent Youngblood's command.\r\n\r\nAt some time in this sequence of events, I heard other explosions. It\r\nwas impossible for me to tell the direction from which the explosions\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nI felt the automobile sharply accelerate, and in a moment or so Agent\r\nYoungblood released me. I ascertained that Mrs. Johnson and Senator\r\nYarborough were all right. I heard Agent Youngblood speaking over his\r\nradio transmitter. I asked him what had happened. He said that he was\r\nnot sure but that he had learned that the motorcade was going to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nI did not see anything that was going on in and around the President's\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the hospital; Agent Youngblood told me to get out of\r\nthe car, go into the building, not to stop, and to stay close to him\r\nand the other agents. When the car came to a stop, a cordon of agents\r\nformed around me, and we walked rapidly into the hospital and then we\r\nwent into a room there.\r\n\r\nBecause of the method which Agent Youngblood directed for leaving the\r\ncar and entering the hospital, I did not see the Presidential car or\r\nany of the persons in it.\r\n\r\nIn the hospital room to which Mrs. Johnson and I were taken, the shades\r\nwere drawn--I think by Agent Youngblood. In addition to him, two or\r\nthree other agents were there.\r\n\r\nAs I remember, we got our first specific report from Emory Roberts, one\r\nof the agents from the White House detail. He told us that President\r\nKennedy had been very badly injured and that his condition was quite\r\npoor. He said that he thought we should make plans to get back to\r\nWashington immediately.\r\n\r\nI asked about Governor Connally and was told that he, too, had been\r\nshot, but that his wound was not serious. I was told that Mrs. Kennedy\r\nand Mrs. Connally were uninjured and that no one else had been hurt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnson and I asked if we could see Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.\r\nConnally. Agent Youngblood told me that I could not leave the room, and\r\nI followed his direction.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnson was allowed to leave for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAt some time during these events, Kenneth O'Donnell, Congressman Jack\r\nBrooks, Congressman Homer Thornberry, and Cliff Carter came into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt was Ken O'Donnell who, at about 1:20 p.m., told us that the\r\nPresident had died. I think his precise words were, \"He's gone.\"\r\nO'Donnell said that we should return to Washington and that we should\r\ntake the President's plane for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI found it hard to believe that this had happened. The whole thing\r\nseemed unreal--unbelievable. A few hours earlier, I had breakfast with\r\nJohn Kennedy; he was alive, strong, vigorous. I could not believe now\r\nthat he was dead. I was shocked and sickened.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. O'Donnell told us to get on the plane and go back to\r\nWashington, I asked about Mrs. Kennedy. O'Donnell told me that Mrs.\r\nKennedy would not leave the hospital without the President's body, and\r\nurged again that we go ahead and and take _Air Force I_ and return to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nI did not want to go and leave Mrs. Kennedy in this situation. I said\r\nso, but I agreed that we would board the airplane and wait until Mrs.\r\nKennedy and the President's body were brought aboard the plane.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, difficult to convey an accurate impression of the\r\nperiod of time that we were in the hospital room. We were all stunned.\r\nI suppose we were in a state of shock and there was no time for the\r\nshock to wear off sufficiently so that the magnitude of our personal\r\nloss of this great man and good friend could express itself in words or\r\nin surface feelings.\r\n\r\nI suppose, actually, that the only outlet for the grief that shock had\r\nsubmerged was our sharp, painful, and bitter concern and solicitude for\r\nMrs. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDespite my awareness of the reasons for Mr. O'Donnell's insistence--in\r\nwhich I think he was joined by one or more of the Secret Service\r\nagents--that we board the airplane, leave Dallas, and go to Washington\r\nwithout delay, I was determined that we would not return until Mrs.\r\nKennedy was ready, and that we would carry the President's body back\r\nwith us if she wanted.\r\n\r\nWe left the room and were ushered by a cordon of agents to cars which\r\nwere awaiting us. At Agent Youngblood's insistence, I entered one car\r\nand Mrs. Johnson another. Agent Youngblood and I were sitting in the\r\nback seat and Congressman Thornberry was in the front seat.\r\n\r\nAs we started away from the hospital, Congressman Albert Thomas came up\r\nto the car. He saw Congressman Thornberry--I don't think he saw me--and\r\nhe asked the Congressman to wait for him. At my direction, the car\r\nstopped and picked him up and he sat in the front seat with Congressman\r\nThornberry. I am sure this didn't take as much as minute. Congressman\r\nThornberry then climbed over and got into the back seat with us.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the airport, we proceeded to drive to the ramp leading\r\ninto the plane, and we entered the plane.\r\n\r\nWe were ushered into the private quarters of the President's plane. It\r\ndidn't seem right for John Kennedy not to be there. I told someone that\r\nwe preferred for Mrs. Kennedy to use these quarters.\r\n\r\nShortly after we boarded the plane, I called Robert Kennedy, the\r\nPresident's brother and the Attorney General. I knew how grief-stricken\r\nhe was, and I wanted to say something that would comfort him. Despite\r\nhis shock, he discussed the practical problems at hand--problems of\r\nspecial urgency because we did not at that time have any information as\r\nto the motivation of the assassination or its possible implications.\r\nThe Attorney General said that he would like to look into the matter of\r\nwhether the oath of office as President should be administered to me\r\nimmediately or after we returned to Washington, and that he would call\r\nback.\r\n\r\nI thereafter talked with McGeorge Bundy and Walter Jenkins, both of\r\nwhom urged that the return to Washington should not be delayed. I told\r\nthem I was waiting for Mrs. Kennedy and for the President's body to be\r\nplaced on the plane, and would not return prior to that time.\r\n\r\nAs I remember, our conversation was interrupted to allow the Attorney\r\nGeneral to come back on the line. He said that the oath should be\r\nadministered to me immediately, before taking off for Washington,\r\nand that it should be administered by a judicial officer of the\r\nUnited States. Shortly thereafter, the Deputy Attorney General, Mr.\r\nKatzenbach, dictated the form of oath to one of the secretaries aboard\r\nthe plane.\r\n\r\nI thought of Sarah Hughes, an old friend who is judge of the U.S.\r\ndistrict court in Dallas. We telephoned Judge Hughes' office. She was\r\nnot there, but she returned the call in a few minutes and said she\r\nwould be at the airplane in 10 minutes. I asked that arrangements be\r\nmade to permit her to have access to the airplane.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Mrs. Kennedy and the President's coffin arrived.\r\nMrs. Johnson and I spoke to her. We tried to comfort her, but our words\r\nseemed inadequate. She went into the private quarters of the plane. I\r\nestimate that Mrs. Kennedy and the coffin arrived about a half hour\r\nafter we entered the plane--just after 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAbout a half hour later, I asked someone to find out if Mrs. Kennedy\r\nwould stand with us during the administration of the oath. Mrs. Johnson\r\nwent back to be with her. Mrs. Kennedy came and stood with us during\r\nthe moments that the oath was being administered.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget her bravery, nobility, and dignity.\r\n\r\nI'm told that the oath was administered at 2:40 p.m. Mrs. Johnson and\r\nMrs. Kennedy were at my side as Judge Hughes administered the oath of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe plane took off promptly after the swearing-in ceremonies. I\r\nthen called President Kennedy's mother, Mrs. Rose Kennedy. She had\r\npreviously been advised of the assassination. I told her of our grief\r\nand of our sorrow for her. I gave the telephone to Mrs. Johnson, who\r\nalso tried to bring a word of comfort to the President's mother. I\r\nthen called Nellie Connally, the Governor's wife, and told her of our\r\nconcern for her and John, and tried to give her some comfort.\r\n\r\nI then asked General Clifton, the military aide to the President, to\r\ncall McGeorge Bundy in Washington to instruct him to ask the Cabinet\r\nmembers who were on their way to Japan to return immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen we landed at the Andrews Air Force Base, I made a short statement\r\nfor the press, radio, and television. In my heart, I asked for God's\r\nhelp that I should not prove unworthy of the responsibility which fate\r\nhad thrust upon me.\r\n\r\n    LYNDON B. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF MRS. LYNDON B. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n    _Washington, July 16, 1964_.\r\n\r\n    The Honorable EARL WARREN,\r\n    _The Chief Justice of the United States,\r\n    Washington, D.C_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CHIEF JUSTICE: Mr. Lee Rankin, chief counsel to the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, has\r\nadvised me that the Commission would be interested to have a statement\r\nfrom me concerning my recollection of the events of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nBeginning on November 30, and as I found time on the following 2 days,\r\nI dictated my recollection of that fateful and dreadful day on a small\r\ntape recorder which I had at The Elms, where we were then living. I\r\ndid this primarily as a form of therapy--to help me over the shock and\r\nhorror of the experience of President Kennedy's assassination. I did\r\nnot intend that the tape should be used.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the tape recording is very poor, but upon considering\r\nyour Commission's request, I decided to ask that the tape relating to\r\nNovember 22 be transcribed. I am sending the transcription to you with\r\nonly a few, minor corrections. Perhaps it will serve your purposes. I\r\nhope so. In any event, it is a more faithful record of my recollection\r\nand impressions than I could produce at this late date.\r\n\r\nPlease accept, for yourself and the members of the Commission and its\r\nstaff, my thanks and best wishes for the important task which you\r\nhave undertaken and to which all of you have so generously dedicated\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely,\r\n        (S) Lady Bird Johnson,\r\n            Mrs. LYNDON B. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Enclosure.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Transcript from Mrs. Johnson's tapes relating to November 22, 1963]\r\n\r\nIt all began so beautifully. After a drizzle in the morning, the sun\r\ncame out bright and beautiful. We were going into Dallas. In the lead\r\ncar, President and Mrs. Kennedy, John and Nellie, and then a Secret\r\nService car full of men, and then our car--Lyndon and me and Senator\r\nYarborough. The streets were lined with people--lots and lots of\r\npeople--the children all smiling; placards, confetti; people waving\r\nfrom windows. One last happy moment I had was looking up and seeing\r\nMary Griffith leaning out of a window waving at me. Mary for many years\r\nhad been in charge of altering the clothes which I purchased at a\r\nDallas store.\r\n\r\nThen almost at the edge of town, on our way to the Trade Mart where we\r\nwere going to have the luncheon, we were rounding a curve, going down\r\na hill, and suddenly there was a sharp loud report--a shot. It seemed\r\nto me to come from the right, above my shoulder, from a building. Then\r\na moment and then two more shots in rapid succession. There had been\r\nsuch a gala air that I thought it must be firecrackers or some sort\r\nof celebration. Then, in the lead car, the Secret Service men were\r\nsuddenly down. I heard over the radio system, \"Let's get out of here,\"\r\nand our Secret Service man who was with us, Ruf Youngblood, I believe\r\nit was, vaulted over the front seat on top of Lyndon, threw him to the\r\nfloor, and said, \"Get down.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Yarborough and I ducked our heads. The car accelerated\r\nterrifically fast--faster and faster. Then suddenly they put on the\r\nbrakes so hard that I wondered if they were going to make it as we\r\nwheeled left and went around the corner. We pulled up to a building. I\r\nlooked up and saw it said \"Hospital.\" Only then did I believe that this\r\nmight be what it was. Yarborough kept on saying in an excited voice,\r\n\"Have they shot the President?\" I said something like, \"No; it can't\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nAs we ground to a halt--we were still the third car--Secret Service men\r\nbegan to pull, lead, guide, and hustle us out. I cast one last look\r\nover my shoulder and saw, in the President's car, a bundle of pink,\r\njust like a drift of blossoms, lying on the back seat. I think it was\r\nMrs. Kennedy lying over the President's body. They led us to the right,\r\nthe left, and onward into a quiet room in the hospital--a very small\r\nroom. It was lined with white sheets, I believe.\r\n\r\nPeople came and went--Kenny O'Donnell, Congressman Thornberry,\r\nCongressman Jack Brooks. Always there was Ruf right there, Emory\r\nRoberts, Jerry Kivett, Lem Johns, and Woody Taylor. There was talk\r\nabout where we would go--back to Washington, to the plane, to our\r\nhouse. People spoke of how widespread this may be. Through it all,\r\nLyndon was remarkably calm and quiet. Every face that came in, you\r\nsearched for the answers you must know. I think the face I kept seeing\r\nit on was the face of Kenny O'Donnell, who loved him so much.\r\n\r\nIt was Lyndon as usual who thought of it first, although I wasn't going\r\nto leave without doing it. He said, \"You had better try to see if you\r\ncan see Jackie and Nellie.\" We didn't know what had happened to John.\r\nI asked the Secret Service men if I could be taken to them. They began\r\nto lead me up one corridor, back stairs, and down another. Suddenly I\r\nfound myself face to face with Jackie in a small hall. I think it was\r\nright outside the operating room. You always think of her--or someone\r\nlike her--as being insulated, protected; she was quite alone. I don't\r\nthink I ever saw anyone so much alone in my life. I went up to her,\r\nput my arms around her, and said something to her. I'm sure it was\r\nsomething like, \"God, help us all,\" because my feelings for her were\r\ntoo tumultuous to put into words.\r\n\r\nAnd then I went in to see Nellie. There it was different because Nellie\r\nand I have gone through so many things together since 1938. I hugged\r\nher tight and we both cried and I said, \"Nellie, it's going to be all\r\nright.\" And Nellie said, \"Yes; John's going to be all right.\" Among her\r\nmany other fine qualities, she is also tough.\r\n\r\nThen I turned and went back to the small white room where Lyndon was.\r\nMr. Kilduff and Kenny O'Donnell were coming and going. I think it was\r\nfrom Kenny's face and Kenny's voice that I first heard the words,\r\n\"The President is dead.\" Mr. Kilduff entered and said to Lyndon, \"Mr.\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided that we would go immediately to the airport. Quick plans\r\nwere made about how to get to the car, who to ride in what. It was\r\nLyndon who said we should go to the plane in unmarked cars. Getting out\r\nof the hospital into the cars was one of the swiftest walks I have ever\r\nmade. We got in. Lyndon said to stop the sirens. We drove along as fast\r\nas we could. I looked up at a building and there already was a flag at\r\nhalf-mast. I think that is when the enormity of what had happened first\r\nstruck me.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the airplane, we entered airplane No. 1 for the first\r\ntime. There was a TV set on, and the commentator was saying, \"Lyndon\r\nB. Johnson, now President of the United States.\" They were saying they\r\nhad a suspect. They were not sure he was the assassin. The President\r\nhad been shot with a 30-30 rifle. On the plane, all the shades were\r\nlowered. Lyndon said that we were going to wait for Mrs. Kennedy and\r\nthe coffin. There was discussion about when Lyndon should be sworn in\r\nas President. There was a telephone call to Washington--I believe to\r\nthe Attorney General. It was decided that he should be sworn in in\r\nDallas as quickly as possible because of international implications,\r\nand because we did not know how widespread this incident was as to\r\nintended victims. Judge Sarah Hughes, a Federal judge in Dallas--and I\r\nam glad it was she--was called to come in a hurry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kennedy had arrived by this time and the coffin, and there--in the\r\nvery narrow confines of the plane with Jackie on his left with her hair\r\nfalling in her face, but very composed, and then Lyndon, and I was on\r\nhis right, Judge Hughes with the Bible in front of her and a cluster\r\nof Secret Service people and Congressmen we had known for a long\r\ntime--Lyndon took the oath of office.\r\n\r\nIt's odd at a time like that the little things that come to your mind\r\nand a moment of deep compassion you have for people who are really not\r\nat the center of the tragedy. I heard a Secret Service man say in the\r\nmost desolate voice and I hurt for him, \"We never lost a President in\r\nthe Service,\" and then Police Chief Curry, of Dallas, came on the plane\r\nand said to Mrs. Kennedy, \"Mrs. Kennedy, believe me, we did everything\r\nwe possibly could.\"\r\n\r\nWe all sat around the plane. We had at first been ushered into the main\r\nprivate Presidential cabin on the plane--but Lyndon quickly said, \"No,\r\nno\" and immediately led us out of there; we felt that is where Mrs.\r\nKennedy should be. The casket was in the hall. I went in to see Mrs.\r\nKennedy and, though it was a very hard thing to do, she made it as easy\r\nas possible. She said things like, \"Oh, Lady Bird, it's good that we've\r\nalways liked you two so much.\" She said, \"Oh, what if I had not been\r\nthere? I'm so glad I was there.\" I looked at her. Mrs. Kennedy's dress\r\nwas stained with blood. Her right glove was caked--that immaculate\r\nwoman--it was caked with blood, her husband's blood. She always wore\r\ngloves like she was used to them. I never could. Somehow that was one\r\nof the most poignant sights--exquisitely dressed and caked in blood.\r\nI asked her if I couldn't get someone in to help her change, and she\r\nsaid, \"Oh, no. Perhaps later I'll ask Mary Gallagher, but not right\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nShe said a lot of other things, like, \"What if I had not been there?\r\nOh, I'm so glad I was there,\" and a lot of other things that made it\r\nso much easier for us. \"Oh, Lady Bird, we've always liked you both\r\nso much.\" I tried to express something of how we felt. I said, \"Oh,\r\nMrs. Kennedy, you know we never even wanted to be Vice President and\r\nnow, dear God, it's come to this.\" I would have done anything to help\r\nher, but there was nothing I could do to help her, so rather quickly I\r\nleft and went back to the main part of the airplane where everyone was\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nThe ride to Washington was silent, strained--each with his own\r\nthoughts. One of mine was something I had said about Lyndon a long time\r\nago--that he's a good man in a tight spot. I even remember one little\r\nthing he said in that hospital room, \"Tell the children to get a Secret\r\nService man with them.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, we got to Washington, with a cluster of people watching. Many\r\nbright lights. The casket went off first; then Mrs. Kennedy. The family\r\nhad come to join them, and then we followed. Lyndon made a very simple,\r\nvery brief, and--I think--strong, talk to the folks there. Only about\r\nfour sentences, I think. We got in cars; we dropped him off at the\r\nWhite House, and I came home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, July 28, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF AMBASSADOR LLEWELLYN E. THOMPSON\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 3 p.m., on July 28, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Senator John Sherman Cooper (presiding), and Allen W.\r\nDulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; W. David Slawson,\r\nassistant counsel; and Richard A. Frank, attorney, Office of the Legal\r\nAdviser, Department of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthis Commission is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, could you please state for the record your\r\nfull name and address?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. My name is Llewellyn E. Thompson. I reside at 1913\r\n23d Street NW., Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. And could you state your present position with the U.S.\r\nGovernment and the positions you have held since late 1959?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. In 1959 I was Ambassador in Moscow, and then I was\r\ntransferred to the State Department as Ambassador at Large, and have\r\nbeen that since that time. In addition, I am now Acting Deputy Under\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nMr SLAWSON. Thank you. Ambassador Thompson has been asked to testify\r\ntoday on any contacts he may have had with Lee Harvey Oswald while the\r\nAmbassador was in his post with the American Embassy in Moscow and on\r\nany knowledge he may have on pertinent Soviet practices or American\r\npractices at that time which might relate to the treatment of Mr.\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nAmbassador Thompson, could you state all of the times and describe them\r\nwhen you heard about Lee Harvey Oswald's dealings with your Embassy at\r\nMoscow while he was in Russia, either in late 1959 or thereafter?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; the only recollection I have is that when I\r\nreturned from a trip to the United States in November 1959, or some\r\ntime after that, the consul informed me about the case, and said this\r\nman had asked to renounce his citizenship. I recall asking him----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that Consul Richard E. Snyder?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; I am almost certain of that. I recall asking\r\nhim why he didn't accept the renunciation, and he explained that\r\nin cases of this kind he normally waited to make sure the man was\r\nserious, and also in order to normally consult the State Department.\r\n\r\nI believe he told me at that time that the man had not come back again.\r\nAnd I believe that is the only recollection I have of the case at all\r\nat the time I was in Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. And that includes any other time thereafter, including\r\nthrough 1962?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; of course I read the press and was aware of\r\nthe case when it came up in the Department. There was some discussion\r\nof it. But no knowledge that I think would bear on the case.\r\n\r\nI recall, I think, being in Germany at the time I read in the press\r\nthat he was leaving the country--leaving Moscow, that is. But I don't\r\nrecall having been consulted about his application to leave.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Did you have any personal dealings or any knowledge of\r\nyour subordinates' dealings with Marina Oswald, Lee Oswald's wife, when\r\nshe applied to accompany him back to the United States in early 1961\r\nand frequently thereafter?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. None that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you could make any comments\r\nyou would like to make on the policy which Consul Snyder and others\r\ntestifying for the Department of State have described in their\r\ntreatment of Americans who sought to renounce their citizenship when\r\nthey came to Moscow, and how these Americans were handled?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Well, I am aware that we have had cases where\r\nsomeone would say they wanted to renounce their citizenship and then\r\nafter a few days in the Soviet Union change their minds. And while I\r\ndon't recall any specific cases, I do know we have had cases of that\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Was there any particular time in your career when this\r\nsort of thing was more frequent than other times--any groups of people\r\nwhere it might have occurred?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Well, I know that prior to my arrival in Moscow\r\nin 1941, when I was Secretary in the Embassy, that there had been a\r\ngreat influx from the United States, particularly of people of Finnish\r\norigin, who had returned to the Soviet Union. I think that some of\r\nthose people at least had not renounced their citizenship; they had\r\ncome over there under the impression that they would receive very good\r\ntreatment, and a great many of them applied subsequently to return to\r\nthe United States. But many of them were unable to get exit visas.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Were those that did not give up their American citizenship\r\nusually able to return to the United States if they changed their mind?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe so. I know of one case of a man of\r\nFinnish origin who worked for the Embassy, and he did return to the\r\nUnited States. It is the one case I know of personally. I am quite sure\r\nthere were some others who did get out.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Shifting now to the Soviet treatment of American\r\ndefectors, or would-be defectors, are there any cases in your\r\nexperience where you could comment on the Soviet treatment of such\r\npersons, how quickly the Russian Government made up its mind whether it\r\nwanted them for permanent residence in Russia and so on?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think that in recent times, at least, my\r\nimpression is that the Soviets, because of bad experience they have\r\nhad with some people who came there to reside, and renounced their\r\ncitizenship, have looked these people over and let them know that they\r\ncould not remain. I think there was a case since I left the Soviet\r\nUnion of that sort. I don't recall the exact particulars. But I do have\r\nthe impression that they now don't automatically accept people who\r\ncome and say they want to renounce their citizenship and would like to\r\nreside there.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Can you give the Commission any estimate on the time\r\nperiods that sometimes are involved in the Soviet authorities making up\r\ntheir mind?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think that there has been at least a case or two\r\nduring the time I was there where it was pretty obvious that the person\r\nconcerned was unstable and that the Soviets very quickly let the person\r\nknow that he could not reside. But since I did not handle these cases,\r\nI do not--I could not cite any specific cases.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, I have a name of an American citizen, Mr.\r\nWilliam Edgerton Morehouse, Jr., who, according to the records of the\r\nDepartment of State, was hospitalized in a hospital in Moscow in the\r\nfall of 1959.\r\n\r\nAccording to records furnished us by the Russian Government, and\r\naccording to the personal diary kept by Lee Harvey Oswald, he, too,\r\nwas hospitalized in the latter part of October, and commented--Oswald\r\ncommented in his diary--that in his ward with him was what he described\r\nas an elderly American. We are trying to locate that American. We think\r\nthat possibly this Mr. Morehouse was that person. I wonder if you had\r\never heard of Mr. Morehouse before, or know who he might be?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I have no recollection of having heard of this man\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Do you have any recollection of any other American that\r\nmight fit this description?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. No; I do recall that there have been American\r\ntourists who have been in the hospital in Moscow. But I don't recall at\r\nthat particular date whether there were any.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, can you comment on how Americans were\r\nordinarily given medical treatment in the Botkinskaya Hospital in\r\nMoscow, which was the hospital in which Oswald was treated, to the best\r\nof your knowledge?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. The Botkinskaya Hospital has a section which\r\nis reserved for the members of the diplomatic corps, and in case of\r\nprominent Americans, particularly if the illness were serious, they\r\nwere often treated there.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. You say the Americans normally were treated in a special\r\nward in that hospital, or a special section of it?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; it was a completely separate building, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Was this the invariable method of treatment, or would\r\nthere be a reasonable chance that an American might have gone into a\r\nnormal Soviet ward which would have treated his type of illness?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I would think that the ward which was reserved for\r\nthe diplomatic corps would probably only have been used for important\r\nvisitors, but it is quite a large hospital, with a large number of\r\nseparate buildings. It is quite possible for Americans to have been in\r\none or the other. And obviously, if there were an infectious disease,\r\nthey would be separated, and not in the regular section.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. If an ordinary American tourist or businessman in Moscow\r\nwere to receive an injury in, say, an automobile accident or some other\r\nnormal method, would he normally be put into the same ward as Embassy\r\npeople were placed, or would he receive treatment right along with\r\nnormal Soviet citizens?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think that there is an emergency hospital type\r\nwhere he probably would normally be taken, rather than Botkinskaya. I\r\ncannot be sure of this. But we had an American doctor in the Embassy\r\nwho would normally be called in on cases of this kind, and if he felt\r\nthe case required it he would probably apply to have him taken to\r\nBotkinskaya.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Do you recollect who this doctor was in the fall of 1959?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe at that time it was an Air Force\r\nofficer. It sometimes rotated among the services. But I am almost\r\ncertain it was an Air Force officer. I could get the name, but I don't\r\nrecall it at the moment. I just don't recall the name.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I suggest that the Secretary can supply the name for\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, do you think it would be usual of the\r\nSoviet Government to permit someone in Oswald's circumstances, that is\r\na would-be defector from his own government, to be treated in the same\r\nward as other Americans, or particularly as Americans who might come\r\nunder the category of this important person or Embassy official ward\r\nyou were speaking of?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I would think it is probably somewhat unusual.\r\nThis doctor could give you expert testimony on this, because he has\r\nbeen involved in almost all cases.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you happen to know whether that doctor is in the United\r\nStates at the present time?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. He was in Texas the last I heard. I draw a blank\r\non his name at the moment, although I know him quite well.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. I think with the lead you have given us, we shouldn't have\r\nany difficulty in finding his name. I have no other questions. Does\r\nanyone else present care to place a question?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. It appears from the testimony that we have heard that\r\nLee Oswald appeared at the Embassy on October 31, 1959, and stated he\r\nwished to renounce his American citizenship. As I understand, at that\r\ntime you were out of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was Edward L. Freers, Chargé d'Affaire?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was there a consulate in Moscow?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. There is a consular section of the Embassy, but\r\nnot a separate consulate.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who had charge of the consulate section of the Embassy?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. At that time I believe it was Mr. Richard Snyder.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And was he the one who advised you on your return to\r\nMoscow that Oswald had applied to the Embassy and stated that he wished\r\nto renounce his citizenship?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe that is correct. I think the counselor\r\nwas also present at the time. I think both of them informed me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. We have had in evidence dispatches from the Embassy\r\nat Moscow upon this question, and the matter was referred to the\r\nDepartment of State as to what steps should be taken towards his\r\nrenunciation. Was that the normal way of the Embassy handling such\r\napplications for renunciation of citizenship?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes, sir; I believe that would be done in every\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did the State Department have any policy, other\r\nthan reference to the State Department, as to the approval of such\r\napplications?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe our practice is that whenever we are\r\nconvinced that the man is serious, and knows what he is doing, that\r\nthis is allowed to take place--the renunciation is accepted.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is there a policy or practice of attempting to\r\ndetermine whether the person is serious, or whether the person might\r\nchange his or her mind after the original renunciation application?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; that is correct. Because, as I said earlier,\r\nthere have been cases where people have changed their minds in a very\r\nfew days. Also, there is always the possibility that someone might be\r\ntemporarily of unsound mind or some other reason, why it would need to\r\nbe ascertained that they were aware of what they were doing.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. There is also in evidence a letter, or a dispatch from\r\nthe Embassy to the Department of State, dated May 26, 1961, signed for\r\nthe Ambassador by Edward L. Freers, minister counselor. This dispatch\r\ndeals with the application of Oswald to secure a renewal of his\r\npassport. Were you out of Moscow at that time?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. What was the date, sir?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May 26, 1961.\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe I was in Moscow at that time. I took a\r\ntrip within the Soviet Union from May 10 to 14, 1961, but I believe I\r\nwas there on May 9.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Then these dispatches, they were sent in your name, or\r\nby someone for the Ambassador?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; but I don't recall having been shown them.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. For the record, Senator Cooper, could I state that the\r\ndispatch of May 26, 1961, you referred to is Commission Exhibit No.\r\n936, and the memorandum you are also reading from is Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 935.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How were those signed, Mr. Slawson?\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Commission Exhibit No. 935 is signed for the Ambassador\r\nby Boris H. Klosson, counselor for political affairs. And Commission\r\nExhibit No. 936 is signed for the Ambassador by Edward L. Freers,\r\nminister counselor.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I might also refer to the earlier dispatch November 2,\r\n1959, Commission Exhibit No. 908.\r\n\r\nNow, were the procedures followed with respect to his request for\r\nrenewal of his passport--that is in reference to the Department of\r\nState, for decision--was that the normal procedure followed when\r\npersons who had attempted to renounce or had renounced, claimed or\r\ndesired to secure renewal of their passport--to refer it to the\r\nDepartment of State?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes, sir; I think in every case that would be done.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, between the time of Oswald's entrance into the\r\nSoviet Union and his exit, did you ever see Oswald yourself?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. No, sir; I never saw him that I knew of.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you hear anything about him during his stay in the\r\nSoviet Union?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. My only recollection is of this first briefing. I\r\ndon't recall hearing anything else about him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In evidence it has appeared that not too long after he\r\ncame to Moscow, he went to Minsk and secured a job there.\r\n\r\nFrom your experience as Ambassador, our Ambassador in Russia, and also\r\nin other positions in the Embassy, would you consider that unusual,\r\nthat Oswald should be able to secure a job in a Russian factory while\r\nhe was there?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. No, sir; I think that once they had agreed to let\r\nhim stay in the Soviet Union, they would have assisted him in obtaining\r\nemployment, because they believe that everyone that is able to in the\r\ncountry should work, and since he was obviously not staying just as a\r\ntourist, I think they would normally have provided employment for him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Also in evidence it indicates he was provided by the\r\nSoviet officials with a passport or document which described him as a\r\nstateless person.\r\n\r\nFrom your experience would you be able to say whether or not that was a\r\nnormal procedure for the Soviets to follow with respect to an American\r\ntourist?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think that as long as they agreed to let him\r\nstay beyond the normal time of a tourist, that is a month or at the\r\nmost 2 months, that they would then provide him with documentation so\r\nhe could identify himself to the police. The police would not normally\r\nbe able to read an American passport. In the Soviet Union, if you\r\ntravel at all, you have to produce documentation--to stay in a hotel,\r\nvery often to obtain transportation. So I think it would be normal that\r\nthey would provide him with documentation.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would you say that in late 1959, or 1960 or 1961 that\r\nthe provision by the Soviet Union officials to a tourist of a document\r\nlike this, saying he is a stateless person, and allowing him to stay\r\nbeyond the usual time, for a tourist, was ordinary or usual? Would that\r\nindicate anything unusual to you, from your experience in the Embassy\r\nin Moscow?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. No; I think not. I think that in cases of this\r\nkind that this would be normal.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would it indicate in any way that they might be\r\nconsidering further his application to become a citizen of the Soviet\r\nUnion or, in another way, that they were considering whether or not he\r\nmight be used as an agent of the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Well, I think there have been a good many cases\r\nof people who have come to the Soviet Union from abroad, and I believe\r\nthat a number of them have not formally renounced citizenship. I recall\r\nthat in 1941, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, that there were a\r\nnumber of people who turned up that we had not known were in the Soviet\r\nUnion, had never been near the Embassy, and had never, as far as we\r\nknow renounced their citizenship. But they had been living there all\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You would not have any reason to think, then, that\r\nthese circumstances might indicate that the Soviets were--could\r\nconsider using him as an agent at some future time?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I would not have much on which to base a judgment\r\non that, other than that it seems to me, of course, possible, in this\r\nor any other case in which a foreigner has come in to reside. But as I\r\nsay there have been a great many cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, there are many people of Armenian origin who have returned\r\nto the Soviet Union and have been encouraged to do so by the Soviet\r\nGovernment. And in view of the very large numbers, I would think that\r\nthe intention to use any of them as an agent would be very rare.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can understand, they encouraged them to come back because\r\nthey wanted their skills available.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When he applied for a renewal of his passport, his\r\nwife, Marina, made application for a passport. And I believe it was\r\nsaid that that was a prerequisite to securing an exit visa from the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nFrom your experience as Ambassador and in other posts in the American\r\nEmbassy, do you consider the time in which she was able to secure an\r\nexit visa from Russia, within so short time, as unusual?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Well, if it was a short time--and I am not aware\r\nof the exact time, myself--but if it were a short time, I would say it\r\nis unusual, because we have had cases that drag out over years, and in\r\nmany cases, of course, they never get an exit visa.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Well, perhaps without reference to time, from your\r\nexperience, have you found that--do you know whether it was difficult\r\nfor a Soviet citizen, such as Marina Oswald, even though she might be\r\nmarried to an American--that it is difficult for them to secure an exit\r\nvisa from the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Yes; it is very difficult.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know the basis for that? Is it that they do not\r\nwant to permit the exit of any Soviet citizen?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think that except in the cases of rather elderly\r\npeople, they have not wanted any of their people to leave permanently.\r\nThey let them go on tourist trips abroad, but not for permanent\r\nresidence. As you possibly know, leaving the Soviet Union without\r\npermission is one of the most severely punished crimes you can commit\r\nin the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was that?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Leaving without permission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Would the fact that there was a child born to Lee\r\nOswald and Marina Oswald have altered this practice of the Soviet\r\nUnion, as far as any experience that you have had or any knowledge you\r\nhave had about such cases?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I think the existence of a child born in the\r\nSoviet Union would normally make it more difficult for a person to\r\nsecure an exit visa.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Mr. Ambassador, in the facts of the Oswald case they\r\napplied to leave the Soviet Union, of course, well before their first\r\nchild was born, and in fact probably received Soviet permission to\r\nleave in late December 1961, and the child, I believe, was born in\r\nFebruary 1962--although the Oswalds in fact did not leave until very\r\nearly June 1962.\r\n\r\nThey nevertheless had received Soviet permission to do so before the\r\nchild was born.\r\n\r\nIn light of that fact, could you comment further upon the perhaps\r\ngreater difficulty of leaving when you have a child?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Well, I think probably having once processed the\r\ncase and agreed to let the husband and wife leave, that they would have\r\nbeen more inclined then to let the child leave than if the case had\r\nbeen considered after the child was born.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I take it the policy of the United States would be\r\nthe reverse--that is, because Marina was the wife of Lee Oswald, and\r\nbecause the baby had been born, the practice of the United States would\r\nbe to grant a passport to Marina for the child.\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I believe that is right, on compassionate grounds.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Are you familiar with the testimony about a loan that\r\nwas made to the Oswalds in order to help them get back to the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I have read in the press that they had received\r\nthe normal loan.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you say anything about that as a practice of the\r\nAmerican Government?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I only know that in general where a citizen wishes\r\nto return to the United States and doesn't have the means to do so,\r\nthat we frequently do assist them. This goes back many years. But I\r\nhaven't been myself concerned in this for probably 25 years, or even\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But is it the practice that if a determination has been\r\nmade that the individual is an American citizen, therefore entitled to\r\nwhat protections are given to American citizens, if necessary, loans\r\nwill be made to assist them to return to the United States? Is that\r\nabout the basis of the policy?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. That is correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think that is all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you have any conversations at any time while you were\r\nAmbassador or after you returned to the United States with any Soviet\r\nofficial with regard to the Oswald case?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I discussed with the Soviet Ambassador the desire\r\nof the Commission to receive any documentation that they might have\r\navailable, but I did not in any way discuss the case itself, nor did\r\nthe Soviet official with whom I talked.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And do you know of any conversations of that nature that\r\nany other official of the Department had in connection with the Oswald\r\ncase?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. I do not myself know of any.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You probably would, would you not, if that had taken\r\nplace--of any importance?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Your testimony is you have no knowledge of any other\r\nconversations other than that of the Secretary of State, in connection\r\nwith communications to and from the Soviet Government on this case?\r\n\r\nAmbassador THOMPSON. That is correct. I know of no other cases where it\r\nwas discussed with Soviet officials.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAWSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 3:40 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, September 2, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF C. DOUGLAS DILLON\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 12:05 p. m., on September 2, 1964, at\r\n200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator Richard B.\r\nRussell, Senator John Sherman Cooper, Representative Gerald R. Ford,\r\nAllen W. Dulles, and John J. McCloy, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present was J. Lee Rankin, general counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, would you please rise and follow me.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rankin will conduct the examination, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, will you state your name and residence,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. C. Douglas Dillon of Far Hills, N.J., presently\r\nresiding in Washington, 2534 Belmont Road, NW.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have an official position with the Government?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes, I do. I am the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In that capacity do you have responsibility for the Secret\r\nService of the United States?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes, the Secret Service is part of the Treasury\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you had that position responsibility for some time?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Since January 21, 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us briefly the nature of your supervision of\r\nthe Secret Service, prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes. Prior to the assassination, when I first took\r\noffice as Secretary of the Treasury, I naturally tried to find out,\r\nin as much detail as seemed practical, how the various offices of\r\nthe Department functioned. One of the important ones was the Secret\r\nService. So I had a number of interviews with Chief Baughman who was\r\nthe Chief of the Secret Service at that time.\r\n\r\nI got the general description from him of how the Secret Service\r\noperated, what their responsibilities were, what their problems were.\r\nAfter he retired, which was early, after I had only been there for a\r\nfew months, I spoke with the President about this matter--President\r\nKennedy--and it was my responsibility to find a new Chief of the Secret\r\nService.\r\n\r\nHe had known James Rowley very well as head of the White House detail,\r\nand he felt that he would be an appropriate head of the Secret Service.\r\nI talked with Chief Baughman, and he thought there were two or three\r\nmen, of whom Rowley was one, qualified to be head of the Secret\r\nService; so I decided to appoint Rowley and thereafter talked with him\r\nconsiderably about the White House detail which he was more familiar\r\nwith than Chief Baughman.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did not in any sense conduct a day-to-day supervision, or\r\nclose following, of its day-to-day operations. The Secret Service had\r\nbeen functioning for many years and the presumption from its record\r\nwas that it had been functioning successfully. I think that the events\r\nthat have developed since November have very clearly shown that some\r\nof the procedures, many of them, need to be changed and improved. I\r\nthink this is probably largely due, to a considerable extent due, to a\r\nvery rapid change which probably took place without our fully realizing\r\nits importance in the last 3 years, and which greatly increased the\r\nresponsibility of the Secret Service. That is the greatly changed\r\nnature of Presidential travel.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you describe to us how that affects the problems of\r\nthe Secret Service?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes. In earlier times, the Presidents did not travel\r\nvery often. When he did travel, he generally traveled by train, which\r\nwas a protected train. Doing that, he could not cover very many parts\r\nof the country, and the Secret Service could move easily right along\r\nwith him on the train that he was on.\r\n\r\nWhat happened since has been, first, the advent of airplanes.\r\nPresidents beginning with President Eisenhower began to move more\r\nrapidly and were able to travel considerably more, and on very short\r\ntime differentials they could be in cities that were thousands of miles\r\napart.\r\n\r\nHowever, this only just began with President Eisenhower because, in\r\nthe first place, jets were not yet available, and in the second place,\r\nin the last 4 years of his term, he had to take greater care of his\r\nhealth, and he didn't travel around the country quite as much as his\r\nsuccessors have. So when President Kennedy came into office with the\r\navailability of, the relatively recent availability, of jets and his\r\ndesire to travel, this greatly increased the burden on the Secret\r\nService. Formerly when they had a trip, they used to send out an\r\nadvance agent to some big town. Now the trip would be a 3-day trip, and\r\nthere might be four towns, each one 1,000 miles apart, that would have\r\nto be covered thoroughly at the same time. I think that probably there\r\nwas not a full realization by anyone of this problem.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Secret Service came to me and said they needed more\r\npersonnel, and we tried to get them more personnel. Chief Rowley\r\ntestified, I thought quite convincingly, in 1962 before the various\r\nAppropriations Committees of the Congress and met with very little\r\nsuccess because I think that this was not fully understood by the\r\npublic. The Appropriations Committees were a reflection of public\r\nunderstanding, and probably it was not even fully understood within the\r\nSecret Service.\r\n\r\nI would like----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Has there been any increase, Mr. Secretary, in the\r\nnumber of agents assigned to guard the President. I thought there had\r\nbeen some increase in recent years?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. There has been some increase, and we have tried very\r\nhard to increase the Secret Service in the last 3 or 4 years. We have\r\nasked for more people every year, and while we never got the amount we\r\nasked for, we did get increases. I have the figures here. In 1961, the\r\nentire Secret Service amounted to 454 individuals, of whom 305 were\r\nclassified as agents. In 1964, that is the fiscal year just finished,\r\nthe figure was 571, of which 167 were clerks and 404 were agents. So we\r\nhad achieved an increase of about 100 agents, a little over a third.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That included both the counterfeiting responsibilities of\r\nthe Secret Service as well as the Presidential protection?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is right. And I think it is important to note\r\nthat the counterfeiting problem was also increasing in volume very\r\nrapidly and changing very rapidly at about the same time. Actually that\r\nmay have started a few years earlier because of the development of\r\nphotography, which enabled one to counterfeit by photography instead of\r\nhaving to do it by hand engraving.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Wasn't the specific request for an increase in the\r\nWhite House detail--I use this in a broad sense for both the President\r\nand Vice President--primarily aimed at the increase of personnel for\r\nthe Vice President?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That was in one year.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 1962?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I think that was in--I think that was in 1963. In\r\n1962 the law was passed, and we did have a deficiency appropriation\r\nwhich was given to us. The following year when we came up for our\r\nregular appropriation, we not only did not get the full amount that\r\nwe thought was necessary to cover the Vice President, but they cut\r\nthe protection we had been affording the Vice President in half, and\r\nwhereas there had been 20 persons assigned, they reduced it to 10.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there had been no reduction in the funds for\r\nthe protection of the President?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. For the White House detail; no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It was a reduction for the protection of the Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is correct. But the thing that I think we are\r\ncoming to is, it is perfectly obvious that we have to do a great deal\r\nmore in this advance work, field work, in interviewing people who are\r\ndangers to the President or could be classified as such. We need more\r\npeople in the field on account of this. That is what I say was not\r\nprobably fully realized, although Rowley specifically, when he first\r\nwent up in 1962 asking for an increase, pitched it on that basis, but\r\nhe did not have a very good reception from the Appropriations Committee\r\nat that time because they felt that the White House detail was the\r\nWhite House detail, right around the President. I don't think anyone\r\nfully understood the connection with people in the field. I am not sure\r\nthat Secret Service made as good a case as they should, to be really\r\nunderstood on this. It has become clear now.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Rowley in that presentation asked for\r\nadditional funds for and personnel for the Protective Research Service?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I don't think it was specifically for that. It was\r\nfor protection of the President, and he was the first person that made\r\nthis type of request. Baughman had always said that people in the field\r\nwere counterfeiting and just worked a little bit for the President, and\r\nRowley when he came in was the first one that made this claim that they\r\nwere needed to actually protect the President. He wanted more people in\r\nthe field to do these things, and that was the thing that did not go\r\nover right away. I think it would be interesting here. We have----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. May I interrupt a moment? We have a problem with some of\r\nthe members of the Commission that have to go to the Congress right\r\naway for the vote. They would like to question you if they may.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have a question which I think you can address\r\nyourself fully to later but considering these new factors which make\r\nthe protection of the President more difficult, I would like to ask if\r\nit is your judgment that the Secret Service, if it is provided adequate\r\npersonnel and if it is--if a broader criteria for the ascertainment of\r\nthe persons who might be dangerous to the President is adopted, if it\r\nis your judgment that the Secret Service could meet these new factors\r\nand provide an effective protection for the President, taking into\r\nconsideration the factors which you mentioned?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; I think they could. I think the answer\r\nis clearcut. I don't think that means that under every and all\r\ncircumstances you could be absolutely a thousand percent certain that\r\nnothing can happen. You never can be in a situation like this. But I\r\nthink they could be a great deal better, and you could feel everything\r\nhas been done. We have just completed--the thing I wanted to say--this\r\nstudy we have been working on many months as to what is needed to\r\nprovide this in the Secret Service. Chief Rowley was not able to give\r\nyou this when he was here before. I have given a copy of this to Mr.\r\nRankin. I think it ought to go into the record at this point.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, I will hand to you the document you just\r\nreferred to, called Planning Document, U.S. Secret Service, and ask if\r\nthat is the document that you were describing.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes. That is the document; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to ask leave at this time\r\nto mark this document our next exhibit number which I will furnish\r\nlater to the reporter, and offer it in evidence as part of this\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, that is not a security matter that\r\ncouldn't go into the record, is it?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No. I have one thing I would like to say about that,\r\nand I think it should go into the record. What this is is our report\r\nas to how many personnel are needed and what has to be done and what\r\nthey should do. We have transmitted that with a covering letter to\r\nthe Bureau of the Budget. The final decision on what will be done on\r\nmany of these things is taken in the light of recommendations of the\r\nBureau of the Budget to the President and what he finally decides for\r\nbudgetary reasons. So ordinarily budgetary matters are not published\r\nprior to the time the President has approved them. He hasn't approved\r\nthis. He hasn't seen it, but I think under the circumstances I see no\r\nreason under this special circumstance, why this report should not go\r\ninto the record, and I think it is perfectly all right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The report may be admitted and take the next number.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 1053-A was marked for identification and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This would be the recommendation of the Treasury\r\nDepartment to the Bureau of the Budget for the personnel and the funds\r\nfor the Secret Service in fiscal year 1966?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No. This is a recommendation to the Bureau of the\r\nBudget for the personnel and equipment that would be needed to put the\r\nSecret Service in what they consider adequate position to fully handle\r\nthis problem. They feel that it would take about 20 months to get all\r\nthe necessary people on board and trained. If this were started right\r\naway, as we think it could be if a reapportionment on a deficiency\r\nbasis were approved, this could start in fiscal year 1965 and depending\r\non whether such is approved, the fiscal year 1966 final recommendation\r\nwould be affected. But this is the total picture, and it is assuming\r\nour recommendation that they start in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, this is the plan that you would\r\nlike instituted immediately regardless of budget considerations.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mr. Secretary, there is nothing in this exhibit that in any\r\nway, according to your judgment, would compromise the protection of the\r\nsecurity of the President if it became----\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, no; and there is also with it--it is just a\r\ncovering letter but I think it is equally important--it is a letter\r\nwhich I wrote to the Director of the Budget on Monday when I forwarded\r\nthis plan to him, and I think that probably should also go in because\r\nit has a recommendation at the end covering the matter Mr. Ford raised.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, I will ask you if this document, dated\r\nAngust 31, 1964, is a copy of the letter that you have just referred to\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask that this letter, dated August 31,\r\n1964, directed \"Dear Kermit,\" from the Secretary, be marked the next\r\nnumber in order and offered in evidence as part of the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It will be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 1053-B was marked for identification and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. It is marked \"limited official use,\" and I think that\r\nshould be declassified for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, Mr. Secretary, will you very briefly describe the\r\ngeneral plan of your planning document. We have that so we can use it\r\nin considerable detail, but if you can just summarize briefly.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, in brief, this asks for a total of 205\r\nadditional agents, which is about--not quite but nearly--a 50 percent\r\nincrease from the 415 agents they now have. It asks also for 50 clerks\r\nto add to the 171 that are presently there. Those are stenographers,\r\ntypists and other clerical workers. And for five technicians. Of this\r\nthe idea is to put 17 agents and the 5 technicians in the PRS. Five\r\nwould be used to maintain 24-hour coverage in the PRS which is not\r\npresently in force because of lack of personnel. One would add to the\r\nResearch and Countermeasures Unit to fill out three full units that\r\ncould be operating all the time. Six of them would do advance work for\r\nPRS with local agencies and institutions. One of the new things we have\r\ninstituted is that each time they do an advance, someone from the PRS\r\ngoes out and works with the local law enforcement agencies. I think\r\nthat is obviously a very important thing. They need more people in view\r\nof the volume of traveling. Then they also need five more employees\r\nto expand our liaison with the other law enforcement and intelligence\r\nagencies. We now have one man assigned really full time to that. We\r\nfound even in the period that we have been doing this that while\r\nthat is a great help, much the best way would be to have individuals\r\nassigned to each agency that work full time with the agency, know the\r\npeople in the agency, and that is the only way we can be sure we have\r\nadequate liaison.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask, would that include the FBI?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the CIA and military intelligence services?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And the State Department possibly?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you specify those agencies. I was interested\r\nin what agencies you were referring to.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I would think certainly it would be the\r\nmilitary, the FBI, the security services of the State Department, and\r\nthe CIA.\r\n\r\nNow, there may be additional ones. There are additional ones within the\r\nTreasury Department. I think we probably have one, for instance, with\r\nthe intelligence section of the Internal Revenue Service, Alcohol and\r\nTobacco Tax Unit, and so forth, which a good deal can come out of.\r\n\r\nIn addition we recommend here five technical specialists, two of which\r\nwould be highly trained computer technicians, programers, and three\r\nless well trained to work with these others. The purpose of this is to\r\nautomate the whole PRS operation. We have been thinking of that for\r\nsome time. It was something that obviously needed to be done.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. Will you describe a little more\r\nwhat you mean by automate.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I mean using electronic processing, punchcard\r\nsystems, so that they would be able to pull out of their files for any\r\nlocality, various different types of people that might be a danger or\r\nmight have made threats to the President or to other high officials,\r\nso that they would be able to function rapidly and well in planning\r\nprotection as the President travels to these various cities.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Does that include computer systems?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes. And what I was going to say was about 2 or\r\n3 months before the events in Dallas, the Secret Service had asked\r\nthe IBM Co. to make a study of this problem for it. That study was\r\nnot completed until after the events in Dallas, and it did not prove\r\nsatisfactory because from our point of view it did not go into enough\r\ndetail in being able to handle criteria so you could tell when you\r\nretrieved a name from the file whether it was truly dangerous or not.\r\n\r\nWe needed a more complex system and after working with Rand Corp., the\r\nResearch Analysis Corp., and also talking with IBM, we all felt the\r\nbest way would be to hire some good programers, knowing our problems,\r\nand then work out a pilot program and get consultants in.\r\n\r\nOne of the things we recommend here is appropriation of $100,000 to get\r\nconsultants from IBM Co., Honeywell or other companies, and get pilot\r\nmachines to try to work out the details of this system.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. For the record, Mr. Secretary, you had no electronic system\r\nof this character operating before the assassination?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No. Now, the total of that is 17 agents and 5\r\nspecialists for the PRS.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for a long time, Mr. Rowley has believed that it would\r\nbe preferable to improve the capacity of the White House detail if we\r\ncould establish a headquarters pool of 18 men where new individuals\r\nwho are going into the White House detail would be fully trained\r\nfirst--before, they had to be trained sort of partially on the job--and\r\nalso through which you could rotate people from the field from time to\r\ntime, bringing them up to date on Presidential protection.\r\n\r\nSo we would ask for 18 people, 18 spaces for that.\r\n\r\nWe have asked for 25 spaces to provide adequate protection for the Vice\r\nPresident in addition to the 10 that are already on board.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, excuse me. I think spaces may not be clear\r\nto all our readers. Will you explain what that means?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Twenty-five job positions. I think the thing that is\r\nvery important here is to keep in mind that to keep one man on the job\r\naround the clock covering a post, which is the way the Secret Service\r\nworks--one man that would be always with the President or the Vice\r\nPresident, that would be always watching his house--to get one man\r\nrequires five job positions. In the first place, the coverage required\r\nis for 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there are holidays, there are weekends off. On\r\na full-time basis, the Secret Service works a 40-hour week, 5-day\r\nweek, as the rest of the Government does, and there are provisions for\r\nsickness and leave, and so forth. When the number of hours that a man\r\ncan work a year full time is figured out, it requires 5 men to fill one\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nSo that is one reason why these protective numbers may seem rather high\r\nto the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nWhen you are talking about the Vice President, and 10 people are\r\nrequired to produce two posts, coverage of two posts, it is obviously\r\nnot adequate because you have to cover his house, whether he is there\r\nor not, so that someone can't come in and put a destructive device in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis simply can't be done with the present numbers that are assigned.\r\n\r\nThen, going beyond this to complete this list, there is a request for\r\n145 agents in the field offices who would handle the substantially\r\nincreased volume of security investigations. We are now getting about\r\ntwice as many referrals already as we did before. Instead of something\r\nlike 25,000, we are up to something over 50,000, and they expect it\r\nwill go over 60,000 next year.\r\n\r\nTo really run these down out in the districts, they need, obviously,\r\nmore men than they have had.\r\n\r\nNow, one thing that they also need these fellows for, which I think is\r\nimportant, is keeping track of more dangerous individuals. They have\r\ntried to keep track of a few of them. But I think that probably a good\r\nmany more should be put on that list. It requires more people, so they\r\ncan periodically check up, and particularly before a visit, that all\r\nof these people are looked at to see where they are and what they have\r\nbeen doing recently before the President visits a particular place.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, while you are on that subject, could you\r\nexplain to the Commission how you make use of your agents in the White\r\nHouse duty and those in the field so they will understand that?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, yes; the White House detail is composed of\r\nabout 60 people now. About half of these are what you might call, more\r\nor less, permanent employees. They have been there for a long time, 10\r\nyears, 12 years, 15 years, on the White House detail.\r\n\r\nThe other half are shorter time employees who generally serve up to\r\n3 years on the White House detail and then either leave because they\r\nprefer other duty in the Secret Service or sometimes leave because the\r\nSecret Service feels they can do other duty better.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, for the protection of the President. Mr. Secretary, is\r\nthere any need to have the White House detail have any connection or\r\nreciprocal arrangement with those in the field?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I think it is a great help. Because of this\r\nturnover that I mentioned, very many of the agents in the field have\r\nhad service in the White House detail of up to 2 or 3 years. So they\r\nknow what the problems are and they are able to fit in very easily and\r\nvery readily and very quickly with the White House detail which is with\r\nthe President when he comes out on a trip.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. By fieldwork you mean attached to your field stations, of\r\nwhich I believe there are 65 in the United States?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; that is right. And if they had not had this\r\ntraining, obviously they would be enforcement officers and they could\r\nwork with White House detail when they come out, but they wouldn't be\r\nable to be as cognizant of its procedures, how the matter is handled,\r\nand they wouldn't be able to be fitted right into the routine as well\r\nas they can presently. I think it is highly valuable that we have this\r\npool of experienced people around the country and, of course, this is\r\nagain one reason that if we get a few more people out there, we will be\r\nable to do better.\r\n\r\nOne of the additional things that we are now undertaking, is, for\r\ninstance, these building surveys that are partially a result of a study\r\nby the Research Analysis Corp. This seems to be something that we can\r\nprobably do something about. We will probably use more people when the\r\nPresident travels through a city than we have in the past because you\r\ncan have some success in designating certain buildings as high risk or\r\nhigher risk than other buildings, and as I say, they are now trying\r\nto map the whole United States, at least the major cities where the\r\nPresident might travel, the routes he might follow, coming in from an\r\nairport, going to a major stadium or something like that so they will\r\nknow ahead of time what the danger spots are. And one of the obvious\r\nones which has come out is a warehouse where there are not so many\r\npeople in it and where someone could more likely be alone and therefore\r\nmore dangerous. A building that is full of people is not as dangerous\r\nbecause the other people would be watching. It is that sort of\r\ncriteria. The same thing about roof access. If there is easy access to\r\na roof and people are not usually on it, that would be more dangerous\r\nthan if there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, have you made quite a change in the Secret Service in\r\nregard to the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route since the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh yes. We have been doing this, and we have used\r\na great many more people as a result of this in our procedures, both\r\nlocal police officers and also our own people. The figures we have\r\nhere are interesting. They are in this report. From February 11--I\r\ndon't know why that was the beginning date for these figures--but from\r\nthere through June 30, we used 9,500 hours of work by other enforcement\r\nagencies. About 2,000 of that came from the Justice Department and the\r\nrest of it from other Treasury agencies, the biggest one being the\r\nIntelligence Section of the Internal Revenue, but also the Bureau of\r\nNarcotics, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit and so on.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that is in connection with this motorcade route?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is largely in connection with that, both\r\nplanning it out ahead and also stationing them in buildings that they\r\nthought might be difficult.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, Mr. Secretary, returning to your Planning document, is\r\nthere anything else that you have not covered in that?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, this is just the number of people. It does\r\nnot include in this figure any purchases of automatic data processing\r\nequipment. It just includes the study I mentioned. There are funds for\r\na new armored car, various funds for improving the intrusion detection\r\nat the White House, and lighting at the White House. There is no\r\nautomatic system now. If anyone breaks through the fence at night,\r\nnobody knows it unless someone should see them. They have developed\r\nsuch systems and the Secret Service would like to get one installed,\r\nso if anyone broke through, a bell rings automatically, and they know\r\nsomeone is on the grounds, and they can take action accordingly. Also,\r\nthey would like emergency lighting that would be hidden behind various\r\ntrees or behind the wall so that if someone broke through at a place,\r\nthe lights would go on automatically and the person would be seen. Then\r\nthere is just miscellaneous equipment that goes with increased staff,\r\nsuch as automobiles, radios, travel and transportation that goes with\r\nmore staff, and so forth.\r\n\r\nI mentioned some of the things briefly that they intend to do. I\r\nmentioned the PRS program, and ADP study. These special agents in the\r\nfield I think we have covered pretty well. They have clearly in here a\r\nnumber of things they have to do, which there certainly is plenty of.\r\nIn addition to that--I mentioned the pool. In addition to that we have\r\nmade arrangements with the Department of Agriculture and the General\r\nServices Administration has put the funds in their budget, to get a\r\nnew training facility. All we have now is a pistol range out at the\r\nArboretum, and this new one will have classrooms, pistol range, and a\r\nplace where they can practice automotive protection on a practice road.\r\nThis will be out at Beltsville at the Agricultural Station out there.\r\nIt is very useful. There are no funds for that in the plan.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I just ask you about the armored car, Mr. Secretary. Is\r\nthat to transport the President?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; that is right. A protected car, a second one.\r\nOne was fixed for the Government free by the Ford Motor Co., but our\r\nguess is that it cost the Ford Motor Co. somewhere between $175,000 and\r\n$200,000 to do this, and it didn't cost the Secret Service anything,\r\nalthough there was some research work done on the glass and armor by\r\nthe Defense Department. This was combined with research work they\r\nneeded for their own use, to develop protective glass and armor to use\r\nin helicopters in Vietnam. They split the cost. It cost about $30,000.\r\nSo I think they assigned $15,000 of it to this project. But it was paid\r\nby the Defense Department. That is the only cost on that one. But I\r\nthink the companies think that the Government should buy the new car.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We had some testimony here in connection with the\r\nassassination where it was developed that the access within the car to\r\nthe body of the President became very important. In the car in which\r\nthe President was assassinated there was a bar behind the front seat\r\nmaking it very difficult if not impossible for the Secret Service\r\nman who was operating from the front seat to get to the body of the\r\nPresident, and we were strongly of the view that cars that should be\r\nhereafter designed should have freedom of access. Either the man should\r\nbe in the jump seat or there should be means by which you could get,\r\nthe Secret Service man could get to the body of the President in case\r\nof a threat of an attack, and I think it is likely we will mention that\r\nin the report. But it seemed to me this is something to bear in mind in\r\nconnection with the design of a new armored car.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That would apply to an open car.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. It wouldn't apply I think to a fully----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Fully armored; no. That is right.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Closed car.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Usually on those motorcades you like to be seen.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you covered your planning document, then, Mr.\r\nSecretary?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I think that covers this.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask a question at this point? I have a date at the\r\nWhite House at 1 o'clock, not with the President, but with Mr. Bundy,\r\nwho wants to talk with me.\r\n\r\nHow long do you think we will be with the Secretary and will we resume\r\nafter lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I was hoping to get through. I presume he was hoping we\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I would like to if we could. I have to leave tomorrow\r\nto go to Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Well, would it interrupt you if I ask a few questions?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No; go ahead.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Ask what questions you want?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You testified, Mr. Secretary, you felt with these additions\r\nthat the Secret Service would be competent to cope with the added\r\nrequirements for the protection of the President which have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn testifying to that effect, do you include--you include the\r\ninvestigative services of your own which are quite apart, as I\r\nunderstand it, from the information that you may gather from other\r\nagencies?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is correct; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We have had the thought that perhaps the Protective\r\nResearch Section or Division of your organization wasn't as well\r\nequipped as it should have been nor as it might have been presumably\r\nfor the purely preventive investigative work.\r\n\r\nDo you feel that with this new plan of yours, that that would, be\r\nadequately taken care of?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; I do. It was not equipped, I think, adequately\r\nin two ways. First, it did not, as is clearly shown by the events in\r\nDallas, receive information on enough dangerous people. At least, they\r\ndidn't receive the information on Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nSo that what is required is the development of criteria, better\r\ncriteria, that can be circulated to law enforcement agencies generally,\r\nand which will insure that adequate information comes in. We are making\r\nprogress there.\r\n\r\nI think you have already seen a document with some criteria that were\r\ndeveloped, which has been circulated in Washington. A similar document\r\nhas now been circulated by the Secret Service Chief to all special\r\nagents asking them to write a briefer but somewhat similar letter to\r\nall chiefs of police, sheriffs, and State police in their localities\r\nwhich asks them to furnish any such information to the local Secret\r\nService agent. That is being disseminated now throughout the country.\r\nIt will be completed within the next 6 weeks or so.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have established an interagency committee which has as\r\none of its jobs the development of better criteria that will really\r\nresult in getting the kind of information we want without swamping\r\nus. If we are too broad in our criteria and we get a million names,\r\nobviously nothing can work.\r\n\r\nThis committee is holding its first formal meeting next week. It has\r\nrepresentatives of the President's Office of Science and Technology,\r\nof the Department of Defense, which is the Advanced Research Projects\r\noutfit, of the CIA, an individual who is highly competent in their\r\nfile section and who understands the setting up of complex files and\r\nretrieval, that sort of business, and four people from PRS, the PRS\r\nhead inspector, Mr. Thacker, the head of the research and development,\r\nMr. Bouck, the head of the files section, Mr. Young, and Mr. Stoner,\r\nwho is now handling the liaison job.\r\n\r\nThere will also be, although the individual has not yet been named,\r\na representative of the FBI, and with that I think that we will be\r\nable to develop criteria that will both be useful to us and be an\r\nimprovement on criteria that was so far developed with the help of\r\noutside consultants.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mr. Secretary, the impression has been gained, I think, by\r\nthe Commission that perhaps too great emphasis has been directed to\r\nthe mere investigation of the threat, of the particular individual,\r\nthe crank, or the fellow that sends the poison food or the threatening\r\nletter, and perhaps not enough in a broader scope, recognizing, of\r\ncourse, that you can't be too broad without defeating your own purpose,\r\nbut that there are perhaps groups or other areas of ferment that could\r\nprovoke an attack quite without the threat. Would you comment on that?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; one of the criteria that is presently out is\r\nmeant to cover individuals who have threatened bodily harm to any high\r\nGovernment official, with the idea that threat might be switched and\r\nvisited upon the President.\r\n\r\nThat would have worked in this particular case in Dallas if that had\r\nbeen a specific criterion on at that time, which it wasn't. We are just\r\ntalking about threats to the President. So I think that was one obvious\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this committee would be able to possibly come up with\r\nother groups that can be identified that would fit into this without\r\nbringing in too many names.\r\n\r\nThere is one that may or may not work out. I just cite this as an\r\nexample. People with bad conduct records in the Marine Corps for some\r\nreason have had a very bad record thereafter and there is quite a\r\nconnection of crime with that class of individual.\r\n\r\nIt may be that it would even be worthwhile, if it is not too large, to\r\ncover this. Why that is so, nobody has quite figured out. I think the\r\neye was focused on them because of this event in Dallas, but then it\r\nwas discovered that this group has been involved in an awful lot of\r\nother crimes of violence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As you read the Oswald life story, it looks as though he\r\nwas going into the Marines as a kind of escape.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. It could have been.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What you say is very interesting in that connection.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you excuse us just a moment until we see if we can\r\nfinish up.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I would think you might want to put into the record\r\nat this point a copy of the memorandum that I mentioned from Mr. Rowley\r\nto the special agents asking them to send letters to the local law\r\nenforcement institutions.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes. Mr. Secretary, I ask you to examine the memorandum\r\ndated August 26, from Chief Rowley and ask you if that, with the\r\nattachment, is the memorandum that you just described?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is. Fine. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask leave to give this document that\r\nthe Secretary has just referred to the next number in order and offer\r\nit in evidence as part of this examination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1053-C, for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. There is one other item--you asked whether there\r\nis anything else in general. We felt that the Secret Service did not\r\nhave adequate regularized scientific advice. They got some--they have\r\nbeen getting it over the years from time to time from the President's\r\noffice of Science and Technology, but we tried to regularize that.\r\nI have worked out an arrangement with Dr. Hornig and written him a\r\nletter which embodies that arrangement so that they would have their\r\nservices constantly available to the Secret Service and would give\r\ncertain specific advice; first, keeping the Secret Service informed of\r\nscientific developments of possible use in providing protection for the\r\nPresident, etc.; advising or arranging for scientific advice to the\r\nSecret Service in connection with specific problems of Presidential\r\nprotection as they may arise; and reviewing the technical aspects of\r\nthe protective operations of the Secret Service and its development\r\nprogram, and assisting it in establishing priorities and schedules for\r\nintroducing technical and scientific improvements. I have an answer\r\nfrom Dr. Hornig saying they would be glad to carry this out and saying\r\nthat he concurs in my judgment that the increasingly complex nature of\r\nPresidential protection requires that the Secret Service have access to\r\nthe best scientific advice and that they are glad to take on this job.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, I will ask you if the exchange of letters,\r\ndated August 31, between you and Mr. Hornig are the copies that I have\r\njust given you?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask leave----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just for the record, I wonder if he would identify Mr.\r\nHornig. I think we know, but possibly----\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, yes; Dr. Hornig is Special Assistant to the\r\nPresident for Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask leave to give this document\r\nthe next number in order and offer it in evidence as part of the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It might be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 1053-D for\r\nidentification, and was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, would you just briefly tell us without\r\ngetting into any classified matters or matters that are not properly to\r\nbe revealed because of the effects they might have on the protection of\r\nthe President, why the Secret Service would need a scientific adviser?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I think this is because they do a number of\r\nthings. First, they need it in the communications field. There are all\r\nsorts of advances there, and they have been assuring or working to\r\nassure the security of the communications of the President. In addition\r\nthere are all sorts of new developments in the form of protective\r\ndevices that are being developed all the time, better forms of\r\nbulletproof glass, better forms of protection of that kind, new types\r\nof protection against access. For instance, there is under development,\r\nI understand, a sort of a radar type of fence so that you can see if a\r\nperson comes through a certain area without there being any fence there.\r\n\r\nThey are developing, working on the development of other protection\r\ndevices. They have had very substantial progress recently, I\r\nunderstand, in the detection of weapons that someone might be carrying,\r\ndevices that are more effective. This is something people have tried\r\nto develop, I guess, for a long time. Apparently they are having some\r\nsuccess. It is that sort of thing that is very necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd then in addition this field of computer technology is highly\r\nscientific and complex, and I think that the scientific adviser is in\r\nan excellent position to be sure that the Secret Service has the very\r\nbest advice in trying to identify their needs and develop the machines\r\nfor those needs.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, it has been suggested to the Commission\r\nthat it might be of assistance to you and other Secretaries of the\r\nTreasury and the Secret Service to have someone acting as Special\r\nAssistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, having supervision, under\r\nyour direction, of the Secret Service in its various activities, both\r\nprotection of the President and otherwise. Do you think that that would\r\nbe of help or would it not?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I am not sure. You see, we have an Assistant\r\nSecretary, and I should think he probably would be able to do it as\r\nadequately as having another special assistant.\r\n\r\nWe also have a Special Assistant for Law Enforcement Coordination who\r\ncoordinates the general work of all our law enforcement agencies and\r\nworks with outside agencies on overall law enforcement problems.\r\n\r\nProbably of interest is that the Treasury Department, I think, has\r\nmore law enforcement officials working for it than any other agency of\r\nGovernment. It is a very large law enforcement organization, although\r\nthere are a number of separate organizations that work in different\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nSo we already have this. I think that it probably can be made tighter\r\nand should be made tighter.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of this matter, I think, is the advent of computers,\r\nof course, which is very recent and has changed what can be done\r\neffectively in this PRS. I think that should be done anyway. One\r\naspect of this matter that probably hasn't had as close and detailed\r\nsupervision as we may feel appropriate now is the White House detail.\r\nIt has always operated over the years in very close contact with\r\nthe President and has operated in a slightly different manner with\r\ndifferent Presidents, depending on their wishes.\r\n\r\nAnd it has been felt that as long as they were doing an adequate job,\r\nthat it was pretty hard to come in and tell them exactly what they\r\nshould do on a day-by-day basis because the President might not want\r\nthem to do that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIt is a very complex and personal assignment here that is a little\r\ndifferent than any other law enforcement agency, and I certainly think\r\nit should be followed more closely--gone into in more detail--from the\r\ntop level of the Treasury Department probably than it has, but even if\r\nit is, we are still going to have this problem that we won't be able\r\nto tell the President exactly what he should do in each case. So there\r\nnever will be that close sort of supervision of day-to-day operations\r\nof the White House detail--it wouldn't be effective anyway--that there\r\nwould be in another police operation.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. After the assassination, you did have Mr. Carswell take\r\nover certain work in this area, did you not?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; Mr. Carswell is my special assistant, in\r\nmy own office. He is a lawyer by profession and training. He has\r\nhad investigative experience, 3 years in Naval Intelligence on the\r\nactive side of it, and so he has some knowledge of this whole type of\r\noperation, and I felt in view of this investigation, in view of the\r\nwork that had been done, it was important to have someone with legal\r\nexperience that was close to me, that had immediate access any minute\r\nto me working on the matter. Then while this thing was running along,\r\nthey would get to me at any time, and I could ask questions, they would\r\nbring matters to me, we could handle this matter of being sure that a\r\nproper long-range plan was developed, and that the whole effort in the\r\nSecret Service was organized as well as possible. That is why I asked\r\nMr. Carswell, as part of his work for me, to undertake this special\r\nassignment, which he has done, and I think done very well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It has been suggested to the Commission that it might\r\nbe helpful if the National Security Council or some Cabinet level\r\ncommittee would help to supervise in this area of Presidential\r\nprotection. Do you have any comments you care to make?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; I think that would be helpful because in\r\nrelationship with the President, if there are questions of what is the\r\nproper protection, I think a group of the Cabinet would have a stronger\r\nvoice, and also having a group, the President would be more sure that\r\nthis was not just one man's ideas, that it would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure about the National Security Council as such because\r\nas I recall, the President himself is the Chairman of that, so he would\r\nbe advising himself, and I suppose this would be a group to advise the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We thought there might be certain advantages in that\r\nbecause if you prescribe things for the President to do, and he doesn't\r\nwant to do them, they don't get done in the field of protection.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is right. Then if you describe it in the meeting\r\nat which he was present, that might be well.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I suppose, Mr. Secretary, also if a committee of that\r\nkind was composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of\r\nDefense, Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, that you would\r\nhave on that committee the men who had all of the agencies that would\r\nof necessity have to be coordinated in order to bring all the work into\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes, and the Central Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. One thing about the National Security Council is that\r\nneither the Secretary of the Treasury nor the Attorney General are\r\nmembers of the National Security Council by law.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury has been asked by the Presidents to sit\r\nwith the National Security Council for some years, practically since\r\nits beginning.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General has sat with it during the last few years, but I\r\ndon't know whether that will or will not continue into the future. So\r\nthere is a certain problem there.\r\n\r\nIf this assignment is given by law to the National Security Council,\r\nand some other President comes along that doesn't ask the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury or the Attorney General to sit with it, the two people who\r\nare probably most concerned wouldn't have any part in this.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It would have to provide that in all matters relating to\r\nPresidential security, of course, they will be present. One way of\r\ndoing it, I would say.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; there should be some such provision; otherwise I\r\nsee some advantages as you say.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, are you familiar with the method of\r\nselection of the Secret Service personnel?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Only somewhat. They do get young men who meet their\r\nqualifications. They do hire them at GS-7 and they stay there for 1\r\nyear. If they have a year of satisfactory service, they are promoted\r\ntwo grades. Then if they have 2 more years of satisfactory service,\r\nthey are promoted another double jump to GS-11.\r\n\r\nThese individuals do not have the legal qualifications that some other\r\nlaw enforcement agencies such as the FBI require, where you have to be\r\na lawyer or an accountant, because they do other kinds of investigative\r\nwork and that wasn't thought to be necessary in the case of the Secret\r\nService.\r\n\r\nBut the Secret Service has felt, and I have inquired into this, that\r\nthey have no difficulty in getting young men of the highest type to\r\ncome and to take these jobs under the present setup.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have a printed or written list of the various\r\nqualifications that you seek in regard to the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I don't--I am not aware of that. There probably is\r\nsuch a list; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. If you have such a list will you please supply it to us?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; I will be glad to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to ask leave to give the\r\nnext number of exhibits to that document once supplied and make it part\r\nof the record.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1053-E for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Secretary, are you familiar in a general way with the\r\ninvestigation that the Commission has been making with regard to this\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; In a general way, I have followed it through\r\nMr. Carswell, who has followed it more closely, and through the Secret\r\nService, so I am generally aware of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And are you generally aware of the investigation in\r\nconnection with the assassination, the entire matter?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you made any inquiry in the Secret Service to\r\ndetermine whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was ever an agent of that\r\nService?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes. I heard rumors of this type of thing very early,\r\nand I asked the direct question of Chief Rowley and was informed that\r\nhe never had any connection with the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any evidence in regard to Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nbeing an agent of any part of the government?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I am not aware of any evidence myself in that way,\r\nbut I don't think I necessarily would be fully competent in that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But you have never heard of any such evidence?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. I have never heard it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any area of the investigation of the\r\nCommission that you would like to suggest that we do more than we have\r\ninsofar as you are familiar with it?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No. As far as I know, the investigation has been very\r\nthorough.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any credible evidence that would lead you\r\nor anyone to believe that there was a conspiracy, foreign or domestic,\r\ninvolved in the assassination of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No. From all the evidence I have seen, this was the\r\nwork of one deranged individual.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And who would that be?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any evidence in regard to any connection\r\nbetween Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No, no.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything that you would like to call to the\r\nattention of the Commission at this time that we should know or that we\r\nshould cover?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No; I think we have covered my area of competence\r\npretty thoroughly this morning. I can't think of anything else.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Doug, in the field that in the Commission here we have\r\ndescribed as the preventive intelligence field; that is, trying to\r\nidentify beforehand the individuals or the type of individuals who\r\nmight be a danger to the President, have you ever thought of any\r\npossible division of responsibility and of work between the Secret\r\nService and the FBI to define more clearly which each should do in that\r\nfield?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, my own feeling is that the agency that handles\r\nthe actual work of deciding who the individuals are that the Secret\r\nService should watch out for, which is the PRS, would function much\r\nbetter and would strengthen the Service if it works as it does now as\r\npart of the whole Secret Service operation, and working very closely\r\nwith the people who are on the White House detail and not having to be\r\ninvolved in a liaison operation somewhere else.\r\n\r\nSo I think our problem is to strengthen this PRS, and I think that this\r\nlong-range plan is a good beginning.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is necessarily an end because as soon as we develop\r\nthe automated machinery that we need, then we will know a little\r\nbetter, and we may need some people to make full use of that.\r\n\r\nBut this is enough to get it underway and all you can use, I think,\r\nwell, for that purpose at present.\r\n\r\nI would think that there is a liaison problem which exists whenever\r\nyou have liaison with anyone, whether it is within your department or\r\nwithout, as long as it is a separate organization. And I think there\r\nhas been clearly a problem of inadequate liaison with other Government\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nIt is much better now. We have already taken steps. And additional\r\nsteps of assigning specific liaison officers will help. But I think\r\nthis is something that has just got to be worked out continually at all\r\nlevels to make it work. So the problem is not unique to this situation;\r\nit affects all intergovernmental relations.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Today with the Communist Party and with rightist groups and\r\nwe have more and more groups--we have always had them, but we seem to\r\nhave more than others which might breed up elements of danger--is there\r\nany part of that you would like to turn over to anybody else or----\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I think the identification of groups that are\r\nlikely to be dangerous as groups would probably more likely fall on\r\nthe FBI because they study the background of these groups and they are\r\naware of them and try to penetrate them, and so forth.\r\n\r\nSo I think that from that point of view, they would certainly be\r\nthe purveyor, the first purveyor of the information that is needed\r\nand the ones who would have the responsibility of signaling to the\r\nSecret Service that this is a dangerous group and to the best of our\r\nknowledge these are its members. Some of the members would probably be\r\nsubterranean and might not be known. And it would be important that\r\nthey pass on that information on the individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service I think would be more concerned in dealing\r\nwith--trying to protect against the actual individuals.\r\n\r\nI think that probably on the basis of thinking of something that would\r\nbe sort of an international plot, Communist Party plot, or something\r\nlike that, I think you probably need all arms of the Government working\r\non that.\r\n\r\nWe can't say that Secret Service can do it alone. Central Intelligence\r\nAgency might get wind of it anywhere in the world or FBI would have to\r\nuse all its resources. Just to beat back something like that you would\r\nneed the combined resources of whatever you have got.\r\n\r\nI think there is sort of a greater thrust of continuing responsibility\r\nobviously on the FBI for following these groups, as you call them.\r\nFor following individuals which may come to their notice because they\r\nwere somewhat deranged or did something bad at one time, they would\r\nthen pass that on to the Secret Service, and with adequate manpower,\r\nI think that the Secret Service would have more or less the primary\r\nresponsibility of following those sort of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I suppose you wouldn't want to take away from the Secret\r\nService entirely the concern that it might have for groups?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. And the necessity of going into those groups to ascertain\r\nfurther whether they were a threat to the President?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; but I don't think it is their function to try,\r\nfor instance, to have undercover people to penetrate groups or do\r\nthings of that nature which the FBI generally does.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. And it is their job to do that. That would require,\r\nof course, a much larger organization, but I certainly think the\r\nService has to keep track of them, and they can't just say we have no\r\ninterest and everything must come from somewhere else. I don't mean\r\nthat at all. But that is not their primary responsibility. I thought\r\nthat is what Mr. Dulles' view of it was.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anything more?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Secretary, just one other question. It raises the\r\nquestion of the combination of the--in the Secret Service of the two\r\nfunctions of Presidential protection and of the counterfeiting and\r\nrelated investigatory duties in connection with counterfeiting. Have\r\nyou got any comments on that? Is that a logical or wise combination or\r\nwould you suggest any change there?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, these are two separate functions. I do think\r\nthat there is a certain advantage to it that has developed and\r\nwhich I think should be maintained. That comes from the fact that\r\ncounterfeiting is not an operation that is overly large; so it means\r\nthat people who are engaged in this can very well be trained. Many have\r\nhad tours such as earlier in the White House detail.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You transfer back and forth, do you, from these two\r\nfunctions?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Oh, yes; many of the people after a little service in\r\nthe White House detail find that life too strenuous, the hours bad, or\r\nprefer not to travel, and so forth, prefer the type of work that opens\r\nup in the counterfeiting section. Then they move out into one of the\r\nfield offices, and there are probably a few more possibilities as heads\r\nof these fields offices for higher level jobs than there would be in\r\nthe White House detail. So there is an interchange.\r\n\r\nNow, that interchange, I think, is useful because you do have these\r\nfield offices that you can then call upon to do protective work, and\r\nI think there can be much more of that because, as what I indicated\r\nearlier, with this development of more detailed criteria, the greater\r\nnumber of people coming in to check up on, there are going to be more\r\ninvestigations in the field that should be done by the Secret Service,\r\nand it can be done by these people who have had this training and\r\nwho know what to look for and who have worked on this same sort of\r\nassignment.\r\n\r\nThey also are readily available and fit right into the pattern of\r\nPresidential protection when the President goes to their area. So I\r\nthink that is another great advantage.\r\n\r\nSo therefore I think there is substantial advantage by having this\r\nadditional assignment which is in a different area, counterfeiting. I\r\nthink it is probable happenstance; it grew that way. It could have been\r\nin some other different area, but the size of it which is large enough\r\nbut not too large I think combines very well with the White House\r\ndetail to give us a possibility of making a very effective operation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do I correctly assume from what you have said that\r\ninitially your field offices were largely organized for the\r\ncounterfeiting side of the work but that is now changing, and more\r\nand more the work of the field office is coming into the Presidential\r\nprotection?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Well, I think certainly the amount that they will be\r\ndoing on Presidential protection has greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe counterfeiting hasn't decreased. That has increased also. But\r\nwhereas earlier I think they were only used in Presidential protection\r\nwhen they had to be, when they were pulled off their other jobs and\r\nbrought to Washington and sent to travel on a trip or something like\r\nthat, because extra people were needed, I think now if we get an\r\nadequate staff they will be doing more of this as a regular routine\r\npart of their job, investigating people in their areas as well as\r\ninvestigating counterfeit cases in their area.\r\n\r\nSo they will have more or less two permanent jobs to do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. While you may have had a decrease in counterfeiting, I\r\nsuppose you have had a great increase in forgeries, haven't you?\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Yes; we have had an increase I said in counterfeiting\r\nand also in forgeries.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Oh, in counterfeiting. I misunderstood you. I thought you\r\nsaid you had a decrease.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. No; a great increase in counterfeiting on account of\r\ndevelopment of these methods of photography.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; I recall now.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. That is similar to check forgery which is the same\r\nproblem on Government checks which has also increased.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\nBefore we adjourn, I would like to say to you, Mr. Secretary, that the\r\nSecret Service has been most cooperative ever since this Commission was\r\nformed. It has been very attentive to our every wish and has been very\r\nhelpful throughout. We appreciate it very much indeed.\r\n\r\nSecretary DILLON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Also, we appreciate the very fine work which the Internal\r\nRevenue agents did in making a study of reconstructing income of\r\npersons involved in the investigation and the other assistance that the\r\nagents gave in connection with our work.\r\n\r\n[In connection with the testimony of Secretary Dillon the Commission\r\nrequested and received additional information on Secret Service\r\nbudget requests for the fiscal years 1960 through 1965. The document\r\ncontaining the information was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 1053-F\r\nfor identification and received in evidence.]\r\n\r\nWe will adjourn now.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1:25 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, September 6, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 3:20 p.m., on September 6, 1964, at\r\nthe U.S. Naval Air Station, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nPresent were Senator Richard Russell, presiding; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, and Congressman Hale Boggs, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Dean R. G. Storey,\r\nspecial counsel to the attorney general of Texas; Leon I. Gopadze and\r\nPeter P. Gregory, interpreters; and John Joe Howlett, Secret Service\r\nagent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--The witness, Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald, having been previously\r\nsworn in these proceedings, testified through the interpreters as shown\r\nin this transcript as follows: *Translation is by Mr. Paul D. Gregory,\r\ninterpreter; **translation is by Mr. Leon I. Gopadze, interpreter.\r\nWhere the answer or a paragraph shown as part of an answer has no\r\nasterisk, the answer is by the witness herself without the use of the\r\ninterpreters.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Senator Russell, will you swear the witness?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Since she is already under oath in this hearing, I\r\nassume that oath will carry over?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. All right.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You understand that you have been sworn?*\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Gregory, have you been sworn in connection with these\r\nproceedings?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Will you do it, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you rise and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony that you are going to\r\ntranslate of Mrs. Oswald will be truly translated?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. To the best of my knowledge and ability, so help me God.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Gopadze, have you been sworn as a translator in these\r\nproceedings?\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you rise, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that your translation of anything of the\r\ntestimony of Mrs. Oswald will be true and correct, to the best of your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you. Mrs. Oswald, we're going to ask you rather\r\ninformally a number of questions about matters that have come up that\r\nwe would like to get your testimony about. Senator Russell will start,\r\nthen Senator Cooper will have some, and then I'll have a few I would\r\nlike to ask you about, and Representative Boggs will have some.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I suggest we designate Senator Russell as\r\nchairman of this meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you record Senator Russell, Miss Reporter, as the\r\nchairman of the meeting, please?\r\n\r\nThe REPORTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDean STOREY. This is Miss Oliver. She is the reporter to Judge Hughes,\r\na Federal judge here.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; we know her well by her reporting in other matters for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, there may be some repetition in what we\r\nsay, in the testimony that was taken in Washington, because, I among\r\nothers, could not attend that hearing, so you will understand if we ask\r\nquestions that are similar to those that were asked of you when you\r\nwere in Washington on other occasions.*\r\n\r\nWe will try to avoid any more of that than we can help.\r\n\r\nI have read all of your testimony. I don't mean that I recall all of\r\nit, but I read it, as well as your memoirs that were submitted to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nWhen you first met Lee Oswald, did he ever mention anything about\r\npolitics or his political philosophy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you ever ask him his reason for coming to Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Not the first evening when we got acquainted.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Prior to the time that you were married to him, did\r\nyou ask him his reasons for coming to Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Why did he say that he had come to Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me that the Soviet Union is the outstanding\r\nCommunist country and he wanted to see it with his own eyes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, I notice in your testimony that you said that\r\nhis memoirs insofar as he claimed that he wished to be a citizen of the\r\nSoviet Union were erroneous?*\r\n\r\nIn other words, I want to continue the statement so there won't be any\r\nconfusion--I'm not trying to trap her. But that he told you that he had\r\nbeen offered citizenship in the Soviet Union and had declined?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*Yes, that's what he said to me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he give any reasons why he declined citizenship in\r\nthe Soviet Union?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The reason he gave me for declining to become a Soviet\r\ncitizen was because he said that in case he did not like the way they\r\ndo things in the Soviet Union, it would be easier for him to leave the\r\ncountry than if he did become a citizen.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. After you were married to Lee, did he complain about\r\nthe way they did things in the Soviet Union?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. What?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Senator, excuse me, sir. I'm a little mixed up on your\r\nquestion. Would you mind to repeat that question, sir?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever, after their marriage, complain about\r\nconditions as he found them in the Soviet Union, or the way they did\r\nthings in the Soviet Union? I believe that was the word you said she\r\nused.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. What was the subject of his complaint?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not like his job. He did not like the wage scale\r\nthat they paid him, not only for him but for people that were engaged\r\nin the same line of work.\r\n\r\n*Then, he was unhappy about the restrictions that his movements were\r\nsubjected to, being a noncitizen of the Soviet Union. Every 3 months he\r\nwas obliged to report--every 3 months or every so often----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Periodically?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Periodically, he had to report to a certain government\r\ninstitution, where they would extend his permit of residence.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Were there any other restrictions on his movements?\r\nIf he had reported duly as he was required, could he have gone down to\r\nKharkov or any other place that he might have wished to go? * **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Of course, in addition to restrictions imposed on his\r\nmovements, there were other things that he was dissatisfied with in the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you care to give any of those?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was dissatisfied with high prices for everything that\r\nhe had to pay. He was dissatisfied with the quarters, living quarters\r\nthat he had.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you know whether or not he had any friends that he\r\nmade there in Minsk while he was living there?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did most of them work in the same plant where he did\r\nor did he make other friends out in the community?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He had many acquaintances that worked in the same place,\r\nbut he had no friends. He had two friends at work, in other words,\r\ncloser than acquaintances--friends--those that I know personally.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But none other than those that worked there in the\r\nsame plant?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. There was one young man who was a friend of his, which\r\ndid not work in the same plant, but was a student at the medical\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did Lee go to school while he was there in Minsk? Did\r\nhe do any studying in any of the institutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He did not.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Lee wanted to attend Patrice Lumumba Institute in Moscow\r\nbut his application was turned down. He was very much put out, because\r\nhe told me that one of the main reasons he came to the Soviet Union was\r\nto get education. He said that after his application was turned down.\r\nHe told that to me after his application was turned down.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Was that before or after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. After.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, in reading your testimony, Mrs. Oswald, I noticed\r\nthat you referred to a number of foreign students who attended the\r\ninstitutes in Minsk, including, I believe you said, a number of Cubans.\r\nDo you know whether or not Lee Oswald was acquainted with any of those\r\nCubans?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I have never met these Cuban friends of his, but I\r\ndo know that he and Erich; Erich is the medical student previously\r\nreferred to, they had Cuban friends. What they were talking about,\r\nI do not know. I have never met him. Lee was interested in Cuba and\r\nin Cuban affairs, but I don't know anything in detail, just through\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you know whether he had any Cuban friends here in\r\nTexas or in New Orleans after he came back from Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. [Nodding a negative response.]\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You don't know whether he did or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I don't think he had.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You don't think he did. Now, you referred to the fact\r\nin your testimony about his joining some gun club or rifle club in\r\nMinsk?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And he purchased, I believe, a rifle or he had a rifle?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. By the time we got married, he already owned a rifle and\r\nhe already was a member of a gun club in Minsk.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. From your testimony I gathered that he was not very\r\nactive in the gun club in carrying on with his rifle?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No. He never went hunting except once during all the time\r\nthat we lived in Minsk.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever discuss with you his desire to meet any\r\nhigh official with the Soviet Government?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He never did?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you know whether or not he carried on any\r\ncorrespondence?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Excuse me----\r\n\r\n*The only instance I recall--when we filed an application for our\r\nreturning to the United States, he visited some colonel, some Soviet\r\ncolonel, Aksenov [spelling] A-k-s-e-n-o-v, in order to expedite the\r\nexit visas for us. I also visited this Colonel Aksenov.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I'm sorry----\r\n\r\n*Correction. He never got to see Colonel Aksenov because when he went\r\nto discuss this question in the--whatever office that was--he talked to\r\nsome junior officer, and they would not let him have an audience with\r\nthe colonel.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you go to see the colonel likewise?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You were both there together?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. We never got to see him. I saw Colonel Aksenov later on.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Was he a colonel in the army or in the militia or in\r\nthe police or just what? Where did he get his rank?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was a colonel in the MVD, which is the Administer of\r\nInternal Affairs.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He had to do then with the passports. His\r\nrecommendation would have had to have been had with the passports?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I think so. I do not know definitely, but that meeting\r\nwas in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was not dressed in a\r\nmilitary uniform.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Had you known the colonel prior to that time?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he introduced himself as Colonel Aksenov.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. When?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When I talked to him concerning these documents for exit\r\nvisas. Even if he were in a uniform, I would not have known what the\r\ninsignia meant.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. If you didn't know him prior to that time, why is it\r\nyou got to see him and Lee could not visit him?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When Lee went to see Colonel Aksenov in regard to the\r\nexit visas and other documents, he could not see the colonel. Then, on\r\nanother later occasion, I went to see the colonel and they let me see\r\nhim, on a later occasion.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you don't know why?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD (no response).\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did any of your friends or relatives intercede with\r\nthe colonel in your behalf?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My uncle works in the MVD, but I'm sure that he did not\r\ndiscuss this matter of exit visas with Colonel Aksenov because I think\r\nhe would have been afraid to talk about it. When my uncle knew that\r\nLee and I were planning to go back to the United States, my uncle was\r\nafraid for his own job and for his own welfare.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I knew you testified before that he did not want you\r\nto come to the United States, that your uncle did not, but he was\r\nworking in the same line of work as this colonel was?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. In the same building, but not in the same department. I\r\nbelieve that Colonel Aksenov knew my uncle.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes; but you didn't testify before, I believe, that\r\nyour uncle would have been afraid to have helped you. You did testify\r\nthat he did not want you to leave Russia? That's the way I recall it. I\r\ncould be in error about that--do you know why he was afraid? Why should\r\nhe have been afraid for you to leave Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My uncle never told me personally that he was afraid that\r\nsomething might happen to him if I went to America, but his wife, my\r\naunt, confided in me that my uncle was afraid for his job and for his\r\nwell-being if I went to America.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. What rank did your uncle hold in the MVD? If this man\r\nwas a colonel, what was your uncle, was he a colonel or a major or\r\nwhat?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My uncle has a degree in forestry, but he is also a\r\ncolonel in MVD. Every employee has to be in the service, in the\r\nmilitary service. He has a degree in forestry, but he is also a colonel\r\nin MVD.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He also has the rank of a colonel in the MVD?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. He is the head of the forestry department in MVD. I\r\ndon't know what he is doing there.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you ever have any occasion or know any other\r\nRussian wife of a foreigner who tried to leave Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Mrs. Zeger. Mrs. Zeger and her husband lived in Argentina\r\nfor 25 years----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, you testified very fully about them. But I am\r\nasking now if you know of any Russian national or citizen who was\r\nmarried to a foreign national who ever was able to get a visa to leave\r\nfrom Russia?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I don't know--I don't know of anyone. I only heard\r\nin the American Embassy in Moscow, where I heard of a Russian woman\r\nmarried to an American, who had difficulty leaving the country.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, that's what I had in mind.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Therefore, to the very last moment we did not believe\r\nthat they would let us out of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did they examine you very much or ask you many\r\nquestions about why you wished to leave, other than the fact that your\r\nhusband decided to return to the United States?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\n*No. We only filled out a proper questionnaire containing a statement\r\nthat this will be a permanent residence in the United States, or\r\nleaving the Soviet Union for permanent residence in the United States.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And none of the officials or police examined you at\r\nall about your reason for wishing to leave?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It's very surprising, but nobody did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you know as to whether or not Lee corresponded with\r\nany of his friends in Russia after he came back to this country?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*He did.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. With Mr. and Mrs. Zeger.\r\n\r\n*With Mr. and Mrs. Zeger, and Erich; the medical student. I don't\r\nrecall the medical student, and Pavel Golovachev.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Paul--he was one of your old boy friends, wasn't he?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Paul?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I thought one of them was named Paul?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD (no response).\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he correspond very frequently?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Not often.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you write very often to your family and friends in\r\nRussia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I wrote several letters shortly after we came to America,\r\nbut I never received any answer. I also wrote to some of my colleagues\r\nwhere I worked.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. In Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. And shortly after that, my aunt wrote me. Then I\r\nunderstood that perhaps the letters I wrote my aunt never reached her.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. She did not refer to your letters when she wrote to\r\nyou?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; the only thing that she wrote, she was glad to\r\nget--that she learned my address.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did she say how she learned it? That was my next\r\nquestion?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The supervisory of a drugstore, an apothecary----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. An apothecary?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Or manager of a drugstore telephoned my aunt and told her\r\nshe received a letter from me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But she did not answer that letter, or if she did, you\r\ndidn't receive it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No--she answered this letter.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I understand, but the friend in the apothecary, did he\r\nanswer?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, in some of your testimony you referred to a time\r\nwhen you became somewhat piqued with Lee about something and wrote one\r\nof your old friends there and forgot to put the stamp or didn't know\r\nthat the stamps had been increased--you recall that testimony, do you\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you write to any of your other friends there and\r\nput the proper stamps on them?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; this was the only letter I wrote.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. The only one you wrote?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. This was the only letter I wrote after I found out the\r\nproper postage required for mailing letters. After that, my aunt never\r\nwrote me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Have you corresponded with your uncle or aunt at any\r\ntime since this great tragedy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And did you receive any reply?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Have you written them more than once since this great\r\ntragedy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I don't remember exactly whether I did or not.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you've written them at least once without\r\nreceiving a reply?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I remember well that I wrote at least once, maybe it was\r\ntwice or three times, but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Has any official of the Russian Government\r\ncommunicated with you since this great tragedy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; no one ever communicated with me from the Soviet\r\nEmbassy or any other representative of the Soviet Government, and I\r\nfelt rather bad about it, because there I was--all alone in a strange\r\ncountry and I did not receive any encouragement from anyone. They\r\ndidn't approach me even as a show of interest in my well-being.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You didn't even hear from them with reference to your\r\napplication for visas to return to Russia, although you had heard from\r\nthem prior to the time Lee was killed?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Not after Lee was killed.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, if I've understood it from reading your\r\ntestimony, Mrs. Oswald, Lee went to Mexico from New Orleans a day or\r\ntwo after Mrs. Paine brought you back to Texas, is that right?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know definitely, but I believe Mrs. Paine and I\r\nleft one day before he went to Mexico.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He had talked to you about going to Mexico, had he\r\nnot?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he had told me he was going to Mexico.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And he had told you that he intended to visit the\r\nRussian Embassy and the Cuban consulate while he was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And that was at a time when he was very anxious to get\r\nto Cuba, I believe?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When was it, Mrs. Oswald, that Lee told you he\r\nthought it was best for you to go back to Russia, as to time? I know\r\nyou testified he told you that, but was that after the Walker case or\r\nbefore the Walker case? *\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I believe it was before he made the attempt on General\r\nWalker's life. It may be that I stated it differently in my deposition,\r\nbut I believe it was before. Lee insisted on my returning to the Soviet\r\nUnion before the attempt on Walker's life.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I gather from your evidence, Mrs. Oswald, that Lee\r\nwas a very devoted husband, unusually so for an American husband, even\r\nthough you had little spats at times. Do you think that he advised\r\nyou that because he thought something was going to happen that would\r\ninvolve the family in difficulties?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You don't think so?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he was not a good husband. I may have said so in my\r\ndeposition, but if I did, it was when I was in a state of shock.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You not only said so in your deposition, Mrs. Oswald,\r\nbut you testified in your testimony before the Commission several times\r\nthat he was a very good husband and he was very devoted to you, and\r\nthat when he was at home and not employed that he did a great deal of\r\nthe housework and in looking after the children?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Well, I also testified to the fact that he beat me on\r\nmany occasions, so some of the statements I made regarding him were\r\ngood and some were bad.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. In other words, some of them were not true that you\r\nmade?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; everything was true.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Everything was true?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*I made statements in the record that he was good when he did housework\r\nand washed the floors and was good to the baby, and again, he was not\r\ngood when he beat me and was insolent.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he beat you on many occasions?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Rather--many.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, you only testified to one, did you not, before\r\nthe Commission?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I was rather embarrassed to discuss this before the\r\nCommission, but he beat me on more than on one occasion.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And you stated at that time that you bruise very\r\nreadily and that's the reason you had such a bad black eye? Did you not\r\ntestify to that?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Was that true or not true?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It is true--it is--whatever I said.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. It is true that you bruise easily, but that was just\r\none of many occasions he had beat you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. On one occasion; yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you didn't testify to the others, did you?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I think I testified only about one particular occasion\r\nthat I was asked about, whether he beat me or not, and I replied that\r\nhe did, but he beat me on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever fail to provide for you and the children?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No----\r\n\r\n*While he never earned too much, but when he had the job and earned,\r\nsay, around $200 a month, we never had any particular need of anything.\r\nHowever, Lee was so frugal, not only frugal, but he kept part of the\r\nmoney in his own possession all the time that was not available for the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You always had plenty to eat and the children had\r\nplenty to wear?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Not really.\r\n\r\nWe were never hungry, but we didn't have much. We were never too\r\nhungry, but we never had any plentitude. We never had too much, and I\r\nwanted--I always wanted this and that, but that was not available.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But he never made a great deal of money, did he?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I marvel now how we managed to live on what he earned at\r\nthat time in comparison with what I have now. We spent $12 or $15 a\r\nweek at that time.\r\n\r\nWe spent $12 or $15 a week at that time--you know, we can live--that\r\nwas for milk and so on.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He didn't spent any money on himself, did he, he\r\nwasn't extravagant in his own habits? He didn't spend his money on\r\nclothes or whisky or women or things of that kind, did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Oh, no. He told--somebody told about Jack Ruby--he went to\r\nhis nightclub, he never did go to nightclub.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, I mean just extravagance in his own habits--he\r\nwas frugal in his own eating habits, he didn't eat much when he was\r\naway from home, did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You knew where he kept his money in your home, did you\r\nnot?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He had a black wallet, but I never ventured into it.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he not tell you to take some of the money out\r\nof the wallet at one time and buy some clothes for the children and\r\nyourself?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Pardon--you don't understand the question?**\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he did. It was the morning before the tragedy.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Before the assassination of the President?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever talk to you about the result of his visit\r\nto Mexico?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he say his efforts were all a failure there, that\r\nhe got any assistance that he was seeking?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me that he visited the Cuban Embassy and the\r\nSoviet Embassy and that they have the same bureaucracy in the Cuban\r\nEmbassy that they have in the Soviet Embassy and that he obtained no\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you have less money in the United States than you\r\nhad in Russia when you were married over there?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. We had more money in the United States than we did in\r\nthe Soviet Union, but here we have to pay $65 a month rent from $200\r\nearned, and we didn't have to do that in the Soviet Union. Here the\r\nhouse rent amounted to 30 percent of total wages earned, while in the\r\nSoviet Union we paid 10 percent of the wages earned. Then, all the\r\nmedical expenses, medical assistance--expenses are paid there. However,\r\nLee didn't spend much money on medical expenses here because he found\r\nways to get the expenses free; the services free.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You have testified, I believe, that Lee didn't use his\r\nrifle much, the one he had in the Soviet Union. Did he ever discuss\r\nshooting anyone in the Soviet Union like he did in shooting Nixon and\r\nWalker here in this country?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; not in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You haven't then heard from anyone except one letter\r\nfrom your aunt, since you left Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I received letters from my girl friend.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Oh, how many letters from your girl friend?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Just from one--a Christmas card--I don't remember how\r\nmany, probably not more than four or five.\r\n\r\n*But only one letter from the aunt.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. We received letters from Lee's friends written to both of\r\nus--several letters.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Written to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Written to Lee and to me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I see, but it's strange about your family that you\r\ndidn't hear from them when you had written to them?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It is strange and it's hurtful.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, I believe you testified that Lee didn't\r\never discuss political matters with you very much? *\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He discussed politics with me very little.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And that when he was discussing political matters with\r\nMr. Paine and Mr. De Mohrenschildt and others, that you didn't pay\r\nany attention, that they didn't address any of it to you, that they\r\ndiscussed it between themselves?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I did not participate in those conversations.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And that he didn't discuss a great many things about\r\nhis work and things of that kind with you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The only time he discussed his work with me was when he\r\nworked for a printing company. He told me that he liked that job.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Why do you suppose he told you about the fact that he\r\nwas going to shoot Mr. Nixon and had shot at General Walker?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. As regards General Walker, he came home late. He left me\r\na note and so that is the reason why he discussed the Walker affair\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n*Now, in regard to Mr. Nixon, he got dressed up in his suit and he put\r\na gun in his belt.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You testified in his belt--I was going to ask about\r\nthat, because that was a very unusual place to carry a gun. Usually, he\r\nwould carry it in his coat. Did you ever see him have a gun in his belt\r\nbefore?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I would have noticed it if he did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You wouldn't have noticed it?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I would have noticed it if he did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I see--you would have noticed it.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. And so--I have never seen him before with the pistol.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He didn't state to you that he talked to any person in\r\nMexico other than at the Russian Embassy and the Cuban Embassy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No. The only persons he mentioned were the Cuban Embassy\r\nand the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, going back to your personal relations, Mrs.\r\nOswald, with Lee. Do you think he wanted to send you back to Russia\r\njust to get rid of you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. This is the question that I am puzzled about and I am\r\nwondering about it myself, whether he wanted to get rid of me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you think he was really devoted to the children or\r\nwas he just putting on a show about liking the children?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he loved the children.\r\n\r\n*I believe he loved the children, but at times--one side of his life\r\nwas such that I wondered whether he did or not. Some of the things that\r\nhe did certainly were not good for his children--some of the acts he\r\nwas engaged in.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He knew you would take the children back to Russia\r\nwith you, if you wanted, did he not?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Of course I would have taken the children with me to the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. It seems to me that I recall once or twice in this\r\ntestimony when you had had some little domestic trouble, as all married\r\ncouples have, that he had cried, which is most unusual for a man in\r\nthis country--men don't cry very often, and do you think that he cried\r\ndespite the fact that he wasn't very devoted to you and loved you a\r\ngreat deal?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The fact that he cried, and on one occasion he begged\r\nme to come back to him--he stood on his knees and begged me to come\r\nback to him--whether that meant that he loved me--perhaps he did. On\r\nthe other hand, the acts that he committed showed to me that he didn't\r\nparticularly care for me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You think then that his acts that he committed outside\r\nyour domestic life within the family, within the realm of the family,\r\nwas an indication that he did not love you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The fact that he made attempts on the lives of other\r\npeople showed to me that he did not treasure his family life and his\r\nchildren, also the fact that he beat me and wanted to send me to the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And you think that the fact that he promised you after\r\nthe Walker incident that he would never do anything like that again but\r\ndid, is an indication that he didn't love you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Logically--yes. That shows to me that he did not love\r\nme. At times he cried, and did all sorts of helpful things around the\r\nhouse. At other times he was mean. Frankly, I am lost as to what to\r\nthink about him.\r\n\r\nAnd I did not have any choice, because he was the only person that I\r\nknew and I could count on--the only person in the United States.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he beat you very often, Mrs. Oswald, strike you\r\nhard blows with his fists? Did he hit you with his fists?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When he beat me, sometimes he would beat me hard and\r\nsometimes not too hard. Sometimes he would leave a black eye and\r\nsometimes he wouldn't, depending on which part of me he would strike\r\nme. When we lived in New Orleans he never beat me up.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever beat you in Russia before you came to this\r\ncountry?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Had you ever heard of any husband striking his wife in\r\nRussia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It seems that beating of wives by the Russian husbands is\r\na rather common thing in the Soviet Union and that is why I was afraid\r\nto marry a Russian.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I see. Do they beat them with anything other than\r\ntheir hands?\r\n\r\nThere was a law in my State at one time that a man could whip his wife\r\nas long as he didn't use a switch that was larger than his thumb. That\r\nlaw has been repealed.\r\n\r\nBut, did they ever whip their wives with anything other than their\r\nhands in Russia?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know. I was not interested in what manner they\r\nbeat their wives.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That's difficult for me to believe--that a very\r\ncharming and attractive girl who was being courted by a number of men,\r\nI would have thought you would have been greatly interested in all the\r\naspects of matrimony?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. How would I know?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. How would you know it--well, by general conversation.\r\nDon't people talk about those things all over the world--in Russia and\r\neverywhere else?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That's different there.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. People are very much the same, aren't they, all over\r\nthe world? If a man in the neighborhood gets drunk and beats and abuses\r\nhis wife and children, isn't that discussed by all the people in the\r\nblock--in that area?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **Sometimes during a life of 20 years with a husband,\r\neverything will be all right, and then some occasion will arise or\r\nsomething will happen that the wife will learn about what kind of\r\nperson he is.\r\n\r\n*I know of one family in the Soviet Union in Minsk, where a husband was\r\nmarried to a woman 17 years, and he just went to another woman.\r\n\r\nFor 1 year.\r\n\r\n*For 1 year--then he came back to the first one full of shame and\r\nrepentance and he cried and she took him back in. He lived with her for\r\n3 days and then left her again. He was excluded from the party.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Excommunicated from the party?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **Expelled from the party.\r\n\r\n*But he took all the possessions of their common property when he left.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I'm taking too much time, and I will hurry along. Did\r\nhe ever beat you badly enough, Mrs. Oswald, for you to require the\r\nservices of a doctor, a physician?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever strike you during your pregnancy, when you\r\nwere pregnant?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. She said, \"I think.\" She said, \"I think.\"\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he did strike me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. What reason did he give for striking you, usually?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Well, the reasons were if--they were very petty--I can't\r\neven remember what the reasons were after this quarrel was over.\r\nSometimes he would tell me to shut up, and I don't take that from him.\r\n\r\n**I'm not a very quiet woman myself.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. \"I'm not--\" what?\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. I'm not a quiet woman myself and sometimes it gets on\r\nyour nerves and you'll just tell him he's an idiot and he will become\r\nmore angry with you.\r\n\r\n*Enraged. When I would call him an idiot, he would say, \"Well, I'll\r\nshow you what kind of an idiot I am,\" so he would beat me up.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you ever strike him?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I would give him some in return.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You would give him some in return.\r\n\r\nAs I recall your testimony, when he told you about the Nixon incident,\r\nyou testified that you held him in the bathroom by physical strength\r\nfor some 4 or 5 minutes, so you should have been able to hold your own\r\npretty well with him if you could do that?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Probably not 5 minutes, but a long time for him.\r\n\r\n*Sometimes one can gather all of his strength in a moment like that. I\r\nam not a strong person, but sometimes under stress and strain perhaps I\r\nam stronger than I ordinarily am.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you ever strike him with anything other than your\r\nhand?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Well, I think at one time I told him that if he would\r\nbeat me again, I will hurl a radio, a transistor radio, and when he did\r\nstrike me, I threw the radio at him.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You missed him?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No--it broke. I missed him.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes, she missed him.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I tried not to hit him.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, going back a moment or two to your uncle, whom\r\nyou lived with and to whom I understand you are quite devoted--did he\r\ntry to keep you from coming to the United States very vigorously?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My uncle was against my going to America, but he never\r\nimposed his will or his opinion on me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he or any other members of your family ever\r\ntell you why you had such little difficulty in getting your passport\r\napproved?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. During the pendency of receiving this exit visa, we never\r\ndiscussed the question, my uncle and my aunt, but when we received it,\r\nthe exit visa and it was granted to us so quickly, they were very much\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Now, Marina, I'm sorry. I would like to make a correction\r\nto that point.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. That during the time they were expecting a visa to\r\ndepart the Soviet Union, the relatives didn't express too much about\r\nit--because they didn't [think] they would depart, and when they did\r\nreceive it, they were very much surprised----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. With the expediency of the visa. Therefore, they didn't\r\nbother asking any questions or into their affairs concerning the\r\ndeparture. The last time they visited their aunt and uncle, they say,\r\n\"Oh, of all places, you're going to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Lee never did make much more than $225 a month, in\r\nthat area, did he, and he was unemployed almost as much as he was\r\nemployed?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. How did he manage to pay the State Department the\r\nmoney he had borrowed from them and to pay his brother Robert under\r\nthose circumstances?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. He paid those debts out of his earnings. The first few\r\nweeks when we came to the United States, we lived with his mother, and\r\nthat gave us the opportunity to pay the debts.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, you only lived with Mrs. Oswald a matter of 3 or\r\n4 weeks, didn't you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; but he was earning money during that time.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I understand, but he was not earning more than $200 a\r\nmonth, was he, and he paid four or five or six--what was it, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It was over $400.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Over $450 or more to the State Department and some\r\namount to his brother Robert.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Around $100.\r\n\r\n*It was $100.\r\n\r\nIt was probably $100.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That's $550, and a person that's earning $200 a month\r\npart of the time, and having to support a family, that's a rather\r\nremarkable feat, isn't it, of financing?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I think that at the time we were leaving Russia, some of\r\nthe rubles were exchanged for dollars, and maybe he kept part of that\r\nmoney, of which I have no knowledge, when we arrived in the United\r\nStates. The only thing I know is that we lived very, very economically\r\nand Lee was saying all the time that the debts have to be paid as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I was under the impression that there was a very\r\ndrastic limit on the number of rubles that could be exchanged, that it\r\nwas a hundred or 130 or something in that area?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. According to the law in the Soviet Union, they allow\r\nabout 90 rubles per person to be exchanged into foreign currency or\r\ndollars--$180 in our case because Lee was including the baby, and\r\nshe----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. For each of them--the exchange.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Not for Lee.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. No; he couldn't bring out any more than he took in\r\nwith him. Well, he wasn't a visitor, though--yes, he was a visitor\r\nthen. I know they checked my money when I went in there.**\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. I don't know the reason why they didn't allow Lee to\r\nexchange $90, but I believe that there is a Soviet law that for Soviet\r\ncitizens they allow $90 for each person. Excuse me.\r\n\r\n*I believe that a foreigner is also entitled to exchange rubles for\r\ndollars, but in a very limited amount.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, do you have any plans to return to the\r\nSoviet Union, or do you intend to live in this country?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Of course--to remain in the United States.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I have a few other questions, but I'm already taking\r\ntoo much time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I want to say something off the record.\r\n\r\n(Conference between Senator Cooper and Senator Russell off the record.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I have just one question.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All right.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mrs. Oswald, have you been taking English lessons?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you speak English now?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I can't call it speaking English.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. But you understand English, you replied to my\r\nquestion a moment ago?**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. But you have been speaking English, studying\r\nEnglish, and whom do you live with now?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. With myself and my kids, with my neighbors.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you read English?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. A little bit.\r\n\r\n*A little bit.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Naturally, she knows the English alphabet, but she doesn't\r\nread too much.\r\n\r\n**Sometimes I read on my own, but on the other hand, it might be\r\nentirely different for an American.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, I believe you can speak it pretty well, Mrs.\r\nOswald. You are a very intelligent person, and I've never seen a woman\r\nyet that didn't learn a foreign language three times as fast as a man.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. They all do, and in some places in Russia you run into\r\nwomen that speak three or four languages very fluently, including in\r\nthe high schools, where they have 10 or 12 years of English, starting\r\nin the first grade with it?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That's the way they try--to learn it in school.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Is that your foreign language? I understand in Russia\r\neach student has to study some one foreign language all the way--or at\r\nleast for 5 or 6 years?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; but I don't like this system of education in Russia\r\nto study some languages--well, he can speak, you know.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, your attorney--your then attorney,\r\naccording to the record, asked the Commission some questions\r\nabout your memoirs, your diary or whatever it was that you have\r\nwritten--your reminiscences, and that they not be released. Have you\r\never made arrangements yet to sell them? Have you gotten rid of them?\r\nBecause--the record of the Commission will be printed at a rather early\r\ndate?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not want these memoirs to be published by Warren\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes; I understand that.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I am now working on a book and I may wish to include\r\nthese memoirs in that book. I have no objection to the publication\r\nof the material in those memoirs that have any relation to the\r\nassassination of the President, or anything that is pertinent to this\r\nparticular inquiry.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Of course, a great deal of it is very personal. It's\r\nabout your social relations when you were a young woman. Of course,\r\nyou are a young woman now, but when you were even younger than you\r\nare now, and the friends that you had, and things of that nature, and\r\nthis report is going to be published before too long. And that's among\r\nthe evidence there, and I was trying to get some timing on your book\r\nor whatever it is you are going to publish that would utilize this\r\nmaterial, in an effort to help you--that is the only purpose I had, to\r\ntry to see that you don't lose the publicity value of the memoirs.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I understand that and I'm certainly grateful to you for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n**Would it be possible to publish in the report only parts of my life,\r\nthat pertaining to the assassination, instead of my private life?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I cannot answer that, and only the entire Commission\r\ncould answer that, but when I read that in the testimony, I was hoping\r\nthat you had found some means of commercializing on it either to the\r\nmoving picture people or to the publishing world.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. As yet, I have not availed myself of that opportunity, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When do you think you will publish this book?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The publisher will possibly publish the book toward the\r\nend of December, maybe in January and even perhaps----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Not the publisher. The person who writes the story is\r\nhoping to be able to finish it in the latter part of December.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Of course, it goes into much more detail, I'm sure,\r\nthan this sketch we have, because this wouldn't be anything like a\r\nbook. It would be more of a magazine article.\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Would it be possible to delete it from the Commission's\r\nreport?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I can't answer that because I'm not the whole\r\nCommission.**\r\n\r\nVery frankly, I think the Commission would be disposed to publish all\r\nthe material that they have, is my own honest view about it. The reason\r\nI am discussing it with you is to find out if you have done anything\r\nabout it. Of course, if you are writing a whole book, it won't be so\r\nimportant, just this one phase of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD, during the course of your testimony, you testified that\r\nLee often called you twice a day while he was working away from home.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think he called you if he was not in love with you?***\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When he was away from me, he told me that he missed me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You don't think that's an indication that he loved\r\nyou?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. This shows--this would show that he loved me. He was a\r\ndual personality.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Split personality.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Split personality--that's it.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, I noticed that one of the witnesses,\r\nI've forgotten which one it was, that ran the boarding house where Lee\r\nlived, testified that he called someone every night and talked to them\r\nat some length in a foreign language. That couldn't have been anyone\r\nexcept you, could it, that he was calling?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I believe that I was the person he talked to.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He did call you quite frequently, did he not when you\r\nwere in Irving and he was in Dallas, for example?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Every day.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But he didn't call you to abuse you over the phone,\r\ndid he?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Of course not.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. It was the ordinary small talk you would have between\r\na man and his wife--he would ask you about how the children were--one\r\nof them--was?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He always talked about our daughter June.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he ever say anything about, \"I love you\" or\r\nanything like that over the phone?**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. (no response).\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Did he?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He did?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, you've testified before, and I'm just going on\r\nrecollection, but I'm sure I'm right about this, that he told you in\r\nNew Orleans that he was going to Mexico City and that he was going by\r\nbus and that a round trip would be much cheaper than a one-way fare.\r\nI noticed something in the paper the other day where you had found a\r\none-way ticket or stub on the bus from Mexico City to Dallas, I believe\r\nit was. How did you happen to come into possession of that stub?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. You say round trip was cheaper than one-way?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes; that's what you testified he told you in New\r\nOrleans when he said he was going. But here, according to the press--I\r\ndon't know--a one-way stub turns up where he came back here to Dallas.\r\nWhere did you get that stub?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My statement apparently was misinterpreted in the record,\r\nbecause Lee stated that the cost of the ticket, say, from Dallas to\r\nMexico is cheaper than it is from Mexico City to Dallas or from one\r\npoint to Mexico and from Mexico to that same point.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, that very easily could have become confused in\r\ntranslation, but it certainly is in there.*\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I think they have confused your question, Senator, I think\r\nthey have confused your question. I think they think that you were\r\nsaying that a round trip was cheaper than one way? Or--two ways?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I'm sorry, Mr. Gregory. You misunderstood it. I didn't\r\nmean that a round trip was cheaper than one way. I meant that a round\r\ntrip was cheaper than to go there and back on individual tickets--than\r\ntwo ways.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. She understood you correctly. I misunderstood you,\r\nSenator. I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The fact remains, according to Lee, that it is cheaper\r\nfrom Mexico--a one-way ticket from Mexico City, say, to Dallas costs\r\nless than from Dallas to Mexico, Mexico City. Or vice versa.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Be that as it may, how about the stub?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I found the stub of this ticket approximately 2 weeks ago\r\nwhen working with Priscilla Johnson on the book. Three weeks.\r\n\r\n*Three weeks ago--I found this stub of a ticket among old magazines,\r\nSpanish magazines, and there was a television program also in Spanish\r\nand there was the stub of this ticket.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. But this was, you know, a piece of paper and I didn't know\r\nthis was a ticket.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You didn't know it was a ticket?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Until you showed it to Miss Johnson?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes--it was in the TV book and then Mr. Liebeler called me\r\non telephone and asked me some questions about Mexico.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. And I told him, \"Just a minute, I'll go and inquire\r\nand tell him what I have,\" and I told him I have some kind of piece\r\nof paper. I don't know what it is. I don't know whether it would be\r\ninterested--the Commission, and somebody who was at my house one\r\ntime----\r\n\r\n*Read what was on the stub.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You could read the stub all right, could you, Mrs.\r\nOswald? There wasn't anything complicated there, you could read\r\n\"One-way ticket,\" couldn't you? You know that much English?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It was a mixture of Spanish and English.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Oh, I see--it had it both ways, and the name of the\r\nbus company, too, perhaps.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I didn't understand this in languages--you can't say this.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Where had that magazine been that had this bus ticket\r\nin it, was anything else in it, any tickets to bull fights or anywhere\r\nelse?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I turned all of this material over to the FBI, thinking\r\nthat they might find something of interest in it. I did not try to\r\ndetermine for myself what it was.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Was it in the possessions that were removed from Mrs.\r\nPaine's room, or was it in some of Lee's material that was moved from\r\nhis boardinghouse?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was with Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Didn't you testify, Mrs. Oswald, that Lee couldn't\r\nread Spanish, when you were testifying before? What was he doing with a\r\nSpanish magazine?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It wasn't a Spanish magazine, it was a TV program.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It was a TV program.\r\n\r\n*It was not a Spanish magazine, it was a TV program.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Oh, it was not a magazine, it was a TV program. I\r\nunderstood you to say it was a Spanish magazine? I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I found all this among my old magazines and newspapers,\r\nthat I was collecting after the assassination of the President, and\r\nthere also were English books which could have been in that small\r\nsuitcase in which I put everything.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. How did the FBI happen to overlook that when they\r\nmade the raid out there at Mrs. Paine's? I thought they carried off\r\neverything you had out there, practically?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The reason they overlooked this particular suitcase is\r\nbecause I took it with me to----\r\n\r\n**To the hotel--the first night they moved us.\r\n\r\n*When we stayed in the hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was in Dallas.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. It was in Dallas. That's when they were at the big\r\nhotel--where you spent one night there?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It was in Dallas and I took it with me because there were\r\nchildren's books.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I thought the FBI had already removed your passports\r\nand your diploma and everything before that time?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The first day when Lee was arrested, the FBI made a\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. The FBI or police.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. The FBI or police.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I believe it was the police then.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The police made the search in the Paine's house.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. And everything was there. I did not take anything with me\r\nthat first day when I was arrested.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When you returned to Mrs. Paine's you found they had\r\nleft this particular program there with this bus stub? You testified\r\nthey had removed your passport and your diploma and Lee's union cards\r\nand Social Security card and everything else--I was just wondering how\r\nthey happened to leave this particular article with the bus stub in it?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **I never retained that for any special reason.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I'm quite sure of that. I wasn't asking that at all.**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **I don't know the reason.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. They just overlooked that?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **It was just overlooked--the same way they overlooked\r\nthat other.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, what are your relations now with the\r\nfriends that you made in the Russian community here in Dallas? I\r\ndon't remember all of the names--one of them was named Elena Hall,\r\nis that right, and Katya Ford, Anna Meller, De Mohrenschildt, De\r\nMohrenschildt's wife and children--are you still on friendly terms with\r\nthem, do you see them occasionally?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. As far as I'm concerned, I consider all of them as my\r\nfriends, but George Bouhe, and Katya Ford are the only two people that\r\ncome to visit me. Others perhaps feel that it is not healthy for them\r\nto come to see me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I wondered if they had expressed their opinion or\r\nwhether they were afraid of you on account of publicity contamination?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No, they never said that to me personally that they are\r\nafraid to come to see me. When we meet in the church, they are all very\r\npleasant to me, but they never invite me.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No.\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Sometimes they invite Katya Ford, but they never invite\r\nme. Nataska Krassovska is very nice to me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When was the first time you ever heard of Jack Ruby or\r\nJack Rubenstein?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. When he killed him.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You had never heard of him until that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. (Nodding a negative response.)\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That's all.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What is your address now, Mrs. Oswald, and with whom do\r\nyou live?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. 629 Belt Line Road, Richardson, Tex.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Does someone live with you or do you live with someone?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; I live by myself with my children.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. After the death of your husband, you had a lawyer, Mr.\r\nThorne, and a business agent, Mr. Martin, and they were discharged. Was\r\nthere any particular reason for discharging them?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I got rid of them because the contract that they prepared\r\nwas unfair to me, and it was prepared at a time when I did not\r\nunderstand it and when it was not translated to me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, you later employed Mr. McKenzie as your attorney\r\nand you have since discharged him, haven't you?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I employed Mr. McKenzie to wind up the affair with Mr.\r\nMartin and Mr. Thorne, and he was not employed on any other basis--just\r\nfor that particular thing.\r\n\r\n**Not permanently.\r\n\r\n*Not permanently--just for that particular thing, despite the fact\r\nthat he did give advice on other business of mine. Of course, I needed\r\nan attorney in my dealings with the Commission that's what he told\r\nme--that I needed an attorney to deal with the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. She said----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. She said more than that.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Now, as I feel now, I don't need any lawyer before the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. If you'll just answer my question now: Do you have a\r\nlawyer to represent you now?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who is your business agent?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Mrs. Katya Ford.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you tell the Commission about how much money has\r\nbeen donated to you or how much you have earned through contracts?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know at this time how much money I have.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Approximately?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Donations were $57,000, from which twelve and one-half\r\nthousand plus expenses were paid to Martin and Thorne, and $15,000 to\r\nMr. McKenzie.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you have any contracts, have you made any contracts\r\nfor the sale of your writings which may be payable in the future?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The publishing company contract with me is all.\r\n\r\n*I have not signed any contracts with the publishing company, except I\r\nhave already signed several contracts with Life Magazine.\r\n\r\nAfter the diary was published.\r\n\r\n**After the diary was published.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That's for $20,000?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. $20,000 plus $1,000 for Parade Magazine, and one\r\ngirl--Helen--I don't know her last name, I know we did----\r\n\r\n*Also, I signed--I agreed with a girl by the name of Helen--I cannot\r\nremember her last name, for possible future stories Helen might write.\r\n\r\nWe have interview.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You testified that your uncle is an official and a\r\nColonel in the MVD?* ** And, a member of the Communist Party, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know that any other members of your family are\r\nmembers of the Communist Party?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The husband of another aunt.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that the aunt you visited from time to time?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. At Kharkov?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. At Minsk.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. With whom did you file your declaration for an exit\r\nvisa?** *\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. There is a special institution in Minsk where prospective\r\ndepartees filed application for exit visa. They leave the application\r\nin that institution, and that institution transmits it to Moscow where\r\nthe decision is made whether to grant or to deny the exit permit. The\r\nreply then comes to the MVD in Minsk.\r\n\r\n*I want to assure the Commission that I was never given any assignment\r\nby the Soviet Government or the American Government, and that I was so\r\nsurprised myself that I got the exit visa.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you talked to Colonel Aksenov, what did he tell\r\nyou when you asked him about the exit visa?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When I went to see Colonel Aksenov, I went to ask him\r\nabout the state in which my application is for exit visa, and he\r\nreplied----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No. \"Was it favorable or not,\" and he said it was\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, and he said----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. That it takes official process of getting the answer.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He said, \"You are not the only one who is seeking exit\r\npermit, and so you have to wait your turn.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he attempt to discourage you from seeking the exit\r\nvisa?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did Lee Oswald ever express any opinion to you as to\r\nwhy he thought an exit visa might be granted to you and your daughter?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He encouraged me and he thought that I would consider\r\nthat he exerted every effort on his part for me to get this exit. Maybe\r\nhe just was saying that that way, but never hoped that actually I would\r\nget the exit permit.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. During that time or at any other time, did Lee ever\r\nsay to you that he might do some work for the Soviet Union if you did\r\nreturn to the United States?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I would like to turn to your testimony about your\r\nknowledge of the rifle that Lee possessed. Now, as I remember your\r\ntestimony, you stated that you first learned that he had the rifle\r\nearly in 1963.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. In the year that he bought it, I learned it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You had seen him clean it, you had watched him sight\r\nthe rifle in New Orleans and work the bolt?* **\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. In New Orleans?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes; in your testimony, you said you saw him sitting on\r\nthe little back porch----\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. On the little back porch--yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And sight the rifle?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I'm sorry, I might be mixed up.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you testified that you believed he did some target\r\npractice at least a few times?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. In Dallas or New Orleans?* **\r\n\r\n*Yes; when we lived on Neely Street.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He told you that he had used this rifle to fire at\r\nGeneral Walker?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He told you he had threatened Vice President Nixon, you\r\nhad said?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not say \"Vice President Nixon,\" he just said\r\n\"Nixon.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, was it your opinion throughout these months that\r\nhe was keeping this rifle for his purpose of using it again, firing at\r\nsome individual, perhaps an official of the United States Government?*\r\n**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **He never expressed himself.\r\n\r\n*When the assassination of President Kennedy took place, I was asking\r\npeople whether--people in general--whether General Walker was with\r\nPresident Kennedy. It perhaps was a silly question, but I thought that\r\nhe----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Listen to my question: During this time, didn't you\r\nhave the opinion that he was keeping possession of this rifle and\r\npracticing with it for the purpose of using it to shoot at some\r\nindividual, and perhaps an official of the United States Government?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I never thought--I was afraid to think that he would do\r\nanything like that until the shooting of General Walker occurred.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But now my question. After that--the continued\r\npossession----* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. After the attempting of the killing of General Walker,\r\nI thought he might do it, but I didn't visualize that he could do\r\nanything like that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you testified before the Commission, you\r\nsaid--generally--you didn't think Lee would repeat anything like\r\nthat--\"Generally, I knew that the rifle was very tempting for him\".\r\n\r\n\"Very tempting for him\"--what did you mean by that, about the rifle\r\nbeing very tempting for him? Did you believe he might be tempted to\r\nshoot at someone else?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; I was afraid that he did have temptation to kill\r\nsomeone else.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mrs. Oswald, you testified that when you talked to Lee\r\nafter he had shot at General Walker, or told you he had shot at General\r\nWalker, he said that it would have been well if someone had killed\r\nHitler because many lives would be saved, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. After that, you testified that many times or a number\r\nof times he read you articles about President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And said at one time, discussing President Kennedy's\r\nfather, that he had made his money through wine and he had a great deal\r\nof money, and that enabled him to educate his sons and to give them a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nI want you to remember and tell the Commission if he did ever express\r\nany hatred or dislike for President Kennedy. You have several\r\ntimes--not changed--but you have told the Commission things you did not\r\ntell them when first asked.\r\n\r\nNow, if he did speak to you about President Kennedy, we think you\r\nshould tell the Commission?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I don't think he ever expressed hatred toward President\r\nKennedy, but perhaps he expressed jealousy, not only jealousy, but\r\nenvy, but perhaps he envied, because he said, \"Whoever has money has it\r\neasy.\" That was his general attitude. It was not a direct quotation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Pursuing this--I asked you that very question\r\nin Washington back in February, and the answer was \"No.\" I asked you\r\nwhether or not your husband ever expressed hostility toward President\r\nKennedy--is your answer still \"No\"?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. My answer is \"No.\"\r\n\r\n**He never expressed himself anything against President Kennedy,\r\nanything detrimental toward him. What I told them generally before, I\r\nam repeating now too.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ever indicate to you, except in the Walker\r\nsituation where he said he'd shot at General Walker, that he would kill\r\nanyone?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What about Nixon?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did tell me he was about ready to commit that\r\nparticular act, with respect to Nixon. That's when I kept him in the\r\nbathroom, but he never said, \"Well, today it's Walker and then I'm\r\ngoing to kill someone else.\" He never said that. He never related to me\r\nany of his plans about killing anybody.\r\n\r\n*In other words, he never said to me, \"Now, I'll kill Walker and then\r\nI'll kill this fellow\" and so on--he never did.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You testified that your husband said that he did\r\nnot like the United States for several reasons; one, because of\r\ncertain Fascist organizations; two, because of difficulty of securing\r\nemployment; and another reason--because of the high cost of medical\r\ncare. Did he ever say that those things that he did not like could be\r\nremedied or changed if an official of the Government were done away\r\nwith?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he never told me.\r\n\r\n**No; he never told me--he never told me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did any official of the Soviet Union, or any person\r\nwho was a Soviet citizen, ever talk to you or ever talk to Lee to your\r\nknowledge, during the time that you were in the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. At any time before or after?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You said--in the United States, didn't you?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes; in the United States.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; no one ever did. The only time Lee talked with a\r\nrepresentative of the Soviet Union was in Mexico, but not me and Lee,\r\nwe were never approached by the Soviet representatives.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When was the first time you ever heard of Police\r\nOfficer Tippit?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When there was a broadcast over the radio that Officer\r\nTippit was killed.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you seen Mrs. Paine since the time you left her\r\nhome after the assassination?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nI saw her twice since I left Irving, since I lived with her in Irving.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When was that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Once, when I lived with Katya Ford in February of this\r\nyear, and the next time I do not recall--maybe 1 month later.\r\n\r\nIn my house.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You had quite an association with her, and I need not\r\nrecall all of the facts, but is there any reason now that you do not\r\nwish to see her?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. One of the reasons is that she belongs to the Civil\r\nLiberties Union and I don't want to get mixed up in anything. I already\r\nhave plenty of grief.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Just one other question--is there any other fact about\r\nthis subject, which you have been asked by the Commission or by anyone\r\nelse that you have knowledge of that you have not told us about it? Any\r\nfact that would bear on this inquiry?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I would be glad to, but I don't know of any.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. May I just ask one or two questions?\r\n\r\nHave you seen Mrs. Marguerite Oswald at any time since you first\r\nappeared before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Have you heard from her?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You've had no communication from her either\r\ndirectly or indirectly?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\n*She tried to get in touch with me.\r\n\r\n**Through Attorney McKenzie.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And you refused to see her?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*I think that she may have been bad influence with the\r\nchildren--improper influence with the children.\r\n\r\n**I feel that--I hardly believe--that Lee Oswald really tried to kill\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I feel in my own mind that Lee did not have President\r\nKennedy as a prime target when he assassinated him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, who was it?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I think it was Connally. That's my personal opinion that\r\nhe perhaps was shooting at Governor Connally, the Governor of Texas.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You've testified before us before that Lee told you he\r\nwas coming back to Texas--if he was back in Texas, he would vote for\r\nConnally for Governor. Why do you think he would shoot him?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **I feel that the reason that he had Connally in his mind\r\nwas on account of his discharge from the Marines and various letters\r\nthey exchanged between the Marine Corps and the Governor's office, but\r\nactually, I didn't think that he had any idea concerning President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Well, now, my next question is--did he ever\r\nexpress any hostility to Governor Connally?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He never expressed that to me--his displeasure or hatred\r\nof Connally, but I feel that there could have been some connection, due\r\nto the fact that Lee was dishonorably discharged from the Corps, and\r\nthere was an exchange of letters between the Governor's Office and Lee.\r\nThat's my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Just a minute. Excuse me, Senator.\r\n\r\nI asked you in February, Mrs. Oswald, I said, \"What motive would\r\nyou ascribe to your husband in killing President Kennedy?\" And, you\r\nsaid, \"As I saw the documents that were being read to me, I came to\r\nthe conclusion that he wanted by any means, good or bad to get into\r\nhistory, and now that I've read a part of the translation of some of\r\nthe documents, I think that there was some political foundation to it,\r\na foundation of which I am not aware.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then you go on and you express no doubt in your mind that he\r\nintended to kill President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **Did I say that, this last time in Dallas? The last time\r\nin Dallas, apparently there was some misunderstanding on the part of my\r\nanswers to the Commission, because I was told by Mr. McKenzie that it\r\nwasn't reported accurately.\r\n\r\n*The record should read that on the basis of the documents that I have\r\nread, I have no doubt--that I had available to me to read--I had no\r\ndoubt that he did----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. That he could kill him----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Could or have wanted to--could have wanted to----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. He could kill--she doesn't say \"want\"--he could have\r\nkilled him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Let's straighten this out because this is very\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Okay.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I'll read it to you, \"I gather that you have\r\nreached the conclusion in your own mind that your husband killed\r\nPresident Kennedy?\" You replied, \"Regretfully--yes.\"\r\n\r\nNow, do you have any reason to change that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That's correct. I have no doubt that he did kill the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Now, the other answer as I read it was: \"On\r\nthe basis of documents that you had seen presented at the Commission\r\nhearing\"--isn't that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **The word \"documents\" is wrong--the facts\r\npresented--that's what I mean.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Again we get back to the question of motive.\r\nYou said again today that you are convinced that Lee Oswald killed\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nYou said something additionally today, though, and that is that you\r\nfeel that it was his intention not to kill President Kennedy, but to\r\nkill Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nNow, am I correct in saying that she had not said this previously?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Ask her that.* **\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Let's get an answer. I think this answer is quite\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. On the basis of all the available facts, I have no doubt\r\nin my mind that Lee Oswald killed President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n*At the same time, I feel in my own mind as far as I am concerned,\r\nI feel that Lee--that my husband perhaps intended to kill Governor\r\nConnally instead of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Now, let me ask you one other question: Assuming\r\nthat this is correct, would you feel that there would be any less guilt\r\nin killing Governor Connally than in killing the President?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I am not trying to vindicate or justify or excuse Lee as\r\nmy husband. Even if he killed one of his neighbors, still it wouldn't\r\nmake much difference--it wouldn't make any difference--a killing is a\r\nkilling. I am sorry.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. There are one or two other questions I want to\r\nask her.\r\n\r\nI know you've been asked a lot of questions about this thing. How old\r\nwere you when you left Russia?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Twenty years. My birthday--I was 21 when I came here. In\r\nJuly--my birthday was in July.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you a member of the Communist Party in\r\nRussia?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\n*I was a member of a Komsomol organization.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What is that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It is an association of young Communist youth. It is not\r\nparty, sir. In order to become a member of the Communist Party, one\r\nhas to be first a member of the Komsomol, but I didn't even have the\r\nmembership card in Komsomol Association.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Would it be normal for one to graduate, so to\r\nspeak, from the Komsomol to the membership in the Communist Party?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It is a prerequisite for a prospective member of the\r\nCommunist Party to be first a member of the Komsomol organization, but\r\nnot every member of Komsomol becomes a Communist Party member.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What percentage?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. She was expelled?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. No; she testified she quit the Youth Movement.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I was dismissed.\r\n\r\n**I was expelled from Komsomol.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Why--for what reason?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The reason given to me for being expelled from Komsomol\r\nwas because I did not get my card, because I did not take out my\r\nKomsomol card for 1 year. That was the reason given to me, but I\r\nbelieve the true reason why they expelled me from Komsomol was because\r\nI married an American.\r\n\r\nIt also happened about the time when I visited the American Embassy. I\r\nwas expelled the following week after I visited the American Embassy in\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you pay any dues to the Komsomol?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; 30¢\r\n\r\n*Yes; 30¢ every month.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I thought that practically all young people belonged\r\nto the Komsomol?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. There are many more of them than there are members of\r\nthe Communist Party, aren't there?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Nearly every city in Russia has a big building, there\r\nis a Youth Komsomol Building?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; I was persuaded or talked into joining the Komsomol\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I thought that was automatic?**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\n*No--one has to be accepted into Komsomol. It is not automatic.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. One further question, and this is off the record.\r\n\r\n(Interrogatories and answers off the record at this point.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. In response to Senator Russell, I gathered that\r\nyou plan to stay in the United States?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; if possible.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you aspire to become a citizen of the United\r\nStates, or are you a citizen?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I am not a citizen. I wish to become an American citizen.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, when you were before us before, you\r\ntestified that you were not a member of any church, but you had your\r\nown religion in your own heart, as I recall?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. In Russia I did not belong to any church. No one belongs\r\nto any church in Russia.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Except old women?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I'll say this--that I believe it's unhealthy in the\r\nSoviet Union to openly belong to any church. While there is no\r\npersecution of religious belief in Russia, the officials look at it\r\nwith much disfavor.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you are not actually a member of the church, are\r\nyou?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. In Russian churches, they don't have a fee or they don't\r\nhave any membership, they have dues in Russian churches.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you've not been baptized in any church?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Oh, yes; I have been baptized.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When were you baptized?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Are you actually a member of the church?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Actually, I am not a member as you know in the United\r\nStates. However, I belong to the church, the Russian church here in\r\nDallas, and I don't pay dues.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You are more of a communicant now than you are a\r\nmember of the church?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I think the understanding of church membership is\r\ndifferent in the Soviet Union or in the understanding of a person that\r\nwas brought up in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I am concerned about this testimony, Mrs. Oswald,\r\nabout your believing now that Lee was shooting at Connally and not at\r\nthe President, because you did not tell us that before.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. At that time I didn't think so, but the more I mull over\r\nit in my own mind trying to get it in my own mind what made him do what\r\nhe did, the more I think that he was shooting at Connally rather than\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, did you not testify before that Lee wrote a\r\nletter to Connally when he was Secretary of the Navy about the nature\r\nof his Marine discharge?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And that when he got a letter back, that you asked him\r\nwhat it was?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And he said, \"Well, it's just some Bureaucrat's\r\nstatement\"?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you not further testify that Lee said in\r\ndiscussing the gubernatorial election in Texas that if he were here and\r\nvoting, that he would vote for Mr. Connally?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Now, do you think he would shoot and kill a man that\r\nhe would vote for, for the Governor of his state?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. The only reason is--I am trying to analyze, myself,\r\nthere was a reason--more reason to dislike Connally as a man than he\r\nhad for Kennedy.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, she testified before that he had spoken, as far\r\nas Lee spoke favorably of anyone, that he had spoken favorably of both\r\nKennedy and of Governor Connally.**\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. He also told me that he was also favorable toward\r\nConnally, while they were in Russia. There is a possibility that he\r\nchanged his mind, but he never told her that.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, I think that's about as speculative as the\r\nanswers I've read here. He might have changed his mind, but he didn't\r\ntell her anything about it, as she testified--that discussing politics\r\nin Texas, that he said that if he were here when they had the election,\r\nthat he would vote for John Connally for Governor, and that was after\r\nhe got the letter about the Marine corps.* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. That happened in Russia when he received some kind of\r\npamphlet with a picture of Connally, a separate time, at which time he\r\nremarked that when he returned, if and when he returned to Texas he\r\nwould vote for Connally.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That's right--that's exactly right, but yet now you\r\nsay that he was his prime target.\r\n\r\nI want to know what Connally had done to Lee since he got back from\r\nRussia that would cause him to change his mind, to shoot him?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know, but there is a possibility that Lee became\r\nhateful of Connally because the matter of this dishonorable discharge\r\nwas dragging so long.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes; but Connally had left the Navy, where he had\r\nanything to do with the discharge, before he got the pamphlet about his\r\nbeing a candidate for Governor?** *\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. I am not sure when that particular thing happened,\r\nwhether Mr. Connally was the Secretary of the Navy or what he was doing.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, it's a matter of common knowledge that he ran\r\nfor Governor after he resigned as Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I don't know.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you not know that when Mr. Connally was running\r\nfor Governor of Texas, he was no longer Secretary of the Navy and had\r\nnothing to do with the Marine Corps?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes, I knew--I knew that he was not the Secretary of the\r\nNavy any more because Lee told me that Connally stated in the letter to\r\nLee that he was no longer Secretary of Navy and hence he couldn't do\r\nanything for him, and that Connally referred the petition to the proper\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Mrs. Oswald, didn't Lee read about government a great\r\ndeal? Didn't Lee read about civic affairs and about government a great\r\ndeal?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He read books about Kennedy, about Hitler, about others.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Haven't you been in this country long enough to know\r\nthat the President is Commander and Chief of the Army and Navy and he's\r\neven head of the Secretary of the Navy. He can order him to do anything\r\nhe wants to?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I didn't pay any attention to it or I didn't know it or\r\nwasn't told.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you have any facts on which you base your opinion\r\nnow that Lee Oswald was shooting and was intending to kill Connally\r\nrather than President Kennedy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I have no facts whatsoever. I simply express an opinion\r\nwhich perhaps is not logical at all, but I am sorry if I mixed\r\neverybody up.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. You haven't mixed anybody up, except I think that you\r\nhave your evidence terribly confused.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I have no facts whatsover. I'm sorry I told them that.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Do you know whether or not Lee knew Connally\r\npersonally or did he know that he was going to be in this motorcade at\r\nall?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; I did not know whether Lee knew or ever contacted\r\nthe Governor personally, and I don't know whether Lee knew that the\r\nGovernor would be in the motorcade.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But Lee did take his gun into town that day, and so\r\nfar as you know, I believe you said that was the first day he had\r\ncarried it into town?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not personally know that Lee took the rifle that\r\nmorning or the night before. Apparently the Commission has witnesses or\r\ninformation to that effect, but of my own knowledge, I don't know.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did you not testify that you thought this was Lee's\r\nrifle that was shown you as the one that shot Connally and the\r\nPresident?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; I testified that that was the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No--I'm sorry. As far as she knows about the arms, the\r\nrifle which was shown to her looked like the one he had.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; that's right.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That's all I asked her. That's just exactly what I\r\nasked her.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; that's correct.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. In discussing the motorcade, did he say anything about\r\nConnally would be riding with the President?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I believe you testified, did you not, Mrs. Oswald,\r\nthat the day before Lee told you that he fired at General Walker, that\r\nhe seemed to be under great emotional stress, strain, very tense?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was angry and excited. He was angry and excited.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Did he show any of that on the morning that he left\r\nhome when the President was assassinated?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Well, I did not notice any difference in Lee's attitude\r\nduring that morning from any other day. But sometimes, quite often, he\r\nwas impulsive and nervous and excited. I got tired from watching him in\r\nthose particular moods, in his moods, and I didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Why did you happen to watch him then on the morning\r\nthat he shot at General Walker?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I simply--his mood left no impression on me that\r\nparticular morning. There was nothing extraordinary about it.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. On the Walker morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No, no--on the morning of the President's assassination.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes, but you said you noticed it on the morning before\r\nhe shot Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Are you talking about Walker?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. If you didn't notice his moods, how did you happen to\r\nnotice it on the day before he shot at General Walker?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The reason I didn't notice that particular morning about\r\nhis mood was because the night before we had a little quarrel and I\r\ndidn't pay any attention to that, particularly, and I was thinking that\r\nit was due to that quarrel we had the night before.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Well, of course, that was the quarrel you had about\r\nhim registering under an assumed name or giving an assumed name at his\r\nroom.**\r\n\r\nWas that not the time, did you not try to telephone him and they told\r\nyou that no such person stayed there at all?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That was the cause of the quarrel. You see, at this\r\nparticular morning of the assassination, I was very tired because the\r\nbaby woke up several times during the night and I was very tired, and\r\nin the morning I did not register or I did not even attempt to register\r\nhis moods.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I think you testified before that you only saw him\r\nwhen he got up, that you stayed in bed and that he got up and fixed his\r\nown coffee and got out.* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The only extraordinary thing that I noticed about him the\r\nmorning of the assassination was that when Lee was leaving the house,\r\nhe asked me if I purchased a pair of shoes.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. For June?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. For me.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And for June?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. And for the baby.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And for June?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. And that was the only thing that was extraordinary, and I\r\nwondered what was happening that he became, that he was so kind all of\r\na sudden.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. That was out of the money in the black wallet, too?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\n*Yes--that was a fleeting thought in my mind of why the change in him.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But apparently he was not as excited and as upset as\r\nhe was the morning before the Walker shooting?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was just as usual--sort of sleepy that particular\r\nmorning. He was not excited. Then, I was so sleepy myself that I didn't\r\npay any attention.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. But you did testify that he was unusually excited the\r\nnight before he shot at General walker, did you not?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. The more time is passing, the more I am mixed up as\r\nto the exact occurrence. I'm forgetting these fine details with the\r\npassing of time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if we could take a 5-minute recess?\r\nThe reporter has been at it a long time?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Oh, yes; I don't know how she's stood it. I've never\r\nseen one in the Congress that took it anything like that long.\r\n\r\nThe REPORTER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And we will let you have a 5 minute recess, Mrs. Oswald.\r\n\r\n(At this point the proceedings were recessed and resumed as stated, at\r\n6:40 p.m., Sunday, September 6, 1964.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald, you have not appeared here today with a lawyer, have you?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have not, is that right? You have no lawyer with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you appeared before the Commission the other two\r\ntimes, you did have a lawyer with you, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes--the other two times.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there some reason why you do not have a lawyer at this\r\ntime?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That attorney cost me too much.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And--before this hearing, Mrs. Oswald, we offered to, that\r\nis the Commission offered to furnish you an attorney if you wanted one\r\nto be supplied to you for this hearing, did it not?* **\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. You did so?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I understood that that message was given to you by the\r\nSecret Service that we would ask for the appointment of counsel to\r\nattend the meeting with you, if you wished it, and you said you didn't\r\nneed it, you would just tell the truth?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Mr. Sorrels called me on telephone and he asked me if I\r\nhave a lawyer, an attorney, and I said, \"No,\" and he told me, \"Do I\r\nwant to have one?\" and I said, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And you understood that you would be supplied a lawyer if\r\nyou wanted one and you said you didn't, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You referred to the fact, when you were asked, that your\r\nhusband had a rifle in the Soviet Union while he was there. In your\r\nprior testimony, you referred to either a rifle or a shotgun, do you\r\nknow which it was?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know the difference between the shotgun and the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know that he had one or the other?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I know that there is a difference between this particular\r\nrifle and another rifle, but I don't know what the difference is. It\r\nwas perhaps a different color.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know that in the Soviet Union he did have either a\r\nrifle or a shotgun, do you?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Turning to the period when you were in New Orleans, just\r\nbefore you went back to Dallas with Ruth Paine, do you recall that\r\ntime?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes--faintly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember that was the latter part of September?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. **Possibly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember what date you went back to Dallas from New\r\nOrleans?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It wasn't the 26th of September?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Wasn't it about the 23d of September that you went back?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The 23d?\r\n\r\n*I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember that you had a discussion with your husband\r\nabout the unemployment check that he was to receive about that time?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I remember Lee told me that he was expecting an\r\nunemployment check just before he left for Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he tell you that he had changed the postal address and\r\nthat that check would probably come to Ruth Paine's?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me that he was going to change his address and\r\nthat the letters would come to that new address of Ruth Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did the unemployment check ever come to Ruth Paine's?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. When he returned from Mexico, he asked me if the\r\nunemployment check arrived, and I replied that I did not know. No;\r\nthere was no check.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about getting the check at New Orleans\r\nand cashing it himself?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not remember it right now, but if I mentioned that\r\nto the Commission before, then it was so.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any recollection about it now?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not recall distinctly now, but I think there was\r\nsome conversation about the check being long in transit, that the check\r\nwas sent from Dallas to New Orleans and from New Orleans to Irving.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well apparently, Mrs. Oswald, the facts show that the check\r\nwas cashed by your husband with a stamped mark of the bank, dated the\r\n26th of September, in New Orleans. Does that refresh your memory at\r\nall?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I was not with Lee at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he ever tell you anything about it?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not remember at this moment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Apparently he cashed the check at the little store, or the\r\nsupermarket, near where you lived there in New Orleans. Did he every\r\ntell you that?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not tell me. I do not remember that he told me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did Lee ever tell you where he stayed the night after you\r\nleft, that is, the night of the 23d of September?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me that he stayed in that same house.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. At the house where you had lived?**\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. He stayed with his aunt. I remember something that he\r\nstayed a couple days with his aunt in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n*Did I leave on the 23d?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not recall distinctly at this moment, but I believe\r\nhe said he spent the first night at the house where we lived, and\r\nperhaps one or two nights at Aunt Lillian's.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there something else?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It is so difficult for me to remember now.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did your husband have any Cuban friends at New Orleans?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you remember the time a man by the name of Bringuier\r\ncame to the house there? Bringuier [spelling] B-r-i-n-g-u-i-e-r.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Someone came, but I don't know from which organization or\r\nwho he was.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was there more than one person who came asking about that\r\nor only one?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Just one.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall that your husband hired someone to help hand\r\nout leaflets about fair play for Cuba on the streets of New Orleans?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He mentioned that he hired a boy to help him, by giving\r\nhim some money to buy ice cream or something--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I'll hand you what is marked as Frank Pizzo Exhibit No.\r\n453-A, which is a photograph, and ask you if you recognize your husband\r\nthere, and also, any of the other men there in the picture?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD (examining instrument mentioned). I recognize only my\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is your husband the man with the marks that sort of look\r\nlike a \"T\" in light green?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I ask you if you recognize anyone besides your husband in\r\nFrank Pizzo Exhibit No. 453-B?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No. *No. [Examining instrument mentioned.] No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But you do recognize your husband there?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He has a green mark over his photograph, does he not?\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether or not your husband consulted any\r\nattorneys in New Orleans while he was there?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of a Clay Bertrand, [spelling] B-e-r-t-r-a-n-d?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did your husband ever say anything about consulting an\r\nattorney about his discharge from the Marines or about his American\r\ncitizenship?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know whether or not your husband was in Dallas in\r\nSeptember between the 23d, the date that you left with Mrs. Paine, and\r\nthe 26th of September--at any time?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he ever say anything about anything like that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever know a Sylvia Odio, [spelling] O-d-i-o?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You never heard of her?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Sylvia Odio is a woman in Dallas who said that your\r\nhusband, along with two Cubans, came to see her under the name \"Leon\r\nOswald,\" on the evening of the 25th or the 26th of September 1963. Do\r\nyou know anything about that?*\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. No; I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Have you ever heard of her?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever hear of a person by the name of Rodriguez\r\n[Spelling] R-o-d-r-i-g-u-e-z, that your husband was said to have known\r\nin New Orleans, while you were there? Do you know whether your husband\r\never knew a Rodriguez [spelling] R-o-d-r-i-g-u-e-z in New Orleans?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He may have known him, but I don't know anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He never told you that he knew anyone like that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not tell me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you lived in New Orleans and after your husband lost\r\nhis job, did he stay away from home in the evenings much?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was not at home during the day time, but he was at\r\nhome most of the time in the evenings.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And by being at home in the evenings, what time do you\r\nmean--from 6 o'clock on, or 7 o'clock, or what time?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. After 7.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he ever show signs of having been drinking or being\r\ndrunk when he came home?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Never.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he ever talk about having seen some friends or some\r\nCubans or Mexicans in the bar or some bar in New Orleans?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; it's strange for me to hear that Lee visited bars or\r\nthat he drank.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know of his drinking at all in New Orleans?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I never did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He was arrested in connection with the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nmatter around August 9, if you will recall. You may not remember the\r\nexact date, but I refresh your memory and call your attention to the\r\nfact that it was that date--August 9?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did that come to your attention, how did you learn\r\nabout it?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That night I waited for him until 3 o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Then, I went to bed. When he came in the morning, I asked him\r\nwhere he had been and he told me he was arrested by the police.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Had he stayed out all night that way before?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It hadn't ever happened before?**\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You say it never happened that he would even stay out late\r\nin the evening?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. No; sometimes he was delayed, but he would be home by 9\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you ever hear your husband say anything about being\r\nassociated with any pro-Castro or anti-Castro groups in Dallas?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I didn't know that he belonged to any organization in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you know of any such associations or any associations\r\nwith Cubans after he returned from Mexico City?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he ever mention Sylvia Odio to you or any name like\r\nthat, that you recall?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, when you testified before the Commission before, you\r\nwere asked what kind of a job your husband had at the Minsk factory, do\r\nyou recall that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said he read blueprints and translated them into the\r\nfinished product. Do you remember your husband saying anything like\r\nthat to you?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I don't think I testified to that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You don't recall testifying to that?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. I testified that he was a--slesar.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Off the record, please?\r\n\r\nShe names a trade and that Russian word stands for locksmith, but I\r\nknow that he was not a locksmith, I mean, from the description of work\r\nthat he was doing. He was working at a factory where he was assembling\r\ndetails for--metallic details. He was a machinist apprentice working on\r\nparts for radio receivers.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He told the FBI at one time in one of the interviews that\r\nhe was busy reading blueprints and translating them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, are you telling me what she says his job was or are you\r\ntelling me what you know?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No; she's telling me, but Mrs. Oswald tells me that the\r\ntechnical name of his job was the Russian word (spelling) s-l-e-s-a-r'.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, will you describe, Mrs. Oswald, what he did in that\r\njob so it will be clearer than just that word. Tell us what he did?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I have never been at the plant where Lee worked or in any\r\nfactory, but from the description that Lee gave me----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Tell us that?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He was grinding details--detailed parts for small parts,\r\nsmall metallic parts for radio receivers, on a lathe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was boasting about the importance of his work when he told\r\nyou about reading the blueprints and translating them into the finished\r\nproduct. He may have actually done that kind of work, but I know\r\nnothing about that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was the only work that he told you he was doing during the\r\nperiod that you were there in Minsk, this job of grinding these parts\r\non the lathe?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. While he and I lived together--yes. That was the kind of\r\nwork that he was doing in Minsk.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And that's all that you know of?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That's all I know about his work.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, turning to the period that your husband was in Moscow\r\nin 1959 when he first came there, and, of course, you were married\r\nlater than that, did he tell you about his experiences when he first\r\ncame to Moscow?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me that for the most part he visited museums and\r\nstudied the Russian language.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about the intourist guides, the women\r\nstudied the Russian language.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The Russian guides?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he tell you about any of the others that he knew there?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did, but I don't remember their names, except Rimma.\r\nThe only reason I remember Rimma Sherikova is because she visited us\r\nin Minsk. She did not come especially to see us, but she was passing\r\nthrough Minsk and stopped to see us.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did your husband tell you about Rimma?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That she was a very fine, pretty, smart young girl, and\r\nunfortunately, older than he is, and that she helped him a great deal.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he tell you how she helped him?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. First of all, as an interpreter.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What else?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. And that he spent time with her and did not feel lonesome.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about Rimma or the other intourist\r\nguides helping him with learning Russian?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say how much they did that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about the guides helping him in dealing\r\nwith the Embassy about his citizenship or giving up his citizenship?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not tell me about that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say anything about the guides giving him any\r\nfinancial help?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not tell me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did your husband say anything about when he learned that he\r\nmight be able to stay in Russia, how he learned it?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he did not. He, Lee, took part in radio broadcasts,\r\npropaganda in favor of the Soviet Union, which he felt helped him to\r\nget permission to stay in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did he say when he did that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. That was before my time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How did you learn about it?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He told me about it. Lee told me that the Soviet Union\r\noffered him Soviet citizenship, but he turned it down. He told me\r\nthat he turned it down. At the same time, other developments as I\r\nrecall, left the impression with me that he actually wanted to become\r\na Soviet citizen, but I didn't connect the two. There is a discrepancy\r\nbetween the two, but at the time, I couldn't reconcile these apparent\r\ndifferences in what he said.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You know he told the reporters that he talked to in\r\nMoscow in November, that the Government was going to let him stay,\r\nbut his diary says he didn't get that word until January the 4th of\r\nthe following year. Now, do you know anything about that, how that\r\nhappened?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. 1960?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. 1959 in November is when he told the reporters, and it was\r\nJanuary 4, 1960, that he actually put it in his diary that he had the\r\nfirst learning of it?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. That they would let him stay in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Newspaper reporters?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes; newspaper reporters--Miss Johnson and Miss Mosby.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He made the entry into his diary, I think, at a later\r\ndate, and they may not be correct or precise--just one.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I think she's a little tired. She's saying many words, but\r\nI can't connect them. She says, \"To be brief, I don't believe I know.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We will soon be through, Mrs. Oswald. There are just a few\r\nmore questions.*\r\n\r\nWhen your husband said that he had spoken over the radio and he thought\r\nthat helped him, did he tell you what he said over the radio?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He spoke over the radio of how everything--how wonderful\r\neverything was in the Soviet Union, or what he thought they liked to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did you understand that he spoke that in Moscow while\r\nhe was there?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; while he was in Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That was during the period after he had first come to the\r\ncountry and before he came to Minsk, is that right?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, do you recall any more than you have told us about the\r\ntime you had the interview with the MVD about your visa--what they said\r\nto you and what you said to them?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. First of all, Colonel Aksenov asked me why I wanted to go\r\nto America, \"Is it so bad here that you want to leave?\" And I replied\r\nthat I wanted to go to America with my husband and that I believe that\r\nI have that right.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did they say to that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Then he said, \"You will simply have to wait because you\r\nare not the only one who wants to leave. You will have to wait your\r\nturn.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall anything else that was said at that time?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. At that time I was pregnant and Colonel Aksenov suggested\r\nthat may be it would be better for me to wait until the baby came.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say to that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I told him that I would prefer to leave as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that all you remember of the conversation?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Nothing of importance.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where did this conversation occur?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. In the MVD building in Minsk.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And who was present besides you and Colonel Aksenov?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. At first there were two military men who later left, and\r\nthey accompanied me or rather they showed me to the room where Colonel\r\nAksenov was. We were the only two in the room.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, your husband said that before you both left for the\r\nUnited States, he had an interview with the MVD. Do you recall that?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Before we left where?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Before you left the Soviet Union?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you recall anything like that while you were in Moscow\r\nbefore you left for the United States?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You were never told about anything like that by your\r\nhusband?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. By anyone else?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Nobody.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You were not present at any such meeting?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know of any meeting of that kind in Minsk?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He never told me that he had interviews.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. He said he quarreled with them trying to expedite the\r\nvisas, the exit permits, and where was that?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. In Minsk.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did he tell you whom he talked to when he quarreled\r\nwith them about the exit visas?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know their names, but all the people that were\r\nempowered with issuance of the exit permits.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Was that the time that you said he tried to get to see\r\nColonel Aksenov and they wouldn't let him?* **\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. It could have happened before we moved because he\r\napparently had a conversation with the Colonel.**\r\n\r\n**I remember it was cold.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. May I ask Marina--will you mind to read the question?\r\n\r\nThe REPORTER. \"Was that the time that you said he tried to get to see\r\nColonel Aksenov and they wouldn't let him?\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I was asking about the meeting with the MVD.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Lee meeting with the MVD in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes--about the exit visas.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. And you wanted to know the year and the month of the year?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No; I was first trying to find out what meeting she was\r\ntalking about and whether it was the one she referred to later.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. When she could not get the audience with the man?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That's right.* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It was approximately in January 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And did he tell you what happened at that meeting?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not meet with--he did not get to see Colonel\r\nAksenov.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But he did see someone else in there?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Apparently he talked to someone who substituted or was\r\ninferior to Colonel Aksenov.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And what did he tell you happened at that time?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Lee told me that when he came to MVD he asked to see\r\nColonel Aksenov, and the people in the office asked him the nature of\r\nthe business he wanted to discuss with him, and he told them that it\r\nwas about exit visas, and they told him that he could not see Aksenov,\r\nbut that they, whoever \"they\" were, were empowered to act on that\r\nquestion, but he insisted on seeing the colonel, and he did not get to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Then what happened?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Then he came home--then I went to MVD, then he sent me to\r\nMVD. I said, \"I don't want to go there and he said, \"I insist.\" Then, I\r\nwas afraid to go there, but I did go, and the Colonel did not eat me up.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did you talk to the colonel about both your visa and your\r\nhusband's at that time?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. The conversation with Colonel Aksenov was to find out why\r\nthe delay in the issuance of the exit permits.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That's all I have.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. There has been a good deal of testimony that you and\r\nyour husband were good friends with the De Mohrenschildt family?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is it correct that when he came to your house on one\r\noccasion that he saw the rifle, your husband's rifle?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this. It is possible that I have\r\nshown the rifle to them.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you remember when Mr. De Mohrenschildt said\r\nsomething like this after the Walker incident: \"How could you miss it?\"\r\nor something like that.*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. De Mohrenschildt--as soon as he opened the door, he said\r\nto Lee, \"How could you have missed, how could you have missed him?\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you have any explanation for that?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know whether Lee told De Mohrenschildt about\r\nshooting at Walker, and then Lee looked at me thinking--whether I told\r\nDe Mohrenschildt about it--I don't know. He even couldn't speak that\r\nevening. Lee could not speak that evening. We were on the porch.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he later ask you if you had told De Mohrenschildt?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He asked me if I told De Mohrenschildt about it and when\r\nI said I didn't, he said, \"How did he guess it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No; she said, \"Maybe you have told him.\"\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Then he said, \"Maybe you've told him about it\", and then\r\nhe added--he said, \"How did he guess it?\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. De Mohrenschildt said he had lived in Minsk, did he\r\never talk to you about Minsk?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he did say he lived in Minsk when he was a small\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You said also you heard them talking on occasions, that\r\nis, you heard Lee Oswald and De Mohrenschildt talking about Russia, did\r\nyou hear them talking about political problems, political affiliations?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; they discussed politics.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was De Mohrenschildt living in Dallas at the time of\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He lived in Haiti.\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. Do you know if he was in Haiti?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know whether he lived in Dallas at the time of\r\nthe assassination or whether he lived in Haiti.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Could you think back, Mrs. Oswald, is there any fact\r\nwhich comes to your mind which would lead you to believe that any\r\nperson or persons were associated with your husband in any plan to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy, or you thought, Governor Connally?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. Of course, I don't know anything about it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But my question was--not whether you knew. I asked you\r\nwhether you had any facts which would lead you to believe that there\r\nwas anyone?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I do not know about this.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. One other question. Did Lee Oswald ever say to you that\r\nhe had any kind of connection with the Cuban Government or any of its\r\nagents?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. He did not tell me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I said one more, and this is the last one, I promise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nOnce you said that when you went to New Orleans together, he said\r\nsomething like this: \"I'm lost.\" If that's correct, what was he talking\r\nabout? Do you remember that?* **\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. On that particular occasion he sat by the icebox or\r\nthe frigidaire and he sat there and he had his head in his hands and\r\nhe said, \"I am lost.\" I believe that that was the result of all the\r\nfailures of his.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you feel sympathy for him and love for him in those\r\ndays?*\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Yes; I felt sorry for him. I knew it was difficult for him\r\nwith his family. I felt sorry for him.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All right.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. When you testified the second time in Washington, Mrs.\r\nOswald, that you didn't think Mr. De Mohrenschildt was as dangerous as\r\nhe sounds--that was your personal opinion--what did you mean by that?*\r\n\r\nHere it is: \"Mr. Mohrenschildt once took us out to the Fords' house. It\r\nwas at New Year's, I think--Katya Ford's house. It was either Christmas\r\nor New Year's. I don't think Mr. De Mohrenschildt is as dangerous as he\r\nsounds. That's my personal opinion.\"\r\n\r\nNo one had said anything about him being dangerous, so why was that\r\nyour opinion?** *\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Off the record.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. She understood that.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. This goes into the record, of course?\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I think she's hesitated----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. I think she should explain it.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. George is such a big mouth.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Let's let her testify, if you don't mind?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I'm translating what she said.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Oh, is that what she said? I see. I'm sorry. I'm\r\nsorry--I didn't hear it.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. George is such a loud mouth or big talker----\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Big talker--that would be the equivalent, I'm sure.\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. I simply do not believe that--it is my intuition----\r\n\r\nMr. GOPADZE. No; that point?\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It is my opinion that people that talk too much do little.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. And did he talk too much or talk very loud? I don't\r\nknow Mr. De Mohrenschildt.** *\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Very loud.\r\n\r\n*He jokes all the time and people don't know when he talks sense and\r\nwhen he jokes.\r\n\r\n**Sometimes he would say something jokingly and people would think that\r\nhe's telling the truth.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Was that boasting about some imaginary achievement of\r\nhis?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. It's simply his manner of speaking--of talking. It's his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. He didn't talk then about his feats of any kind, about\r\nperforming any great feats?*\r\n\r\n*Mrs. OSWALD. No; he never did.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. It was merely his tone of voice and his manner of\r\nexpression that made him sound dangerous?**\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. He was boasting about it, but he never would follow\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You might tell the full story.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Quite often he would be boasting about something big but\r\nhe never did follow through.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. So he did talk about great achievements most of the\r\ntime?*\r\n\r\n**Mrs. OSWALD. Just like a fellow who is just a happy go-around man, a\r\nhappy go-lucky man.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. If there is nothing further, the Commission thanks you\r\nvery much for your assistance, and you, Mr. Gregory, and above all, the\r\nvery remarkable reporter who has been able to stay with us from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe Commission will now recess subject to the call of the Chairman or\r\nChief Justice Warren.\r\n\r\nMrs. OSWALD. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nSenator RUSSELL. Thank you.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 8 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nMisspellings in quoted evidence not changed; misspellings that could be\r\ndue to mispronunciations were not changed.\r\n\r\nSome simple typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.\r\n\r\nOccasional uses of \"Mr.\" for \"Mrs.\" and of \"Mrs.\" for \"Mr.\" corrected.\r\n\r\nDubious repeated words, (e.g., \"What took place by way of of\r\nconversation?\") retained.\r\n\r\nSeveral unbalanced quotation marks not remedied.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be question marks not changed.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be\r\nperiods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at\r\nthe end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at\r\nthe beginning of a line).
