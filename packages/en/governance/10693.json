II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A POLITICAL DIARY\r\n  1828-1830\r\n  BY EDWARD LAW\r\n  LORD ELLENBOROUGH\r\n\r\n  EDITED BY LORD COLCHESTER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: fide et fiducia]\r\n\r\n  IN TWO VOLUMES\r\n  VOL. II.\r\n\r\n  LONDON\r\n  RICHARD BENTLEY & SON, NEW BURLINGTON STREET\r\n  Publishers in Ordinary to Her Majesty the Queen\r\n  1881\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 1, 1829._\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington wrote to the King to ask if he had any objection to\r\nraising the galleries. He had none. So we sent for Sir T. Tyrwhit, and had\r\nhim at the Cabinet dinner to ask him whether he could fix the galleries by\r\nfour to-morrow. He said _No_. So we must do as we can.\r\n\r\nForty foreigners applied for seats to-day after four o'clock.\r\n\r\nIn the House I made the second reading of the Bills an order of the day at\r\nthe desire of Lord Malmesbury and Lord Grey. It is more formal so, but the\r\nsecond reading might have been equally well moved without it.\r\n\r\nLord Grey said a few words on presenting a petition expressing a hope to be\r\nconvinced on the subject of the Franchise Bill, but laying ground for\r\nvoting against it. Lord Malmesbury likewise expressed himself against it.\r\nWe shall be hard pushed on this Bill. The Duke says we have 122 sure votes\r\nand no more upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Chester read prayers, his wife having died about ten days\r\nago. Really some one of the other Bishops might have relieved him.\r\n\r\nLord Shaftesbury, in the absence of the Chancellor, sat as Speaker. I moved\r\nthe bills _pro formâ_ for him.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet dinner at Peel's, Peel said the Bishop of Oxford was ready\r\nto speak at any time, and wished to follow a violent bishop. He may easily\r\nfind one.\r\n\r\nWe had much talk about our approaching debates. Peel, after the Duke was\r\ngone, regretted his having taken the line of expressing his anxiety to\r\nrelieve himself from the obloquy cast upon him, and his having put that\r\ndesire forward as his reason for pressing the second reading of the Bill on\r\nThursday. The Duke having said so, we could not back him out. We might\r\navoid taking the same ground, but we could not alter it.\r\n\r\nAberdeen mentioned the case of the Candian blockade. I am sorry to see he\r\ndoes not communicate beforehand now with the Duke. He never looks forward\r\nto the ultimate consequences of his measures. Now he talks of convoying\r\nEnglish ships to Candia, and telling them they may go there safely, and if\r\nstopped shall be indemnified. But if the English ship finds a Russian off\r\nCandia, and is warned off, yet persists, under the expectation of\r\nindemnity, we should be obliged to pay the indemnity. The Russians, having\r\ngiven warning, would be justified in taking the vessel.\r\n\r\nSo if we give convoy, and the convoy ship persists, we should come to\r\nblows. All these things should be foreseen. Aberdeen thinks Lièven is\r\nignorant of Heyden's having had any orders. He excuses him as having acted\r\nin the spirit of the treaty, to _avoid the effusion_ of blood!\r\n\r\nOne thing is clear; we cannot permit Russia, as a belligerent, to defeat\r\nthe objects of the Treaty of London, and yet act with her under that\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 2._\r\n\r\nSecond reading Catholic Relief Bill. The Duke made a very bad speech. The\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury drivelled. The Primate of Ireland made a strong\r\nspeech, his manner admirable. Both these against. The Bishop of Oxford had\r\nplaced himself at our disposal to be used when wanted. We put him into the\r\ndebate here, wanting him very much. The first part of his speech was very\r\nindifferent, the latter excellent. Lord Lansdowne spoke better than he has\r\ndone for some time, indeed for two years. The Bishop of London against us;\r\nbut he made a speech more useful than ten votes, in admirable taste,\r\nlooking to the measure as one to be certainly accomplished, &c. The Duke of\r\nRichmond spoke very shortly, but better than he has ever done, in reply. We\r\nadjourned at 1.\r\n\r\n229 members in the House. Room for thirty more; the House not oppressively\r\nhot; numbers of women. The tone of the debate temperate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 3._\r\n\r\nA speech from the Bishop of Durham, full of fallacies and extravagant, but\r\nhaving its effect.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor spoke admirably, endeavouring to bring up Eldon, but the old\r\nman would not move. He wanted more time to consider his answer, by which he\r\nwill not improve it.\r\n\r\nA speech from Goderich, very animated in his way, and very heavy. The House\r\ndid not cheer him once. He pressed himself upon it with bad taste. He spoke\r\nupon all the collateral and unimportant points. He swung his arm about like\r\na boy throwing a stone from a sling.\r\n\r\nLord Mansfield spoke, sleepily and ill-naturedly. I was exhausted, and\r\ncould not have answered him, had he said anything worth answering.\r\n\r\nWe adjourned at two till one to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 4._\r\n\r\nHouse at 1. A long absurd speech from Lord Guildford, which must have given\r\nmuch pain to Lady Ch. Lindsay, who sat under the throne, and who must have\r\nbeen much annoyed at seeing to what her family had fallen. We had then Lord\r\nLilford, who rested too much on his notes, but who has a good manner. He\r\ndrew his points well, and spoke like a man, not like a boy.\r\n\r\nLord Tenterden was not powerful. Lord Grey spoke better than he has done\r\nsince 1827. He made a speech too long, and indeed the last half-hour was of\r\nno use. He beat the brains out of the Coronation Oath, as an obstacle to\r\nCatholic Concession, and read a curious letter of Lord Yestor to Lord\r\nTweddale, dated April, 1689, before William III. took the Coronation Oath,\r\nin which Lord Tester mentions that it was understood that the king had in\r\ncouncil declared his understanding of the sense of the Coronation Oath--\r\nthat it bound him in his executive capacity, not in his legislative. Lord\r\nWestmoreland made an odd, entertaining from its manner, and really very\r\ngood speech. He supported the Bill.\r\n\r\nLord Eldon, who, after an ineffectual attempt on the part of Lord Redesdale\r\nto speak, followed Lord Grey, made a very weak, inefficient, powerless\r\nspeech. He seemed beaten, and in some respects his memory had failed him.\r\n\r\nLord Plunket drew, with great power, a picture of the state of society in\r\nIreland as affected by the laws. The whole of his speech was powerful.\r\n\r\nHis speech and Lord Grey's were excellent.\r\n\r\nAfter a few sentences from Lord Farnham we divided.\r\n\r\n  Present for                    149\r\n  Against                         79\r\n                                ----\r\n                  Majority        68\r\n  Proxies for                     70\r\n  Against                         33\r\n                                ----\r\n  Total Content                  217\r\n  Not Content                    112\r\n                                ----\r\n                  Majority       105\r\n\r\nThis will quiet Windsor. The King was to have received a number of\r\npetitions to be presented by peers to-day. The Primate of Ireland was to\r\nhave gone, and the Irish Bishops. The latter went. If they had not gone,\r\nthe King would have made some excuse for not receiving them.\r\n\r\nThe majority must put an end to all agitation in England, and tranquillise\r\nIreland. Indeed as regards this question Ireland is tranquil. The conduct\r\nof the Catholics has been as excellent as that of the Protestants. Hitherto\r\nthe announcement of the measure has produced effects beyond what was\r\nanticipated from its adoption.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Rutland, who was not expected, and indeed every doubtful vote\r\nwas with us.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants are subdued.\r\n\r\nLord Grey's speech, but still more Lord Plunket's, will have a greater\r\neffect upon the public mind, than any which have yet been delivered.\r\n\r\nReally it seems like a dream! That I should, if I lived, live to see this I\r\ndid expect; but that I should see it so soon, and that I should happen to\r\nbe a member of the Government that carried it, I did not expect. I must say\r\nwith what delight I view the prospect of having Catholics in Parliament. I\r\nam sure it will do more for the happiness of Ireland, and for the strength\r\nof the Empire, than any measure that could have been adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 5. _\r\n\r\nDined with Lady Sandwich and met the Arbuthnots, with whom I had a long\r\ntalk. She told me the Duke wanted to bring in Lord Chandos, by way of\r\nconciliating the Tories. She thought Lord Rosslyn ought to have the Privy\r\nSeal, and that, considering their late conduct, the Whigs should be\r\npreferred to the Tories, whom we should have at any rate. That it was\r\nenough not to punish them by depriving them of their offices.\r\n\r\nIn all this I agree. I think if the Duke should go to the Tories and turn\r\nhis back upon the Whigs after what has taken place, he will make Opposition\r\nvery acrimonious, and our debates very disagreeable.\r\n\r\nI told her if the Privy Seal was to be a Tory, I thought the Duke of\r\nRichmond the best. He is the most popular man in the House of Lords, and a\r\ngood debater. The Duke and Lord Bathurst say he is cunning; but as far as I\r\ncan judge he acts fairly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 6._\r\n\r\nHouse. Second reading Franchise Bill. Opposed by the Duke of Richmond, Lord\r\nMalmesbury, Winchelsea, and Clanricarde. Lord Holland spoke in favour of\r\nthe Bill as connected with the Relief Bill. The Whigs voted with us. Dudley\r\nspoke in favour, just to separate himself from the Canningites, for whom\r\nHaddington spoke, more reluctant than the Whigs.\r\n\r\nLord Winchelsea was very mad, wished to expel the bishops, to prevent\r\ntranslations, equalise their sees, &c. We had 139 to 19. The minority\r\nwere--Dukes: Cumberland, Gloucester, Brandon, Richmond, Newcastle;\r\nMarquises--Salisbury, Clanrickarde; Earls--Winchelsea Malmesbury, O'Neil;\r\nLords--Falmouth, Penrhyn, Boston, Grantley, Glenlyon; Earl Digby, Earl\r\nRomney.\r\n\r\nThe Duke goes to Windsor on Saturday to get the King to consent to give the\r\nRoyal assent on Thursday, the day before Good Friday. The Duke of\r\nCumberland has been mischievous at Windsor. The King fancies he is in the\r\nsituation of Louis XVI. That he shall run down by Liberalism. The Duke of\r\nCumberland swears he will turn us out, let who will be Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 7._\r\n\r\nLord Eldon and others opened afresh the question as to the principle of the\r\nBill on the first clause. We divided with more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops and Lord Eldon got into a theological discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor made a strong attack upon Lord Eldon, who really spoke very\r\nchildishly.\r\n\r\nWe had as many women as ever, but a new set, and some of the prettiest\r\ngirls in London--Miss Bagot, Miss Sheridan, and others.\r\n\r\nAt Windsor, last Sunday, the Duke of Cumberland spoke very warmly indeed to\r\nAberdeen about the Duke of Wellington. He said he had sat by us as our\r\nfriend, till the King's Ministers joined in the _hoot_ against him. (This\r\nwas particularly Lord Bathurst, who shook his head at him and cheered\r\noffensively.) He seems in speaking of the Duke of Wellington to have used\r\nterms hardly to be expected.\r\n\r\nHe told the Chancellor to-day that he should, before the Bill passed,\r\ndeclare he never could again feel confidence in His Majesty's Ministers;\r\nthat the country was ruined; and that he should leave it and never return.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor told him he advised him not to make the last promise. I hope\r\nhe will make it and keep it.\r\n\r\nI observed him afterwards address the Chancellor very warmly, after he had\r\nattacked Eldon.\r\n\r\nA man of the name of Halcomb has advertised for a meeting on Friday, on the\r\nroad to Windsor, to carry petitions to the King.\r\n\r\nApril 8.\r\n\r\nCommittee on Relief Bill. No division. Several amendments. Those of Lord\r\nTenterden very silly.\r\n\r\nI said a very few words twice.\r\n\r\nThe third reading is fixed for Friday. When the Duke of Cumberland heard\r\nthe third reading fixed he left the House like a disappointed fiend. He did\r\nnot take his hat off till he had got half-way down.\r\n\r\nLord Eldon seems quite beaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 9._\r\n\r\nLord Eldon went to Windsor to-day with petitions. Yesterday Lord Howe and\r\nthree others went. I believe these peers have been: Duke of Newcastle,\r\nKenyon, Rolle, Howe, O'Neil, Bexley, Winchelsea, Farnham, and six bishops.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. A meeting is advertised for to-morrow, to take place at\r\nApsley House. Then to proceed to Slough or Salt Hill, or to Eton, to\r\ndeliver there a petition to the Duke of Cumberland, who is then to present\r\nit to the King, and the people are to wait for an answer.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has written to the King, acquainting him with the plan, and\r\nadvising His Majesty to refuse to receive the petition except through the\r\nhands of Mr. Peel.\r\n\r\nPeel is going down to Windsor himself. The Duke writes to-night to tell the\r\nKing he is going, and to repeat his advice of this morning as coming from\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIf the King will not take Peel's advice we go out.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks the King will yield, and that the meeting will be a\r\nfailure. So have I thought from the first. There is no agitation in London.\r\nNo feeling, no excitement. The King will know Peel is coming in time to be\r\nable to inform the Duke of Cumberland, and prevent his setting out.\r\n\r\nIn the House about nine the Duke received a letter from Sir W. Knighton,\r\ninforming him that he had _no doubt_ the King would take his advice\r\nrespecting the petitions. Eldon was there, and probably saw the letter.\r\n\r\nHouse. Got through the report of the Franchise Bill. Third reading fixed\r\nfor to-morrow. I had to say a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 11, 1829._\r\n\r\nHouse. A long speech from Lord Eldon, containing no argument, and both flat\r\nand bad.\r\n\r\nThen a speech from Lord Harrowby, long and sensible; but heavily delivered\r\nand not wanted. A long speech from Lord Lansdowne, still less wanted, and\r\nvery dull.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was obliged to say something civil to the Whigs, but he did it\r\nsparingly, and _contre coeur_.\r\n\r\nWe had a majority of 104. The Franchise Bill was likewise read a third\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe mutual congratulations were cordial. The House is in good humour again.\r\nAll are glad to get rid of the question. The Duke of Cumberland, Falmouth,\r\nand Winchelsea, perhaps Kenyon, are lost to the Government, but no others.\r\n\r\nLord Middleton voted with us, having been against on the second reading.\r\nThe Duke of Rutland against, having been with us before.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Clarence was absent, being ill. He had fourteen leeches on his\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\nThe House was full of ladies. Mrs. Fox, Lady Jersey, Lady Pitt and her\r\ndaughters, Lady A. Brudenell, Lady Harrowby, Lady G. Wortley, Lord Eldon's\r\ndaughters, Lady Glengall, Mrs. and Miss Sheridan, the old Duchess of\r\nRichmond, Lady Manners, Lady Rolle, Lady Haddington, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe intended row failed altogether. Only four carriages went down to\r\nWindsor. Halcomb and his two friends saw an equerry. They were told their\r\npetition must be presented through the Secretary of State, and went away\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland said he must withdraw his support from the\r\nGovernment; but he was temperate. In fact he was beaten.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk was in the House, as happy as man could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 11._\r\n\r\nDr. Clarke and H. Fane both spoke of the Chancellor's speech in attack upon\r\nEldon, as in bad taste and offensive. I shall endeavour to ascertain\r\nwhether this is the general opinion. Not having heard Eldon, they cannot\r\nknow how very mischievous and disingenuous he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 12._\r\n\r\nMet the Lievens, Lyndhursts, Sir J. Murray, and others at dinner, at the\r\nEsterhazy's. The King has not yet sent back the commission to pass the\r\nCatholic Bill.\r\n\r\nThe Lievens are more shy of me than ever.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst seemed to be much pleased with my idea of carrying on the\r\nGovernment of India in the King's name. He said it should be under a\r\nSecretary of State for India.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor approved highly of my notion of suggesting Herries for the\r\nGovernment of Bombay, if the directors will not have Courtney. He is\r\nuseless to us, and a discredit. Besides, we want his place.\r\n\r\nHad some talk with Vernon at Lady Jersey's. He has the Canning venom about\r\nhim still, and said we should still regret having lost Huskisson, &c.\r\n\r\nI said NEVER. He was an able man, but he would never do as a member of a\r\nCabinet in which he was not chief. The Government would not have lived if\r\nhe had continued in. I told him I had become satisfied from my short\r\nexperience that a coalition Government could not conduct the affairs of the\r\ncountry with advantage--especially where the difference was [blank].\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland is gone to Windsor. If the commission should not\r\narrive to-night I dare say the Duke of Wellington will go to Windsor early\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nLady Jersey was very loud in her dispraise of the Duke of Richmond. Every\r\none who knows him says he is very cunning. There is a mixture of good and\r\nbad taste about him. He is popular, and he would make a good man of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 13, 1829, Monday._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. Informed them of Sir Sidney Beckwith's appointment to the\r\ncommand at Bombay.\r\n\r\nTold them my general idea was that it was necessary to fix a Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor at Agra. I showed them it could be done without expense. Sir\r\nCharles Metcalfe should be the person appointed, with precise instructions\r\nobliging him to a system of non-interference in the internal concerns of\r\nthe Malwa and Rajpoot States. Sir J. Malcolm would have interposed.\r\n\r\nThe treaties with the Rajpoot States generally secure their internal\r\nindependence. Those with the States of Malwa give us the right, and impose\r\nupon us the duty of supervision. It requires, therefore, a most delicate\r\nhand to bring the whole into one system animated by one spirit.\r\n\r\nI said incidentally to-day, 'I will not sit here to sacrifice India to\r\nEngland,' a sentiment which escaped me, but which I feel to be correct, not\r\nonly socially but politically.\r\n\r\nAshley came and bored me about a petition of some Hindoos and Mahometans in\r\nCalcutta, who wish to be grand jurors. I told him I could not proceed\r\nhastily in any matter of legislation, and that this was one of much\r\ndelicacy. I should speak to Fergusson.\r\n\r\nA Cabinet had been fixed for 3. I concluded it was on account of a delay on\r\nthe King's part in giving the Royal assent to the Relief Bill. The Cabinet\r\nwas counter-ordered, the Commission having arrived at two.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor had sent a note to the King with the Bills, calling his\r\nattention to them. The King, on sending them back with the Commission\r\nsigned, thanked the Chancellor for having called his attention to the\r\nBills, and said he gave his assent reluctantly.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor had sent a note last night to Watson, the Equerry, desiring\r\nhim to remind the King of the Commission.\r\n\r\nSo at a few minutes before four to-day the Chancellor, Lord Bathurst, and I\r\nsat as Commissioners to give the Royal assent to the Relief Bill, and about\r\nthirty-nine others. So many had been kept back to force an early decision.\r\nThe Indemnity Bill was one of the Bills, and the Militia Lists Bill\r\nanother. There were thirteen peers in the House, and seven or eight more\r\nabout. Lord Savoy, his son, young Lambton, Lady Petres, and her daughters,\r\nMrs. Fox, and some other ladies were there--Lady Stanhope. The old Duchess\r\nof Richmond came too late.\r\n\r\nI observed that in passing each other very close the Duke of Wellington and\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland took no notice of each other.\r\n\r\nLord Durham said to me, 'Now the King will turn you all out in revenge as\r\nsoon as he can,' to which I assented. He certainly will when he dares.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk and Mr. Petres were in the House, giving and receiving\r\ncongratulations. All parties congratulate the Duke. Falmouth alone still\r\nlooks sad and sombre. The Duke of Wellington has a bad cold. He was very\r\nhoarse, and wrapped himself in his cloak as soon as he had done speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 14._\r\n\r\nSaw Mr. Fergusson respecting a petition from Hindoos and Mahometans at\r\nCalcutta, praying to be allowed to sit on grand juries. He thinks they\r\nshould--as they are allowed to sit on petty juries. If the matter had been\r\nwell considered, the privilege they now ask should have been granted before\r\nthat they have obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. Fergusson is, however, rather afraid of allowing them to sit on the\r\ntrial of Christians.\r\n\r\nBy the newspapers I see that there has been a quarrel at Teheran, between\r\nsome of the Russian Ambassador's suite and the populace, which led to an\r\nattack upon the Russian palace, and to the death of the Ambassador and all\r\nhis people except two. This is an unfortunate event, as it will give the\r\nRussians a new claim to indemnity, which they will exercise inexorably.\r\nProbably they will insist on the junction of Persia in the attack on\r\nTurkey, as the only satisfaction they can accept.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that the example once given, and the people despairing\r\nof pardon, a rising against the Russians may take place, and something of a\r\nnational feeling arise in Persia. But I fear this will not be the case. I\r\nsuppose our Minister was at Tabriz.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 15._\r\n\r\nThe Duke was at Windsor to-day to ask the King's permission to restore the\r\nresigners. The King said he thought the Duke could not do better. He just\r\nmentioned Wetherell's name as if he thought he was to be excepted from the\r\nrestoration, but desired to be _certior-factus_.\r\n\r\nThe King was cold. The Duke had to wait twenty minutes, the Duke of\r\nCumberland being with the King. However, I believe this delay may only have\r\noriginated in a necessary change of dress on His Majesty's part, as he was\r\nsitting for his picture _in a Highland dress_. The Duke saw a large plaid\r\nbonnet in the room, and he believes the King had still on plaid stockings.\r\nThe business of the restoration was finished in ten minutes, when the\r\nconversation flagged, and the Duke was rising to go away.\r\n\r\nHowever, something more was then said, and the interview in all lasted\r\ntwenty minutes. The King said he was delighted with Lord Winchelsea. He was\r\nso gentlemanlike, and spoke _in so low a tone of voice!_ He likewise\r\nthought Lord Farnham very gentlemanlike, and Lord Rolle more violent than\r\nany.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had to wait twenty minutes before he could see Lady Conyngham.\r\nThey seemed to wish him not to see her. However, he did. She said all would\r\nhave been quiet if the Duke of Cumberland had not come over, and all would\r\nbe quiet when he went away. The King seemed relieved since the Bill was\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nOn his return the Duke sent for George Bankes and offered him his place\r\nagain. Bankes asked two or three days to consider. The Duke gave him till\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt seems he has now a notion that he owed his place not to the Duke but to\r\nsome other influence. I think this has been insinuated to him since his\r\nresignation. The fact is otherwise. The King had mentioned Bankes for other\r\nsituations, but not for the one he holds. On my return home I found Bankes\r\nhad called upon me.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we considered whether the prosecution of Lawless for his\r\nconduct at Ballybeg should be persevered in.\r\n\r\nGoulbourn, Peel, Lord Bathurst, Sir G. Murray, and I were for dropping it.\r\nI think the Chancellor inclined the same way. The Duke and the rest,\r\nAberdeen being absent, were for going on.\r\n\r\nI thought no benefit would be derived from success. Even success would\r\nrevive feelings and recollections which are dying away, and which we wish\r\nto be forgotten. If we decline proceeding we can say we did so from the\r\nfear of exciting dormant passions. If we proceed, we shall have no excuse\r\nshould we revive the memory of bad times.\r\n\r\nReference is to be made to Ireland to ascertain the feeling about it there.\r\n\r\nBankes came at twelve o'clock. He told me he had been with the Duke, and\r\nhad received from him the offer of his old office. He had asked permission\r\nto consult one person, whose name he did not mention to the Duke,--it was\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland. He had called at the Palace and found the Duke of\r\nCumberland was at Windsor. He wanted to write to him to ask if he had any\r\nobjection to his taking the office again.\r\n\r\nBankes said he had attended none of the meetings at Lord Chandos's. He had\r\navoided as much as he could all communication with the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nHe had fully determined not to take a part with any new Government which\r\nmight be formed, unless it should clearly appear the King had been unfairly\r\ndealt by, or unless there should be an attempt to make peers to carry the\r\nBill. The Duke of Cumberland had always said that he made him his first\r\nobject, and he had reason to think that he had mentioned him to the King,\r\nand had been instrumental in his appointment. The Duke of Cumberland had\r\ndesired him to come to him (during the Bill), and had apparently intended\r\nto name some particular office for him, but seeing his coldness had only\r\nsounded him, and had received the answer I have mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland had told him it was an understood thing that all\r\nwere to be restored, and that he saw no reason why he should not take his\r\noffice again.\r\n\r\n_This was ten days ago._\r\n\r\nI told him I advised, if he thought it necessary to write to the Duke of\r\nCumberland at all, that he should merely state his intention to take his\r\noffice back again, refer to his conversation with the Duke himself upon the\r\npoint, and add _distinctly_ that, taking office, he could no longer have\r\nany communication on political matters with a person who had declared his\r\nhostility to the Government.\r\n\r\nI advised him to send off his own servant on a post-horse at six o'clock\r\nto-morrow morning, with a letter to the effect I have stated to the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and whether he received an answer or not, to go to the Duke of\r\nWellington and accept at 12.\r\n\r\nI advised him to tell the Duke the whole state of the case, and all he had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington did not seem by any means well to-day. He was\r\nblooded yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 16._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. It seems Bankes called on the Duke this morning, but he was\r\nengaged. I told him all that passed between Bankes and me last night. If\r\nBankes should go out the Duke means to offer his place to Sir J. Graham.\r\n\r\nWe met upon foreign affairs. Aberdeen read his instructions to Gordon, who\r\ngoes to Constantinople. They are unobjectionable.\r\n\r\nWe then considered what was to be done in consequence of this second\r\nviolation of their word on the part of the Russians in blockading Candia.\r\n\r\nCount Heyden has written two letters to Sir Pulteney Malcolm. In the first\r\nhe justifies the blockade of Candia on the ground of its being necessary to\r\nprotect the Morea from the Pacha of Egypt; in the second he rests it on the\r\nnecessity of blockading the two extremities of Candia for the purpose of\r\nwatching Constantinople.\r\n\r\nWe cannot permit the Russians to make fools of us in this way--to promise\r\none thing as parties to the Treaty of London, and to do another as\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cabinet I asked the Duke whether he still wished me to press\r\nCourtney upon the Directors. He said, Yes, he very much wanted his place. I\r\nsaid it had occurred to me that _Herries_ might take the Governorship of\r\nBombay. It did not seem to have occurred to him. He said he thought Herries\r\nwould not go; but he evidently thought it would be a very good thing if he\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said he wanted to have the places of Courtney and Sir G. Hill, and\r\nto bring in Lord Chandos and M. Fitzgerald. We mentioned Ashley. I\r\nsuggested Ashley's going to the Treasury, and Sir J. Graham taking his\r\nplace. This would, I dare say, be done, if we could get the place at the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet heard a surmise as to the new Lord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nLord O'Neil has signed the Duke of Richmond's protest against the Franchise\r\nBill. It is very hostile to the Government, and Lord O'Neil will probably\r\nbe put out.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond has been very imprudent. Had he taken a moderate line\r\nhe probably might have been Privy Seal. His time is now gone by.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 17._\r\n\r\nWent by appointment to see Lady Jersey. Found there Duncannon and Lord\r\nSefton. Duncannon talked big about O'Connell's power, and in the same sense\r\nin which he talked to Fitzgerald, wishing to induce the Government to let\r\nhim take his seat. I said we could not. It depended not on us, but upon the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nLady Sefton came in afterwards for a few minutes, and Lord Rosslyn. Lady\r\nJersey talked a great deal about the restoration, and feared the Whigs\r\nwould imagine they were never to come in, and would form a violent\r\nopposition. She mentioned Mr. Stanley as being much annoyed, he having made\r\na laudatory speech in favour of Peel.\r\n\r\nI told her it would have been very harsh to have eliminated those who had\r\ntaken office under the idea that the Government was rather against than for\r\nthe Catholics, certainly _neutral_, and that it was a little unreasonable\r\nto expect others to be turned out to make way for new friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 18._\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks he could not offer the Privy Seal to Lord Grey, but he\r\nwould be conciliated by having a friend--that is, Rosslyn--in. If we could\r\nget Lord Beresford out, Lord Rosslyn would go to the Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe Duke says the King would make it a point of honour to resist the\r\nintroduction of Lord Grey, though in reality he was in communication with\r\nLord Grey in 1820-21, after the Queen's trial, and then intended to bring\r\nhim in and to turn out the then Ministers for the Milan Commission, he\r\nhaving been himself at the bottom of that Commission. The Duke, the only\r\nmember of the Cabinet who was not mixed up with the Milan Commission,\r\ninduced the King to give up his idea of making a change.\r\n\r\nBankes received a letter from the Duke of Cumberland, very long, and\r\nagainst his acceptance of office; but he begged Bankes to go down to see\r\nhim and talk it over. He did so. Bankes told him he would not accept if he\r\non consideration objected, but he was determined not to join any other\r\nGovernment. The Duke of Cumberland spoke of himself as having been ill-used\r\nby the Duke of Wellington. This was explained. The conference ended by the\r\nDuke of Cumberland's acquiescing entirely in Bankes's acceptance of office.\r\nBankes saw the Duke of Wellington and detailed the whole to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 21._\r\n\r\nCalled on Sir H. Hardinge at Richmond. He told me the Duke had at first\r\ngreat reluctance to have anything to do with the Whigs. By his account he\r\nmust have principally contributed to lead the Duke to adopt that view which\r\nhe has now of admitting Rosslyn, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 22._\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk called, and, not finding me, left a note begging me to\r\nascertain privately from the Duke of Wellington whether the King would be\r\npleased if the English Catholics presented an address to him thanking him\r\nfor the Relief Bill.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from the Duke of Wellington expressing a decided opinion\r\nagainst any address from the Roman Catholics. He says, 'Everything has been\r\ndone that is possible to efface all distinctions between the King's\r\nsubjects on the score of religion, and this with a view to the general\r\nbenefit, and not to that of a particular body. I confess I shall think that\r\nthis measure has failed in attaining its object if there should be any\r\ngeneral act of a particular body.\r\n\r\n'In respect to the King himself I am certain that the most agreeable thing\r\nto him would be that all should remain quiet.\r\n\r\n'We must have no distinct body of Roman Catholics except in the churches\r\nand in affairs of religion. The less we act inconsistently with the\r\nprinciple the better.'\r\n\r\nI so entirely agree in opinion with the Duke of Wellington that, having for\r\nmy own amusement written an address for the Roman Catholics in the event of\r\ntheir making any to the King, the first sentence I imagined was this: 'The\r\nRoman Catholics of England approach your Majesty for the last time as a\r\nbody distinct from the rest of your Majesty's subjects.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 25._\r\n\r\nI had a good deal of conversation as to the next Director. There are three\r\ncity men candidates, but none are good--Lyall, Ellice, and Douglas.\r\n\r\nOf Ellice no one knows anything. He is brother to the Ellice who married\r\nLord Grey's sister. Lyall is, or was, Chairman of the Committee of\r\nShipowners. Douglas is brother to Lord Queensbury. They say his is not a\r\nvery good house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 28._\r\n\r\nRead the correspondence between the Duke and Lord Anglesey. Then read a\r\nmemorandum of the Duke's in reply to one of Hardinge's on the subject of\r\nthe discipline of the British army. Hardinge wished to introduce the\r\nPrussian [Footnote: Which did not include capital punishment. See\r\n_Wellington Correspondence_, vol. v. p. 932.] discipline into ours. The\r\nDuke shows that with our discipline we have more men fit for duty in\r\nproportion to our numbers than the Prussians in the proportion of two to\r\none. That in Prussia the army is everything. There is no other profession.\r\nAll are soldiers--the officer lives much with his men--they are always in\r\nmasses, always in fertile countries.\r\n\r\nIn our service the worst men in the community enter the army. The officers\r\nare gentlemen. They cannot mix with the men. Without discipline our army\r\nwould be inferior to others. It is not even now the favourite profession.\r\nThere is much jealousy of it. It is not popular with the common people. It\r\nis difficult to find recruits even in times of distress.\r\n\r\nI was in an army, the Duke concludes, which cannot be governed on the\r\nPrussian principle. You cannot treat the English soldier as a man of\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had been with the King, who was in very good humour. He had not,\r\nhowever, got to close quarters with him as to the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 29._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 12. A letter has been received from Lord Heytesbury, from which\r\nit is clear that Russia will very soon resume altogether the exercise of\r\nher belligerent rights in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nNesselrode communicated to him the blockade of Candia. Lord Heytesbury only\r\nobserved that 'it was a resumption of belligerent rights.' This Count\r\nNesselrode did not deny, and he said they could not long remain in the\r\nfalse position in which they now were in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nCount Heyden at the end of January blockaded Candia on pretexts arising out\r\nof the state of Greece. In three weeks from that time he rested his\r\ninterception of the Egyptian vessels near Candia on the necessary exercise\r\nof his rights as a belligerent. Lièven, when first spoken to, disavowed\r\nHeyden. He now changes his tone, and it is evident that Russia now for the\r\nsecond time breaks her word. The French do not behave much better. They\r\nhave 6,000 men in the Morea, and mean to keep them there notwithstanding\r\ntheir engagement to withdraw their troops as soon as the Egyptians were\r\nembarked. To be sure, they say if we insist upon it they will withdraw\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI have always been for getting out of the treaty. We have been dragged\r\nalong very unwillingly--we have been subjected to much humiliation. We seem\r\nto me to have gained nothing by all our compliances. We have been led on\r\nfrom the violation of one principle to that of another. Our position has\r\ndiscouraged Turkey. We have been made the tools of Russia, and have been\r\nduped with our eyes open. I think the sooner we get out of this false\r\nposition the better, and there is no time so favourable for us to hold\r\nstrong language as this, when by the settlement of the Catholic question we\r\nare really strengthened, and when all foreign Powers believe we are yet\r\nmore strengthened than we are. The Duke is certainly for getting out. He\r\nhas long wished it.\r\n\r\nA paper of Peel's was read suggesting the difficulties in which we should\r\nstill be placed by our moral obligation towards the Greeks, and by our\r\nreasonable fear that on the principles of the Greek Treaty, to which we\r\nhave unfortunately given our adhesion, Russia and France may combine and\r\nmake a partition treaty. My expectation is that Russia and France would\r\nsoon quarrel, and I think I could before now have made them jealous of each\r\nother, but we have done nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter much conversation, V. Fitzgerald agreeing with me and the others\r\nsaying nothing, it was determined to insist upon the freedom of\r\ncommunication with Candia under the protocol, to insist upon the Greeks\r\nwithdrawing from their advanced position near Prevesa _under the protocol_,\r\nand to insist likewise upon the withdrawing of the French troops from the\r\nMorea, according to the engagement.\r\n\r\nI am not satisfied with this. Every part of our diplomacy has been\r\nunfortunate. We have succeeded in nothing. I predicted if we became engaged\r\nin the war, it would be ultimately on a little point and not upon a great\r\none. Our diplomacy cannot be defended. It is our weak point.\r\n\r\nHouse. All the Catholics there. Every good old name in England.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk is much pleased with the Duke of Wellington's answer to\r\nhis enquiry as to the propriety of addressing the King. I am going to send\r\nhim the Duke's original letter as a _record_.\r\n\r\nThe King certainly received the Protestant peers, and particularly those\r\nwho had been at Windsor, with great favour, and so the Bishop of Durham.\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland stood at the King's left hand, and quizzed the\r\npeople as they passed. He seemed _rayonnant_.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I had some conversation with Loch, the Chairman, as to\r\ngoverning India in the King's name. He does not positively object. I think\r\nI shall be able to carry that point. I consider it to be of the most\r\nessential importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 30._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 12. Determined to fund eight millions of Exchequer Bills. No\r\ntaxes to be taken off or imposed. We had some conversation as to the East\r\nRetford question. V. Fitzgerald communicated a proposal from Littleton to\r\npropose the adjournment of all discussion upon the subject till next year,\r\nas it is evident nothing can be done this year. Littleton proposed this\r\nbecause he wished to disappoint the mischievous designs of some people.\r\n(Palmerston particularly.)\r\n\r\nIt was determined to adhere to the line taken by the Government last year--\r\nnamely, to that of throwing East Retford into the hundred. The Duke was\r\ndecidedly of opinion that whatever we did we should do from ourselves, and\r\ncertainly not act in concert with an enemy. The Tories look to our conduct\r\nupon this question as the touchstone.\r\n\r\nDrawing-room. The King, as yesterday, very civil to the Brunswickers and\r\ntaking no notice of our friends. He took particular notice of the\r\nBrazilians. Madame de Lièven is endeavouring to form a Government with the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, the Ultra-Tories, the Canningites, and some Whigs.\r\n\r\nThe King is very Russian. I believe all this will end in nothing. The\r\nChancellor thinks they may try to make a change when Parliament is up, and\r\nso have six months before them. They may think of it; but the only object\r\nof such a Government would be _revenge._ They cannot repeal the Relief\r\nBill, nor do they wish to pursue a different line of policy either at home\r\nor abroad.\r\n\r\nThe foreigners think that having settled the Catholic question we are ready\r\nto draw the sword, and find a field of battle wherever we can. This the\r\nRussians are afraid of, and hence arises in some degree their wish to\r\noverthrow the Duke's Government; but the real foundation of all the Russian\r\nintrigues is Madame de Lièven's hatred for the Duke, and her rage at\r\nfeeling she has overreached herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 1._\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Tyrwhitt was with the King for two hours to-day, the Duke of\r\nCumberland being in the room and the King in bed. The King is very much out\r\nof humour, and abused everything and everybody. He is very angry at ladies\r\nbeing admitted to the House of Lords, and particularly at their going in\r\nsuch numbers the day the Duke of Norfolk took his seat. The Duke of\r\nCumberland has sworn he will not leave England till he has turned out the\r\npresent Ministers. He is the only colonel of the Horse Guards who ever does\r\nduty--Lord Cathcart being absent and Lord Harrington incapable. When he\r\nlast got the gold stick from Lord Harrington he swore he would never let it\r\nout of his hands. As gold stick he ordered the gates of the Horse Guards to\r\nbe closed the day of the Drawing-room, and thus obliged all the Ministers\r\nwho dressed in Downing Street to go all round.\r\n\r\nHe told Clanwilliam to-day with great satisfaction that the King never\r\ncould again be on good terms with his Ministers.\r\n\r\nNo arrangement is yet made with the Master of the Rolls. Everything waits\r\nfor the legal promotions. The King will be delighted with Scarlett\r\n[Footnote: Sir James Scarlett, afterwards Lord Abinger.] as Attorney-\r\nGeneral, and the Chancellor tells me Bickersteth is to be Solicitor. I\r\nrecollect hearing of him at Cambridge. He is a very clever man and a good\r\nspeaker. Tindal is of course to be Master of the Rolls. I am most anxious\r\nto give up the Privy Seal to Rosslyn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 3._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. Decided the Government was to take the same line exactly this\r\nyear as to East Retford (that is, as to giving the two members to the\r\nHundred) that it took last year. However, as it is impossible to get any\r\nBill through the Lords this year, Peel will be very willing to accede to\r\nany proposition for postponing the whole question till next session.\r\n\r\nOn the question of Irish Education and on that of the grant to Maynooth,\r\nthe vote will be as before--it being said that the state of the session and\r\nthe circumstances of the present period make it advisable that the question\r\nof any change should be deferred. Indeed, Ministers have not had time to\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\nMany of Lord Anglesey's letters to Peel and of Peel's answers were read. We\r\nhave a very strong case against him on his letter to Dr. Curtis, which by a\r\nletter from Dr. Curtis to the Duke we know Lord Anglesey directed Dr.\r\nMurray to publish if it could be done with Curtis's consent, and which Dr.\r\nMurray did publish without obtaining such consent.\r\n\r\nCurtis's letter is dated January 2.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey wrote to Curtis for the Duke's letter and his answer, and had\r\nthem two days before December 23, the date of his letter to Curtis.\r\n\r\nPeel thinks the East Indian Committee should not be refused. It is better\r\nfor the East Indian Company that it should be granted than refused. I\r\nentirely coincide with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 4._\r\n\r\nCoal Committee at 12. Met Lord Bathhurst, with whom I had some conversation\r\nas to the Duke's reading letters in answer to Lord Anglesey. He begged me\r\nto go to the Duke, and try to induce him not to do so. I found the Duke\r\nagreeing with me entirely as to the danger of the president, and disposed\r\nto read only what might be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey brought forward his motion for 'the letter of recall.'\r\n\r\nThe Duke answered him, and so well that even Lord Holland could not say one\r\nword. So the thing ended.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had been assured by the King, and within the last fortnight the\r\nKing had given the same assurance to Aberdeen, that Lord Anglesey had not\r\n_permission_ to read confidential letters.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey stated that he had the King's permission.\r\n\r\nThe Duke certainly seemed to contradict him.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry threw a note over to me suggesting that the contradiction\r\nwas so direct there might be an awkward explanation out of doors unless the\r\nthing were softened down.\r\n\r\nI mentioned this to Lord Bathurst. He thought not.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he replied, Lord Anglesey treated the contradiction as\r\nabsolute, and Lord Bathurst told the Duke he must give some explanation,\r\nwhich the Duke did, saying he did not mean to accuse Lord Anglesey of\r\ndeclaring he had the King's permission when he had not, but only that he\r\nhad reason to think he had not. In fact, the King, as we always thought,\r\ntold the Duke one thing and Lord Anglesey another; and the only result of\r\nthe debate is that the King is proved to have told a lie.\r\n\r\nLord Wharncliffe, who overtook me as I was riding home, considered Lord\r\nAnglesey to be blown out of water.\r\n\r\nAt Lady Brownlow's ball I talked with Lord Farnborough, Longford, and\r\nBeresford. All thought the reading of the letters should have been stopped,\r\nand that the Duke did wrong to read anything. We could not stop the reading\r\nof the letters when the King's permission to read them was stated\r\ndistinctly by Lord Anglesey. The misery is that we have a lying master.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 5._\r\n\r\nI called at the Treasury and saw the Duke. On the subject of what took\r\nplace yesterday he said, that having received the King's commands to\r\ndeclare Lord Anglesey had not his permission to read the letters, he could\r\nnot do otherwise than make the observations he did. The gravamen of the\r\ncharge against Lord Anglesey as arising out of those letters is that in the\r\nlast he declares his intention of using them as public documents; and this\r\nbeing the ground upon which the King had acquiesced in his being relieved,\r\nfor the King to have afterwards permitted the reading of those letters\r\nwould have been a withdrawal of confidence from his Ministers.\r\n\r\nI met Lord Ravensworth and talked to him upon the subject. He seemed to be\r\nin a sort of alarm as to what took place yesterday. This is superfluous.\r\nThe Duke's explanation that he did not mean to say Lord Anglesey had reason\r\nto think he was permitted to read those letters was quite sufficient. The\r\nDuke added that he had understood the contrary.\r\n\r\nLord Ravensworth seemed to think his Royal master came the worst off--which\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nHe told me the Duke of Cumberland had been abusing every one at Lady\r\nBrownlow's last night, and had declared, as he has before, that he would\r\nnot go away till he had us out.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey is reported to be very ill to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 6._\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Sir G. Murray's. The Duke saw the King to-day. He was in\r\ngood humour, and said the Duke was quite right in declaring Lord Anglesey\r\nhad not his permission to read the letters. It seems the King said the same\r\nthing in the Duke of Cumberland's presence on Monday at dinner, and this\r\nmade the Duke so very angry that evening.\r\n\r\nWe had a very good division last night on the Retford question. Almost all\r\nthe Brunswickers voted with us--none against us.\r\n\r\nIn fact the Government is very strong.\r\n\r\nThere are disturbances at Manchester, which look rather serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 7._\r\n\r\nNothing in the House.\r\n\r\nThe meeting respecting the statue to the Duke of Wellington seems to have\r\nfinished in detestable taste. Hunt proposing a vote of thanks to Lord\r\nAnglesey and O'Connell, and _Lord Darnley!_ speaking for it. Both these\r\nsaid the Catholic Bill arose out of Lord Anglesey's Government. Lord\r\nDarnley repeated the same thing to me to-day in the House. I told him the\r\ncontrary was the fact. That Lord Anglesey had placed the carrying of the\r\nquestion in peril--that without his recall it could hardly have been\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nThere have been serious disturbances at Manchester. The bakers' shops have\r\nbeen broken open and robbed, and money extorted by fear. This arises out of\r\nreal distress; but it seems, as might be expected, that notorious thieves\r\nlead on the mobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 8._\r\n\r\nThe disturbances at Manchester have more the character of robbery than of\r\nriot. Baker's shops have been broken open and pillaged, and money has been\r\nextorted.\r\n\r\nAt Rochdale an attack was made on the military. They behaved with extreme\r\nforbearance; but at last fired, and killed and wounded many.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 9._\r\n\r\nDined at the Trinity House. Hardinge, whom I met there, told me Wood had\r\nbeen asked by Lord Mansfield to go to the Pitt dinner on the 28th. Wood\r\nsaid he did not know whether the Ministers would go or not. Lord Mansfield\r\nsaid, 'Why, you must know, it is understood that as soon as Parliament is\r\nup the Government will be changed. At this dinner we shall make such a\r\ndisplay of Protestant force as will enable the King to take us as his\r\nMinisters.'\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to me that any able man as Lord Mansfield is should be so\r\ndeluded by the lies of the Duke of Cumberland. The country is not agitated,\r\nit is not dissatisfied. It would repudiate, as an act of the basest\r\ntreachery, such conduct towards a Government which had been permitted to\r\ncarry a great measure, and which was displaced solely on grounds of\r\npersonal pique.\r\n\r\nManchester and its neighbourhood more quiet.\r\n\r\nHad some conversation with Peel about the next member for the direction. He\r\ninclines to Marryatt. Hardinge reported a communication from E. Ellice, who\r\ncanvasses for his brother, Russell Ellice. E. Ellice offers some votes in\r\nthe House of Commons if we will support his brother.\r\n\r\nI believe E. Ellice would be a good man, but the brother is a nonentity. I\r\nsaid we must strike at the mass and not at individuals. We must gain the\r\ncity by assisting a fit man on public grounds. Peel agreed in this\r\nsentiment. I am sure it is the only wise course for any Government to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, May 11._\r\n\r\nThe King has got the habit of taking large doses of laudanum. He sent for\r\nthe Chancellor yesterday, as usual, at two o'clock. When he got to the\r\npalace the King had taken a large dose of laudanum and was asleep. The\r\nChancellor was told he would not wake for two or three hours, and would\r\nthen be in a state of excessive irritation, so that he might just as well\r\nnot see him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 12._\r\n\r\nThe East Retford question was last night deferred till next session, so we\r\nmay, I think, finish all our business by about June 10; that is really\r\nallowing full time.\r\n\r\nO'Connell published yesterday an argument on his right to sit in the House\r\nof Commons in the shape of a letter to the members. At first Lord Grey\r\nthought it unanswerable (as founded on the provisions of the Relief Bill);\r\nbut at night he told me he had looked into the Bill and found it certainly\r\nexcluded him. A large portion of the letter is quite absurd, that in which\r\nhe assumes a right to have his claim decided in a court of law. Parliament\r\nalone is by common law the court in which the privileges of its own members\r\ncan be decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 12._\r\n\r\nHouse. Lord Lansdowne put a pompously worded question as to our intentions\r\nwith respect to the course of proceeding on Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nI answered simply that we were as sensible as he was of the extreme\r\nimportance of the question. That for my own part my mind was never absent\r\nfrom it, and that I had not been many days in office before I took measures\r\nfor procuring the most extensive information, which would be laid before\r\nthe House at the proper time. That the Government was desirous of forming\r\nits own opinion on the fullest information and with the greatest\r\nconsideration; and that we wished the House to have the same opportunities.\r\nThat I was not then prepared to inform him in what precise form we should\r\npropose that the enquiry should be made.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor introduced the Bill for appointing a new Equity Judge, and\r\nseparating the Equity Jurisdiction from the Court of Exchequer. The latter\r\nobject, by-the-bye, is not to be accomplished immediately, but it is part\r\nof the plan opened. He soothed Lord Eldon by high compliments to his\r\njudicial administration and to the correctness of his judgments. The wonder\r\nof the day is that Lord Eldon should have lived to hear a Chancellor so\r\nexpose the errors of the Court of Chancery as they were exposed by Lord\r\nLyndhurst to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 13._\r\n\r\nRecorder's report. The King not well. He has a slight stricture, of which\r\nhe makes a great deal, and a bad cold. He seemed somnolent; but I have seen\r\nhim worse.\r\n\r\nBefore the Council there was a chapter of the Garter. The Duke of Richmond\r\nwas elected. The knights wore their ordinary dress under the robe, which\r\nwas short, and had no hats. The procession was formed by Garter. The\r\nChancellor and Prelate of the Order and the Dean were present. It looked\r\nrather like a splendid funeral. The Duke of Cumberland took a great deal\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Vesey Fitzgerald's at Somerset House.\r\n\r\nMuch talk about Indian matters. Both Peel and Fitzgerald seem to be for\r\nFree Trade, and _unreasonable_ towards the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 15._\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons yesterday the motion for a Committee on East Indian\r\naffairs was negatived without a division, but promised for _early_ next\r\nsession, and papers promised immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 16._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. We spoke of the Charter. They rather dislike the notion of\r\nusing the King's name, and I fear Mr. Elphinstone and all the Indians will\r\ngive their evidence against the change. I may be outvoted, but I shall not\r\nbe convinced. [Footnote: This change was effected in 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 17._\r\n\r\nNothing political, except a grand dinner at the Duke of Norfolk's, given to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, which was very fine and very dull.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told me he had read the Persian papers. The Russians had brought\r\nit on themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 19._\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons last night O'Connell was heard at the bar. The\r\ndebate seems to have been temperate. It was decided on a discussion, 190 to\r\n116, that he must take the Oath of Supremacy.\r\n\r\nAt the office had some conversation with Mr. Leach as to the plan of\r\ngoverning India in the King's name--the Directors being made ex officio\r\nCommissioners for the affairs of India. He seems to have some prejudices\r\nagainst the plan, but he adduced no real objections. I have begged him to\r\nput on paper all the objections which occurred to him.\r\n\r\nWrote a long letter to Lord W. Bentinck on all subjects connected with the\r\nrenewal of the Charter, and the general government of India.\r\n\r\nDined at the Freemasons' Hall with the Society for Promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge. There were present 200 persons. I thought they would be very\r\nhostile to a Minister. However, when my name was mentioned by the Bishop of\r\nDurham, as a steward, there was much cheering. The Bishop of London, who\r\nwas in the chair, begged me to return thanks for the stewards, which I did.\r\nI spoke of course of the wish entertained by the Ministers that a Society\r\nmight prosper the interests of which were so much connected with those of\r\nthe Established Church--of their determination in their several departments\r\nto further its objects. It was the duty of us all as Christians, but more\r\npeculiarly that of the Ministers, to advance objects intimately connected\r\nwith the individual happiness of the people and with the stability of the\r\nState. I said something too of the intrinsic strength of the Protestant\r\nChurch--of its rising in proportion to the difficulties which might\r\nsurround it, to the dangers--if dangers there were (the Primate had spoken\r\nof them)--of its security in the zeal and ability of its ministers, and in\r\nthe purity of its doctrines.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I did well. I was loudly cheered--indeed, so much interrupted\r\nas to be enabled to think what I should say next.\r\n\r\nIndian business in the morning--Coal Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 20._\r\n\r\nDined at the London Tavern with the Directors, at what is called a family\r\ndinner, to meet Mr. Elphinstone, the late Governor of Bombay. He has been\r\nthirty-three years absent from England, having left it at fifteen. He is\r\none of the most distinguished servants the Company has ever had. He seems\r\nto be a quiet, mild, temperate man. I had some conversation with him, and\r\nhave fixed that he should come to the Indian Board on Tuesday. I wish to\r\nhave his opinion as to the expediency of governing India in the King's\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told Lord Bathurst and me the King had been very angry with him\r\nfor going to the Duke of Norfolk's dinner, and now openly expressed his\r\nwish to get rid of his Ministers. The Duke wrote to the King and told him\r\nit really was not a subject he thought it necessary to speak to him about,\r\nthat he dined with everybody and asked everybody to dinner, that had he\r\nknown beforehand who were to dine with the Duke of Norfolk, which he did\r\nnot, he could not have objected to any one of them. That the King himself\r\nhad dined with the Duke of Norfolk. That most of the persons invited were\r\neither in his Majesty's service, or had been.\r\n\r\nIt seems the king desired it might be intimated to the Duke that he was\r\nmuch displeased at the dinner, and that he and Cumberland damned us all.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke and Lord Bathurst what occurred at the dinner yesterday,\r\nwith which they were much gratified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 21._\r\n\r\nWent to the Cabinet room at 2. Read papers, by which it seems that the\r\nRussian army is very little stronger than at the commencement of the last\r\ncampaign, and that its materials are not so good. It has as yet no medical\r\nstaff. The resources of the principalities are exhausted; the cattle of the\r\npeasants have been put in requisition; the ordinary cultivation of the land\r\nhas been neglected. The river is worse than last year. There are reports of\r\nthe successes of the Turks near Varna, and of that place being in danger.\r\n\r\nThe recruiting of the Turkish army goes on well.\r\n\r\nHouse of Lords. The Chancellor's Bill, which creates a new Chancery judge.\r\nOpposition from Lord Eldon, Lord Redesdale, and Lord Holland, all saying\r\nthey wished to see the whole plan before they agree to a part. Lord\r\nTenterden approved of the making of the new judge, but wished his functions\r\nhad been better defined.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland said the Non-contents had it; but he said it too\r\nlate, and his people did not wish to divide.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry would have voted against us. I fear he is half mad. The\r\nHouse seems to treat him so.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor told me the King did many things personally uncivil to the\r\nDuke. He did not ask him to dinner to meet the Duke of Orleans. He wishes\r\nto force the Duke to offer his resignation. This he is much too prudent to\r\ndo upon a mere personal pique.\r\n\r\nThe King, our master, is the weakest man in England. He hates the Duke of\r\nCumberland. He wishes his death. He is relieved when he is away; but he is\r\nafraid of him, and crouches to him.\r\n\r\nIn reality the King never was better satisfied than with his present\r\nMinisters. He knows they will not flinch--that he is safe in their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 22._\r\n\r\nIn the House Lord Melville presented the petition of the City of London\r\npraying, if the House persisted in ordering the production of their\r\naccounts of property other than of a public nature, to be heard at the bar\r\nby counsel. He moved that this petition should be considered on Tuesday. It\r\nbeing expected that on Monday these very accounts would be produced in the\r\ncommittee, and thus the order of the House rendered unnecessary. In this we\r\nwere beaten too. Indeed, our management under Lord Melville as Admiral does\r\nnot answer.\r\n\r\nWe shall certainly lose the London Bridge Approaches Bill.\r\n\r\nDined at Lord Hill's. A party chiefly military.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 24._\r\n\r\nCabinet at Peel's at 11 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements determined upon. Lord E. Somerset to have Sir W. Clinton's\r\noffice, and Trench Mr. Singleton's. Lord Rosslyn the Privy Seal. Lord\r\nChandos was proposed, I should rather say suggested, but rejected\r\nimmediately, as not of sufficient calibre for the Cabinet. Besides, his\r\nelevation for the purpose of holding the Privy Seal would offend the\r\npeerage, and be an insult to his father. It would not gain us the\r\nBrunswickers, and we should have the Whigs hostile. It would be saying to\r\nthem, 'You shall never come in.'\r\n\r\nRosslyn's appointment will be most useful. He will be of value in the\r\nCabinet and invaluable in the House. His accession will break the Whigs, he\r\nis so popular with everybody.\r\n\r\nThis is to be proposed to the King to-morrow. It is thought he will take no\r\nstep without asking the Duke of Cumberland. He may refuse altogether. Then\r\nwe go out. The legal arrangements cannot proceed, because Best [Footnote:\r\nAfterwards Lord Wynford.] communicated with the Duke of Cumberland and\r\nrefused a peerage as the _condition_ of resignation. Alexander would go if\r\nhe could have his peerage and a pension. Leach will not go unless he is to\r\nhave a peerage and a pension of 7,000£ a year, a thing impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 25._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. Waited a long time for the Duke. He came smiling and\r\nvictorious. The King said he would manage Best. To Rosslyn he made some\r\nobjection, and suggested Lord Dudley or Melbourne. This was referred to and\r\nrejected by such of the Cabinet as could be on a sudden collected at the\r\nForeign Office. I was not there. I should certainly have rejected both,\r\nalthough very willing to have Dudley. The other would never have done. With\r\nLord E. Somerset and Trench the King was well pleased. As the Duke left the\r\nroom the King said, 'Come, you must acknowledge I have behaved well to\r\nyou.' This he said frankly and good-humouredly. The Duke said, 'I assure\r\nyour Majesty I am very sensible of it, and I feel very grateful to you.'\r\n\r\nHaving thus established ourselves as a Government we were going to break\r\nour necks by attempting to pass the Chancellor's Bill, which the House of\r\nCommons does not like. However, after a talk, it was resolved to give it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Tories have deserted us again. We are much in want of winter\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the House we had the City of London petition. I took a more active part\r\nthan usual in the conversation.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn, having just lost his son, is gone to Tunbridge Wells, and the\r\noffer of the Privy Seal will be postponed till after to-morrow, when the\r\nKing is to see Best at two, and it is hoped the Duke may be able to tell\r\nRosslyn that Scarlett is to be Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 26._\r\n\r\nThe King sent Knighton for Chief Justice Best, and desired him not to tell\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland; Best was sent for. So Best went, and accepted the\r\nterms offered. Thus we shall get Scarlett, and the King and the Duke be\r\nseparated a little.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Duke of Wellington did his business with the King while the\r\nDuke of Cumberland was hearing a clause in the House of Lords. The\r\nChancellor, knowing how the Duke of Wellington was occupied, kept the Duke\r\nof Cumberland as long as he could.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 27._\r\n\r\nCommittee on London Bridge. Lord Londonderry, who came from the review in\r\nhis uniform just covered by a frock coat, spoke against time on a\r\ncollateral point for an hour and a half, and disgusted the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 28._\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge Committee. Lord Londonderry a little better than before, but\r\nnot much. He is running down his character altogether. He has now formed an\r\nalliance with the Duke of Cumberland, and through him made his peace with\r\nthe King. The Duke of Cumberland wishes to be reconciled to the Duke of\r\nWellington. In the House of Commons there is a small Ultra-Tory party, not\r\nfifty. In our House I doubt whether there are twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 30._\r\n\r\nChairs. Lord W. Bentinck seems to be so ill as to make it doubtful whether\r\nhe can remain in India should he recover. The letter is dated January 27.\r\nHe was then in danger. The vessel did not leave Calcutta till the 30th. The\r\nnews then was that he was better, and had sat up for six hours. It was a\r\n_coup de soleil_.\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Duke showed me a letter from Lord Rosslyn, accepting most cordially the\r\nPrivy Seal.\r\n\r\nI suppose we shall have a Council on Monday, or on some early day next\r\nweek, for me to give it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 1._\r\n\r\nTo the Cabinet room.\r\n\r\nThere is a report that Varna [Footnote: Varna was in the hands of the\r\nRussians, having been taken in the previous campaign.] is _cernée_ by\r\n40,000 men, Bazardjik taken, the Russians running from Karasan, and from\r\n6,000 to 8,000 Russians, who had been thrown over the Danube at Hirsova,\r\ndriven into it at Czernavoda by the garrison of Silistria. [Footnote: These\r\nreports seem to have been unfounded. Soon after this date the decisive\r\nbattle of Kouleftcha opened to the Russians the road to Adrianople.]\r\nClanwilliam wrote me he thought the Duke attached some credit to this last\r\nrumour.\r\n\r\nNews from Calcutta of February 1 states that Lord William Bentinck was then\r\nout of danger. Lady William, who was going to set off to join him, had\r\ndetermined to expect him at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn's appointment is in the newspapers to-day. The 'Times' highly\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 2._\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge Approaches Committee. Lord Londonderry very anxious to have\r\nan adjournment over the Derby; however, he must attend to 'the last\r\nconcern.'\r\n\r\nHouse. Anatomy Bill put off till Friday. The Bishops, Lord Malmesbury, and\r\nmany others very hostile to it.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that the Russians have recrossed the Danube. I am inclined\r\nto think they have been beaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 3._\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford is dead; a great Grecian is to succeed him.\r\n\r\nThe King is in excellent humour. The Duke of Cumberland rather going down.\r\n\r\nWe had some talk about the Anatomy Bill. The Duke is afraid of passing it.\r\nIndeed, it is not a Government measure. Probably it will be withdrawn for\r\nthe year. The Bishops are very hostile to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 4._\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge Committee from eleven till four. We made great progress in\r\nour evidence, and, indeed, nearly proved our case. From four to five we had\r\na very painful discussion in consequence of some words which passed between\r\nLord Durham and Lord Beresford. We succeeded at last in settling the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nLord Beresford, having no good word at his disposal, said he did not second\r\nthe _evil deeds_ or _improprieties_ of noble lords. He really meant\r\n_irregularities_, and irregularities only as a member of the Committee.\r\nLord Grey was present and much distressed. The Duke of Wellington's\r\nauthority induced both to become amenable to the wish of the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 5._\r\n\r\nAnatomy Bill. Some talk; but a general agreement suggested by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, that the Bill should be read a second time, and\r\nnot proceeded with this session. The Duke of Wellington expressed his\r\ngeneral approbation of the principle, but thought postponement desirable.\r\nHe pledged himself to _cooperate_ in bringing in a Bill on the same\r\nprinciple, and having the same objects, next year; but did not pledge\r\nhimself to bring it in himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 7._\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past three. First question: whether we should extend the\r\ntime for putting an end altogether to the Brazilian slave trade from March\r\n13 to September 13, 1830, for the equivalent of obtaining for ever the\r\nright to seize ships fitted up for the slave trade, whether they had slaves\r\non board or not. The Brazilians have been encouraged by their Government to\r\ninterpret the treaty as permitting the return of any vessels quitting the\r\nBrazils on slave expeditions before March 13.\r\n\r\nDr. Lushington, who was consulted by Aberdeen, seemed to think it was worth\r\nwhile to obtain the concession, but still seemed to think that by extending\r\nthe time, we should permit the transportation of a very large number of\r\nslaves, of whom many might be destroyed by ill-treatment, and that it was\r\nhardly justifiable with a view to a distant advantage, to sacrifice\r\nimmediately and certainly a great number of persons.\r\n\r\nThis prevailed--the real fact being that Peel does not like awkward\r\nquestions in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSo the treaty remains as it is, and both parties will interpret it as they\r\nplease. There will be many disputes, for the interpretation is very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 8._\r\n\r\nReceived a private letter from Colonel Macdonald at Tabriz, with copies of\r\nletters received by him from a gentleman he had sent to Teheran on hearing\r\nof the massacre of the Russian mission; and from another gentleman,\r\ntravelling unofficially, who first heard the report between Tabriz and\r\nKamsin.\r\n\r\nThese accounts only confirm what we had already heard of the arrogance and\r\nviolence of the Russians. They deserved their fate.\r\n\r\nColonel Macdonald says that General Paskewitz cannot dispose of more than\r\n25,000, or, at most, 30,000 men, although he has a nominal force of 110,000\r\nmen under his command.\r\n\r\nColonel Macdonald says there has been no serious resistance on the part of\r\nthe Turks, except at Akhalsik.\r\n\r\nHe has done what he can to dissuade them from war with the Russians; but I\r\nthink the universal feeling of the people will propel them.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection at Teheran appears to have been instigated by the Mollahs\r\nand the women, but it was evidently national, or it must have failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 10._\r\n\r\nCouncil. Lord Winford kissed hands. He walked in with great difficulty on\r\ntwo crutches, which he placed behind him and so leant back upon. The King\r\nhad a chair brought for him, and had him wheeled out. The man who pushed\r\nhis chair very nearly shipwrecked him at the door.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General (Scarlett), [Footnote: Afterwards Lord Abinger.] the\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas (Tindal), and the Solicitor-General\r\n(Sugden), [Footnote: Afterwards Lord St. Leonards. Lord Chancellor 1862. ]\r\nall kissed hands. The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was sworn in as\r\nPrivy Councillor. Lord Rosslyn was sworn in as Privy Councillor and Privy\r\nSeal. The King did not address a word to me, who gave up the seal, or to\r\nRosslyn, who received it.\r\n\r\nHouse. Nothing of moment.\r\n\r\nDinner at Lord Bathurst's. Lord Rosslyn dined here.\r\n\r\nAberdeen read a paper lately received from the Russians, in which they\r\nconcede all we ask about blockades, &c., except as to the Gulf of Enos. The\r\nDuke says he shall bring Lièven to the point about this, and generally\r\nabout their views. He feels the Government is stronger now than it was--\r\nthat the country is stronger, and we may insist more. He says the question\r\nis, 'Shall we permit the ruin of the Turkish Empire?' I have long felt that\r\nto be the case, and to that I answer 'No.'\r\n\r\nWe had some conversation as to the charter. The Duke seems rather inclined\r\nto continue the _name_ of the Company. I am for the _name_ of the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 11._\r\n\r\nThe world has had imposed upon it a story of the Chancellor's _selling_ his\r\nChurch preferment. The 'Age' is to bring forward its charges on Sunday\r\nnext. This is an arrow from the Cumberland quiver.\r\n\r\nI mentioned Lord Clare's wish to look forward to the Government of Bombay\r\nor Madras to the Duke last night, and he did not by any means receive the\r\nproposition unfavourably. I told Clare so to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 13._\r\n\r\nGaisford has refused the Bishopric of Oxford--wisely, for he was only a\r\nGrecian and had good preferment. He is a rough man too. I am glad he has\r\nrefused it. I do not think mere Grecians good bishops.\r\n\r\nLord Clare told me Glengall was to be the new Irish peer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 15._\r\n\r\nCommittee as usual. Lord Londonderry more insane than ever. The Duke said\r\nhe had never seen anything more painful.\r\n\r\nWe made hardly any progress. The victory will belong to the _survivors_,\r\nand I do not think Lord Durham will be one of them.\r\n\r\nHouse. Lord Londonderry made a foolish speech, and the Duke an excellent\r\none, very severe upon him, and defending the City. If we do not get the\r\nCity by this Committee the City is impregnable.\r\n\r\nHardinge told me Lord Grey seemed out of humour. I do not think he is in\r\ngood humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 16._\r\n\r\nAt last some hope of a compromise respecting London Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 17._\r\n\r\nThe eternal Committee is, I trust, at an end. The agents have come to a\r\ncompromise, and if the Common Council should confirm the terms, as I\r\nconclude they will, the thing will be at an end. We shall then have\r\nParliament up by Monday or Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Lord Melville's. The Duke was astonished at Lord W.\r\nBentinck's strong and sudden step of transferring the Supreme Government\r\n_pro tempore_ to Meerut. He said he always expected some wild measure from\r\nLord W. Meerut was in too exposed a situation.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand Afghan horse might ride in upon the seat of government if\r\nplaced in the north-west provinces. It is astonishing how much the Duke is\r\nprejudiced by his old Indian feelings. Whatever _is_ he thinks best. Meerut\r\nis ill and absurdly chosen, but Calcutta is certainly the worst chosen seat\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nWe are to have a Cabinet on Saturday for the King's speech. On Monday or\r\nTuesday Parliament will be up. On Wednesday we dine at the India House, and\r\non the Monday following, the 29th, will be the fish dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 18._\r\n\r\nCalled to compliment the Duke on the anniversary of Waterloo. Left with him\r\nLord W. Bentinck's minute and despatch on transferring the Supreme\r\nGovernment Departments and all _pro tempore_ to Meerut, and a proposed\r\nletter, censuring the Governor for having done this without previous\r\nsanction, and directing the members of Council and the Departments to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe Duke objects to any removal of the seat of government to the upper\r\nprovinces. It would there be exposed to the sudden inroads of cavalry. In\r\nIndia a cloud of cavalry rises like a squall in the Mediterranean. At\r\nCalcutta the Government, protected by the rivers, is safe, and always\r\naccessible from England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 19._\r\n\r\nRode to town. Met Rosslyn. He told me Lord Clanrickarde [Footnote: Lord\r\nClanrickarde was son-in-law of Mr. Canning.] intended to make some\r\nobservations on foreign policy this evening.\r\n\r\nHad some conversation with the Duke. He doubted whether the Supreme\r\nGovernment _could_ leave Calcutta and preserve its powers. I told him of\r\nthe newspaper report of to-day that leases for sixty years were to be given\r\nto indigo planters, and this without any authority from home. He seems to\r\nhave suspected from the first that Lord W. would do some monstrous thing,\r\nand certainly he does seem to be emancipating himself.\r\n\r\nHouse. Lord Clanrickarde made his little speech. Aberdeen his. Then Lord\r\nHolland, and then the Duke. Afterwards Goderich. Lord Holland talked as\r\nusual very vaguely. No notice had been given, and few people knew there was\r\nanything to be done. So ends the House for this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 20, 1829._\r\n\r\nCabinet. King's speech. Some time occupied in wording it, but no material\r\nalterations. Aberdeen's the worst part. The King is made to _auspicate_ and\r\nto pray, but not to trust that the Franchise Bill and the Relief Bill will\r\nbe productive of good.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor has prosecuted the 'Morning Journal' for a libel accusing\r\nhim of having taken money for Sugden's appointment as Solicitor-General. I\r\nheard him tell Lord Bathurst, with reference to another calumny against\r\nhim, that he had fortunately preserved through his secretary the grounds on\r\nwhich he had given every living he had disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 21._\r\n\r\nHad a visit from Loch. He wishes the despatch to Lord William to be worded\r\nmore gently, as he thinks Lord William _meant_ well. This shall be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 22._\r\n\r\nWrote draft paragraphs to the effect above stated to Lord W. Bentinck, and\r\nadded a paragraph giving the Duke's reasoning against the removal of the\r\nGovernment from Calcutta to the north-west provinces.\r\n\r\nI had some conversation in the House with Lord Lauderdale on China trade,\r\n&c. He seems friendly to the Company and to the Government.\r\n\r\nWent to the House at 4. Found a good many peers there. By mere mistake a\r\nBill, slightly and necessarily amended by the Lords, was not sent down to\r\nthe Commons, although directions to that effect were given, and it by\r\naccident was placed amongst the Bills ready for the Royal assent. So it\r\nreceived the Royal assent. It became necessary to pass a Bill to make this\r\nBill valid in law. Lord Shaftesbury thought our House ought to inform the\r\nCommons we had discovered the error; but the Speaker, [Footnote: C. Manners\r\nSutton, afterwards Lord Canterbury.] to make a flourish, insisted on\r\nannouncing it first to the House of Commons. All the steps to be taken were\r\nsettled between the Speaker, Lord Shaftesbury, and Courtenay. When I went\r\ndown I found it had not been settled that anything should be done first by\r\nus. I suggested that Lord Shaftesbury should acquaint the House with the\r\ncircumstance, and that we should appoint a Committee to inquire before the\r\nmessage from the Commons came up. This was done.\r\n\r\nWe ordered a message to be sent, but before our messengers left the House\r\nwe heard the Commons would not receive a message, so I moved that the order\r\nwe had just made should be rescinded, and we had a second conference. The\r\nCommons were well satisfied with our reply. The last sentence had been,\r\n'The Lords hope the Commons will be satisfied with this explanation.' As we\r\nin the first paragraph expressed our desire to preserve a good\r\nunderstanding between the two Houses, and in the second one regret that\r\nthis mistake had taken place, I thought it was going too far to express _a\r\nhope_ only that our explanation would be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWe inserted 'the Lords _doubt not_,' instead of 'the Lords _hope_.'\r\n\r\nAt night received a letter from the Duke of Wellington, saying he thought\r\nwe might get Courtenay to resign at once and get in Lord Chandos. I am to\r\nsee him at ten to-morrow on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 23, 1829._\r\n\r\nWrote early to the Chairs and begged them to come to me immediately. Sent\r\nLoch the Duke's note and told him why Lord Chandos's being brought in was\r\nof so much importance. Saw the Duke at 10. The King was very much out of\r\nhumour yesterday. He wanted to make Nash a baronet. The Duke refused. The\r\nKing then went upon his Speech, which he did not like and had altered. He\r\nleft out the specific mention of the Relief and Franchise Bill, and there\r\nhe was right, and he converted the prayer that the measure might\r\ntranquillise Ireland, &c., into a _hope_ that it would--thus making it a\r\nlittle stronger, but that he did not know.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland, on hearing of Castlereagh's appointment, said,\r\n'Whoever ratted he would not,' alluding to Lord Londonderry, who has been\r\nnibbling at the Cumberland faction. However, Lord Londonderry is much\r\nannoyed at Castlereagh's taking office. He neither likes the expense of an\r\nelection for Downshire, nor losing a vote he thought he could dispose of.\r\n\r\nHardinge will not sit again for Durham. Without Hardinge Lord Londonderry\r\nwill have trouble enough there.\r\n\r\nThe King was much out of humour during the Chapter of the Garter, and said\r\neverything was done wrong.\r\n\r\nSaw the Chairs. They had just got a letter from Sir John Malcolm, resigning\r\nfrom December 1, 1830. This would have been in any case a long time for\r\nCourtenay to wait out of office; but they said the idea of his being\r\nproposed had got wind, and several of the Directors were very adverse.\r\nNeither of the Chairs likes him, and if they supported him they would do it\r\nvery reluctantly. As Loch goes out of office in April, and we cannot tell\r\nwho will be deputy, and six new Directors come in, there really are not the\r\nmeans of saying to Courtenay, 'You are sure of your election,' and without\r\nthis he could not be asked to resign.\r\n\r\nI took the Chairs to the Duke. He received them very cordially, told them I\r\nhad stated the circumstances to him, and he gave up the point.\r\n\r\nWe then talked of the legality of the removal of the Supreme Government\r\nfrom Calcutta. On looking into the acts it seems very doubtful whether any\r\nact done by the Governor-General in Council away from Calcutta would be\r\nvalid unless it were one of the acts the Governor-General might do of his\r\nown authority. For instance, 'a regulation' issued by the Governor-General\r\nin Council at Meerut would not be valid, because the Governor-General alone\r\ncould not issue one.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said Lord William did everything with the best intentions; but he\r\nwas a _wrong-headed man_, and if he went wrong he would continue in the\r\nwrong line. Other men might go wrong and find it out, and go back; but if\r\nhe went wrong he would either not find it out, or, if he did, he would not\r\ngo back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 24._\r\n\r\nSat as Commissioner to prorogue Parliament. The King's alteration in the\r\nSpeech certainly made it better and stronger. He now expresses his _sincere\r\nhope_ the measures of the session will produce tranquillity, &c. People\r\nthought the Speech rather short and jejune.\r\n\r\nDined at the 'Albion' with the Directors. The dinner was given to Lord\r\nDalhousie. There were there the Duke, the Chancellor, Peel, Sir J. Murray,\r\nLord Rosslyn and Goulburn, the Speaker, the Attorney General, Courtenay,\r\nAshley, and Bankes; Duke of Buccleuch, Lord Camden, Lord Montagu, Lord\r\nHill, Sir Herbert Taylor, Sir Byam Martin, Sir A. Dickson, Colonel Houston,\r\nLord Dalhousie, and Sir Sidney Beckwith, and their aides-de-camp; a great\r\nmany Directors, and in all rather more than 100 people.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, in returning thanks, spoke of the cordiality and good\r\nunderstanding existing between the Directors and the Government, _which was\r\nnever more necessary to the Company than now_.\r\n\r\nI said the good understanding would always exist while such men as Loch\r\nwere in the chair, and while I was at the Board of Control. I paid a high\r\ncompliment to Loch, and then congratulated them on the appointments of the\r\ntwo Generals. Their mildness of manner, their benevolence of character, and\r\nthe goodness of their natures would obtain for them the affectionate\r\ndevotion of a grateful soldiery, and, educated in a school of continued\r\nvictories, they were the fittest leaders of an army which had never met an\r\nenemy it had not subdued. I ended by saying I was sure they would devote\r\nthemselves to the maintenance under all circumstances, not only of the\r\nefficiency, but of an object which they would pursue with equal interest--\r\n_of the happiness and well-being of the native army of India_. I spoke\r\nrather well, was attentively heard, and well received. I sat by the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch. We had a good deal of conversation. He seems a fine young man.\r\nLord Rosslyn complained he could never see a draft till it was a month old,\r\nand that there had been no new despatches placed in the boxes since he came\r\ninto office. I told him no one complained more of the same thing than\r\nAberdeen did when Dudley was in office, and I believe all Foreign\r\nSecretaries had a shyness about showing their drafts till they were sent\r\noff and unalterable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 25._\r\n\r\nAt the office found a letter with enclosures from Colonel Macdonald, dated\r\nTabriz April 20. What he has been doing in Persia I do not know.\r\n\r\nI have written to him to call upon me on Saturday.\r\n\r\nCalled on the Duke to tell him the substance--which is, that the Turks have\r\nalready 30,000 men and sixty pieces of cannon at Erzeroum. That a\r\ndispossessed Pacha is in arms at Akiska. That the Russians have reinforced\r\nthe garrisons of Natshiran and Abbasabad, and have withdrawn all their\r\ntroops to the left bank of the Araxes, with the exception of those who\r\ngarrison Bayazid. The plague seems rife at Erivan. The Russians about Count\r\nPaskewitz abuse the English very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 27._\r\n\r\nThe Chairs told me Lord W. Bentinck had extended to all persons the benefit\r\nof the regulation as to coffee planters, _omitting, however_, all the\r\nrestrictive clauses. They think very seriously of this, and very justly.\r\nThe Calcutta newspapers consider the principle of colonisation to be\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\nWe must abrogate this 'Regulation' without loss of time. I went to the Duke\r\nto tell him of it. He said Lord W. Bentinck was not to be trusted, and we\r\nshould be obliged to recall him. He is gone down in a steamboat to Penang.\r\n\r\nNo news of much importance at the Cabinet room, except that Lord\r\nHeytesbury's despatches confirm the account of the sickness of the Russian\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe Turks seem to have given the Russians a great smash at Eski Arnaut.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 30._\r\n\r\nA battle near Schumla between the Russians and Turks. The Turks were\r\nbesieging Pravadi. Diebitsch marched from Silistria and moved upon their\r\ncommunications with Schumla. The Turks seem to have been surprised. They\r\nfought gallantly, however, and seem to have caused the Russians great loss.\r\n\r\nSaw Arbuthnot. He came to the India Board to speak about his friend,\r\nRussell Ellice, whom he wishes to make a Director. We afterwards talked of\r\nthe House and the Government. I think all will turn out well. We have six\r\nmonths before us, but certainly at present we are weak in the House of\r\nCommons, though I believe gathering strength in the country, and already\r\nvery strong there. If we play the great game, striking at the mass, we must\r\nsucceed. It would never do to go picking up individuals. We must do our\r\nbest for the country, and we shall have it with us. The worst of it is, the\r\nKing is the most faithless of men, and Cumberland is at work.\r\n\r\nThe Duke asked Hardinge the other day what he thought of the Government. He\r\nsaid he thought that by losing Canningites and Brunswickers it was fifty\r\nweaker than Lord Liverpool's, and these fifty go the other way, making a\r\ndifference of one hundred on a division. Lord Camden thought if the\r\nBrunswickers would not come in we must get a few Whigs--Abercromby, Sir\r\nJames Graham, the Althorpe people. Stanley would come for anything good,\r\nand Brougham too.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot asked me if I thought Lord Rosslyn would be cordial with us. I\r\nsaid Yes. His letter of acceptance was most cordial, and with the Lords he\r\nwas on excellent terms. The only danger would be if Peel and the Commoners\r\nwere shy.\r\n\r\nLord Grey, I said, I did not think in very good humour, but he would differ\r\non foreign politics rather than on questions of a domestic nature. The Duke\r\nwill not be coquetting with him, because he says very honestly he should be\r\nexciting expectations in Lord Grey which, while the King lives, he does not\r\nthink he can gratify.\r\n\r\nSaw Mr. Elphinstone by appointment. I wished to have his opinion with\r\nregard to the new settlement of Indian Government, which may take place on\r\nthe expiration of the present Charter. He seemed to think that the\r\nAdministration of the Government in the King's name would be agreeable to\r\nthe Civil and Military Services, and to people in England. He doubted\r\nwhether, as regarded the princes of India, it would signify much, as they\r\nnow pretty well understood us. He doubted whether the orders of Government\r\nhere would be better obeyed. He thought there might be an advantage in\r\nkeeping the King's authority in reserve, to be used only on grand\r\noccasions. He confessed, however, that 'having been educated, and having\r\nlived under the existing system, he was not best qualified to propose to\r\nanother. He had his prejudices.' He thought the best mode of arriving at\r\nthe truth would be by taking the opinions of practical Indians as to\r\nreforms and alterations suggested by theoretical men.\r\n\r\nI asked him to consider the expediency of dividing the territory as now\r\ninto three unequal Presidencies, of giving to the Governor-General the\r\nlabour of superintending the Administration in detail of the Bengal\r\nPresidency--of having Members of Council. I told him there were many minor\r\npoints of detail discoverable only by those employed at home, which\r\nrequired and must receive amendment. Such, for instance, is the\r\ninterpretation given to the Act of Parliament, by which a _regulation_ must\r\nbe sanctioned or rejected _in extenso,_ there being no power to alter a\r\nword, or to reject part and take the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. Elphinstone seems to dread a long peace in India. We hold everything\r\ntogether by the Native Army, and we cannot retain that unless we retain the\r\naffections of the European officers. In the present state of our finances\r\nthis is difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 1._\r\n\r\nAt half-past five received a letter from the Chairman, and the draft\r\nrelative to the removal of the Governor from Calcutta. The Court wished to\r\nhave it back to-day. That was impossible; but they have omitted words I\r\ninserted in the _précis,_ and must restore, declaring that had the removal\r\nbeen legal, still the Members of Council would have been ordered back. I\r\nhave now been obliged to give reasons for this addition, and the reasons\r\nwill be so much worse, as matters of record, that I have suggested to the\r\nChairman he had better substitute a draft containing the words.\r\n\r\nI think we must detain the _Pallas_ that it may take out both letters--this\r\nand the one relating to the leases which is not yet prepared, or we must\r\nhave an overland dispatch.\r\n\r\nDelay is one of the inconveniences attending the present system of Indian\r\nGovernment. I told the Chairman in my private note that if we allowed Lord\r\nW. Bentinck to emancipate himself in this manner we should really be\r\nabandoning all real control over the Government of India. I see clearly\r\nthere is a Bentinck party in the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 2._\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge. We had some conversation upon the subject of the Government.\r\nHe seems more alarmed than I am. I trust to the King's fears and the Duke's\r\nfortune; besides, we have the country.\r\n\r\nHardinge told me the King was very much out of humour. The admission of\r\nLord Rosslyn had not answered. None followed. Lord Durham, Calthorpe, and\r\nothers left Lord Lansdowne to coalesce with Lord Grey. Hardinge wished me\r\nto try Herries again, with the view of opening the Mint by making him\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in India; but I told him Herries said his\r\ndomestic circumstances made it impossible, and the Duke did not seem to\r\nlike it at all.\r\n\r\nHerries thinks Lord Durham would be glad to be Minister at Naples; for my\r\npart I am sure nothing will win Lord Grey but a place for Lord Grey\r\nhimself, and _that_, in the present state of the King's mind, the Duke is\r\nnot in a condition to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 4._\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past three.\r\n\r\nThe Duke read a list of the several points to be considered before the next\r\nSession. I cannot recollect half of them. East India Charter; Bank Charter;\r\nUsury Laws; East Retford; Duties on Sugar; Duties on Tobacco; Canada; West\r\nIndies; Education in Ireland; Irish and English Churches; Poor in Ireland;\r\nPublic Works; Commission on Ecclesiastical Courts; Reform of English\r\nCourts; Reform of Welsh Judicature; Reform of Courts of Equity; Scotch Law\r\nof Entail; Salaries of Scotch Judges--_increase_; Salaries of English\r\nJudges--_reduction_; Grand Juries, Ireland; Militia Laws; Stamp Duties,\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe only talk we had was about Irish Poor, and Public Works in Ireland. The\r\nfeeling seemed against anything like Poor Laws, and against Public Works\r\ntoo. This is mine. The first productive of mischief, the second useless.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it is a great hardship that the English parish should have the\r\nburden of Irish poor, but on the other hand in many cases the payers of\r\npoor's rates in these parishes have derived advantage from Irish labour.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald, Peel, and Goulburn are to look into this subject, and all\r\nconnected with Ireland.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald, Peel, Lord Rosslyn, and, I think, either Herries or Goulburn\r\nseemed to think the opposition to the continuance of the China monopoly\r\nwould be much greater than we expected. Fitzgerald seemed desirous the\r\nquestion of commerce should be reserved, and that of Government decided. I\r\ntold him the two were inseparably connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 6._\r\n\r\nWrote to Lord W. Bentinck telling him I much regretted the having been\r\nobliged to send the two letters, relative to the removal of the Government,\r\nand the leases--told him the Duke coincided in opinion with the Court.\r\n\r\nI then expressed my surprise that the Local Government did not obey better.\r\nSaid they seemed to forget the orders of the Directors were the King's\r\norders transmitted through the channel of the Court and the Board. I added\r\nI should endeavour to introduce into every branch of Indian Government the\r\nsubordination and the improvements now established in the King's\r\nservice--depended on his co-operation, &c. I sent the letter to the Duke\r\nto ask him if I should send it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 7._\r\n\r\nAt quarter to six a messenger arrived from the Duke, to whom I sent\r\nyesterday my letter to Lord W. asking if I should send it? The Duke desires\r\nto see the despatches to which it refers. I have accordingly begged Jones\r\nto send them to him. I shall however be in town early myself to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke in my note I should stay in town till late to-morrow to\r\nsign the letter as to the six regiments if they passed it. I am glad to\r\nhave an excuse for not going to Windsor to the Recorder's Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 8._\r\n\r\nOffice at 2. Wilson absent, so I could not transact any military business.\r\nCarried the letters relative to the leases and the six regiments to the\r\nDuke. He said mine about the regiments was _very good indeed_.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia seems to have laid himself out most ably at Berlin to\r\ncaptivate the King, and the army, and the people.\r\n\r\nSeymour's despatches are useful. He mentions _small_ things, which show the\r\ncharacter of men.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor does not disguise his desire of peace. He wants no _garanties\r\nmatérielles_ at the Bosphorus for safe passage. He asks the principle of a\r\npecuniary indemnity, but does not seem disposed to contest the details.\r\nBernstorff observed truly, we could not get out of the Greek Treaty without\r\nthe help of Russia, and Russia wanted us to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan begins to affect European manners. Calls upon ladies and talks\r\nabout education! Dines with a merchant! After all, considering his\r\neducation and his _entourage_, Sultan Mahmoud is the most remarkable man in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 9._\r\n\r\nOffice at 2. Met Herries. Told him I should send him a statement of our\r\nIndian loans, and place Leach at his disposal. We could then talk them\r\nover, and see whether we could effect any financial operation. My idea is\r\nthat by offering some little higher interest in. India we might induce the\r\nholders of the remittable loan to give up that privilege of receiving the\r\ninterest in England if resident here.\r\n\r\nSaw Major Cunningham. He looks more than forty, well, certainly, but I\r\nshould doubt his doing much hard work. He does not think himself a good\r\nperson to command Irregulars. His Rohillas were almost in as good order as\r\nRegulars.\r\n\r\nHe told me Lieutenant-Colonel Skinner was a man of large landed property.\r\nHe had raised his corps very much from his own estate and neighbourhood,\r\nand was a sort of feudal chieftain. He has been educated like a native,\r\nthough the son of a Colonel in the Company's service.\r\n\r\nSaw Sir Murray Maxwell. [Footnote: He had commanded the 'Alceste,' which\r\ntook out Lord Amherst as Ambassador to China twelve years before.] It\r\nseemed to me Sir Murray wanted to be sent with a frigate to try to open a\r\ncommercial communication with Pekin. He thinks even Japan might be induced\r\nto trade. The instant the Chinese found the ship was gone and Lord Amherst\r\nmeant to return by land they would have nothing to say to him. They\r\nprobably took him for a spy.\r\n\r\nSir Murray thinks the Chinese might be led to give a port to the northward.\r\n\r\nHe describes the Spanish population of Manilla as being very small--the\r\nnative population large. It is but four days' sail, with a good breeze,\r\nfrom Manilla to Canton. Always a favourable wind. The harbour magnificent.\r\n\r\nI think the whole object of his visit was to get a ship, and a sort of half\r\nembassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 10._\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Lord Clare, who saw the Duke yesterday. He says the\r\nDuke was very kind and told him he should get all the information he could\r\nbefore the Committee of next year. I shall most willingly assist him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 11._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Talked of Ireland. The disposition to outrage seems increasing.\r\nThe Duke said we were responsible for the success of the measure of this\r\nyear, and we must put down the armed meetings. Warburton must be ordered to\r\ndo so. The Duke said emphatically if we do not preserve the peace of\r\nIreland we shall not be a Government. Peel is to write immediately. He\r\nthinks the first appearance of a determination to put down these meetings\r\nwill have the effect of crushing them. We spoke of Poor Laws, Education,\r\nand Grand Juries. Lord F. Leveson _despairs_ as to the two first. Upon both\r\nthe Government will form its opinion. I am glad to see that the more the\r\nquestion of Poor Laws is considered the more the introduction of them\r\nappears unadvisable, _or of any approach to them_. I have ever held this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIn Cabinet we again, having done so many weeks ago, considered whether any\r\nextension of time should be given to the Brazilians for the termination of\r\ntheir traffic in slaves.\r\n\r\nAberdeen seemed very indulgently inclined towards the slave dealers--not so\r\nPeel and Fitzgerald. They seemed first of all to think it would be an\r\nawkward Parliamentary case, and Peel protested against our becoming\r\nresponsible, as we should, for the horrible consequences which might attend\r\nthe continuance of the trade for six months. The Chancellor thought a\r\nvessel leaving the coast of Africa, that is, engaging in the slave trade,\r\nat such a period as would afford a reasonable probability of her arriving\r\non March 13, should be safe. I think February 13 was, after much desultory\r\ndiscussion, fixed as the day after which no vessel should leave the coast\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilians had offered as an equivalent for six months an agreement\r\nthat in future vessels fitted for the slave trade, even if they had no\r\nslaves on board, should be seizable. It seemed to be the opinion, a little\r\nexaggerated, I think, that no prospect of future prevention of slave-\r\ntrading could justify us in permitting for an instant the immediate benefit\r\nwe had within our grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 12._\r\n\r\nThe great day in Ireland; but I hope its happening on Sunday may break its\r\neffect. The orders for vigorous interposition, determined upon on Saturday,\r\nwill have been of no use in preventing collision to-day, or even to-morrow,\r\nshould the anniversary be postponed.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland goes to Hanover, but he returns in October, and old\r\nEldon meets him then in London. They had a regular Cabinet to decide\r\nwhether he should go or not.\r\n\r\nRead the court-martial of Lieutenant Lewis, of the Bombay Artillery, who\r\nstruck an officer in the presence of his wife. The Chairs wish to restore\r\nhim. It is impossible. There is an end of all moral and gentlemanlike\r\nfeeling if it be not understood that a man's person is sacred in the\r\npresence of his wife. We presume a wife to have feeling, and a man to\r\nrespect it. _The blow_ alone would have been a good cause of dismissal.\r\n\r\nHad a letter from the Bishop of Calcutta, who, on offering to execute\r\nepiscopal functions at the Cape, was told by Hay, of the Colonial Office,\r\nthat the cape was not in his Patent, and he could no do so. This is a\r\nmistake. He can exercise episcopal functions, but not episcopal\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\nHad a letter from Mr. Joliffe, of Merstham, [Footnote: The seat of the\r\nJoliffe family, near Reigate, in Surrey.] proposing steam-boat navigation\r\nto India. An application from Salisbury for a letter of recommendation to\r\nLord W. Bentinck, in favour of Mr. Chester. Told him this was not a good\r\ntime to ask a favour of Lord William, and it would be better to send the\r\nrecommendation with the man, who does not sail till October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 15, 1829._\r\n\r\nOffice. Found a letter from Loch, suggesting the irregularity of my sending\r\nfor his officers, and communicating with them on the subject of despatches\r\nto be sent to the Indian Government, and expressing a hope that nothing\r\nwould occur to interrupt the harmony which existed between us.\r\n\r\nI said in reply that I have expressed a wish to see Colonel Salmond, and\r\nafterwards to see Colonel Farant, merely from my desire to expedite\r\nbusiness, and to do it well. That it was mentioned in conversation with\r\nColonel Salmond and Mr. Wilson on Monday, that there was no irregularity in\r\nthat course, and that I immediately determined to desist from it. That I\r\nbelieved I had so expressed myself at the time to Colonel Salmond.\r\n\r\nI added that I could assure him I would not willingly, by endeavouring to\r\nextend the limits assigned by Parliament to the power of the Board, or by\r\nmy manner of exercising that power, interrupt the harmony which so happily\r\nexisted between the court and me.\r\n\r\nWent to the Foreign Office. I fear the defeat of the Turks near Shumla was\r\ndecisive; but still we have only Russian accounts, and they do _so lie_! It\r\nseems certain the Russians took the opportunity of opening a negotiation.\r\nThe carelessness of the Turks in not keeping a good look-out towards\r\nSilistria seems unaccountable, and they dawdled sadly before Pravady. The\r\nnew Vizier is very inferior to old Hussein Pacha, whose caution would have\r\navoided this catastrophe.\r\n\r\nDined with the East India volunteers. The officers of the regiment are all\r\nclerks in the Company's service. The non-commissioned officers and privates\r\nserve in their warehouses.\r\n\r\nThere are now 600 men. During the war they had three regiments, each 800\r\nstrong--all their own servants.\r\n\r\nWhen my health was drunk I spoke of the Duke of Wellington's natural\r\nfondness for India, of the high terms in which he always mentioned the\r\ngallantry of the Indian army, and the purity of the Civil Service. I said\r\nthe Ministers were animated by his example, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker told me he thought Mr. Stanley [Footnote: A curious instance of\r\nthe failure of political prophecies, even by men of judgment and\r\nexperience. Seventeen years later he was leader of a party, and twenty-\r\nthree years afterwards Prime Minister.] would never rise higher than he was\r\nnow. It had been a curious Session--all men endeavouring to avoid\r\ncommitting themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 16._\r\n\r\nLoch showed me two letters of Sir J. Malcolm, in which he deprecates the\r\nsending of more writers, and says _numbers_ may be diminished, but not\r\n_salaries_, especially in the higher ranks; and if writers are sent they\r\nmust be provided for. I believe he is right. I had already suggested the\r\nnon-appointment of writers this year, and the Chairs seemed to acquiesce--\r\nindeed, to have thought of it themselves.\r\n\r\nRecorder's Report. Before the report Madame de Cayla, the Duchess D'Escars,\r\n&c., were presented to the King. I had some conversation with Rosslyn and\r\nHerries as to the Indian Question. Herries seemed to be afraid of the House\r\nof Commons. Rosslyn a little, too, of public opinion as to the opening of\r\nthe China trade. They both seemed rather hostile to the continuance of the\r\npresent system. I said I considered it to be a settled point that the\r\npatronage of India should be separated from the Government. The necessity\r\nof making that separation led to one great difficulty. The necessity of\r\nremitting home in goods 3,200,000£ led to another difficulty, and to making\r\nthe Government of India, wherever it might be placed, _mercantile_. The\r\nEast India Company would not, and could not, without the monopoly carry on\r\nthe concern.\r\n\r\nNeither Herries nor Rosslyn seemed to admit the necessary separation of the\r\npatronage of India from the Government.\r\n\r\nI said that, if it might not be separated, it would be easy to make a\r\nbetter and a cheaper government. I can see that Peel, Fitzgerald, Herries,\r\nRosslyn--perhaps Sir G. Murray--will be against the Company.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said it was clear to him that the remittances must be made in\r\ngoods, and could not be made by bills. He is for the monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the papers will be printed. A copy will then be furnished to\r\neach member of the Government, and I shall receive their observations.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder's Report was a very heavy one. All the cases bad, and seven\r\nordered for execution.\r\n\r\nThe King seemed very well.\r\n\r\nStratford Canning and Lord Strangford were at the Court, to be presented on\r\ntheir return.\r\n\r\nBefore the report we read the last Irish papers. The Duke of Northumberland\r\nand Lord F. Leveson seem to think rather favourably of the condition of\r\nIreland. The belief of Peel and Goulburn, and, I believe, of the Duke, is\r\nthat _one_ example would settle all.\r\n\r\nLord F. Leveson says that the Brunswickers are encouraged _from St.\r\nJames's_ to expect that the Relief Bill will be repealed. Many wish for an\r\nexplosion, the Catholics less than the Protestants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 19._\r\n\r\nHardinge and Wood dined with me. Hardinge says the Duke of Cumberland has\r\ndetermined not to leave England, but to send for the Duchess and his son.\r\nThe Duchess of Gloucester did not before, and will not now, receive the\r\nDuchess of Cumberland. Old Eldon wants a guarantee that no more Whigs will\r\nbe admitted. I believe he would be satisfied with none but his own\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nHardinge seems to think we may not have a majority when Parliament meets. I\r\nthink he is wrong. I trust to the Duke's fortune and to 'the being a\r\nGovernment,' which is much, and to the others not being able to form a\r\nGovernment, which is more.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 22._\r\n\r\nHad a letter from Loch. He does not like the disbanding of the six\r\nregiments, but he says he brings it before the Court again on Monday,\r\nhaving promised every possible information.\r\n\r\nRead some of Colonel Tod's 'Rajastan.' I had rather see Rajastan or\r\nRajpootana than any part of India. It would really be interesting. Colonel\r\nTod seems to be an enthusiast about the country and the people. He was\r\nthere apparently at least sixteen years. The story of the beautiful\r\nPrincess of Oudeypore [Footnote: Krishna Komari. She was poisoned by her\r\nfather to avoid the hostilities of the rival princes who demanded her hand.\r\nThe father was still living when Colonel Tod wrote. The House of Oudeypore\r\nwas the only native reigning family who disdained to intermarry even with\r\nthe Emperors of Delhi. See Tod's _Rajasthan_, i. 066.] in Tod's book and\r\nSir J. Malcolm's is the most romantic and the most interesting I know. That\r\nfamily of Oudeypore or Mewar seems to be the most ancient in the world. It\r\nfar surpasses the Bourbons and the House of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 23._\r\n\r\nChairs at eleven. Told them of the danger in which they were, from the\r\nfeeling of the mercantile districts and of the country; that we could not\r\nlook Parliament in the face without having done all in our power to effect\r\nreductions in a deficit of 800,000£ a year; that without a commanding case\r\nno Government, however strong, could venture to propose a renewal of the\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThey were obliged to me for my information. I advised them to turn their\r\nattention immediately to all the great points.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the six regiments the Court differ from the view I took.\r\nLoch gave me a long statement of facts, which I must read attentively, and\r\nthen communicate with the Duke.\r\n\r\nThey are so enamoured of old habits that they hesitate about desiring their\r\nIndian Governments and the subordinate correspondents of these Governments\r\nto place upon the back of their voluminous letters a _précis_ of their\r\nsubstance!\r\n\r\nAfter the Chairs were gone I saw Bankes and Leach, and while they were with\r\nme Sir Archibald Campbell called. I saw him immediately. He is a fat,\r\nrather intelligent-looking man, well mannered, and sensible. I talked to\r\nhim of the idea of exchanging Tenasserim. [Footnote: The furthest province\r\nof the British territory towards Siam, extending along the coast south of\r\nPegu, and lately conquered from the Burmese Empire.] He did not like giving\r\nup his conquest. I gave him one secret letter, and he will make his\r\nobservations upon it.\r\n\r\nHe left Lord William at the mouth of the Hooghly. They had found out the\r\nremoval of the Government was contrary to law. They had intended to be\r\nitinerant for a year or two.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the Bengal army that the officers are old. There they rise by\r\nseniority. In the Madras army they are made from fitness.\r\n\r\nThe Madras army, though most gallant, was quite unequal, from deficiency of\r\nphysical strength, to face the Burmese. The Burmese soldiers brought\r\nfourteen days' provisions. All men are liable to be called upon. They never\r\nhad more than 120,000 in the field.\r\n\r\nThe English army took 2,000 cannon, and it was believed the Burmese had\r\n2,500 left.\r\n\r\nSir A. Campbell says there have been 60,000 refugees from Ava--all now\r\nsettled in Tenasserim. I had thought there had never been more than 10,000,\r\nand that some, about half, had returned.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, he seems enamoured of his conquests, but he did not adduce\r\nany good reason against exchanging it.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet room. Saw Lord Rosslyn there, as I used to be last year,\r\n_désoeuvré_ and bored, as all Privy Seals will be. He seemed dissatisfied\r\nwith the state of affairs in Ireland and in England. At Manchester there is\r\na fear of a turn-out of some more cotton-spinners. Every thing depends upon\r\nthe harvest.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with the Turks came to nothing. The Grand Vizier's answer\r\nto Diebitch is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe sickness amongst the Russian troops continues, and Diebitch has not\r\nmore than 40,000 men, even with Roth's corps.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadors have been very well received at Constantinople. All are in\r\ngood humour there, notwithstanding the losses near Shumla.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor does not go to the army.\r\n\r\nLord Heytesbury represents Russia as being the least formidable of the\r\ngreat Powers for the purpose of offensive operations, and seems to think\r\nshe contains many elements of convulsion.\r\n\r\nMetternich is trying to cajole the Russians by pretended fears of\r\nrevolutionary principles.\r\n\r\nThey talk of a King in Columbia, and the French are intriguing to place a\r\nFrench prince on the throne, after Bolivar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 25, 1829._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. The Ambassadors seem to have been received most cordially at\r\nConstantinople. We know no more of the Grand Vizier's losses. That he\r\nexperienced a complete defeat there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn Columbia, the French seem rather inclined to place, after Bolivar, a\r\nPrince of the House of Orleans on the throne, and it does not seem unlikely\r\nthat the Columbians may consider it their best arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia seems to be desirous of Peru, and the King of Prussia\r\nhas, at his request, sent the Baron von Müffling as his Minister to the\r\nPorte to mediate.\r\n\r\nThe Irish accounts are very bad. Lord F. Leveson seems now to think very\r\nseriously of the state of things. Doherty is come back much alarmed from\r\nBarris, where he has been with Blackie on a special commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 28._\r\n\r\nI recommended to the attention of the Chairs the establishment of steam\r\ncommunication with India by the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 29._\r\n\r\nRead _précis_ relative to Kotah.\r\n\r\nThese _précis_ will make me thoroughly acquainted with the history and\r\ncircumstances of the Rajpoot States, which are by far more interesting than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThere is a looseness and a vulgarity in the East India House writing, the\r\nliterature of clerks which is quite disgusting. Our clerks write better\r\nthan theirs, but they do not write concisely and correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 30._\r\n\r\nRead Lord Heytesbury's letters. He is very Russian. They have certainly got\r\nthe plague at Odessa, and in all the stations of the Russian army.\r\n\r\nMet Peel at the Cabinet room. He said Ireland was in rather a better state.\r\nHe agreed with me in thinking the Brunswickers were the cause of all the\r\nmischief. He believed the King had begged the Duke of Cumberland to stay,\r\nand that the Duchess was certainly coming over. They wish to attack the\r\nMinistry through the side of Ireland--to make a civil war rather than not\r\nturn out a Government.\r\n\r\nHe had written to the Duke suggesting that we ought to have a Cabinet\r\nrespecting Ireland, and he thought the Duke would come to town on his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 1._\r\n\r\nHad from Sir G. Murray papers relative to the Canada question, upon which\r\nhe wishes to have the opinion of the Cabinet to-morrow. The immediate\r\nquestion is whether a Bill passed by the Colonial Legislature for altering\r\nthe state of the representation shall be confirmed by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe state of Canada is such that I am convinced we ought in prudence to\r\nplace the revenue collected under the 14th Geo. II. at the disposal of the\r\nChambers, retaining, as they are willing to retain, a fixed salary for the\r\nGovernment judges, independent of the annual vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, August 2._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 4. Irish question. Lord F. Leveson seems to be much alarmed. He\r\nwants to use the Bill of this year for the suppression of an expected\r\nmeeting at Derry, which meeting is to be unarmed, sing songs, drink toasts,\r\nmake speeches, and petition for a change of Ministers.\r\n\r\nIt was considered that the powers entrusted to Government by the Bill for\r\nthe suppression of the Roman Catholic Association were never intended to be\r\nexercised for the putting down of such a meeting as that intended to be\r\nheld at Derry. If the Brunswickers there come out of their houses and have\r\na procession _causing fear_ and threatening the peace, the common law can\r\nput them down. Care will be taken to have troops enough at Derry.\r\n\r\nLord F. Leveson likewise asks whether he shall proclaim martial law! Peel\r\nvery properly asks him what martial law is. In fact it is the absence of\r\nall law--and can only be endured when a country is on the eve of rebellion\r\nor actually in rebellion. [Footnote: This was exactly the description given\r\nof it by Lord Beaconsfield with reference to Jamaica in 1866.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Lord Francis is unequal to his situation. I wish we had\r\nHardinge there. He would never go wrong.\r\n\r\nHerries told me he thought, after reading the papers I had sent him, that\r\nthere was more of care for the Company than he expected.\r\n\r\nPeel has written a very good letter to Lord F. Gower, telling him that the\r\nfirst thing they must do is to establish an _efficient police_, to be paid\r\nfor by Ireland--and of which the officers must be appointed by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 3._\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge. He has perfected a very excellent system in Ireland by which\r\nall the 30,000 pensioners are divided into districts, in each of which is a\r\nchief constable who pays them. If they move from one district to another\r\nthey have a ticket, so that the residence and the movements of all are\r\nknown. Of 30,000 about 10,000 are fit for duty. Blank orders are ready at\r\nthe Castle, directing the march of these men upon five central points,\r\nwhere they would be incorporated with the regiments, so that in a few days\r\nthe army could be reinforced by 10,000 men. There are others who are not\r\nvery capable of doing anything but mischief if against us. These would be\r\nordered to the garrisons.\r\n\r\nI wish Hardinge was in Ireland instead of Lord Francis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 6._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11.\r\n\r\nAstell does not seem to like my letters relative to the delay in answering\r\ndespatches from India and in communicating events in India; and respecting\r\nthe amount of military stores sent to India, and the expediency of\r\nenquiring whether their amount could not be diminished. Loch did not say\r\nanything. It was an attempt at bullying on Astell's part, which I resisted,\r\nand successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 10._\r\n\r\nThe Russians appear to have passed the defiles on the northern side of the\r\nBalkans, and almost without loss. There is, I conclude, a force near\r\nBourgas, but all that is to be hoped is that the Turks will be wise enough\r\nnot to fight. It was an unlucky appointment, that of the Grand Vizier. Old\r\nHussein never would have committed his fault.\r\n\r\nR. Gordon has been magnificently received at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nPolignac has been made Prime Minister of France. De Rigny is made Minister\r\nof Marine. The Government is Tory, and I should think very favourable to\r\nEnglish alliance, not Greek, and certainly not Russian. If it should be\r\nable to stand, it must be good for us. Received letters from Colonel\r\nMacdonald from Tabriz. He says the Russians at Tiflis talk as if they were\r\ngoing to war with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 11._\r\n\r\nReceived Persian despatches. The Persians will pay no more. They wanted to\r\ngo to war. No one would go as Envoy to Petersburg but an _attaché_. They\r\nall thought they should be beheaded. Macdonald seems to have kept them\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Met Lord Melville. Read Gordon's letters from Constantinople.\r\nThe Turks have not above 20,000 men there. They are not disposed to yield\r\nat all. Gordon thinks if we declared we would fix in any manner the limits\r\nof Greece, and maintain them, the Porte would not quarrel with us, and\r\nwould rather do anything than yield the point of honour by acknowledging\r\nthe independence of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Russians mean to pass the Balkans with 60,000 men and march on\r\nAdrianople. They send a large force by sea to Sizeboli to turn Bourgas.\r\n\r\nLord Francis Leveson holds out the apprehension of a long religious contest\r\nin Ireland. [Footnote: Unhappily, like other pessimists, he seems to have\r\njudged Ireland correctly.] I believe he looks only at the surface and\r\njudges from first appearances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 12._\r\n\r\nA victory gained by Paskewitz over the Seraskier, whom he has taken\r\nprisoner, with thirty-one pieces of cannon, &c., near Erzeroum--that is,\r\nthree days after the battle, Paskewitz, still in pursuit, was within forty\r\nmiles of Erzeroum.\r\n\r\nWrote two letters to the Duke--one on the subject of Sir J. P. Grant, who\r\nhas closed the Courts at Bombay because the Government would not execute an\r\nunlawful process, and the other respecting Persian affairs, giving the\r\nsubstance of the despatches which I enclosed.\r\n\r\nWe have a Cabinet to-morrow at 12 on Turkish affairs. I would not allow the\r\nRussians to advance any further. I would send one from our own body,\r\n_incognito,_ to Paris to talk to Polignac and endeavour to get him to join\r\nus in an act of vigorous intervention which would give character to his\r\nGovernment and save Constantinople. I would pass the English and French\r\nfleets through the Dardanelles, and give Russia a leaf out of the Greek\r\nTreaty. But I do not expect that this will be Aberdeen's course.\r\n\r\nDrummond, whom I saw, said the Duke was delighted with the account of the\r\nJaghirdars of the Kistna. Granville is gone to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was gone to Windsor. It is the King's birthday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 13._\r\n\r\nWhen the Cabinet was assembled the Duke said we were not to consider the\r\nstate of things at Constantinople, and what we should do. He thought the\r\nRussians would get to Constantinople, and into it. If they did he thought\r\nthere was an end of the Ottoman Empire. He was doubtful whether, after the\r\ninnovations introduced, the Turks would cordially support Mahmoud,\r\n[Footnote: Sultan Mahmoud, as is well known, remodelled the whole internal\r\norganisation of the Turkish Empire. He was denounced as the Giaour Sultan\r\nby old-fashioned Turks.] and already there were insurrections of the\r\nGreeks. It was just what he predicted in his letter to La Ferronays, and\r\nwhat Lord Dudley afterwards said in a letter to Lièven; the success of the\r\nRussians was the dissolution of an Empire which could not be reconstituted.\r\nIt was too late to interfere by force, even if we had been disposed to do\r\nso alone.\r\n\r\nHe thought France, if we did nothing, would be quiet--if we did anything,\r\nshe would take the other line. Polignac was a more able man than people\r\nsupposed, and he would adhere to the course he adopted. We might endeavour,\r\nat any rate, to ascertain his feelings and intentions.\r\n\r\nAs to the Greek question we must have a conference, and consider the\r\nsuggestions of the Ambassadors, namely, that whatever we chose to make\r\nGreece, should be declared independent, and guaranteed. Both the Duke and\r\nAberdeen thought France and Russia would both take the proposition into\r\nconsideration. The former as to _limits_, the latter for delay. France had\r\nalready told us that, provided we could agree upon the limits, she was\r\ninclined to adopt the suggestion of the Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nWe asked whether the permanent occupation of Constantinople by Russia was\r\nto be submitted to? The answer was, _No_, to be opposed by war. It seemed\r\nto me and to Fitzgerald we had better endeavour to prevent, at a small\r\nexpense, even if alone, a measure we could only retrieve if it took place\r\nat an enormous expense, if at all, and which would in all probability\r\neffect the ruin of the Turkish Empire. I did not think affairs quite so\r\ndesperate. I thought the Russians might get to Adrianople, but not to\r\nConstantinople, and that they could not maintain themselves at Adrianople\r\nwithout the command of the sea. We had six ships at the mouth of the\r\nDardanelles, and these with the Turkish Fleet would open the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nI was for passing our ships up to Constantinople and placing them at the\r\ndisposal of the Ambassador, for from hence we cannot give orders adapted to\r\ncircumstances. It was replied _that_ would be war. If war were to be\r\ndeclared we should do as much mischief as possible, and go to Cronstadt,\r\nnot to the Black Sea. We should have our ships beyond the Bosphorus when\r\nRussia occupied the Dardanelles, and shut us in. This would make us\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nAs the object is not to do mischief to Russia, but to save the Turkish\r\nEmpire, I should say that measure was to be effected at the Bosphorus, for\r\nConstantinople, once taken, and the Ottoman Power annihilated, it would be\r\nof no use to distress Russia.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald seemed to be of my opinion that, however desperate the chance,\r\nwe should do all we could to save Constantinople, and at any risk.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that our fleet in the Mediterranean should be reinforced\r\nby three or four line-of-battle ships, on the principle that wherever any\r\nPower had a large force, we should have one--not a very wise principle, it\r\nseems to me, if we are never to use force. I interceded for a few powerful\r\nsteamers, with 68 pound carronades, and I think Lord Melville seemed\r\ninclined to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nQuestions are to be put to Polignac to ascertain what he would do in\r\ncertain events. I said he never would open himself to Lord Stuart. It was\r\nthen suggested by the Duke that Aberdeen could write a private letter. This\r\nwill, I believe, be done. I said to Fitzgerald, who was next to me,\r\n'Neither letter nor Stuart will get anything out of Polignac. One of\r\nourselves should go to Paris as an individual, see Polignac, and return\r\nbefore the Conference.'\r\n\r\nI suggested Rosslyn, as he had nothing to do. Fitzgerald said he could go\r\nand return in a week, and seemed to wish to do so. However, nothing was\r\nsaid openly; and with all the means of success in our hands, for, I think,\r\nPolignac _might_ be brought into our views, we shall lose all by not using\r\nproper instruments; just as we have lost the Greek question by persisting\r\nin keeping Stratford Canning.\r\n\r\nWe had a good deal of conversation as to the limits of Greece. The Duke was\r\nfor adhering to the Morea. It was _really_ the best line. It was what we\r\nhad guaranteed. We had told the Turks we did not mean to go beyond it.\r\n\r\nAberdeen has always had a little private hankering after Athens, though he\r\nridicules it. He had no scruple about annexing Athens, although not yet\r\ntaken. I said I thought Polignac would be disposed to hold our language to\r\nRussia, if we would make some concession on the subject of Greece, and\r\nenable him to settle that question with _éclat_. He would then be supported\r\nby France in any strong language he might hold, and would establish himself\r\nby the experiment of his first fortnight of office.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Cabinet seems disposed to look at accessories, not at\r\nprinciples, at the minor objects rather than at _the one great object_,\r\nwhich is inducing France to act with us to prevent the occupation of\r\nConstantinople or to force its evacuation. Instead of yielding upon points\r\nof minor importance, in order to carry the question, we are to insist now\r\non the minor points-the evacuation of the Morea by the French, and then, I\r\nfear we shall weaken Polignac's Government, and lose our object.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy has certainly been, most unsuccessful. We have succeeded\r\nin nothing.\r\n\r\nThe communication to be made to Polignac is to be made to him\r\nconfidentially, and he is to know it is not to be made to Austria. It is\r\nconsidered that in any case Austria would support France and England if\r\nthey acted together, and any indication Austria might give of moving alone\r\nwould bring down Prussia upon her. This line, I think, well considered and\r\nprudent.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be thought that, if the Turkish Empire should be _dissolved_,\r\nAustria might be inclined to share the spoils and be quiet; but if it were\r\nonly _weakened_, she would feel she suffered.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be admitted by all that we ought to have taken a decided step\r\nlong ago. That we were too late, and that we were inexcusable.\r\n\r\nI said a year ago Aberdeen would ruin us--he would gradually let us down,\r\nnot by any flagrant error, but by being always under the mark. The Duke,\r\noccupied as he is as Prime Minister, wanted an efficient secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs, and he could not have had a worse.\r\n\r\nPeel seems to think Ireland stands much better since the proclamation\r\nrespecting the attack made by the Ribbonmen upon the Orangemen in\r\nFermanagh. He seems to think the Irish Government ready enough when things\r\nare brought to their notice, but that they do not read or attend to the\r\nreports made to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 19._\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think from what Colonel Hodgson says that leather might be\r\nmade in India as well as here. They have the hide of the buffalo. They want\r\nthe _tanning_, and some one must be sent from this country to teach them.\r\nHe told me of a Mr. Cotton who was long at Tanjore, where the iron is, and\r\nI have written to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 22._\r\n\r\nThe Russians have taken Erzeroum, and have quite dispersed the Turkish army\r\nin Asia. Every success of theirs in that quarter makes my heart bleed. I\r\nconsider it a victory gained over me, as Asia is _mine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 28._\r\n\r\nThe 'Courier' of last night throws doubts on the reported victory of\r\nKirkhilissa. The Sultan is said to be now ready to treat. The plague is in\r\nthe Russian army, and in the country before them. Had a long conversation\r\nwith Hardinge on Indian affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 29._\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Mr. Cartwright, the Consul at Constantinople, dated the\r\n9th. The loss of Erzeroum is to be attributed to the Janizaries. In all\r\nAsia they seem to be rising. The Russians are not expected to advance till\r\nthey are joined by 15,000 men, coming by sea. Thus our fleet would have\r\nsaved Constantinople.\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past three. Before the Cabinet read Lord Heytesbury's and\r\nMr. Gordon's despatches. Lord Heytesbury seems to be a mere Russian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 31._\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon describes the Turkish Empire as falling to pieces. The national\r\nenthusiasm and religious feeling of the people seem to be gone. The Sultan\r\nis unpopular. The populace of Adrianople desires the advance of the\r\nRussians, so scandalous has been the conduct of the Asiatics. The Pacha of\r\nEgypt gives no assistance, and thinks the weakness of the Porte constitutes\r\nhis strength. The people of Trebizond have invited Count Paskewitz.\r\nErzeroum was lost by the treachery of the Janizaries.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has acceded to the Treaty of London. This accession is\r\nqualified, but not in such a manner as to preclude negotiation. He has\r\nconsented to treat with Russia, to give freedom to the navigation of the\r\nBlack Sea, and to observe the Treaty of Akerman--but he stipulates for the\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman dominions in Europe and Asia. He has not, however,\r\nsent Plenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\nGeneral Muffling, the Prussian, is arrived at Constantinople. He reports\r\nthe moderate views of the Emperor Nicholas, and states them.\r\n\r\nThe French Government, from the information it derived from its Minister at\r\nBerlin, has instructed Count Guilleminot to declare to the Turks the terms\r\non which Russia will make peace. Russia requires the execution of the\r\nTreaty of Akerman--indemnity--(but moderate) for the expenses of the war\r\nand the losses sustained by her commerce, for which indemnity, as it seems,\r\nshe is willing to take Anapa.\r\n\r\nShe requires the free navigation of the Dardanelles for all nations. This\r\ncession to be secured by treaty, not by territorial occupation.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Turks are not very dissimilar; but as Count Diebitch has\r\norders to advance till preliminaries are signed, a catastrophe may take\r\nplace still.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon managed to get a paper into the Sultan's own hands, which may\r\nhave led in some measure to this result. He naturally gave credit to the\r\ninformation contained in the Despatches of Count Guilleminot, but the\r\nFrench Government have no authority for their opinion as to the terms on\r\nwhich Russia will make peace. No communication to that effect has been made\r\nofficially to them.\r\n\r\nThe French and Russian Ministers at the Conference said they could not act\r\non Mr. Gordon's letter, which is as yet uncorroborated by Count\r\nGuilleminot. They could not yet act as if Turkey had acceded to the Treaty\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nThe Russians would now declare the independence of Greece within the Gulfs\r\nof Volo and Arta, and they wanted Aberdeen to take that instead of the\r\ntreaty. He thought he could get them to declare the independence of Greece\r\n_within the Morea_--that they would be satisfied with that, and that, if\r\nthey would, we had better secure that for the Turks now, than run the risk\r\nof the event of war and of the extension which might be given to the terms\r\nwhich might be forced upon them under the Treaty of London.\r\n\r\nHowever, even admitting that the Russians would be content with the\r\nindependence of Greece within the Morea (with Attica, [Footnote: Attica was\r\nstill held by the Turks, having been reconquered after its first occupation\r\nby the Greeks.] by-the-bye), it was the opinion of the Duke and of every\r\none (but Aberdeen) that it would neither be generous nor honourable to\r\nforce upon the Turks in their distress terms which _they_, attaching much\r\nvalue to the _suzeraineté_, might think less favourable than what they\r\nmight obtain under the Treaty of London, and that we should be drawing\r\nourselves into the embarrassment of what would be practically a new treaty\r\nat the moment that we were beginning to entertain hopes of getting out of\r\nthat which had so long harassed us.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I think the aspect of Eastern affairs is better than it has\r\nbeen since we have been a Government.\r\n\r\nDiebitch is said to have 35,000 men, and a reserve of 40,000. I doubt the\r\nreserve being so strong. The 15,000 from Sebastopol have joined.\r\n\r\nPaskewitz is made Grand Cross of St. George.\r\n\r\nDiebitch will be so, of course.\r\n\r\nThe King, Peel said, is very blind. He has lost the sight of one eye. The\r\nDuke said when he was at Windsor last, the King was particularly civil to\r\nhim, and Peel and the Duke were both of opinion that the King would be most\r\ncordial with the Government if the Duke of Cumberland were away, and was\r\nnow more so than could be expected under his influence.\r\n\r\nAberdeen seems to have written the letter to Stuart, and Stuart to have\r\ncommunicated it to Prince Polignac. Stuart's idea is that Polignac has had\r\ntoo much to do in fixing himself to think much of foreign politics. He\r\nexpressed himself, however, disposed to consult with England as to the\r\nmeasures which should be adopted if Russia should break her engagements.\r\n\r\nSeveral representations have been made to France for the withdrawing of the\r\nFrench troops from the Morea--but hitherto without effect. These troops\r\nkeep the country quiet, and enable the whole force of the Greek State to\r\nact offensively. Thus, assisted by French and Russian money, the Greeks\r\nhave acquired possession of everything within the Gulfs of Volo and Arta,\r\nexcept the Island of Negropont.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 1, 1829._\r\n\r\nRead with attention a paper of Courtney's on Leach's observations. Wrote\r\nsome memoranda upon it, which I shall send with it to the Duke, when I have\r\ngot from Shepheard a statement of the benefit derived by the territory from\r\nthe fixed rate of exchange. It is a valuable paper. I have written to thank\r\nhim for it, and to ask him to give me the result of his considerations on\r\nthe mode of transferring the Government of India from the Company to the\r\nKing, without materially increasing the patronage of the Crown; and\r\nlikewise the view he takes of the alterations it would be desirable to\r\nintroduce, if the Company should continue to govern India, in the powers of\r\nthe Board of Control and in its relations with the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 3._\r\n\r\nThe Directors are much afraid of the Russians. So am I, and the Russians\r\nbegin to threaten us. They hint that they have open to them the route to\r\nBagdad, and they announce the presence in Petersburg of an Afghan Chief,\r\nand of Ambassadors from Runjeet Singh.\r\n\r\nI feel confident we shall have to fight the Russians on the Indus, and I\r\nhave long had a presentiment that I should meet them there, and gain a\r\ngreat battle. All dreams, but I have had them a long time.\r\n\r\nI have some idea of a secret letter to Bombay, directing the Government to\r\ntake possession of the Island of Karak, [Footnote: A small island in the\r\nPersian Gulf to the north-west of Bushire.] and of any other tenable point\r\nto seal the Euphrates, in the event of the Russians moving down.\r\n\r\nLoch wants to dethrone Runjeet Singh!\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 4, 1829._\r\n\r\nSaw Colonel Willoughby Cotton, who commanded _en second_ in Ava. He has\r\nlately visited, as Adjutant-General of King's troops, all the stations of\r\nthe army in Bengal. He says no army can be in finer order. Lord Combermere\r\nhas weeded all the old men. The regiments manoeuvre beautifully.\r\n\r\nLord C. wishes to have two King's regiments cantoned under the Himalaya\r\nMountains, where the climate is as good as in England.\r\n\r\nRunjeet Singh has conquered Cabul and Cashmere. He has French officers at\r\nthe head of his infantry and cavalry, and about five others. His artillery\r\nhe keeps under his own family. He has of regular troops 30,000 infantry,\r\nand 10,000 cavalry, about eighty guns. All these easily assembled near the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nHe is old, and when he dies his two sons are likely to quarrel and call us\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe two ex-Kings of Cabul are living at Ludeana on pensions. Zemaun Shah,\r\nthe blind King, and his brother, who was King in Mr. Elphinstone's time.\r\n\r\nColonel Cotton speaks most highly of the Madras troops. They are more\r\ndisposable than the Bengal troops, more free from prejudice of caste.\r\n\r\nHe regrets the reduction of the bodyguard which conducted itself nobly in\r\nAva. I like a guard, and I would have an infantry as well as a cavalry\r\nguard, to be formed by picked men.\r\n\r\nColonel Willoughby Cotton says Colonel Skinner is about 55. His son is a\r\nmerchant, and goes every year into Cashmere for shawls. Skinner has still\r\nabout 1,300 men, and is quartered not far from Delhi. His people fire the\r\nmatchlock over the arm at full gallop, and with correct aim. They strike a\r\ntent-peg out of the ground with their lances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 5._\r\n\r\nReceived an answer from the Duke. He thinks the question of the six\r\nregiments begins to be serious, as the Court throw upon the Government the\r\nresponsibility of running the risk of a mutiny in the army--desires to see\r\nthe paper, which I have sent him, and says it must go to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nI feel satisfied I am right. If the Cabinet give in to the Court, they\r\nweaken my hands so much that I shall be unable to effect any great reform.\r\nThey make the Directors the real Ministers of India, and almost emancipate\r\nthe Indian Government. So I told the Duke in my letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 7._\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Sir A. Campbell. He came to offer himself for a command in\r\nIndia. I spoke to him of his papers respecting war with the Burmese. He\r\nsays large boats carrying 100 men could go up to Aeng, the troops need not\r\nland at Ramree. He was never an advocate for a diversion at Rangoon, and\r\nthinks they make too much fuss about the frontier of Munnipore.\r\n\r\nSaw a Mr. Cotton, for a long time collector of Tanjore. He is against\r\nintroducing the Ryotwaree settlement into that country, and by his account\r\nit seems very ill adapted to it, for according to him the Murassidars are\r\nthere really proprietors, and with them the settlement is now made for the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nI sent for him to tell me about the iron I had understood to be in the\r\nneighbourhood of Tanjore; but there is none, it is at Satara. He seems a\r\nsensible man, and I must see him again.\r\n\r\nThe Turks seem to have endeavoured to back out of their accession to the\r\nTreaty of London, or rather to clog it with insuperable objections. But Mr.\r\nGordon has brought them back again, and on August 12 all was right, but no\r\nPlenipotentiaries sent. The Russians were said to be moving on Adrianople.\r\nThey had not above 35,000 men. There is a very bad account from Smyrna of\r\nthe state of the population in Asia. In fact the Duke of Wellington's\r\nprediction is fulfilled. The Turkish Empire is breaking to pieces. By Lord\r\nHeytesbury's account the Russians are very desirous of peace, and very\r\napprehensive that a popular tumult may put an end to the Sultan. It is\r\nimpossible to see the end of the calamities which would occur, complicated\r\nas they would be, if such an event as the dissolution of the Turkish Empire\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nThe new French Ministry is changing the municipalities. They hope to\r\nsucceed at the next elections. Lord Stuart considers M. de la Bourdonnaye\r\nas the real head.\r\n\r\nPolignac very prudently rests on his oars as to Greece, and properly\r\nobserves it is idle to make protocols here when the march of events may\r\nhave altogether changed the state of things before the protocols arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 8._\r\n\r\nOffice at 11. Went to the Duke. He read to me a long letter he had written\r\non the question of the six regiments, in which he entered at length into\r\nthe state of the Indian army such as he knows it to be, and concludes in\r\nfavour of a revision of the line I had adopted with his approbation. He\r\nsaid the Government of India was wrong--every line of the proposed letter\r\nabstractedly right; but there was to be considered the expediency of\r\nwriting it.\r\n\r\nI have written a letter to Lord W. Bentinck, stating confidentially the\r\ngrounds of the change of opinion as to the disbanding of the six extra\r\nregiments. I added, 'However, such an event will not happen in your time,\r\nnor I hope in mine,' or something to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 11._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. Read to them the Duke's letter on the six regiments. Told\r\nthem I had written a private letter to Lord William to relieve his mind\r\nfrom the censure intended for former Governments (a very small portion of\r\nwhich is chargeable on him), and to caution him against similar errors.\r\nGave them the alteration I had intended to make in the draft respecting\r\npensions granted to King's soldiers enlisted into their army. They will\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 14._\r\n\r\nRead the papers containing the correspondence with the local Governments\r\nrespecting the provision of stores in India. It is hardly credible, yet it\r\nis true, that till within these few years the Medical Board indented upon\r\nEngland for drugs which were produced in India! From Madras as late at 1827\r\nthey indented for file handles and blacksmiths' tongs! From Bombay in 1826\r\nfor wooden canteens and triangles! It is evident the local Governments have\r\nnever displayed any energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 16._\r\n\r\nReceived from the Duke his ideas on the subject of a campaign against Ava.\r\nHe would hold the great Dagon Temple at Rangoon, but only for the purpose\r\nof having vessels in the river to co-operate with the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 17._\r\n\r\nTo-day has been an idle day. I have done nothing; but I have taken\r\nexercise, and so acquired _health_, without which I cannot do business.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 20._\r\n\r\nMet Mr. Conyngham of the Foreign Office. He told me the Turks were ready to\r\nmake the required concessions. Of the disposition of the Russians nothing\r\nseems known. R. Gordon has of his own authority ordered up Sir Pulteney\r\nMalcolm from Vourla to the Dardanelles. I suppose to carry away Englishmen\r\nand their property in the event of an insurrection or of some terrible\r\ncatastrophe at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nLord Stuart, as I suspected, gives no opinion as to the probable result of\r\nthe political contest in France.\r\n\r\nI had a letter from the Duke respecting half-Batta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 24._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Read all the letters from Petersburg, Paris, Berlin, and\r\nConstantinople during the last fortnight, and the despatches sent during\r\nthe last month.\r\n\r\nR. Gordon seems to have done very well. He and Guilleminot have acted\r\ncordially together, and when they had induced the Porte to consent to make\r\npeace on the terms prescribed by the Russians, Gordon managed very\r\nprudently to get General Muffling to send his secretary to the Russian\r\nhead-quarters with the Turkish Plenipotentiaries. Muffling would have gone\r\nwith them to the Reis Effendi had he been well enough; as it was, he sent\r\nhis secretary, who afterwards went to the Russian head-quarters and was\r\nthus enabled to state distinctly what had passed in the conference held\r\nwith the Effendi. I think it very possible that without the intervention of\r\nthe Prussian Minister, who was known to be acquainted with the feelings of\r\nthe Emperor, General Diebitch would not have agreed to an armistice. The\r\narmistice seems to have been made on August 29. We know of it from Seymour\r\nat Berlin.\r\n\r\nPolignac seems excellently well disposed. He would act cordially with us if\r\nhe dared. At present he is obliged to cover all he does under the\r\ninstructions given to Guilleminot by his predecessor under a different\r\nstate of things, before the great Russian successes. He talks of a Congress\r\nof the Powers interested, and of a joint declaration if Russia should not\r\nadhere to her promise.\r\n\r\nRussia may be kept to her promises by the fear of a revolutionary movement\r\nin France. The French Opposition desire the success of the Russians, the\r\ndissolution of the Turkish Empire, and the occupation of the Dardanelles by\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas, because they know that such events would lead to a\r\n_sotto sopra_ in Europe, a general scramble in which they would get the\r\nRhine as their boundary. Generally, I have no doubt, young France wishes\r\nfor confusion.\r\n\r\nAustria is alarmed and would do nothing. The Prussians hold that the\r\nexistence of the Ottoman Empire is not essential to the balance of power\r\n(that is, some of them do), and they would be glad to see Austria and\r\nRussia divide Turkey, Prussia having her compensation in Germany. However,\r\nMuffling, going rather beyond his instructions, has been made to do good.\r\n\r\nI think all things tend to the preservation of peace if there should be no\r\nexplosion at Constantinople or in France. The Ottoman Empire seems,\r\nhowever, to be falling to pieces. The Government has been so oppressive\r\nthat the people will not fight for it. The Sultan has but 4,000 troops, and\r\nit is said the appearance of 10,000 Russians would lead to the capture of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nDiebitch seems to dread the catastrophe which might ensue, and the\r\nambassadors have placed before him in strong terms the fatal consequences\r\nof an explosion at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nI must say R. Gordon has done ably and well.\r\n\r\nThe rascally Russians have been intriguing with our Ionian subjects, and\r\nAberdeen has written a very strong letter to Lord Heytesbury on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nPolignac, desirous as he is of withdrawing the French troops altogether\r\nfrom the Morea, is at present afraid of doing so.\r\n\r\nAberdeen told me things were not going on well here. The King has quite\r\nlost the sight of one eye, and the sight of the other is indistinct. It\r\ngives him pain, too, and the fear of blindness makes him nervous. The Duke\r\nof Cumberland is always about him, as mischievous as ever, but pretending\r\nnot to be hostile.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington gives the King up as a bad job. He sees him very\r\nseldom. At first he liked seeing him and setting things to rights; but he\r\nsays he found what he did one day was undone the next, and he is in\r\ndespair. The King has no constancy. There is no depending upon him from one\r\nday to another.\r\n\r\nAberdeen says the accession of Rosslyn has not produced the effect we\r\nanticipated--that Lord Grey is very hostile. What we shall do for a\r\nmajority next session I know not, but I think we shall stand, [Footnote:\r\nThis might have been but for the events on the Continent in the year\r\nfollowing, which formed a new starting-point in the politics of a large\r\npart of Europe.] although we shall not, I fear, be a strong Government. The\r\nCatholic Relief Bill has destroyed our unity and the spirit of party. It\r\nhas likewise destroyed that of the Opposition, who have no longer any\r\nrallying point. Thus the formation of a strong Government is difficult. The\r\nBrunswickers cannot form one, and the King cannot be persuaded to make one\r\nout of the Opposition. Indeed, that the Duke of Cumberland would never\r\nadvise. The Brunswickers will endeavour to make terms with us as a body--to\r\nmake martyrs of some of the old Protestants, particularly of the Duke and\r\nPeel, and placing themselves at the head to go on as well as they could\r\nwith the rest of us. This will not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 26._\r\n\r\nThe Chairs, or rather the Court, somewhat impertinently object to the\r\naddition I made to a recent draft, recommending an enquiry by practical and\r\nscientific men as to the powers India may possess of producing many\r\narticles of stores now sent from England. They say this is liable to\r\nmisconstruction, and then misconstrue it themselves. They suppose these\r\npractical men, not being servants of the Company, to sit in judgment upon\r\nthe proceedings of the military Board. I have corrected their intentional\r\nmisconstruction, and have acquiesced in the substitution of a draft they\r\npropose to send instead, which will, I hope, practically effect my object,\r\nand therefore I have said we are willing our object should be attained in\r\nthe manner most agreeable to the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nIt is very lucky I had just sent them my letter about stores. It will\r\nappear to be written subsequently to theirs. They think to humbug and to\r\nbully me. They will find both difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 30._\r\n\r\nRead the collection respecting the health of the King's troops. It is\r\nincredible to me that so many things should remain to be done--nothing\r\nseems to have been done that ought to have been done. I fear our finances\r\nmake the building of new barracks impossible at present. We could not build\r\nproper barracks for all the European troops in India much under a million.\r\nStill much may be done for their health.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 5._\r\n\r\nArrived in London at 3. To the Cabinet room, where I found Lord Bathurst,\r\ncome up to town for Seymour Bathurst's [Footnote: Hon. Seymour Bathurst,\r\nfourth son of third Earl Bathurst, married October 6, 1829, Julia, daughter\r\nof John Peter Hankey, Esq.] marriage, and afterwards Fitzgerald came in.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald was a fortnight in Ireland, and gives a bad account of it.\r\n\r\nA letter from Metternich says peace was actually signed. Sir E. Gordon's\r\ndespatches give every reason to expect it soon would be. The peace cannot\r\nlast. I am inclined to think it would have been better for the Russians to\r\nhave occupied Constantinople, and for the Ottoman Empire to have been\r\noverthrown that we might have known at once where we were, than to have had\r\nsuch a peace as this. It is practically present occupation (for a year) of\r\n_more_ than they now hold, for they are to have the fortresses ceded to\r\nthem. They exact 750,000£ for the pretended losses of their merchants, and\r\nfive millions for themselves. The indemnity to the merchants to be paid by\r\nthree instalments. On the payment of the first, Adrianople and a few places\r\non the coast to be given up. On the payment of the second everything to the\r\nBalkan, and on the third Bulgaria. These payments occupy a year.\r\n\r\nThe five millions are to be paid in ten years, or sooner if the Turks can\r\nmanage it. The Principalities to be occupied till the payment. The Turks to\r\nconfirm the Government established during the ten years, and not to impose\r\nany taxes for two years more.\r\n\r\nAll the fortresses on the left bank to be destroyed. None of the islands to\r\nbelong to Turkey. No Turk to enter the principalities. The princes to be\r\nfor life. All payments _in kind_ from the Principalities to cease, and\r\ninstead the Turks and the princes to _agree upon a compensation_! It is\r\nunnecessary to go through the other articles relative to the\r\nPrincipalities. The treaty contains a real cession of them to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe terms as to the navigation of merchantmen, their not being searched in\r\na Turkish port, the refusal of acquiescence in the demands of the Russian\r\nMinister where any injury is pretended to have been done to a Russian, to\r\nbe _just ground for reprisal_, &c., are of a nature intolerable to an\r\nindependent Power, and not to be carried into execution.\r\n\r\nOn the side of Asia everything is ceded that can enable Russia to attack\r\neither Turkey or Persia with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe terms imposed with regard to indemnities are extravagant and altogether\r\ncontrary to all the Emperor's promises. He has not deceived us; but he has\r\nlied to us most foully. Sir R. Gordon seems to have done all that could be\r\ndone. Perhaps he has saved Constantinople from conflagration, and the\r\nEmpire from dissolution. He has managed to settle the Greek question,\r\nTurkey consenting to everything the allies may determine under the protocol\r\nof March 22. Sir R. Gordon has taken upon himself to order up the English\r\nships, and Guilleminot has ordered up the French ships, but they were still\r\nat Smyrna when the dispatch came away. These ships, it is hoped, may be\r\nsome check on the Russians, and ostensibly they only go up to\r\nConstantinople to save Christians. However, if the Russians advance they\r\nwill probably lead the Turks to fight. Gordon and Guilleminot have very\r\nproperly told the Sultan they will remain by him in any case.\r\n\r\nThe Turks declare the terms are, as regards payment, such as they have\r\nreally no means of complying with. The allies will make representations to\r\nPetersburg to obtain a relaxation of these conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while this was doing at Constantinople, Lord Heytesbury\r\nwas asking Nesselrode what the terms he intended to propose were, and\r\nNesselrode would not tell him. Lord Heytesbury's despatch and Gordon's are\r\nboth dated on September 10. The 12th was to be the day of signature. Lord\r\nStuart by Aberdeen's directions has been pressing Polignac very hard to\r\nwithdraw the French troops from the Morea, and Polignac has been obliged to\r\nplead the weakness of his Government, and to put off Lord Stuart by\r\nreferring it to the Conference. I should say from what the papers show of\r\nPolignac that he will not stand. I do not know what his antagonists may be,\r\nbut he is evidently not a powerful man.\r\n\r\nA Liberal told Fitzgerald their object was now in France to make the King\r\nof the Netherlands King of France, and give Holland to Prussia, taking\r\nBelgium and everything to the Rhine to themselves.\r\n\r\nI should say things looked ill everywhere, and unless we can make the\r\nEmperor of Russia fear a convulsion in France, and determine to recede from\r\nsome of his stipulations with Turkey to satisfy the rest of Europe, we\r\nshall have war, and war under the most unfavourable circumstances--that is,\r\nif Austria be not as pusillanimous as she may be weak, for she ought never\r\nto consent to the establishment of the Russians on the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe only line for the Turks to pursue is to promise everything; to\r\nendeavour to perform everything, and to withdraw to Asia, leaving the rest\r\nof Europe to settle who shall have Constantinople. _Now_ they could not do\r\nthat, as they are too weak; but six months hence they may.\r\n\r\nWe dine with the Duke on Wednesday--and shall then, I suppose, determine\r\nwhat we are to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 7._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. All present except Lord Melville.\r\n\r\nAberdeen read a paper he had written before the peace was known, the object\r\nof which was to show that the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, and that it\r\ncould not be reconstituted; that our views with regard to Greece should now\r\nchange with circumstances, and that we should endeavour to make it a\r\nsubstantive state. To Turkey it could no longer signify whether Greece had\r\na more extended or more limited line of frontier, and our desire should be\r\nto place a fit man upon the throne. France is willing to propose in the\r\nConference that to Turkey should be offered the alternative of a Greece\r\nwith extended limits under Suzeraineté, &c., according to the Protocol of\r\nMarch 22, or a Greece with narrower limits, entirely independent.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said we must first have satisfaction for the insertion of the\r\nArticle in the treaty of peace which bound Turkey to the Protocol of March\r\n22; Russia, as a party to the Treaty of London, having no right to settle\r\nthat treaty herself. Next, we should insist on an armistice between the\r\nGreeks and Turks.\r\n\r\nWe must recollect that Turkey had bound herself to acquiesce in the\r\ndecision of the Conference upon the Greek Treaty--that is, to defer to our\r\nmediation. Could we, as mediators, propose to Turkey to cede Attica,\r\nNegropont, and other possessions she now holds? and would we willingly\r\nbring the frontiers of the Greek state into contact with our Ionian\r\nIslands?\r\n\r\nIf Greece were to have a sovereign, Prince Philip of Hesse Homburg would be\r\nthe best man for us--Austria would prefer him. France admitted that the\r\nwishes of Austria ought to be consulted.\r\n\r\nFrance, however, rather wished for Prince Charles of Bavaria. Russia for a\r\nDuke of Saxe-Weimar.\r\n\r\nAberdeen seemed to think there would be no great difficulty in carrying our\r\npoint, and having Prince Philip of Hesse Homburg.\r\n\r\nPeel said he thought we could not allow a treaty such as that signed by\r\nTurkey to pass without a remonstrance on our part. We referred to a letter\r\nof Dudley's, and to Aberdeen's recent instruction to Lord Heytesbury, and\r\nlikewise to the various declarations of moderation put forth by the Emperor\r\nNicholas. Several ways were started of expressing our opinion--a sort of\r\ncircular to the Powers which signed the Treaty of the Congress--a\r\ndeclaration to Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Duke suggested a remonstrance to the Emperor Nicholas to be\r\ncommunicated in the first instance only to Russia.\r\n\r\nThis seems likely to be adopted, but we are to have another Cabinet to-\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nIn whatever we do we must endeavour to keep Austria out of the scrape, for\r\nthere is nothing the Russians would like so much as the opportunity of\r\nmarching to Vienna.\r\n\r\nNot only it would be romantic for us alone to go to war to maintain the\r\nbalance of power, but it would, in this case, be absurd indeed, for, if our\r\narmies had driven the Russians out of Turkey, we could not reconstitute the\r\nTurkish Empire. It is dissolved in its own weakness.\r\n\r\nGreat dissatisfaction was expressed, and justly, at the conduct of Lord\r\nHeytesbury, who has been humbugged by the Russians all along.\r\n\r\nThe King has run up a bill of 4,000£ for clothes in six months. All the\r\noffices of the Household, except the Chamberlain's, which has 1,900£ in\r\nhand, are falling into arrear, and if there should be an arrear upon the\r\nwhole civil list, it must come before Parliament.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald gives a very bad account of trade generally.\r\n\r\nThe King does not like us better than he did, and the Duke of Cumberland\r\nmeans to keep his son in England, and educate him here, taking the 6,000£ a\r\nyear. He wants to drive the Government to make him Viceroy of Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet dined with the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 8._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. A great deal of conversation of which the result was that a\r\nremonstrance should be made to Russia on the subject of the terms of the\r\npeace. This remonstrance will temperately but strongly, more by statement\r\nof facts than by observations, show that the peace is not such as the\r\nEmperor had given us reason to expect he would require, and that it in\r\nreality threatens the existence of the Turkish Empire; that the destruction\r\nof that Empire would seriously affect the peace of Europe by changing the\r\nrelative position of the several States.\r\n\r\nAberdeen wants a guarantee of the territorial possessions of Turkey, not of\r\nits Government. [Footnote: It is observable that this guarantee seems to\r\nhave said nothing of the internal system of government, and so far to have\r\nbeen unconditional. It would therefore have gone considerably beyond the\r\nAnglo-Turkish Convention of 1878. It would also have applied to Europe as\r\nwell as Asia. It is a commentary on the statement of Mr. Gladstone, in\r\nlater days a colleague of Lord Aberdeen, that no statesman whom he had\r\nknown in former times would ever have listened to the idea of such an\r\nengagement.] I think no one seems much inclined to agree with him. Such a\r\nguarantee would impose obligations without conferring rights upon us. It\r\nwould be a guarantee which would give rise to infinite complications, and\r\nwhich would embarrass us very much.\r\n\r\nWithout a guarantee we may succeed in bringing the great States to an\r\nunderstanding that the distribution of the Turkish territories, in the\r\nevent of the falling to pieces of that State, must be a subject for the\r\ndecision of a Congress.\r\n\r\nAustria has expressed herself very frankly. She is ready to do anything.\r\nShe sees the danger and desires to know our view of it. The real view of\r\nFrance does not seem to be very different; but there is no dependence to be\r\nplaced upon a Government trembling for its life. Prussia will be satisfied\r\nwith the peace. Her sovereign is very weak, and the Prussians think their\r\ninterest is served by the progress of Russia in a direction contrary to\r\nthem, and in which she menaces Austria.\r\n\r\nThe smuggling case is said to tell against Lord Stuart. He writes\r\nunintelligibly, and the French will not trust him--so I shall not be sorry\r\nif we can get rid of him.\r\n\r\nWith Lord Heytesbury we are all dissatisfied, and have been from the\r\nbeginning. There is a Council on Monday, and we have a Cabinet on Sunday at\r\n3, when we are to hear Aberdeen's letter, and may probably have the Treaty.\r\n\r\nThere seems a determination to effect an armistice by force if the\r\nConference will not order it in Greece.\r\n\r\nWe have nine good ships there. The Russians seven bad ones, and the French\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nBefore the Conference can proceed the 10th Article of the Treaty of Peace\r\nmust be declared _non avenu_--that which obliges the Porte to accept the\r\nProtocol of March 22--all negotiation upon that Protocol having been\r\ncommitted by Russia to the French and English Ambassadors, and it having\r\nbeen expressly reserved to the Porte by us, that her objections should be\r\nfairly weighed.\r\n\r\nThe French have taken advantage of the peace to order their troops home\r\nfrom the Morea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 9._\r\n\r\nRead many of the Protocols of the early Conferences after the Russian,\r\ndeclaration of war. I shall to-morrow read these again carefully and sketch\r\n_my_ State paper.\r\n\r\nIf I was in opposition I should describe the details relative to the\r\nPrincipalities, as showing the moderation of the thief who would stipulate\r\nthat men should sleep with their doors open, till they have ransomed\r\nthemselves by paying their uttermost farthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 10._\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Sir J. Malcolm. He seems pleased with the secret\r\ndispatches relative to Persia and the Pacha of Bagdad. He seems upon the\r\nwhole very much gratified, and very grateful.\r\n\r\nHe strongly presses the appointment of an Indian as his successor, and\r\nmentions Sir Ch. Metcalfe and Jenkins. He likewise mentions a Mr. Chaplin,\r\nof whom I never heard. I take Jenkins to be a cleverer man than Sir Ch.\r\nMetcalfe, [Footnote: Afterwards Lord Metcalfe.] who rather disappoints me.\r\n\r\nHad three letters by Petersburg from Colonel McDonald, the last dated in\r\nAugust. The Persians, thoroughly alarmed, are doing all they can to satisfy\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas by punishing the persons engaged in the massacre of\r\nthe Russian mission; but they had an insurrection to quell on banishing the\r\nHigh Priest, who was at the head of all. As they conclude all the bad\r\ncharacters had a hand in it they mean to take the opportunity of punishing\r\nthem. Paskewitz is said to have from 20,000 to 22,000 men--to have\r\nsustained no loss in the late engagements, but to suffer from the plague.\r\nAt Erzeroum the Mahometans are not only satisfied, but well pleased. The\r\nGovernment of a Russian general is better than that of a Turkish Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Abbas Mirza is at last doing something towards making an army.\r\nMajor Hart, alone, however, keeps it together. The troops are as yet ill-\r\narmed, but they have their pay. McDonald thinks the King not likely to live\r\nlong. He wants a cypher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 11, Sunday._\r\n\r\nCame up from Worthing to a Cabinet. Before we met read the last letters\r\nfrom Lord Heytesbury, which show a degree of infatuation respecting the\r\nRussians, which is quite wonderful.\r\n\r\nBefore we began to talk Rothschild called out the Duke of Wellington, and\r\noffered at once all the money to pay the Russian Indemnity. He said he only\r\nwanted the guarantee of England!\r\n\r\nIf the Russians remained in the Principalities there would be a general\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIrvine, an English loan jobber, saw the Duke yesterday with the same offer.\r\n\r\nThe joke is that Rothschild is to pay the money for the Turks, and to be\r\nmade King of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAberdeen began by begging we would first settle the Greek question. He\r\nbrought a paper the Russians were willing to deliver in containing a sort\r\nof apology for the 10th Article, and declaring that it by no means\r\ninterfered with the powers of the Conference. We took a great deal of time\r\nin considering whether we should not suggest some alteration in this\r\npaper--some is to be proposed--not very essential.\r\n\r\nWe had a long discussion as to the name of the new State. At last it seemed\r\nto be thought 'Sovereign Prince of Greece' was the best. Aberdeen thinks\r\nhe shall have little difficulty about the Prince. The Russians agree to the\r\ndescription given; but I dare say they imagine we mean to describe a\r\ndifferent man. I suspect they think we want to give them Leopold.\r\n\r\nAberdeen read a letter he proposed sending to Lord Stuart, the purport of\r\nwhich was that we wanted to know what he meant to do towards redeeming\r\nFrance from the responsibility she had incurred and made us incur by giving\r\ninstructions to Count Guilleminot, stating the terms of peace and the\r\nmoderation of the Emperor--instructions which misled our Ambassador, and\r\ninduced the two Ambassadors to give assurances to the Porte which events\r\nproved to be unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe letter, I think, likewise desired him to enquire in what form our joint\r\nrepresentations as to the amount of the indemnity were to be made. To these\r\nthe Ambassadors have pledged the two Cabinets.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal more in the letter which is to be left out. It went\r\ninto the details of the treaty, or rather of its effects.\r\n\r\nThe offer is to be made to the Turks of an independent Greece, from the\r\nGulf of Volo to Missolonghi, or of a Greece under Suzeraineté, with\r\nNegropont, and the line from Volo to the Gulf of Arta.\r\n\r\nI think we are all agreed that at the commencement of the war it was our\r\ninterest to take as little as possible from Turkey--that now it is our\r\ninterest to make Greece a substantive State, which may hereafter receive\r\nthe _débris_ of the Ottoman Empire. [Footnote: This may explain the\r\napparently illiberal views of many of the Cabinet as to the Greek\r\nboundaries. They saw the difficulty of any halting place outside the\r\nIsthmus of Corinth, short of a wider boundary even than that ultimately\r\nadopted.]\r\n\r\nAs to the really important matter, the remonstrance to Russia, nothing was\r\ndone. Nothing is, I conclude, written, and Aberdeen does not like Cabinet\r\ncriticism, nor do I think the Cabinet at all agreed as to what should be\r\nsaid. Dudley's letters used to occupy us for days, and certainly they were\r\nthe better for it--although we lost a good deal of time occasionally.\r\n\r\nAberdeen said he would send it to me. I think I shall write an _esquisse_\r\nmyself. We are to have no more Cabinets for some time. The Chancellor\r\nwishes to have the remaining fortnight of his holidays uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 12._\r\n\r\nWent to town at quarter-past one. To the Foreign Office. The treaty arrived\r\nlast night. Lord Aberdeen took it with him to Windsor. It differs\r\nmaterially from the _projet_. The Articles respecting indemnity are\r\n_relégués_ to a separate transaction. The payment of 100,000 ducats is to\r\nlead to the evacuation of Adrianople; 400,000 form the next payment, then\r\n500,000, and 500,000, making the sum originally demanded for individual\r\nlosses; but, as I understand Mr. Backhouse, eighteen months must elapse\r\nbefore Turkey can be evacuated to the Danube. I had much conversation with\r\nhim as to other points. On looking into the Act of the Congress I find the\r\nPowers adhering to it may be considered as binding themselves not to\r\n_disturb_ the territorial arrangements that Act establishes; but they are\r\nnot bound to _maintain_ them. Thus if France appropriated to herself Spain,\r\nshe would violate the treaty, but no Power signing the treaty would be\r\nobliged, by virtue of that Act, to make war upon France for doing so.\r\n\r\nThat the general treaty contains no guarantee is evident from the specific\r\nguarantee of the cessions made by Saxony to Prussia, which would have been\r\nunnecessary if the spirit of the treaty had been that of existent\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 13._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Found Lord Rosslyn there. Read the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe King was very well yesterday. The Recorder's Report was so long that\r\nhalf was deferred.\r\n\r\nThe last dispatches from Persia, which arrived on Friday, were opened at\r\nthe Foreign Office, and read by everybody. Aberdeen sent them to the Duke,\r\nwho has probably taken them to Walmer in his carriage. The Chairs sent for\r\nthem, and could not get them. I must put a stop to this. I have written to\r\nLord Heytesbury to beg he will in future forward letters to their address.\r\n\r\nWrote a 'proposed draft' to Lord Heytesbury, directing him, if he should\r\nhave reason to think the Russians intend to exact further concession from\r\nPersia, to intimate that such an attempt will be considered by his Majesty\r\nas unfriendly to himself as an Asiatic Power. I doubt my getting the Duke\r\nto agree to the sending of this despatch; but I shall try.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 14._\r\n\r\nCarried my proposed letter to Lord Heytesbury to Aberdeen, who agrees to\r\nsend it with a trifling alteration, at least one not very important. Read\r\nto him my proposed letter to Lord Heytesbury on the Peace of Adrianople. He\r\nseemed to approve of great part of it. He has done nothing at his yet, and\r\nseems to think there is no hurry!\r\n\r\nWe shall stand very ill in Parliament if we have nothing to show. I think\r\nmine is a good _cadre_ of a letter, but that specific instructions should\r\nbe given to Lord Heytesbury as to what he shall endeavour to obtain in a\r\nseparate despatch.\r\n\r\nRead my drafts to Lord Rosslyn after dinner. He seemed to think the view I\r\ntook was the right, and that much of what I had written was very good, but\r\nthat it might be shortened. So I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 15._\r\n\r\nHenry copied the draft to Lord Heytesbury, for the Duke, to whom I sent it\r\nwith a letter.\r\n\r\nShowed the Chairs the draft to Lord Heytesbury on Persia. They were much\r\npleased with it. So was old Jones. Sent it to the Duke. In little doubt his\r\napproving it.\r\n\r\nReceived from the Duke the Persian despatches which I gave to the Chairs.\r\nThe Duke had not read them.\r\n\r\nReceived from him a letter on the subject of half-Batta. He says as an\r\nofficer he should have thought there was a compromise in 1801. That it\r\nshould be looked into as a question of economy. That above all things in\r\ndealing with an army you must _be just_.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks the publication of the letter of Lord Combermere's\r\nsecretary indiscreet and _wicked_, and is very angry with Lord Combermere.\r\n\r\nA letter will be written to the Government on the subject, directing\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 19, Sunday._\r\n\r\nRead McDonald's despatches from Persia, and sent them to the Duke, with a\r\nletter suggesting the heads of a letter to the Envoy.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have given up one of the two crores due, and allow five years\r\nfor paying the other. They mean, therefore, to rule Persia _by influence_.\r\nHowever, there is a good Mahometan and Anti-Russian feeling beyond the\r\nEuphrates, and if mischief happens, it is our fault.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Hardinge respecting half-Batta. He is for standing\r\nfirm and giving some general boon, as an addition to marching money, to the\r\nwhole army. That is my idea. I am sure it is the safest course.\r\n\r\nWrote to Loch, suggesting it, and at the same time advised him to answer\r\nthe paragraphs respecting half-Batta, and not give misrepresentations too\r\nmuch head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 20._\r\n\r\nTwo letters from the Duke, written very hastily. It is evident he did not\r\nlike my making a sketch of a letter to Lord Heytesbury, and that he does\r\nnot like any difference of opinion as to the Batta question.\r\n\r\nOn the first point I still think I was right. He mentions some ideas of\r\nRussia ordering Diebitch across the Balkan, and even the Danube, of her\r\ngiving up the Principalities, &c. In short he says all we know is that\r\nthere is a peace--we do not know what it is--and it would be ridiculous to\r\nremonstrate against we know not what.\r\n\r\nMy draft was written before these reports were spread; and I only, from\r\nanxiety to have the despatch well written and soon, sketched what I thought\r\nwould do.\r\n\r\nAs to the reports, I have told Aberdeen I cannot believe Russia has on a\r\nsudden ceased to be ambitious, or to use perfidy as a mode of accomplishing\r\nambitious ends. She may give out she will make these changes--she may make\r\nsome--but her object is to prevent all combination on the part of Austria,\r\nFrance, and England. If we do not remonstrate against what is signed, we\r\nshall lose all credit, if that which is executed should be comparatively\r\nfavourable, and we shall incur great blame if no relaxation takes place. A\r\nremonstrance might be so worded as to do no harm to Turkey or to Europe,\r\nand to do good to us.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's other letter was on the Batta question, upon which he does not\r\nlike contradiction, yet I think his course would lead to continued demands\r\non the part of all the armies. I have told him I shall be in town to see\r\nthe Chairs on Saturday, and will try to see him on Friday, and, if he\r\nwishes, bring the Chairs to him on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 21._\r\n\r\nReceived a long confused letter from Fitzgerald upon my project of a draft\r\nto Lord Heytesbury. He was at Sudborn, [Footnote: Seat of Lord Hertford, in\r\nSuffolk] where the Duke was. The Duke was not so much inclined to think the\r\nRussians would make any considerable concessions as Aberdeen, but he\r\nthought, and had made Fitzgerald think, it would be premature to\r\nremonstrate. I have written to Fitzgerald and told him my opinion more at\r\nlength than I told Aberdeen yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 23._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Read the despatches from Petersburg and Paris. All the hints\r\nof the Emperor of Russia's intention of not retaining his army in Turkey\r\ncome through Paris, Nesselrode having on September 29 spoken thus\r\nspecifically to the Duke de Mortemart, and merely talked about taking less\r\nmoney and making some change in the guarantees to Lord Heytesbury. I did\r\nnot see Aberdeen, who was engaged with the Spanish Minister.\r\n\r\nI do not depart from my original idea that Russia does all this to gain\r\ntime, and with as much perfidy as she has shown throughout.\r\n\r\nPolignac would take a loyal view if he durst.\r\n\r\nI cannot see the Duke till Monday, as he does not return to London till\r\nSunday evening.\r\n\r\nI saw Hardinge and had a long talk with him about Batta, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 24._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11.\r\n\r\nThe Chairs say the Court have the matter entirely in their hands as to\r\nBatta. They wish to have the opinion of the Cabinet, and to be governed by\r\nthat. I have written to the Duke to tell him so.\r\n\r\nI am glad there is to be a Cabinet, because I think a Cabinet will take a\r\nmore popular view of the question than the Duke, and, as I think, a juster\r\nview. I am for standing firm.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's letter on Persian affairs arrived while I was with the Chairs. I\r\nread it to them. The Duke suggests that McDonald should raise his escort in\r\nPersia--an excellent idea. He objects to Major Hart having an assignment of\r\nland. He thinks Willock may be recalled. The officers not; but if the\r\nprince will pay them, so much the better. I think the Duke may be right as\r\nto the assignments of land. Upon all the other points I entirely agree with\r\nhim. Read last night a letter of Lushington's, or rather a minute, which\r\nshows he is determined to remain.\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Cunningham came in and showed me a draft of Aberdeen's to our\r\nMinister in Spain on the recognition by Spain of Don Miguel--finding\r\nexcuses for Spain, and saying we cannot do it. What I saw was the\r\n_brouillon_ which had been sent to the Duke. It had his observations in\r\npencil, and it seems Aberdeen sends all his proposed despatches to him and\r\nalters them at his suggestion. Certainly Aberdeen, left to himself, would\r\nbe a very incautious writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 26._\r\n\r\nOffice early. Saw Captain Hanchett on the subject of the navigation of the\r\nRed Sea. He was there two years and a half. He says in going in you should\r\nmake Aden and wait there for a wind. Water can be had there. Avoid Mocha,\r\nwhere the anchorage is dangerous and the water bad, and go to the Island of\r\nCameran, then straight up in mid channel. All the dangers are visible, and\r\nin the mid channel there are none. Cosseir a good little harbour, the\r\ndanger is going up to Suez; but that easy for a steamer. He worked with\r\ntopgallant sails against the north-west monsoon. There is a breeze along\r\nshore at all times. The danger has been occasioned by the timid sailing of\r\nthe Arabs, who always hug the shore, and anchor at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 27._\r\n\r\nI omitted yesterday to mention that at the Foreign Office I saw some\r\ndespatches just received from Sir R. Gordon. I think the date of the first\r\nwas October 2. He had the day before at last got the Turks to ratify the\r\ntreaty, but it seems there was a hitch, and until the ratification the\r\nofficers did not set off to stop hostilities in Asia. A Pasha had advanced\r\non Philippopoli and General Geismar on Sophia. Diebitch threatened to\r\nadvance on Constantinople. However, the day after he wrote his threatening\r\nletter he must have received the ratifications. The Sultan is very anxious\r\nto get the Egyptian fleet to Constantinople, probably as a pledge for the\r\nallegiance of the Pasha, and to show his greatest vassal obeys him. The\r\nTurks say it is the moral effect of the presence of the fleet on their own\r\nsubjects that they want, that they have no idea of not acting faithfully.\r\nSir R. Gordon assures me they mean to preserve the peace and must.\r\n\r\nHe has written the representation the Turkish ambassador is to present to\r\nthe Emperor. It would be a good remonstrance for us, but it is not a good\r\none for the Turks. It is very well written, but it is quite European in its\r\nstyle, and the Russians will at once know, as I did, the author.\r\n\r\nThe Turks intended to send a splendid embassy to Petersburg, and Halil\r\nPasha, once the slave of the Seraskier, now the Sultan's son-in-law, was to\r\nhave been the ambassador. He is their least officer. However, Diebitch\r\ntells them they must not send it till they have the Emperor's consent. The\r\nTurks have ready the first 100,000 ducats, to get the Russians out of\r\nAdrianople.\r\n\r\nI should say from these despatches that things do not look peaceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 28._\r\n\r\nHad a letter yesterday from Mr. Elphinstone on Nazarre. It appears to be a\r\nfine on descents, &c., of Jaghire lands. I think his opinion will be\r\ndifferent from Sir J. Malcolm's--the latter wishing to make the Jaghires\r\nhereditary, or rather to give a fee simple interest to the actual\r\nproprietor. Mr. Elphinstone, on the contrary, thinking they should be\r\nresumed on death without heirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 29._\r\n\r\nRead a work just published by Colonel de Lacy Evans, on the practicability\r\nof a Russian invasion of India. The route would be first to China, across a\r\ndesert from the shores of the Caspian--from China by water up the Oxus, to\r\nwithin 550 miles of Attock. The great difficulty is between the end of the\r\nriver, and the southern side of the Hindoo Koosh. This difficulty, however,\r\nhas been often surmounted, and the road is constantly travelled by\r\ncaravans.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that the invasion of India could not be attempted till\r\nthe third year; but when should we begin to take precautions? A Government\r\nwholly Asiatic would not be still if the Russians took possession of China;\r\nbut ours, chained by European politics, would hardly move if they entered\r\nCabul.\r\n\r\nWe ought to have full information as to Cabul, Bokhara, and China.\r\n\r\nMy letter of last year directed the attaining of information; but I dare\r\nsay nothing has been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 30._\r\n\r\nReceived a Memorial from Mr. Fullerton, asking some remuneration beyond his\r\nsalary for past services. He has a claim _if we were rich_. I think he\r\nshould have 10,000 dollars. I dare say he thinks 20,000. Thoughtless\r\nextravagance is the destruction of generosity and even of justice.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of the invasion of India my idea is that the thing is not\r\nonly practicable, but easy, unless we determine to act as an Asiatic Power.\r\nOn the acquisition of Khiva by the Russians we should occupy Lahore and\r\nCabul.[Footnote: It may be remembered that Lord Ellenborough strongly\r\ndisapproved of any occupation of Afghanistan, or interference with its\r\ninternal affairs, in 1840-42. At that time Russia had not advanced to\r\nKhiva. It is clear that he would not have held the same opinion as to our\r\npolicy towards Afghanistan after the events of 1873-74.] It is not on the\r\nIndus that an enemy is to be met. If we do not meet him in Cabul, at the\r\nfoot of the Hindoo Koosh, or in its passes, we had better remain in the\r\nSutlege. If the Russians once occupy Cabul they may remain there with the\r\nIndus in their front, till they have organised insurrection in our rear,\r\nand completely equipped their army. I fear there are passes from Balkh upon\r\nPeshawur. If these could be closed and the enemy poured upon Cabul we\r\nshould know where to meet him. Now we, being at Cabul, might be cut off\r\nfrom its resources by the descent of the enemy upon Peshawur.\r\n\r\nThere is some road from Roondorg through Cashmere, but I do not fear that.\r\nThe road an enemy would choose would be that by the Valley of the Cachgu.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of these passes, nothing of the country beyond them,\r\nnothing of the course of the Indus--but we should have full information so\r\nas to be able to crush an advancing enemy, by making the whole country\r\nhostile, which money would do.\r\n\r\nTo meet an invasion we must raise every regiment to 1,000 men.\r\n\r\n    168 Regiments\r\n    360   \"\r\n  -----\r\n  1,008\r\n  504\r\n  ------\r\n  60,480 Men, besides Artillery.\r\n   4,000 King's Inf. raised to 1,000 each Reg.\r\n   1,000 Do. four Regiments of Cavalry.\r\n   4,000 Four new Regiments.\r\n   2,000 Two new Cavalry.\r\n         Besides King's Artillery.\r\n  ------\r\n  71,480\r\n\r\nBesides the increase which would take place in the Irregular Corps,\r\nparticularly in Skinner's.\r\n\r\nA smaller increase than this would not be sufficient; for we should require\r\n20,000 men at Delhi, 20,000 in Lahore, and 60,000 in Cabul. I speak of\r\nenrolled, not effectives--but with these augmentations the Regular Army\r\nwould only be\r\n\r\n  148,000 N.I.\r\n   24,000 King's.\r\n  -------\r\n  172,000\r\n   20,000 Native Cavalry.\r\n    6,000 King's.\r\n  -------\r\n  198,000\r\n\r\nThe out provisional battalions, local corps, &c., of 198,000, I do not\r\nthink above 100,000 could possibly be disposable, and there would not be\r\n70,000 effectives. The Artillery must be very numerous. I omitted the\r\nCompany's English Regiments, about 3,000 men.\r\n\r\nOf all nations the Russians are the least adapted for an enterprise of this\r\nnature. They have neither medical staff nor commissariat, and the men are\r\nwithout resource. A French army would be the best. I doubt the possibility\r\nof Russia bringing more than 20,000 men to Cabul, and these could not\r\ndescend the mountains till the third year, if Cabul was occupied. What I\r\nfear is an occupation of Khiva unknown to us. No preparation on our part--\r\nno marching forward--so that in three or four months from leaving Khiva the\r\nenemy might be at Cabul. I am sure we can defeat the enterprise. We ought\r\nto defeat it before the enemy reaches the Indus. If 20,000 Russians should\r\nreach the Indus, it will be a sharp fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1829._\r\n\r\nA letter from the Duke. He returned the papers I sent him. He has doubts as\r\nto the expediency of making the Commissary-General of Stores I proposed;\r\nbut he seems to have supposed I wished to do away with the Military Board.\r\nI have explained what I meant.\r\n\r\nHe approves of my suggestions as to correspondence, but thinks every paper\r\nmust be sent home, and the collections formed here. I have explained that I\r\nalways intended every paper should be sent home, and I have told him that I\r\nhad the opinion of the clerks I consulted that the collections might be\r\nframed in India, with a saving of time, and without diminishing the check\r\non the local Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 4._\r\n\r\nReceived from Aberdeen his draft of a remonstrance to Russia, which, it\r\nseems, must be sent at last. He has already shown it to the Duke and Peel.\r\n\r\nThere is no great substantive objection to it; but it is not very carefully\r\nwritten. I shall send it to him tomorrow with many proposed alterations. In\r\nthe second box came Gaily [Footnote: H. Gaily Knight. Best known for his\r\nworks on the Normans in Sicily, and Ecclesiastical Architecture in Italy.]\r\nKnight's letter to Aberdeen; which is a poor, flimsy production. A\r\npeacock's feather in the hilt of a Drawcansir's sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 5._\r\n\r\nAltered, not only verbally, but substantially, Aberdeen's paper, and sent\r\nit to him.\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Read a Memorandum by Lord Heytesbury, of a conversation he\r\nhas had with the Emperor of Russia. The Emperor expects the early downfall\r\nof the Porte--and a Revolution in France. Asks if another march to Paris\r\nwould be possible? Lord Heytesbury saw Nesselrode afterwards and told him\r\nwhat the Emperor had said. Nesselrode said the Emperor always saw things\r\n_en noir_. He had a different opinion. He did not think the Porte in\r\nimmediate danger, nor did he expect a French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe other guarantees they talk of are further cessions in Asia,\r\nspecifically Batoum, or the occupation of Varna, or Silistria, instead of\r\nthe Principalities. The latter is worse, and the Turks will probably\r\nconsent to neither. They do not value the Principalities, and they know\r\nEurope does.[Footnote: The Principalities, as commanding the lower course\r\nof the Danube, were all important to Austria especially. Thus, occupation\r\nby Russia, while it would have been felt as a menace to Central Europe,\r\nwould have left Turkey a compact state beyond the Danube.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 6._\r\n\r\nSaw Aberdeen. He is always gloomy about _divisions_. He is afraid of an\r\nattack on Foreign Policy. He thinks the two parties will unite in that. He\r\nhears there has been some approximation between Lord Grey [Footnote: Lord\r\nGrey had been separated from the bulk of the Whig party since their\r\njunction with Canning in 1827.] and Lord Holland. At the same time it is\r\nsaid there is a notion of bringing in Lord Grey. I suspect this report to\r\nhave been fabricated by the Ultra-Tories to annoy the King.\r\n\r\nHe thinks the Duke is annoyed, more particularly at the King's not treating\r\nhim well, and at his Government not being well supported.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however, it is a Government which will not fall, for the King\r\nhates the Whigs; the people do not regard them. He may like the Tories, but\r\nhe knows they cannot make a Government, and the Duke's Administration has\r\nfour-fifths of the country.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from the Duke, telling me he had settled Colonel\r\nMcDonald's knighthood, and asking me if I should be ready to talk about\r\nIndia on the 13th. I said about Batta certainly; about India I had rather\r\ntalk first to Lord Melville and him.\r\n\r\nWrote to the Duchess of Kent telling her a Bengal cavalry cadetship was at\r\nher disposal for the son of Colonel Harvey.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting letter from an English officer at Adrianople\r\nwith respect to the state of the Russian army. It has suffered and suffers\r\nmost dreadfully.\r\n\r\nI told Aberdeen if I had seen the account of the conversation between Lord\r\nHeytesbury and the Emperor Nicholas before I read his proposed letter, I\r\nshould have suggested that much stress should have been laid upon the\r\neffect the downfall of Turkey would have upon affairs in France.\r\n\r\nPolignac seems confident he can stand. He thinks he has the Chambers. The\r\nFrench behave ill in the settlement of the Greek business, and object\r\naltogether to our man, Prince Philip of Hesse Homburg. They equally object\r\nto Prince Frederick of Orange, and to Prince Leopold, whom Russia would\r\nhave had willingly. I wonder Aberdeen did not laugh when he was proposed.\r\nThey want to settle the thing without a Prince. I suppose they want a\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\nAberdeen is for settling Greece as a Power into whose lap the broken parts\r\nof Turkey may fall. He gives up Euboea. That is, the surrender of Euboea is\r\nto be proposed to the Porte, with a frontier limited in other respects,\r\ninstead of the protocol of March 22.\r\n\r\nThe Turks who have left the Morea have no indemnity. The Turks who are in\r\nthe other parts of the new Greece remain. It is altogether a wonderful\r\nbusiness. These anti-revolutionary States combining to revolutionise a\r\nrebellious province of an unoffending ally!\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 11._\r\n\r\nIt seems the French do not like the idea of giving to the Turks the option\r\nof an independent State with smaller limits, or of a State under\r\nSuzeraineté with extended limits, contrary to the treaty, and sending at\r\nthe same time secret instructions to the Ambassadors to insist upon the\r\n_entire_ independence of the new Greek State. The French seem likewise to\r\nhave been offended at the protocol having been settled between Russia and\r\nus, before they were called in to give their opinion. No wonder. Certainly\r\nour diplomacy has not succeeded. We have failed in all our objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 13._\r\n\r\nCabinet. I was first called upon to say my say upon the general Indian\r\nquestion. I observed that the present prospective deficiency was one\r\nmillion a year. That until we could ascertain whether that deficiency could\r\nbe diminished or done away with we were really not ourselves prepared to\r\ncome to a decision upon the future government of India; nor would\r\nParliament endure that the China trade should be closed upon the country\r\nfor twenty years more without first inquiring whether it was necessary. The\r\nfirst question was, 'Can we make such a reduction of expenditure, or effect\r\nsuch an increase in income as to enable the Government of India to go on\r\nwithout any assistance direct or indirect from England?' If it can, then we\r\nhave the China trade in our hands. If it cannot, we have to decide whether\r\nthe necessary assistance shall be found by means of a continuance of the\r\nmonopoly or in some other manner.\r\n\r\nI stated the increase of two millions in six years in the civil charges of\r\nBengal; that the Court had issued the strongest instructions, and the local\r\nGovernment seemed to have a real intention to curtail expenditure. That I\r\nhad done something, and should do all I could, investigating every item.\r\nPeel suggested a commission. I said that had occurred to me last year. The\r\nDuke, however, objected to a commission as really superseding the Governor-\r\nGeneral and being the Government. Another objection certainly is the delay.\r\nDifficulties would be thrown in its way, and we should at last be obliged\r\nto decide without its final report, having thrown away our time here in\r\nwaiting for it.\r\n\r\nI mentioned that the character of the local Government was 'disrespect and\r\ndisobedience.' That nothing but a long continuance of strict rule could\r\nbring India into real subjection. It was this disobedience which was the\r\nchief source of increased expenditure. It arose in a great measure from the\r\nunequal hand which had been held over them--the indulgence of the Court of\r\nDirectors--and the great delays in the communication with India arising out\r\nof the system of correspondence. I had endeavoured to remedy that, and\r\nhoped to get an answer to letters within the year. It was now two years and\r\na half. I had likewise endeavoured to make arrangements for steam\r\ncommunication by the Red Sea. I hoped to be able to send a letter to Bombay\r\nin sixty days.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet seemed generally to acquiesce in the expediency of only having\r\na Committee this year.\r\n\r\nAt first they all seemed to think the continuance of the government in the\r\nCompany a matter of course. I told them that even with the China trade the\r\nGovernment could not now go on without great reductions of expenditure, and\r\nthat I hoped the Cabinet would not come to a hasty decision upon a question\r\ninvolving so many important political and financial considerations. The\r\npresent system was not one of great expense, but it was one involving great\r\ndelay--and delay was expense, and not only expense but abandonment of\r\nauthority. It was in this point of view that I hoped the Cabinet would look\r\nat the question when it came before them.\r\n\r\nI mean to go quietly to work; but I mean, if I can, to substitute the\r\nKing's government for that of the Company. [Footnote: This was not carried\r\nout till 1858, after the great mutiny.] I am sure that in doing so I shall\r\nconfer a great benefit upon India and effect the measure which is most\r\nlikely to retain for England the possession of India.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards spoke of the Batta question. I read Lord Wellesley's letter,\r\nand stated the opinions of Sir J. Malcolm, Sir Archibald Campbell, and Sir\r\nJ. Nicholls.\r\n\r\nI stated that it seemed the feeling in the army was excited more by the\r\napprehension of further reductions than by the establishment of the half-\r\nBatta stations; that if concessions were made to the Bengal army, the other\r\narmies would be discontented and further demands would be made.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said, as a soldier, and having been in India at the time, he must\r\nsay he thought the orders of 1828 [Footnote: Orders issued by Lord William\r\nBentinck, abolishing full batta or the larger scale of allowances to the\r\nmilitary at stations where half-batta only had been recognised, before the\r\nAct of the Bengal Government allowing full batta in consideration of\r\nofficers providing themselves with quarters.--See Thornton's _British\r\nIndia_, pp. 221-25.] a breach of faith--but these having been issued, he\r\nthought we must stand to them. The general opinion was that as nothing\r\ncould be said or done till the arrival of despatches, there could be no\r\nnecessity for deciding.\r\n\r\nI mentioned my Supreme Court Bill, which will be ready immediately.\r\n\r\nI hope to save--ultimately 60,000 pounds a year in the Supreme Courts.\r\n\r\n                                 £\r\n     £1,000 on each Judge..... 9,000\r\n     1 Judge at Calcutta...... 5,000\r\n     1 Judge at M. and B...... 8,000\r\n     Recorder's Court......... 8,000\r\n     Fees at Calcutta........ 30,000\r\n                              ------\r\n                             £60,000\r\n\r\nIreland is put off till Monday, that we may all read the papers. We dine\r\nwith the Duke to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe French oppose all the people we name for the Greek coronet. They have\r\nnamed Prince Charles of Bavaria, and the second son of the King of Bavaria\r\nwith a regency till he is of age! However, this folly they did not press.\r\n\r\nWe first named Prince Philip of Hesse Homburg, whom the French would not\r\nhear of. Then Leopold! They did not like him. Prince Emilius of Hesse\r\nDarmstadt was thought of. The French have suggested Prince John of Saxony,\r\nsecond son of the King, a fine young man, about 28, but unknown. His elder\r\nbrother too may soon succeed to the throne, and he has no children.\r\nOtherwise there is no objection to this Prince.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me they are running after trifles. Russia adheres to us as to\r\nthe Prince, or rather remains neutral, thinking I have no doubt that France\r\nand England will quarrel about the feather.\r\n\r\nThe secret instruction which it was proposed to give to the Ambassadors is\r\nnow abandoned, France having objected. They were to have been ordered to\r\n_insist_ upon Turkey taking one of two things of which she was to have\r\nostensibly the pure option. Now they are only clearly to intimate their\r\n_wish_. However, it seems Russia will take a million of ducats less if\r\nTurkey will make Greece independent. That is, she will give up a claim to\r\nwhat she cannot get in order to effect that she has no right to ask.\r\n\r\nThe French Government have, by giving new rates of pension, got 1,600 old\r\nofficers out of the army, and filled important stations with friends of\r\ntheir own. They think they shall stand.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention the Archduke Maximilian of Modena as one of the persons\r\ntalked of for Greece. It seems uncertain whether any one of these Princes\r\nwould take the coronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 14, Saturday._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Rosslyn and afterwards Lord Bathurst there. Read the Irish\r\npapers, that is, Lord Francis Leveson's private letters to Peel and Peel's\r\nto him, with a letter from Peel to Leslie Foster, asking his opinion as to\r\neducation and Maynooth, and Foster's reply. The latter is important. He\r\nthinks the political and religious hostility of the two parties is\r\nsubsiding. The chiefs alone keep it up. The adherents are gradually falling\r\noff. To open the questions of education, &c., now, would be to open closing\r\nwounds, nor would anything be accomplished. The priests would resist\r\neverything proposed, and the Protestants would not be satisfied. The\r\nKildare Street Society, however defective, does a great deal of good, more\r\nthan could be expected from any new system we could carry at this moment.\r\n\r\nAs to Maynooth, to withdraw the grant would not diminish the funds, while\r\nit would increase the bad feeling.\r\n\r\nThe increased prevalence of outrage, arising more from a disorganised state\r\nof society than from politics or religion, and the _assassination_ plan,\r\nmust be met by an extensive police, directed by stipendiary magistrates;\r\nand the expense of this police, and the indemnity to sufferers must be paid\r\nby the barony in which the outrage takes place.\r\n\r\nAll Peel's letters are very sensible. Lord Francis Leveson's are in an odd\r\nstyle, rather affected occasionally, and his ideas are almost always such\r\nas require to be overruled. He is a forward boy; but I see nothing of the\r\nstatesman in him. We ought to have had Hardinge there.\r\n\r\nDined at the Duke's. A man of the name of Ashe is writing letters to the\r\nDuke of Cumberland threatening his life if he does not give up a book in\r\nMS.\r\n\r\nThis book of Ashe's is a romance detailing all sorts of scandals of the\r\nRoyal Family, and of horrors of the Duke of Cumberland. The book is\r\nactually in the possession of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe King's violence, when there was an idea of Denman's [Footnote: The King\r\nalways resented an offensive quotation of Denman's as counsel during the\r\nQueen's trial.] appearing for the Recorder, was greater, the Duke says,\r\nthan what he showed during the Catholic question.\r\n\r\nLady Conyngham has been and is very ill. There is no idea of the Court\r\ngoing to Brighton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 16._\r\n\r\nCabinet. France, Austria, and England to ask Don Pedro distinctly what he\r\nmeans to do. We certainly cannot go on as we are with Portugal for ever.\r\nAberdeen fears France may acknowledge Miguel first, and thus take our place\r\nwith Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Duke says if we can keep Spain on good terms with Portugal, and with\r\nourselves, the connection of France and Portugal does not signify, and we\r\nare much better off than with Portugal against Spain and France. This is\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nA long talk about Ashe, who has written a libel on the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nwhich the Duke gave to the Duke of Wellington. Ashe wants it back, and\r\nthreatens if he has it not returned to him; but in a letter, and in such\r\nterms that the Attorney-General does not think him liable to prosecution.\r\nHe might be held to bail, perhaps, but that would bring out the case. It\r\nwas decided to do nothing, but to take precautions against his doing\r\nmischief. The Duke of Cumberland has been cautioned.\r\n\r\nThe Insurrection Act seems to be popular with Fitzgerald. Peel says it is\r\nbad in principle, and has the effect of placing the higher classes in\r\nhostility against the lower. The decision seemed to be to have a powerful\r\npolice--stipendiary magistrates--frequent trials--constables appointed by\r\nGovernment--counties paying for additional police.\r\n\r\nPeel suggests the division of Ireland into smaller districts, and the\r\nacquiring a personal knowledge of individuals, and making the districts\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nI believe the country is too populous, and the population too wicked, for\r\nthis plan to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe murderers will be brought in from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe state of demoralisation in which the country is is dreadful. Murders\r\nare held to be of no account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 17._\r\n\r\nRead, as I came down to Worthing, Colonel McDonald's last despatches, and\r\nhis private letter, which I received last night. Sent them to the Duke, and\r\nasked whether under the circumstances we should let Abbas Murza have some\r\nthousand stand of arms, Colonel McDonald doing his best to secure ultimate\r\nrepayment.\r\n\r\nThe Persian cavalry raised by the Russians in their newly conquered\r\nterritories seem to have fought as well as any troops in their service.\r\nColonel McDonald says it is from a disciplined Persian army alone,\r\ncommanded by Russian officers, that he dreads the invasion of India. A\r\nEuropean force would be wasted by the climate. The Pasha of Suleimania had\r\ntoo European a taste, and wanted to make regular soldiers without pay or\r\nclothing. So his soldiers turned him out, and made his brother Pacha.\r\n\r\nColonel McDonald describes all that side of Turkey as going _au devant du\r\nconquérant_. Such has been the wretchedness of their government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worthing, November 18, 1829._\r\n\r\nAt 11 P.M. received a letter from the Duke of Wellington by a messenger,\r\ntelling me he regretted I had not met Lord Melville and him before the\r\nCabinet, and proposing, as he and Lord Melville both wished to go out of\r\ntown on Friday, that I should meet them either to-morrow, after 2, or on\r\nFriday morning.\r\n\r\nI wrote to say I would be with him at 3 to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 19._\r\n\r\n\r\nMet the Duke and Lord Melville.\r\n\r\nAfter conversation on topics connected with the subject we came to the\r\npoint, which was that the Duke wished both to preserve the monopoly and the\r\nCompany as administrators of Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Duke is much swayed by early recollections. He is besides very desirous\r\nof having the City of London in his hands.\r\n\r\nI admitted that the great and solid objection to placing the government of\r\nIndia directly in the hands of the Crown was the consequent increase of\r\nParliamentary business, already too extensive to be well performed.\r\n\r\nAs to the China trade, if the Government of India can be conducted without\r\nthe assistance derived from it, I saw no reason for its continuance; but I\r\nhad rather continue the monopoly than lose the Company as a trading Company\r\nto China, for I thought the trade might be greatly endangered were their\r\ncommerce to cease. I said that the continuance of the system of carrying on\r\nthe government through the instrumentality of the Company was not\r\ninconsistent with giving to it the efficiency, the vigour, and the celerity\r\nof the King's Government.\r\n\r\nLord Melville admitted the cumbrousness of the present system.\r\n\r\nThe Duke seemed to have no objection to alterations in details, provided\r\nthe principle were adhered to.\r\n\r\nBoth to-day and in the Cabinet on Friday last I was surprised by Lord\r\nMelville's inertness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke wishes Leach's paper to be 'the case to be proved.' This may be\r\ndone, and yet the necessary improvements introduced.\r\n\r\nMet Seymour, who had been with the Duke. He is just come from Berlin. He\r\nseemed to say that the great success of the war was wholly unexpected by\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 20._\r\n\r\nWrote to Hylton Jolliffe to beg he would turn his attention to the subject\r\nof steam navigation to India by the Red Sea, as a private speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 21._\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Sir G. Murray. It seems the Duke, Lord Melville, and Sir\r\nGeorge are to meet soon to consider whether some alteration should not be\r\nmade in the rules of the Order of the Bath. I suggested that it might be an\r\nimprovement to make civilians eligible to the lower grades of the Order. It\r\nmight occasionally be very convenient to make a man a K.C.B. for civil\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, November 22._\r\n\r\nTold Bankes what the Duke wished respecting the Charter; but I likewise\r\ntold him it had not yet been so determined in Cabinet, and that there was\r\nno objection to our making the Government more rapid and vigorous, and less\r\nlike the Tullietudlem coach. I desired him to consider this _confidential_\r\nto himself and the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 25._\r\n\r\nReceived a note from Bankes announcing that the Duke had accepted his\r\nretirement from the office of secretary, and had consented to make him an\r\nextra commissioner.\r\n\r\nThis has long been an idea of Bankes's, of which I never could see rational\r\nground. Indeed, he seems to acknowledge it is not his own idea, but that of\r\nothers, that on his return to the Government he should not have returned to\r\nthe same office. In fact it is the influence of the Duke of Cumberland, and\r\nit is evident from the endeavour to detach Bankes from the Government now\r\nthat the Brunswickers still have hopes. It is like giving notice to Lot and\r\nhis family before the fall of fire and brimstone.\r\n\r\nBankes's letter is full of kind and grateful expressions towards me.\r\nIndeed, we have always been on very friendly and confidential terms. I have\r\nexpressed my regret at his resolution. I told him I think he acts upon\r\nmistaken views, and I assure him that in whatever position he may stand\r\ntowards the Board, it will afford me much pleasure and advantage to remain\r\non the same terms with him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke will be angry, and I do not think Bankes will soon get an office\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 2._\r\n\r\nRead for an hour at the Cabinet room. There is a curious account of a\r\nconversation between De Rigny and an Austrian friend at Smyrna. De Rigny\r\nthinks very ill of the Government, and of the state of France. He too wants\r\nthe Rhine! He judges truly enough of the results of the treaty. 'England,\r\nAustria, and France will talk, but nothing will be done.' He says Russia\r\nwas very foolish not to go on. She might have dared anything. However, the\r\narmy seems to have suffered severely. They acknowledge the loss of 130,000\r\nmen in the two campaigns.\r\n\r\nDiebitch has partly evacuated Adrianople, leaving there, however, 6,000\r\nsick and a battalion. The plague spreads in the Principalities, and they do\r\nnot know how to get the troops out of Turkey.\r\n\r\nZuylen de Neyvelt and others give a very bad account of the state of\r\nConstantinople. They say the Turkish Empire _cannot_ hold together.\r\n\r\nI do not like Lord Stuart's account of the state of the French Ministry.\r\nThey will bring in Villele, who is an able man, and he may save them; but\r\ntheirs is a desperate game.\r\n\r\nThe French seem to be disposed to go along with us in negotiating with the\r\nEmperor of Brazil [Footnote: _i.e._ with the Emperor Don Pedro, father of\r\nthe ultimately successful candidate for the Portuguese throne, Donna Maria\r\nde Gloria.] for the recognition of Miguel. There would be a stipulation for\r\namnesty, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 3._\r\n\r\nThe Chairs talked of Lord William Bentinck. They are very much out of\r\nhumour with him and heartily wish he was at home. He has neither written\r\nprivately nor publicly, except upon trifling matters, for five months. He\r\nhas declared his opinion in favour of colonisation. He is very unpopular.\r\nOn the subject of Sir W. Rumbold he and Sir Ch. Metcalfe are very hostile,\r\ntaking extreme views on the different sides. This hostility upon one\r\nsubject will lead to difference upon others. The Government is not\r\nrespected--and certainly there has been no moment when it was of more\r\nimportance that the head of the Government should be respected than when it\r\nis necessary to effect a great economical reform. They describe the feeling\r\nat Madras as being still worse. There they did not think the governor an\r\n_honest man_.\r\n\r\nThe Chairs expect a letter from Macdonald to the Secret Committee with\r\ncopies of his last despatches which I have already received through\r\nPetersburg, so they are unwilling to accept a communication of them from\r\nme. The letter, permitting Abbas Murza to purchase 12,000 stand of arms and\r\nto pay for them by instalments, will therefore go without any reference to\r\nthe last despatches received.\r\n\r\nSaw Aberdeen. He agrees with me in feeling much apprehension on the state\r\nof France as well as of Turkey. He seems, however, to think more of the\r\nstate of parties here, and does not like the looks of the Duke of\r\nCumberland (who was nearly dying last week) and of the King. It seems the\r\nKing, although very well satisfied with measures of a public nature, is\r\nannoyed at not carrying some small jobs.\r\n\r\nThere was a great party at Woburn lately, and the world of course say there\r\nis an approximation to the Grey party. Aberdeen thinks the Woburn party\r\nshowed good wishes, and Lord Grey, it is said, does not mean to come up to\r\ntown. However, he is said to think he has been slighted, whereas the Duke\r\nof Wellington _cannot_ do anything for him in the hostile state of the\r\nKing's mind.\r\n\r\nI told Aberdeen confidentially of Bankes's going out, which is an\r\nindication, no doubt, of continued hostility on the part of the Duke of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge. Talked on various public subjects, and then told him of the\r\nprobability that in three months Lord W. Bentinck would be recalled. I\r\nasked him whether he could be induced to go as Governor-General. He\r\nrejected the idea at first as unsuited to his rank in the army. I said we\r\ncould make him Captain-General. He seemed to think it was a great field for\r\na man who wished to obtain great fame, and if he was unmarried he would not\r\nbe disinclined to go, but I should think domestic considerations would\r\nprevent him. I wish we had him as secretary in Ireland, but he is wanted\r\n_everywhere_. He is so useful. He would be _most useful_ in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSaw the Duke. I told him what the Chairs had said. He said he always\r\nthought Lord William would not succeed. Who could we get to replace him? He\r\nhad always thought it did not signify as long as we had _one_ man in India;\r\nbut we must have _one_. I told him that, seeing the difficulty of\r\nselection, I had thought it right to tell him what was likely to happen. I\r\nshould not be much surprised if he thought of Lord Tweddale, whom he\r\nthought of for Ireland. I do not know him at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 6._\r\n\r\nRead Sir W. Rumbold's letters, and the minutes in Council on the Hyderabad\r\ncase. Sir W. is a cunning, clever man. Sir Ch. Metcalfe shows too much\r\nprejudice against Sir W. Rumbold; but he was at Hyderabad at the time, and\r\nhe may be right. I suspect it was a disgraceful business.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 9._\r\n\r\nLoch has got a cadetship for me. Colonel Baillie lends it. He postpones a\r\nnomination till next year in order to oblige me. I have thanked Loch, and\r\nbegged him to thank Colonel Baillie.\r\n\r\nWrote to Lady Belfast to tell her Mr. Verner had his cadetship. Begged her\r\nto make his family and friends understand thoroughly that this was a\r\nprivate favour I had led her to expect long before the discussion of the\r\nCatholic question.\r\n\r\nWrote to Lord Hertford and enclosed an extract from my letter to Lady\r\nBelfast.\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Sir J. Malcolm, who is again troubled by Sir J. P.\r\nGrant. He enclosed a letter of his upon the subject to Lord W. Bentinck.\r\nThe concluding paragraph of this letter refers to a letter from Lord\r\nWilliam of June 18, at which time the spirit of the Bengal army continued\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Jones, who will set himself to work about the navigation\r\nof the Indus. He says a Mr. Walter Hamilton speaks of the river being\r\nnavigable for vessels of 200 tons to Lahore, and that from Lahore to the\r\nmouth of the river, 700 miles, is only a voyage of twelve days. And no\r\nBritish flag has ever floated upon the waters of this river! Please God it\r\nshall, and in triumph, to the source of all its tributary streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 11._\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Lord Bathurst respecting the recall of Sir J. P. Grant.\r\nHe had imagined I had said he had resigned. He seems surprised I should\r\nhave supposed it possible a judge should be recalled without a formal\r\nmeeting of the Privy Council. I reminded him of Sir T. Claridge's case, not\r\nhalf so strong as that of Sir J. P. Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 12._\r\n\r\nRead Fraser's travels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 13._\r\n\r\nA letter from Sir J. Malcolm, by which it seems that my letter to him of\r\nFebruary 21 has been copied and become public: much to his annoyance.\r\n[Footnote: This was the letter with the expression about a wild elephant\r\nbetween two tame ones which afterwards attracted so much criticism. It was\r\nintended as a private letter to Sir J. Malcolm, but by a mistake of one of\r\nhis secretaries was copied as an official communication.]\r\n\r\nHe sends me his letter to Lord W. Bentinck upon the subject. It seems by\r\nthis letter, which adverts to other topics, that the spirit in Bengal is\r\nvery bad--that Lord W. has hitherto done nothing to check it, and that with\r\nthe press in his power he has allowed it to be more licentious than it ever\r\nwas before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 14._\r\n\r\nFound at Roehampton a letter from the Duke enclosing one addressed by Mrs.\r\nHastings to the King, applying for a pension. The King recommends it to the\r\nconsideration of the Court of Directors. I doubt the Court venturing to\r\npropose any pension to the Court of Proprietors.\r\n\r\nI had another letter from the Duke enclosing a letter to him from Sir J.\r\nMalcolm and a copy of Sir J. Malcolm's letter to Lord W. Bentinck,\r\nrespecting the unauthorised publication of my private letter--the same I\r\nreceived yesterday. Sir J. Malcolm speaks of an intended deputation from\r\nthe Bengal army to England, which Lord William was determined not to allow;\r\nbut Sir J. Malcolm seems to think that Lord William by his conduct at first\r\nbrought on much of what has taken place. He has relaxed the reins of\r\nGovernment too much. I am satisfied that, without a change of form and\r\nname, it will be very difficult to regain the strength the Government has\r\nlost in India.\r\n\r\nI shall see the Duke if I can to-morrow and suggest the appointment of Sir\r\nJ. Malcolm as provisional successor to Lord William. Sir J. Malcolm's\r\nsentiments are known, and his nomination would show the feeling of the\r\nGovernment here. It would be a hint to Lord William that we could replace\r\nhim at once and make him do his duty. It would, in the event of anything\r\nhappening to Lord William, guard against the mischiefs of an interregnum,\r\nwhich is always a time of weakness and of job.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 15._\r\n\r\nThe Duke gone to the Deepdene. Wrote to him to say I would not fail to\r\nbring the question of Mrs. Hastings's pension before the Chairs; but I\r\nenclosed a memorandum showing all that had been done for old Hastings, and\r\nreminded the Duke that the Court could not grant above 200£ a year without\r\nthe sanction of two Courts of Proprietors.\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Lord Heytesbury seems to have shown Nesselrode the protocol\r\nabout November 25. The Count was greatly agitated, and put himself into a\r\nfurious passion. Asked the use of it? Perhaps it would be difficult to say.\r\nSupposed it was intended for Parliament--which is very true. Said it would\r\nlead to a reply we should not like--create a paper war, prevent the two\r\nCourts from remaining upon the friendly terms he had hoped were\r\nre-established. The more angry he is, the more right I think we must\r\nfeel we were to send it.\r\n\r\nThere is a good paper of Aberdeen's to Sir R. Gordon, in which he considers\r\nthe Turkish Empire as falling, and our interest as being to raise Greece,\r\nthat that State may be the heir of the Ottoman Power. With this view he\r\nconsiders it to be of primary importance that the Government of new Greece\r\nshould not be revolutionary, and the Prince a good one.\r\n\r\nThere is another good paper defending England against an accusation of\r\nMetternich that we should have spoken in a firmer tone to Russia at an\r\nearlier period. The King seems much taken with these papers, and writes\r\ngreat encomiums upon them.\r\n\r\nBy Lord Stuart's account it appears probable that Villele will come in. The\r\nGovernment mean to avoid all questions upon which it is possible to have a\r\ndifference of opinion, and to bring forward only measures of clear and\r\nundeniable utility. They think that, if their opponents should endeavour to\r\nthrow out these measures, the Chambers will support Government.\r\n\r\nFrance coincides with us entirely as to the Portuguese question; but\r\nwishes, and she is right, that questions more specific had been put to the\r\nEmperor Pedro. The intention seems to be to acknowledge Miguel on\r\nconditions, when Pedro admits he can do nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 16._\r\n\r\nRead Lord Ashley's memorandum on the judicial administration of India. I\r\nwrote a note on returning it in which I said he seemed to have taken great\r\npains to collect the opinions which had been given by different persons\r\nupon the subject. Mine had been expressed by me in a letter to Sir J.\r\nMalcolm on August 7, in which I declared my general concurrence in the\r\nviews entertained by him and intimated by him in his minute, giving an\r\naccount of his tour in the southern Mahratta country. I had added that I\r\nwas satisfied the more we could avail ourselves of the services of the\r\nnatives in the fiscal and judicial administration the better, and that all\r\ngood government must rest upon the village system. I told Sir J. Malcolm I\r\nhad come to my office without any preconceived opinions, that I had kept\r\nout of the way of prejudiced men, and had allowed opinions to form\r\nthemselves gradually in my own mind as I acquired more knowledge from pure\r\nsources. I could not, if I had written this passage on purpose, have had\r\none more suited to my purpose. It showed Ashley I was not _prejudiced_,\r\nthat my opinions were formed before I read his memorandum, and that I had\r\nformed them by abstaining from the course he has pursued--for he allows all\r\nsorts of persons to come and talk to him, and to inoculate him with their\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\nI afterwards said that he would see by Sir Thomas Munro's memorandum of\r\nDecember 31, 1824, that he thought we had succeeded better in the judicial\r\nthan in the fiscal administration of India, and in the criminal better than\r\nin the civil branch of the judicial government. This I said to show I had\r\nread Sir T. Munro's memorandum, which he did not give me credit for having\r\ndone; and that it was not so much to the judicial as to the revenue branch\r\nthat he should have directed his attention, with a view to improvements--\r\nthe field being greater.\r\n\r\nI then said I did not doubt that there were capable natives to be found,\r\nbut I did doubt that they would be selected, for that the European servants\r\nhad disappointed me. The natives were better than I expected, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nSaw the Duke. Suggested to him Sir J. Malcolm's being made provisional\r\nsuccessor to Lord W. Bentinck for the reasons I have mentioned. He thought\r\nwell of the suggestion; but said we must consider it, and mention it in\r\nCabinet, as Lord William was a great card, and we must not do anything to\r\noffend unnecessarily him and his connection. The objection occurred to him\r\nthat had occurred to me, that Sir J. Malcolm would die if he went to\r\nCalcutta. I hope he would not go there, that he would remain in the upper\r\nprovinces. But I look to the effect of the nomination upon the conduct of\r\npeople in India, and that of Lord William himself, more than to his actual\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nThe Duke then said we must look not to India only, but to all Asia, and\r\nasked me if I had read Evans's book. I told him I had; that in forty-eight\r\nhours after I read it I had sent a copy to Macdonald and another to\r\nMalcolm. I told him all the views I had with regard to the navigation of\r\nthe Indus and the opening of a trade with Cabul and Bokhara. He said our\r\nminds appeared to have been travelling the same way. We must have good\r\ninformation of what the Russians might be doing there. I reminded him I had\r\ndesired the Government a year ago to obtain information as to all the\r\ncountries between the Caspian and the Indus, and I intended now to give a\r\nmore particular direction. He said Macdonald should have his eye upon the\r\nCaspian, and information as to those countries would be best obtained\r\nthrough natives. I reminded him that that had been the suggestion in my\r\nletter of last year. The Duke's opinion is that it is a question of\r\n_expense only_. That if the Russians got 20,000 or 30,000 men into Cabul we\r\ncould beat them; but that by hanging upon us there they could put us to an\r\nenormous expense in military preparation, and in quelling insurrections.\r\nThey could not move in that direction without views hostile to us, and by\r\nthreatening us there they would think to embarrass us in Europe. I proposed\r\nthat in the event of the Russians moving in that direction we should permit\r\nthe Government of India to act as an Asiatic Power. By money at least, he\r\nallowed, without further orders, not to move in advance without\r\ninstructions. But the Duke is ready to take up the question here in Europe,\r\nif the Russians move towards India with views of evident hostility.\r\n\r\nHe approves of a message going at once with orders to Macdonald.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 18._\r\n\r\nChairs. They will consider favourably Mrs. Hastings's case; but she must\r\naddress her representation to them.\r\n\r\nI told them of my suggestion of making Malcolm provisional successor to\r\nLord William, and the reasons for it. They seemed to like the idea; but the\r\nsame objection occurred to them which had occurred to the Duke and to me--\r\nthat if Malcolm went to Calcutta he would die. I said I did not want him to\r\ngo. I did not look to his going. I looked to the moral effect of the\r\nappointment upon Lord William and upon all their servants in India. They\r\nwant to get some political man of high rank and talents and determined\r\ncharacter to go. They are heartily sick of Lord William. Whom they want to\r\nsend I do not know.\r\n\r\nI told them of my conversation with the Duke and went over the same ground.\r\nThey acquiesced in all I said. We shall have the missions to Scinde and to\r\nLahore, and the commercial venture up the Indus, and the instruction to\r\nMacdonald. In short, all I want.\r\n\r\nDespatches are at hand from Lord William, dated May 1, in triplicate, and\r\nwithout the minutes which are referred to as containing the sentiments of\r\nthe Government. These despatches merely refer the subject to the\r\nconsideration of the Court.\r\n\r\nOne Jones, it seems, has written almost all the memorials, and is\r\nconsidered a rebel more than a Radical.\r\n\r\nWe had a little conversation respecting the future Government of India. I\r\ntold them it must be a strong Government, and I doubted whether in its\r\npresent form it could secure obedience in India. It required more of\r\nappearance. They seemed to feel that. Astell acknowledged there was nothing\r\nimposing in the name of 'the Company,' and that the present Government was\r\nfallen into contempt.\r\n\r\nI told them I was satisfied that the patronage and the appeals should\r\nalways remain where they were. I paid them a high compliment, which they\r\njustly deserve, upon the fairness of their conduct in deciding upon the\r\nclaims of their servants.\r\n\r\nThey feel their Government is weak in its last year; but that the Ministers\r\ncould not do otherwise than have a committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 18._\r\n\r\nWrote a letter to the Duke, which he may send to the King, stating the\r\nresult of my communication to the Chairs respecting Mrs. Hastings.\r\n\r\nRequested information as to the trade of the Caspian, that carried on by\r\nthe caravans to Bokhara, and the general condition of that country,\r\ndesiring likewise that means might be taken to keep us constantly informed\r\nof any movements made by the Russians towards the Sea of Aral, and of any\r\nattempt to make establishments on the east coast of the Caspian.\r\n\r\nWrote to the Duke to tell him what was done and how entirely the Chairs\r\nentered into his views.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 19._\r\n\r\nWrote to Loch to suggest that he should send Meyendorff's and Mouravief's\r\nbooks to Macdonald.\r\n\r\nRead a clever pamphlet on the China trade, and in coming down to Worthing\r\nall the papers Hardinge sent me relative to the new pension regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 20._\r\n\r\nRead Meyendorff's 'Tour in Bokhara.' It contains all the information I want\r\nas to the commerce between Bokhara and Russia. We can easily supply Bokhara\r\nwith many things the Russians now furnish, and with all Indian goods\r\ncheaper by the Indus than the Ganges; but what the Bokharians are to send\r\nus in return I do not well see, except turquoises, lapis lazuli, and the\r\nducats they receive from Russia. We may get shawls cheaper by navigating\r\nthe Indus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 21._\r\n\r\nRead the memorandum the Chairs gave me respecting the application of steam\r\nnavigation to the internal and external communications of India. It has\r\nbeen prepared carefully and ably, and is very interesting. It suggests the\r\nnavigation of the Euphrates to Balis or Bir by steam, and thence the\r\npassage by Aleppo to Latakia or Scanderoon. It likewise suggests that it\r\nmight be more expeditious to cross the desert from Suez to Lake Menzaleh,\r\nor direct to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 22._\r\n\r\nWrote to Lord Hill, telling him of Sir G. Walker's dangerous illness, and\r\nintimating the importance, under the present circumstances of Madras, of\r\nhaving not only a good soldier as Commander-in-Chief, but a man possessed\r\nof good civil qualities.\r\n\r\nSent a copy of this letter to the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 25._\r\n\r\nRead a memorandum of Jones on the last mission to Lahore, and a very long\r\nsecret despatch in 1811 upon the subject of Runjeet Singh's attempt to\r\nestablish himself on the left bank of the Sutlege, and his retreat in\r\nconsequence of remonstrances and military demonstration on the part of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 26._\r\n\r\nCalled by appointment on Lady Macdonald, who came here to speak to me about\r\nSir J. Macdonald's salary and position at Tabriz. She says that after the\r\nletter he wrote, representing the inexpediency of Sir H. Willock's\r\nremaining as his first assistant and the non-existence of any necessity for\r\ntwo assistants, if the Bengal Government do not recall Willock Sir J.\r\nMacdonald cannot remain. She has likewise a good deal to say respecting the\r\nsalary. I think 9,000£ a year a proper salary. The Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople has 8,000£ and a house; but Constantinople is on the sea,\r\nand the charge of bringing European goods to Tabriz through Russia is so\r\nconsiderable that 1,000£ a year ought to be added for the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 29._\r\n\r\nReceived three letters from Lord W. Bentinck, of July 6 and 8 and August 2.\r\nIn that of the 6th he speaks of my private letter to Sir J. Malcolm,\r\npublished in the 'Calcutta Newspaper.' In that of the 8th he sends it to\r\nme, the names being altered, and all between brackets being interpolated,\r\nand in fact in the light of comment. In that of August 2 he speaks of the\r\ntemper of the army, &c., and all public subjects. I have sent the three\r\nletters to the Duke.\r\n\r\nI was glad to have my letter. I can defend every word in it. It contains\r\nthe simile of the elephants, which I am sorry for, as I fear those\r\ndescribed _as tame_ may be foolish enough to endeavour to show they are not\r\nso by affecting a degree of vivacity beyond their nature; but still I can\r\ndefend it.\r\n\r\nLord William describes his position as not agreeable, having to effect the\r\nodious work of reduction. [Footnote: Besides the burning question of 'Half-\r\nBatta,' Lord W. Bentinck's administration was regarded as hostile in spirit\r\nto that of his predecessors, and so disliked by those who had served under\r\nthem, especially by the military.] He says that in India no man thinks of\r\nanything but MONEY, that the local government has incurred great odium by\r\ncarrying into effect the orders of the home authorities. He recommends Sir\r\nCharles Metcalfe as a man standing by Malcolm's side, and fit for the\r\ngovernment of Bombay. I a little fear Sir Charles Metcalfe. He is rather\r\ntoo vehement. I doubt whether he would be a safe man. I am quite sure\r\nCourtney would be a very unfit man. The Governor of Bombay ought to be an\r\nIndian, but who is there?\r\n\r\nLord William represents the Burmese Government as a barbarian Government.\r\nHe says they have sacrificed all who assisted us, and that the difficulty\r\nin retroceding the Tenasserim provinces would be to know what to do with\r\nthe 35,000 people who have sought our protection.\r\n\r\nThis report makes the wisdom of our recent policy yet clearer than it\r\nappeared before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 31._\r\n\r\nRead twenty papers on the opium treaties and management in Central India.\r\nThe Supreme Government have decided upon no longer limiting the extent of\r\ncultivation in Malwa, and upon permitting the free transit of the drug.\r\nThis was expedient because undoubtedly our restrictions led to the most\r\nhostile feelings on the part both of princes and people, to the injury of\r\nthe traders, to violent and offensive interference on our part in the\r\ninternal policy of foreign States, and to smuggling protected by large\r\nbodies of armed men. The smugglers would soon have been Pindarries. This\r\nsystem began only in 1825. It was forced upon the small States, and not\r\nupon that of Gwalior, so that smuggling defeated the object.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 2, 1830._\r\n\r\nReceived from the Duke a note to say the publication of my private letter\r\nto Sir J. Malcolm did not signify one pin's head, and it _will have_ done\r\ngood in India.\r\n\r\nWrote a long letter to Lord William Bentinck. I pressed upon him the\r\nnecessity of making the home and the local authorities draw together. I\r\ntold him he was suffering not for his obedience but for the disobedience of\r\nhis predecessors. Assured him of support, lamented the _ungentlemanlike_\r\ntone of society evidenced by the insult of the commanding officers to him,\r\nand by the publication of my private letter. I spoke in high terms of\r\nLieut. W. Hislop's report on the opium arrangements (which on reflection I\r\nthought better than writing a letter to him), and I likewise spoke highly\r\nof Mr. Scott, the Commissioner in Assam. Acknowledged the Government could\r\nnot have done otherwise than give up the opium treaties; but foretold a\r\nlarge falling off in the opium revenue from over-cultivation in Malwa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 3._\r\n\r\nA letter from Clare on East Indian matters which I answered at length. Sent\r\nPrendergast's pamphlet to Jones.\r\n\r\nRead reports on the Delhi and Firuz Shah's canal, by which it appears my\r\nplan of joining the Sutlege and Jumna is not visionary. It has been done.\r\nThe canal can still be traced. Delhi seems in distant times to have been\r\nlike Milan, in the midst of canals. The grand canal sent a branch through\r\nthe palace. The water has been again turned in the same channel. When the\r\nwater flowed into Delhi on the opening of the canal on May 30, 1820, the\r\npeople went out to meet it and threw flowers into the stream. In those\r\ncountries nothing can be done without water, and with water, and such a\r\nsun, anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 4, 1830._\r\n\r\nHead Eraser's journey and finished it. It is very interesting, and shows\r\nhow completely the Persian monarchy is falling to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 5._\r\n\r\nSaw Wrangham. There is no news. The affairs of the Netherlands, he says,\r\nlook rather better, and Polignac is very stout and says he is very strong.\r\nIt seems great complaints are made of Lord Stuart, who gives little\r\ninformation, and what little he does give is incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 6._\r\n\r\nVesey Fitzgerald will certainly not be able to attend the House this year.\r\nHis physicians say he would die in five minutes if he got up to speak. I\r\nheard G. Dawson tell the Duke to-day. I rather suspect G. Dawson would like\r\nVesey's place.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has been much occupied with the Greek question. I have not yet\r\nread any papers at the Foreign Office. He spoke to me of Bankes's going\r\nout, which he regretted.\r\n\r\nHe had had some conversation last year at Belvoir with Lord Graham upon\r\nIndian affairs, and had been quite surprised to find how much he knew. He\r\nhad thought he only knew how to comb his hair. The Duke thinks of Horace\r\nTwiss for secretary. He had thought of Mr. Wortley, Lord Wharncliffe's son,\r\na very clever young man, but he wanted a _made_ man, not one to learn. I\r\nshall suggest Ashley's taking Horace Twiss's place, and Lord Graham being\r\nFirst Commissioner. This will force him to come forward. Then Wortley might\r\nbe Second Commissioner. Horace Twiss is a clever man, but rather vulgar.\r\nHowever, he is a lawyer and a very good speaker, and will do very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 7._\r\n\r\nI told the Chairs my views as to an alteration in the Supreme Court Bill.\r\nThey seemed to approve if the thing could be done. I had afterwards some\r\nconversation with the Chancellor upon this subject. He admitted the force\r\nof my reasoning, but desired to have a memorandum about it, which indeed\r\nwill be convenient to me as well as to him. It should state all the new\r\ncircumstances since the establishment of the Supreme Court which render its\r\nexistence less necessary than it was, and more inapplicable than ever to\r\nthe condition of India.\r\n\r\nAt the Duke's dinner I told the Duke and Rosslyn the substance of Lord\r\nWilliam's letters. The Duke said the act [Footnote: In combining to oppose\r\nthe Half-Batta orders. See Thornton's _British India_, vol. v.] of the\r\nofficers was mutiny.\r\n\r\nThe King is ill. He has lost a good deal of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 8._\r\n\r\nThe King quite well again. In the morning began and nearly finished a\r\nmemorandum on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. Conversation respecting the abolition of the Welsh\r\njudgeships, and the addition of a judge to the Courts of King's Bench and\r\nCommon Pleas, or Exchequer. The two new judges would be Circuit Judges of\r\nWales. The Welsh gentlemen seem to be favourable to the change. The\r\nattornies, who are numerous and powerful, very hostile. The Chancellor\r\nintroduces again his Bill of last Session. The Equity is to be separated\r\nfrom the Common Law Jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer. The subject was\r\nonly talked of, and decision deferred till Sunday next.\r\n\r\nWe then talked of Ireland. The Grand Jury Presentment Bill is not yet\r\nprepared. The plan for a police is to place the nominations in the hands of\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant. To send stipendiary magistrates when and where they\r\nare wanted.\r\n\r\nPeel's suggestions went much further; but Lord F. Gower seems to me to be\r\nonly a clever boy. He has as yet proposed _nothing_ worthy of adoption, and\r\nhe has often been near the commission of errors from which he has been\r\nsaved only by Peel's advice.\r\n\r\nHe wished to establish stipendiary magistrates in every county, the effect\r\nof which would have been to disgust all the gentlemen magistrates, and to\r\nlead them to the abandonment of their duty. He wished too to unite in all\r\ncases the inspectorships of police with the office of stipendiary\r\nmagistrate, to avoid collision; but the duties of inspector are of a mere\r\nministerial and inferior character, and would not agree well with those of\r\na magistrate.\r\n\r\nI must read to-morrow all the late protocols and despatches. The Russians\r\nand French have agreed to make Leopold Prince of Greece, but the King\r\ncannot endure the idea. Aberdeen thinks he has made a great conquest in\r\ncarrying the point of Leopold's election. I confess I cannot understand the\r\ngreat advantage we derive from it. What an extraordinary scene! Those\r\nmonarchical states, the most adverse to revolution, combine to assist the\r\nrebellion of a people against its sovereign, a rebellion commenced by\r\nmurder and continued by treachery, stained with every crime that ever\r\ndisgraced human nature! [Footnote: The massacres by the Greeks at\r\nTripolitza and Athens, the latter in direct breach of a capitulation, had,\r\naccording to a not unfavourable historian, cast a dark stain on the Greek\r\ncause and diminished the interest felt for it in foreign countries.\r\n(Alison, _Hist. Europe_, 1815-52, iii. 150.)] They destroy the fleet of an\r\nunoffending Power in a time of profound peace in his own port. They thus\r\nfacilitate the attack of an enemy, and in the extreme peril of the defeated\r\nsovereign they increase their demands in order to form a substantive State\r\nout of the ruins of his Empire. They then elect a Prince unknown to the\r\npeople over whom he is to reign, and support him by equal assistance in\r\nships and money! Those monarchical states set up a revolutionary government\r\nand maintain it in coparcenary! It was reserved for these times to witness\r\nsuch contradictions. I do not think any one is very well satisfied with\r\nthem but Aberdeen. He is charmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, January 10._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Conversation first as to an intended publication by Mr. Stapleton\r\nof a 'Life of Canning,' in which he means to insert the substance, if not\r\nthe copies, of public papers relating to transactions not yet terminated.\r\nHe has had it intimated to him that he will do so at his peril. He holds an\r\noffice under the Government during pleasure. I said he had no right over\r\nprivate letters relating to public subjects which only came to the\r\nknowledge of the writer by his official situation. He should be told it was\r\na high breach of public confidence, and he should be displaced if he was\r\nguilty of it. He will have a hint, but I fear not one sufficiently strong.\r\nIt is Lady Canning who thinks she can injure the Duke of Wellington, and so\r\npublishes these papers. Stapleton is her editor. She demanded from Aberdeen\r\nofficial letters of Canning's, and actually threatened him with a suit in\r\nChancery if he did not give them up. The Duke says he has copies of all\r\nCanning's letters, and he shall publish if they do. [Footnote: Augustus\r\nGranville Stapleton had been private secretary to Canning, and published\r\nabout 1830-31 _The Political Life of George Canning_, and nearly thirty\r\nyears later, _George Canning and his Times_. The latter work contains much\r\ncorrespondence the publication of which might have been objected to at the\r\nearlier date.]\r\n\r\nWe had Scarlett and afterwards Bosanquet in upon the Welsh Judicature\r\nquestion. It was at last decided that the Equity Jurisdiction of the Courts\r\nof Great Session should be sent to the Court of Exchequer, that power\r\nshould be taken to the King of directing the circuits to be held where he\r\npleased, and that the two new judges of the English Courts should do the\r\nduty of the Welsh circuits. The proceedings to be assimilated to those of\r\nthe English Courts.\r\n\r\nThe saving by the reduction of the Welsh judges, after allowing for their\r\npensions, will leave an ample fund for the compensation of the officers\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nI read Lord Stuart de Rothesay's last despatches and Lord Heytesbury's.\r\nThere seems to me to be great over-confidence in their strength on the part\r\nof the French Ministers. I cannot help thinking they will fall. Villele\r\nwill have nothing to do with the Government under this House of deputies,\r\nwhich declared his administration _deplorable_. He seems to stipulate for\r\ntheir dissolution.\r\n\r\nHalil Pacha takes to Petersburg fine presents for the Emperor and Empress,\r\nand other presents he is to distribute 'selon son gré et en son nom' which\r\nare enough to bribe all the ladies in Europe. There is a list of them\r\nextending over seven pages.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be doubtful whether the French have not been endeavouring to\r\ninduce Mehemet Ali to revenge their quarrel with Algiers by marching along\r\nthe whole coast of Africa. The French are much out of humour with their\r\nAlgerine follies, and heartily tired of their expensive gasconade.\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali does not seem much inclined to send _his_ fleet to\r\nConstantinople, although he has honour enough to send the Sultan's.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have launched two large ships (120 and 74), and they have\r\nbought a double-banked frigate built in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, January 11._\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet room, where I met Sir George Murray; read the letters\r\nrelative to the alterations in the judicial system of Scotland.\r\n\r\nRead a letter from Loch, allowing me to show to the Cabinet Lord William's\r\nletters. He wished them to be read, not shown, or rather not circulated;\r\nbut it is contrary to all rule, so I left them to-day on the Cabinet table.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told me yesterday he felt no concession could now be made,\r\nalthough it was a mighty foolish thing to have had a quarrel about.\r\n\r\nGot home at 5, dressed, and was going to business, when I found a note from\r\nDrummond, desiring me to call on the Duke as soon as I could. I ordered the\r\ncarriage and went. Found the Chancellor there.\r\n\r\nIt seems there is a great hitch about Prince Leopold's nomination as Prince\r\nSovereign of Greece. The French have now proposed it. We desire it. Russia\r\nacquiesces. We have always declared we did not care who was Prince\r\nSovereign of Greece, but we were resolved never to acknowledge as such a\r\nman in whom we had not confidence. Some time ago the King of Prussia\r\napplied through the Grand Duke of Mecklenburgh to the King for his vote in\r\nfavour of Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh, the brother of the late Queen of\r\nPrussia and of the Duchess of Cumberland. This application was made through\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland to the King, and the King returned an answer through\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland. What this answer was is not known; but the King\r\nhaving mentioned the circumstance to Aberdeen, and he to the Duke,\r\nAberdeen, by the Duke's desire, wrote through Sir Brook Taylor to the King\r\nof Prussia, and civilly put him off. This letter of course the King saw,\r\nand approved. The Duchess of Cumberland complains the answer of Aberdeen\r\nwas very different from that given through the Duke of Cumberland by the\r\nKing, and says it is an _intrigue_.\r\n\r\nThe King has been put up to this, and tells Aberdeen he knows his own\r\nground--that the people of England will not bear that 50,000£ a year shall\r\nbe paid by them to the Prince of Greece. He does not care whether Leopold\r\ngoes or no, but he is determined he shall leave his annuity behind him.\r\n\r\nThe articles in the 'Standard' and other papers, a few days ago, are\r\nsupposed to have had reference to this then intended rupture. Aberdeen goes\r\nto the King to-morrow, and the Duke having seen all the Cabinet, Aberdeen\r\nwill, if it should be necessary, declare their concurrent opinion. The Duke\r\nthinks the King will yield to Aberdeen; to avoid seeing him--if he is\r\nobliged to go down, he will declare distinctly to the King that his Majesty\r\nhad better name whatever Minister he may wish to give his confidence to;\r\nbut that to whatever Minister he may choose to have, he ought to give his\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nCertainly nothing can have been more scandalous than the King's conduct to\r\nthe Duke. He has never given his Government the fair support. Say what the\r\nDuke will, he of Cumberland is believed.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had a note about the King the other day from Lady Conyngham,\r\nwritten only to tell him the Duke of Cumberland had been four hours with\r\nHis Majesty.\r\n\r\nThat Prince Leopold will make an efficient King of Greece I do not believe;\r\nbut he is not likely to be hostile to England. Prince Charles of\r\nMecklenburgh, named by Prussia, would be really Russian, and the tool of\r\nStates not friendly to us.\r\n\r\nPrince Leopold hopes, if he goes to Greece, that Government will purchase\r\nthe lands he has bought, for which he has given 40,000£ or 50,000£.\r\n\r\nDetermined to have my letter respecting the acquisition of information in\r\nCentral Asia and the navigation of the Indus sent to the Chairs _to-\r\nmorrow_, that _it may_ be sent, and be on record as _mine_, in the event of\r\nHis Majesty turning me out the next day, as he will very possibly do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 12._\r\n\r\nHenry [Footnote: The Honourable H. S, Law, Lord Ellenborough's brother.]\r\ncopied for transmission the letter in the Secret Department, and I took\r\ncare it should be sent to the India House in the course of the day, that if\r\nI should be out to-morrow, I may have the credit of having originated a\r\nmeasure which, if effected, will be of incalculable value.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. Aberdeen was gone to the King at Windsor. It seemed to be\r\nexpected he would do nothing, and that the Duke would be obliged to go down\r\nto-morrow--the Duke thinks he shall succeed--and no one seems to dread a\r\n_turn out_. I am not quite so sure. The mischief is that these _sécousses_\r\nmake a weak Government.\r\n\r\nI found in the box of drafts the letter to Sir Brook Taylor respecting Duke\r\nCharles of Mecklenburgh, which the King says he never saw or sanctioned. It\r\nbears his initials and approval, which have been traced out in ink over his\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland wants, if it be but for a week, a friendly\r\nadministration that he may get out of the Exchequer 30,000£ set apart for\r\nthe annuity for his son's education, but to which he is not legally\r\nentitled, his son having been educated abroad. It is out of revenge for a\r\nhostile cheer, and to get this money, to which Lord Eldon and Lord Wynford\r\nhave told him he has no right, that he is endeavouring to overthrow the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 13._\r\n\r\nAfter I came home read the minutes of the Governor-General and Council on\r\nthe college at Calcutta. There is nothing so important as to preserve young\r\nmen, who are to govern an Empire, from idleness, dissipation, and debt.\r\nThis must be done. The Governor-General's own superintendence may effect\r\nmuch. The suspension of the incompetent may do more; but while the habits\r\nof expense are given at Hayleybury, and continued by their residence\r\nwithout any control in the midst of a dissipated capital, nothing will\r\nreform the system.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Aberdeen's. He was an hour and a half with the King\r\nyesterday. The King was much agitated in dressing himself for the\r\ninterview. The man who shaved thought he should have cut him twenty times.\r\nHe had taken 100 drops of laudanum to prepare himself for the interview.\r\n\r\nAberdeen says it is a _real_ quarrel-not a plot to get rid of us--the King\r\nthoroughly hates Prince Leopold, and he has been made to think the\r\nMinisters have slighted him in this matter. The Duke goes down to him to-\r\nmorrow. He can show the King that Leopold was first mentioned by France--\r\nthat he was made acquainted with the proposal or rather suggestion made by\r\nFrance to Leopold on November 9, that he was then told we could not hear of\r\nit till our candidates, Prince John of Saxony and Ferdinand of Orange, were\r\ndisposed of. The subject was again mentioned on November 24.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact the earliest day on which it could have been made known to\r\nthe King that France had distinctly proposed Leopold was Monday, and he was\r\ntold on the Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe King seems to have been violently agitated. He said sneeringly to\r\nAberdeen, '_If I may be allowed to ask, is Prince Leopold to be married to\r\na daughter of the Duke of Orleans?_' [Footnote: This marriage took place in\r\nAugust 1832, when Prince Leopold had become King of the Belgians, and the\r\nDuke of Orleans King of the French.] Aberdeen said he had seen it in the\r\nnewspaper and knew nothing more of it. The King alluded to the possibility\r\nof Government going out, admitted the inconvenience just before the meeting\r\nof Parliament, but said he was immovable. Leopold might go to the devil,\r\nbut he should not carry English money out of the country. In the morning,\r\ntalking to the Duchess of Gloucester, he said, 'If they want a Prince of my\r\nfamily, they might have had the Duke of Gloucester,' upon which the Duchess\r\nburst out a-laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King seems thoroughly out of humour. He says 'Things seem going on very\r\nill in India. Do not you mean to recall Lord William?' He had been made\r\nvery angry in the morning by the 'Times' calling upon him to pay his\r\nbrother's debts, and this morning the 'Morning Journal' places in\r\njuxtaposition the paragraphs in the 'Times,' and those for which it was\r\nlately prosecuted.\r\n\r\nLady Conyngham is bored to death, and talks and really thinks of removing.\r\nShe was to make a grand attack on the King to-day. I suppose she finds the\r\nDuchess of Cumberland gaining influence. Her note to the Duke the other\r\nday, to tell him the Duke of Cumberland had been four hours with the King,\r\nwas intended to put him upon his guard.\r\n\r\nThe Duke does not mean to resign to-morrow, but to request, if he should\r\nnot succeed (which Aberdeen thinks he will not do), that the King will\r\nallow the Cabinet to put their opinions in writing-which the King cannot\r\nrefuse. We shall then meet on Friday and decide what we shall do.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor took me aside and said it would be a foolish thing to go out\r\nabout Leopold. So it would; but if we allow ourselves to be beaten in this,\r\nwe may be beaten round the whole circle of public questions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke has proved the proposition was not made by us, that it came\r\nfrom France, the King will say, 'Well, if you did not think it worth while\r\nto propose him, why should you not reject him? Why adhere to him?'\r\n\r\nI feel very indifferent about the result.\r\n\r\nDr. Seymour, Fitzgerald's physician, represents him as very ill indeed, and\r\nin _danger_ if he does any business; but Peel, who saw him to-day, thinks\r\nthat much exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 14._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. I asked them to find out when Rothschild sold out his Indian\r\nstock. It seems (by a note I received in the evening) that he began on\r\nOctober 15, and at different times sold out 42,000£ stock. I sent the\r\nChairman's note to Goulburn.\r\n\r\nAbout ten received the promised circular from the Duke. He was an hour and\r\na half with the King, when he was obliged to leave him in consequence of\r\nhis being unwell--and the King afterwards sent to desire he would come\r\nagain on Saturday.\r\n\r\nFor the first hour the King was in a state of irritated and contemptuous\r\nindignation. However, the Duke thinks he brought him to feel he had nothing\r\nto complain of in the conduct of his Government. He finished by getting\r\ninto better temper and a good tone; but the Duke thinks he should have\r\nbrought away his assent if he had been with him another hour. The Duke\r\nwishes to hear the opinion of the Cabinet upon some points, and we meet at\r\ntwo to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 15._\r\n\r\nThe Duke gave the Cabinet an account of his interview with the King. The\r\nKing was with Munster and the Duke of Cumberland when he went; but the Duke\r\nwas admitted in about forty minutes, which time he passed with the Lady\r\nConyngham, who told him he must expect a storm.\r\n\r\nThe King was in bed, looking very ill. He said, 'Well, what is your\r\nbusiness?' and seemed at first most indignant. The Duke, however, corrected\r\nhis misapprehensions--showed him the dates, and proved that he had known\r\nfrom the first that it was probable Leopold would be proposed by France.\r\nThe proposition was made by us to Prince Frederick of Orange on November\r\n13, his final answer received on August 11 (there may be a slight error in\r\nthese dates, as I write from memory). In the meantime the King of France\r\nhad about November 29, when Leopold took leave of him, told him he would\r\npropose him. This was known here immediately, and Leopold distinctly told\r\nhe could not be heard of till our own candidate was disposed of. The\r\nregular proposal of Leopold did not arrive here till January 1, and was\r\ncommunicated to the King with the _projet_ of a protocol, for it was no\r\nmore, on the 9th.\r\n\r\nIt was still only a proposition, and the Government now come to advise the\r\nKing to consent to it.\r\n\r\nThe Duke showed the King that there had been ten candidates in all:--\r\n\r\nPrince Philip of Hesse Homburgh, Prince John of Saxony, Prince Frederick of\r\nOrange, Prince Charles of Bavaria, Prince Otho of Bavaria, the Archduke\r\nMaximilian, Prince Paul of Wurtemburgh, Prince Leopold, Prince Emilius of\r\nHesse Darmstadt, and Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh.\r\n\r\nThe seven first either declined or were rejected. Prince Emilius of Hesse\r\nDarmstadt was an aide-de-camp of Bonaparte, and the King would not have\r\nhim, and with regard to the last, Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh, the Duke\r\nshowed the King he was much more nearly connected with Prussia, and so with\r\nRussia, than with England. The King admitted this, and seemed to have been\r\nbrought into good humour, when he became so ill that he was obliged to beg\r\nthe Duke to leave him, and soon after sent him word he would see him in two\r\ndays. The Duke says he was really unwell, and in fact was taking physic all\r\nthe time he was with him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke showed the King that _he alone_ had not the power of nomination.\r\nHe had one voice out of three, and there were ten candidates.\r\n\r\n'At any rate,' said the King, 'Claremont reverts to the Crown.' The Duke,\r\nfearing he might wish to give it to the Duke of Cumberland, or somebody,\r\nasked the Chancellor to-day to look at the Act of Parliament and tell us\r\nwhat becomes of Claremont in the event of Leopold's being made King of\r\nGreece. The Chancellor looked and thought Claremont would certainly remain\r\nto Leopold, and if he died or gave it up go, not to the Crown, that is, not\r\nto the King, but, by specific enactment, become a portion of the revenue\r\nunder the Woods and Forests. Of course Leopold will give up Claremont,\r\nwhich is in fact a source of expense. The Duke said Leopold would be at\r\nleast innocuous, and he might be of use. The King asked how we could be\r\nsuch fools as to think he would be of any use.\r\n\r\nWhile the Duke was with the King the Duke of Cumberland was with Lady\r\nConyngham, and told her, amongst other things, that the 'Times' was the\r\nDuke of Wellington's paper.\r\n\r\nThe 'Morning Journal' is _his_ paper, and uses the expressions he puts into\r\nthe King's mouth.\r\n\r\nAberdeen says Leopold is quite aware of all he will have to go through.\r\n\r\nHe has written to Lord Stuart to ascertain whether there is any truth in\r\nthe report of his being engaged to the daughter of the Duke of Orleans.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that is so, and that the French proposition\r\noriginates in that.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 16._\r\n\r\nRead last night a very interesting report by Captain Wade of his mission to\r\nRunjeet Singh in 1827.\r\n\r\nReceived a box from the Duke with a circular note saying the King is not\r\nwell enough to see him before Tuesday. He has seen no one since he saw the\r\nDuke, and the Duke hears he was not mistaken in his judgment of the effect\r\nhe thought he had produced upon the King's mind; so I suppose this matter,\r\nwhich looked threatening at first, may be considered as settled, although\r\nnot yet formally terminated.\r\n\r\nThe King will, I dare say, make another plunge when he finds Claremont will\r\nnot be at his personal disposal, as he seems to have imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 19._\r\n\r\nRead all day Sir Thomas Munro's Life, which contains a great deal of\r\ninteresting and valuable information. He was a very great man.\r\n\r\nTalked to Hardinge of various matters. He was at Stowe when Lord Chandos in\r\nthe middle of the night received a note from his father, communicating one\r\nfrom Sir. W. Fremantle, which informed him that the King was going to turn\r\nus all to the right about. Lord Chandos said to Hardinge he would never\r\nbelong to a Government of which the Duke of Wellington was not a member.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 19._\r\n\r\nRead the rest of the 'Life of Sir Thomas Munro,' a most valuable book. I\r\nbelieve there are no books so really useful as the lives of great and good\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in town, found a note from Hardinge, who thinks the despatch\r\nas to watching the Russians and navigating the Indus quite perfect.\r\n\r\nThe Duke went to-day to Windsor. About eight he sent round a box containing\r\na note, saying that the King consented to Prince Leopold's being King of\r\nGreece. So for the present, at least, we are safe again. I never had much\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 20._\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner. Lord Bathurst not there. We had very little talk upon\r\npublic matters. The Duke had a bad cold. The opinion seemed to be that the\r\npress of the session would be upon domestic matters, for the reduction of\r\nestablishments and taxation.\r\n\r\nThe King wrote to the Duke and _grumpily acceded_ to Leopold's appointment.\r\nLeopold is very _uppish_ upon the subject. He was at Cobham to-day and\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nI am to see Peel on Sunday at half-past one on Indian matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 22._\r\n\r\nAt one, Privy Council to consider the petition of the E. I. C. for the\r\nrecall of Sir J. P. Grant. The Lord President, Lord Chief Baron, and Lord\r\nChief Justice of Common Pleas present. The committee reported that they did\r\nnot consider themselves warranted at present in advising Sir J. P. Grant's\r\nremoval, but they thought it right he should be directed to proceed home\r\nthat the several matters objected to him might be investigated.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity of the presence of two judges to get a legal opinion\r\nas to Sir J. Malcolm's conduct in resisting the service of the Habeas\r\nCorpus _ad testificandum_.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity likewise of laying before the two judges the change\r\nof circumstances since the institution of the Supreme Court, and the\r\npresent reasons for making their jurisdiction without the limits of the\r\nPresidency the exception and not the rule.\r\n\r\nThe judges seemed to enter into my view. The Lord Chief Baron suggested\r\nthat there might be a previous enquiry before the Country Court, which\r\nmight for that purpose be a sort of grand jury. [Footnote: _I.e._ when the\r\ncase was to be transferred to the Supreme Court.]\r\n\r\nLord Hill showed me a letter from Sir F. Watson addressed to Sir B. Taylor,\r\nas the King's first aide-de-camp, and directing him as such, by the King's\r\ncommand, to intimate to Lord Hill the pleasure it would give His Majesty to\r\nknow that Lord Hill had given Captain Scarlett, the son of the Attorney-\r\nGeneral, an opportunity of purchasing a majority. Captain Scarlett is a\r\nvery young captain--and Lord Hill feels the thing asked cannot be done. He\r\nwas going to see the Duke of Wellington about it. Not very long ago the\r\nKing gave away a regiment without asking Lord Hill--however, that was\r\nsettled; but it is clear that, unless Lord Hill is allowed to exercise the\r\nfair patronage of his office, he will resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 26._\r\n\r\nCabinet. It seems the French have acceded to the proposals of the Pasha of\r\nEgypt, and finding 50,000 men would be required to take Algiers, prefer his\r\noperating with 40,000 of his own. He pretends to have made arrangements\r\nwhich will secure an easy conquest, and promises to place Tunis, Tripoli,\r\nand Algiers under regular governments, nominally under the Sultan, whose\r\nconsent he reckons upon, and capable of preserving the relations of peace\r\nwith other Mediterranean Powers.\r\n\r\nThe Pasha's army is commanded by French officers, and the annexation of\r\nthese States to Egypt would be their practical annexation to France. When\r\nhis army is disseminated along the coast of Africa, I might realise my\r\ndream of taking Egypt from India.\r\n\r\nWe considered the proposed order in Council relative to the slave\r\nregulations of the King's own ceded colonies. The Duke was evidently not\r\nwell, and he was rather out of humour. We were three hours and a half in\r\nCabinet. He made various objections to the proposed regulations. He\r\nimpressed upon us the danger of tampering with the rights of property. We\r\nwere doing that with property of an _odious_ character, which we should not\r\ndo in England. He pressed the effect in the West Indies and the example\r\neverywhere. He seemed to complain that the regulations were different from\r\nthose agreed to in the summer. Sir G. Murray was very quiet. He is a very\r\nsensible man, but he is overawed by the Duke, having been under him so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nPoor old Tierney is dead, for which I am very sorry. He was a very good\r\nfriend of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 27._\r\n\r\nCabinet at four. There can be no Council to-morrow, as Greville has the\r\ngout and Buller is in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThere is to be an intimation sent to the Pasha to the effect that we\r\n_disapprove_ of the proposed attempt to conquer Tripoli, Tunis, and\r\nAlgiers. France is to be told the same. I wished conditional orders to be\r\ngiven to the Fleet, and that the Pasha should be told orders had been\r\ngiven. It being doubtful whether French vessels might not convoy the\r\nEgyptian fleet and transports, I thought we had better now consider what we\r\nshould do in that event; that we had better not threaten without\r\ndetermining to execute our threat, and that we should consider how we\r\nshould deal with the French ships if we stopped the Egyptian--in short not\r\ntake a first step which might make a second necessary, without knowing in\r\nour own minds what that second step should be. The Duke thinks the French\r\nwill back out when they know our _disapprobation_, and that at any rate the\r\nPasha would. I rather doubt this of either of them.\r\n\r\nThe French say they have a sort of quarrel with Tripoli, but none with\r\nTunis, and they enter into a scheme for conquering both as stepping-stones\r\nto Algiers. Tunis in their hands would be more dangerous than Algiers.\r\n\r\nHardinge told me he had had a long conversation with Peel the other day on\r\nthe state of the country. He thought Peel seemed to have apprehensions, and\r\nto think that if the King, through some intrigue of the Brunswickers, got\r\nrid of the Duke, things would go very ill indeed; that the authority of the\r\nDuke alone kept things quiet. England is in a bad state, because the\r\ncountry gentlemen have ill-paid rents; but Scotland and Ireland do very\r\nwell, and the trade of the country is not depressed.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at the Chancellor's. The Duke of Montrose there, as it was\r\nto have been a dinner for the sheriffs. I told the Duke of my notion of\r\naltering the law of succession to property in India, and enabling all\r\nexisting proprietors to leave their estates as they please.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 28._\r\n\r\nThe 'Times' publishes my letter to Malcolm to-day, with comments.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole I am glad the letter has been published. I think no one can\r\nread it without seeing I am actuated only by public views, and that I am\r\ndetermined to do my duty.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the 'Courier' called at the Indian Board and saw Bankes, and\r\nasked whether he should say anything. Bankes said he would see me before he\r\ngave an answer. I do not care about the publication, and the letter will\r\ndefend itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 29._\r\n\r\nChairs have received very bad accounts of the temper of the Madras army,\r\nwhich has no cause of complaint. Lord W. Bentinck has been at last obliged\r\nto lay his hand upon the press, and, as might have been expected, is much\r\nmore abused than if he had done so at first. The Radicals had begun to\r\nconsider him one of themselves, and so think him a traitor when he refuses\r\nto go any further with them.\r\n\r\nI went to the Duke and told him what they said. He is, as usual, sanguine,\r\nand thinks it will blow over.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke I thought he had better look out for a Governor-General,\r\nfor it might be necessary to recall Lord W. Bentinck. The objection to\r\nmaking Malcolm provisional successor is that he would stay till he died in\r\norder to be Governor-General one day. Otherwise his provisional appointment\r\nwould strengthen the local Government very much.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet they had all read my letter in the 'Times,' except the\r\nChancellor. I told him to read it.\r\n\r\nPeel was indignant at the publication. Lord Rosslyn said Joseph Hume had\r\nhad the letter some time in his possession, and must have sent it to the\r\n'Times.'\r\n\r\nPeel said it was a very good letter. I said I was not ashamed of it.\r\n\r\nThey all laughed very much at the simile of the elephants.\r\n\r\nCabinet. Much discussion as to the terms of the speech. Aberdeen's part was\r\nvery ill done indeed. It underwent much alteration and was improved. That\r\nregarding distress and remedies was postponed. There is no remedy, and it\r\nis best to say so.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the export of almost all manufactures is increased largely\r\nin quantity, but the value is diminished. Still this proves continued and\r\nincreased employment, although at low wages. This is a state of things in\r\nwhich we cannot try to make corn dearer or wool either. Nothing but the\r\nextreme cheapness of our manufactures makes their export possible.\r\n\r\nAberdeen read his letter to Consul Barker respecting the. Pasha's designs.\r\nThe last paragraph, which intimated that the Pasha's persistence 'would too\r\nprobably lead to our decided opposition,' was omitted. It was thought that\r\nthe recommendation, 'to weigh well the serious consequences of a measure\r\nhighly objectionable to us, and to which other Powers could not but be\r\nunfavourable,' was thought sufficient to stop the Pasha.\r\n\r\nIf the first words had stood, we must have used the same to France, and the\r\nthreat might have led to collision. In any case the Pasha would have\r\ncommunicated the expressions to France.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and the Chancellor were to see Leopold to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAnother Cabinet to-morrow at four for going on with the Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 30._\r\n\r\nHardinge called. He told me all was not settled as to Lord Chandos having\r\nthe Mint. He referred to the Duke of Buckingham, [Footnote: He had, as\r\nappears from the Wellington correspondence, pressed for years his claims to\r\na seat in the Cabinet, with an importunity to which the Duke of Wellington\r\nexpressed his objection. His large parliamentary interest, which almost\r\nmade him the chief of a party of his own, made him appear entitled to\r\nexpect it.] who would rather have it himself, with a seat in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nLord MountCharles goes out to annoy his father, and force him to give him a\r\nlarger allowance, unaccompanied by the condition of constant attendance in\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nRead the Duke of Northumberland's letter to Peel on the state of Ireland.\r\nThe Duke represents the Catholic Relief Bill as having produced none of the\r\nevils anticipated by its opposers, if it has not produced all the benefits\r\nexpected by its supporters--as having upon the whole worked better than\r\ncould have been expected in so short a time and under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances he thinks confined to the counties of Tipperary, Clare,\r\nand Roscommon; in the first produced by too high rents; in the second by\r\nlate collision and the want of proper management on the part of the\r\ngentlemen; in the last by attempts to convert the Catholics, and the zeal\r\nof new converts. The Catholic Union is dissolved. The great body of the\r\nCatholics have abstained from the ostentation of triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, February 1._\r\n\r\nBankes called this morning, but I did not see him. He saw Henry. He came to\r\nsay he was out, and S. Wortley in his place. When he understood Lord\r\nChandos did not take the Mint, he went to the Duke and offered to remain,\r\nthinking his going out, with Lord Chandos's declining to come in, might,\r\ntaken together, embarrass the Government. However, the arrangement was\r\nalready made.\r\n\r\nRead Lushington's minute on the Neilgherry hills. He wants to make an\r\nEnglish colony there. If he had, every man would make some excuse, desert\r\nhis duty in the hot months, and go to the Neilgherry hills.\r\n\r\nRead the first volume of Gamba's 'Travels in South Russia.' He was Consul\r\nof France, but writes like a Russian. He talks of restoring the commercial\r\ncommunication with Asia by the Phasis, Caspian, and Oxus. All this is\r\nabsurd. Unless indeed the Russians, after occupying China, turn the Oxus\r\ninto its old course, and thus enable themselves to carry goods by water\r\ncarriage to the foot of the Himalaya, or rather within 250 miles of Cabul.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 5._\r\n\r\nReceived last night a note from the Duke asking me, if I could, to have a\r\nCabinet to-day on Batta. If I could not, to send Peel the letters of\r\nMalcolm, &c.\r\n\r\nI determined to have the Cabinet. Peel had not read till the day before\r\nyesterday the Batta papers, and, although inclining to the opinion that the\r\npresent orders must be maintained, he thinks it, as it is, a serious\r\nquestion for the Government to decide after the minutes of Lord William\r\nBentinck and the members of council, with the apprehension of a mutiny as\r\nthe possible result of our standing firm. I said if we gave way the other\r\narmies would bring forward their demands--that it was a question, not only\r\nbetween the Home Authorities and the army, but the Home Authorities and the\r\nLocal Government which had for sixteen years resisted the orders sent to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Duke cautioned the Cabinet as to the character of the Indian army,\r\nwhich he said was a _mercenary army_, retained in obedience by nothing but\r\nthe wish to return to England; but he thought after what had taken place we\r\nmust resist, and adhere to our present orders. Peel wished all the members\r\nof the Cabinet to read the minutes before they decided, and there is to be\r\na Cabinet on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that if a question should be asked to-night, Peel should\r\nsay 'the orders had not been countermanded.' Peel observed very justly on\r\nthe state of things which seemed to exist in India. An army sending such\r\nmemorials to the Government, and the members of the Government writing\r\npamphlets against each other. In point of fact, years will be required to\r\nrestore a proper tone to the Government of India.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to the Duke the mission of two Russian Poles to India and\r\nManilla, and that I suspected Russia of a wish to purchase Manilla. Neither\r\nthe Duke nor Aberdeen seemed to think the Spaniards would or could sell the\r\nPhilippines. However, Aberdeen will write to the man at Madrid to find out\r\nwhether any proposal to that effect has been made by the Russian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House of Commons consider their majority last night\r\nfortunate. The House is very loose. In the majority and minority were the\r\nmost opposite parties. O'Connell went out with Sadler. The Brunswickers are\r\nin high glee, and have sent for their valiant champion, Falmouth. In our\r\nHouse they made a poor show.\r\n\r\nPrince Leopold is not by any means disposed to take Greece without Candia,\r\nand it was thought, from Lord Lansdowne's speech, he and others had advised\r\nhim to take this line. Aberdeen is very much embarrassed to find a\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 6._\r\n\r\nSpring-Rice asked Bankes in the House last night whether the letter to Sir\r\nJ. Malcolm published as mine was mine. Bankes said that I had no copy of\r\nit, and therefore could not say it was correctly given. It was a private\r\nletter. Brougham, and Mackintosh, and that ass, M. A. Taylor, spoke in\r\nreprobation of it. Mackintosh most unfairly and disingenuously pretended to\r\nunderstand I endeavoured to get off by saying it was a private letter, and\r\nsaid it would be an extenuation of my offence if I would disavow the\r\nsentiments contained in it. What must he be himself to suppose I would\r\ndisavow what I had written! Upon the whole, the tone taken by Peel and\r\nBankes, but more especially by Peel, was too apologetical. I shall be\r\nobliged to go to the House on Monday to have a question put to me by Lord\r\nLansdowne. I shall distinctly declare he may consider the letter as mine,\r\nand that I am ready to defend every line of it. Wrote to Lord Wellesley to\r\noffer to put his name upon the Committee on East India affairs if he would\r\nattend. He declines on account of ill-health.\r\n\r\nReceived a note from Peel begging me to have the Chairs to meet him on the\r\nappointment of the committee. I sent to the Chairman, and he came and met\r\nPeel; but Astell was out of the way. We are to meet at half-past one to-\r\nmorrow. Peel did not seem to have looked much into the subject, which the\r\nChairman observed.\r\n\r\nSaw Bankes. He is not certain of succeeding now to the secretaryship of the\r\nAdmiralty, but he expects it ultimately. He thinks the Duke of Buckingham\r\nhad nothing to do with Lord Chandos's rejection of the Mint: but does not\r\nknow how it went off. He thought that Lord Chandos had accepted, and the\r\nDuke seems to have thought so too.\r\n\r\nA very good account from Ireland. The country gradually and quietly coming\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, February 7._\r\n\r\nCabinet. First, Batta. The Duke gave his decided opinion in favour of\r\nadhering to the present order. After some conversation, but no opposition,\r\nthe Cabinet acquiesced unanimously in that decision, which has been mine\r\nfrom the first.\r\n\r\nI had a moment's conversation with Peel about the letter to Sir J. Malcolm,\r\nand told him I would defend every word of it, elephants and all.\r\n\r\nThen we had a good deal of discussion respecting the policy to be pursued\r\nwith regard to Cuba, against which the Mexicans are preparing to organise a\r\nslave insurrection, for which purpose they have sent a Minister to Hayti.\r\nIt seems to be generally believed that Canning, about the year 1823, issued\r\na sort of prohibition to the Mexican and Columbian States to attack Cuba,\r\nbut no trace can be found in the Foreign Office of any such prohibition.\r\n\r\nSir R. Wilson means to ask a question upon the subject to-morrow. He says,\r\nif you prohibit the Mexicans and Columbians from attacking Cuba, you should\r\nprohibit the Spaniards from attacking them--which is fair--in fact the\r\nexpedition of Barradas was undertaken before we knew anything about it, and\r\nif we had wished we could not have interfered.\r\n\r\nThe question as to what answer should be given to Sir R. Wilson, and what\r\npolicy pursued, was deferred till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it appears that Mr. Robertson, who is at Mexico,\r\nremonstrated strongly with M. de Bocaregna, respecting the objects of the\r\nembassy to Hayti, and he was told by Aberdeen that he did quite right, and\r\nthat not only ourselves but other states might view with disapprobation an\r\nattempt to excite a warfare of an uncivilised character in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe French have assembled 35,000 men to attack Algiers. They promise not to\r\nkeep it. [Footnote: This promise was repudiated by the Government of July.]\r\nThey intimate their intention of assisting Mehemet Ali with a fleet; but in\r\nthe meantime they are satisfied at Constantinople that Mehemet Ali will not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nAberdeen told Laval that we had informed the Pasha of Egypt that we should\r\nview with disapprobation his attack upon Tunis and Tripoli without the\r\nconsent of the Sultan. Laval begged this might be repeated to him three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nMuch conversation as to the state of the House of Commons. The Tories are\r\nmost radical. Sir R. Vyvyan told Holmes or Planta his object was to reduce\r\nthe Government majorities as much as possible, and to make the Government\r\nas contemptible as possible. Sir E. Knatchbull leads about twenty-three. I\r\nthink the probability is that, unless we make some coalition with the\r\nWhigs, we shall go to the ground between the two parties, [Footnote: This\r\neventually occurred on the Civil List question after the accession of\r\nWilliam IV.] both uniting against us upon some point (upon my letter to Sir\r\nJ. Malcolm as likely as any other).\r\n\r\nI took home Sir George Murray. He expressed his surprise the Duke should\r\ncling to the hope of reclaiming the ultra-Tories, whom he would not get,\r\nand who were not worth having.\r\n\r\nI confess I think he carries it on too long, although I am not surprised he\r\nshould have wished it at first.\r\n\r\nPrince Leopold has given no reply to Aberdeen's letter, or to the offer of\r\nthe ambassadors.\r\n\r\nLord Holland gives notice to-morrow of a motion about Greece, and Lord\r\nMelbourne moves for some papers respecting Portugal.\r\n\r\nLord Melville gives notice for me of the committee on East Indian Affairs,\r\nand I am not to go down till Tuesday, that we may have out the letter to\r\nMalcolm and other Indian matters all at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 8._\r\n\r\nWrote a memorandum for Peel and Bankes to this effect: 'That I had neither\r\ncopy nor recollection of the letter; but that I had no doubt the letter\r\npublished as mine was substantially correct. It was a confidential\r\nexposition of the motives which induced me to recommend two judges to the\r\nKing. [Footnote: It was suggested that with these colleagues Sir J. Grant\r\nwould be like a wild elephant between two tame ones. Alluding to the method\r\nof taming captured elephants in India.] It was never intended to be\r\npublished, nor did I expect it would be. The expressions, therefore, were\r\nunadvised, but the sentiments were and are mine, deliberately formed upon\r\nfull consideration of the official documents before me.\r\n\r\nCabinet. It appears on looking into papers of 1825 and 1826 that so far\r\nfrom our having prohibited Mexico and Columbia from making any attack upon\r\nCuba, we uniformly abstained from doing anything of the kind. The Americans\r\ndeclared they could not see with indifference any state other than Spain in\r\npossession of Cuba, and further their disposition to interpose their power\r\nshould war be conducted in Cuba in a _devastating_ manner, and with a view\r\nto the excitement of a servile war.\r\n\r\nWe offered to guarantee Cuba to Spain in 1823 if she would negotiate with\r\nthe colonies with a view to their recognition.\r\n\r\nSubsequently we were willing to enter into a tripartite guarantee of Cuba\r\nto Spain with the United States and France.\r\n\r\nThe United States seemed not unwilling, but France held back.\r\n\r\nPeel is to say there was no record of any prohibition, but that the United\r\nStates declared so, and it was possible Mr. Canning may have intimated a\r\nsimilar disposition on our part. This is to keep open to us the faculty of\r\ninterfering if we please.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks my letter does not signify one pin. The simile of the\r\nelephants evidently means no more than that an indiscreet judge was placed\r\nbetween two discreet ones.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told me he had offered a Lordship of the Treasury to Ashley, who\r\nhad declined it. He then told him to make himself master of the Batta\r\nquestion. Ashley said he had not seen the papers. He said, let him see the\r\npapers. I told him I had sent them the moment I got them to him, and he had\r\ndesired me to send them to the Cabinet room, which I did. When they were\r\ntaken from the Cabinet room they went to the India Board, and Ashley might\r\nhave seen them. I had never kept any papers from him. We then talked about\r\nthe speech to be made in moving the committee. The Duke seems inclined to\r\nhave little said. Peel seems disposed to say little; but he knows little. I\r\nthink they are wrong. I am sure it is necessary to correct the erroneous\r\nnotions which have been propagated with respect to the trade. They will\r\notherwise acquire so great a head it will be impossible to beat them back.\r\n\r\nHowever, this we are to talk over with Peel tomorrow.\r\n\r\nGeneral King, who voted against the address on Thursday, is turned out by\r\nthe King himself; the Duke having only mentioned the fact. I dare say the\r\nKing may be alarmed by the spirit shown by the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe suicide of . . . . on account of his wife's seduction by the Duke of\r\nCumberland, will drive the Duke of Cumberland out of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 9._\r\n\r\nCalled on the Duke. He advised a very narrowed statement in moving for the\r\ncommittee. I rather doubt his judgment upon this point. I fear the opinion\r\nof the country will become settled, and that when the strength of our case\r\nis brought forward it will be found unequal to the driving back of the\r\nstream. However, I made a speech as he desired. Lord Lansdowne said a few\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nLord Durham then questioned me as to the authenticity of my letter to Sir\r\nJ. Malcolm. I acknowledged it was substantially correct, and declared I\r\ncould not have entertained any other sentiments without a dereliction of\r\nduty. He expressed disapprobation, considering the letter as evincing a\r\ndetermination to control the independence of judges. The Duke replied--then\r\nLord Melville--then Lord Holland--I last. I declared that, as my father's\r\nson, I was the last man capable of harbouring a thought against the\r\nindependence of judges; but I would resist their usurpation, more\r\nespecially when they usurped powers withheld from them by Parliament as\r\ndangerous to the peace of India and to the stability of the British power.\r\n\r\nI said India could not bear the collision of the Supreme Court and the\r\nLocal Government. If we did not support the Government we should lose\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nI was determined to maintain the integrity, the dignity, the authority, and\r\nthe unapproachable power of the Local Government, and especially to support\r\na man who, at that distance from England, acting in the faithful discharge\r\nof his public duty, incurred the highest responsibility and the greatest\r\npersonal risk in defence of what he considered essential to the stability\r\nof the British power in India. I believe I did well. They all told me I\r\nshould hear no more of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 10._\r\n\r\nSaw Bankes. He says the House of Commons is loose indeed; but he thinks\r\nMinisters will have a majority on the East Retford business. The worst of\r\nit is that those who ought to be the friends of Government will not stay\r\nout a debate. Last night Peel and Goulburn were left with a decided\r\nminority, but the House was counted out.\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge. He seems to think there is no great danger, and he thinks the\r\nHouse is in so loose a state that the accession of an individual or two\r\nwould not draw others; that Brougham may be quieted, and that the others do\r\nnot much signify.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Abercromby has been made Chief Baron of Scotland. Another\r\nWhig gone. A very valuable intimation to those who remain.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne brings in Zachary Macaulay, son of the old saint. [Footnote:\r\nThe late Lord Macaulay. He is erroneously described by his father's\r\nChristian name.] They say a very clever man indeed, at least as a writer.\r\n\r\nHardinge told me the Duke told Mrs. Arbuthnot I spoke very well last night.\r\nAt dinner the Chancellor and Sir George Murray congratulated me on what had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cabinet dinner, much talk and nothing settled. The motion of Sir\r\nJ. Graham will, I think, be amended--and easily. There is a disposition,\r\nvery properly, not to give Portuguese papers. As to the Lord Holland's\r\nmotion on Friday no decision is come to.\r\n\r\nGave the Duke the petition of the Bengal half-castes.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenkins, who was for many years resident at Nagpore, called upon me and\r\noffered himself as successor to Sir J. Malcolm. He said the Chairs were\r\ndisposed to him, if the Government had no objection. I said I was aware of\r\nthe services he had rendered, but that there were many distinguished\r\nservants of the Company, and likewise persons of ability who had not been\r\nin India, whose several qualifications must be considered. It was further a\r\npoint upon which I must of course communicate with the Duke of Wellington.\r\nThe man is a person of dry cold manner, not prepossessing.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to think Mr. Chaplin the best Indian for the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 11._\r\n\r\nI think Polignac's Ministry must fall, and really, as regards himself, I\r\ncannot feel regret, as he is the greatest liar that has exercised\r\ndiplomatist functions for a long time. I had thought better of him. If\r\ntheir expedition ever sails for Algiers they will find what it costs to\r\nsend an expedition over sea. I think, however, they will succeed, and, if\r\nthey do, they will keep Algiers.\r\n\r\nSir R. Gordon entertains a very different opinion from that expressed by\r\nAberdeen as to the future fate of the Ottoman Empire. He thinks the events\r\nof the late war prove little, and that the Sultan has learnt a lesson which\r\nwill induce him to treat his rayas better--that the war once over, all men\r\nwill return to their duty. However, he gives no good reasons for his\r\nopinion. He states very fairly the difficulty of his own position. He says\r\nhe has hitherto believed it was the intention of his Government to support\r\nTurkey. He has therefore had influence, because where he has advised\r\nconcession the Turks have understood we meant it should not be hurtful to\r\nthem--but now, how can he advise the Turks to yield to what is asked, when\r\nhe knows the Government think that the more is taken from Turkey, the more\r\nis saved from Russia? Sir R. Gordon says his colleagues are by no means of\r\nopinion that the Ottoman Empire is falling, and that France allows their\r\nofficers to go in numbers to serve with the Turkish troops.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Sir J. Macdonald in which he tells me the Turkish\r\nAsiatic provinces are falling away from the Sultan.\r\n\r\nHe encloses a letter from a Mr. Sterling, giving a very interesting account\r\nof his journey by Meshed and near Balkh to Cabul. He took a new road to the\r\nnorth of the Paropamisan ridge. In Cabul he experienced no difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 12._\r\n\r\nHouse. Lord Holland's motion of a resolution that the House would not be\r\nsatisfied with any plan for the pacification and settlement of Greece,\r\nwhich did not secure to that state the means of independence by sea and\r\nland, and leave the Greeks free to have their own Constitution. His\r\ninformation was most inaccurate. Yet on this he founded his distrust of the\r\nGovernment. Notwithstanding this distrust he was neither with them nor\r\nagainst them, nor did he wish to turn them out. He made an indifferent\r\nspeech. Aberdeen a fair one ill delivered. The Duke spoke admirably. The\r\nbrains were beaten out of the motion. No division. Goderich and Clanricarde\r\nand Melbourne spoke; Lord Melbourne poorly.\r\n\r\nOn the East Retford [Footnote: It will be remembered that this question had\r\nled to the resignation of Huskinsson and his friends.] question last night\r\nwe had a majority of twenty-seven in a House of 226 members--the high\r\nTories voting with Government.\r\n\r\nBankes has now the offer of a Lordship of the Admiralty till Croker can be\r\ngot rid of; but he will not go. Castlereagh will have the Treasury\r\nLordship--that is, 600£ a year more for having been careless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 13._\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the Chairs spoke to the Duke about the Bombay succession. He\r\nasked what I meant to do with Elphinstone? I considered he had left India\r\naltogether. The Duke thought he must return--that he would go to Bombay\r\nagain with the expectation of afterwards going to Madras. I think the Duke\r\nhas an idea of making him Governor-General. I mentioned Mr. Chaplin. The\r\nDuke mentioned Mr. Jenkins, of whom he thought highly. He had done well at\r\nNagpore, and he had had some correspondence with him when in India which\r\ngave him a good opinion of him. The Duke spoke of Mr. Russell, but thought\r\nhe had been mixed up with the Hyderabad transactions. I then mentioned\r\nClare. The Duke thought him better than any of the others mentioned. That\r\nit was a great thing to have a man of rank; he must be well supported; he\r\nhad not a very strong mind. However, on the whole he seemed better than the\r\nothers, and I am to propose him.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to have Clare. I have a great respect and regard for him--\r\nbut I have a little hesitation as to his fitness. He will, however, be a\r\nmost zealous and honourable servant of the public, and his good manners\r\nwill keep people in good humour and in order.\r\n\r\nLeopold has sent in his answer. I have not seen it yet. He accepts on\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe debate last night in the Commons is considered very favourable.\r\nDawson's amendment was adopted--and Planta and Holmes say the temper of\r\nthe country gentlemen is much improved. They are quite in spirits again.\r\n\r\nA hint of Peel's, but a hint that the Government did not fear an appeal to\r\nthe country, seems to have had a good effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 14._\r\n\r\nCabinet. On Thursday Peel, in opening the Compensation Bill, will detail\r\nthe various legal reforms.\r\n\r\nHe is disposed to diminish gradually the number of crimes for which the\r\npunishment of death is awarded. The Duke seemed reluctant and so did\r\nothers. However, the Chancellor did not object.\r\n\r\nMy father considered that where a man could not protect his own property\r\nthe law ought to protect it for him by higher penalties. However, now it\r\nseems a man must protect his own property, and punishments are to be\r\nproportioned more to the extent of the moral offence than to the necessity\r\nfor preventing crime.\r\n\r\nThen we considered Leopold's answer. The man accepts provided--\r\n\r\n1. There is a guarantee of the new State.\r\n\r\n2. That the frontier is slightly altered.\r\n\r\n3. That the three powers protect the present insurgents in Samos and\r\nCandia.\r\n\r\n4. That a loan of 1,500,000£ is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n5. That he may have troops furnished to him.\r\n\r\n6. He stipulates that the Greeks should have the power of declining him,\r\n_le soussigné_, as their Prince.\r\n\r\nA guarantee there will probably be, and therefore the alteration of\r\nboundaries, which Leopold knew could not be listened to, is in fact\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nEach power separately and individually may use its good offices with the\r\nPorte for the protection of the Greeks in Samos and Candia, and indeed,\r\nunder the agreement as to an amnesty, each would be bound to do so; but no\r\ntriple agreement will be entered into, the object being to get out of the\r\nTreaty of July 6.\r\n\r\nAberdeen seemed disposed to allow 1,000 men of each of the three Powers to\r\ngo to Greece. This would continue the triple action, and as these troops\r\nwould go, not against any external enemy, but against Greeks, the measure\r\nwould be somewhat in contradiction to the declaration the other night that\r\nthe Greeks and their Prince might make what Government they pleased. After\r\nsome conversation it seemed the general opinion that it would be better to\r\npay the cost of the troops than to have our own there, and in fact the same\r\nmoney would enable Greece to have twice the number of Germans or Swiss that\r\nshe could have of British. This I thought. But I suggested that Greece\r\ncould not want a large sum down. A sum might be required for outfit, but\r\nthen an annual sum. Peel proposed the whole loan guaranteed should be\r\n700,000£, of which 100,000£ to be paid down as outfit, and then 100,000£ a\r\nyear for six years at 5 per cent; the three Powers guaranteeing each a\r\nthird part of the interest. It is better to guarantee the loan, then to pay\r\nmoney down. The loan, they say, can be made at three. Aberdeen says the\r\nGreeks give a most flourishing exposé of their future finances, and he\r\nthinks they will become a rich State, and the Powers be exposed to no\r\ndanger of being called upon for the payment of the interest. I think he\r\nbegins to love his Greek progeny.\r\n\r\nThe Duke only desired we would get out of the treaty. I suggested the\r\ninexpediency of our joining in the guarantee. A guarantee gave no right of\r\nintervention we should not otherwise possess, and it obliged us to\r\ninterfere when we might not desire to do so. However, I fear there will be\r\na guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 16._\r\n\r\nCabinet. There seems to be little doubt that the Emperor Pedro means to\r\ndirect an expedition from Rio against Portugal, Terceira being the point of\r\n_rassemblement_. This is a practical answer to the question recently put by\r\nus conjointly with France and Austria as to the intentions of the Emperor,\r\nand therefore we are at liberty to act as if a specific answer had been\r\nreceived. It seems Austria will be very unwilling to recognise Don Miguel;\r\nFrance not.\r\n\r\nThe object of recognising him is to prevent a revolutionary war in Portugal\r\nand the entrance of Spanish troops into Portugal to oppose it.\r\n\r\nWhenever Miguel is recognised, I think Lord Rosslyn will be made Master-\r\nGeneral of the Ordnance, Lord Beresford going to Portugal as Minister, and\r\nthen the Privy Seal will be disposable. I dare say the Duke, out of good\r\nnature, will offer it to Lord Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nAberdeen read the remonstrance he proposed sending to Spain against the\r\nproposed expedition to Mexico.\r\n\r\nLeopold met the Plenipotentiaries, and Aberdeen thinks he would have\r\nacceded, but he evidently required the sanction of another person. The\r\nFrench Ambassador used very strong language, telling him his Court would be\r\nvery much hurt indeed at finding him make these difficulties after all that\r\nhad passed, &c.\r\n\r\nPeel told me he was disposed to grant the motion for any correspondence\r\nbetween the Board of Control or any member of it, &c., with a direct\r\nnegative. To move the previous question was an admission of some error. I\r\nwas telling him the circumstances when it was necessary to attend to\r\nAberdeen's business. I must tell him to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 17._\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet dinner at Lord Melville's, talked to Peel and gave him a\r\ncopy of the report of the Privy Council and of my letter to Sir J. Grant.\r\nHe is disposed to take a high tone, and thinks men will follow him better\r\nwhen he does than when he temporises. I am sure they will.\r\n\r\nHe says he would reduce everything so low as not to be beat upon\r\nestablishments. If he is beat upon unimportant questions he does not care,\r\nand will not go out. They will not get a majority for stopping supplies,\r\nand if they can agree upon motions, he is prepared to play the game of '83\r\n[Footnote: Alluding to Pitt's course at the beginning of his first\r\nMinistry. He retained office a whole Session in spite of the motions\r\ncarried against him, and in the general election of 1784 obtained an\r\noverwhelming majority.] with them. I am sure he is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 18._\r\n\r\nHouse. First a question from Lord Holland whether the orders to the Admiral\r\nrespecting Greek slaves, &c., would, after the settlement of Greece, apply\r\nto Candiot Greeks. Then Lord Melbourne's motion for Portuguese papers. He\r\ndid not speak well--but very bitterly. Goderich spoke pathetically against\r\nthe Terceira affair--Lord Wharncliffe well with us--Lansdowne wide and\r\nloose--the Duke very excellent--Aberdeen worse than usual, and very\r\nimprudent, abusing Miguel and making awkward admissions.\r\n\r\nIt was quite established that Canning had nothing to say to the Portuguese\r\nConstitution, and I think we shall hear no more of Terceira. Fifty-two to\r\ntwenty-one--no proxies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 19._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Leopold's answer. He wants troops and money. After long talk it\r\nwas resolved the French troops might stay a year, till he could raise\r\nothers, and money should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 20, 1830._\r\n\r\nIn riding with Lord Rosslyn had a long conversation with him upon Indian\r\nmatters. He had just been reading the despatches from Lord Stuart and Lord\r\nHeytesbury upon these subjects. I told him I had anticipated all Lord H.\r\nsuggested and had done, I really thought, all that could be done. I am to\r\nsend him the secret letter. He thinks, as I do, that Aberdeen is in a great\r\nhurry to get rid of the Greek question, and disposed to incur future\r\nembarrassments to avoid present inconvenience.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn does not much like the division of last night, but I believe\r\nit was a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 21._\r\n\r\nThis morning looked through the finance accounts of the three years, ending\r\n1819, and the three ending 1828, with a view to comparing the state of the\r\ncountry with what it was before Peel's Bill. The increased consumption is\r\nastonishing. The increase of British tonnage and in the number of seamen\r\nsince 1819 is equal to the whole tonnage and to all the seamen in the\r\nforeign trade with Great Britain, although that is increased nearly in the\r\nsame proportion with our own.\r\n\r\nThe increased consumption of tea and coffee is 50 per cent. The number of\r\npounds in 1819 being about 30,000,000 of pounds, and now 45,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe import of foreign raw produce is much increased--of that produce which\r\ncompetes with the landed produce of England.\r\n\r\nHardinge called. He thinks the Government quite safe now. Indeed, he never\r\nhad much apprehension. He regrets Sir James Graham's divergence from the\r\nroad which leads to office. He thinks he came up to London intending well;\r\nbut that he thought under present circumstances he could be a more\r\nconsiderable man out of office than he would be in a subordinate situation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland says the salary of the Lord-Lieutenant may well\r\nbe reduced to 20,000£ a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 24._\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn, who called upon me at the office, thinks I may go a little\r\ntoo far in my directions with regard to Russian spies, that is, in a public\r\ndespatch. I had directed that if it appeared danger was likely to arise\r\nfrom their return to Europe or from their passage into any Asiatic country,\r\ntheir persons should be placed under restraint, and in all cases their\r\npapers and letters got possession of. He suggests that this might be\r\nmentioned in a private letter, or left to the discretion of the Local\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nWe had a long conversation on Lord Stanhope's motion for to-morrow, when\r\nWhigs and Tories are to combine to beat us.\r\n\r\nThe division last night in the House of Commons on Lord J. Russell's motion\r\nfor giving two members to Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds, was not\r\nsatisfactory. There were 140 for it, and only 188 against it. The Tories\r\nstayed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 25._\r\n\r\nHouse at 4 and until 2. Lord Stanhope's motion for a Committee of the whole\r\nHouse on the internal state of the country. He made a weak speech, because\r\nto get votes he abstained from stating the cause of distress, which in his\r\nopinion is currency, or any remedy. Goderich and Lansdowne made good\r\nspeeches. Rosebery not a bad one, though as usual pompous. All suggesting\r\nsome remedies--all for reducing taxation, but against a Committee of the\r\nHouse. Lord Radnor made a good vulgar speech. King spoke better than usual.\r\nHe proposed, but afterwards withdrew, an amendment for a Committee\r\nupstairs. The Duke, who alone spoke on our side, did not speak well, and\r\nsome of his statements were hazardous. Lords Darnley and Bute declared\r\nthere was no distress near them.\r\n\r\nWe divided well. There being but fifteen present for Lord Stanhope's\r\nmotion, and ten proxies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 26._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. Went over with them the letter on Batta.\r\n\r\nLord Wharncliffe intends on Tuesday to propose examining the Chairman of\r\nthe East Indian Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 27._\r\n\r\nWrote a note to Loch to tell him of Lord Wharncliffe's intention. He does\r\nnot like the idea at all, and wishes to see me before the Committee sits. I\r\nhave named Monday at eleven. I told him my feeling was against his being\r\nexamined, as I thought it unfair; besides, he was not the best witness. I\r\ntold Lord Wharncliffe he should examine Lord Amherst.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet room I attempted to read the papers respecting Irish\r\neducation. My opinion is that it would be better to let the matter rest for\r\nthe present; the agitation of it may revive animosities, and if any good be\r\nattainable, it may be attained at a more favourable period than the\r\npresent. I rather doubt whether it might not be yet more safely left to the\r\npeople themselves, as education in England and in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 1._\r\n\r\nCabinet. We were to have talked about Irish education, but more important\r\nmatters intervened. There is a motion on Friday of Mr. Davenport's for a\r\nCommittee on the internal state of the country. Peel thinks there will be a\r\nunion of parties in favour of it. He feels it must be opposed. Some of the\r\nfriends of Government have said they must vote for it. He proposes that\r\nGoulburn should to-morrow give notice of his intention of explaining his\r\nviews as to taxation on Monday week. Peel thinks that he can procure an\r\nadjournment of the debate till after Goulburn's exposé.\r\n\r\nGoulburn suggests taking off the whole of the beer tax, and remitting the\r\nhop duty for this year, as well as remodelling it. He likewise proposes\r\nlowering the duties on East and West India sugar, the former from 37_s_. to\r\n25_s_., and the latter from 27_s_. to 20_s_.\r\n\r\nAs the revenue is decreasing, these reductions cannot be taken from it.\r\nThere must be a commutation. This he proposes to be a modified property\r\ntax, to apply to landed property, all fixed property, and the funds as well\r\nas all offices, but not to the profits of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 2._\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been some incivility last night on the part of Sir\r\nCharles Burrell and Sir E. Knatchbull against me, with reference to my\r\nopposition to the Duke of Richmond's motion on the wool question last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 3._\r\n\r\nPeel's. Met Bankes, Graham, and Ashley. It was, after talk, agreed that the\r\npapers asked should be refused, unless in the course of the debate it\r\nshould appear that the granting of Grant's petition and the report of the\r\nPrivy Council would improve the division. I expect a regular attack upon\r\nmyself from all quarters. I would give a year of the House of Lords to be\r\nthere to throw grape-shot amongst the small lawyers.\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Read despatches relating to the expedition to Algiers, which\r\nis certainly going.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Peel's. The affair of the vacated offices becomes\r\nserious, for it seems certain that it is necessary to take the declaration\r\nagain upon any new patent, and the Board of Admiralty should have taken the\r\ndeclaration as well as Castlereagh--the Board of Control as well as me.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor continues to have no objection to reducing the salaries of\r\nthe Supreme Court Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 5._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. I got rid of them as soon as I could, as I wished to go to\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\nLoch showed me a letter from Lord William Bentinck, by which it appears\r\nthat the officers of the Cawnpore division of the army wished to have a\r\ngeneral meeting for the election of delegates to England. Sir J.\r\nWhittingham forwarded their request to Lord Combermere, highly disapproving\r\nof it. Lord Combermere directed the Adjutant-General to write a letter\r\ncoinciding with Sir J. Whittingham's opinions, and adding that he would be\r\nthe advocate of the army both in India and in England. Lord William\r\n(Bentinck) is going up the country with the _Government_ and wishes to take\r\nLord Dalhousie with him. He expects very uncivil treatment, and says the\r\ndiscontent is deep-seated. The same account is received from other\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe debate was adjourned last night. R. Grant made a speech in a moderate\r\ntone, but disingenuous. Lord Ashley spoke good stuff apparently, but Henry\r\nsays he could not hear him. Lord Graham was unembarrassed and did well; but\r\nthe 'Times' hardly gives him ten words.\r\n\r\nI sent a note to Peel to-day observing upon the disingenuousness of Grant's\r\nspeech. He told me he had been reading the papers, and saw it was no\r\nquestion of judicial independence, but of judicial aggression, and he\r\nthought the tone of the Governor who was in the right much better than that\r\nof the Judge who was in the wrong. So I hope he will make a good speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 6._\r\n\r\nRead letters from Sir J. Macdonald. They came by Constantinople. The only\r\nnews they contain is that the Russians certainly have the intention of\r\nconquering Khiva and Bokhara. This comes from Chasanes Murza. I told the\r\nDuke, who seems disposed to make it an European question.\r\n\r\nI showed the Duke a most atrocious libel on royalty which has been\r\npublished in the 'Calcutta Gazette.' If the King saw it he would recall\r\nLord William by the Sign Manual. A letter must be written immediately in\r\nthe press. It is in such a state that our Government cannot stand if it be\r\npermitted to go on uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nI asked the Duke as to taxation. He said he thought it could be done\r\nwithout income tax. To lay on income tax would be to weaken ourselves in\r\nthe opinion of all foreign Powers. Besides, it would prevent our reducing\r\nthe Four per Cents.\r\n\r\nHe calculated the loss of the beer duty at 3,500,000£. and, marine\r\ninsurance, cider, remission of hop duty, &c., would make the loss\r\n4,500,000£.\r\n\r\nTo meet this he expected\r\n\r\n                                                    £\r\n  Surplus of last year                           1,700,000\r\n  Additional from general improvement              400,000\r\n  Additional malt by reducing beer duties          500,000\r\n  Increased duty on spirits                        500,000\r\n  Reducing Four per Cents                          750,000\r\n  Savings                                        1,400,000\r\n  Ireland, soap, &c.                               450,000\r\n  Stamps                                           200,000\r\n                                                 ---------\r\n                                                 5,900,000\r\n                                                 4,500,000\r\n                                                 ---------\r\n                                                 1,400,000\r\n\r\nThere may have been more; but he spoke, and I write from memory.\r\n\r\nI told him I thought that with a diminished duty on beer and an increased\r\nduty on spirits he could not expect an increase of 500,000£ on spirits. He\r\nadmitted that was the weak point. He said he was sure we could not carry an\r\nincome tax while we had a million surplus. If we have a good harvest, I\r\nhave no doubt the increase on malt will be great; but I apprehend there\r\nmust be a repayment of beer duties, and if there should be, the loss will\r\nbe enormous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 8._\r\n\r\nSent Mr. Elphinstone a letter giving an account of the travels to the North\r\nof the Paropamisan range into Cabul.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said we really must look out for a new Governor-General. I\r\nsuggested Hardinge. He said Hardinge had not as yet station enough in the\r\nopinion of the public, in the army, or in Parliament. He wished him to be\r\nSecretary in Ireland. It would have been much better if he had gone there\r\ninstead of Lord F. Gower, and Lord P. to the War Office. To be sure, then\r\nwe should not have had the reductions Hardinge had effected. He had, as I\r\nknew, always wished Hardinge to go to Ireland.\r\n\r\nI observed that Hardinge was rising every day in public estimation, which\r\nthe Duke acknowledged, and I added that I was sure none would do the duty\r\nbetter, for he had firmness and habits of business. The Duke seems to think\r\nof Elphinstone. He said he was a very clever man. I told him I had been an\r\nhour and a half with Elphinstone last night. I told the Duke all my notions\r\nrespecting individual responsibility, members of Council, &c., and that I\r\nhad begged Elphinstone to think of them. The Duke seemed generally to\r\napprove of them. It seems Lord Wellesley never would go to Council. I do\r\nnot wonder at it; but the Duke used to tell him he was Governor-General _in\r\nCouncil_--that he ought always to go there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 10._\r\n\r\nDined with the Duke. Cabinet dinner. Only the Peers there. The others\r\ndetained by Lord Palmerston's motion on Portugal, on which there was a\r\nmajority of two to one, 150 odd to 70 something. Huskisson made a very bad\r\ndull speech. We talked about a successor to the Speaker. They seem to think\r\nhe will not resign now, as he would not get a good pension in the present\r\ntemper of the House.\r\n\r\nThe candidates are Sir J. Beckett, Littleton, G. Bankes, Wynn of course. I\r\nmentioned Frankland Lewis as a good man, which he would be. I dare say the\r\nChairs will think he should be elected unanimously.\r\n\r\nIt seems there must be a Bill of Indemnity for not taking the declaration,\r\ntwo Bishops, Chester and Oxford, not having taken it. The Duke finds he has\r\nat Dover, as Lord Warden.\r\n\r\nWe had some little conversation about the income tax, which the Duke is\r\nvery hostile to, and I am glad we shall not have it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 11._\r\n\r\nThe Russians have at last sent their reply to our expostulatory note. I\r\nhave not had time to read it. Lord Heytesbury calculates that the last war\r\ncost them 12,000,000£, but they endeavour to conceal the amount.\r\n\r\nPeel told me the House was quite excited against the Bombay judges, and\r\nthat the division fairly represented its real opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 12._\r\n\r\nThere was but one black ball in the election of Lord Clare, and the Chairs\r\nthink that was put in by mistake; no one objected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 13._\r\n\r\nRead Sir H. Parnell's pamphlet on taxation.\r\n\r\nCabinet room at two. I had only got half through the Russian answer when\r\nthe Cabinet met for the subject of taxation.\r\n\r\nI rather expected to find that the Duke had had communications with\r\nGoulburn, and that the idea of a property tax was given up. However, that\r\nseemed not to be the case. It was determined the whole beer duty should be\r\ngiven up in any case.\r\n\r\n                                                       £\r\n  The expected revenue is                          50,250,000\r\n  The expected expenditure                         47,930,000\r\n                                                   ----------\r\n           Surplus                                  2,320,000\r\n  Add by reduction of Four per Cents                  777,000\r\n  By 1_s_. 6_d_. on British,\r\n    and 2_d_. on Irish and Scotch Spirits             400,000\r\n  By stamps in Ireland                                220,000\r\n                                                    3,717,000\r\n  Deduct beer tax, £3,200,000, but the loss to\r\n  the revenue from the probable increase of malt,\r\n  calculated at                                     2,500,000\r\n                                                   ----------\r\n                                                    1,217,000\r\n  Probable increase of revenue                        450,000\r\n                                                   ----------\r\n        Sinking fund                                1,667,000\r\n\r\nThe conversion of stock into annuities is proceeding at the rate of\r\n1,000,000 pounds a month, and the increased annual charge already is\r\n250,000 pounds. Certainly to this extent the estimated three millions of\r\nsurplus might be fairly reduced; but to reduce the surplus to 1,200,000\r\npounds or 1,600,000 pounds would be an entire abandonment of the system\r\nadopted by the Finance Committee and the Government.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the members of the House of Commons were all in favour\r\nof the income tax; all the Peers against it. The Duke was strongly against\r\nit. He apprehended the reduction of establishments, and particularly the\r\npressure of the tax on men of 1,200 pounds a year, and under.\r\n\r\nIf I imposed the income tax, I would make it the means of a thorough\r\nreconciliation between the higher and lower classes. In this manner only\r\nwould it be effectual and make a strong Government.\r\n\r\nI object greatly to Goulburn's deductions from the old income tax. He\r\nexcepts _occupiers_; that is, as regards land occupiers, quite right; but\r\nhe excepts manufacturing capital and capital engaged in commerce. Now, why\r\nshould the man who has 100,000 pounds in a manufactory, and makes 10 per\r\ncent, on that sum, pay nothing, while the man who invests his 100,000\r\npounds in the funds gets only 3 1/2 per cent, and pays 5 per cent, out of\r\nthat reduced profit? The man who has a manufacturing or _commercial\r\ncapital_ is a _saving man_. He can afford to pay something to the State,\r\nand why should he not? So the lawyer who may be making 10,000 pounds a\r\nyear is to pay nothing. If he takes 5,500£. a year and becomes a judge, he\r\npays 137 pounds 10 shillings. Yet his interest is still for life.\r\n\r\nIn all this there seems to me unfairness.\r\n\r\nIf the tax be imposed as it is proposed, it will be very difficult to\r\ninclude afterwards the classes now exempted. It will be impossible to take\r\noff the tax, and whenever a tax is unpopular, those upon whom it presses\r\nwill say, 'Take it off. It is only adding 1/4 or 1/2 per cent. to the\r\nincome tax.'\r\n\r\nA real property tax is the fairest of all taxes--but an income tax is the\r\nmost unfair even when it affects all income; but when it affects the income\r\nof some who have a life interest, and not the income of others in the same\r\nsituation, it is most unfair indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is quite erroneous to suppose that those who pay an income tax are the\r\nonly persons who suffer from it. The reduction of establishments, the\r\ndiminished consumption, the increased economy in every article of\r\nexpenditure on the part of those affected by it have necessarily the effect\r\nof reducing the wages of labour. The labourer may buy some things cheaper,\r\nbut he has less wherewith to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, March 14._\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge at two. Told him how we stood as to the question of taxation.\r\nHe said he thought the income tax would be popular, but agreed with me in\r\nthinking it should be established on strictly just principles.\r\n\r\nCabinet at three. Goulburn read a new statement showing the surplus this\r\nyear, if we reduced beer and leather, and next year too. The surplus this\r\nyear is about 2 millions. Next year about 1,500,000£.\r\n\r\nThe income tax reaches the funds, and the Irish, and the parsimonious, and\r\nthe rich--so far it is good, but it likewise reaches the man of 100£ a\r\nyear. It tends to diminution of establishments, to diminished demand for\r\nlabour. To create an alteration in demand generally.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to exempt professions and trades. This was unjust, and it\r\nwould have led to an entire separation and hostility between the landed\r\nproprietors and the united body of labourers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThese last would have joined on all occasions in urging a further and still\r\na further increase of income tax, and would never have consented to a tax\r\non consumption. The income tax would finally absorb all other taxes.\r\n\r\nAnother great objection to the income tax now is that it would have the\r\neffect of perilling the reduction of the 3 per cents.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, Rosslyn, and I were decidedly against income tax. Lord Bathurst\r\nand Lord Melville, as well as the Chancellor, less decidedly so, but still\r\nin favour of abiding by the reduction of the beer and leather tax. Aberdeen\r\nsaid nothing, neither did Sir G. Murray, so they were understood to go with\r\nthe majority.\r\n\r\nGoulburn acknowledged the discussion had to a great extent changed his\r\nopinion, and that he was not then prepared to propose the tax.\r\n\r\nHerries seemed much in its favour; but more, as it seemed to me, because he\r\nwished to maintain a large surplus according to the decision of the Finance\r\nCommittee than for any good reason. Peel was decidedly for a property tax.\r\nHe wished to reach such men as Baring, his father, Rothschild, and others,\r\nas well as absentees and Ireland. He thought too it was expedient to\r\nreconcile the lower with the higher classes, and to diminish the burthen of\r\ntaxation on the poor man. I accede to the principle; but I doubt whether\r\ntaxes on consumption do really press more heavily on the poor man than an\r\nincome tax. What he has to look to is not the actual price of the article\r\nhe wants, but the proportion which his wages bear to that price. It matters\r\nlittle to him what the price of candles may be, if he has not money\r\nwherewith to purchase them. That system of taxation is best for the poor\r\nman which most tends to increase the funds for the employment of labour;\r\nand every disturbance in the system, every alteration of demand, does\r\nintrinsic mischief.\r\n\r\nAfter this matter was decided, Peel behaving most fairly, and declaring he\r\nwould support the decision of the Cabinet whatever it might be, and that in\r\nthis case the decision of the Treasury was to be principally looked to, we\r\ntalked of Queen Donna Maria, in whose name Don Pedro has established a\r\nRegency in Terceira.\r\n\r\nI read Leopold's letter to Lord Aberdeen, in which he refers to his letter\r\nof February 11, for the statement of his views in taking the Greek coronet,\r\nsaying that he only acceded from courtesy, and as a matter of form, to the\r\nprotocol, and further urging some alteration in the frontier. He has made\r\nan application for a joint guarantee by the three Powers of a loan of\r\n60,000,000 paras, or 2,400,000£. Now we only agreed to guarantee 50,000£ a\r\nyear, and that for troops. Nothing will be said upon this point till he has\r\nwithdrawn his letter. He seems to be Aberdeen's pet. I do not think, had\r\nthe Greeks searched Europe, they could have found a man whose character was\r\nmore congenial to their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 17._\r\n\r\nLeopold has withdrawn his obnoxious letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 18._\r\n\r\nHouse at five. Debate on the Duke of Richmond's motion for a select\r\nCommittee on the state of the labouring classes, and the effect of taxation\r\nupon the productive powers of industry.\r\n\r\nA most dull debate, till Lord Holland spoke. I answered him. Lord Lansdowne\r\nnext, then the Duke. I spoke, showing the impracticability of the\r\nCommittee. I however showed up Committees rather too much. This Lord\r\nLansdowne took hold of, not very fairly, but he did it well.\r\n\r\nWe had in the House 69; they 39.\r\n\r\nWith proxies we had 140 to 61. My uncle voted in the minority, and so did\r\nCoplestone. Dudley, Lord Malmesbury, Lord Gower, voted with us.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, Brunswickers, and Canningites were in the minority. The Duke of\r\nCumberland was there.\r\n\r\nI find we have some recruits--in proxies Lord Lauderdale, Duke of Bedford,\r\nDownshire, Lord Wilton; and Lord Jersey sits behind us. He has now Lord\r\nLauderdale's proxy. All this is consequent upon Lord Rosslyn's accession.\r\nLord Grey has now no one left. No one expressed a wish to turn out the\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 19._\r\n\r\nIt seems that in the House of Commons Huskisson made a friendly speech,\r\nfinding he can do no harm, and Lord Althorp a very friendly one. In short,\r\neverybody seems to be of opinion that the worst thing that could be done\r\nwould be to turn out the Government.\r\n\r\nPeel says, and so does Herries, that the House is in favour of an income\r\ntax. That what we have determined upon is the best for this year, but that\r\nnext year there must be an income tax.\r\n\r\nCabinet. Leopold wants more money. It was agreed he should have 70,000\r\npounds a year loan guaranteed to him for seven years, instead of 50,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe holders of 4 per cents. are to have the option of 100 pounds stock 3\r\n1/2, or 70 pounds stock 5 per cents. Trustees may only convert into the 3\r\n1/2 per cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 20._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. They have made some alterations in the letter to the Indian\r\nGovernment respecting their conduct, and have praised Lord William for his\r\n_perseverance_, &c. This is contrary to the Duke's view and to mine. I\r\nshall see whether I can allow their amendments.\r\n\r\nI find they have likewise altered much in the letter relative to Batta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 23._\r\n\r\nThe Duke, Lord Bathurst, and Rosslyn went away at 2 to the Cabinet, where\r\nthey decided against the Jew Relief Bill. The bishops have intimated that\r\nthey must unanimously oppose it.\r\n\r\nDebate on Lord Clanricarde's motion on the eternal Terceira question. The\r\nDuke spoke very well. The House was flat. The division with proxies 126 to\r\n31, 4 to 1. We have now of Whig proxies Bedford, Lauderdale, Wilton,\r\nDownshire, Belhaven, Meldrum, and Lord Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 24._\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Sir J. Murray's. Considered what course should be adopted\r\nupon P. Thompson's motion for a committee to revise taxation. Peel still\r\nhankers after the property tax, and rather unwillingly opposes this motion.\r\nHowever, it will be done on the ground that the remission of such a\r\nquestion to a committee would derange, by existing apprehensions and hopes,\r\nthe whole industry of the country. In fact it would likewise vest the\r\nGovernment in the committee. Peel, Planta, and Holmes all think the\r\ndivision will be close. I do not apprehend that, if the debate be well\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation with the Duke upon Indian matters. The\r\nrecollections of his youth are strong upon him, and he still clings to the\r\nold forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 25._\r\n\r\nRead some evidence before the Commons on the China trade.\r\n\r\nCommittee. Examined Mr. Elphinstone. He gave very good evidence.\r\n\r\nHouse. A flat discussion on the Kentish petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 26._\r\n\r\nWe had two to one last night. The House not very full. It seemed by no\r\nmeans the wish of the House to have a property tax; quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. Elphinstone re-examined by Lord Lansdowne and others. He gave a very\r\ngood evidence, and quite knocked up colonisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, March 29, 1830._\r\n\r\nOffice at 2. Looked over regulations, &c., relative to the half-castes and\r\nconsidered their question. Came to a decided opinion against their\r\nadmissibility to offices which can be held by natives.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Carlisle presented the petition I said very little, expressed\r\ncompassion for their situation, and a wish to relieve it in any manner\r\nconsistent with the conservation of our empire and the well-being of the\r\ngreat body of the native population. I said what they asked was not\r\nequality of rights, but privilege.\r\n\r\nLord King's resolutions on the Corn Laws. A dull debate which lasted till\r\nnine--no division. The Duke did not speak well, and it was unnecessary for\r\nhim to speak at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 30._\r\n\r\nCommittee. Examined Mr. Chaplin, who gave a very good evidence. He is\r\ndecidedly against the employment of half-castes.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke at the Committee that I had written to the King immediately\r\non Clare's appointment, and afterwards to Sir F. Watson, when I sent the\r\nwarrant and had got no answer. The Duke said he would enquire about it. He\r\nthought he should have spoken to the King _before_. However, he would\r\nsettle it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 31._\r\n\r\nCommittee at 1. Examined Mr. Ricketts, the half-caste, when Lord Carlisle\r\nhad examined him in chief. Mr. Ricketts did not seem to know much about the\r\nlaw. It was odd enough to observe him looking round to me after every\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nWe had afterwards Mr. Baker, a strong contrast indeed with Mr. Ricketts. He\r\ngave very curious evidence relative to the trade of the Arabs of Malabar\r\nwith Scinde, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 2._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Question whether the French should be allowed to hire 9,000 tons\r\nof transports now in the river for the expedition against Algiers. The Duke\r\nwas strongly against it. The French had behaved so ill to us, concealing\r\ntheir objects from us, and revealing them to other Courts, besides\r\nintriguing with the Pasha of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAberdeen was for giving the permission. He thought the French would\r\nconsider it quite a hostile measure if we refused permission. However,\r\npermission will not be given.\r\n\r\nLeopold is still negotiating about the money, and it seems doubtful whether\r\nhe will not resign at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 3._\r\n\r\nThe Company have got into an awkward scrape. It seems they have not made\r\nout their account of the prime cost of their tea as merchants do, that they\r\nhave charged all losses whether from fixed rate of exchange or other\r\ncauses, whereas merchants in general state prime cost on a calculation of\r\nthe price in the place where the article is purchased, the other\r\ncalculations going in diminution of profit.\r\n\r\nI begin to think the maintenance of the monopoly will be impossible. I have\r\nlong thought it very inexpedient. It would leave a sullen, settled feeling\r\nof discontent in the minds of the manufacturers and merchants of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 6._\r\n\r\nWrote to the Duke to tell him I had not yet received the Duke of\r\nDevonshire's memorandum respecting Sir W. Rumbold, and that in the meantime\r\nI was getting into as small a compass as possible the information he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nI added that the liberation of the Nizam changed our position with respect\r\nto Sir W. Rumbold, and I should be glad to speak to him about it.\r\n\r\nI reminded him of Lord Clare's appointment, not yet approved by the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 8._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. The Committee on the Bank Charter to be taken out of\r\nHuskisson's hands.\r\n\r\nThe King was not well yesterday. The Duke recollected Clare's appointment,\r\nand thinks I shall have the warrant in a day or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 9._\r\n\r\nWrote to Wrangham, begging him to send me the Cabinet box I desired the\r\nCabinet messenger to take to my house yesterday. I think it contained the\r\npapers relative to Russian projects against India.\r\n\r\nI have been so unwell the last two days I have been unable to do any public\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 12._\r\n\r\nHad some conversation with Hardinge. He thinks the Duke will not remain in\r\noffice above a year more, and that Peel will then be Minister, and that\r\nPeel looks forward to that now. I said I feared he would be a very Radical\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nHardinge thinks Sir G. Murray would be very well satisfied to be Master-\r\nGeneral, that he feels the Colonial Office is above him. I doubt, however,\r\nif he would like leaving it. If Peel was Minister he would have all the\r\nMinisters he could in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFrom what Hardinge heard from Croker I am inclined to think that foolish\r\nfellow and others imagine they could go on without Peel.\r\n\r\nI do not think it impossible we may have a dissolution of Parliament if\r\nthere should be a good harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 12._\r\n\r\nSent the letter and list of Russian papers about China to the Duke. Wrote\r\nto Aberdeen and told him so. Observed at the same time that I should be\r\nvery glad to make some arrangement with the Portuguese for excluding opium\r\nfrom their Indian ports; but I feared the present state of our relations\r\nwith Portugal was not favourable for our doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 13._\r\n\r\nFound in London the papers I had sent to the Duke. He says he is sorry he\r\nhas read them. He had thought better of Sir Ch. Metcalfe. The only one of\r\nthe four who writes _common sense_ is Elphinstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 15._\r\n\r\nThe King was apparently very ill indeed yesterday.\r\n\r\nReceived a medal struck for the native troops engaged in the Burmese war\r\nfrom Loch, and another to be transmitted to the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 16._\r\n\r\nSaw Hardinge, who called upon me at R.\r\n\r\nThe King has really been very ill, but certainly not worse than the\r\nbulletin made him.\r\n\r\nSir H. Halford does not go down to-day, nor will there be any more\r\nbulletins.\r\n\r\nHardinge seems to be dissatisfied with Peel, who he says is cold and never\r\nencourages any one. All this is very true.\r\n\r\nI think Hardinge rather looks to the Colonial Office. He thinks Sir G.\r\nMurray does not do the business well, and that he would be perfectly\r\nsatisfied with the Ordnance. Hardinge does not like Ireland, yet, I think,\r\nhe will find he goes to Ireland. The Duke certainly wishes it.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Clarence is very fond of Hardinge, and tells him all he means\r\nto do when he is 'King William.' This seems much confined at present to\r\nchanges in uniforms. He means to make the Blues _red_, and to have gold\r\nlace for all the Line, and silver lace for all the Militia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 17._\r\n\r\nSaw Sir A. Campbell at 1. He came about his claim upon the Company. I told\r\nhim I transacted all business of that nature in writing. I gave him\r\ninformation as to the proposal of the Chairs, which is to give him staff\r\nallowances for a year, instead of Batta, by which he would gain about\r\n15,850 R., or about 1,580£. What he wants is about 25,000£, or the\r\ndifference between that and the value of his pension of 1,000£ a year--that\r\nis, 15,000£.\r\n\r\nWent to the Foreign Office. No news there or at the Treasury of the King.\r\nThe report is that he is better.\r\n\r\nRead there for an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nPolignac offers, if it were desired, to sign a Convention upon the\r\nprinciples laid down in Aberdeen's despatch as to Algiers.\r\n\r\nHe seems out of humour altogether with Leopold; Villele seems to have no\r\ngreat disposition to come in, although his friends have. He says the\r\nOpposition will in any case have 180 votes in the new Chamber.\r\n\r\nSpain will withdraw her Minister and have only a Chargé d'Affaires at\r\nLisbon if Don Miguel will not grant the amnesty.\r\n\r\nFrance does not remonstrate against the abolition of the Salic Law in\r\nSpain, as she precluded herself by treaty from the succession. The law was\r\notherwise in the old Spanish monarchy. [Footnote: The Salic law was\r\nintroduced by Philip V. of Spain, the first Bourbon king, whose own claim\r\nwas through his mother, daughter of Louis XIV., who had renounced the\r\nsuccession.] The abrogation of the Salic law is directed against Don\r\nCarlos, &c., and the King naturally wishes his own child to succeed, be the\r\nchild male or female.\r\n\r\nSaw Mr. Downie on the part of Mr. Chippendale, the man who was removed by\r\nthe Sign Manual from the service of the India Company. The Court and the\r\nBengal Government did not view his offence in the same light. The poor man\r\nis ruined, but the feelings of humanity must not interfere with the\r\ninterests of the public service. His removal was a good hint to the whole\r\nbody of civil servants, and did good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 18._\r\n\r\nBrought Lord Clare home after church, and showed him my letter to Mr.\r\nElphinstone respecting the chiefs of Kattywar and the Guicowar. Talked over\r\nthe policy to be pursued with regard to them.\r\n\r\nHe is to leave England in September, and means to go to Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 19._\r\n\r\nLord William seems to have been much gratified by my letters in May and\r\nJune affording the pledges of my support and the assurances of my\r\nconfidence. Afterwards, however, he received my letter of July, intimating\r\ncensure for the relaxations of the rules restricting the residence of\r\nEuropeans, and a difference of opinion as to the Government leaving\r\nCalcutta. His letters are in a very good tone and temper.\r\n\r\nI sent all the letters to the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 20._\r\n\r\nDrove to the Foreign Office and saw Aberdeen. Went to enquire how the King\r\nreally was, for the bulletin of yesterday says his difficulty of breathing\r\ncontinues. Aberdeen said the King really was not so ill as the bulletin\r\nrepresented him to be. There was no present danger. The Duke thinks he\r\nunderstands the King's case exactly, and says he has no water on the chest,\r\nas is reported, but is _rather fat_. It is said the seat of pain is the\r\nprostate gland. The people about him are seriously alarmed.\r\n\r\nAdvised Hardinge, who dined with me, to come forward on the Terceira\r\nquestion, which he seems inclined to do. Peel will be much obliged to him.\r\nI told him I thought the strong position was this: 'We are at liberty to\r\nprevent that which, if we permitted, would be a cause of war.' I think I\r\nshall write a memorandum for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 21._\r\n\r\nWrote to Astell to ask if he would buy the Russian China papers. I told him\r\nat the same time that a Russian ship was going at the charge of the Russian\r\nGovernment to India, Swan River, and China as a commercial feeler.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. The King is rather better, but in a precarious state. The\r\nembarrassment in his breathing comes on in spasms. His digestion is good,\r\nand they think there is no water. The Duke will urge him to have regular\r\nbulletins published. He goes down tomorrow. He has not seen him since this\r\nday week. The King is in excellent humour with everybody, and never was\r\nmore kind to the Duke.\r\n\r\nThere has been a short difference between the King and Peel. The King\r\nhaving sent a pardon to Ireland for a Mr. Comyn, who burnt his house to\r\ndefraud his landlord, &c., Peel insisted, and the man will be hanged; the\r\nLord Lieutenant having taken upon himself to give a reprieve only, and not\r\nto promulgate the pardon.\r\n\r\nThe Duke described the King as a bold man, afraid of nothing if his\r\nMinisters would stand by him, and certainly neither afraid of pain or of\r\ndeath. I did not think this of the King. In general he has been supposed to\r\nbe a coward.\r\n\r\nIn Cabinet it was decided to authorise and advise the Lord Lieutenant to\r\nput into execution the law for suppressing the association against that\r\nwhich O'Connell is now endeavouring to organise, and at the same time to\r\ngive silk gowns to Shiel and two or three other Roman Catholic barristers,\r\nomitting O'Connell. However, this last measure will be mentioned to the\r\nKing, although a King's letter is not required.\r\n\r\nWe had afterwards a talk, and a long one, about Algiers.\r\n\r\nPrince Polignac sent a despatch to the Duc de Laval, giving explanations\r\nsatisfactory upon the whole, but mixed up with matter accusatory of us. Of\r\nthis despatch the Duc de Laval was not authorised to give a copy. We want a\r\nwritten declaration of their views, none other being official. They are\r\nafraid of their Chambers, and of giving a pledge to England different from\r\nthat which they have given to other Powers, and with which other Powers\r\nhave been satisfied. Peel thinks they will promise to abstain from\r\npermanent occupation, and exact an amount of indemnity so large, with\r\noccupation as a security, as to make that occupation permanent. If they got\r\npossession of Algiers, I do not believe they will ever give it up--say\r\nwhat they may.\r\n\r\nPeel objected to me saying what declaration would satisfy us, as in the\r\nevent of their deceiving us, or quibbling, it would then seem to be our\r\nfolly which had led to it.\r\n\r\nAll seem to view the comparative statement of the prices of teas in the\r\nsame light that I do, as fatal to the monopoly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 23._\r\n\r\nRode to the Treasury to enquire after the King; but there were so many\r\nwaiting to see the Duke I did not wait. The King is rather better.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 24._\r\n\r\nA letter from Lady Macdonald enclosing one from the Nain Muhan to herself,\r\nvery complimentary and really pretty. She is to be at Tabriz in October.\r\n\r\nThe King has had two good nights.\r\n\r\nPeel's letters to the Lord Lieutenant respecting the suppression of the new\r\nAssociation and the appointment of Catholic King's Counsel was circulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, April 25._\r\n\r\nRead Aberdeen's and the Duke's speeches on the Terceira question, and\r\nafterwards wrote a memorandum for Hardinge's use, bringing into a short\r\ncompass all the strong points of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Sullivan called upon me after church, and told me his son remained in\r\nIndia. It is very extraordinary that he should be glad of this, as he must\r\nbe without the hope of ever seeing him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 26._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. The King has had another good night. He has, however, had\r\nanother attack. His pulse is in a weak state. He seems oppressed by fat. He\r\nis become alarmed about himself, which much increases danger in such a\r\ncomplaint. Consequently all the _entourage_ is alarmed too.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room and levee are to be postponed _sine die_. Trade and\r\nagriculture are both flourishing. The only embarrassment arises out of the\r\nuncertainty as to the King's health.\r\n\r\nLeopold is to have a loan of sixty millions, guaranteed in equal portions\r\nby the three Powers. The loan to have a sinking fund of 3 per cent, to be\r\npaid in equal portions in eight years. The guarantee is to Leopold and his\r\ndescendants, being sovereigns of Greece.\r\n\r\nThus he has obtained almost all he asked, and what he most wanted, the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nPeel seems to think the King's death by no means improbable. If it should\r\ntake place, Parliament would adjourn till after the funeral, and then be\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nIn the House Lord Durham, in presenting a petition against the East Indian\r\nmonopoly, said he gathered from what had fallen from His Majesty's\r\nMinisters that they were determined to maintain it.\r\n\r\nI said, 'I cannot admit that anything which has fallen from me, or, in my\r\npresence, from any of my noble colleagues, can justify the noble lord in\r\nassuming that His Majesty's Government have formed any determined opinion\r\nupon the subject.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 27._\r\n\r\nHouse. East Retford case. The Duke showed me a letter from Halford which\r\ngives a very alarming account of the King. He went on much the same till\r\nhalf-past three this morning, when Halford was sent for and remained till\r\nhalf-past eight. The embarrassment of breathing was considerable. The King\r\nwas rather better at half-past ten, when the bulletin was dated. Halford\r\nsays he can tell more than he can write. He does write that there is\r\n_water_, and it is evident the King is very much alarmed.\r\n\r\nFrom the letter I should say he could not live many weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the House Lord Strangford told me that Sir W. Seymour [Footnote:\r\nRecently appointed a judge at Bombay.] was dead. He died in December--a\r\nshort time after the birth of his son.\r\n\r\nReally the mortality amongst judges is awful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 28._\r\n\r\nWent to Guildhall to be present at the trial of Serjeant Kearney for the\r\nassault on Astell. I was not called as a witness. The man was very\r\nintemperate indeed, and abused Astell very much. He spoke of my kind\r\ninterference, &c., but made a mistake in imagining that I had advocated\r\nwith the Chairs the loan he asked of 250£. I came away as soon as the\r\nRecorder began to sum up. It was curious to see how justice was\r\nadministered. The Recorder, an old twaddle, who talked half the time with\r\nthe accused, and allowed him to make speeches instead of putting questions,\r\nand Sir C. Hunter, Sir J. Shaw, and another alderman!\r\n\r\nWent to the office at 3. Loch, with whom I had some conversation at\r\nGuildhall, told me he had heard the explanation Melville intended to give\r\nof the matter of prime cost, and he thought it satisfactory. Wortley said\r\nArbuthnot by no means thought it satisfactory, but was to put the\r\nquestions. Wortley said Arbuthnot told him the Duke had read the evidence\r\nand was himself satisfied the monopoly could not be maintained.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Lord Bathurst's. The Duke was at Windsor this morning. He\r\ndid not see the King because the King refused to see the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and begged the Duke would not see him unless it was very\r\npressing, that the rebuff to the Duke of Cumberland might be less.\r\nAccordingly, the Duke sent in on paper what he had to say, and he got two\r\nsignatures, although they were given very reluctantly. The King says it is\r\n_unkind_ in those about him to urge him to sign, as they know how\r\ndistressing it is to him. In fact _yesterday_ it would have been death to\r\nmove his arm. We are to meet on Friday to consider what shall be done. Some\r\nmeans must be devised of getting signatures, for his state may last some\r\nmonths. He was ill for four hours yesterday evening. Halford was with him\r\nall the time, and held his hand. Halford says he is sure the King would\r\nhave died had he not been there. He was nearly dead as it was. However,\r\nafter this attack, which began at half-past two, he had a solid dinner and\r\nslept well, and this morning he woke much relieved, but _with a dropsy_--\r\nthat is, an external dropsy, the water being between the skin. Knighton\r\nthinks some must be upon the chest; but the two others are inclined to\r\nthink not. He may live days, weeks, or even months; but I doubt his living\r\nweeks. On Sunday he saw the women, and on Monday too. He was then alarmed\r\nabout himself. Now he mistakes water for gout, although his legs are\r\nswelled to double their usual size. The physicians do not undeceive him.\r\nHowever, the public will find it out. He has not read the newspapers for\r\ntwo days _He_ is much relieved by the effusion of water.\r\n\r\nIt seems the medical men when they read the first bulletin said, 'It must\r\nend in water.'\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn has looked into the Acts, &c., and finds there is no\r\ndifficulty at all about the money vote on the Bills. They all went on at\r\nthe accession of the present King.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was requested by the physicians and the people about the King not\r\nto mention Shiel's proposed appointment; to make it, if he thought it\r\nessential, but to spare the King all discussion. Of course, as it is\r\nthought the King would be agitated, the Duke has neither mentioned it nor\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\nThere was in circulation a letter from the Duke of Northumberland\r\nexpressing his extreme satisfaction at the decision of the Government with\r\nrespect to the putting down of the new associations, and likewise with\r\nrespect to the making of the Catholic silk gowns.\r\n\r\nThe bulletins are to be now shown at St. James's; a lord and groom-in-\r\nwaiting will be there.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Sir J. Dewar [Footnote: Chief Justice of Bombay and\r\na colleague of Sir W. Seymour. They were the two judges referred to in the\r\nletter to Sir J. Malcolm.] to inform me of the death of Sir W. Seymour. He\r\ndied more of the fear of dying than of fever. His apprehension for Lady\r\nSeymour affected him very much. She was confined the day he was taken ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 29._\r\n\r\nHalford thinks worse of the King. There have been other attacks of\r\nembarrassment of breathing. I do not myself think he will live a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThere was an excellent division on Terceira about 2-1/2 to 1. Hardinge was\r\nnot wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 30._\r\n\r\nCabinet. The King very ill yesterday. The least exertion brings on an\r\nattack. Halford thinks he has water in the abdomen and chest. He had some\r\nsleep, and was better in the morning when they issued the bulletin, which\r\nsays his symptoms were alleviated. However, the bulletin so little\r\ncorresponds with his real state that they think he saw it. It seems to be\r\nnow more an affair of days than of weeks. It may happen at any moment.\r\n\r\nPeel suggested the possible case of both Kings dying before an Act\r\nappointing a regent, and we may be called upon to provide for it. The\r\nDuchess of Clarence would be Queen Regent.\r\n\r\nWe talked about a Bill for enabling the King to give authority for the\r\naffixing of the Sign Manual.\r\n\r\nTo avoid delay and the examination of physicians Rosslyn proposed that, if\r\nthe King would sign it, there should be a message.\r\n\r\nIt will be arranged that there shall be two Ministers present-one to\r\ncountersign, the other to affix the stamp.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney- and Solicitor-General were called in. They evidently thought\r\nthe King's mind was gone as well as his head, for they proposed a\r\ndelegation of the Royal authority.\r\n\r\nPlanta called upon me to ask more particulars as to the office of Signer of\r\nthe Writs. It seems it comes in lucky time to oblige Lord Chandos, who has\r\nlong wanted something for a Mr. Wentworth, and nothing could have happened\r\nmore conveniently for the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 1._\r\n\r\nMet Lord Rosslyn, who told me he and Lord Bathurst met every committee day\r\nLord Londonderry and Lord Durham on the Coal Committee. Sometimes they\r\ncould not get a fifth, and then they adjourned joyfully. Both Lord\r\nLondonderry and Lord Durham continued most wrong-headed upon the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 2._\r\n\r\nI rode as fast as I could to town as soon as church was over (for the Duke\r\nhad wished to see me before he went to church, thinking I was in town), and\r\nin Brompton met Lord Rosslyn, who told me there was no Cabinet, and that\r\nthe Duke had found the King better than he expected.\r\n\r\nRode at once to Apsley House. The Duke was gone out, having left word he\r\nshould be back soon if I came. I waited an hour. When he returned he told\r\nme he had no idea I was out of town, or he would not have written. Lord\r\nCombermere had asked to see him, which he could not refuse.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said that on Friday the King was much better. The miracle which\r\nthe physicians had said could alone save him seemed accomplished. Great\r\nquantities of ether-quantities much greater than are usually given-had\r\napparently restored him, and all were in good spirits, when, feeling\r\nhimself much better, he drank a great deal and was actually sick! Thence\r\nthe indifferent night of Friday. On Saturday he was better again, and when\r\nthe Duke saw him, seemingly very well, quite alive--in very good humour\r\nwith everybody, and quite without nervousness. However, he passed a bad\r\nnight, as the bulletin says, probably in consequence of having drunk again.\r\nSir H. Halford was quite in tears on Saturday, not more on account of the\r\nKing's state than on account of his own professional disappointment. He had\r\nthought on the Friday that he had accomplished a miracle. They have treated\r\nthe King as if he had been a hospital patient, and have _épuisé'd_ the\r\nresources of art boldly applied to his case.\r\n\r\nThe King did not express the least apprehension to the Duke; but to the\r\nwomen he speaks of his danger, and as if he was a dying man. The Duke\r\nthinks he does this to try and vex Lady Conyngham.\r\n\r\nThe thing most surprising to me is the Duke's opinion of the King's firm\r\ncourage. He said he had seen him not only now, but before, when he was\r\nconsidered not to have twenty-four hours of life in him, yet he, knowing\r\nhis situation, was perfectly firm.\r\n\r\nBefore the Duke came I had some talk with Holmes, whom I met with Drummond.\r\nHolmes said they could finish the session by the end of July if they acted\r\nwith that view. I fear it will last much longer if the King lives, and if\r\nhe dies, that we shall have a six weeks' session in August and September.\r\nHolmes said he did not think the King's illness by any means diminished the\r\nstrength of Government. He thought the friends of Government were rather\r\nmore disposed to come down, and he could on any great question get 300.\r\n\r\nHe had gone round on Wednesday to the reporters, and had told them they\r\nwould never have a holiday if they reported speeches on a Wednesday, so\r\nthey did not, and they will not. This will put an end to all speechifying\r\non holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 3._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Saw a letter from Halford to the Duke. The King was 'in a most\r\ndistressing, not to say alarming, state' from eight to-day evening to half-\r\npast three. He cannot get sleep. Halford says it was 'a gigantic struggle.'\r\n\r\nThe Duke saw Lord Combermere to-day, having received the letters I sent him\r\nbefore the interview. The Duke told him the Government were parties to the\r\ndisapprobation expressed by the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nLord C. threw the whole blame upon Lord W. Bentinck. He had carried the\r\norder into execution without communication with him, 'and had told the army\r\nif they objected to it, they might memorialise.'\r\n\r\nThis _I do not believe_.\r\n\r\nLord C. said the army was not in a state approaching to mutiny, and never\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nHe had not said it was in his minutes (but he did in a letter); as to the\r\nminutes of the other members of Council, he was not responsible for them.\r\nThey were civilians. Besides, Lord W. wished to go up the country. He had\r\nreceived in July a letter telling him he was not to go except in a case of\r\nemergency, then the Government was not to move from Calcutta, and he\r\nendeavoured in his minute and the others in theirs to make an apparent case\r\nof emergency that they might move.\r\n\r\nAs to the last point there is an anachronism, as the orders not to leave\r\nCalcutta _as a Government_ arrived after the minutes were recorded.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told Lord Combermere that all the orders for reduction of\r\nexpenditure having proved inefficacious, it was necessary for the\r\nGovernment here to take reduction into their hands, and it was very natural\r\nand obvious to enforce an order twice repeated and already obeyed at the\r\nother presidencies.\r\n\r\nWhen the army assumed the tone which appeared in the memorials, it was\r\nimpossible for the Government to do otherwise than insist upon the\r\nenforcement of the order. They had expected from him that his whole\r\ninfluence would have been used to strengthen the Government and to prevent\r\nany ebullition of feeling on the part of the army. Lord Combermere left the\r\nDuke very angry. If the King had been well he would have joined Lord\r\nAnglesey. As it is, I expect he will oppose the Government. Lord Hill saw\r\nhim for a few minutes, and had only some unimportant conversation with him.\r\nHe told Lord Hill he had made thirteen or fourteen lacs. He made seven lacs\r\nby prize money at Bhurtpore.\r\n\r\nThe French have not yet given a written explanation as to Algiers. Their\r\narmy is said to be in very fine order.\r\n\r\nLeopold seems to have insinuated that our yielding on the subject of the\r\nloan was sudden and late, &c. Aberdeen understood him to allude to the\r\nKing's illness, and to impute our concession to the wish to get him out of\r\nthe way. He took no notice of it, and treated the thing as settled.\r\n\r\nPreparations have been made for the event of the King's death.\r\n\r\nPeel has been obliged to leave London, as his father is dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 4._\r\n\r\nCommittee. No witnesses. Walked with Lords Bathurst and Rosslyn to the\r\nDuke's. The bulletin is good. The King had some sleep and is better.\r\nHalford's account, too, is better. The King slept six hours, but the water\r\nwas so much increased about the legs that they have made punctures to draw\r\nit off. Upon the whole the account leads one to suppose the thing will be\r\nprotracted.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons last night, Goulburn was obliged to withdraw the\r\nvote of 100,000£. for Windsor Castle and refer it to a Committee upstairs.\r\nThe expectation of a dissolution is acting powerfully on votes, and he\r\nwould have been beaten. The Duke approved entirely of his having withdrawn\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the King in this state would be highly inconvenient\r\nindeed. There would be no possibility of carrying on the money business in\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords we had a motion from Lord MountCashel for an address\r\nfor a commission to enquire into the abuses of the English and Irish\r\nChurch. No one thought it worth while to reply to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 5._\r\n\r\nRead and altered a letter relative to the new arrangement of civil\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\nElphinstone approved generally of what I proposed--which is.\r\n\r\n1. To depose every chief who shall harbour banditti.\r\n\r\n2. To oblige them to give up refugee criminals under the same penalty.\r\n\r\n3. To engage as many as possible to abandon their heritable jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n4. To remit the arrears.\r\n\r\n5. To form a local corps in which the chiefs and their relations should be\r\nofficers (with only two or three Europeans) to maintain order. This corps\r\nto be a sort of bodyguard to the Resident. The robbers to be admitted as\r\nprivates.\r\n\r\n6. Troops to be brought if necessary from Cutch.\r\n\r\n7. Every measure to be adopted to encourage the growth of cotton.\r\n\r\nThese things I shall throw into a letter, which, however, will not be sent\r\ntill Clare goes out.\r\n\r\nWe talked of native education. I read to E. my alterations of the letter of\r\nlast July relative to his plans for education, with which he seemed\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHe seems generally to approve of my views upon that subject, particularly\r\nof uniting the English with the native classes at the several colleges, and\r\nteaching the natives useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nThey should be examined in the regulations of the company.\r\n\r\nOffice, but first saw Hardinge, who seems full of the Duke of Clarence,\r\nwith whom he is high in favour, as having, urged by Wood, had several\r\nthings done for the young FitzClarences.\r\n\r\nHe said the Duke thought the King might live four months.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at the Chancellor's. The Duke saw the King, who looked very\r\nwell, and seemed cheerful and in good humour.\r\n\r\nHe was very ill yesterday. Black in the face, and the ends of his fingers\r\nblack. They think he will go off suddenly in one of these attacks.\r\n\r\nLittle water came from one leg, and they will scarify it again.\r\n\r\nO'Reilly, who probably performed the operation of scarifying, and who must\r\nknow the state of the King, whom he saw daily, declared positively\r\nyesterday to Lord Maryborough, and with a face of surprise, that there was\r\nno water.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of C. saw the King on Sunday, and was at Windsor and probably saw\r\nhim to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Sussex has lent the King an easy chair, and affectionate\r\nmessages have passed between them.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Chichester is now at Windsor, the Lord and Groom and Equerry\r\nin waiting, two physicians, besides O'Reilly and Sir Wathen Waller and\r\nKnighton.\r\n\r\nWhen they told the King they must make a puncture in about four hours, he\r\ndesired it might be made at once if it was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told the King he had told Sir H. Halford he would always find him\r\nintrepid--with which the King was much pleased.\r\n\r\nHe said when he saw a thing was necessary he always made up his mind to it.\r\n\r\nWortley told me the Household betted the King would be at Ascot.\r\n\r\nBy-the-bye, Wortley did very well last night in not allowing Wynne to lead\r\nhim into a speech on the half-castes. He spoke very officially and\r\nproperly. I complimented him upon it. In fact it is an act of forbearance\r\nin any man, but especially in a young man, to throw away a speech.\r\n\r\nPrecedents have been looked into, and every necessary step is known, should\r\nthe King die.\r\n\r\nThe Duke will immediately go in uniform to the Duke of Clarence and advise\r\nhim to come to his house in town.\r\n\r\nA sketch of the speech will be prepared, but kings like making the\r\ndeclaration to the Privy Council themselves, as it is the only thing they\r\ncan do without advice.\r\n\r\nPeel's father died on the 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 6._\r\n\r\nLeft my card with Lord Combermere, who called yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe bulletin states the King to have been better yesterday, but to have had\r\na bad night.\r\n\r\nThe private letter to the Duke says he passed the night wretchedly, and\r\nwith much inquietude. They find it necessary to make further punctures, and\r\nhave sent for Brodie.\r\n\r\nThe King spoke to Halford for some time with much composure and piety as to\r\nhis situation.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst looked into the precedents in Queen Anne's reign, and at the\r\ndeclarations of several kings on their first meeting their Privy Council.\r\n\r\nHouse. A good and useful speech from Lord Goderich on the funded and\r\nexpended debt. He showed that the receipt from taxes was about the same as\r\nin 1816, although 9 millions had been taken off, and that the interest of\r\nthe National Debt would, in 1831, be reduced 44 millions below its amount\r\nin 1816.\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past ten at Aberdeen's. A letter from Leopold, endeavouring\r\nto throw upon us the blame of delay for two months, and treating\r\nacquiescence in his terms of loan as a _sine quâ non_. Now the terms we\r\npropose are not _exactly_ the same, as we make a payment by annual\r\ninstalments a part of it, and I expect he will break off at last; but he\r\nwill wait till the King is actually dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 7._\r\n\r\nA very good account of the King. He has passed twenty-four hours with\r\nmitigated symptoms.\r\n\r\nDined with Sir J. Murray. I must next year have an Indian dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 9._\r\n\r\nRead as I went to town to Cabinet, and returned in the carriage Cabell's\r\nmemorandum on the Hyderabad transactions.\r\n\r\nThe Duke read the letter he had received from Sir H. Halford. It gave a bad\r\naccount of the King. Yesterday was a day 'of embarrassment and distress,'\r\nand he is swollen notwithstanding the punctures made by Brodie. He is\r\nanxious about himself, and must know his danger, yet he talks of the\r\nnecessity of having a new dining-room at the Cottage ready by Ascot.\r\n\r\nWe had much conversation respecting the law asserting his power of\r\ndisposing of his property by will.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor was not there. He went to Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe other matters considered were merely the mode of dealing with several\r\nquestions to be brought on next week. It seems to be clear that no\r\ndependence whatever can be placed in the House of Commons. Every man will\r\nvote for his constituents.\r\n\r\nNo answer has been received from Prince Leopold.\r\n\r\nMy apprehension is that the King cannot live ten days.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry went to Windsor yesterday and saw the physician. He had a\r\ndinner afterwards at his villa, and told every one, the Lièvens being\r\nthere, that the King was much worse than he had ever been. This was untrue,\r\nfor the Duke left Windsor after Lord L., and when he left the Castle the\r\nKing certainly was not worse, but rather better. I have no doubt Lord L.\r\nmanaged to tell Wood, [Footnote: Lord Londonderry's brother-in-law, having\r\nmarried Lady Caroline Stewart, also sister-in-law of Lord Ellenborough.]\r\nand Wood would tell the Duke of Clarence, who would think he was ill-used\r\nand deceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 10._\r\n\r\nThe Duke will read the Hyderabad memorandum as he goes down to Windsor on\r\nWednesday.\r\n\r\nI told him of the alteration in the treaty with Nagpore.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor was at Windsor yesterday. He did not see the King. The\r\nphysicians seemed to think it could not last a week. He is greatly swollen,\r\nand generally.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst went to Windsor to-day. His account was a little better, but\r\nhis expectation did not go beyond a fortnight. In the meantime the\r\nphysicians are afraid of telling the King of his danger.\r\n\r\nSir W. Knighton sat up with him last night, and was much alarmed by one of\r\nthe attacks, not having seen one before. However, he did not call Sir H.\r\nHalford.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that the new Parliament will meet in the last week in\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker says the House of Commons is like a school two days before the\r\nholidays. They do not know what mischief to be at.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn seems to think all sorts of intrigues are going on, and has\r\nsome little doubt as to the Duke of Clarence. I have none.\r\n\r\nHouse. E. Retford again. Wrote to Lord Holland when I came home to call his\r\nattention to the Hickson Nullity of Marriage Bill. I cannot take a part;\r\nbut he must do so if he wishes to preserve his grandfather's clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 11._\r\n\r\nHeard from Lord Holland, who is fully alive to the consequences of the\r\nBill. He thinks I am right not to take a part.\r\n\r\nThere was an indigo-planter before the Committee to-day. It seems, as I\r\nsupposed, to be just as unnecessary for indigo-manufacturers to be indigo-\r\ngrowers as it is for maltsters to be great farmers. This man took out no\r\ncapital and he had no licence; yet he was permitted to reside and take a\r\nlease, and the agency houses lent him money at 10 and 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe judge, Sir T. Strange, was a sensible man. He deprecated the\r\nintroduction of English law into the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe King is getting weaker, which the physicians dread more than his\r\nspasms. It is thought he can hardly last a week.\r\n\r\nRead the memorandum on Hyderabad a second time, and sent it with the\r\nproposed letter and alterations to the Duke.\r\n\r\nPrepared materials for Lord Stanhope's motion about shipping on Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 12._\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Lord Rosslyn's.\r\n\r\nThe Duke saw the King to-day. He said there was a decided alteration since\r\nWednesday last. He was now in appearance an invalid, but not a dying man.\r\nHis body is very much swollen. They took several quarts of water from his\r\nfeet yesterday. He is good-humoured and alive. His eyes as brilliant as\r\never. His voice a little affected. His colour dark and sodden.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks he may die at any time; but may live a fortnight or ten\r\ndays--Knighton thinks so too. The other physicians think worse of him.\r\n\r\nHe called for the 'Racing Calendar' yesterday. They were afraid he would\r\ncall for the newspaper.\r\n\r\nKnighton found he was not aware there were now any bulletins.\r\n\r\nKnighton proposed to him the taking the sacrament, as he did not take it at\r\nEaster. He said he would think about it, but to be better before he took\r\nit. His taking it now might lead to the publishing of more bulletins.\r\n\r\nHe continues to take the greatest interest in the improvements at the\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we talked only of the things necessary to be done on a demise.\r\n\r\nLord B. seemed to say we _could not_ have the Duchess of Clarence as\r\nRegent, because there was no precedent. I trust this will be got over.\r\n\r\nLeopold has written an unsatisfactory answer to the last letter about the\r\nloan. However, he goes.\r\n\r\nThe Porte has acquiesced in the arrangements of the protocol, so Leopold is\r\nPrince Sovereign of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe Duke read Cabell's memorandum to-day. He thinks Cabell proposes doing\r\nmore than should be done. He has a strong feeling as to the scandalous\r\nnature of the whole transaction. Lieutenant-Colonel Arabin has been\r\ninfesting the Chancellor upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 13._\r\n\r\nDined at four. Rode to the office and back, and to the House.\r\n\r\nPrepared for Lord Stanhope's motion for returns on shipping, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had a great deal of information, and answered Lord Stanhope. I\r\nspoke, however, afterwards, as I had some new facts. Then E. Retford till\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nRead letters from Sir John Macdonald and a paper he enclosed from\r\n'Blackwood's Magazine' in 1827 on the invasion of India by the Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 14._\r\n\r\nColonel Briggs called. He is a clever man. He will prepare for me a\r\nmemorandum on the composition of the native army. He seems equally\r\nconversant with revenue, judicial, and military matters.\r\n\r\nHouse. E. Retford as usual. The King is much relieved by the draining of\r\nthe water from the punctures; but the wounds gave him much annoyance last\r\nnight. The fear is they may lead to mortification. Lord Rosslyn and I go\r\ndown on Sunday to Windsor to enquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 15._\r\n\r\nAstell has sent to Lord Combermere the letter lately despatched to India in\r\nwhich the conduct of the several members of Government is commented upon as\r\nregards the Batta question. Lord Combermere only asked, as far as I\r\nrecollect, to know upon what grounds his conduct has been censured. I told\r\nAstell to tell him the censure rested entirely on official documents with\r\nwhich he must be acquainted. The Duke was very angry with Astell, when I\r\ntold him of it after the Cabinet, and expects a question in the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\nI told Astell the letter ought not to have been given. It reveals what has\r\nbeen done with regard to the Batta question, and the news may possibly\r\nreach India through the press before the Government obtain it.\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past four. Not only have the Turks acceded to the\r\narrangement for Greece, but the Greeks have done so too. Leopold adheres to\r\nhis memorandum of March, and wants the power of drawing as much as he\r\npleases of the loan at any time.\r\n\r\nHe will be invited to meet the Plenipotentiaries or to send a person to\r\nmeet them to discuss this point. The people about him say he means to break\r\noff. If he should, Peel thinks we could not do it upon a better point, and\r\nhe is right.\r\n\r\nThe King is decidedly better. The Duke saw him to day. He was looking more\r\nhealthy. He has had some refreshing sleep. He is more likely to live than\r\nto die. The only danger is from mortification in consequence of the\r\npunctures; but his constitution is so good that in all probability he will\r\navoid this danger. This wonderful recovery quite changes our position. In\r\nall public business we must now calculate upon his living--at least till\r\nthe end of the Session.\r\n\r\nLord Morpeth is to make a motion for the repeal of the Banishment Clause in\r\nthe last Libel Act. To the repeal of that clause, which is inoperative\r\nagainst the common libeller, we have no objection, and the Attorney-General\r\nis pledged to it; but the House of Lords would not like, and the King would\r\nnot endure, the repeal of that provision without the substitution of some\r\nother security. That proposed by the Attorney-General is the requiring\r\nsecurity to the amount of 500L. from two sureties that the editor shall pay\r\n_fines_ on account of libels. This is reasonable, and would to some extent\r\nprevent the putting up, as is now done, men or women of straw as editors,\r\nwho have no means of paying fines. The other proposal of the Attorney-\r\nGeneral, that the types should be seizable to whomever they may belong, is\r\nobjectionable and would hardly be carried. Peel is very sorry the question\r\nis stirred at the present moment. The press is generally with us or\r\nquiescent, and the 'Morning Journal,' [Footnote: It had been obliged to pay\r\nheavy damages for a libel on the Duke of Wellington.] a paper instituted to\r\noppose the Government, has within these few days been given up altogether\r\nfrom the want of support. Certainly this is not the moment at which it is\r\ndesirable to appear to commence an attack upon the Press--and the Attorney-\r\nGeneral can do nothing that will not be suspected by them.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has written a memorandum on the Hyderabad affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 16._\r\n\r\nRead the Duke's memorandum; he mistakes the law. However, I cannot write\r\nnotes upon his memorandum without the Act of Parliament. The King had an\r\nindifferent night, but still feels better. I only met Lord Bathurst, who\r\ntold me so. He had not seen the private letter.\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation with Lady C. Wood at Lord Camden's about the\r\nClarences. It seems there has been a great deal of hope excited in the\r\nSpencers.\r\n\r\nThey expect Lord Holland to be made Minister, and their son Bob or Lord\r\nDarnley to be first Lord of the Admiralty!--_Nous verrons_.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Duchess of Clarence and the Duchess of Kent were and are great\r\nfriends, and the Duchess of Clarence is very fond of the young Princess.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, May 17._\r\n\r\nAt eleven set off with Lord Rosslyn for Windsor. We drove to the visitor's\r\nentrance. After a time Sir A. Barnard came. Lord Rosslyn said we did not\r\npresume to ask to see the King, but we were anxious to know how His Majesty\r\nwas, and to present our humble duty to him.\r\n\r\nSir A. asked if we would see Knighton? Lord Rosslyn said it would be very\r\nsatisfactory. However, no Knighton came, but a message through Sir A.\r\nBarnard that Sir Wm. Knighton had gone in to the King and had mentioned we\r\nwere there, and His Majesty had expressed himself very sensible of our kind\r\nattention. This I conclude is Knighton's own message, and that the King\r\nwill never hear we have been. Sir A. Barnard seemed in excellent spirits\r\nabout the King. He had a good night, and is certainly much better. He talks\r\nof being able to go to Ascot and to stand up in the carriage, though he\r\ncould not go up into the stand.\r\n\r\nWe met the Bishop of Chichester going back to town. I suppose he thinks he\r\nshall not be wanted.\r\n\r\nRode down to the House. East Retford.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's private account of the King is excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 18._\r\n\r\nCommittee. Examined Colonel Briggs, who gave very good evidence indeed.\r\nOrdered the attendance of six witnesses for Tuesday, whom we shall\r\nendeavour to despatch, and that will enable everybody to go to Epsom on\r\nThursday and Friday.\r\n\r\nThe King much better. All his symptoms alleviated.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow the Duke will get from him his signature to the message for a\r\n_stamper_. There are to be three signatures of Ministers, that is, of Privy\r\nCouncillors, to authorise the stamper, who is to be nominated by the King\r\nto affix the royal stamp to instruments in the King's presence.\r\n\r\nBy the account from Marseilles, it appears that there are 11 sail of the\r\nline and 28 frigates in the French expedition, in all 97 sails--about 350\r\ntransports, carrying 75,000 tons. There will be 30,500 infantry, besides a\r\nvery complete equipment of artillery, &c., 75 battering guns, 4,000 horses.\r\nThe Luke of Angoulême's (the Dauphin's) visit has delayed the expedition\r\nfour days. They will probably be on the sea _to-day_.\r\n\r\nRosslyn was talking yesterday of the _danger_ from this expedition, and the\r\nannexation of Algiers to France. I do not fear it--we can, if we manage\r\nwell, make it very costly by bringing forward the people of Tunis and\r\nMorocco, not near the coast, but almost from the desert. We must take care\r\nto secure Tunis, and then the French will be no gainers by their move.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry made a very foolish speech about foreign policy in putting\r\noff his motion, which stood for the 25th. Aberdeen promised the Greek\r\npapers on _Monday next_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 19._\r\n\r\nThe Duke saw the King to-day and found him looking better than he did at\r\nthe last Council.\r\n\r\nThe drain from the legs is now very small. He was annoyed last night by\r\nthem and sent for Halford, who sent off for Brodie; but there was nothing\r\nof importance. They cannot yet say that he will not ultimately die of this\r\ncomplaint. Knighton thinks he will be an invalid all his life. Tierney says\r\nthey cannot tell for a week whether there is any mischief remaining about\r\nthe chest. The Duke wished to speak to him about the stamp; but he made an\r\nexcuse about his legs requiring some dressing, and the Duke, seeing he did\r\nnot choose to talk about business, went away.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that Leopold means to abdicate.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General has made his libel preventive measure a poor weak\r\ninoperative thing, ridiculous, and unconciliating.\r\n\r\nThe French Chambers are dissolved as a _coup de théâtre_ on the sailing of\r\nthe expedition, and they are to meet on August 3, by which time they expect\r\nto hear of its success.\r\n\r\nA union of parties is expected on the Greek affair. I am not sorry for it.\r\nThe Huskissonians and Whigs are drawing nearer together. The Tories, on the\r\nother hand, are rather approximating to us--so that by the beginning of\r\nnext Session men will be at last in their right places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 21._\r\n\r\nThe King had a bad night. The private letter gave a bad account. He has\r\nbeen _drinking again_, very irritable, _intolerably_ so. Halford says,\r\nwould neither sit in a chair nor lie in a bed, &c. Halford at last held\r\nstrong language, and I believe told him his life depended on his obeying\r\nhis physician.\r\n\r\nI am very much disappointed indeed at this. I hoped he was really getting\r\nbetter and would live.\r\n\r\nAberdeen is to allow the instalments of the loan guaranteed to Leopold to\r\nbe paid in four instead of eight years if he can keep him to his\r\nprincipality by doing so.\r\n\r\nThe French were off on the 18th. There is a partial change in their\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 23._\r\n\r\nRode to the Cabinet at three from Roehampton. The bulletin is that the King\r\nhad had embarrassments in his breathing.\r\n\r\nThe Duke waited two and a half hours before he saw him yesterday. The King\r\nsigned the two messages, and then said 'the Duke has just caught me in\r\ntime!' and in an instant there was a gurgling in his throat. He seized\r\nKnighton's arm. The Duke ran for Halford, went out into the gallery where\r\nhe did not find him, then into another room where he was. Halford\r\nimmediately took a bottle from the table and gave the King something which\r\nseemed to relieve him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks the King was in pain three or four seconds; but it was a\r\nminute and a half before he was relieved. He then did not speak; but made a\r\nmotion with his hand for the Duke to go.\r\n\r\nHe had just before been talking of going to Ascot and then to Aix-la-\r\nChapelle.\r\n\r\nThe King was perfectly satisfied with the proposed arrangement for the\r\nstamp.\r\n\r\nHe asked the news, was told Leopold was behaving very ill, and agreed.\r\n\r\nAs to Algiers he was told the note of the French Minister was\r\nunsatisfactory, and that it was under consideration whether a note should\r\nnot be presented. He thought it right.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's opinion is that if the King should be seized with one of those\r\nattacks when no one was with him, he would die.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Halford and the others is that the disorder is mortal; but\r\nhe may live six weeks or two months.\r\n\r\nThe punctures are healed. They are afraid of opening them again for fear of\r\nmortification, and can only proceed by medicines.\r\n\r\nThe King's state seems distressing. He can neither remain quiet in his\r\nchair or in his bed. He is in a state of constant restlessness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland was there to-day, but the King had desired he might\r\nnot see him.\r\n\r\nLeopold has declined. He sent a note to that effect on Friday night at\r\ntwelve o'clock--very well written, not by himself. Aberdeen thinks\r\nPalmerston wrote it. He takes popular ground, and cannot impose himself\r\nupon _a reluctant people_. The fact is Friday's bulletin wrote his letter.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks he will be shown up. The papers presented to-morrow will be\r\nno more than it was before intended to present; but Aberdeen will announce\r\nthe _evasion_ of the sovereign, and say that that circumstance will render\r\nnecessary the production of other papers which will be presented as soon as\r\nthey can be printed. The whole discussion will turn upon Leopold's conduct.\r\n\r\nAberdeen will be in the position of the manager of a country theatre who,\r\njust as the curtain is about to be drawn up, is obliged to come forward and\r\nannounce that the amateur gentleman who had solicited the part of Macbeth,\r\nwho had attended all the rehearsals, and whose only difficulty, which was\r\nabout money, seemed to be in a fair way of adjustment, had unexpectedly\r\nintimated his intention to withdraw in a printed address to the galleries.\r\n\r\nForsooth there should have been an appeal to the people of Greece on the\r\nsubject of their Government! An appeal to the people of Newgate on the\r\nsubject of the new police! [Footnote: This sentiment, however severe,\r\nrepresents the feeling about the Greeks of many Englishmen at that time,\r\nand especially of those who, as in the case of naval officers employed in\r\nGreek waters, had seen much of them during the war. Their struggle for\r\nindependence was undoubtedly disgraced, not only by cruelty, but by a\r\ntreachery and disregard of faith which, though perhaps attributable to past\r\nsubjection and oppression, was peculiarly odious to English observers. Lord\r\nEllenborough adopted this view.]\r\n\r\nBy a letter of C. Capo d'Istria's, dated 25 M., April 6, written\r\nimmediately after his receipt of one from Leopold (after his acceptance),\r\nit appears that Leopold had intimated his intention to change his religion.\r\nHe must have had about forty-eight hours to consider the point.\r\n\r\nLord Melville had heard that Leopold had consulted Lord Grey and Lord\r\nLansdowne without acquainting one that he had seen the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 24._\r\n\r\nRode to the office at four to receive the manufacturers. Mr. Crawford was\r\nthere, Finlay being ill. I told them of my plans as to the Indus. I\r\ndirected their attention to the point of bringing out in evidence the\r\neffect the stoppage in China had upon the general trade of the East. I\r\nagain desired them to show, if they could, why British manufactures did not\r\ngo to China by the country trade.\r\n\r\nMet Aberdeen. Told him I thought, on consideration, that a reply to Leopold\r\nwould lead to an answer from him, to which the Plenipotentiaries could not\r\nreply without entering into an undignified discussion with Palmerston, who\r\nwould be the real controversialist.\r\n\r\nThere should be an answer, but it should be addressed to the Residents, and\r\nwhat could not be addressed to them might be stated in Parliament, that is,\r\nall relating to letters, conversations, &c.\r\n\r\nI dare say Leopold will publish to-morrow. It is unlucky the French have\r\ntroops in the Morea. If they had not, I should be disposed to leave the\r\nGreeks to settle their affairs as they pleased, giving them no money. They\r\nwould soon become reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe bulletin had 'The King had a sleepless night.'\r\n\r\nHouse at five. The message and address. The Opposition made no objection to\r\nthe address, which was carried _nemine dissentiente_. Lord Grey seems to\r\nexpect a delegation of the royal authority. I told Lord Holland I thought\r\nhe would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nThen Aberdeen presented the Greek papers, and, having explained their\r\ncontents, stated the change of circumstances since Friday night. He\r\nrepresented Leopold as having made preliminary objections on other points,\r\nbut none on any but money since February 20, when he accepted. Within these\r\nfew days other grounds have been taken, and the abdication is on these\r\nother grounds.\r\n\r\nThere was much movement amongst the Opposition. Aberdeen was accused of\r\nunfairness. Lord Durham opened the fire, and I prevented Aberdeen from\r\nanswering him. The others--Darnley, Lord Londonderry, and Lord Winchelsea,\r\nall for Leopold. In short there is a general union of all those who prefer\r\nthe rising to the setting sun. We shall have a personal debate.\r\n\r\nWe went into E. Retford. I sat by the Chancellor, and worked the Bill for\r\nthe King's relief.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons little was said upon these points. Aberdeen did\r\nwell. He can make a biting speech as well as any one, and in a quiet way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 25._\r\n\r\nThe King passed yesterday uncomfortably. He was a little relieved by\r\nmedicines during the night. Water is forming again.\r\n\r\nHouse. The Chancellor explained very well the objects and details of the\r\nKing's Relief [Footnote: Relieving him from the necessity of constant\r\nsignatures.] Bill. The only objections made were to reading it to-morrow,\r\nand it was conceded that it should be read on Thursday--to its duration,\r\nand it was conceded that should last a month. Lord Grey, I hear, says it is\r\ntoo complicated, that it would have been better to appoint a Custos Regni.\r\nI hope he will say that on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThere is but little hope of the King's living till the Bill is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 26._\r\n\r\nHardinge, whom I met in the Park, told me Sir J. Graham informed him there\r\nwas to be an opposition _à l'outrance_. That Lord Anglesey was to be\r\nMinister Lord Grey would serve with him. Palmerston was to be made a great\r\nman of. Huskisson to have nothing but revenge. The Duke of Richmond was to\r\nbe had at all events. All this is childish.\r\n\r\nHouse. I expected nothing but the Chancellor's Bill, and went at half-past\r\nfive, expecting to find Eldon in the midst of his speech; but I found Lord\r\nDurham talking about Greece, and soon engaged in the talk myself. Lord Grey\r\nwas decidedly in opposition. I called the attention of the House to this,\r\nthat our conduct was to be judged of by the papers on the table--the\r\nresignation of Leopold was not alleged to have taken place in consequence\r\nof any act of the Government. If noble Lords chose to put on one side the\r\nconduct of the Government, and to make this a mere personal question as to\r\nthe conduct of Leopold we were prepared to enter into the discussion. In\r\nspeaking of Leopold I said he 'was connected with this country by some of\r\nits dearest recollections.'\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner. The King's digestion is affected now; but otherwise he is\r\nwell. He has had many attacks of embarrassed breathing; but none serious.\r\nThe Duke of Clarence was in the room with him (the Duke of W. being\r\npresent) for a quarter of an hour today. The King talked of his own danger.\r\nHe said, 'God's will be done. I have injured no man.' This he often\r\nrepeated. He said, speaking of his own danger to the Duke of Clarence, 'it\r\nwill all rest on you then.' He was in very good humour, very angry,\r\nhowever, with Leopold--his anger brought on a slight spasm.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards talked of going to Ascot, and told the Duke to manage that he\r\nmight be able to go to Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\nHe is much pleased with the conduct of both Houses about his Signature\r\nBill. After dinner Aberdeen read His proposed answer to Leopold to be\r\naddressed to the Residents with a copy of Leopold's letter. It was full of\r\nadmissions, many of which Peel noticed. Aberdeen was going to meet Laval\r\nabout it. I objected to sending a copy of the letter to Leopold, as that\r\nwould as much lead to a reply as if they answered him directly. This the\r\nCabinet seemed to feel; and if there is a letter to the Residents it will\r\nbe printed with the other papers only, and not communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 27._\r\n\r\nPrivy Council at one. The Archbishop of Canterbury ordered to frame a\r\nprayer for the King's recovery.\r\n\r\nCabinet. King's Signature Bill amended. Then Aberdeen read a letter from\r\nthe Residents in Greece giving an account of all that took place from the\r\nnotification of the protocol to the Senate to their adhesion. Unfortunately\r\nthis letter was not sent to Leopold as it ought to have been, when he on\r\nthe 15th sent Capo d'Istria's letter to Aberdeen, and it is thought we\r\ncannot publish it. It shows that the adhesion was entire.\r\n\r\nNo answer to his letter is to be published. We are to wait till we can have\r\na protocol. Laval would not sign any joint letter to the Residents. Being\r\nso near he prefers waiting for the orders of his Court.\r\n\r\nHouse. King's Signature Bill passed, with some amendments. It is to last\r\ntill the end of the Session.\r\n\r\nThe King's command is to be signified by _word of mouth_, a very\r\ninconvenient mode to a sick man.\r\n\r\nEast Retford for a House.\r\n\r\nAll Columbia is at war again. The Mexicans are urging the Haytians to land\r\n5,000 men in Cuba. Peel fears war will begin there by the Americans taking\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald writes from Paris that he thinks the French will not retain\r\nAlgiers. That an energetic demand on our part would have drawn from\r\nPolignac a distinct disavowal of the intention. That he does not think the\r\nchannel (Lord Stuart) a good one.\r\n\r\nI think Fitzgerald would not at all dislike being made Ambassador at Paris.\r\n\r\nIt seems there is a very sore feeling indeed excited by de Peyronnet's\r\nappointment. He thinks the only safety of the Government is in throwing\r\nthemselves upon the ultra-Royalists.\r\n\r\nThe King is a little better. His stomach begins to bear a little light food\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 28._ The account of the King not good.\r\n\r\nCabinet. Found them talking about Scotch boroughs. Aberdeen presented the\r\npapers relative to Leopold in the House. Some conversation as to the\r\ncorrectness in point of form of presenting them printed. The rule is to\r\npresent papers written by the King's command, and to have them printed for\r\nthe immediate use of the House.\r\n\r\nThe Commons passed the King's Signature Bill without a word.\r\n\r\nI thought it necessary to determine at once who should be the new judge at\r\nBombay, and upon full consideration thought Awdry the best man. The\r\nChancellor had no objection, and I immediately wrote to Awdry to tell him I\r\nshould advise the King to appoint him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 29._\r\n\r\nBefore the Cabinet met Hardinge and walked some time up and down Downing\r\nStreet with him. He told me the Duke had proposed an exchange between him\r\nand Lord F. Leveson. Hardinge declined; however, he was at last induced to\r\nacquiesce. There cannot be a better thing for him, for the Government, and\r\nfor Ireland, than his going there. I have always told him so. We may now be\r\nsatisfied things will go on well there. Lord F. Leveson is a mere boy, and\r\nquite unequal to the situation. Hardinge will do admirably and be very\r\npopular. So will she. They will like an Irishwoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 1._\r\n\r\nThe King had a quiet night. In other respects he is much the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 2._\r\n\r\nEmployed all the morning on the Greek papers. Cabinet dinner at Peel's. The\r\nKing rather better. They have opened punctures above the knees. 400 papers\r\nwere stamped. Lord Farnborough was the stamper. The King was perfectly\r\nalive to all that was going on.\r\n\r\nA steamboat has made the passage from Bombay to Suez in a month and two\r\ndays, leaving Bombay on March 20 and reaching Suez on April 22. The letters\r\narrived here on May 31. The steamboat was detained ten days for coals.\r\nThere was no steam conveyance from Alexandria to Malta, so we may reckon\r\nupon gaining fourteen days at least upon this passage. Besides, the steam\r\nvessel was probably a bad one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 3._\r\n\r\nHouse. Aberdeen, in reply to a question of Lord Londonderry's, promised all\r\nthe protocols of Paris! A most voluminous mass of dull twaddle. The House\r\npostponed Miss Hickson's divorce case to Lord Salisbury and East Retford.\r\nWe had only 18 to 69! The Duke seemed very angry, and I heard him speaking\r\nto Lord Bathurst of some peer who went out without voting, whose conduct\r\nseemed to make him very indignant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 4._\r\n\r\nHouse. All seems quiet again. Nothing more said about Leopold. There was to\r\nbe a meeting to-day at Lord Lansdowne's which the Duke of Newcastle was\r\nexpected to attend. Palmerston was at the last. [Footnote: The conjunction\r\nof these names indicated an alliance of Whigs, Canningites, and Tories\r\nirritated by the Roman Catholic Bill.] Rosslyn does not know whether Lord\r\nGrey was.\r\n\r\nThe King not going on well by the bulletin; worse by the private account,\r\nwhich, however, I did not see. He has lost his appetite and grows weaker.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has not yet read my Nagpore letter; but he will to-morrow. He\r\nseems to agree with me in general views upon the subject of our policy\r\ntowards the native States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 5._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. They are dissatisfied with Malcolm for sending a steam vessel\r\ninto the Red Sea, because he had no important intelligence to communicate!\r\nI shall never make these people feel they are at the head of a _State!_\r\n\r\nThe bulletin to-day is very alarming. The Duke had not returned at half-\r\npast 4; but soon after he was seen coming into town looking very\r\nmelancholy. The Duchess of Gloucester arrived an hour later. I thought the\r\nDuke had stayed to be there at the King's death. Knighton sent up to\r\nGoulburn to desire a warrant might be sent down to be stamped conveying the\r\nKing's fines, &c., belonging to the Privy Purse.\r\n\r\nGoulburn very properly refused to send the warrant till he had seen the\r\nDuke. This looks as if they did not expect 24 hours.\r\n\r\nHe was as ill as possible when Aberdeen saw him yesterday for a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nA Cabinet is summoned for half-past 3 to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAll is still again in the House of Commons, as well as with us. They have\r\nfound the Leopold line will not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 6._\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past 3. They all say Scarlett did ill. He did not fight\r\ngallantly, and he fought without judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said he thought the King was _really_ suffering yesterday; but\r\nfrom several circumstances he thought he would live three or four weeks.\r\nThe physicians said eight days. He was better than when Aberdeen saw him on\r\nFriday. No stamping was done. Peel went down to-day. It was hoped some\r\npapers would be stamped. Peel had not returned when the Cabinet separated\r\nat 5.\r\n\r\nAberdeen brought forward the question of a Bill it is thought necessary to\r\nintroduce in consequence of slave-dealing by Brazilian subjects having now\r\nbecome piracy.\r\n\r\nGoulburn seems to be unable to fix any time for the conclusion of the\r\nSession in the event of a demise. I fear it will be necessary to sit a long\r\ntime to get the necessary votes. There are no less than fifty subjects\r\nunvoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 7._\r\n\r\nHouse. In going down met Goulburn, who said the account of the King was\r\nvery bad. Halford had suggested it would be better for the Duke to go down;\r\nwhich he did. Peel thought the King very much changed indeed in the week\r\nwhich had elapsed since he last saw him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 8._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. The diplomatic expenses were carried only by 18, and the\r\nabolition of the punishment of death for forgery was carried by 13. This is\r\na very serious state of things; with such a Parliament there is no\r\ndepending upon the carrying of any measure, and Peel is quite disgusted. As\r\nto the Forgery Bill it will be difficult to find juries to convict when a\r\nmajority has decided against the punishment of death. I am satisfied that\r\nthe property of many will be exposed to much danger by the abolition of the\r\npunishment of death.\r\n\r\nOne Ashe who has libelled the Duke of Cumberland, or written a threatening\r\nletter, will be prosecuted as if he had done the same thing against any\r\nprivate individual.\r\n\r\nThe Fee Bill will be altered in the Committee (which out of delicacy is\r\nindefinitely postponed) and the commissioners continued by endorsement.\r\nThis is a very ingenious device, saving all the difficulty of dealing with\r\npatent offices and of sharing the present fees.\r\n\r\nLord Combermere has written a letter to the Duke explaining and defending\r\nhis conduct. This is a trouble brought upon us by Astell. He has written\r\nrather an impertinent answer to my letter respecting the 600£ for the\r\nRussian papers, or rather some one has written it for him and he has only\r\nsigned it.\r\n\r\nI find Mr. Archibald Campbell, who applied yesterday to me for an\r\nassistant-surgeoncy, is Campbell of Blytheswood, a good voter and a great\r\nfriend of Lord Melville's, and others. I have given him the surgeoncy. I\r\ntold Planta, who is much pleased.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was sent for because the physicians intended to acquaint the King\r\nwith his danger.\r\n\r\nHe was restless yesterday. The bulletin says he passed a very distressing\r\nday. He walked across the room, however, and will probably last some days.\r\n\r\nIn the House, East Retford till 8, when I came away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 9._\r\n\r\nA better bulletin. Office before 12. Settled with Wortley the 'reasons' for\r\nabolishing the College. [Footnote: Haileybury.]\r\n\r\nAt 3 Sir P. Freeling came. Went with him and Wortley to Lord Melville's.\r\nThere will be no difficulty in getting the steam vessel to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nRead Colonel Macdonald's Journal for January, February, and to March 10. It\r\nis not so interesting as the last portion, or rather not so entertaining.\r\nThese make no doubt from the account of Khosroo Murza and of the others who\r\nwent to Petersburg, that the conquest of India by the route of Khiva and\r\nBokhara is the favourite object of the Russians, and the whole people seem\r\nanimated by hatred of England.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner _chez moi_. The Duke did not see the King to-day; the Dukes\r\nof Clarence and Cumberland being there, whom he did not wish to see. The\r\nKing is better. There is coagulated lymph in his legs, one thigh, Tierney\r\nthinks, is a little swelled. He has had no embarrassment of breathing for\r\nthirty-six hours, and slept yesterday as soundly as a child.\r\n\r\nThe man who was with the Queen and the Duke of York when they died is with\r\nthe King now. When the King was sleeping yesterday Knighton said to him,\r\n'This is not the sleep of death!' The other answered, 'Lord, sir! he will\r\nnot die!' They think the King has never thought himself in danger, not even\r\nwhen they told him he was. He seemed flurried, however, or they thought so,\r\nfor a moment, and then they endeavoured to unsay; but the King, who was\r\nquite firm, said, 'No, no! I understand what you think. Call in the Bishop\r\nand let him read prayers.'\r\n\r\nLast night he was talking a great deal to Knighton, and was as amusing as\r\never. In constitution and in mind he is certainly a wonderful man. I have\r\nno doubt that the feeling that he is always in representation makes him\r\nbehave in the face of death as a man would on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 10._\r\n\r\nThe King passed a restless night. He is weaker than he has been yet.\r\n\r\nEast Retford. Salisbury concluded his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 11._\r\n\r\nHouse. I expected to get away immediately; but Lord Londonderry made a\r\nmotion for papers, which led to a discussion of an hour and a half. He was\r\nput down entirely by Aberdeen, who really, with a bad manner, said very\r\ngood things. At last Lord Londonderry chose to say the Contents had it and\r\ndid not divide, so that the motion was negatived _nemine contradicente_.\r\nMost scandalously many went out, not voting against the motion after\r\nAberdeen had declared it would be injurious to the public service to give\r\nthe Papers.\r\n\r\nThe King rather better, but weaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 12._\r\n\r\nChairs. They did not come till half-past 11. I began to think they had\r\ntaken huff and did not mean to come at all, as I had taken no notice of\r\nAstell's letter. However, they came. They do not much like my Nagpore\r\nletter, which it seems is contrary to the line of policy laid down by the\r\nCourt and approved of by Wynne. I told them I took the responsibility upon\r\nmyself. They were ministerial only. My opinion was confirmed by that of\r\nJenkins and of the Duke.\r\n\r\nMet at dinner, at Hardinge's, Arbuthnot, with whom I had some conversation\r\nabout the Report he is writing on the China Evidence. He is to show it to\r\nme. The Duke saw the King, who is much better. The King said he would defer\r\ntaking the sacrament till he was well; but he takes it to-morrow as a\r\n_convalescent_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 13._\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past 3. First considered the line to be adopted on the\r\nForgery Bill, which seems to be to allow it to pass unaltered, throwing the\r\nwhole responsibility on the House of Commons; but Peel is to see the\r\nbankers and merchants that he may ascertain what their opinions are now the\r\nBill has passed the Commons abolishing the punishment of death for forgery.\r\nPeel's idea is that no conviction would be obtained.\r\n\r\nI believe the French and the Russians are so alarmed by the effect produced\r\nin France by the continued exhibition of democratic violence in Greece and\r\nsuccessful rebellion, that they would be disposed to enter into our views\r\nwith respect to the nomination of a prince rather than leave the question\r\nopen; but that they will procrastinate if they find we will unite with them\r\nin giving money which may keep Greece in a state of tranquillity. As to\r\nCapo d'Istria, he first wished to prevent the nomination of any prince and\r\nto keep the government to himself. When he found that would not do, he\r\nendeavoured to frighten Leopold into subserviency; but if he finds he can\r\nget money without having a prince, he will frighten other princes and\r\nremain there himself.\r\n\r\nIt is like paying money in consequence of a threatening letter. If it is\r\ndone once there is no stopping.\r\n\r\nI said I believed the dissolution of the Acarnanian army, happen as it\r\nmight, would be better than its maintenance, and that the state of anarchy\r\ninto which it was pretended Greece would fall if it had not money, would be\r\na better foundation of improvement than the state of military thraldom in\r\nwhich it is now held.\r\n\r\nPeel proposed that Dawkins should be instructed under circumstances of\r\nimminent danger to advance money not exceeding 20,000£, and this would be\r\nthe best way of doing it. The Duke has great repugnance to giving anything,\r\nand objects to doing what might be considered an unconstitutional act. He\r\nhopes Aberdeen will be able to persuade the other Powers to give 30,000£\r\neach, leaving us out of the subscription.\r\n\r\nThe thing was left undetermined. I suggested that it was by no means\r\nimpossible a question might be asked by some 'friend of Greece' whether we\r\nintended to give or had given money in consequence of Capo d'Istria's\r\nrepresentations, and then what we had done would come out. In fact if the\r\nKing was well the matter would be brought before Parliament.\r\n\r\nHis illness creates great embarrassment. It is doubtful whether the\r\nGovernment can command majorities on questions on which a defeat under\r\nordinary circumstances would lead them to resign; but it is known that now\r\nthey cannot resign and cannot dissolve, and the Opposition has no other\r\neffect than that of interfering with the conduct of public business.\r\n\r\nA powerful man would place this strongly before the country and bring the\r\nHouse to a sense of its duty.\r\n\r\nThe Duke showed me the letter he had written to Lord Combermere in reply to\r\nhis, upon my Memorandum. It is _excellent_.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a great fight upon sugar. Charles Grant makes a proposition,\r\nand Goulburn proposes to modify his original proposition by suggesting the\r\naddition of 6_d_. a gallon to Scotch and Irish spirits and to rum, thus\r\nleaving the proportional burthen nearly the same. In addition to this he\r\nproposes lowering the duty on the inferior kinds of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe French Expedition was in Palma Bay on May 31, awaiting the arrival of\r\nthe last division, which was expected the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 15._\r\n\r\nThe King much better. He has been in good spirits about himself, and has\r\nexpectorated, which is thought a good sign.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons Goulburn's altered plans seem to have succeeded\r\nwith all parties as far as first impression goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 16._\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet dinner spoke to Lord Melville and Goulburn about the\r\nembarrassments of the civil servants. Both are very much indisposed to\r\ngrant the papers asked for by Hume on the subject. I shall write to\r\nArbuthnot to do what he can to prevent their being given.\r\n\r\nThe Duke got a number of papers stamped--indeed all the arrears, about 400.\r\nThe King paid more attention to them than he ever did while he was well. He\r\nrecollected everything.\r\n\r\nThe Duke did not think him so well as when he last saw him. The physicians\r\ndo not like this catarrh. The Duke thought his hand was hotter than usual,\r\nthat he was larger, and that altogether he was not so well. His judgment\r\nhas hitherto been so correct that I attach much importance to it.\r\n\r\nPeel spoke after dinner with much _ennui_ of his position in the House of\r\nCommons. He complained that it really was not worth a man's while to be\r\nthere for so many hours every night. The sacrifice was too great. He said\r\nthe Radicals had brought the House into such a state that no man could do\r\nbusiness but themselves. He seemed not well, and thoroughly out of humour.\r\n\r\nWe had some discussion about the Forgery Bill. We are to see the Governor\r\nand deputy-governor of the Bank, &c. The Duke is much indisposed to\r\nacquiesce in the Commons' amendment.\r\n\r\nPeel thinks that after the vote of the House of Commons no verdicts will be\r\nobtained; but may not a contrary vote of the House of Lords turn public\r\nopinion into its former course? I think it may.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 17._\r\n\r\nIn French newspaper a bad report of the French fleet, which is very much\r\ndispersed. One division was in sight of the shore on May 30 when it came on\r\nto blow, and they ran to Majorca. The other divisions will have gone to the\r\nrendezvous on the African shore, where they will have met no men-of-war and\r\nmuch bad weather. The star of Napoleon is set.\r\n\r\nLord Combermere has written another letter to the Duke, in which he\r\nacknowledges his error as to the compact in 1796 and 1801, and says he was\r\nled into it by Col. Fagan. He restates all he before said on the other\r\npoints, and still wishes his letter to go to the King.\r\n\r\nThe King seems to have had a good night. I did not hear the private\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 18._\r\n\r\nReceived last night from Astell a letter in which he speaks of an intended\r\naddress of his respecting the Nagpore letter. I have told him he has\r\nalready privately told me his opinion--that the Act of Parliament has made\r\nno provision for a representation on the part of the Secret Committee if\r\nthey disagree with the Board, and I cannot receive any such representation\r\nofficially. I have further told him that I think any more delay will be\r\ninjurious to the public service.\r\n\r\nWrote a letter to Runjeet Singh to go with the horses. Showed it to Lord\r\nAmherst, Clare, and Auckland. Lord Amherst and Clare were delighted with\r\nit. Showed it to the Duke, who approved. Saw the Duke.\r\n\r\nThe King alarmed the princesses yesterday, but the Duke of Clarence did not\r\nthink him so ill. I saw the Duke of Clarence's letter to the Duke of W.\r\nHalford thinks the expectoration is an additional evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 19._\r\n\r\nAt 11 Privy Council to hear the appeal of Elphinstone (that is, East India\r\nCompany) against Ameerchund Bidruchund, a case of booty. Remained till\r\nhalf-past two, when I was obliged to come away, having a dinner at\r\nRoehampton. Indeed I do not think that upon a point affecting the revenues\r\nof India I ought to vote as a judge.\r\n\r\nBrougham ridiculed the Directors who sat there in a mass, nine of them.\r\nFergusson spoke of \"the Court.\" Brougham said he was not surprised he\r\nshould make that mistake seeing such an array of directors. Brougham put it\r\n_ad verecundiam_ to the directors whether they would vote upon a question\r\nin which they were directly interested, and in which they had already\r\nappeared by Counsel.\r\n\r\nThey were and will be very sulky. They will stay away and decline\r\nsupporting Government.\r\n\r\nThe bulletin is bad.\r\n\r\nTwo most impertinent letters from Lord Arbuthnot and Mr. Arbuthnot asking\r\nfor, or rather _demanding_, cadetships. They will find I am not to be\r\nbullied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 21._\r\n\r\nThe King expectorated blood yesterday. He is failing in strength, and now\r\ncertainly dying.\r\n\r\nRead a memorandum of Wilson's on a proposed remodelling of the army. It is\r\nfounded on my idea of bringing it into the form it formerly had, with fewer\r\nEuropean officers and more native officers, in higher ranks. He proposes\r\nhaving two more European Non-Commissioned officers, a Subadar Major, and\r\nanother Subadar, and several minor things.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 22._\r\n\r\nCabinet. The Duke thought the character of the Government would be affected\r\nif we gave up the Forgery Bill in the Lords, not in consequence of any\r\nchange of opinion, but of a majority of 13 in the House of Commons. I am\r\nsatisfied the law, as it is, ought to be maintained. In the House Lord\r\nLansdowne made a speech on moving the second reading, and Lord Winchelsea\r\nand the Duke of Richmond said they should vote for the Bill as it was--\r\nnone, however, taking religious objections, Lord Lansdowne throwing out\r\nthat he would consent to make the bill temporary. The Chancellor made a\r\nvery good speech, expressing his general objections to the Bill as it\r\nstands, and reserving his reasons for the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe King is rather worse and weaker.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons last night a mine was sprung and all parties, Whigs\r\nand Tories, East and West Indians, united by a trick on the sugar duties.\r\nHowever, we had a majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 23._\r\n\r\nIt seems Peel and Herries and even Goulburn himself rather doubts whether\r\nthe sugar arrangement will work, and Peel has some doubt as to his\r\nmajority. Altogether he is very much out of humour, or rather _ennuyé_, and\r\na very little would induce him to give up.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner. The Duke saw the King and some stamping took place. The\r\nKing was much worse than on Saturday. The expectoration is matter from the\r\nlungs. Knighton says that if they can keep the bowels right he may live a\r\nmonth. Halford says if he was an ordinary man he should think he would not\r\nlive three days. Tierney says his pulse almost failed while he was asleep\r\nthis morning, and he thought he would have died. The Duke says he thinks\r\nmore with Knighton than the others.\r\n\r\nThe King was perfectly alive to all the business done. He talks of going to\r\nthe Cottage still.\r\n\r\nMuch talk at the Cabinet dinner as to what should be done as to\r\ndissolution; but all depends on the time of the King's death, and the state\r\nof public business then.\r\n\r\nPeel, Herries, and all seem to think the Low Party gains, and will gain\r\nstrength. Hume, on Whitbread's retirement, is to come in for Middlesex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 24._\r\n\r\nHouse. Galway Franchise Bill read second time Counsel were to have been\r\nheard; but the petitioners declined having them. I fear we shall have a\r\nsharp debate about it to-morrow, and Lord Grey be directly opposed to the\r\nDuke, and the worst of it is I do not believe our case is very good.\r\n\r\nHardinge and Wortley both say we are in a great scrape with these sugar\r\nduties, and Ireland, which was all with us, is hostile again on account of\r\nthe spirit and stamp duties.\r\n\r\nWalked as far as Mrs. Arbuthnot's with the Duke. He told me his view of the\r\nGalway Franchise Bill, and is very certain of his case. He feels Goulburn\r\nhas satisfied no one with his sugar duties.\r\n\r\nThe King seems much worse by the bulletin; but the private account was not\r\nmuch so. He was said to be worse when Lord Hill left Windsor. I really\r\nbelieve that we are so bothered with sugar duties and other things that an\r\nimmediate demise and immediate dissolution would be best for us, and for\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 25._\r\n\r\nWent to the Duke about the Galway Bill before the House met. The Duke spoke\r\nvery well and made a very good case. Lord Grey well, but the Chancellor\r\ndemolished his speech, and placed the question on such good grounds that it\r\nwas useless to speak afterwards; nor was there much subsequent debate. The\r\nDuke of Buckingham made a speech against us, in which he mistook every\r\npoint, and gave me a great disposition to follow him; but I knew if I did I\r\nshould have a whole hornet's nest upon me, and I wished to keep Durham and\r\nRadnor in check, or answer them. Had I spoken the debate would have lasted\r\nthree hours more. As it was we got away by nine. On the division we had 62\r\nto 47. Not brilliant. Our case was excellent. I had feared it would be\r\nindifferent. The Chancellor had got it up admirably. Lord Londonderry, the\r\nDukes of Newcastle and Richmond, Calthorpe, all the Canningites, of course\r\nvoted against us. Dudley was in the House at one time, but he did not vote\r\nagainst us, nor has he once since he went out.\r\n\r\nThe King much weaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 26._\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight this morning I received a Cabinet box containing the\r\nbulletin signed by Halford and Tierney of the King's death, and Halford's\r\nprivate letter to the Duke of Wellington. The letter stated that the King\r\nhad slept for about two hours and woke a little before three. Soon\r\nafterwards, Sir W. Waller only being in the room, he suddenly put his hand\r\nto his breast, and said, 'Good God, what is the matter? This is death?' He\r\nthen sent for Halford. He and the others came, and so soon afterwards as I\r\nhave said, he expired without the least struggle or pain.\r\n\r\nPeel summoned a Cabinet at half-past ten. We met and talked of very little\r\nbut in what dress we should go to the Council, which was to be at twelve.\r\nIt was agreed we should go in black, shoes and stockings, but not full\r\ndress. However, after I left the room the Duke arrived, and said the King\r\n[Footnote: The Duke of Clarence now became William IV] intended to appear\r\nin uniform, so the Duke, Lord Bathurst, Rosslyn, and Sir J. Murray, who\r\nwere there, put on their uniforms. The group at the Council was most\r\nmotley. Lords Grey, Lansdowne, Spencer, Tankerville, Sir J. Warrender, and\r\nsome others being in black full dress. Lord Camden and some more in\r\nuniform, which several sent for after they arrived, as Salisbury and\r\nHardinge. The mass, however, in plain black, some in colours. The Royal\r\nDukes came in full dress.\r\n\r\nWe waited a long time before the Council, almost two hours, a time occupied\r\nin audiences.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland got the King to send for Lord Eldon, who went in for\r\na minute only. The Duke of Cumberland received his gold stick, and seemed\r\nvery active. The Duke of Wellington, Lord Bathurst, Rosslyn, the\r\nChancellor, and Sir R. Peel went in together, and personally acquainted the\r\nKing with the late King's death. The King said he might not have an\r\nopportunity of seeing that day the rest of his late Majesty's confidential\r\nservants; but he told those present that all had his confidence, and that\r\nthey would receive his _entire, cordial, and determined support_. He told\r\nthe Chancellor in a private audience not only the same thing, but that if\r\nat any time he should hear reports of his ceasing to place confidence in\r\nhis Government, they were not to be believed. If he had any fault to find\r\nhe would at once tell them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke and the others came out from the King we all went to the\r\nball-room, where we began to sign the proclamation, and a few, the Royal\r\nDukes and others, had signed, when we were called to the Privy Council\r\nRoom, where the King soon arrived, attended by the household of the late\r\nKing. He took his seat, and read his declaration. He read it with much\r\nfeeling, and it was well imagined, and will have a good effect. The Lord\r\nPresident entreated it might be printed.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned that before the King came in the Council made the\r\nusual orders, with the addition of an order for defacing the late King's\r\nstamps, which was accordingly done by the clerk of the Council.\r\n\r\nWhen the declaration had been read the King took the Scotch oath in the\r\nusual form, the Lord-President reading it to him, and the King holding up\r\nhis right hand.\r\n\r\nHe then said it was a satisfaction to him to find such a Privy Council, and\r\nrequested them all to take the oath.\r\n\r\nThis the Royal Dukes did first, then the Speaker, that he might go to the\r\nHouse of Commons. Then the Archbishop and the Chancellor together, then the\r\nDukes, with the Lord President and Privy Seal, then the Marquises, then\r\nothers according to their rank. When all had taken the Privy Councillor's\r\noath the Lord Chancellor took his, and the Clerk of the Council was sworn\r\nby the Lord President. The King then retired, and the Council ordered as\r\nusual respecting the disposal of the late King's body.\r\n\r\nAfter the swearing in we signed the Proclamation. Some remained to alter\r\nthe Liturgy. Queen Adelaide is to be prayed for, and the rest of the Royal\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk was there as Earl Marshal. He observed he was the only\r\nperson there who was not a Privy Councillor, and expressed a wish to be\r\none. The Duke mentioned it to the King, who readily assented. He observed\r\nthere had been no Duke of Norfolk a member of the Privy Council since the\r\ntime of James II., and that that Duke of Norfolk was a Protestant. The Duke\r\nof Norfolk, however, will consider the oath before he takes it. He would\r\nhave taken the Earl Marshal's oath to-day, but it was not there.\r\n\r\nWe met in Cabinet at 4.\r\n\r\nThe only innovations I yet hear of are in the dress of regiments. The King\r\nintends, as he told Lord Farnborough, to live at Windsor. He intends to\r\nhave a battalion of the Guards at Edinburgh, and a regiment of the Line at\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\nI went in, by some misdirection, the wrong way, and found Wood and Sir Ch.\r\nPole waiting for the King. Wood, whom I met near the Horse Guards, as I was\r\nriding down to the Cabinet, told me the King had rehearsed his declaration\r\nto him, Sir Ch. Pole, and Lord Errol, before he went into the Privy\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThere was no grief in the room in which we waited. It was like an ordinary\r\n_levée_.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor went down to the House between the Cabinet and the Council,\r\nand took the oaths.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Steward was sent for by Peel, and only arrived a quarter before\r\nfour at the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nLord Holland, Grey, and others seemed to think the Proclamation ought to\r\nhave been made to-day, and I think it might have been just as well.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was much cheered by the people. The Duke was called\r\nout of the Cabinet to see Halford, but we had a long conversation as to the\r\ncourse to be pursued with respect to the Parliament, and especially with\r\nrespect to the Regency question.\r\n\r\nThe House must sit next week, as the sugar duties expire on Saturday next,\r\nand Goulburn seems disposed to propose a Bill for the continuance of the\r\npresent duties for a time; to take money on account for miscellaneous\r\nservices; to throw over the judicial Bills and end the session at once.\r\n\r\nThe stumbling block is the Regency question--whether it should be brought\r\nforward now, and if brought forward, who shall be Regent.\r\n\r\nPeel seems to think we can hardly avoid bringing it on; as the session\r\nwould have lasted two months in the event of the late King's living, why\r\nshould it not now, when the reason for Parliament sitting is so much\r\ngreater? And what would be the situation of the country if the King should\r\ndie, leaving a minor Queen?\r\n\r\nPeel suggested appointing the Queen Regent for a year. I said, depend upon\r\nit, when the King once has her as Regent he will never consent to change\r\nher, and if you appoint her for a year you appoint her for the whole time.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards suggested her appointment for a year after the King's death\r\non account of the probability of her pregnancy. To this I objected, the\r\nstate of distraction in which the country would be placed during that year.\r\nIt is impossible consistently with the constitution to have an Executive,\r\nof which the existence shall be dependent on the good pleasure of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nPeel then suggested the giving to the King the power of naming either the\r\nQueen, the Duchess of Kent, or any member of the Royal family. The\r\nobjection to this is that he ought to name one of the two first--that we\r\ngot no security against a bad nomination, which we ought to do.\r\n\r\nThe views we ought to have are these: to give all possible strength to the\r\nmonarchy. This we do not, if we permit a frequent change of the Executive;\r\nif we diminish the power of the Crown while in the hands of a Regency. We\r\nwant to give stability to the Government, and this can only be given by\r\nmaking the Queen Regent. If we do that we provide, as far as human wisdom\r\ncan, for a stable Government of seven years.\r\n\r\nWe can in no case _name_ any other person than the Queen, because she may\r\nbecome pregnant, and in that event it would be monstrous to make the\r\nDuchess of Kent Regent. All we can do, then, is to give the King the option\r\nof choosing the Queen or the Duchess of Kent. He will name the Queen, and\r\nshe will be the best.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that all Kings of England die either on Saturdays or\r\nSundays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 27._\r\n\r\nCame up to a Cabinet at half-past three. We had a great deal of\r\nconversation as to the course to be pursued. The Chancellor said that in\r\nthe event of a minor succeeding to the throne, all the minor's acts would\r\nbe valid, and under the responsibility of ministers the Great Seal might be\r\nput in the minor's name by the minor's sign manual to an Act creating a\r\nRegency.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to take the opinion of the Attorney- and Solicitor-\r\nGeneral upon this point.\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that the law is as the Chancellor states, we considered\r\nwhat should be done. All turns upon our being able to get a temporary Act\r\nfor the sugar duties, and if we cannot get that we are _really_ no longer a\r\nGovernment. It was determined to carry through the Beer Bill and Beer Duty\r\nBill, to throw over Stamps in Ireland, and carry Spirits. To take a sum of\r\n800,000£ on account of miscellaneous estimates, and 250,000£ on account of\r\nthe civil list.\r\n\r\nThese last points were decided at a Cabinet at Sir R. Peel's, which\r\nassembled at eleven, and sat till near one; at which the Attorney- and\r\nSolicitor-General delivered their opinion, in conformity with that of the\r\nChancellor as to the legal competency of a minor sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General reminded us that if the King died before the new\r\nParliament assembled, the old Parliament would revive.\r\n\r\nPeel talked a good deal of the Regency. He is much in favour of making the\r\nQueen Regent for a year after the King's death, to provide for the possible\r\npregnancy. It seems the principle of all Regencies has been to make the\r\nguardian of the person Regent. It is curious that the case should never\r\nhave been provided for of a Queen being left pregnant of an heir apparent,\r\nand that it should never have occurred. The difficulty would be infinite.\r\n\r\nI consider the death of the King to have been one of the fortunate events\r\nwhich have often saved the Duke of Wellington. I really do not know how we\r\ncould have gone on, had he lived two months.\r\n\r\nThe King wishes to make Lord Combermere a Privy Councillor, thinking all\r\ngold sticks have been so. We find he is misinformed, and the Duke means to\r\nshow him the list of gold-sticks not Privy Councillors, and at the same\r\ntime to tell him how Lord Combermere stands, having within these few months\r\nbeen censured by the Government. The Duke will show the King the\r\ncorrespondence which passed lately, and leave it to him to decide. There\r\nwould be no objection to making him a Privy Councillor some months or a\r\nyear hence.\r\n\r\nBrougham made a violent speech against Lord Conyngham for not being in\r\nreadiness to swear in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 28._\r\n\r\nWent to St. James's at eleven. The Household, the Royal family, and the\r\nMinisters only were there. The King was dressed in plain black. He went to\r\na large window looking into the courtyard, and stood forward. There were\r\nbut few people there at first, the Horse Guards and the Heralds. The King's\r\nband played God Save the King, and those who were there cheered, upon which\r\nnumbers of people came round from before the Palace and filled the\r\ncourtyard. They then cheered well.\r\n\r\nAs the King passed through the line we formed for him to go to the window\r\nhe came up to me and said he must begin by chiding me for not coming to him\r\nyesterday. In fact he had forgot I was a Cabinet Minister, and he therefore\r\nwould see me to-day. I said 'it was my first and I hoped it would be my\r\nlast fault.' After the Proclamation he sent for the Duke of Wellington, and\r\nwhen the Duke left him, for me. He asked about China. I told him how we\r\nstood there. That there was an interruption which would probably prevent\r\nthe arrival of any ships this year; that orders had been given for a double\r\ninvestment next year. I said the state of affairs generally was by no means\r\nsatisfactory. The King said he was afraid Lord W. Bentinck had not been\r\ndoing well. I said I feared he had let down the dignity of his office, and\r\nhad when he first went there run after popularity too much, and allowed the\r\npress to get ahead. It would now be very difficult to check it. I added\r\nthat he went to make great reductions and had made some. That that had\r\nrendered him unpopular. He was honest and well-meaning. The King said he\r\nshould go down to Bushey soon, and as I was living near he would have me\r\nover at eleven o'clock some morning, and give me some hours to make him\r\nacquainted with the state of India. I told him of the secret letter to the\r\nBengal Government about the Nagpore Treaty, and the principles laid down,\r\nof which he highly approved. He then expressed apprehension of Russia. I\r\ntold him all that had been done upon that subject, and of the present to\r\nRunjeet Singh, and the navigation of the Indus, with all which he seemed\r\nmuch pleased. I said I would send him the secret letters, and get together\r\ninformation that would bring the whole state of India before him as\r\nconcisely as possible. As I was led to mention Sir J. Macdonald, I asked a\r\ncoat for him, and the King granted it, thinking it very proper.\r\n\r\nThe Duke attends the opening of the King's will at 12.\r\n\r\nThe late King died, as was thought, of fatness about the heart. The dropsy\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nCabinet. We had none at St. James's, but there was a council. The Duke of\r\nNorfolk attended to be sworn in as a Privy Councillor. We found, on\r\nreference to the Act of last session, that he must have taken the oath\r\nwithin three months before his receiving any office of trust or profit. So,\r\non my proposal, the Petty Bag was sent for, and the Chancellor held a court\r\nof Chancery in the ball-room, where the Duke took the oath. He was\r\nafterwards sworn in, as were the Duke of Bedford, Sir S. Canning, Sir J.\r\nMackintosh, Lord Bexley, and two or three others who were not in time\r\nyesterday. There were a good many orders in council, but of no moment.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual proclamation against vice and immorality.\r\n\r\nThe King did very well. He was very gracious to all who approached him, and\r\nhad something to say to every one. He took little notice of Sir. J.\r\nMackintosh.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst had to change a sheriff. The King, when he heard the name of\r\nthe new one (sheriff of Suffolk, I think), said, _'He is a Whig.'_ Lord\r\nBathurst said, 'He is a very good man, I believe, Sir, and is recommended\r\nby the Duke of Grafton.' 'Oh!' said the King, 'I do not mean to say it is\r\nwrong; only remember, _he is a Whig_.'\r\n\r\nAfter the council we went to Peel's, but we remained but a short time, the\r\nDuke going to the House and Peel too before 4. In our House not a word was\r\nsaid. In the Commons Brougham, who seems, as Frankland Lewis told me, half\r\nfrantic, made rather an apologetic speech for his attack upon the Lord\r\nSteward, but again hinted at intentional disrespect towards the House of\r\nCommons, not on the part of Ministers in that House, but of persons\r\nelsewhere. He reminded Peel that whatever accession of strength Ministers\r\nmight have recently obtained, they could not carry on the Government\r\nwithout the confidence of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHis speech was very mysterious, and hardly any one understood it. Some\r\nthought he alluded to the accession of Lord Grey to the Government; that\r\nmust have rested upon foolish rumour. He alluded, I conclude, to the King's\r\nsupport, now well known. What symptoms of disrespect for the House of\r\nCommons he may have discovered I know not. Probably he chooses to imagine\r\nthem, to produce an effect.\r\n\r\nHe is evidently mad with disappointment. He could not well be wooed in such\r\na temper, even if he were to be wooed at all.\r\n\r\nAfter the House I rode to leave my name at the Princess Augusta's, and\r\nforgot the Duke of Cumberland, who lives close by; then I went to the Duke\r\nof Gloucester's, where I met F. Lewis, who told me of Brougham's speech and\r\nso on. I went with Wood to the Princess Sophia of Gloucester's. He told me\r\nall the King said of the late King's error in not frankly supporting his\r\nGovernment, and of his own determination to do so. He had been long in the\r\nhabit of saying, 'the Queen is not with child.' There had been a report to\r\nthat effect. Rode to the Duchess of Kent's and Duke of Sussex's. Met Lord\r\nGraham, Mr. and Mrs. Arbuthnot, and the Chancellor. Rode on with the\r\nChancellor to Kensington. As we were coming away from the Palace we heard\r\nthe trampling of horses behind us, and turning round, saw the King coming\r\nfull tilt with his lancers; we had but just time to wheel round and salute\r\nHis Majesty, who seemed much amused at seeing two of his Ministers amongst\r\nall the little children who were running by his carriage, and the\r\nChancellor, so lately in all the gravity of his official robes, mounted on\r\na little white New Forest pony of Lady Lyndhurst's. I rode on to\r\nRoehampton, dined there, and rode back.\r\n\r\nAt 10 a Cabinet at Peel's. We framed the message. Peel was very flat. The\r\nmeasure of immediate dissolution is one he does not half approve. He wished\r\nto settle the Regency question. He has been put out of humour by having his\r\nopinions upon that point not at once acquiesced in. He sees all the\r\ndifficulties of our position, and does not meet them with energy and\r\n_elan_. He certainly is not an agreeable person to transact business with,\r\nbut he is a very able man.\r\n\r\nThe accounts from Ireland are very bad. The potatoes are exhausted at\r\nLimerick, Tralee, and other places, and the new crop will not come in till\r\nAugust. At Limerick some stores have been forced, and the troops attacked\r\nwith stones.\r\n\r\nAt Tralee there was a subscription of 450£ for the purchase of potatoes;\r\n300£ was expended, and the Mayor of Tralee and other _gentlemen_ bought\r\nsome of these potatoes, which were offered at a reduced price to the\r\npeople, for _seed_! Can any country be tranquil in which resident gentlemen\r\ncan do such things? A discretionary power has been given to the Lord\r\nLieutenant to expend 3000£ in food, should it become necessary, without\r\nfurther reference.\r\n\r\nAbout 180 peers have taken the oaths. I fear we shall be beaten upon the\r\nForgery Bill; we have a very narrow margin indeed, not above six or eight\r\nwithout bishops. It is supposed the bishops will stay away. I fear those\r\nwill stay away who would, if present, vote with us, and all who are against\r\nwill come. If this should be the case we must be defeated.\r\n\r\nThe King was perfectly reasonable about Lord Combermere. The Duke showed\r\nHis Majesty the letters which had passed, and the King said he should not\r\nthink of it. He told Peel and Lord Melville he wished the Royal Academy to\r\nremain open till after the King's funeral, that he might see the\r\nexhibition, and said Peel should attend him when he went. This Peel thinks\r\nvery foolish, and his disposition seems to be to turn the King into\r\nridicule, and to throw the suspicion of insanity upon all his acts. This is\r\nthe _tactique_ of the Whigs. The King takes the Sacrament on Sunday, and\r\nhas desired the two English and one Irish archbishop to attend. This they\r\ncall 'an indication.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 29._\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten went to Lord Rosslyn's, to arrange with him the Lords'\r\nAddress. Went with him to Peel's, to show it to him. He was reading when we\r\nwent in, and hardly looked up. He heard the Address which I read, and\r\napproved of it; but he hardly took any notice of us or of it. He seemed\r\nreally ill, and quite broken down.\r\n\r\nCalled on Hardinge. We had some conversation respecting the state of the\r\nGovernment. His idea is that the strength of the Government in the House of\r\nCommons is much injured by Peel's being in a subordinate situation to the\r\nDuke. That if he was Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, things would go on better, the Duke taking a secretaryship of\r\nState. This would do very well in the House of Commons, but very ill in the\r\nCabinet. He is for getting Mr. Stanley, and suggests (or Rosslyn did, or\r\nboth, for having talked to both on the same subject I may confound them)\r\nthat Lord F. Leveson should be made a peer. I think that a good idea. He is\r\nof no use in the Commons, and his peerage would open a place which Mr.\r\nStanley could fill.\r\n\r\nRosslyn thinks Aberdeen's notions upon foreign politics have, together with\r\nhis assumption of independence which is of recent date, made the Duke\r\nrather sore, and that he would not be sorry to have another Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs. Lord Rosslyn wants to have Lord Grey in, and\r\nsays he would as soon be First Lord of the Admiralty as Foreign Secretary.\r\nRosslyn would, I think, like to go to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant. He would\r\nwillingly give up the Privy Seal to Aberdeen. He thinks Sir G. Murray would\r\nmake an excellent Governor General. I fear he would be too indolent. He\r\nsaid he knew, if there was a vacancy, the Duke would be glad to make him\r\nMaster General.\r\n\r\nI had said I believed Lord Beresford would go to Portugal as Minister, if\r\nMiguel would be on good terms with us. It seems Goulburn would be glad to\r\nbe Speaker. That would open a proper office for Herries, and his offices\r\nmight be divided, Lord Althorpe having the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nI really think some arrangement must be made to give us strength in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Saw the Duke at two. He approved of the address. Rosslyn,\r\nwas with him. I told him how ill Peel seemed. He said he would go to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHouse. The Duke moved the Address. He gave a character of the late King as\r\none of the most accomplished, able, and remarkable men of the age. I saw\r\nLord Grey smile a little, but the House generally was grave and formal.\r\nLord Grey assented to the Address, but _laissait entrevoir_ that he should\r\nbe hostile to the Address to-morrow, hinting at the Regency. The same thing\r\nwas done in the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told me the late King had three disorders which must have proved\r\nfatal, and he died of bursting a blood-vessel in the stomach. He had a\r\nconcretion as large as an orange in his bladder, his liver was diseased,\r\nand his heart was ossified. Water there was not much, and all proceeding\r\nfrom the interruption of circulation about the heart. I read the report,\r\nsigned by Halford, Tierney, Brodie, and A. Cooper.\r\n\r\nWe had East Retford again. Lord Londonderry, whom Lord Durham puts forward\r\nas his tool, moved an adjournment. The question was postponed till Friday.\r\nAfterwards the Duke of Buckingham, when most peers had gone away, moved the\r\nsame thing, and then Lord Londonderry twice. We had majorities but gave it\r\nup at last. The Chancellor is heartily tired of the whole thing. The Duke\r\nwent away while Lord Londonderry was explaining in answer to his speech, to\r\nthe noble Lord's great annoyance.\r\n\r\nI rode home with the Duke, who spoke of Lord Londonderry as a madman. He\r\nsaid Peel had not taken a sufficiently high line. He did not like the\r\nposition he stood in in the House of Commons. The Duke said no Government\r\nwas ever beaten by its enemies, but many have been by their friends.\r\n\r\nThe King was very amenable and good-natured to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 30._\r\n\r\nOccupied all the morning in looking at the precedents in the case of\r\nregency. There are two modern contradictory precedents, 24 Geo. II. and 5\r\nGeo. III., and no experience of either, nor has there been a minority since\r\nEdward VI. in 1547.\r\n\r\nIt is clear the sovereign is sovereign whatever be his age, and the Act\r\nappointing a regent must have his assent. Whatever has at any time been\r\ndone, has been done or sanctioned by Parliament. Parliament cannot\r\nsupersede the Royal authority.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that Parliament in 1811 made provision for the care of the\r\nKing's person in case of his death; but none for the care of the kingdom in\r\nthe event of the Regent's death, although the Princess Charlotte was but\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\nHouse at 5. The Duke moved the Address in a very short speech, not\r\nadverting to the regency. Lord Grey followed and declared his opinion of\r\nthe incapacity of Government as exhibited in their measures during the last\r\nfive months. Goderich said 'nothing had been done,' and was for going on\r\nwith the business. Lord Harrowby wished a short Regency Bill to be passed,\r\ngiving the regency to the Queen for six weeks, to provide for the case of\r\npregnancy. The Chancellor made a speech, not long, admitting the law to be\r\nas stated, that is, that the sovereign immediately on accession possessed\r\nall Royal power. Eldon spoke against us, and treated the question of a King\r\n_en venire sa mere_ with jocularity. I followed, and observed gravely upon\r\nhis jocularity on such a subject; then stated my view of the question, and\r\nexpressed my regret and surprise at Lord Grey's declaration, added I was\r\nhappy to know at last where we were, who were our friends and who were our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThen got up the Duke of Richmond, totally misrepresenting what I had said\r\nas to Lord Eldon and Lord Grey, and endeavouring to make them appear as\r\npersonal attacks to which no gentleman could submit. Lord Londonderry\r\nfollowed in the same tone. (After the Duke of Richmond I explained that I\r\nhad not attributed improper motives to Lord Grey, nor attacked Lord Eldon's\r\ncharacter.) We had afterwards Lord Lansdowne, Lord Harewood giving his\r\nfirst vote for the Government after the Catholic Question, and _that_\r\nbecause it was the first measure of the new King. A foolish reason, but I\r\ndare say many voted on the same ground. Lord Wharncliffe spoke against us,\r\nLords Bute and Wicklow and the Duke of Buckingham for us, Lord Radnor\r\nshortly against. The Duke replied. Then Lord Grey spoke, and observed, of\r\ncourse, upon what I had said, but not angrily, and I made an explanation\r\nwhich was satisfactory, and set us quite right again. He had imagined me to\r\nsay he owed a debt of gratitude to the Government for the measure of last\r\nsession. I said he had expressed gratitude, but we had not claimed it,\r\nbecause we only did our duty. In the lobby during the debate Lord Jersey\r\ntold me he was afraid Lord Grey might have misunderstood the meaning of\r\nwhat I said about gratitude, and begged me to set him right immediately if\r\nit was so.\r\n\r\nWe had 100 to 54. A very good division. We went, at ten, to Goulburn's to\r\ndinner, and expected soon to see the members of the House of Commons, and\r\nto hear of as good a division there as in the Lords, but after an hour we\r\nheard the division had only been 185 to 139. This made us a little flat,\r\nand Lord Bathurst drank no more champagne.\r\n\r\nI intentionally committed the Government thoroughly with the Whigs, for\r\nafter Lord Grey's declaration it was idle to expect a vote from them, and\r\nour people were pleased, as I knew they would be. The Duke of Bedford and\r\nLord Jersey voted with us. So did Dudley.\r\n\r\nI shall have work enough now, as they have ten or twelve speakers, and we\r\nbut three.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 1._\r\n\r\nLooked over the debates on the Forgery Bill this morning. Committee at one.\r\nExamined a manufacturer of camlets and bombazines from Norwich. House.\r\nForgery Bill. The Chancellor made an admirable speech, Lord Lansdowne\r\nfollowed him, then Lords Wynford, Tenterden, and Eldon all against the\r\nbill. We divided 77 to 20. The Duke was delighted, he said, '_How very\r\nright we were._' So said the Chancellor. Peel would have given it up. Now,\r\nI think one large majority will set public opinion right again. The\r\nChancellor said all that was contained in Peel's two speeches and much\r\nmore. Peel and Brougham were under the throne.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst, with whom I walked home from the House at three, when we\r\ntalked of Goulburn's becoming Speaker, suggested Hardinge as Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer. He would be an excellent one.\r\n\r\nI met Goulburn in the Park this morning. He did not seem much pleased with\r\nthe House last night. I see there were strong words indeed in the second\r\ndebate, Brougham talking of the _parasites_ of the Duke of Wellington. Peel\r\nasked whether he presumed to call him a parasite? There was great\r\nconfusion, and it ended by Peel's making an explanation for Brougham, in\r\nwhich Brougham acquiesced. Several members, amongst the rest, I hear,\r\nCastlereagh, were going to call Brougham out.\r\n\r\nIn the House Lord Bathurst told me Wortley had stayed away from the\r\ndivision last night, and had sent in his resignation. Soon after I received\r\na note from Wortley telling me so, expressing great regret that he could\r\nnot vote for a course of measures which excluded a Regency Bill. His regret\r\nwas increased by my kindness and encouragement. I have sent his letter to\r\nthe Duke, having shown it to Lord Bathurst in the House. I wrote an answer\r\nto say I felt great regret at his not being able to adopt our line, and\r\nexpressing my personal regret at losing him, and my acknowledgments for the\r\nassistance I had derived from him.\r\n\r\nHis father and father-in-law both voted against us last night. He says in\r\nhis note he has taken his line entirely on his own view.\r\n\r\nI had some talk with Dudley in the lobby of the House. I began by saying he\r\nhad acted very handsomely by us. He said he was friendly to the Government,\r\nand above all things unfriendly to Lord Grey and the Duke of Newcastle. The\r\nmotion of last night he called pure faction.\r\n\r\nSalisbury told me he stayed away to-night not liking to vote against us, on\r\naccount of yesterday's declaration of war. The Duke of Gordon told me he\r\nwas much pleased with me last night. I do not, however, think I spoke as\r\nwell as usual.\r\n\r\nBankes I had some talk with. He said the Duke of Cumberland was hostile to\r\nthe Duchess of Kent and Leopold. He would prefer the Queen as Regent. He\r\nhad been much with the King for the last six weeks, and there was a good\r\nunderstanding between them. Bankes asked if I had left my name with him. I\r\ntold him I had, and I believed all the rest had. By some mistake of a\r\nservant the summons to the Privy Council did not reach the Duke of\r\nCumberland till the day after the accession, and he was very angry. It had\r\nbeen sent to Kew. He is satisfied now. Goulburn has hit upon a _mezzo\r\ntermine_ which answers for the present session. He has reduced the duty on\r\nWest Indian sugar to 24,9., and on East Indian sugar to 32s. The duty on\r\nother sugar to be 63s. I did not fail to tell Dudley and Bankes in what\r\nstrong terms the King had expressed his determination to support the\r\nGovernment. They were both 'colpiti.' Dudley had had no idea terms so\r\nstrong had been used. He comes to the Council to be sworn in on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 2._\r\n\r\nChairs at eleven. They have sent a representation on the subject of the\r\nKattywar draft, impugning, as I understand, for I have not yet read it, the\r\npower of the Board to give orders in the Secret Department which do not\r\nrequire secresy.\r\n\r\nI told the Chairs distinctly that I intended to take upon the King's\r\nGovernment the whole responsibility of the foreign policy of India.\r\n\r\nI saw Wortley, who thanked me very much indeed for my note of yesterday\r\nevening. He was much distressed, and evidently regrets extremely that he\r\nhas tendered his resignation. He adheres, however, to his opinion that the\r\nRegency question should have been settled at least provisionally before\r\nParliament separated. He was going to see Peel and afterwards the Duke.\r\n\r\nHe told me the Government could not be conducted in the House of Commons\r\nunless some more Ministers would speak-that there must be a change.\r\n\r\nI called at Hardinge's. He told me the same thing, and that he had talked\r\nabout it to the Duke yesterday and made him promise to place the\r\nministerial seats in the House of Commons at Peel's disposal. Hardinge is\r\nfor having Edward Stanley. He spoke of Wilmot Horton, but he is not of\r\nCabinet calibre. I think Hardinge is disposed to displace Murray rather\r\nthan either of the others. He talked again of making Peel First Lord of the\r\nTreasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Duke Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs--Aberdeen going to Ireland. Aberdeen would not go\r\nthere, I think. I told Hardinge Lord Bathurst had suggested him as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. He would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nIt seems Brougham was almost drunk the other night. Hardinge and several\r\nothers were getting up to question him when Peel stopped them. He pulled\r\nHardinge down by the coat. Hardinge says Peel managed admirably.\r\n\r\nIn the House spoke to the Chancellor and Lord Bathurst, and told them I had\r\nheard we must have an addition of strength to the Treasury Bench. They both\r\nsaid they believed so too. Lord Bathurst again mentioned Hardinge.\r\n\r\nSpoke to the Duke about Wortley. He said he had written a kind note to him,\r\nand told him he had been too hasty. He should have spoken to some of the\r\nMinisters first. The Duke evidently intends the thing to blow over.\r\n\r\nSpoke to Lord Wharncliffe about the same thing. He said he would neither\r\nhave voted nor have spoken against Government on Wednesday if he had had an\r\nidea of Wortley's resigning, because it gave the appearance of concert, and\r\nthere really was none. He did not know of the letters till after they had\r\nbeen written. I said Lord Harrowby's taking the same line, both voting and\r\nspeaking, gave the appearance of concert. He said he thought Wortley\r\naltogether wrong. That a young man, having joined a Government, had no\r\nright, for a difference on a single point, to resign. If he differed upon a\r\nsystem of policy it was another thing. I said I thought it would be allowed\r\nto blow over. He afterwards talked to the Duke, and I have no doubt Wortley\r\nwill remain.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst says W. Horton is a gentleman. I doubted it. He rather wishes\r\nto have Wilmot in office. But the person to be got is Mr. Stanley.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion on a motion of Lord Londonderry's whether we should\r\nproceed with East Retford or not. I followed Lord Grey and spoke very\r\nquietly but, I think, reasonably, for going on. I said if we were obliged\r\nto postpone any measure, the last we should postpone should be one deeply\r\ninteresting to the House of Commons and affecting their privileges.\r\n\r\nI think we did all Peel could require. We had 45 to 13. I remained till\r\neight, but I could stay no longer.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry attacked me again, and said instead of planting a dagger\r\nin the side of Lord Grey I should have applied a _healing plaster!_ His\r\ncomparative civility to the Government to-day was to conciliate their\r\nsupport to Sir R. Gresley for Durham.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told Hardinge yesterday I was always ready. I was a little too\r\nlively, but I was of great use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 3._\r\n\r\nThe King has done two popular things. He has allowed a passage to be made\r\nfrom Waterloo Place into the Park, and he has dismissed all the late King's\r\nFrench cooks! He will have no foreigners about him.\r\n\r\nThe foreign Ministers were all introduced to him to-day. He was very\r\ngracious, Aberdeen said, but he did not choose his topics quite so well as\r\nthe late King, who had much tact and grace, neither does the King speak\r\nFrench well.\r\n\r\nLord Combermere came and had an audience to present a picture of the King\r\nof Delhi, painted by an Indian artist. It seemed not ill done, and had the\r\nappearance of an ordinary picture, but when placed against the light was a\r\ntransparency. Lord Combermere did not remain long with the King, and when\r\nhe came out he seemed annoyed. He remained some time, and the Duke was\r\nafraid he remained to be sworn in, in consequence of some incautious\r\npromise of the King. It was arranged that Buller, who had a list of the\r\nPrivy Councillors, should turn him out with the rest who were not so, when\r\nthe Council began. However, he went away a little before.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Montrose has resigned, and the King has placed the office at\r\nthe disposal of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nPeel seems to think Lord Graham is dissatisfied and unfriendly. It seems he\r\nhas been heard complaining of vacillation, &c., on the part of the\r\nGovernment, and does not attend well.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has named Lady Wellesley and Mrs. Berkeley Paget as two Ladies of\r\nthe Bed-chamber. Valletort is to be in some high situation about the Queen.\r\nLord Errol, her Master of the Horse.\r\n\r\nI conclude Lord Conyngham will resign, but it is not known.\r\n\r\nThe Duke goes to Windsor to-morrow respecting the late King's papers, the\r\nDuke of Cumberland having meditated an _enlèvement_.\r\n\r\nPeel thinks Brougham really rather mad, and would not be surprised to hear\r\nhe was confined. Last year he was melancholy, and his friends and _he\r\nhimself_ feared he might commit suicide. Now he is in an excited state.\r\nPeel speaks of him as a most wonderful man in ability.\r\n\r\nIt seems that last night the leaders came down to make an attack, but the\r\nfollowers, not having been consulted, would not support. R. Gordon came\r\nover to Herries and said he should vote with Government. Hume, who in the\r\nmorning had sent to ask Planta whether Government intended to oppose him\r\nfor Middlesex (a question Planta was desired not to answer till the end of\r\nnext week), was very civil, and disposed to let business pass. It is not\r\nimpossible that the House of Commons may have done their business by this\r\nday week.\r\n\r\nI am to look at the Beer Bill, and have already begun to read the Commons'\r\ndebates upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 4._\r\n\r\nRead all the debates on the Beer Bill, made notes, and considered the\r\nsubject. The Queen seems to have selected her maids of honour from the\r\nneighbourhood of Bushey. This is amiable and very right.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 5._\r\n\r\nI proposed to Wortley, as Edward Stanley was an acquaintance of his, to\r\ngive him a hint not to commit himself against the Government just now; but\r\nhe says he does not know Stanley intimately enough.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether he did not find the Duke of Wellington very kind. He\r\nreally had the kindest heart of any man I ever knew. When I looked up I saw\r\nthe tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nClare told me he heard all the Whigs in our House, except Lord Lansdowne,\r\nwere determined to push us _à l'outrance_; but Lord Lansdowne thought the\r\nDuke must endeavour to strengthen himself during the vacation. He could not\r\ndo it now, as it would be a confession of weakness; but he thought he would\r\ndo it before Parliament met. However, the others would not hear him.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting at Lord Althorpe's yesterday, but I have not heard the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nTalked to Clare about the affairs of Kattywar, and promised to give him\r\nprecise instructions before he left England.\r\n\r\nHe will remain at Bombay, I think. He tells his mother three years, but he\r\nwill remain till he has made some money and done something worth going\r\nthere to do. He has got Elphinstone to make a list of the civil servants\r\n_with their characters_.\r\n\r\nThe King took the sacrament yesterday with the Royal Family, and afterwards\r\nreceived the bishops and the judges. He made long speeches to both. Thirty\r\nminutes to the first, and twenty to the second.\r\n\r\nPolignac seems quite firm, although certain he shall be in a minority of 1\r\nto 2 or 3. It is expected he will _evade_, and that Villele may be able to\r\ngo on with the new Chamber.\r\n\r\nNo news from Algiers. 15,000 men are assembled at Toulon as a reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 6._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Peel said the Lord Advocate would resign if we did not pass the\r\nScotch Judicature Bill, so we must struggle through with it. The Welsh\r\nJudicature Bill is to be passed too. This will keep us sitting some time.\r\nThe Commons will have finished on Friday.\r\n\r\nHouse. We had the second reading of the Beer Bill. I said a few words to\r\nshow the inaccuracy of one of Lord Malmesbury's conclusions; but I must\r\nspeak in detail in the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 7._\r\n\r\nLast night we had 247 to 93, a great division. The Tories in general voting\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nLooked over again all the papers relative to the Beer Bill.\r\n\r\nIn my way back from Roehampton met Lord Ravensworth, who told me the King\r\nhad the gout, and that he had given the Guelphic ribbon to his three sons-\r\nin-law. He likewise told me what I knew before, that the Duke of Montrose\r\nhad resigned.\r\n\r\nI told him of the dismissal of the French cooks, which horrified him.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Herries's. All the House of Commons pleased with their\r\ndivision. They got three county members to speak for others. The Whigs did\r\nnot like the motion, and were unwilling to divide. Robert Grant divided the\r\nHouse. The King was delighted with the division.\r\n\r\nHe came to town to-day, almost for nothing, and received the Duke and\r\nothers. He sent for Lord Rosslyn and told, him he had made his regiment the\r\nQueen's Own.\r\n\r\nHe has changed the uniform of the navy, which is to be blue with red cuffs\r\nand facings. He wore the uniform so to-day.\r\n\r\nAberdeen introduced Prince William of Prussia. The King desired him to\r\nstay, and said he should never receive foreigners except in his presence,\r\nand never but in his naval uniform. He should wear the military uniform now\r\nand then, but as little as possible.\r\n\r\nAll the cavalry are to be in red.\r\n\r\nNo news from Algiers. The Duke thinks they must be rather in want of\r\nprovisions. The French are all in a state of sentiment, as Bourmont's\r\nsecond son has been dangerously wounded. Certainly the way in which it is\r\nmentioned in the dispatch is good, and indeed Bourmont, a very clever man,\r\nand first under fire with his four sons, will soon be popular with an army.\r\n\r\nPolignac seems to be insensible rather than bold. He thinks all will go on\r\nwell still.\r\n\r\nThe present intention is that we should all be in gala at the funeral, with\r\nblack scarfs, &c.\r\n\r\nI have asked several to dine at Roehampton and go from thence.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is to be present, I suppose, in the King's pew. The King is\r\ncertainly to be chief mourner.\r\n\r\nWe had a great deal of talk after dinner about elections. I fear they have\r\nnot been attended to in time. It is hoped Seaford will be conquered from\r\nLord Seaford, and that the two Grants will be thrown out. We have nobody\r\nfor Surrey and nobody for Middlesex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 8._\r\n\r\nHouse. Answered the Duke of Richmond on the sale of Beer Bill. The Duke\r\nseemed very well satisfied, and the House was very attentive and cheered\r\nfrequently. We had on a division 60 to 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 9._\r\n\r\nLord Radnor made some observations upon the continuing of the Irish Arms\r\nBill without explaining the reason, the Bill having been introduced in\r\ntroublesome times and expiring at the end of this Session. Lord Grey\r\nsupported him. It is clear Lord Durham and Lord Radnor evidently intend to\r\nmake us look about us and not do work in a slovenly manner. I cannot find\r\nfault with them.\r\n\r\nLord Durham moved the printing of the Appropriation List, which was\r\nnegatived without a division, as unusual; but I dare say he will ask\r\nquestions as to some of the items.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 10._\r\n\r\nAs I was coming home from the office I called on Hardinge. He considers the\r\ndivision to have been invaluable to us here and even to France. Certainly\r\nthe French funds rose when it was known the present King held the same\r\ncourse as his predecessor. Hardinge thinks many men are disposed to support\r\nthe Duke's Government under the idea that all sorts of calamities would\r\nattend the weak Government which must succeed it. He thinks Palmerston the\r\nbest man to have in Goulburn's place, Goulburn going to the Speakership. He\r\nthinks W. Horton would be better than Frankland Lewis as his successor at\r\nthe War Office, it being necessary in either case to get Lord F. Leveson\r\ninto the House of Lords. Fitzgerald has written to Hardinge, and seems\r\neager about politics. I wish he was well and could come into office again.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the Duke or anybody would have any objection to\r\nPalmerston coming in by himself; but I doubt Huskisson's ever being in\r\noffice again while the Duke lives. Neither will the Grants come in--indeed\r\nit is to be hoped they will both be turned out of their seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 12._\r\n\r\nOffice. Backhouse brought the account of Sir J. Macdonald's expected death;\r\nthe date, May 12. Sir Henry Willock will take charge of the mission _ad\r\ninterim_. He may be a sensible man, but the loss of Macdonald is severe. I\r\ndo not know how we shall replace him.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 2. The business was the eternal slave question--what answer\r\nshould be given to Brougham to-morrow. He is expected to propose some\r\npledge of proceeding _legislatively_ in the next session as to the\r\nadmission of slave evidence and other points. A Bill has been prepared\r\nmaking slave evidence admissible, and it would probably have been\r\nintroduced but for the early termination of the session. However, there\r\nseems to be great reluctance to embark in a contest with the Colonial\r\nlegislatures. The foolish resolutions moved by Canning are deeply\r\nregretted. I was the only man who objected to them, when, two years after\r\nthey had been found of no avail, it was proposed that the Lords should\r\nconcur in them. Peel objects to any pledge on the part of Parliament, more\r\nparticularly on the eve of a dissolution. It is thought that _by paying\r\nfrom our funds_ for an improved judicature in the West Indies we may induce\r\nthe colonies to acquiesce in the admission of slave evidence, although\r\nimposed by the interposition of Parliament. I doubt it, and if we pass a\r\nlaw to which the colonies are adverse, which they will regard as being _no\r\nlaw_, how are we to execute it? We may make judges and pay them, but we\r\nmust procure submission to those judges, and further, we must make\r\n_jurymen_.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties I foresaw when the Lords adopted the Commons'\r\nresolution; but I suppose Canning forced it upon Lord Bathurst and the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nHouse at 5. Debate on the Scotch Judicature Bill. Lord Wynford made a\r\nmiserable speech, which proved he knew nothing about the subject. The\r\nChancellor was very angry with him, and once interrupted him improperly.\r\nThe debate was dull, and there was no division.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 13._\r\n\r\nWent to St. James's at half-past one. A few Privy Councillors were there to\r\nbe sworn in, amongst the rest the Duke of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington had to talk over the King about giving a lodge in\r\nBushey Park to one of the FitzClarences for his life, and about gazetting\r\nthe Queen's household. He found the King very reasonable indeed.\r\n\r\nThe King means to give his Ministers a grand dinner. He intends asking the\r\nSpeaker and the two Gold Sticks, but _not_ the _third_, the Duke of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham is Lord Steward. A bad appointment. The office of\r\nLord Chamberlain was offered by the Duke of Wellington to the Duke of\r\nBedford, Lord Rosslyn going to make the offer. The Duke of Bedford was much\r\ngratified, but declined on the ground of his health. The office was then\r\noffered to Lord Jersey, who accepted willingly.\r\n\r\nHouse. The Chancellor made an excellent speech on the Welsh Judicature\r\nBill, and it was read a second time without a further word. The Forgery\r\nBill passed with a motion of Lord Holland's _pro formâ_ that he might\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nWe had Sir Jonah Barrington for a short time. He is very roguish and sly.\r\n\r\nThere are no particulars yet of the capture of Algiers, except that the\r\nfleet co-operated.\r\n\r\nThe French seem to have been highly delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 15._\r\n\r\nSir G. Murray, Goulburn, and Herries came down to Roehampton at four to\r\ndinner. At five we set off for Windsor. The day was beautiful, and all the\r\nworld made it a holiday. Carriages of all sorts and hackney coaches were on\r\nthe road all the morning to Richmond. I never saw so many persons there,\r\nand chiefly of the class of shopkeepers. London was quite empty, but the\r\nPark quite covered with the people. It seemed to be a day of general\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nArrived at Windsor at a quarter after seven. There were a few Lancers along\r\nthe road from Frogmore, where the King and Queen were, but no crowd. Near\r\nthe town there were a great many waggons. We turned to the right at the end\r\nof the Long Walk and drove through the park to the great gate of the\r\nCastle. Within the court were Horse and Foot Guards. We entered at the\r\nvisitors' entrance, and went to St. George's Hall, where we all assembled.\r\nA great many were already come. They began forming the procession at half-\r\npast seven, and it was all formed so as to move before nine. I walked with\r\nLord Hill. There were ten or twelve barons, a number of judges, six or\r\neight bishops, and upon the whole a fair representation of the peerage and\r\nthe Privy Council. There was a double line of Life Guardsmen within the\r\ncastle, without Foot Guards, and the Blues in the chapel. We did not see\r\nthe body as we passed. A screen of black concealed the room in which it lay\r\nin state. I imagine the King was in the room. As we returned it was open.\r\n\r\nIt struck nine as we came to the Round Tower. A rocket was fired as soon as\r\nthe body moved, to give notice to Linden for the firing of the minute guns.\r\nThe bands of the several regiments played the Dead March in Saul, &c., as\r\nthe procession passed. The Foot Guards stood close together with arms\r\nreversed, every fifth man having a flambeau. The platform was, in most\r\nplaces, open on both sides. There was a good deal of air, but the night was\r\nwarm. Had there been rain, or had it been cold, some must have died. There\r\nwere but few people on the right of the platform in the inner court, but in\r\nthe outer court there was a dense mass of people, and all the roofs were\r\ncovered. There was hardly a whisper. All the people seemed very decent in\r\ntheir dress, and their conduct was perfect. The procession entered at the\r\ngreat door of the chapel and turned to the left, went down to the end of\r\nthe aisle and then turned, facing the door of the inner chapel. In the\r\nspace we thus went round were the Eton boys. In the chapel there were some\r\npersons on the right of the altar. I could not well see who they were, as\r\nthere was a sort of haze, but they were all in uniform. With this exception\r\nthe chapel was empty. We were all placed as we entered in the seats and\r\nstalls. The body was drawn upon a carriage. It was too heavy to be carried.\r\nThe King had a vast number of attendants, such as equerries, &c. Half of\r\nthem captains in the navy. The attendants pressed rather too close upon\r\nhim. He was in black with the collars of all the orders. He nodded\r\noccasionally as he recognised people; but when his countenance was still he\r\nlooked very grave. He is become very like his father. The assistant\r\nmourners, who were Lords Goderich, Sidmouth, Granville, Grantham, Carlisle,\r\nand some others, had no seats and stood during the service. The last who\r\nentered were the Guard, the colours preceding. These came half way into the\r\naisle, the colours depressed. The colonels of the battalions and the\r\ngeneral, Sir H. Vivian, came in with their caps on and swords drawn, and\r\nstood to the right and left of the King, but not near him. The banners were\r\ndepressed on the two sides of the grave. Over the grave was a black canopy,\r\non the top of which was an enormous crown. The music was good. The service\r\nwas very ill-read by the Dean Hobart, and the Garter could not make himself\r\nheard when he recited the King's titles. Lord Jersey walked as Lord\r\nChamberlain, Lord Conyngham as Steward. He broke his staff into the grave.\r\nLord Cholmondeley was there as Lord Great Chamberlain, and sat on the left\r\nof the aisle in a stall opposite the passage. On the other side was the\r\nEarl Marshal. When all was over the King went out by the small door on the\r\nleft near the King's closet, and so by the cloister to the platform. As\r\nsoon as he appeared the Guard received him with presented arms and God Save\r\nthe King. We all returned by the way we came. There was tea in St. George's\r\nHall but we went on, and finding Goulburn's servant, followed him to the\r\ncarriage, which was on the other side of the entrance gate, and so got away\r\neven before the King. We were at Roehampton by half-past one. The whole\r\nprocession lasted about two hours and a half or rather less--that is, from\r\nthe first move to the end.\r\n\r\nIt was very well arranged. Pohlman, our Deputy Black Rod, who is a Herald,\r\nwas the acting person, and did his duty admirably. There was no\r\ninterruption, no confusion, but everything managed as if we had been\r\ndrilled and did the same thing every day. And so King George IV. is gone to\r\nhis grave with all the pomp of royalty, and splendid the pageant was; but\r\nit was considered a mere pageant even by his household, who had lived so\r\nintimately with him for years. There was no regret. A coronation could\r\nhardly be gayer; but the procession was gravely done and decently.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of the castle aided the spectacle and made royalty appear\r\nalmost as imposing in death as at the moment when the Crown was assumed in\r\nthe Abbey.\r\n\r\nWe had supper and they all went to London.\r\n\r\nHuskisson and Palmerston were there. Huskisson very sulky and sour.\r\nPalmerston very cordial, as if he thought he might come in, I should be\r\nglad if he did.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Duke of Buckingham hints that he must have something more than\r\nthe stewardship for his seven votes. No one likes his appointment, and we\r\nall feel as if an alliance with the Grenville party would bring us ill-\r\nluck.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 16._\r\n\r\nHouse. Administration of Justice Bill. A great many amendments made by Lord\r\nTenterden. We struck out a clause by which Le Blanc would have been obliged\r\nto sit to tax costs every day in the year. Lord Eldon said the Bill as it\r\nwas originally drawn was more like a string of resolutions at the London\r\nTavern than an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General was very angry indeed at the alterations made in the\r\nBill, and threatened to throw it over in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nNothing said about the Libel law; but Lord Holland is to say something on\r\nthe third reading. Sir Jonah's case. W. Goady spoke. He spoke so slow, it\r\nwas like a banker paying in sixpences to gain time. He was so dull I went\r\naway for fear of falling asleep. The Duke stayed and slept.\r\n\r\nThe Duke remained at Windsor all night. I met him as he was coming down to\r\nthe office to-day. He said he had remained to see the King and give up to\r\nhim the late King's snuff-boxes, &c., which were all in a great box.\r\n\r\nLord Wharncliffe told me he thought Duncombe, Bethel, Lord Morpeth, and\r\nRamsden would come in for Yorkshire. Afterwards we heard Brougham was to\r\nstand. It will have a very bad effect if Hume and Brougham come in for\r\ngreat counties. Yet I dare say they will.\r\n\r\nWortley goes down to stand for some Scotch boroughs, which will lead to the\r\nCounty of Forfar.\r\n\r\nLong Wellesley has been arrested by Gosling the Banker for 4,000£, on which\r\nit was found that he had but 3,000£ in the books in the Bank, so he\r\nremained in durance for the other 1,000£ till he found five people, each\r\nwilling to be bound for 200£. This disposes of him for Essex. He had given\r\nout that he had 30,000£. An express has been sent off to a Mr. Lloyd, the\r\nson-in-law of the old Eliab Harvey, to stand for Essex. I know the man. He\r\nwas at Ryde in 1813, and at Cowes in 1826. His daughters are rather pretty\r\ngirls. I suggested Tower, who would have done very well for Essex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 17._\r\n\r\nSt. James's at 2. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen first came up with their\r\naddress, then the same with the Common Council. The King received the\r\naddresses, which were very loyal, on the throne. He read the answers very\r\nwell. The Ministers stood on his left and the household on his right. About\r\nseven gentlemen pensioners were on each side from the door to the foot of\r\nthe throne. The Lord Mayor, &c., were introduced by the Lord Chamberlain.\r\nIt was well done, and is rather an imposing ceremony.\r\n\r\nCabinet. First a question as to what should be done about Ashe, the man who\r\nwrote a libel on the Duke of Cumberland, which he sent to him and now\r\nreclaims. He has written many letters indicative of an intention to\r\nassassinate, and is now come up from Carlisle on foot, and has been walking\r\nopposite the Duke's house for three hours, having first written another\r\nletter of a threatening nature.\r\n\r\nLord Wynford wrote to Peel on the Duke of Cumberland's part; but the Duke\r\nwill not exhibit articles of the peace. Colonel Peter gave Ashe 5_s_. and\r\nhe went away.\r\n\r\nThe question was what could be done with him? I suggested that, as in the\r\ncase of an expected duel, a magistrate on mere information that a breach of\r\nthe peace was apprehended would take persons into custody and hold them to\r\nbail; so here the same thing might be done, one of the letters distinctly\r\nthreatening a breach of the peace. This would secure the man till it could\r\nbe discovered whether there was legal ground to indict him for the letters.\r\nThis will be done.\r\n\r\nWe then came to the consideration of the East Retford question. All the\r\npress were for giving up the Bill. I took some part in the discussion.\r\nHowever, Peel was so strongly for the Lords going as the Commons had done,\r\nand for preventing the appearance of disunion in the Cabinet, that his\r\nwishes were acceded to, and we support the Bill. The Duke _thinks_ it will\r\nbe thrown out, and I _hope_ it will. It will be very difficult to make a\r\nspeech in favour of the Bill which will not commit us to a bad precedent.\r\nHowever, I shall try. Peel was very obstinate and disagreeable. In fact the\r\ninterfering with the existing franchise never was made a Cabinet question.\r\nThe giving the franchise to Bassetlaw [Footnote: The Hundred of Bassetlaw,\r\nforming the existing borough of East Retford.] rather than to Birmingham\r\nwas, and it was because after an agreement that we should all vote for\r\nBassetlaw, Huskisson voted for Birmingham and then resigned, that the\r\nseparation took place.\r\n\r\nThese questions never were made Government questions before, and it is much\r\nbetter they should not be.\r\n\r\nPeel thinks he will not be able to oppose reform in general if we do not\r\nshow a disposition to punish individual cases of corruption.\r\n\r\nI did not get away till seven, and then went to Hardinge's to bring him\r\ndown to Wilderness. [Footnote: Seat of Lord Camden, near Sevenoaks.] He\r\ntold me the Speaker had been with the Duke and did not resign just now.\r\nThere had been a question whether he should not; but it was thought we\r\nmight be damaged at the elections if we made any change now. The Duke asked\r\nHardinge what he thought as to taking Huskisson and Palmerston back again?\r\nHardinge declared against having Huskisson, but recommended Palmerston. I\r\ndare say as soon as the elections are over something will be done, and that\r\nPalmerston will be offered the Chancellorship of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nPeel once wanted Edward Stanley, but it seems he has wavered a good deal.\r\nUnless his manner should change it would be impossible to go on with him as\r\nMinister; but I trust in God we shall never lose the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 19._\r\n\r\nReceived at nine a card from Lord Bathurst informing me that the Queen\r\nwould be in Downing Street at ten. Went in plain clothes as I was desired.\r\nFound the Queen was to be there to see the Guards, whom the King was to\r\ninspect. The Ministers were invited and the connections of the Bathursts.\r\nWe were presented to the Queen, and kissed her hand. After the parade,\r\nwhich the King attended on foot, he joined the party, and they had\r\nbreakfast. However, before that I went away. At one again at St. James's.\r\nThe two Universities came up with addresses to the King and Queen. Oxford\r\nfirst. They very properly put their doctors first. The address was read by\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor, and then, after the Queen's reply, the doctors and\r\nproctors, and a few others who formed the deputation, kissed the King's\r\nhand. As the Queen has no separate apartment the King retired, the Queen\r\nentered with her household and ladies, and then the same ceremony was gone\r\nthrough, the Ministers remaining on the left behind the ladies. The Queen\r\nread pretty well. She was obliged to rise each time to give her hand to be\r\nkissed. Cambridge came afterwards with the Duke of Gloucester and all the\r\nPeers, who belonged to the University, in their gowns at the head. This\r\ndestroyed the character of the collegiate body. However, those only were\r\npresented who were presented of the Oxford deputation. The King went beyond\r\nhis written speech to the men of Cambridge, and put us in a fright.\r\nHowever, it was good-humoured, and of no great harm--a sort of joke.\r\n\r\nI came away as I had business. Afterwards there was a Council, and the\r\nLords Lieutenant were admitted to take the oaths.\r\n\r\nHouse. East Retford. The Chancellor made a capital speech, and we had a\r\nbetter division than case, 29 to 7. Lord Durham spoke temperately and well.\r\nLord Grey well too. We had Wynford with us. There is no explaining that\r\nman. The Duke of Cumberland voted against us, and Eldon spoke.\r\n\r\nAt St. James's. Lord Westmoreland told me that yesterday at a great dinner\r\nthe King gave his household he gave as a toast, 'The land we live in, and\r\nlet those who don't like it leave it.'\r\n\r\nThis and many other things show his feelings towards the Duke of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nThe King reviews a regiment every morning this week. He has been on\r\nhorseback within these six weeks, but he has a rupture, and is now rather\r\nafraid of riding. He is going to change the uniforms of the Lords\r\nLieutenant.\r\n\r\nWe expect to prorogue on Friday and dissolve on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 20._\r\n\r\nThen East Retford. Lord Wharncliffe moved a resolution with the view of\r\ngiving the franchise to Birmingham instead of the Hundred. Dudley spoke for\r\nBirmingham and well. I spoke shortly. I guarded myself against being\r\nconsidered as pledged to any other measure, intending to decide all\r\nmeasures according to the special circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was not so cautious as I was, and spoke strongly against giving\r\nthe franchise to great towns. [Footnote: No one expected it to occur in two\r\nyears' time.] Lord Holland said to the Chancellor, 'He will live to see it\r\ndone.' I think I may, and therefore was cautious.\r\n\r\nWe had 39 to 16.\r\n\r\nSo ends the business of this Session.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 21._\r\n\r\nWent at ten to the Duke of Wellington's, where the King and Queen were to\r\nbreakfast after an inspection of the 2nd Life Guards. The day was beautiful\r\nand the people in excellent humour. The King first went with the Queen to\r\nthe Regent's Park barracks, and then to the Knightsbridge barracks. When\r\nthey came to the Duke's the King went to the window and was well cheered.\r\nThey then called for the Queen, who went to the window and was very well\r\nreceived indeed.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening the King walked out alone into St. James's Street. He\r\nfound Watson Taylor and took his arm. The mob pressed upon him so much that\r\nWatson Taylor's shoes were trodden down at heel. While the King was alone\r\nan Irish woman came out of an alley and kissed him. This and a lecture from\r\nthe Duke have cured him of walking out alone. At least he has promised not\r\nto do so again.\r\n\r\nHouse at 2. Aberdeen says the King spoke very well to the foreign Ministers\r\nto-day. There was an extraordinary number of naval officers, and the\r\nfullest _levée_ I ever saw. The King recognised very cordially all his old\r\nfriends. He was very gracious indeed to Elphinstone, whom he saw for the\r\nfirst time. He was imprudent enough to make a sort of speech to the West\r\nIndian deputation, and pledged himself warmly to support their interests.\r\nThis I saw. After I was gone I hear Astell and Campbell came up with the\r\naddress of the East India Company, and that he spoke in similar terms to\r\nthem. This the foolish Astell will publish everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Duke says he goes away when the King begins to speak. I really covered\r\nmy face when he began to speak about the Catholics to the deputation from\r\nCambridge. What he said to them, which was no more than an indifferent\r\njoke, has been variously misrepresented and not at all understood. It must\r\nhave been imperfectly heard.\r\n\r\nThe King is angry with the Duke of Gloucester for slurring over a part of\r\nthe address from Cambridge, which was very loyal, and for not kissing his\r\nhand. He has reason to complain of this. The Duke of Gloucester kissed the\r\nQueen's hand with marked devotion.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Sussex has been already infusing poison into the King's ear and\r\ntalking of invasions of the property of the Church. This the King told\r\nPeel. Those who observed the Duke of Sussex at the levee thought he seemed\r\nvery triumphant, and received his Whig friends with a smile which said, 'We\r\nshall do them yet.'\r\n\r\nHe was invested with the Thistle to-day. The King asked all the knights\r\npresented to drink a bottle of claret with him in October.\r\n\r\nBlomberg was up with an address. The King said, 'You and I know each other\r\nof old. You need not be presented. By-the-bye, you may as well dine with me\r\nto-day.'\r\n\r\nThe King made an extemporaneous reply to the address of the Canons of\r\nWindsor the day after the funeral. They begged to have a copy. He\r\nendeavoured to recollect it for them, and sent it to Peel. Peel found some\r\ncurious historical inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington thinks we shall gradually bring the King round, and\r\ninduce him to move more quietly. To thwart him directly would have a bad\r\neffect; but he may be led. In the meantime he is very well in health.\r\n\r\nThe King has promised to dine with Leopold, who has asked the Duke, but not\r\nAberdeen. The Duke thinks the King should not dine with him now. The two\r\nother Powers having manifested the greatest dissatisfaction with Leopold's\r\nconduct, and we having intimated it in the House, it would be incongruous\r\nand injurious for the King to dine with him. Leopold has written one if not\r\ntwo letters complaining of the conduct of the Allied Powers.\r\n\r\nWe went to the House for fear Lord Durham should play us a trick, and it is\r\nperhaps fortunate we did, for he was there and made a protesting speech,\r\nwhich was followed by one from Westmoreland on the East Retford Bill.\r\nHowever, we had a majority in the House, and there was no division.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 22._\r\n\r\nRode to town. Cabinet. Considered the King's Speech. Peel had introduced a\r\nplagiarism from the first speech of the old King, 'Born and educated in\r\nthis country, I glory in the name of Briton.' However, the whole sentence\r\nwould not do, and it was omitted. I assisted in working the sentences into\r\nform, and breaking them up into short ones. Went away to dress for the\r\nCouncil, thinking the whole settled. Council at three. First the deputies\r\nof the two Houses carried up the joint address respecting Sir Jonah\r\nBarrington. Then the King being alone, and saying he was ready for his\r\nMinisters--none being there but me--I went in, and first asked him to allow\r\nClare to wear the uniform the late King gave him. This led to a long talk\r\nabout uniforms for Indian Governors, and I had some little difficulty to\r\ncarry my coat without having a general consideration of the whole question\r\nof Governor's uniforms. I then told the King of the approaching death of\r\nSir J. Macdonald. He asked whom we proposed sending in his place? I told\r\nhim it did not entirely depend upon the King's Ministers, but that I\r\nthought, if we recommended a very fit man, we should get the Chairs to name\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe King said, 'You heard what I said to the East India Company yesterday?'\r\nI had not, but I bowed, and he added, 'I told them they should not be\r\nunfairly dealt with. There is a run on them, and the notions of people are\r\nvery much exaggerated with regard to the question.'\r\n\r\nI said the question would require and receive the most mature consideration\r\nfrom his Ministers before they ventured to offer any advice to his Majesty\r\nupon the course to be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe King said in about ten or twelve days he should be able to give me a\r\nday or two for Indian matters.\r\n\r\nI thought I had given time to the others to arrive, and rose. I should\r\nmention that he spoke of Algiers, and said he suspected there was an\r\nunderstanding about it between the Russians and the French.\r\n\r\nI said I did not entertain much fear of the French having Algiers. With a\r\nlittle money we could raise Morocco on one side and Tunis on the other, and\r\nharass them from the interior, and while we took care they had not Tunis,\r\nAlgiers was comparatively unimportant. With Tunis, Malta, and Corfu we\r\nshould hold our hands across the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nI went out and found them come. The Duke went in. The King gives up dining\r\nwith Leopold. He gave it up the moment the objections to it were mentioned\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThe speech was, I found, much improved after I went away. The King said he\r\nthought nothing could be better, and indeed it is a very good speech. He\r\nsaid he thought the reference to the Catholic question was unavoidable, as\r\nit was the great measure of the Parliament; and it was particularly proper\r\nthat he should refer to it as he had voted for it, really thinking that the\r\nChurch would be more secure by means of Catholic admission than by their\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nI thought the King seemed a little tired. Well he might be. He had been at\r\nan inspection of troops, the Grenadier Guards and the Lancers, from ten to\r\none, and the day was very hot. He inspected the troops on foot.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington passed the King at the head of his regiment, and\r\nLord Rosslyn at the head of his. Lord Rosslyn is delighted with the\r\nopportunities of wearing his uniform, and playing the general officer\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 24._\r\n\r\nCouncil at 11. Parliament dissolved. The seals were delivered to the\r\nSecretaries and to Goulburn. Herries kissed hands.\r\n\r\nSir G. Clark becomes Under-Secretary to the Home Department. W. Peel goes\r\nto the Treasury. Charles Ross comes into Clark's place. Macnaughten goes\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 26._\r\n\r\nDined at St. James's. The King of Wurtemburg, the Ministers, Foreign\r\nMinisters, Household, and Knights of the Garter there, in all 80. After\r\ndinner the King made a speech which made his Ministers' hearts fail within\r\nthem. However, we were _quitte pour la peur_. He only spoke of his love of\r\npeace. The only thing painful was that he should speak at all, and before\r\nhis servants, like a chairman of a public meeting.\r\n\r\nAt the Duke of Wellington's on Sunday he made a speech, praising very much\r\nthe Duke, and declaring his entire confidence in him. This was before the\r\nForeign Ministers. The speech was a little warlike, I believe. The Duke's\r\nreply very short indeed, and peaceful. The King should recollect that what\r\nhe speaks is as important as what is written in a State Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 28._\r\n\r\nLevée. Before it a Council, _standing_, in the King's closet, for swearing\r\nin Privy Councillors. Sir R. Wilson was presented on his restoration to the\r\narmy, and holding the King's hand in his expressed his gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe King made an energetic reply, and then there was a short rejoinder from\r\nSir R. Wilson. I could not hear what was said. We afterwards shook hands\r\ncordially with Sir R. Wilson, whose restoration pleases everybody.\r\n\r\nThe French Government have dissolved the Chamber without allowing it to\r\nassemble; have placed the press under restriction, and altered the mode of\r\nelecting deputies, so as, as far as I can understand, to give to _les plus\r\nimposis_ the power of electing a majority.\r\n\r\nNo letter has been received by any Foreign Minister or by us. The whole was\r\nkept a profound secret. The report to the King respecting the press, which\r\nis made the foundation of the Ordonnance, is a long violent declamation,\r\nvery weakly written indeed. [Footnote: These were the celebrated Ordinances\r\nwhich cost Charles X. his crown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 28._\r\n\r\nCabinet at half-past three. I was rather late, and found them considering\r\nwhat should be said by Lord Stuart at Paris, respecting the late violent\r\nmeasures of the French Government. They had decided that Lord Stuart, if\r\nPrince Polignac endeavoured to draw from him in conversation his opinion,\r\nshould say he was directed to offer none. They seemed inclined to tell him,\r\nif Prince Polignac required his opinion by offering an explanation, to say\r\nwe considered the measure adopted was in violation of the Charter. At my\r\nsuggestion, if Polignac asked his opinion more formally and offered no\r\nexplanation, he was directed to request the explanation might be in\r\nwriting, and he would transmit it to his Court, or it might be made through\r\nthe French Ambassador here. The French Ambassador, however, knowing nothing\r\nof what was doing, left England on Monday, and would meet the news on his\r\nroad to Paris.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock on Tuesday evening a row was going on, and a Guardsman had\r\nbeen killed. This was resistance when the police broke the types, &c., of a\r\npress which would go on. The idea is, that the Chamber of Deputies will\r\nmeet, considering the dissolution to be illegal.\r\n\r\nMatuschevitz openly inveighs against the measure. It is doubtful whether\r\nMetternich did not advise it. He sent a long paper from Johannisberg,\r\ngiving his views on the present position of the French Government.\r\n\r\nThe King of Wurtemburg had an interview of two hours with the Duke of\r\nWellington yesterday. He is very anxious on the subject of France. He says\r\nthe people of Wurtemburg will cry out that a similar measure is intended\r\nagainst them--that everywhere the two extreme parties will be placed in\r\ncollision. Bulow thinks the same. The Duke advised the King of Wurtemburg\r\nto avoid Paris on his return; but the King has some _emplettes_ to make,\r\nand goes there. The Duke advised him then, if he must go for his\r\n_emplettes_, to stay only a day. He said he would not stay above five or\r\nsix! Thus is every consideration of real importance sacrificed to motives\r\nof private fancy and convenience!\r\n\r\nLea informed Aberdeen that a vessel was fitting out in the Thames with\r\nSpanish refugees and arms to endeavour to raise an insurrection in Spain.\r\nAfter some time they found the vessel, and to-day she was detained. She had\r\nsixty-nine men, and about 150 stand of arms on board. They sank the printed\r\nproclamations which were picked up. Torrijos and Valdes were to be the\r\nleaders. Torrijos was to join below the revenue vessels. Some of the men\r\nhad 10£ each, given to them by the Spanish Committee, to aid their voyage\r\nto Rio. There is some doubt under what law they are to be indicted, and the\r\nAttorney and Solicitor-General are out of town.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Lord Heytesbury, enclosing one he had received from\r\nCaptain Campbell, announcing the death of Sir J. Macdonald.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 29._\r\n\r\nThe Duke told me he had seen Rothschild that morning, who had recent\r\nintelligence from Paris. The Guards were faithful, but the 53rd Regiment,\r\nwhich was at the Hôtel de Ville, had joined the people, and so had\r\nindividual soldiers of other regiments. The people and the National Guards\r\nwere arming. The Chambers had assembled. The King was not at Paris. He was\r\nnought to be at Compiègne.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thought Henry had better not go to Paris, that one party or the\r\nother would soon attack the English.\r\n\r\nCalled on Elphinstone. Offered him Persia. He was much obliged, but said\r\nnothing would induce him ever to go to Asia again.\r\n\r\nSpoke to him of Monteith. He knows him, and a little doubted his\r\ndiscretion. He promised to find him, and send him to the Duke if he was in\r\ntown; but he thought he was at Algiers. Spoke to him of Jenkins and Briggs.\r\nHe says Jenkins is the abler man.\r\n\r\nSaw Lord Essex and Lord Clinton. They had heard the Duke of Orleans was\r\nproclaimed Regent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 31._\r\n\r\nWent to town early. Called at the Duke's to hear the news. None had arrived\r\nsince yesterday morning. The Duke said he considered the King dethroned,\r\nand we should soon have to consider whether we should acknowledge the new\r\nGovernment. I observed that our course must depend very much upon the\r\nmanner in which the French effected their Revolution. The King had put\r\nhimself decidedly in the wrong, and if they make their Revolution as we\r\nmade ours in 1688, there was no reason why we should not acknowledge the\r\nnew Government, be it what it might. The Duke said the foreigners were\r\nalready coming to know what we thought and meant to do. We should have them\r\nall in our train, and provided we took a reasonable course on the question\r\nof Algiers, and others which might arise, we should do very well. The\r\nmischief was that this event would place the two parties in presence on\r\nevery occasion, and every trifling difference would resolve itself into one\r\nof Liberal and anti-Liberal. I said I feared whatever party predominated,\r\neven if the King regained his power, France would be precipitated into a\r\nwar, for no party would be able to maintain itself in quiet times. The Duke\r\nsaid the King's Government was becoming very dangerous. It had, as was\r\nshown in the case of Algiers, and their discussions with us, no more\r\nmorality than that of Buonaparte, and it had the favour of European Powers\r\nas an ancient dynasty, while it was prepared to act upon the principles of\r\na new one. Now, under a Government of Revolutionary origin, all their Acts\r\nwould be viewed with disfavour and suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe Duke spoke very strongly against Canning's policy, in admitting France\r\nto the Triple Alliance [Footnote: By the Treaty of London with reference to\r\nGreece.] and thus bringing her into a prominent station in Europe again.\r\nShe would naturally have risen again in good time. The time should not have\r\nbeen anticipated by us.\r\n\r\nThe Duke agreed with me in thinking the Government here would be\r\nstrengthened by what was occurring in France.\r\n\r\nI lamented Brougham's success in Yorkshire, and viewed with some\r\napprehension the increased power it would give him. He said Yorkshire was\r\nquite radicalised by having four members. No gentleman could bear the\r\nexpense--the middle classes had it all to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to four I called at the Treasury and found Rothschild had\r\nreceived intelligence down to the 29th, at 4 P.M. Drummond showed me the\r\nDuke's letter to Peel which contained this account:--That there was\r\nfighting all Wednesday, the 28th, and Thursday, till 3 P.M. There had been\r\na terrible massacre, but the troops got the worst of it. The people were\r\nled by the students of the Ecole de Droit, and of the Ecole Polytechnique.\r\nThe 53rd Regiment, which it was said yesterday had joined the people, had\r\nin fact surrendered. The people had armed themselves at the Arsenal. On the\r\nnight of the 28th the Guards retook the Hôtel de Ville, but were driven out\r\nagain, and retired to the Louvre. The firing did not cease at the Tuileries\r\ntill past 3 P.M. The people pillaged it when the troops retreated, and the\r\ntri-coloured flag was hoisted there, and on the column in the Place\r\nVendôme. The Ministers escaped by subterraneous passages from the\r\nTuileries, and were with the King, who had a great many troops about him at\r\nSt. Cloud. La Fayette commanded the National Guard, and was a member of the\r\nProvisional Government. Generals Gerard, Lafitte, and Casimir Perrier were\r\nthe others. C. Perrier was deputed to the King at St. Cloud.\r\n\r\nNo couriers were allowed to leave Paris. These letters were sent by private\r\nservants to the first stage.\r\n\r\nI told all this to Henry, but he goes. So do many others. There were thirty\r\npeople applying for passports when he went for his. On the other hand many\r\nEnglish come away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 2._\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of information in the 'Times.' The result is, that\r\nthe King's offer to change his Ministers and to recall the Ordonnances was\r\nnot accepted, and the Duke of Orleans accepted the office of Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral of the kingdom. His address is quite in the spirit of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe Guards are disorganised and desert.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss only are said to remain with the King, who it is thought is gone\r\nto Nantes.\r\n\r\nLord Stuart says if the Royalists do not resist, the French will invade\r\nBelgium in three months. The Deputies, at first in very small numbers, not\r\nmore than thirty, nor at any time much above sixty, seem to have been\r\nirresolute. They were decided by others, and indeed the whole seems to have\r\nbeen done by the people. There is no appearance of previous concert. If\r\nthere were leaders, they were the boys of the Ecole de Droit and the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique. Polignac seems to have been firm after the beginning of the\r\nfight, and when Lafitte and others went to Marmont at the Tuileries, in the\r\nmiddle of the tumult, he declared concession impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Guards at St. Cloud told the King they would protect him, but would not\r\nadvance again to Paris. General [blank] seems to have had 6,000 men at\r\nVersailles, but the people would not admit him. At Rouen there was great\r\nferment, and forty pieces of cannon were sent by the people to the\r\nassistance of Paris. The troops seem to have been ordered upon Paris from\r\nall quarters. The total loss of life is estimated at 5,000.\r\n\r\nThe people were becoming impatient, and cried _Vive la République! Vive\r\nNapoleon II._! This, it is said, determined the Duke of Orleans to accept:\r\nand the Deputies offered, because they feared the establishment of a\r\nRepublic would be the signal of general war.\r\n\r\nI do not hear of the pillage of private houses. The churches have been\r\npillaged and the palaces ransacked. The priests thought fit to fire from\r\nthe Archbishop's palace, which led to the death of many and to the pillage\r\nof the palace.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said they had done everything in the most offensive way, re-\r\nestablishing the tri-coloured flag, &c. They seem determined to force the\r\nRevolution down the throat of Europe. He spoke of the Duke of Orleans'\r\naddress. I said I supposed he was obliged for his own safety to throw\r\nhimself at once into the Revolution. The more natural thing would have been\r\nfor the French to have sent for young Napoleon. The Duke said he heard\r\nyoung Napoleon was getting hold of French pamphlets, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans asked Lord Stuart's advice as to accepting the Crown.\r\nLord Stuart reminded him of his oath, and told him the Powers of Europe\r\nwhich restored the Bourbons could never recognise him.\r\n\r\nOn consideration I think we should endeavour to induce the Powers which\r\nsigned the Treaty of Vienna to declare that they are determined to maintain\r\nthe territorial arrangements made by that treaty; but that they will not\r\ninterfere with the internal Government of France.\r\n\r\nI think this declaration, made at once, would perhaps prevent any attempt\r\non the part of the French to make war for the frontier of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe elections go well for us, except Canterbury, where Lord Fordwich has\r\nbeat our man, Henry B. Baring, the husband of Lady Augusta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 3._\r\n\r\nThe accounts from Paris state that the Due de Mortemar, who had been\r\nappointed Minister by Charles X. himself, saw it was too late, and that the\r\nonly chance for the House of Bourbon was in the placing the Duke of Orleans\r\nin the office of Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\nThis he proposed himself to the Duke of Orleans, who wrote to the King, and\r\nin accepting the office said his conduct would show with what views he did\r\nit. Then he issued a tri-colour proclamation! Lord Stuart says this was\r\ndone at the last possible moment. The proclamation was received with cries\r\nof _Vive la Republique! Vive Napoleon II._! However, these cries ceased,\r\nand it was hoped things would go on quietly. Sebastiani and B. Constant\r\nexpressed hopes that in a few months men's minds would be tranquillised,\r\nand things placed on a regular footing It seems that the King is at\r\nTrianon, with about 4,000 guards. He talked of resigning to the Dauphin, if\r\nhe had not already done so. It will probably be too late, and the Dauphin\r\nis supposed, I believe very justly, to be implicated in all that has\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nLord Stuart states the loss of the troops at 3,000. That of the people at\r\n6,000. Of course these calculations are very vague, and probably\r\nexaggerated. It would appear as if there had been more preparation on the\r\npart of the insurgents than was imagined. The decisive measure, that of the\r\nBank refusing discounts, was of course suggested by Lafitte. The Royalists\r\nare much in want of money. They left forty-two millions in their caisses,\r\nand 150 millions at the Bank! Bourmont was to leave Algiers on the 25th.\r\nProbably he was called home to be present at the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe King's troops still remaining in force at St. Cloud, the barricades are\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nEverybody seems to think the military force was as ill-managed as\r\neverything else. Marmont acted _mollement_.\r\n\r\nWe have been beaten at Canterbury, and what is worse at Norwich, where a\r\nbrother of Peel's has been driven out by Robert Grant, the most decided\r\nenemy of the Government. No one declares himself the opponent of\r\nGovernment, and as such asks support; but our candidates do not succeed at\r\npopular elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 4._\r\n\r\nTo London early. The King of France is supposed to be gone towards\r\nCherbourg. We fear he will come here. The Duke said the King seemed\r\ndisposed to receive him, and reminded the King that the Pretender had been\r\nthree times ordered out of Paris on the representations of this country. I\r\nwas glad to find a very general feeling that the King of France could not\r\nbe permitted to remain if intrigues were allowed by him. That he could have\r\nno more than a refuge. Peel seemed to feel this most strongly. The Duke\r\nseemed to think there had been previous concert on the part of the\r\n_patriots_.\r\n\r\nThe King is violent against the Duke of Orleans.\r\n\r\nOur Duke of Orleans, as I call him, the Duke of Sussex, sticks close to the\r\nKing whenever he appears.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland has resigned the Blues in a huff because they are\r\nplaced under the Commander-in-Chief. However, he wore the uniform to-day at\r\nthe levée.\r\n\r\nWe have a Cabinet to-morrow at 4, on Civil List and Regency. Indeed we know\r\nnot how soon we may meet Parliament. Perhaps on September 15.\r\n\r\nThe Queen received the address of the London clergy. She had her whole\r\n_état major_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 5._\r\n\r\nAt four Cabinet. Talk about the Civil List. There are pensions to the\r\namount of about 7,000£ a year which the present King will pay, and he will\r\npay 6,000£ a year to Mrs. Fitzherbert, her charge on Brighton. She had\r\n10,000£ a year before. Many pensions are struck off, one of 500£ to Sir J.\r\nLake, many others, to jockies, &c.\r\n\r\nIt seems the late King borrowed 50,000£ for himself and as much for the\r\nDuke of York, on the revenues of Hanover, which sums have been paid off.\r\n\r\nThe King of France abdicated, and so did the Dauphin, in favour of the Duc\r\nde Bordeaux, in a letter addressed by them to the Duke of Orleans, in which\r\nhis Lieut.-Generalship was treated as emanating from the King. The Duke of\r\nOrleans in his speech to the Chambers announced the abdications, but did\r\nnot say they were in favour of Henry V. Hence the people of Paris, hearing\r\nthe King made difficulties, supposed he had receded from his original\r\npromise--whereas he only said his original promise was conditional, _and\r\nhad not_ been fairly made known. Be this as it may, 35,000 men set off for\r\nRambouillet to take him, 10,000 were sent afterwards by the Duke of Orleans\r\nto protect him, and he has 7,000 at Rambouillet, chiefly cavalry and\r\nartillery, for the same purpose. I think there must be a smash.\r\n\r\nStuart and Pozzo went to the Duke of Orleans to represent the personal\r\ndanger of the King, and to desire that measures might be taken to preserve\r\nhis life. The Duke is represented as having been _très ému_, and as having\r\nsaid that his character depended upon the preservation of the King's life,\r\nand the measures I mentioned were immediately taken.\r\n\r\nChateaubriand and Hyde de Neuville are for the Due de Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nStuart has, I know not why, counselled the Duc de Bordeaux's friends to be\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington thinks there is Radicalism in everything-that the\r\nLieut.-General will have no power.\r\n\r\nThe King went in grand state through the City to the Tower. He had six\r\ncarriages and six. At the Tower the Duke gave him a breakfast. He then went\r\non to Greenwich by water, and returned to London by land. He was very well\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 6._\r\n\r\nAt the dinner we had the Ministers, Household, and Trinity House. Chairman\r\nand deputy-Chairman of the East India Company, Governor and deputy-Governor\r\nof the Bank, Lord Mayor, and Ward and Thompson, members for the City. The\r\nKing made speeches and gave toasts as if he was Duke of Clarence at the\r\nTrinity House. He alarmed and pained us, but he did less mischief than I\r\nshould have expected; and as all the people present were real friends, he\r\nonly let down the dignity of the Crown.\r\n\r\nHe gave the healths of the Ministers, and afterwards of the Duke of\r\nWellington. Some things he said very well. The Duke answered very well.\r\n\r\nThere is so much good feeling about the King that his errors of taste are\r\npardoned. He will improve, and wear his robes more gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 7._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Determined that the principle of the Regency Bill should be that\r\nthe mother of the Sovereign should be Regent. The Regent to have unlimited\r\npower. If any limitation, it should only be placed upon the creation of\r\nPeers, and a Council of Regency should exist only for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWe separated till the 23rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 9._\r\n\r\nIn coming down to Sandgate read James's and Cabell's memoranda on the\r\nprogress of the British Government in India, and our foreign relations.\r\n\r\nAs I was coming out of Maidstone met the candidates coming in. Sir E.\r\nKnatchbull in a cocked hat, attended by thirty or forty gentlemen in black,\r\nall covered with dust, preceded by about six blue flags, and followed by\r\nsome carriages with ugly women. Then came T. Law Hodges (why _Law_ I do not\r\nknow), with many light blue flags, and some low people--few gentlemen. The\r\nnumbers, however, of the Hodges colours and people were greater than that\r\nof the Knatchbull squad. Not a cheer for either. The whole thing flat and\r\nridiculous--worthy of Hogarth. There were some people collected in\r\nMaidstone, but not so many as on a market day--there were none on the\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nBy the 'Times' I see the Chamber has modified the Charter, and has\r\nproclaimed the Duke of Orleans King of the French; at least has offered him\r\nthe Crown on the condition of his acceptance of the modified Charter.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Peers is put by. It is only advised to _eliminate_ the last\r\nseventy-six peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 10._\r\n\r\nBriscoe comes in for Surrey, to the exclusion of Jolliffe, our friend.\r\nCertainly the popular elections have all been unfavourable to us. In fact\r\nthe Tories have not yet recovered their good-humour, and the Government has\r\nsome furious enemies, and no warm friends. I do not think we can go on\r\nwithout an accession of speaking strength. Our measures must be modified to\r\nmeet the circumstances of the times, and so far I have no fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 13._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Read Lord Stuart's despatches. There is little in them that\r\nis not in the newspapers. He says the Revolution has been brought about by\r\nsmall proprietors acting under the influence of bankers and lawyers. The\r\ntroops have shown no great popular feeling. Many have taken the opportunity\r\nof going home.\r\n\r\nThe new King's oath-taking was flatly received. As long as he can keep La\r\nFayette with him he is master of Paris.\r\n\r\nLord Stuart seems to have behaved prudently in merely acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of the communication from Marshal Jourdan of his being appointed\r\nforeign secretary. The Neapolitan Ambassador wished to have a note\r\ngenerally agreed upon. All the Ambassadors say they are so sure England\r\nwill judge rightly, that they will, without instructions, follow in our\r\nwake.\r\n\r\nLa Fayette has originated the idea of a mission of deputies of the National\r\nGuard to London to thank the English people for their sympathy. Lord Stuart\r\nhopes the King will induce La Fayette to give up this mischievous and\r\nfoolish scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 18._\r\n\r\nLord J. Russell is not returned for Bedford. He lost it by one vote. He has\r\npublished a good address, and is evidently very indignant.\r\n\r\nBrougham has had questions put to him by Martin Bree, which he has answered\r\nsatisfactorily to the venereal doctor. It would have been good fun had they\r\nfought.\r\n\r\nThe only merit of the French Revolution seems to be that it has not been\r\nvindictive. If they are wise they will not touch the lives of the\r\nMinisters. The new King calls his eldest son Duke of Orleans. All the\r\ndaughters are to be Princesses of Orleans, distinguished by their Christian\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThis is like Henry IV.'s policy in reserving the Duchy of Lancaster. He\r\nwishes to be able to make room for Henry V. He has given up his property to\r\nhis eldest son's little children, and would probably, if he were displaced,\r\nemigrate quietly, as he has often done before, and leave his children in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nWhen Brougham accused the Duke of Wellington of advising Polignac, the\r\nwhole meeting of his own friends expressed dissent. It is incredible that\r\nhe should be so foolish as to believe such a thing, or as to attempt to\r\nmake others believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 19._\r\n\r\nI see by the 'Sun' that the ex-King of France is arrived at Portsmouth. I\r\nam very sorry for it, although he will not be received by the King, and\r\nwill probably sail immediately. He may require refitting, for I dare say he\r\nbrought off little from Rambouillet. His packets are accompanied by two\r\nFrench vessels of war, and all the French vessels at Spithead hoisted the\r\ntri-coloured flag when he was known to be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 20._\r\n\r\nIt seems the Royal party have landed at Cowes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 23._\r\n\r\nWent to the Cabinet room to read despatches. Lord Stuart represents the\r\nGovernment as by no means settled; anxious to remain at peace, and to\r\nprevent revolution, but not secure. Things which are essential the new King\r\nis obliged to ask humbly of La Fayette, who is now really Sovereign.\r\n\r\nLa Fayette wanted to dissolve the Chamber. The King rightly thought that to\r\ndo so now would be to make a Convention. [Footnote: I.e. as in 1792.]\r\n\r\nSome persons are gone off to bring Napoleon II., but the Austrians will\r\nstop them on the way.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians on the first intelligence of the events at Paris sent orders\r\nto their Minister to come away, but he was directed not to do so without\r\nconcert with his colleagues. They met, and agreed to recommend him to stay.\r\nThe disposition of Metternich and Nesselrode, who met at Toplitz or\r\nCarlsbad, I forget which, was the same and reasonable--to leave France to\r\nsettle her own affairs quietly, and only to interfere if she invaded the\r\npeace of other States.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has left a memorandum on the Cabinet table showing clearly from\r\ntreaties that this is not a case in which we are bound to interfere. We\r\nengaged to support a constitutional monarch against revolutionary\r\nmovements, but the monarch having violated the constitution has broken the\r\ncondition. France may still form a part of the Congress of Europe, in\r\n'Union or _Pacific Concert_,' with the four great Powers. The treaty of\r\noffensive alliance between those Powers is dormant, while France remains\r\nunder a constitutional King.\r\n\r\nThe Duke properly thinks that the sooner, after having taken a decent time\r\nfor deliberation, we can recognise the Duke of Orleans, the better for him\r\nand for us.\r\n\r\nHe expects at no distant period war, as the consequence of these events,\r\nand I fear he may be right. It will arise by the imitation of the Spaniards\r\nand Portuguese, and the ambitious sympathy of the French.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Russia means to indulge France with Algiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 23._\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from the Duke respecting Rajpootana. He thinks the\r\ncession of territory will only lead to new demands on our part, and advises\r\nthat, unless it should be necessary to give some instruction, the letter\r\nshould not be sent. He thinks, too, that as no brevet has been given to\r\nKing's officers in Ava, none can be given to those of the Company. I am to\r\nsee him tomorrow upon these points.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. Showed Herries the answer I proposed sending, respecting the\r\nInterest Bills, of which he entirely approved.\r\n\r\nPeel was not at the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nRead the Duke of Orleans' letter to the King, which is proper. He says he\r\nlaments and wishes he could have prevented the fall of the eldest branch of\r\nhis family. He _devoted_ himself to prevent misfortunes which would have\r\nendangered the peace of Europe. He avows pacific intentions.\r\n\r\nThe King is to receive General Baudrand, who brought the letter in the\r\nLevee, which will be before the Council on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThe King of the French will be acknowledged. A letter will be written to\r\nour Ministers with the great powers stating our reasons for doing so. This\r\nwill be read to the Foreign Ministers here.\r\n\r\nI suggested that it might be as well to make the letter substantially the\r\nDuke's Memorandum, and particularly to remind France that the Quadruple\r\nAlliance still existed. We shall have the drafts of the letter tomorrow.\r\n\r\nParliament to be prorogued to October 26.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow the Brazilians will acknowledge Miguel as the Regent, if he will\r\nmarry Maria da Gloria. Then came some absurd conditions. However, the thing\r\nis to be considered to-morrow. Aberdeen's idea is that there is no doing\r\nanything with Don Pedro, and that we must acknowledge Don Miguel as soon as\r\nhe will grant an amnesty.\r\n\r\nWe were to have a Council on Wednesday for the prorogation. The King will\r\nnot much like this, as he wanted to go to Ascot, but he may have it as\r\nearly as he likes, and he ought to receive General Baudrand soon. We may\r\nhave the Council at 10, and he may be at Ascot in excellent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 24._\r\n\r\nThe Council is at 1. At 1 I went to the Duke. Told him of my recent letters\r\nto the Chairs. He said we must not make bankrupts of the Company, if we\r\nwould use them hereafter. I said it was my duty to state the case of the\r\npublic, as the Board were guardians of the territorial revenue.\r\n\r\nA letter from Count Moltke, requesting to see me. I have appointed to-\r\nmorrow at 3.\r\n\r\nCabinet at 3. Aberdeen read the proposed letter from the King to King Louis\r\nPhilippe. With a few trifling alterations it was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Duke called on Marmont to-day, and received from him a military account\r\nof the affair at Paris. Marmont said he knew nothing of the Ordonnances,\r\nand disapproved of them. He was at the King's levée on the Tuesday, and was\r\ntold there were _quelques inquiétudes_ at Paris, and to take the command of\r\nthe troops. He found only 7,000 men. Polignac, forgetting any were _en\r\ncongé_, thought there were 12,000. He occupied the Places de l'Hôtel de\r\nVille, de la Bastille, de Victoire, and de Vendôme in sufficient force. His\r\ntroops were not attacked. He withdrew them at night, and reoccupied the\r\nPosts in the morning. Then the attack began. The troops maintained\r\nthemselves, but he found it necessary to withdraw them to the Louvre, the\r\nTuileries, the Pont Neuf, and the Place de Vendôme. In the Louvre he had\r\ntwo battalions of Swiss; two battalions of the Line in the Place de\r\nVendôme; the Guards in the Tuileries. He kept open his communication with\r\nthe country by posts at all the avenues leading to the garden of the\r\nTuileries and the Bois de Boulogne, Champs Elysées, &c. The battalion at\r\nthe Place de la Bastille could not retreat by the straight road, and was\r\nobliged to march all round Paris, crossing the river at the bridge nearest\r\nCharenton, and coming to the Tuileries by the Faubourg.\r\n\r\nThe two battalions in the Place de Vendôme went over to the people. He then\r\nsent one battalion from the Louvre to the grille of the Tuileries garden,\r\nopposite the Rue de Rivoli, and so protected his flank. On Thursday he had\r\nlost 1,800 men, killed and wounded; and 1,200 _égarés_--besides the two\r\nbattalions; but he had received a reinforcement of 3,000 men. The troops\r\nwere _extenués de fatigue_. When Lafitte and the others came to him he told\r\nhim he could not order the fire to cease. He was attacked.\r\n\r\nIf the fire of the people ceased, his troops would not fire. He fairly told\r\nthe King it was not _une commotion_, nor even _une insurrection_, but _une\r\nRévolution_. There were not above thirty or forty people behind the\r\nbarriers, but all the windows were occupied by armed men. He counselled\r\nconcession, but Polignac would not hear of it. He said Polignac was\r\n_l'homme le plus présomptueux_ he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Louvre was attacked the Swiss ran out towards the Tuileries and\r\ncarried with them a battalion he had in the Place de Carrousel, as well as\r\ntwo guns he had with him. The rush was such he could hardly get upon his\r\nhorse, and the men ran so fast that a person he sent after them on\r\nhorseback found them almost at the extremity of the Tuileries garden.\r\nHowever, some returned to protect the retreat of about sixty men whom he\r\nhad got together to defend the grille at the Arc de Triomphe in the Place\r\nde Carrousel. They were just enabled to retreat.\r\n\r\nMarmont is violent against the Swiss, who were, he says, retained in the\r\nFrench service by higher pay and privileges for _this very thing_, and yet\r\nthey ran away in this shameful manner.\r\n\r\nMarmont means to go to Italy for a year. After that he hopes he can return\r\nto France. He has no wish to emigrate.\r\n\r\nIf the account in Lord Stuart's report be correct, France is in a\r\ndeplorable state. In many parts of the country no taxes are paid, and the\r\nRepublican party has not lost hope.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of what Don Pedro considers a conciliatory arrangement are\r\nentirely inadmissible. They are founded upon the marriage of Donna Maria da\r\nGloria, and England, France, and Austria are to guarantee her against any\r\n_injure_ she may receive from her husband. Certainly we may safely say\r\nthese terms are inadmissible, and so break off all negotiations with Don\r\nPedro, who, since these terms were proposed by him, has recognised the\r\nindependent Regency of Terceira. By-the-bye, one of his terms is the\r\npayment, by Portugal, of all the expenses incurred by himself for Donna\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nIt seems the draft of a decree of amnesty has been sent to Lisbon, and if\r\nMiguel will pass that decree we are to recognise him.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor and others seemed to think this was an awkward time, and we\r\nhad better wait a little. I think so too. However, undoubtedly our early\r\nrecognition of Miguel might lead to the prevention of a Portuguese\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThere was much conversation respecting the Bank Charter. It seemed to be\r\nthe general opinion that Government should take it upon itself to arrange\r\nterms with the Bank, which terms will be prohibition to any other Bank to\r\nissue notes within twenty-five miles of London. This being granted, the\r\nBank will do the public business for 100,000£ a year less. The whole\r\nquestion of country banking, whether it is to be with limited or unlimited\r\nresponsibility, a limited or an unlimited number of partners, is to be left\r\nopen to Parliament.\r\n\r\nI suggested that the most important question was the revision of taxation.\r\nMy view now is that we must take off some of the taxes which press most on\r\nthe poorer classes, and have an income tax. I dislike an income tax as much\r\nas any one. To me it is a very oppressive tax, but I believe it may become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWalked to the corner of Hyde Park with Lord Rosslyn. Had some conversation\r\nwith him respecting the changes necessary in the Government before we meet\r\nParliament. He says Lord Althorpe will not come in without Lord Grey, and\r\nhe is not sure Lord Grey would not stipulate for Lord Durham. The latter is\r\nout of the question on account of his temper. I do not think the Government\r\ncould go on with the Duke and Lord Grey. Of the Huskissonians, Palmerston\r\nis the only one. To E. Stanley there is no objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 26._\r\n\r\nAt 3 Count Moltke came to the office. He had two Danish claims to speak\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nDinner at the Albion for Clare. There were present of the Ministers, Peel,\r\nRosslyn, Goulburn, Herries; then Lord F. Leveson, Calcraft, the Solicitor-\r\nGeneral, W. Peel, Lord G. Somerset, Planta, Gen. Macdonald, Col. Fitz-\r\nClarence, Lord Tenterden. Of Clare's friends Glengall, Agar Ellis, Sneyd,\r\nLord Templeton, besides H. Vyner, and Upton, who go with him.\r\n\r\nI spoke feebly, not being well; besides, I did not think it in good taste\r\nto make a great speech; but to leave Clare's the first speech of the day.\r\nPeel made a very good speech; but too much of it. Clare really spoke very\r\nfeelingly and well. He spoke a little too much of his gratitude to the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nI had some conversation with Loch. I was as well received as I expected,\r\nand better, considering the run that has been made at me. The Duke went off\r\nto Walmer Castle, very wisely, for he wants sea air; but Clare would have\r\nbeen more pleased had he been present, and the Directors too. The\r\nMinisters' healths were well received.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 28._\r\n\r\nReceived from Elphinstone his remarks upon the proposed letter to Bombay,\r\nrespecting native education, of which he generally approves. He strongly\r\nurges the sending out of European professors, young men, acquainted with\r\nEnglish literature, to learn the language there, and teach the natives. I\r\nhave sent the extract from his letter to Astell, suggesting that the\r\nUniversities of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, and Edinburgh should each name\r\nthose from whom should be selected the necessary number. I have observed\r\nthat the object of native education is of such importance that the state of\r\nthe finances must not prevent its accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 30._\r\n\r\nWrote a very long letter to Hardinge on the present position of the\r\nGovernment and our policy. I gave my opinion that any accession of men\r\nwhich destroyed the unity of the Duke's Government would do harm. That we\r\nmust meet our difficulties by measures. That the first was a revision of\r\ntaxation, that no men we could get would add moral strength to the\r\nGovernment, and the Whigs would not support unless they had half the\r\nGovernment. That the question of Reform could not be made an open question.\r\nIt was best for the country that parties should be decidedly separated. It\r\nmight then choose which it preferred, and men would be obliged to take a\r\nside. We had better be out with character than in with a detachment of the\r\nenemy, in possession of a gate. Still TALK we must have, and we want a\r\nfinancier. I said of myself that I cared little about office. I should\r\nwithout reluctance acquiesce in retirement if the Duke could fill my office\r\nmore advantageously, and I believe Rosslyn would do. I thought Rosslyn\r\nwould like Ireland or Paris.\r\n\r\nI do not think it improbable Hardinge may send this letter to the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 31._\r\n\r\nAn insurrection at Brussels, the houses of the Ministers burnt. The troops\r\nfired and killed many. They, not being 1,500, retired to the park, and\r\nformed before the palace. An evening paper I got at Ashford says the\r\nnobility had joined the people, and the troops had acceded on condition of\r\nkeeping their arms, and guarding the palace. If this Revolution takes the\r\nline of union with France, war is almost inevitable. It may be only for a\r\nmore popular form of Government, but what the people of the Netherlands\r\ndesire is annexation to a great State. They are ashamed of being Dutch.\r\n\r\nMost fortunately all our manufacturers are in full employment, and the\r\nharvest is abundant. The peace and constitution of England have depended\r\nupon fine weather.\r\n\r\nClare, from whom I heard to-day, tells me Lord Wellesley assures him there\r\nis to be a Revolution in Spain, and named the day. The nobles are supposed\r\nto be at the head of it. This may all be true, for our Ministers never find\r\nanything out; but my apprehension is that there will be a low, ill-\r\nsupported revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Lady Londonderry. She first wishes me to obtain, if\r\nI can, Ward's exchange to a better climate. This I have told her I have\r\nalready endeavoured to do; but that I have no expectation of Aberdeen's\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nLady L. says her brother was two hours with the Duke, and as long with Lord\r\nGrey. The latter would have acted a second part, but the Duke would not\r\nadmit him. I have told her I think she must have misunderstood Lord\r\nCamden's account, and that she may be assured it is not the Duke's\r\ncharacter to fear an equal.\r\n\r\nI sent her letter to Hardinge, and asked him if he knew anything of the\r\naffair. I cannot imagine when it can have taken place. Lord Camden was an\r\nodd person to employ. He knows so little of Lord Grey. Rosslyn would have\r\nbeen the natural envoy if it proceded from the Duke; but I think it must\r\nhave been a volunteer of Lord Camden's.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 2._\r\n\r\nRead the papers relative to the Danish claims. Canning seems to have\r\ndecided one case, that of the Danish East India Company, hastily. However,\r\nwe cannot undo a decision of a Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe other case, that of the private individuals at Tranquebar, has been\r\ndetermined in their favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 3._\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation with Herries, with whom I rode for a long time,\r\nrespecting affairs, both here and abroad. He is rather downcast. However,\r\nhe thinks this Belgian insurrection will be put down. Rothschild has\r\nexported 800,000£ in silver and 400,000£ in gold to meet his bills when\r\nthey become due--diffident of having anything paid to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 5._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Found Lord Rosslyn there. He told me the substance of a\r\nreport I did not see of Col. Jones, who was sent by the Duke to the\r\nNetherlands, and is returned. He says the Prince of Orange is with 1,600\r\nmen in the park and palace at Brussels; 5,000 men are close at hand under\r\nPrince Frederick of Orange, at Vilvorde, and two bodies of 10,000 each are\r\nmarching upon the same point. The troops at the palace have twelve guns.\r\nAll the troops show a good disposition.\r\n\r\nThe first deputation from Brussels was rather insolent. They were treated\r\naccordingly, and told to return without cockades, &c. They did so, and the\r\nPrince agreed to go into Brussels without troops. There was a great crowd,\r\nand for a moment he was separated from the staff and the Garde Bourgeoise,\r\nand alone in the midst of the people. He leapt his horse over a barrier and\r\nso got back. A Commission of very respectable men has been appointed to\r\ninvestigate grievances. So the thing will rest till the meeting of the\r\nStates on September 13.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter from Lord Heytesbury giving an account of his\r\nconversations with the Emperor of Russia. The Emperor is violent against\r\nthe Bourbons; says very correctly that his treaties only oblige him to\r\nmaintain a constitutional King. Still he may recognise, but shall always\r\nconsider the Duke of Orleans as a usurper.\r\n\r\nPrussia seems very prudent; disposed to recognise, but to state the\r\ncondition of peace--that the territorial possessions of 1815 shall be\r\nmaintained. Austria seems to be less prudent. Metternich sent to Bernstorff\r\nthe answer he intended to give, which required a declaration of not having\r\nany intention to interfere in the affairs of France, but required a pledge\r\nas to the observance of the Treaty of 1815 before recognition. Bernstorff\r\nvery prudently advised Austria to recognise unconditionally.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards seem to have been in great consternation at first.\r\n\r\nThe Minister (Addington) thinks the King and Queen are so popular, and the\r\npublic interest is so much directed to the Queen's approaching\r\naccouchement, that no revolutionary movement of importance is likely to\r\ntake place. He deprecates, however, the commencement of any such movement,\r\nbecause he thinks it would enable the Apostolical Party [Footnote: The name\r\ngiven in Spain and Portugal to the Absolutist and Clerical Party.] to\r\ninduce the King to dismiss his present quiet Ministers, and have recourse\r\nto measures of rigour, which would infallibly ruin the dynasty. Spain, and\r\nindeed all the Powers, seem to look for instruction to England, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that all will recognise and all be quiet. Salmon, when he\r\ncommunicated to the King the events in France, said, 'Your Majesty sees how\r\ndangerous over-zeal is in a Minister. No one could be more devoted to the\r\nRoyal Family than Prince Polignac.'\r\n\r\nThe King said, 'I see it.'\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding this, they say he is so weak that he may adopt a\r\nviolent course.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more correct than the conduct of M. Molé, the French\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He is most anxious to preserve\r\npeace in Europe, the new King's Government in France, and himself in\r\noffice. He is much alarmed by the events in Belgium, and wished our\r\nMinister to join the French Minister at Brussels in recommending some\r\nconcession to the King of the Netherlands. The Duke has, as Rosslyn told\r\nme, written a memorandum to serve as the basis of Aberdeen's dispatch, very\r\ncivil indeed to Molé, very much satisfied with the disposition evinced by\r\nthe French Government, but, in our ignorance of the real state of things,\r\ndeclining to advise the King of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIt is very amusing to see the French Government most _liberally_ permitting\r\nthe Bonaparte family to return to France, and most _prudently_ sending\r\ncirculars to all the Ministers of the Powers which signed the protocols of\r\n1815, urging them in the name of that treaty not to allow the members of\r\nthe Bonaparte family to leave their present residences.\r\n\r\nIt seems this is very necessary; for although their partisans can do little\r\nwithout their presence, they might do much with it.\r\n\r\nMartignac has got together sixty members of the Chamber of Deputies who\r\nwill act _en masse_ for royalty.\r\n\r\nThere is no military force to keep people in order, and the National Guard\r\ndoes not like doing so. In fact the Revolution is not over. Things may go\r\non as they are, but we have as yet no security. The French seem heartily\r\nsick of Algiers. It costs a great deal of money. Tropical products will not\r\ngrow there. The climate does not suit the French troops, who have besides a\r\nmost extraordinary _maladie de pays._ They must send 15,000 men more there\r\nto maintain it, as now they have no more than the town. They are willing to\r\ngive it up to the Sultan if he will renounce tribute, &c.\r\n\r\nI never considered the acquisition of importance to France. I always felt\r\nwe might vex the French to death by the use of a little money which would\r\nat any time have brought forward all the Arabs from the desert. The port\r\nwill only hold a few vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia proposes to cut the Greek question short by proposing\r\nthe crown at once, without the intervention of France, to Prince Frederick\r\nof Orange, and if he should refuse, then to Prince Charles of Bavaria, who\r\nwe know will accept.\r\n\r\nI should say from all I have read to-day that if France should make an\r\naggressive movement all Europe would be united against her as in 1813; but\r\nif she remain quiet within her own frontier no Power will wish to molest\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to observe the increased prudence and reasonableness of\r\nthe great States; their general union, and the deference which in the hour\r\nof danger they all show to the opinion of England.\r\n\r\nThere are some apprehensions, I hear, of riots at Manchester. There is no\r\ncause for them. All men can get work. I would put them down with a strong\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 6._\r\n\r\nSaw at the office Colonel Monteith.\r\n\r\nThe King of Persia has about six millions sterling left in his treasury in\r\ngold and silver, besides jewels unsaleable on account of their high price,\r\nbut which might be estimated at four millions more.\r\n\r\nThere will be a civil war on the death of the Shah.\r\n\r\nAbbas Mirza might succeed if he had energy, but he is the weakest man on\r\nearth. Probably all the Rajahs will be put down and some new dynasty\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs are not likely to serve the Russians at any time. The Persians\r\nare fine men and make excellent soldiers, bearing heat and cold, but not\r\nwet and damp. Officers there are none.\r\n\r\nThe Russians lose 10,000 men a year in Georgia and Caucasus, and it costs\r\nthem about 500,000£ a year. They have never conquered the country.\r\n\r\nThe cession lately obtained from Turkey has enabled the Russians to put\r\ndown the robbers who lived in Abkasia; [Footnote: The country at the\r\nwestern end of the Caucasus.] but it is of no value for purposes of\r\noffensive war--of some for defence.\r\n\r\nIt is cheaper in the proportion of 100 to 220 to send goods to Tabriz by\r\nTrebizond than by the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe Imaum of Muscat carries on a large trade in opium between the Red Sea\r\nand China. He carries British manufactures to the Indus, and trades\r\nextensively with Cochin China, where sugar is half the price it is in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Crown Prince's army all speak Turkish. It is more\r\nimportant to have at the head of it a man of energy than one conversant\r\nwith Persian.\r\n\r\nHis rank should be increased, as now he is made to rank below the last\r\nmember of the Mission.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed state of Persia has driven much trade to the Indus which was\r\ncarried on by the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nPersia may now be considered not as a monarchy, but a Federative State, all\r\nthe King's sons being independent Princes.\r\n\r\nColonel Monteith was at Algiers--the only Englishman in the army. There may\r\nhave been twenty foreigners in all. He had letters of introduction and got\r\nthere in a transport, taking his chance of being sent back. He was with the\r\nintendant of the army, and at the siege was attached to a division.\r\nBourmont offered to receive him in his family. Bourmont was hated and\r\ndespised. He seemed to take very little trouble about the army, and to\r\nleave everything to the generals of division. On the 19th, the day of the\r\nbattle, he lost 600 men by not advancing sooner. The moment he advanced the\r\nenemy fled. The loss was 2,200 men in all, yet fifty were never to be seen\r\ndead and wounded together. The loss was by skirmishing at long shots along\r\nthe whole of the line. This sometimes lasted all day, and the troops, being\r\nyoung, were too foolhardy. The Arabs are a miserable race, half naked.\r\nEverything beyond Algiers seems a desert. For eight miles round Algiers the\r\ncultivation is beautiful, and the villas more numerous than near any town\r\nhe ever saw. A profusion of water. The town, miserable in the extreme,\r\ninhabited by Moors and the descendants of Turks, about 50,000. The port is\r\nformed by one pier which hardly protects two or three frigates. There is no\r\nsafety in the bay.\r\n\r\nThere were 3,000 Turkish soldiers in Algiers, and about 7,000 in the\r\ncountry. These kept order. Now they are sent away the French may colonise\r\nextensively, but they cannot keep the country with the present inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Dey had ten millions sterling in gold and silver, a treasure which had\r\nbeen accumulating since the time of Barbarossa. [Footnote: A famous corsair\r\nof the sixteenth century.] He claimed 400,000£ as his own, and was allowed\r\nto carry it away. The French enquired about the jewels of the Regency. The\r\nDey said there were no jewels but those which belonged to his wives, and\r\n_la galanterie Française_ would respect them as private property. So they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThere was a magazine containing 250,000£ of things in the trinket line.\r\nThere were 150 ornamental daggers, all the presents of European princes,\r\n&c. Colonel Monteith saw one officer coolly put into his pocket a watch set\r\nin diamonds, which had evidently been given by a King of England, worth, he\r\nsupposed, 2,000£.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lavardo pillaged more openly than any one. He had thirty soldiers\r\nemployed in carrying off his pillage.\r\n\r\nThe affair at Belida was accidental. Bourmont went out with 1,600 men and\r\ninvited the chiefs to meet him. They were coming peaceably; but some Arabs\r\nsaw the French artillerymen taking their horses down to water without their\r\nguns, and they could not help attempting to steal. The artillerymen beat\r\nthem off; but the firing having begun was soon converted into a battle.\r\nBourmont beat them off, but thought it expedient to retreat.\r\n\r\nThe beach was particularly favourable for landing. The weather fine, and\r\nthere was plenty of time to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe thing best done was by General Valagi, who in eighteen hours raised a\r\ncontinued work of a mile and a half. He had 1,600 sappers and miners.\r\nColonel Monteith is in admiration of this entrenchment, which was\r\nbeautifully finished, and was capable of resisting 30,000 regular troops.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs are miserably mounted. The Dey's two best horses were not worth\r\n30l. each.\r\n\r\nDuperre he thought a man willing to do all, but quite overpowered by the\r\nmanagement of 100 ships of war and 500 transports. His reports are all\r\nlies. Bourmont's are nearest the truth. The ships, with the exception of\r\nthose which were in the Levant, were not in good order. There seemed to be\r\nno discipline.\r\n\r\nThe army never wanted either water or provisions. Water was within three\r\nfeet of the surface everywhere. In the gardens on the side of the hills\r\ntowards Algiers the water was found at the depth of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more perfect than the equipment of the army. They\r\ncalculated the cost of the expedition at four millions.\r\n\r\nI see by the newspapers that the Prince of Orange yielded the point of the\r\ncolours to the deputation from Brussels. He seems to have conceded a great\r\ndeal, but to have acted with great personal courage and decision. It is\r\nexpected that the Commission he appointed have asked for the separation of\r\nHolland from Belgium, and the establishment of a Federal union only; two\r\ncountries under one King with distinct legislatures, armies, &c. The great\r\ntowns are quiet. Holland ready to march upon Brussels.\r\n\r\nI shall not be satisfied unless some of the Bruxellois are hanged for\r\npillage.\r\n\r\nThe answers of the King seem to have been firm and judicious.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to admire the constancy of the troops, who bivouacked\r\nfor eight days in the park.\r\n\r\nThe French Government seems too weak or too timid to prevent outrage in\r\nParis. The printers' devils will have no machinery for printing! It is\r\nentertaining to see those who make all revolutions suffer by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 7._\r\n\r\nSaw Greville at the Treasury. He told me he had got from Lord Chesterfield\r\nthat Palmerston had no objection to come in. Lord Melbourne had; but they\r\nrequired the sacrifice of Aberdeen, Bathurst, and Arbuthnot. There must be\r\nsome mistake about this condition. I told Greville if he could get a _fact_\r\nto communicate it to the Duke.\r\n\r\nIt is feared the Prince of Orange is gone away to the Hague. He promised\r\nColonel Jones he would be firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 8._\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange certainly went to the Hague. He was received there\r\nenthusiastically. The proposition he takes is for Federal union. I fear he\r\nmust submit to some modification of that, or encounter real opposition and\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 9._\r\n\r\nHardinge gives me rather an indifferent account of Ireland. Great animosity\r\nstill existing between the Catholics and Protestants in the _lower_ ranks;\r\nin the higher, peace. A revolutionary disposition raised in the middle\r\nclasses by the example of Prance. Great dissatisfaction in consequence of\r\nthe proposed taxation of last session.\r\n\r\nHe told the Duke, and so did Arbuthnot, that he might dispose of their\r\noffices if he wanted them. He seems to think Peel is tired and anxious to\r\nwithdraw--annoyed at the idea of being unpopular, an idea the defeat of his\r\nbrothers has given him. This makes him less energetic than he should be\r\nwith respect to the measures necessary to strengthen himself in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 10._\r\n\r\nIt seems the desire of separation is general in the Netherlands. It is the\r\nresult of national prejudice and vanity. The Dutch seem just as violent the\r\nother way, and the deputies were rather in danger at Rotterdam. The\r\nseparation will probably defeat the objects of the great Powers in 1814,\r\nfor it is idle to expect such terms of Federal union as will enable the two\r\nStates to act cordially together.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 11._\r\n\r\nBy withdrawing his troops from the palace, and going to the Hague, the\r\nPrince of Orange has ruined his cause. He has appeared to give it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 13._\r\n\r\nRead on my way to London the intelligence obtained by Lord Heytesbury\r\nrelative to the Russian trade with Tartary and on the Caspian. It is very\r\nfull and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe 'Times' has a sensible article on the state of France; the want of\r\nmaterials to form a constitutional monarchy, the growing dissatisfaction\r\nthat _more_ is not done in a revolutionary sense, and the irresponsible\r\npower of a deliberative army of 800,000 men.\r\n\r\nGhent and Antwerp seem to cling to the connection between Holland and\r\nBelgium, and I begin to hope that if France is tranquil the Bruxellois and\r\nLiègeois may grow tired and become reasonable. Men cannot play at\r\nbarricades long when no one attacks them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 14._\r\n\r\nHouse of Lords. I had to wait half an hour for the seals, which were\r\ncarelessly carried off by Lady Lyndhurst in her carriage.\r\n\r\nTalked to Rosslyn. He told me Aberdeen was led to expect another revolution\r\nin France. The paper they were going to prosecute was an _affiche_ calling\r\nupon the French people to overthrow _l'aristocratie bourgeoise_, which was\r\nas bad as the other, and to divide the lands.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands the people and their leaders are divided, and if Antwerp\r\nand Ghent, &c., remain firm, it signifies little what Brussels does.\r\nBrussels will be brought into terms by distress.\r\n\r\nRosslyn thinks some of the Whigs as well as of the Tories will be alarmed\r\nby events on the Continent and support Government.\r\n\r\nHe hears of no negotiations for accessions.\r\n\r\nThe people of Brunswick, very justly provoked, have turned the Duke\r\n[Footnote: This was the eccentric Duke who died a few years ago at Geneva,\r\nbequeathing his whole property to the city, who have erected a monument to\r\nhim.] out of the town and burnt his palace. He escaped with ten Hussars. He\r\ndeserves his fate. I believe he is mad. He is a complete _vaurien._\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament is prorogued, as to-day, the peers are without their robes.\r\nThe Chancellor was in his legal dress. The Commons appear without a summons\r\nby their clerks, and the Chancellor merely desires the proclamation to be\r\nread. However, as it is held, _improperly,_ to be the first day of the\r\nsitting of Parliament, the return of the Scotch peers is laid on the table.\r\nAll this is sanctioned by precedent, but contrary to reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 20, 1830._\r\n\r\nWrote a long letter to Hardinge upon the political consequences of\r\nHuskisson's death, [Footnote: He was killed, as is well known, at the\r\nopening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.] urging the introduction\r\nof Palmerston and Stanley. The latter to Vent the junction of the Whig\r\naristocracy with the Radicals.\r\n\r\nI am sure, if measures are not taken immediately, we shall have all the\r\nHuskissonians, Whigs and Ultra-Tories (the last are insane), united against\r\nus.\r\n\r\nReceived from Sir J. Malcolm a letter with some enclosures about suttees.\r\nHe has reluctantly and fearfully abolished suttee, making it culpable\r\nhomicide to assist, and murder to force the victim. He has done it, I\r\nthink, wisely by a repeal of a clause in one regulation and an amendment.\r\nThus not putting it vainly forward as Lord William did in a pompous\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nHe has abolished the Military Board, I believe, very wisely; but there may\r\nbe a difficulty with the Duke, if I cannot do it without talking to him\r\nabout it. I believe Sir J. Malcolm is quite right, and that there would\r\nhave been no hope of preserving a system of real economy had the Military\r\nBoard been permitted to remain.\r\n\r\nI am curious to see his measure of checks on expenditure, that if it be\r\ngood it may be adopted at the other Presidencies.\r\n\r\nReceived some letters from Lord W. Bentinck. Lord Dalhousie has been very\r\nill, and the command of the army would fall, Lord William says, into the\r\nweakest hands, if anything happened to him.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the army was becoming better, I gather from Lord William's\r\nletter, but it required much attention. I have been thinking all day of\r\nwhat measures may be adopted for improving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 21._\r\n\r\nOffice. Read to Cabell my memorandum on the alterations which might be\r\nintroduced into the army, which I wrote hurriedly this morning. He was long\r\nin the military department, and can be of much use. Cabinet room. I think\r\nthe result of Lord Stuart's dispatches is that the moderate party are\r\ngaining strength. I should say the facts we see in the newspapers lead to a\r\ndifferent conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers and the old leading members of the Chamber of Deputies act\r\nmanfully against the crowd. Their declarations of intention are\r\nsatisfactory. I really believe they mean to act honestly if they can.\r\n\r\nAustria seems to have hesitated about the acknowledgment of the King of the\r\nFrench after the receipt of a dispatch from Petersburg, and Metternich, who\r\nseems to be growing weak, wavered after he had received General Belliard\r\nvery cordially.\r\n\r\nPrussia, that is _the King,_ hesitated about signing the letter to Louis\r\nPhilippe when he heard of the doubts of Austria. The result, however, is\r\nthat all _entrainés_ by us will acknowledge; the Emperor of Russia, who was\r\nthe most reluctant, having determined to do so if the others did. I should\r\nsay there is this satisfactory conclusion to be drawn from what we have\r\nseen, that if France showed a disposition to aggrandise herself all Europe\r\nwould be against her.\r\n\r\nThe object of the French Government is to place France exactly in the\r\nposition in which she stood a fortnight before the ordonnances--that is,\r\nTalleyrand's wish, and he has _rédigé_ his own instructions.\r\n\r\nRead Aberdeen's letter, dated the 17th, stating the necessity of\r\nmaintaining cordial intercourse with and between Spain and Portugal, and\r\nintimating that on the promulgation of an amnesty according to the terms\r\nrecently communicated England will resume diplomatic relations with Miguel,\r\nbut not otherwise.\r\n\r\nSpain seems to be sensible. There was a movement of folly about Royalist\r\nvolunteers which was put down, and the Government seems by no means\r\ndisposed to give way to Absolutists. If the Queen should have a son Spain\r\nwill probably be tranquil.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand pretends the French will be reasonable about Algiers. I do not\r\nwish them to be so. I believe they could not have made a worse purchase.\r\nThey will find the possession very expensive. Their troops will hate it,\r\nthey will have nothing beyond their outposts, and it is no port.\r\n\r\nMy first opinion is strengthened, that they could not be worse than if they\r\nwere left as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 24._\r\n\r\nThe populace and the burghers at Brussels have quarrelled, and fought a\r\nlittle. It seems the Liberals and the Catholics, [Footnote: They have\r\nformed the two opposing parties in the Belgian Chambers since the country\r\nbecame an independent State. They had temporarily united against Protestant\r\nHolland.] as the others are called, have been long diverging. The deputies\r\nand men of property, excepting M. de Stassart, have become alarmed. The\r\nPrince de Ligne and D'Aremberg and others have left Brussels. On the 21st,\r\nprobably the 20th, in the evening a proclamation was published at Antwerp\r\nby Prince Frederick of Orange, noticing the excesses of the populace, and\r\nannouncing that the troops would relieve the burgher guard. This must have\r\nbeen done in concert with the influential persons of the town who are\r\nalarmed for their property. The Liégeois are very violent. They will be\r\nexpelled from Brussels. No more can get there, as the road is interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch have but 20,000 men, of whom the Belgians are as three to five.\r\nThe Belgians had begun to desert, but they did not join the Bruxellois in\r\nany numbers. The hanging of some of the Brussels mob would have an\r\nexcellent effect.\r\n\r\nThe Government of France seems to become weaker, and to permit things which\r\ndiscredit it.\r\n\r\nA night or two ago some _ouvriers_ insisted on going into the King's\r\nbedroom, after he was gone to sleep, woke him, and made him make a speech\r\nsitting up in his bed. Twelve departments have united against indirect\r\ntaxes, and few pay those which are direct. Meanwhile, the Algerine treasure\r\nhas been pillaged by the officers of the army, and ships clearing for\r\nToulon go elsewhere to land it. They want a loan, while the fallen\r\nGovernment would have had a surplus. They will find the raising of a loan\r\ndifficult. The French are displeased by the coldness of Austria and\r\nPrussia, and by the marching of Austrian and Prussian troops.\r\n\r\nThe King of Saxony has resigned, or rather he has associated his nephew\r\nwith himself as Co-Regent; the brother waiving his claim to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe Landgrave of Hesse Cassel was met by a deputation requiring him to do a\r\nnumber of public acts, and amongst the rest the dismissal of all\r\nmistresses. It seems the Electoral Prince has one to whom he is going to be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Brunswick lately galloped off _lui Troisième_ while his palace\r\nwas burning!\r\n\r\nThese are odd times!\r\n\r\nHowever, here people seem to be inclined to be quiet. Even the Common\r\nCouncil have by a large majority decided against congratulating or noticing\r\nthe French people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 26._\r\n\r\nBrandreth told me there was a report of the Belgian troops having entered\r\nBrussels, and of a great massacre. There will be news to-morrow as the wind\r\nis down.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 27._\r\n\r\nNo direct news from Brussels yet. There has been fighting for two days, and\r\nit was known at Antwerp that the first regiment that entered was nearly\r\ndestroyed. It seems the invitation of one section was a ruse.\r\n\r\nThere are to be no Cabinets for eight or ten days, the Civil List not being\r\nprepared. When we do meet we are not to separate.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be every expectation of a new Ministry in Paris, and in the\r\nrevolutionary sense.\r\n\r\nI saw Aberdeen. He rather expects it.\r\n\r\nRead the report of the Commission appointed to form the articles of\r\naccusation against the Ministers. It is a party speech, with little points\r\nand prettinesses, affecting moderation, and full of rancour. It is a nation\r\nwhich has no idea of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 28._\r\n\r\nCabinet room. Dispatches of the 24th and 25th from Sir Ch. Bagot; but none\r\nfrom Mr. Cartwright. When Sir Ch. Bagot wrote last thirty hours had elapsed\r\nwithout official intelligence, although the distance is only thirteen\r\nhours. It was known there had been hard fighting, that it was necessary to\r\ntake in succession every house in the Rue Neuve Royale, that the troops\r\nwere in possession of the upper part of the town, and a proposition had\r\nbeen made by the lower town for a cessation of hostilities, after which\r\nthey had recommenced.\r\n\r\nIt is evident the resistance has been most serious. 20,000 French are in\r\nthe town, and these probably direct the defence. All clubs, and councils of\r\nall sorts, had ceased to have power two days before the attack. There has\r\nbeen perfect anarchy. The troops behaved admirably. They were much\r\nexasperated. No assistance had been sent by the country.\r\n\r\nAberdeen is confident the King's troops have been driven out, because no\r\nofficial accounts were sent. The Duke, and all the military men, say the\r\nnon-arrival of dispatches proves nothing but that the affair was not over.\r\nDuring an engagement a general can think of nothing but victory. The\r\nimportance of the result is incalculable.\r\n\r\nAt Paris the National Guard have dispersed a meeting of lookers on, who\r\nwere led by curiosity to crowd about a riding school in which the Society\r\nof Les Amis du Peuple met the day after they were denounced by Guizot in\r\nthe Chamber as agitating France. Two officers of the National Guard entered\r\nthe riding school, and warned the meeting of the danger they were bringing\r\nupon public tranquillity. On the representation of the second they\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\nAt dinner at Lord Rosslyn's the Duke said the French Government could not\r\ngo on as it was. The chief of the National Guard necessarily commanded\r\neverything. The National Guard might become janissaries. I think the\r\nGovernment may go on as it is _in form,_ but it will vary _in substance_\r\nfrom day to day. Management, a little good fortune, and a few examples of\r\ndetermination may make it a fair Government; a single error may produce\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke gave an excellent account of the feeling at Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nand Birmingham. At Manchester it was better than at Birmingham, but there\r\nthey received very coldly Tennyson's speech about giving them members, and\r\nat last put an end to it by striking their glasses with their knives, which\r\nmade such a ringing that Tennyson was obliged to sit down. He deserved this\r\nfor his bad taste.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was astonished by the machinery. Those who have witnessed the\r\nimprovements of late years expect progressive improvements so great that\r\nthey say a man who laid out 100,000£ now in the best machinery would, if he\r\nrefused to adopt the new improvements they anticipate, be without profit in\r\nfive years and be ruined in ten.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of motion is so great in the steam carriages that even the\r\nDuke with his quick eyes could not see the figures on the posts which mark\r\nthe distance at every quarter of a mile, and when two steam carriages\r\ncrossed no face could be seen. [Footnote: This was on the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railway, then just opened, and describes the first impression\r\nmade by railway travelling.] It was like the whizzing of a cannon ball. The\r\ncold is great, and they must have some defence against the wind, through\r\nwhich they pass so rapidly.\r\n\r\nA new canal without locks, which brings coals to Birmingham in two hours,\r\nwhich by the old canal required nine, is more magnificent even than the\r\nrailroad, splendid as that is. The railroad cost a million. For several\r\ndays after it was opened the proprietors made 250£ a day.\r\n\r\nThe King has the gout. The Duke goes to Brighton to-morrow. We dine with\r\nhim on Thursday. Cabinets will not begin till next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 29._\r\n\r\nNo news in the newspaper from Brussels. No dispatches from Sir Ch. Bagot or\r\nMr. Cartwright arrived at the office; but a gentleman who left Brussels at\r\nfive on Sunday reports that they were then fighting in the town, but the\r\ntroops had the worst of it.\r\n\r\nThe Consul at Ostend reports that the King's troops evacuated Brussels on\r\nSunday night; that reinforcements from the country were pouring into\r\nBrussels; that there had been an attempt at insurrection at Ostend, which\r\nwas put down for the time by the Governor, who killed two and wounded six;\r\nthat eleven or twelve men had marched in from Bruges, which was in\r\npossession of the Bourgeois; that Ghent was expected to rise, and in a few\r\ndays all Belgium would be separated from the King.\r\n\r\nA son of Holmes of the Treasury arrived at the Foreign Office at four, and\r\nsaid he had left Ostend at three yesterday, when there was a report that\r\nthe Dutch had made another attack and had recaptured the park.\r\n\r\nIt seems they never had more than the park. They had to take, and did take,\r\nthe Rue Royale. They were more thoroughly masters of the Place Royale. They\r\nplanted guns against the town, which were answered by guns from the rebels.\r\nAt five on Sunday the latter were gradually advancing, and picking off the\r\ntroops in the park.\r\n\r\nThe first day some rockets were fired and eighteen houses burnt; but Prince\r\nFrederick ordered the discontinuance of this, the only efficacious mode of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nLord Blantyre was killed. He was lame and on a sofa, but curiosity led him\r\nto crawl to the window and peep out, when a ball struck him in the\r\nforehead. Lady Blantyre and his children were with him. He was much\r\nesteemed. He was in the Peninsula, and a gallant officer.\r\n\r\nI think the employment of European officers in civil situations under\r\nnative princes may be very useful to their subjects; and while we do not\r\nourselves employ natives in high situations, to force all native princes to\r\nemploy them is to make a striking contrast between their Government and\r\nours, very injurious to ours.\r\n\r\nJones seemed to hesitate and to think I committed myself. However, I feel\r\nsure of my ground.\r\n\r\nA letter from Lord Cleveland, expressing a wish to have the Vicarage of\r\nIlchester, and offering an equivalent living in Shropshire, or Cheshire.\r\n\r\nI sent his letter to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, saying I should be much\r\nobliged to him if he could make the arrangement, Lord Cleveland being a\r\nfaithful and powerful supporter of Government.\r\n\r\nTold Lord Cleveland I had transmitted his letter with a strong\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nI made my letter as agreeable to the Bishop as I could, but I dare say he\r\nwill refuse. Very likely he has given away the vicarage. I told Lord\r\nCleveland I thought it probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 30._\r\n\r\nThe Consul at Antwerp writes a long foolish letter in much alarm.\r\n\r\nMr. Cartwright's reports are come. He describes a horrible carnage. The\r\nevents much as we know them. Sir A. Bagot says his Russian colleague has,\r\nwith the consent of the King and the Dutch Ministers, written home to say\r\nBelgium can only be preserved by foreign aid.\r\n\r\nAt dinner at the Duke of Wellington's met Talleyrand and Vaudreuil. The\r\nothers there were Aberdeen, Goulburn, Herries, Murray, Beresford, Lord F.\r\nSomerset, and Rosslyn.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand is not altered since 1815, except that he speaks thick. He has\r\nnot even changed his hairdresser or his tailor.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn showed me a letter from Lady Janet, who was in Brussels during\r\nthe fight. She walked about frequently, and was treated with civility by\r\nthe armed burghers. A few grape-shot fell into the courtyard, and she\r\npicked up one. She was at the Hotel de Brabant in the Rue Neuve. There was\r\nno pillage, nor any riot. The loss of the people was great. She left the\r\ntown on Sunday (I think) with a passport from Count Hoogwoorst, and got\r\nround to Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe troops are said to have lost only 600 men. Prince Frederick is about\r\ntwo leagues from Brussels, on the road to Louvain, waiting for heavy guns.\r\nThis is the report. I suspect he will retreat altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 1._\r\n\r\nOn consideration thought it would be better to have a secret letter on the\r\npress, authorising the Government to allow their servants to be connected\r\nwith the press. To this letter I thought it advisable to add an exhortation\r\nto redoubled zeal on the part of the Company's servants on account of the\r\nunsettled state in which the minds of men must be until it was decided\r\nunder what form the future Government of India should be administered, and\r\nI directed the Government to make all thoroughly understand that no\r\npossible change could effect the public debt, or the rights of the natives\r\nor the just expectations of the European servants. My reason for thinking\r\nthe officers of Government should be permitted to be concerned in the press\r\nis this, that if none but those who are unconnected with the Government,\r\nand who, according to the existing system, cannot be connected with it,\r\nmanage the press, the probability is that everything will be said against\r\nthe Government and nothing for it.\r\n\r\nI showed the proposed letter to the Duke. He thought it would be better to\r\npay people for writing than to employ the Company's servants, and that the\r\nconcluding paragraphs would lead the Government to suppose it was quite\r\ndecided that the Company should be put an end to. It is wonderful the sort\r\nof prejudice he has in favour of the Company. He thinks that unless\r\nDirectors selected writers and cadets we should have an inferior sort of\r\npeople in India. I have no objection to the patronage being in a corporate\r\nbody, but I am satisfied the present system leads to a degree of delay\r\nwhich is more mischievous than misdirection. He acknowledges, however, that\r\nthe service is much changed. The exhibition made by Courtenay Smith has\r\nproduced a strong impression upon his mind. He has done more injury to the\r\nCompany in his mind than all the evidence. He still seems unwilling to make\r\nhis opinion up against the continuance of the monopoly. It must fall,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nThe King wishes to have Sir E. Barnes appointed provisional successor to\r\nLord Dalhousie. The Duke thinks him a better man than Sir R. O'Callaghan,\r\nwho was suggested by Lord F. Somerset. I suggested that it would be\r\nexpedient to unite the influence of Governor-General with that of\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and make Lord William Bentinck provisional successor.\r\nThe Duke seemed to think Lord William could not execute both duties, and\r\nthat it was better to adhere to the general usage of separating the two\r\noffices. It seems that after Lord Hastings' return the Court intimated a\r\ndisposition to separate the offices in future. I can do nothing against the\r\nKing, the Duke, and the Horse Guards; but I am satisfied it would have been\r\nbetter to send Sir E. Barnes as second in command to the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe King (Lord F. Somerset told me) was desirous of doing away with the\r\nCompany's European regiments. He could not do a better thing. He has\r\nlikewise some notion of bringing the army under himself. The Duke thinks it\r\nmust be a _local army,_ and certainly it must. [Footnote: In accordance\r\nwith this view Lord Ellenborough opposed the eventual amalgamation of the\r\nQueen's and the Indian army.] I believe it is better to make it an army of\r\nthree Presidencies, not one army. My doubt is whether it would not be\r\nadvisable to allow exchanges from the King's army to the Company's.\r\nEverything would be beneficial that raised the tone of the Indian army.\r\n\r\nThe Duke showed me a draft letter he had written for Aberdeen to Lord\r\nStuart, informing the French Government that the King of the Netherlands\r\nhad required the assistance of his allies to re-establish his authority in\r\nBelgium. That it was as much the interest of France as of other Powers to\r\nput down a revolution not carried on by the higher or the middle, but by\r\nthe lowest classes of the people. That we were desirous of concerting with\r\nFrance, as one of the contracting parties to the Treaty of Vienna, what\r\ncourse should be now adopted. It could not be supposed the Allies would\r\nforego the advantage of the union of Belgium and Holland for which they had\r\nsacrificed so much.\r\n\r\nThis was the substance of the letter. It will not be sent without the\r\nconcurrence of the Cabinet, which will be summoned the moment Peel comes to\r\ntown, and he is hourly expected.\r\n\r\nI think this letter prudent, inasmuch as whatever may happen it will place\r\nus in the right; but I do not expect that France will do anything against\r\nthe rebels, or sanction the doing of anything.\r\n\r\nThe Duke considers, as indeed is clear enough, that it is idle to expect\r\nthe future submission of Belgium to the King of the Netherlands. It may be\r\npossible to place it under a Prince of the House of Nassau. I do not think\r\nthe Duke sees his way; but he expects war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 2._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Aberdeen's letter to Lord Stuart. It is founded upon the Duke's\r\nmemorandum, but much extended _à l'Indienne_. I think none approved of it\r\nbut Lord Bathurst. I objected to the statement that the treaty of 1815\r\nimposed upon us _obligations_. It may give us _rights_, but it imposes no\r\nobligation. Then the principle of non-interference is advanced as just and\r\nwise, but there are peculiar circumstances attending the position of the\r\nNetherlands which make a difference.\r\n\r\nThere is an assertion that the troubles in Belgium have been fomented by\r\nFrench agency, although not assisted by the Government, and a direct\r\nreference is made to the Barrier Treaties. France is requested to concert\r\nwith us and the Allies to _suppress_ the anarchy which exists in the Low\r\nCountries. She is at the same time reminded that in no case can the Allies\r\nconsent to renounce the security given to them by the Treaty of Paris in\r\nconsequence of an insurrection amongst the lower orders at Brussels. Of\r\nthis a great deal will be left out. Peel seemed to be rather averse to the\r\nwhole tenor of the letter, which looks like an invitation to put down the\r\ninsurrection by force. He sketched in a few words a letter which would be\r\ninnocuous.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's object is to make an effort to induce France to act with us to\r\nsettle the Belgian affairs amicably. They cannot be settled _without_\r\nFrance, without a war. But is there any hope that the French Government\r\nwill venture to give us her _appui_? If they be self-denying enough to\r\nrenounce the hopes of annexing Belgium to France, their fears of the\r\nJacobins will not allow them to do so. My expectation is that they will say\r\nthey neither have interfered nor will interfere to dissolve the union\r\nbetween Holland and Belgium. That they will not interfere in the internal\r\nconcerns of other States.\r\n\r\nSome think they will go farther and declare they will not allow other\r\n_Powers_ to do so. I do not expect this.\r\n\r\nEvery word of this letter must be well weighed, for every discontented man\r\nin England and in France will criticise its words and its spirit. There is\r\nno writer more unsafe than Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nRosslyn did not seem to like the letter at all, but he said little. I\r\nwhispered to Peel that I wished he would bring a letter to-morrow. _Short_.\r\nIt was at last agreed alterations should be made, and we are to meet at one\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nPeel takes the letter home, and will, I trust, cut it down.\r\n\r\nThe King Charles X. is in danger of being arrested, of which he naturally\r\nhas a great horror, and he desires to be allowed to go to Holyrood House,\r\nwhere he would be safe. At Lulworth they are afraid of the Due de Bordeaux\r\nbeing kidnapped. The pretence is the getting masters from Edinburgh for the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIt may be feared that the placing him in a royal residence may look or be\r\nrepresented as looking like recognition. On the other hand his removal from\r\nthe southern coast to Scotland is a renunciation of intrigues with France.\r\n\r\nIt would be inconvenient if the King should wish to go to Edinburgh next\r\nyear. Charles X. is to be told he cannot stay there after the spring.\r\nHowever, he will probably live there all his life.\r\n\r\nIt would be a revolting sight to see a King imprisoned for debt, and all\r\ngentlemen, all men of feeling, would have cried out _shame_!\r\n\r\nWe are right in feeling, but in policy I am not sure.\r\n\r\nNieuport has fallen as well as Ostend. The Bruxellois are drilling, and\r\nthreaten to attack Prince Frederick. Probably Van Holen drills them to keep\r\nthem quiet.\r\n\r\nMany people have applied to Falck [Footnote: Dutch Minister.] for passports\r\nfor Brussels, going in reality to join the rebels. Today two Irish\r\nlabourers asked for passports! Brussels will become the sink of Europe, and\r\nevery unquiet spirit will go there.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks our attempt to make France act in concert with us the only\r\nchance of preserving peace.\r\n\r\nI fear its preservation is almost desperate. One thing is in favour of it,\r\nthat all the European States desire it yet more than we do.\r\n\r\nI cautioned them to-day not to take any advanced position from which it\r\nwould be difficult and discreditable to retreat. The people would not go in\r\nwith us in a war to avert a distant danger, nor indeed for any object not\r\ncommercially interesting.\r\n\r\nIt came out accidentally in the course of conversation respecting the loan\r\nto the Netherlands that we had lent 20,000£ to the Greeks; the sum to be\r\nrepaid by bills to be drawn by our Commissioner whenever the loan we are to\r\nguarantee may be made--that is, we are to be paid out of our own money.\r\n\r\nOf this loan I knew nothing, and my impression is that when it was\r\nearnestly pressed by Aberdeen such objections were stated on the ground of\r\nillegality that the decision was against it. Certainly nothing was decided\r\nin favour of it. I recollect having said I would rather advance a portion\r\nof the money myself than be a party to the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 3._\r\n\r\nCabinet. The Consul at Ostend announces that nothing remains to the King of\r\nthe Netherlands but Antwerp. The troops have everywhere laid down their\r\narms. On the 1st the Brussels papers announce that orders had been issued\r\nby the provisional Government for arresting all the Dutch officers.\r\n\r\nPeel read first the dispatch written by Aberdeen with the omissions agreed\r\nupon, and then his own substitutions. His is much the best. It speaks of\r\n'composing troubles' instead of 'suppressing anarchy,' avoids all mention\r\nof interference, and altogether is a more prudent paper, touching the\r\nBarrier very slightly. It was understood that Peel's was adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is determined to allow the King, Charles X., to go to Holyrood House,\r\nbut he will be told there is no furniture, or very little, and that he can\r\nonly stay six months, and that no expense can be incurred on his account.\r\nHe has admitted no one to an audience, but many have been to Lulworth to\r\nask for places.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand says they have found an _ébauche_ of Polignac's, telling\r\nBourmont that his proposal that the money taken at Algiers should be given\r\nto the Legion of Honour could not be complied with, as the King intended to\r\ndistribute it amongst his most faithful friends. They pretend they do not\r\nintend to make use of this because there is no proof of its having been\r\nsent; in fact they do not use it because it reflects credit on Bourmont.\r\n\r\nLord Rosslyn, with whom I walked as far as Pimlico Palace, showed me the\r\nTreasury list of the House of Commons. 311 decided friends and 189 enemies-\r\nthat is 500; the remainder, consisting of moderate Tories, violent Tories,\r\ngood and bad doubtfuls, as well as Huskissonians (the latter 13), are more\r\nlikely to be against us than for us.\r\n\r\nRosslyn still hankers after a coalition, but reform has made it impossible.\r\nWe might have had this time last year Sir J. Graham. We might even now have\r\nPalmerston, [Footnote: It appears from Lord Palmerston's published papers\r\nthat this was an error. He had already determined to act with the Whigs,\r\nand not to take office without Lord Grey and Lord Lansdowne. See Ashley's\r\n_Life of Lord Palmerston_, vol. i. p. 211.] but the Duke seems determined\r\nto go on as he is, Peel and all, even Bathurst, seem to have a correct view\r\nof the danger; but I see no flinching.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 4._\r\n\r\nSaw the Duke. Suggested that we must soon consider what should be done with\r\nrespect to the China trade. If we were to give up the monopoly we had\r\nbetter do so at once, on the first day of the Session, with a good grace,\r\nand not make ourselves appear to do it with reluctance. The Duke said we\r\nmust certainly consider it. Had I talked with the Chairs about it? I said\r\nno. I had thought it best to wait till the Cabinet had come to a decision\r\nas to what should be done. I had privately advised them to turn over in\r\ntheir minds the plan of the Company going on with the Government slightly\r\nvaried, but without monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said he could not make up his mind without hearing first what the\r\nChairs had to say. I observed that if they, that is Astell, thought the\r\nGovernment hesitated, they would certainly say they could not go on without\r\nmonopoly. However, the Duke seemed to think it was impossible for the\r\nquestion to come before the Cabinet before we had talked with the Chairs.\r\nSo I have asked him and Loch to meet at the Treasury at twelve on Monday.\r\n\r\nI should like to see Tucker and Stuart, but I must do it privately, as I\r\nhave no principle to go upon in consulting with individual Directors.\r\n\r\nThe Duke seems very reluctant to give up the monopoly, and to have very\r\nexaggerated ideas of the value of the Company's intervention.\r\n\r\nHe showed me a letter he had received from Molé, in which he takes a very\r\nmoderate view of the Belgian question. Expresses the most earnest desire\r\nfor peace, as war would place everywhere the two extreme principles in\r\nconflict. France will not interfere, neither can she suffer others to\r\ninterfere, in the internal affairs of the Netherlands. He hopes to be able\r\nto arrange everything amicably.\r\n\r\nA letter the Duke showed me from Rothschild's brother is still more\r\nsatisfactory if the view taken in it be correct. He says France will, _with\r\nEngland and the Allies_, amicably settle the question; but she will not\r\nhave to be excluded.\r\n\r\nHe mentions Leopold as a probable King of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Turin [Footnote: The first French Republic had made a similar\r\nnon-recognition a plea for seizing Savoy.] seems to be in a great fright\r\nbecause the French Government took huff at their not recognizing at once.\r\nThey were afraid to do so till they heard what the great Powers did.\r\n\r\nM. de la Tour says they can bring 60,000 or 90,000 men into the field, if\r\nGenoa is guarded for them by a fleet; but Genoa would require 14,000 men.\r\nOn that place they must retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards seem to be going on well. They mean not to be _empressés_\r\nwith their recognition, but are advised not to be the last.\r\n\r\nThere have been insurrections at Hanau, Swerin, and I know not where else.\r\nThe Diet intend to vary the law of the Empire and to allow any neighbour,\r\nwhose assistance may be asked, to give it at once.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia received General Athalia very graciously, but he\r\nkeeps him waiting for his answer. Lieven professes himself well satisfied\r\nwith our reasons for immediate recognition. So does Metternich. In fact\r\nthey cannot do without us, and if we lead they must follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 5._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Goulburn's Civil List. He transfers to the Consolidated Fund all\r\nthe salaries heretofore partly paid by the Civil List, and in diplomacy\r\nthere is a reduction of 28,000£ a year.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed there can be no reduction in the great departments in the\r\narticle of tradesmen's bills, or in the Board of Works.\r\n\r\nThe King gives up the Droits [Footnote: 'Droits of Admiralty.'] without any\r\ncompensation. This is all a loss to the privy purse.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to reduce perspectively many officers in England and in\r\nIreland who do not really contribute to the state of the crown. This,\r\nhowever, did not occur to Goulburn but to Peel.\r\n\r\nThe account of Liege is very bad indeed. Things there seem going on in the\r\nstyle of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nNothing can be better than the account from France. They will be pleased by\r\nthe letter read to them. All they feared was the attempt to exclude them\r\nfrom all concert in the settlement of Belgium. They think neither the King\r\nnor Prince Frederick can return to Brussels; but the Prince of Orange may,\r\nand this will, I think, be finally settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 6._\r\n\r\nCouncil at 2. Talleyrand was presented. He backed to the window and read a\r\nspeech in which there were several erasures. He declared the determination\r\nof France to pursue the course so wisely followed by England of non-\r\ninterference. He spoke of himself as 'Ministre d'une Royaute votée à\r\nl'unanimité.'\r\n\r\nThe King did not much like receiving him, and was a little nervous. To what\r\nTalleyrand said about noninterference the King answered it was a very good\r\nthing, especially when exercised _de bonne foi_. This he said by Aberdeen's\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nI read the King of the Netherlands' letter. He asks distinctly for\r\n_military assistance_.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at the Duke's. The Prince of Orange is gone to Antwerp. This\r\nthe Duke thinks the very worst step that could have been taken; the only\r\nmistake the King has made. In fact the King was unwilling, and ever since\r\nthe affair of Brussels there has been a coolness between the King and the\r\nPrince. The Duke fears the consequences of the Prince's going, because he\r\nis a man devoted to popularity-vain. The Duke and Talleyrand were talking\r\nabout popularity. The Duke said those who loved it never loved it with\r\nmoderation. Talleyrand said, 'Il n'y a jamais de modération, où il n'y a\r\npas de _goût_--et il n'y a pas de gout dans l'amour de la popularité!' The\r\nDuke asked Talleyrand what sort of a man the Duke of Orleans was. 'Un\r\nPrince de l'Ecole normale.' Of the Queen he said, 'Elle est bonne femme, et\r\nsurtout grande dame--c'est ce qu'il nous faut.'\r\n\r\nTalleyrand said he had given the King a piece of advice, '_to go to\r\nNeuilly_'--that is, to rescue himself from the vagabond cortége.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand is very well pleased with the letter sent to Paris, and the\r\nforeign Ministers are satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe King (our King) seemed to me to be very weary to-day. Aberdeen said he\r\nwas a good deal distressed at the state of Europe, and rather anxious.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Holland and Rothschild appear to be the only people besides\r\nthe Ministers who have called on Talleyrand. Lord Holland is very much with\r\nhim. Lord Holland is doing all he can to save the lives of the French\r\nMinisters--for the interest of the French Government, not of the Ministers\r\nthemselves. He has written to La Fayette and to the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 7._\r\n\r\nI forgot on what authority it was mentioned yesterday, but it was mentioned\r\nas a fact that the Liberaux would not have done anything unless they had\r\nbeen certain of the Duke of Orleans. So afraid were they of a revolution\r\nthat they would have submitted to the Ordonnances rather than run the risk\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 9._\r\n\r\nAt Canterbury heard more particulars of the machine-breaking now going on\r\nin the neighbourhood. Notice is given, and the frames are broken. One\r\ngentleman boasted at market they should not break his, as he had armed men\r\nto protect them. They on the same night set fire to his rickyard. Sir Henry\r\nOxenden's sons went out to meet them, when they came according to notice to\r\nbreak Sir Henry's machines. One man spoke for the rest. He acknowledged Sir\r\nHenry seldom or ever used his machine, and that he was the landlord in Kent\r\nwho gave most to the poor; but they must do as they were ordered; they\r\nwould, however, do as little as they could, and they only sawed off a\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe farmers now leave their thrashing machines out in the fields to be\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThe rickyard of one gentleman was set on fire because he committed a man\r\nfor machine-breaking. He lost 6,000£, nothing being insured.\r\n\r\nIt seems suspicions are entertained that the machine-breakers are not all\r\nof the station they assume. They all wear smock frocks, but their language\r\nis better than their dress. When money was offered them, if they wanted it,\r\nby the Oxendens, they said they did not want money, they obeyed orders.\r\n\r\nIt is reported, but this must be an exaggeration, that 500 assembled lately\r\non a Down near Mr. Brockman's.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates have no good evidence against any. Some Bow Street officers\r\nare here. Lord Winchelsea and Sir Edward Knatchbull have been here at every\r\nmeeting of the magistrates, although they live eighteen miles off.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government of Belgium have declared the independence of the\r\ncountry and the defeazance of the House of Orange. In the meantime the\r\nPrince of Orange is arrived at Antwerp, as Viceroy, with a Belgian Etat\r\nMajor Civil.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable the Chamber of Deputies will abolish the punishment of\r\ndeath for political offences, and so save Polignac.\r\n\r\nThe levy of 108,000 men will hardly make the French army 240,000 effective,\r\nfor it was not full before the Revolution, and numbers have deserted;\r\nbesides the disbandment of the Guards, which was 25,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 11._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Aberdeen read Lord Stuart's account of his interview with Molé.\r\nMolé suggests an immediate conference, and thinks the Prince of Orange may\r\nbe made Sovereign of La Belgique. No communication will be held by the\r\nFrench Government with the Provisional Government of Belgium. They will\r\ncommunicate through the King.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to have the Conference here. The Ministers of Austria,\r\nPrussia, and Russia have expressed their readiness to acquiesce in anything\r\nproposed by this country. They may inveigh against the diplomacy of\r\nEngland, but in moments of danger all rally under our wing.\r\n\r\nMolé distinctly admitted that the existence of the present Government of\r\nFrance depended on its remaining on good terms with England and Prussia,\r\nand the affairs of Belgium gave them an opportunity of showing _la droiture\r\nde leurs principes_, &c.--in short, of gaining a good character.\r\n\r\nIt was decided against guaranteeing the sum of 500,000£ the Dutch wish to\r\nraise here. There would be no end to such loans if we once began to assist\r\nthe credit of foreign States. Parliament would not approve of the measure.\r\nTo the Dutch Government it is important that this Administration should\r\nremain, and likewise that their own credit should not be injured in all\r\nEurope by the confession of weakness which their recourse to us implies.\r\n\r\nTo guarantee a loan is to give money, and to do that is to assist one of\r\nthe parties to lose the mediatory character, and, in fact, put ourselves\r\nout of the Congress.\r\n\r\nHardinge can reduce 57,000£ a year in net and on the Civil List, 30,000£ on\r\nthe Pension List, and 27,000£ on officers of State.\r\n\r\nWe had some talk about details, but Goulburn does not reduce as much as\r\nHardinge.\r\n\r\nHad some talk with the Duke and Peel respecting the fires in Kent, and the\r\nbreaking of frames. Five are in prison. The Duke thinks smugglers are at\r\nthe bottom of it.\r\n\r\nThere has been alarm at Carlisle. The officers in command of the castle\r\napprehended an attempt to surprise it and seize the arms. Men had been seen\r\nmeasuring the wall. Sir J. Graham was alarmed about it. Orders will be\r\ngiven to provision for thirty days all the places where arms are kept, the\r\ntown included, where there are 600,000 stand of arms. In the meantime all\r\nclasses are more comfortable in this country than they ever were, and this\r\nalone keeps down insurrection. There are leaders but no troops.\r\n\r\nHardinge reports that the spirit in Ireland is _disimproved_ since the\r\nevents in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThere is to be an Anti-Union Society, which, as soon as it meets, will be\r\nput down under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 12._\r\n\r\nAt nine went to Apsley House. Met the Chairs. We went in to the Duke. Our\r\nconversation lasted two hours. As they are to send in a _procès verbal_, it\r\nis unnecessary for me to state it. The substance was that, supposing the\r\nmonopoly to be taken away, they would administer the Government of India as\r\nheretofore on one of two conditions; either closing their account with the\r\npublic and receiving payment in full, or an equivalent annuity for all\r\ntheir property in India, in which case they would require no guarantee of\r\nthe present dividend; or making over all their property, and taking a\r\nperpetual guarantee of the dividend.\r\n\r\nThe public to make good in either case all deficiency of Indian revenue,\r\nand in either case the Company to be the agents for the territory,\r\nproviding all necessary sums here and receiving repayment at a rate of\r\nexchange to be paid from time to time fairly.\r\n\r\nThe Chairs were given to understand that the public being liable to the\r\nmaking good of Indian deficiency, we should require a strict control over\r\nthe whole expenditure _here_, as well as in India.\r\n\r\nThey show, especially Campbell, a disposition to leave off trading and\r\nbecome gentlemen. They were told by the Duke that if they did so we must be\r\nat liberty to revise our arrangement with them. We might as well go to the\r\nBank as to them, if we were to treat with a body not commercial.\r\n\r\nThe Duke seems much pleased with his foreign prospects.\r\n\r\nM. de Choiseul was waiting to see him. I suppose on the affair of Holyrood\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the French will abolish the punishment of death, and\r\nso save Polignac.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 14._\r\n\r\nFound at the office several papers giving accounts of Radical meetings in\r\nLancashire. All the old Radicals are reappearing on the scene. They do not\r\nas yet seem to be attended by any numerous assemblies, never above 200 or\r\n300.\r\n\r\nA letter from a clergyman at Wrotham speaks of burnings near that place,\r\nand of the bad conduct of the people who interfere with the working of the\r\nengines, and seem to rejoice in the destruction.\r\n\r\nRead all the papers relating to the education of the Princess Victoria, who\r\nseems to have been admirably brought up.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet room read a long and excellent letter of Hardinge's\r\nrespecting the state of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe 87th Regiment at Newry, when paraded for church, refused to march\r\nwithout music, to which it had been accustomed in the south. It had been\r\ndiscontinued in the north to avoid displeasing the Orangemen.\r\n\r\nThe captain sent for the Lieutenant-Colonel Blair, who was at first\r\ndisobeyed, but he placed a drum to have a drum-head court martial, and then\r\nthey marched. The Duke says it is, and always has been, the worst regiment\r\nin the service. It ran away at Salamanca and exposed him to being taken\r\nprisoner. It has always been unmilitary, and from the same cause, a\r\ndisposition to seek popularity on the part of its officers. Hardinge\r\nproposes embarking it at once for the West Indies. The Duke prefers\r\nbringing it to Dublin, where there are other regiments to keep it in order,\r\nand soon sending it to England, and by detachments at no distant period to\r\nBotany Bay. They do not expect there will be any further exhibition of\r\nmutinous spirit. The only mischief of this is the effect at this time.\r\n\r\nThere have been apprehensions of an attempt to scale the Pigeon House, and\r\na full garrison has been ordered into it, with directions to add to its\r\ndefences on the seaside so as to protect it from escalade.\r\n\r\nHardinge can bring twenty guns together in a very short time, at any point\r\nin Dublin. He talks of arming the students in Trinity College in the event\r\nof an explosion.\r\n\r\nThey rather expect an explosion about the 18th or 19th, when probably there\r\nwill be the first meeting of the new Association.\r\n\r\nThis it will be the first object to put down by the Act of 1829. The\r\nmeeting to petition for the repeal of the Union will be permitted.\r\n\r\nHardinge is quite himself on horseback. The only fear is that he should be\r\ntoo lively. Peel seems to think he is; but it is a great comfort to have\r\nhim there instead of Lord Francis Leveson, who was always wrong.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Netherlands has called his States at the Hague, the\r\nConstitution requiring them to meet this year in Belgium. He takes\r\nadvantage of the provision in the Constitution which permits him to call\r\nthe States in Holland in case of war. They fear the loss of Antwerp. The\r\nPrince of Orange thinks things look better.\r\n\r\nThe Netherland Ambassador is much annoyed at the refusal of pecuniary\r\nassistance; but, as was expected, the Dutch have got their money, only\r\npaying a little more for it.\r\n\r\nOur depots are only 160 strong. We have hardly a battalion. One or two at\r\nleast of those which were going abroad will be retained for a time.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Brunswick does not much like abdicating. The Duke of Wellington\r\nthought he had brought him to make his brother Governor-General for his\r\nlife, retaining the succession for his children. However, Aberdeen seems to\r\nhave blundered him back again. He is to go to see the King on Saturday. The\r\nKing desired he might come early, that he might not be obliged to have him\r\nto dinner, and he desired Aberdeen would remain in the room.\r\n\r\nPozzo thinks the French Government is gaining strength; but they are very\r\ninefficient in preventing armed men from assembling on the frontiers of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe French have exercised such coldness towards the Belgians that they are\r\nbecome unpopular. De Potter was French while he had hopes of becoming so.\r\nNow he is a Republican.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians will send troops into the Sardinian dominions if there is any\r\ninsurrection. [Footnote: They had similarly interfered to put down the\r\nConstitutional movement in Piedmont which followed on the Neapolitan\r\nrevolution of 1821.] This by invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Spain has, it is said, a son. [Footnote: It was a daughter,\r\nafterwards Queen Isabella II., born October 10, 1830. The alteration of the\r\nsuccession in favour of the female line led to a civil war on Ferdinand\r\nVII.'s death. A son might have secured peace, but probably without a\r\nConstitution.] This event would, it is thought, secure Spain against any\r\nrevolutionary movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 15._\r\n\r\nCalled on the Duke. Settled with him the alterations necessary in the\r\nChairs' memorandum of the conversation on the 12th. He thought we had gone\r\ntoo far in leading them to expect they should be repaid the money they had\r\nsunk in the territory while they held the Government.\r\n\r\nReceived from him the opium letter. He thinks the principle good, but\r\nconsiders it is not fair to make the Scindians prevent the transit of\r\nopium. We cannot prevent them, for they are independent; but unless we\r\nendeavour to persuade them, and succeed in doing so, we shall lose our\r\nopium revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 16._\r\n\r\nChairs at 11. Head over with them my alterations of their protocol. Astell\r\ndid not seem to see the greatness of the variations. Campbell did, and\r\nparticularly observed upon the words, 'value of the fixed property in India\r\nwhich might be adjudged to appertain to the Company in their commercial\r\ncapacity.' He wanted an admission of the justice of the claims, leaving\r\nnothing for adjustment but their amount. I said we could not admit claims\r\nwithout examination, the nature of which we did not yet know. All we could\r\nadmit was that the claims were such as should be submitted to examination,\r\nand their validity decided upon just principles.\r\n\r\nAstell wished to go back again and recommence the discussion. I said he\r\nknew I could decide nothing without the Cabinet, and he nothing without the\r\nCourt; all he had to do now was to bring the subject before them.\r\n\r\nHe asked whether they were distinctly to understand that the Cabinet had\r\ndecided upon the termination of the monopoly? I said that the question not\r\nhaving yet been before the Cabinet I could not give an answer officially;\r\nbut when the First Lord of the Treasury and the President of the Board of\r\nControl desired to know what the course of the Court would be in the event\r\nof its being proposed that the Court should administer the Government\r\nwithout monopoly, I thought it was not difficult to draw an inference.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 19._\r\n\r\nSent to the Duke a memorandum on his letter. Read at the Cabinet room. The\r\nKing of the Netherlands is much annoyed at the desertion, as he thinks it,\r\nof his allies. He now proposes a Congress of the Four Powers and _France_\r\nat Breda or Cleves. He admits France very unwillingly, and by no means\r\nacquiesces in the reasoning in favour of the advance we made.\r\n\r\nSir Ch. Bagot seems to think the Prince of Orange will be losing the\r\naffection of the Dutch without gaining the Belgians.\r\n\r\nThe German Confederation is arming in the neighbourhood of Hanau for the\r\npreservation of the peace. They have put 6,000 or 7,000 men in motion, and\r\nhave a reserve of 15,000 or 18,000.\r\n\r\nThe excitement against Polignac and Peyronnet increases, and the Ministers\r\nrun the hazard of their places by attempting to save them. I fear that is\r\nhopeless. The Spanish Radicals seem to find it would be dangerous to pass\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 20._\r\n\r\nOffice. Cabinet room. The Prince of Orange has written a most offensive\r\nletter to the King of the French, almost insinuating that the troubles in\r\nBelgium are fomented by France, and saying that by a declaration against\r\nthe Belgians France would show her good faith, and secure the recognition\r\nof Russia. The French Cabinet is much offended at the silence of the King\r\nof the Netherlands, and Count Molé is going to write to the Dutch Minister\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nNesselrode seems to see great difficulties in the intervention of France in\r\nthe settlement of Belgium--the union of Belgium and Holland having been\r\nmade _against_ France. The Russian Minister at the Hague has general\r\ndirections to follow the course of England upon all points not provided for\r\nby his instructions.\r\n\r\nThere is a great fall in the Funds to-day; partly, it is said, in\r\nconsequence of those who desired to keep up the Funds being no longer able\r\nto do so; partly from the general aspect of affairs. My surprise is that\r\nthe Funds have not fallen before, and much more.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at the Duke's. Showed the protocol of our Conference with\r\nthe Chairs. The heads of the speech were read. Aberdeen's will not do at\r\nall. To my surprise he intended to announce the recognition of Miguel, he\r\nhaving engaged to do a great act of justice; that is, to publish the\r\namnesty. He will not do it till a British Minister arrives at Lisbon; that\r\nis, he makes us, whom he has once deceived, dependent upon his word. This\r\nwould be a very incautious step on our part. We meet on Friday to consider\r\nthe speech in detail.\r\n\r\nWe had a good deal of conversation about the Duchess of Kent's allowance,\r\nwhich is to be much increased. It is proposed to give her 20,000£ a year.\r\nShe has now 12,000£ for herself and the Princess, out of which she pays\r\ninterest and insurance upon 12,000£ she borrowed on the Duke of Kent's\r\ndeath for her outfit.\r\n\r\nThe King has about thirty people at dinner every day, belonging to the\r\nHousehold. His expense must be enormous in living.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 21._\r\n\r\nRead in the newspaper the King of the Netherlands' speech. It is querulous\r\nand angry. I really thought the Proclamation _extraordinary_ of the Prince\r\nof Orange a forgery; but it is genuine, and he throws off all connection\r\nwith Holland, declaring the independence of Belgium, and placing himself\r\npractically at the head of the Rebellion!\r\n\r\nOn Monday night at a dance at the Lodge, Hardinge saw accidentally in an\r\nevening newspaper, shown to him for another purpose, the advertisement of\r\nthe Anti-Union Association, and by seven o'clock the next morning the Lord\r\nLieutenant's Proclamation prohibiting it was placarded in the streets. This\r\nis decision. There was no riot. Persons in general were satisfied the act\r\nwas right. O'Connell is alarmed. The Duke of Leinster is ready to sign a\r\ndeclaration in favour of the Union. All is safe in Ireland with Hardinge's\r\npromptitude. I wish he could remain and not come over to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 22._\r\n\r\nSaw Campbell, who was very nervous and anxious, and I at night wrote a\r\nletter to Lord Hill in favour of his son--more, I admit, from a father's\r\nfeelings than from a conviction of being right.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Lord Lieutenant not having been near Dublin when the\r\nProclamation was issued by Hardinge, he must have had a blank Proclamation\r\nin his pocket, and have issued it without the opinion of the law officers.\r\nHe has good debatable Parliamentary grounds of defence; but he has trodden\r\nupon the margin of the law. Not the worse for that in these times, when it\r\nis most important that every one should see the Government are vigilant and\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nValdez, who entered Spain with a few hundred men, has been smashed at once.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet we had a long discussion respecting the Regency question.\r\nAberdeen started the objection that the proposed measure was destructive of\r\nthe principle that the King could not die. On the other hand it was\r\ncontended that we maintained that principle. We made a Regent for _a King_.\r\nWe acknowledged _a King_; but we deferred taking the oath of allegiance\r\ntill we knew who he was. The difficulties attending the _unkinging_ of a\r\nSovereign on the birth of a Prince nearer to the present King seem greater\r\nthan any attending the measure proposed. It was ultimately determined that\r\nthe Chancellor should consult the judges and the law officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 23._\r\n\r\nCabinet. Twenty-six magistrates at Canterbury sentenced to three days'\r\nimprisonment threshing machine breakers, who pleaded guilty! Such has been\r\nthe terror struck into them! Sir E. Knatchbull was in the chair.\r\n\r\nWe went through the speech--not deciding absolutely upon the words; but\r\ngenerally upon the substance.\r\n\r\nThen arose a conversation as to the Regency which, in this last hour, is\r\nthought a point of importance. The Chancellor seems alarmed and unwilling\r\nto move the suspension of the rights of the presumptive heir until the non-\r\nexistence of an heir apparent be ascertained, without the opinion of the\r\njudges. It is admitted there is no written opinion to guide us. The analogy\r\nof property is in favour of the heir presumptive; that of peerage in favour\r\nof the heir apparent _in utero_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 24._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 4. Read two letters from Hardinge. By his account all the men of\r\nproperty will support the Government and the Union.\r\n\r\nThe press is coming round--_bought_. A Mr. Conway, an able writer, is\r\nfurious against O'Connell, and, upon the whole, the Press is on our side.\r\nHardinge dilates with delight upon his military preparations and plans of\r\ndefence, and seemingly will be disappointed if he cannot put them into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Ministers resigned after the Prince of Orange's Proclamation.\r\nHe is left without advisers. He has endeavoured to get Sir Charles Bagot to\r\njoin him, and Grasioff. He sends for Cartwright. He seems much embarrassed.\r\nIn fact he is in heart a Belgian, and would sacrifice everything to be King\r\nof Belgium. He never knew the Dutch, and not unnaturally likes the Belgians\r\nbetter. They are indignant at his conduct in Holland, and with reason. He\r\nseems to intend to rule the Dutch by means of the Belgians. This he cannot\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington always thought him a silly fellow.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government is going to send some mission here.\r\n\r\nWe had a long talk about the Regency. Really it does us little credit to\r\nbegin now, within ten days of the meeting of Parliament, to consider that\r\nquestion seriously.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justices will be asked whether, supposing the Queen to be\r\npregnant at the death of the King, the next living heir would succeed? How\r\nin the event of the birth of a child the _de facto_ Sovereign is to be put\r\naside? And what should be done if the Queen only may be with child? The\r\ndifficulty consists in the oath of allegiance, which must be altered and\r\nmade conditional. But what a curious position the Queen Victoria would be\r\nplaced in, if a baby were to oust her after eight months of reign!\r\n\r\nI think the course adopted will be this--to make an oath of allegiance\r\nconditional, saving the rights of a child to be born; to appoint the Regent\r\nwho would be named for the Princess Victoria, with the provision that on\r\nthe birth of a child the child's mother shall be Regent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 25._\r\n\r\nCabinet at 4. Peel read letters he had received from Mr. Foster, the\r\nmagistrate of Manchester, Mr. Hulton, of Hulton, and a manufacturer whose\r\nname I forget. They all give an alarming account of the state of\r\nManchester. The colliers have turned out in some districts, and where they\r\nhave turned out the mills are necessarily stopped. This has thrown numbers\r\nout of employment. These colliers can earn 10_s_. a day; that is, as much\r\nas many clergymen. The spinners can earn 5_s_. a day. Yet they turn out.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a manoeuvre like that of Lafitte when he refused to\r\ndiscount bills. To stop the supply of coal is to throw all mills out of\r\nwork, and every one out of employment. The question is, Shall the masters\r\nresist? If they do, there will be an early collision. If they do not, they\r\nmay defer it, but not long. Concession was counselled six weeks ago, on the\r\nground that, after the events in Belgium and in France, collision was\r\ndangerous; and this even by bold men. It seems there are 3,000 infantry, 3\r\nguns, and about 600 or 800 cavalry near Manchester. Perhaps some howitzers\r\nmay be sent, but more force there is not. Peel at the Cabinet wrote a\r\nletter to Mr. Taylor, saying that under ordinary circumstances he should\r\nhave counselled resistance or rather non-concession; but now it was a\r\ndoubtful question whether a collision at Manchester would not lead to\r\ncollision in many other places, and was our force sufficient? He was\r\ndesired to see Mr. Hulton, Sir E. Bouverie, and others, and to consider\r\nwhat could be done, particularly whether Volunteer Corps could be formed.\r\nThe delegates who went to Mr. Chappell seem to be amenable to the law and\r\nget-at-able. This will be done.\r\n\r\nThe law officers came in and were asked as to the power of the Crown to\r\npermit the formation of Volunteer Corps. They were desired to consider the\r\npoint. By the Act of 1794 there seems to be no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nHardinge is arrived. He has been calling out O'Connell. I am sorry for it,\r\nfor O'Connell had declared he would not fight. O'Connell had called him the\r\nDuke's aide-de-camp. So far it does good, that it lowers O'Connell still\r\nmore, and destroys the value of anything he might say against Hardinge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 26._\r\n\r\nCalled on Hardinge. He says the accounts from Manchester to-day are worse.\r\nIn the House Lord Hill showed me a letter (from Sir E. Bouverie, I think),\r\ngiving a very alarming account--30,000 out of work, and apprehension of\r\nearly collision.\r\n\r\nParliament opened. Took the oaths. Office. Lord Dalhousie was so ill on\r\nJune 4 that I have no idea of his being now Commander-in-Chief in India.\r\n\r\nReceived a summons to a Cabinet at four _precisely_, and went to the\r\nForeign Office; but nobody came. I think it must have been summoned to meet\r\nat Peel's house. The times are so critical that I should be sorry to lose a\r\nCabinet. I could not find out that any summonses had been sent from the\r\nForeign Office. There was a crowd of people in Downing Street, who had, I\r\ndare say, followed the Duke from the House of Lords. There were a good many\r\nabout the House. All quite quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 27._\r\n\r\n_Levée_ at two. Addresses from the Church of Scotland, and the Lord Mayor\r\nand Corporation of Dublin. Dr. Chalmers was with the Church of Scotland.\r\nThe Recorder of Dublin, Mr. Shaw, who is member for Dublin, made a speech\r\nbefore he read the address--a thing quite unprecedented, and which might be\r\nvery inconvenient. The speech itself was innocent. The _levée_ by no means\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nPeel had an audience of the King, and in half an hour the King slept twenty\r\nminutes. He says he never knew any man so much altered in three months. His\r\nsomnolency increases. He slept during an interview with Aberdeen yesterday.\r\nWhen the Duke saw him he was alive enough.\r\n\r\nCabinet. Prince at the Chancellor's. Some conversation respecting the\r\nburnings in Kent. Peel thinks they were effected by a chemical process, by\r\nsome substance deposited hours before, and igniting when the perpetrators\r\nare far off. The persons who met Lord Winchilsea expressed detestation of\r\nthe burnings, and went away to break threshing machines, but a man who\r\ncommitted persons for breaking threshing machines had his ricks burnt;\r\nanother suffered the same thing who defended his threshing machines. I\r\nbelieve the two offences to be committed by the same persons. The\r\nmagistrates are supine and terror-struck; but they have no police, no\r\nmilitary. Sir E. Knatchbull doubts whether they would arm as yeomen. Peel\r\ndoes not seem to me to view with sufficient alarm the effect these burnings\r\nwill produce upon men's minds, and the example of impunity. Nothing was\r\nsaid about Manchester. All seemed to think less seriously of our dangers\r\nthan they did some days back.\r\n\r\nThe law officers mean to give in their report on the case put to them to-\r\nmorrow. They will say it is not provided for. The Chancellor has the judges\r\nat dinner on Friday, and he will then obtain theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 28._\r\n\r\nCaptain Harvey of the 4th Dragoons called by the King's desire to say the\r\nKing of Persia told him when he was at Teheran that he was hurt at not\r\nreceiving a letter from the King. I told Captain Harvey the King had\r\nannounced his accession to the Shah of Persia as he had to other\r\nsovereigns. Captain Harvey was interpreter to his regiment. It seemed to me\r\nthat he rather wished to command the Persian troops. He is brother to the\r\ntutor to Prince George of Cambridge. He is a very gentlemanlike man.\r\n\r\nThe French insist on having the conferences respecting the settlement of\r\nBelgium at Paris, if there are to be any regular conferences. They cannot\r\npermit Talleyrand to act for them. The French would be jealous of him, &c.\r\nWe had wished to have the conferences here for the very reason that we\r\nthought Talleyrand would do his utmost to have the credit of preserving\r\npeace. I see there will be no Congress. The French think that, if they\r\nstand still, the fruit will fall into their mouths. The folly of the Prince\r\nof Orange will ruin his party in Belgium. The ambition of the Belgians will\r\ninduce them to attempt to form a separate State, which after much disorder\r\nwill be found impracticable; and as they will not become Dutch, they _will_\r\nbecome French. Then we shall have a war, and present forbearance only\r\npostpones it. All the Volunteers who are acting in Belgium are French. All\r\nthe forces in the field are commanded by Frenchmen. French money is\r\nemployed. The French are really now carrying on the war covertly.\r\n\r\nRussia is paralysed by the devastating progress of the cholera morbus which\r\nhas reached Moscow. The Emperor is gone to Moscow to establish order and\r\nobedience, for the civil and military authorities are quarrelling, and the\r\ntroops are unwilling to form the cordon. All cordons I believe to be\r\nfruitless. It would be as wise to form a cordon against the wind. The\r\ndisease advances, however, along the high roads and navigable rivers. It is\r\nthe most extraordinary plague we have had.\r\n\r\nPrussia cannot act for fear of disorders at home, and Austria is literally\r\nthe only power to which war is possible. The French dare not go to war for\r\nfear of a Republic.\r\n\r\nIt seems the French Ministry will be partially changed, the Due de Broglie\r\nand Guizot going out. The Due de Broglie seems to be a pedantic coxcomb.\r\n\r\nI pity the King of the Netherlands, who is a good man. To be hated by two-\r\nthirds of his subjects, betrayed by his foolish son, and abandoned as he\r\nthinks by his allies, must be great trials to him; while, although the\r\nDutch adore him and really love him, they will not give him money, and I\r\nhave a little doubt whether they will fight much. Probably, however, the\r\nfear of pillage will make them do that for themselves.\r\n\r\nRead a very well-written pamphlet in reply to Brougham's two. I suspect the\r\nwriter is Philpotts. It is too powerful for an ordinary man, and far beyond\r\nCroker. Neither is it in his style. Brougham has made Ridgway put forth a\r\nletter stating that he never communicated upon the subject of the pamphlet\r\nwith Brougham--which is no denial that it is Brougham's.\r\n\r\nIt is a good and useful pamphlet, and will teach the Whigs good manners by\r\nshowing them they cannot commit aggression with impunity. There is no part\r\nmuch better done than that in which the falsehood and absurdity are shown\r\nof what was said in the Brougham pamphlets respecting me. To be sure my\r\nchampion had a good case. What was said about me rather leads me to think\r\nLord Durham or T. Moore had a hand in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 29._\r\n\r\nThe letters from Manchester recommend resistance on the part of the\r\nmasters--that is, non-concession. This will put the colliers to the\r\nnecessity of adopting _force_, and in the defence of property we should\r\ncommence the contest, which can only be deferred, with great advantage. Mr.\r\nFoster thinks the views of the Union have been shaken by the increase of\r\nforce near Manchester; and that, although there might be much disturbance,\r\nthe event would not be doubtful. One committee of the Union has proposed\r\nacquiescence in the masters' terms.\r\n\r\nThe accounts from Kent are bad. Peel has offered to send down a magistrate\r\nand police officers, and to go to any expense.\r\n\r\nHe was to receive Mr. Hammond, Plumptree, Lord Camden, and others to-day.\r\nPoor Lord Camden, in the meantime, has the lumbago.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 30._\r\n\r\nCabinet. A very bad account of Manchester. No means of raising Volunteer\r\ncorps. Little hope of uniting the masters. The operatives triumphant. No\r\ndisposition, however, on their part to come to blows, and a confidence on\r\nthe part of the magistrates that a fight would be in their favour; but then\r\nthey must have _troops_, keep all they have, and get more if possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor recommends that constables should have the power of arresting\r\n_picketers_ without warrant.\r\n\r\nWent through the speech. It will do very well now.\r\n\r\nSpoke to the Duke about Indian finance, and told him the result. He wished\r\nto see all the papers, which were not yet quite ready. In the meantime\r\nnothing is to be done, and we are to appoint the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney and Solicitor-General deprecate the prosecution of a libel\r\ntransmitted for their opinion, and say they think it unadvisable to\r\nprosecute without the sanction of Parliament! What this means I do not\r\nknow, unless it means that they are cowed.\r\n\r\nThere is an infamous article in the _Times_ to-day, against the conduct of\r\nthe farmers and country gentlemen, and there are worse in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_.\r\n\r\nHad some conversation after dinner at St. James's with Frankland Lewis. He\r\nlongs for the Grants. I told him it would not do, and what sort of a man\r\nCharles Grant was. Frankland Lewis does not seem to like his office, but he\r\nsays he shall bring it into order if he remains there, and make it a Privy\r\nCouncillor's office without drudgery. He and, indeed, all seem to wish they\r\nwere better and more boldly led in the House of Commons. All we want is\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 31._\r\n\r\nCabinet. On Monday the 25th the Prince of Orange left Antwerp. He embarked,\r\nand intended to go to see his father, and then to come to England! On the\r\n26th General Mellinot marched in and went on to Breda, with 5,000 men. On\r\nthe 27th (there having been a parley on the 26th), the populace attempted\r\nto seize the arsenal. The citadel fired. The, town was on fire when Mr.\r\nCartwright came away, and is nearly destroyed.\r\n\r\nAt Maidstone two or three ringleaders were seized very gallantly by the\r\nmagistrates, and carried off to the gaol by the cavalry at a canter.\r\nHowever, there are but thirty-four troopers there. So four troops have been\r\nsent from Windsor, a depot from some other place, and two guns from\r\nWoolwich. All this was rendered necessary by an intended meeting on\r\nPenenden Heath to-morrow. March, the Solicitor of the Treasury, is gone\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThere was much conversation about the state of the Press, and a resolution\r\ntaken to prosecute, notwithstanding the unwillingness of the law officers.\r\nScarlet appears to be quite cowed by opposition and the Press.\r\n\r\nThis Press may be bought, but we have no money. Five-sixths of the Foreign\r\nSecret Service money are preoccupied by permanent old charges--the Secret\r\nService money of the Treasury is preoccupied in the same way.\r\n\r\nThere is a small sum of droits which may be turned over to the Privy Purse,\r\nand then by the King to the Government, but it is not more than 3,000£. It\r\nis thought that perhaps some of the pensions on the Secret Service money of\r\nthe Treasury may be turned over to the Foreign Office. The Treasury money\r\nis the only money applicable to the purchase of newspapers.\r\n\r\nWe twaddled a great deal over the speech. It was proposed by Peel to insert\r\na paragraph referring to the disturbed state of the country. He will write\r\nit, and we shall consider it in a Cabinet at St. James's to-morrow at one,\r\nbefore the Council.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst is more alarmed than any one; but Peel is a good deal alarmed\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThere is _danger_, for there are many to attack and few ready to risk\r\nanything in defence. It was otherwise in 1793.\r\n\r\nThe Duke thinks that with every disposition to do mischief there is no\r\nconspiracy, or we should have heard of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 1._\r\n\r\nCabinet at St. James's at one. The Lord-Lieutenant has prohibited, by\r\nProclamation, the meeting of the Volunteer Society. Very properly and\r\nconsistently. It was a much more dangerous society than the other. He is a\r\nfirm man, not to be turned from the course he thinks right.\r\n\r\nO'Connell has not been spoken to in the clubs he has entered. At Brookes's\r\nthey turned their backs upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was no meeting at Maidstone. Probably they had intimation of the\r\nmovements of troops. Lord Beresford told me there were 3,000 artillerymen\r\nat Woolwich, enough to serve guns for an army.\r\n\r\nWent through the speech again. Aberdeen is the most obstinate man I ever\r\nsaw, about the mere _words_ of his part of the speech. We lost half an hour\r\nat least in talking about words to-day. Peel read his concluding sentence,\r\nwhich is very good. He laments the outrages, and the attempt to disturb the\r\nconcord between portions of the empire whose union is essential to their\r\nmutual strength and happiness, declares the King's determination to exert\r\nthe powers confided to him by the Law and the Constitution for the\r\npunishment of sedition, and ends by expressing a firm reliance on the\r\nloyalty of the great body of the people.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could judge by the King's countenance when the speech was read,\r\nhe acquiesced, and thought it right, but was pained at being obliged to\r\nhold such language.\r\n\r\nI had prepared a paragraph to be used in case it had been thought right to\r\nsay anything about India. For my own part I thought it better not. We could\r\nnot produce a measure this year, and it would hardly be fair by the Court\r\nto declare to Parliament that we thought the monopoly must be put an end to\r\nwithout having previously acquainted them with our determination. The Duke\r\nsaid he had seen nothing yet to satisfy him that the revenues of India\r\ncould meet the expenditure without the China trade. I think his reluctance\r\nincreases to put an end to the present system. My disposition to terminate\r\nthe existence of the Company increases the more I see of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 2_\r\n\r\nHouse at five. Lord Bute made a very long, heavy speech. Lord Monson a very\r\nlittle one, not bad. The stuff would do; but he has neither stature nor\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nWe then had Lord Winchilsea, Lord Camden, Duke of Leinster, and Lord\r\nFarnham. Lord Winchilsea right in tone, but desiring inquiry into\r\nagricultural distress. This, too, was the burden of a mouthy speech made by\r\nthe Duke of Richmond, whom I had nearly forgotten. Lord Farnham spoke, as\r\nhe always does, well. He deprecated the dissolution of the Union, but\r\ndesired relief for Ireland. This, too, was desired by the Duke of Leinster,\r\nwho spoke very firmly, as all did, against agitators.\r\n\r\nLord Grey said it was a moment of great _danger_ and _importance_.\r\nFortitude, caution, and wisdom were required. He spoke strongly against the\r\ndissolution of the Union, and against the disturbers of the public peace\r\neverywhere. He used the words of the speech, _grief_ and _indignation_. He\r\njoined in the determination to put down sedition by law. Rejoiced no new\r\nlaws were asked for. Approved of the prompt recognition of King Louis\r\nPhilippe; lamented the _necessity_ of the French Revolution. Said 'all\r\nRevolutions were in themselves evils,' although they might produce eventual\r\ngood. Expressed his hope, for the honour of France and for the interests of\r\nLiberty, that they would not sully a Revolution hitherto unstained by a\r\nsingle act of vengeance. This part of his speech was very well worded and\r\nspoken. He objected to the terms in which the passage respecting the\r\nNetherlands was worded, as seeming to cast all the blame upon the Belgians,\r\nand so to make our mediation less effectual. He likewise objected to the\r\nmaking the Portuguese Amnesty a seeming condition of the recognition of\r\nMiguel. Of the recognition itself he did not complain, as he had so long\r\nbeen King _de facto_. These objections were fair.\r\n\r\nLord Farnham having suggested the necessity of preparing for war, Lord Grey\r\nsaid the preparation should be by gaining the hearts of our own people--and\r\nhe advocated, but very temperately, Reform. He did not, however, allow that\r\nthere was any abstract right to a particular mode of constituting a\r\nLegislature. The right of the people was to a _good Government_, and to\r\nwhatever form of Legislative Assembly might seem best to secure that\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nHis speech was good, and temperate, as well as firm. The Duke of Wellington\r\nfollowed him. He declared his intention to oppose Reform. He said we were\r\nnot bound to interfere for the maintenance of the Amnesty further than by\r\nadvice and remonstrance, not by war.\r\n\r\nI should mention that Lord Grey seemed pleased by the abandonment of the\r\ndroits. He was not very well, and at times was almost unable to proceed.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole the tone of the debate was very good, and will do good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 3._\r\n\r\nOffice at eleven to see Col. Houston.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole the debate in the Commons was satisfactory. Peel was very\r\nmuch cheered. O'Connell spoke well, and was heard in perfect silence.\r\nBrougham made an ordinary speech; theme a bad one, violent.\r\n\r\nThere was much row in the streets yesterday; but all occasioned by attacks\r\nupon the police, and attempts to rescue pickpockets. The Guards were called\r\nout rather hastily. Colonel Rowan who commands the police has begged they\r\nmay be left to themselves. They are quite strong enough.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at Lord Rosslyn's. No House of Commons people there. The\r\nPrince of Orange is come. He has written to the King, and is to see him to-\r\nmorrow. It seems there are 7,500 men in the citadel of Antwerp, which can\r\nonly hold 2,000, and has provisions only for two months. The forts of Lillo\r\nand Liefkenshoek are ill-garrisoned; so is Breda, and so is Bergen-op-zoom.\r\nThe Dutch have not 4,000 men in the field near Breda. The question is,\r\nwhether the evacuation of the citadel of Antwerp would not be advisable for\r\nthe purpose of getting out the 7,500 men. It seems that if Flushing be\r\nheld, the Scheld is of no use. The Conference respecting Belgian affairs\r\nmeets to-morrow, Talleyrand being sole representative of France. The first\r\nobject will be to establish an armistice.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we had some conversation respecting the debate in the Commons\r\nof last night. Peel is disgusted at not being supported by the three\r\nCabinet Ministers present, who knew the whole subject which had been so\r\noften discussed in Cabinet--yet not one of them rose to answer Brougham.\r\nThe Duke is very angry with them, and says he shall take an opportunity of\r\nadvising Peel in their presence never to rise till Brougham has spoken, let\r\nothers be abused as they may. If the three mutes will not speak, it is\r\nclear they will not remain in very long.\r\n\r\nI consider a debate to be a battle, in which the chief should be able to\r\nput every man into the fight, as he would every battalion, with a view to\r\nthe ultimate object; he himself being the reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 4._\r\n\r\nIt seems Sir G. Murray did speak last night, but he went further than he\r\nintended on Reform, and so rather damaged our position as a Government.\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Mr. Sullivan. He seems a sensible, liberal man. His evidence\r\nwould be a death-blow to the government of the Company. He says the cotton\r\nof Coimbatore is carried to Tinnevelly and thence to Madras by country\r\nboats, where it is taken up by the China ships. It might be sent directly\r\nto the sea on the Malabar coast, the distance being 300 miles. There is no\r\nobstruction to the cultivation. The country is under a Ryotwar settlement.\r\nThe unequal demand of the Company is very injurious. Their great demand at\r\nsome periods encourages cultivation and raises prices exorbitantly--the\r\nnext year there is no demand at all. They now purchase by contract. The\r\ncontracts are too large for the native merchants, and fall, as jobs, into\r\nthe hands of Europeans. Sufficient notice is not given of the contract. The\r\nnative merchants have from one lac to one and a half.\r\n\r\nGreat injury is sustained by the tobacco monopoly. The Company's officers\r\nsell it as retailers. The Government is, as I always thought, practically\r\nin the hands of the natives. They require European co-operation, but if\r\nthey combine against their European superior he can do nothing. House at\r\nfive. Lord Winchilsea made a violent tirade against the Administration,\r\nwithout any motion before the House. The Duke made a few observations on\r\nthe point of order very quietly, and we rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 5._\r\n\r\nSt. James's at half-past one. The clergy of the Province of Canterbury were\r\nthere, with their address on the accession. They were not expected, and\r\nthere were no gentlemen pensioners. However, they delivered their address\r\nto the King on the throne, and a very good address it was. Peel had to\r\nwrite the answer in a hurry.\r\n\r\nRecorder's report. One man left for execution for a street robbery\r\naccompanied with violence.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder gave but a bad account of the disposition of the City. The\r\nChancellor seems a good deal alarmed, and so does Peel. Every precaution is\r\ntaken, but I cannot help fearing there is a conspiracy of which we know\r\nnothing. Aberdeen suspects connection with France.\r\n\r\nWe are to inquire into the circumstances of the fires in Normandy, which\r\nseem very much to resemble ours. We have had one near Godstone, and another\r\nat Fair-lawn, in Kent; the sufferers unoffending persons. The object seems\r\nto be to spread general terror. It is clear that they are effected by the\r\ndischarge of some chemical preparation, which ignites after a time. No\r\nwatching has any effect. Fires take place where no one has approached.\r\n\r\nGoulburn told me he thought Sir G. Murray had said much more than he\r\nintended, purely from want of habit of speaking; still he had done much\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe new French Ministry is formed, and Lafitte is at its head. He pretends\r\nto have the same views as the late Ministry; but it is impossible to\r\nsuppose the French can resist the offer of Belgium. We shall have no war if\r\nwe can preserve internal peace and the integrity of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 6._\r\n\r\nA letter from Hardinge, who seems to think we stand ill, not for want of\r\nnumbers, but of speakers. Astell told me the Duke's declaration against\r\nReform had injured him in the City.\r\n\r\nSaw Wortley, and had a long conversation with him respecting the state of\r\nthe Government. He thinks we cannot go on. The Duke's declaration against\r\nReform has made it impossible for any to join him, and upon the question of\r\nReform it is doubtful if we should have numbers enough.\r\n\r\nWe talked over possible Governments on the supposition that Lord Grey was\r\nat the head, and that Peel remained in. In walking away I was overtaken in\r\nDowning Street by Lord Graham, who had been waiting to speak to me on the\r\nsame subject. He seems to think our fall not so immediately necessary as\r\nWortley does. I then called on Hardinge, who had been with the Duke this\r\nmorning. Hardinge had candidly told the Duke that if he had a minority on\r\nReform, or a small majority, he would advise him to resign; and previously\r\nto tell the King in what a situation he stood. If he had a good majority he\r\nmight perhaps get some to join; but if not, the position of the Government\r\nwould be as bad in February, or worse, than it was now. The Duke said he\r\nthought things might do still. He had a number of young men who depended\r\nupon him. He would take care to give the King timely notice. The King had\r\nbehaved very well to him. Indeed I know the Duke feels very strongly how\r\nadmirably and how kindly the King has behaved.\r\n\r\nLord Maryborough had been to Hardinge to express his fears for the Duke's\r\nlife, and the Duke has received many letters informing him there is a\r\nconspiracy to assassinate him on Tuesday, as he goes to Guildhall.\r\n\r\nHardinge said every precaution should be taken, but he begged Lord\r\nMaryborough not to tell the Duke his apprehensions. Hardinge, however, has\r\nthe same; and fears there may be an attempt that day to make London a scene\r\nof barricades like Paris and Brussels. Troops will be disposed at intervals\r\nin bodies of half battalions, with provisions, and there will be 1,000\r\ncavalry. Two guns will be ready with the marines at the obelisk, and two in\r\nthe park. Hardinge observed to the Duke that he knew he had bolts inside to\r\nthe doors of the carnage, and added, 'I shall take pocket pistols!' The\r\nDuke said, 'Oh! I shall have pistols in the carriage.' Hardinge asked the\r\nDuke to take him, which he does. Arbuthnot goes with the Duke, too. I wish\r\nI could manage to follow him in my carriage. I shall buy a brace of double-\r\nbarrelled pocket pistols on Monday. Hardinge showed me his.\r\n\r\nThe Duke has made himself very obnoxious by declaring his resolution to\r\noppose Reform, which in fact, however, he did not do in such terms as has\r\nbeen said.\r\n\r\nHardinge told me there was a proposal to Palmerston and others in the\r\nsummer, and they at once started the difficulty of Reform, which put an end\r\nto the negotiation. If I thought Reform would tranquillise the country I\r\nshould be quite satisfied with a change of Ministers which would produce\r\ninternal contentment, but that I do not expect.\r\n\r\nI shall take care to have records in the office to show the line I was\r\nprepared to take on the East Indian Monopoly, and the steps already taken.\r\nI shall likewise leave a memorandum upon the alterations I propose in the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 7, Sunday._\r\n\r\nAll the morning occupied with a letter on the Salt question. At half-past\r\ntwo rode to the Cabinet robin. The Cabinet was to meet at three. We did\r\nnot, however, all assemble till four, the Duke having been with Peel at the\r\nHome Office.\r\n\r\nBefore the Duke came we had all been talking of the Lord Mayor's Day, and\r\nthe manner in which we should go into the City and return, and the\r\nprecautions taken against riot.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Peel came together, and it was evident from the first words\r\nthe Duke spoke that he and Peel had made up their minds to put off the\r\nKing's visit to the City. The Chancellor seemed almost to take fire at the\r\nidea of this, but the Duke very quietly begged him to hear the letters\r\nbefore he decided. The Duke then read various letters he had received, all\r\nwarning him against going, as there was a plot to assassinate him, and\r\nraise a tumult. One of them was from Pearson, a Radical attorney. There was\r\none from a coachmaker, saying he was satisfied, from what his men told him,\r\nthere was such a design, and offering to come with eighteen of his people\r\nand guard the Duke. There was another offer, in a letter not read, to the\r\nsame effect. There was an examination of a man who serves a Radical\r\nprinter, and who formerly lived with Cobbett, which showed the intention to\r\nexist of attacking the Duke. The impression seemed to be general that the\r\nattempt would be made. There was a letter from the Lord Mayor elect\r\n(Alderman Key) to the Duke, telling him there was an intention amongst\r\ndisaffected persons to excite tumult and confusion, and to attack him; that\r\nhe could not be in safety without a guard, and a strong one; and that if an\r\nattack was made _in one quarter_ the civil force would not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said he would not go. Peel, who had received many letters\r\ninforming him of the intention to assassinate him, said if he went he would\r\ngo privately, and come away privately. He observed that if our force, the\r\ndisposition of which was mentioned, and was admirable, succeeded in putting\r\ndown a riot along the line of the procession, he could not answer for the\r\nsecurity of life or property in other parts of the town. We had information\r\nthat the Duke's house would be attacked while he was in the City, and it\r\nwas to be feared that fires might take place to exercise terror and create\r\na diversion.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in the Duke's mind was that we should not be justified in\r\ngiving an occasion for the shedding of blood, by means of a crowd of our\r\nown making. The consequences of the collision would be incalculable, and\r\nmight affect all parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of putting off the King's visit were not lost sight of;\r\nthe effect it would produce on the Funds, and on public confidence--all\r\nthat would be said against the Government as weighing down the King by its\r\nunpopularity.\r\n\r\nThe letter it was proposed to send was written, and the Duke and Peel went\r\nwith it to the King at a little before seven.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone the feeling of the Cabinet underwent a change. Lord\r\nBathurst first observed that it would put an end to the Government, and\r\ncarry Reform. The Chancellor was most unwilling to postpone the King's\r\nvisit. It would be said we did it for our sakes only, and sacrificed him.\r\nLord Bathurst thought the King would take the advice, but be very angry,\r\nand get rid of us.\r\n\r\nThere would be a violent storm in Parliament, and the mobs would come to\r\nour houses. All these feelings rested upon the supposition that the\r\nprocession could return without a tumult, but the letter had been written\r\non the supposition _that it could not_; which was the correct one. The Duke\r\nand Peel came back and told us the King had thought the advice quite right,\r\nand had behaved as well as possible. The tears were in his eyes while the\r\nLord Mayor's letter was read. He said he had already determined in his own\r\nmind to bring the Duke and Peel back in his own carriage. The Duke thought\r\nthe King had rather expected the advice, and that his mind was relieved by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe knew the Queen was much alarmed; but it had been said that the King\r\nwould not hear of there being any danger.\r\n\r\nThe account of the King's manner of receiving the advice seemed to\r\ntranquillise those who had before been dissatisfied with the resolution\r\nwhich had been come to. We then went to the Home Office, where we found\r\nAlderman Thompson, Mr. Oldham (the Chairman of the Entertainment\r\nCommittee), Lord Hill, Lord F. Somerset, Sir W. Gordon, General Macdonald,\r\nand Mr. Phillips. There were two City men I did not know.\r\n\r\nThe Duke told them the course we had determined to adopt. Alderman Thompson\r\nsaid he anticipated the decision--that it could not be announced in more\r\nproper terms. There would be disappointment undoubtedly, but he thought\r\npeople in general would be satisfied with the reasons. He was almost in\r\ntears, and indeed all were much affected--the _cause_ of the measure being\r\nthe apprehended danger to the Duke.\r\n\r\nJust as the letter was going off Alderman Thompson observed that although\r\nhe had no doubt the letter from the Lord Mayor elect was written by his\r\nauthority, as it was in a handwriting in which a letter had been received\r\nfrom him by the Entertainment Committee, yet it was not in the Lord Mayor\r\nelect's handwriting, nor was it dated or signed by him as the other letter\r\nwas. It was immediately determined that it must be ascertained whether the\r\nLord Mayor elect had authorised the sending of the letter before Peel's\r\nletter to the Lord Mayor was delivered.\r\n\r\nMany began to think there was a hoax, and certainly the forgery of one\r\nletter would have thrown suspicion upon all the rest.\r\n\r\nWe were to meet at half-past ten. In going down at half-past ten I called\r\nupon Hardinge, who was in his dressing-gown. His servant gone to bed. He\r\ndid not seem at all surprised.\r\n\r\nWent on to the Cabinet room. Found every word of the letter was in the\r\nLord Mayor elect's own handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips, Sir R. Binnie, and Col. Rowan came in, and Lord F. Somerset,\r\nand Sir W. Gordon. The artillerymen and marines, of whom there were to have\r\nbeen 500, with two guns, at the Obelisk, are not to be moved up. All the\r\nother troops are to remain, and every precaution to be taken, as an attempt\r\nto create disturbance may be expected on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nAfter we had disposed of this matter we spoke a little of Civil List and\r\nRegency. Notice is to be given to-morrow of the two bills, _as if we were\r\nstill a Government_, but I now think nothing but general alarm can enable\r\nus to weather the question of Reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 8._\r\n\r\nThe letter to the Lord Mayor is in the _Times_, and the measure is\r\ntemperately approved of.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the result of the Conference on the affairs of Belgium is\r\nannounced--namely, the declaration that there must be an armistice. This\r\nwill, I trust, give more solid expectations of peace than men have\r\nentertained since the King's Speech. The opening of the West India ports to\r\nAmerican ships is likewise announced. Both the measures are well-timed.\r\n\r\nRode down to the Horse Guards. Overtaken by the Duke, who said he heard\r\nthat people were delighted with the measure of postponing the King's visit\r\nto the City. However, whether they _would say so_ was another thing. He\r\nspoke with much feeling of the King's kindness. He said he had behaved as\r\nwell as possible.\r\n\r\nSome boys hooted, but in general people took off their hats.\r\n\r\nDodd, the coachmaker, told me the people in his neighbourhood were almost\r\nall well-disposed. There were very few Radicals. Colonel Jones had told him\r\nhe could get very few people to attend his meetings, and none who were\r\nrespectable.\r\n\r\nMet Hardinge. He considers it to be the end of the Government. We met Lord\r\nHill, who lamented the measure, but concluded it was necessary. Went to the\r\noffice, where I saw Wortley. He thought it a sad business, and fatal to the\r\nGovernment. He said London had been full of reports yesterday. Wynne was\r\ntalked of for the India Board.\r\n\r\nHardinge's idea (as well as the reports) was that Leach would be\r\nChancellor, and Brougham Master of the Rolls.\r\n\r\nAll the world was much amused by the Chancellor's giving a dinner to Lord\r\nGrey, Brougham, Lord Lansdowne, and others. They themselves must have been\r\nmuch amused, and the Chancellor's not getting to dinner till a quarter past\r\neight, and going away at a quarter-past ten, must have satisfied them that\r\nsomething was in the wind.\r\n\r\nDesired Jones to make out the appointment of Leach's son to a clerkship\r\nimmediately, and signed it in the course of the evening.\r\n\r\nHouse at five. It was very full. Every Whig who is above ground and some\r\nwho are half under it were present. After an hour of talk about everything\r\nbut the only thing men were thinking of, the Duke of Richmond outed with it\r\nin an offensive manner, and he is the last man who should have done so. The\r\nDuke made his explanation very well. Lord Grey afterwards spoke in a very\r\nbad temper, with personal civility, however, to the Duke. The Duke replied,\r\nwhich prevented my speaking at all. Lord Grey had spoken 'of measures\r\ntending to bring this country into the situation in which France was the\r\ntime of the late Revolution;' words which should have been taken up, but\r\nthe Duke's rising after him prevented it.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole I think the measure is considered right, and people are very\r\nglad; indeed, the danger is no longer hanging over their heads. I hear that\r\nin the Commons Peel did admirably, and that he was cheered by the whole\r\nHouse when a Colonel Davies _sneered_ at the letter from the Lord Mayor to\r\nthe Duke. Brougham made as mischievous a speech as he could.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor gave notice of the Regency Bill for Friday.\r\n\r\nI do not think our friends see our danger, and they will never forgive us\r\nif we go out of office without absolute necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 9._\r\n\r\nLooked into the Salt question in the morning. Cabinet at two. There was\r\nlast night a meeting at the Rotunda; about 2,000 people within, and 3,000\r\nor 4,000 without. About half-past ten they dispersed, and from 200 to 600\r\nran down to Westminster, first going to the House, which was up, and then\r\nto Downing Street. The police licked them well, and sent them off. They\r\ncame so quick that a man who headed them, and brought information to the\r\nHome Office, where Peel and the Duke were, could not, by hard running, get\r\nin advance above a minute, and they had passed the Horse Guards before the\r\nDuke, who went there by the back way from the Home Office, had got into the\r\ncourtyard. He was going out at the door when the porter told him the mob\r\nwas passing. One man was taken, in whose pocket was found his will, leaving\r\nhis body to form a rampart against the troops, &c.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to endeavour to induce the mob to disperse as soon as the\r\nRotunda was full, and then to read the Riot Act as soon as the law\r\njustified it, and to disperse them by police. There will be common\r\nconstables there besides. Mr. Chambers will be there; and if he sends for\r\nassistance to the Horse Guards, two bodies of fifty each, each headed by a\r\nmagistrate, will go over Westminster Bridge, one by Stamford Street, the\r\nother by the Blackfriars Road, to the Rotunda.\r\n\r\nThere will be about 300 or 400 new police there. I suggested to Chambers\r\nthe having a boat ready to take a note to the Horse Guards, as his\r\nmessenger might be impeded in the streets. Persons are flocking in from\r\nBrixton and Deptford, and by the Kentish roads.\r\n\r\nMr. Chambers represents the mob as very cowardly.\r\n\r\nThere are two shorthand writers at the Rotunda. The speeches are not very\r\nseditious.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ is turning against us, and I hear the Press is worse than it\r\nwas--none of the newspapers fighting our measure well.\r\n\r\nAfter the Duke was gone there was a little said about Reform. Many\r\ndefections announced--the Staffords, young Hope, Lord Talbot, the Clives\r\nvery unwilling to vote against it, thinking the public feeling so strong. I\r\nsuggested that neither the Duke nor Peel had gone further than to say that\r\nno proposition had yet been made which seemed to them to be safe, and that\r\nwe might perhaps agree to a Committee to inquire into the state of the\r\nRepresentation, and afterwards defeat the specific measures. Peel said he\r\nthought the terms of the motion did not signify. It was 'Reform, or no\r\nReform!' He never would undertake the question of Reform. Lord Bathurst, of\r\ncourse, was against me, and generally they were; but they had, before my\r\nsuggestion, said, 'Had we not better, then, consider what we shall do?'\r\nAfterwards they said nothing.\r\n\r\nPeel and the Duke both think the measure generally approved, and Peel is\r\nsatisfied with the House of Commons. Goulburn, on the other hand, thinks\r\nthe general feeling is against us.\r\n\r\nHouse. Nothing said. There was a crowd at the door, and much hooting. I had\r\nto drive my horse through it. While we were in the House the mob was\r\nremoved by the police. Not knowing this, Clanwilliam and I came home in the\r\nDuke's carriage. There was no mob till we passed Bridge Street, where there\r\nwere a good many people who recognised the carriage, and followed it\r\nhooting. They ran into Downing Street, and we passed on through the Horse\r\nGuards. I was glad to find a Grenadier at the Duke's. Clanwilliam said he\r\nhad ten or twelve there.\r\n\r\nAltered the Bill respecting the fees of officers in the Superior Courts,\r\nand sent it with a letter to Lawford, appointing eleven on Thursday for\r\nseeing him at the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 10._\r\n\r\nOffice. Wrote a placard and showed it to Peel, who will have it printed.\r\nThe tide is turning. Carlisle began to abuse the Duke last night, and found\r\nit would not do. Some cried out, 'He gained the Battle of Waterloo!' and\r\nCarlisle was obliged to begin to praise him. He then tried to abuse the new\r\npolice, but that would not do, and he was obliged to praise them too.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of rioting in different parts of the town. The City\r\nPolice was inefficient, and at Temple Bar rascals were masters for some\r\ntime. The new police, however, gave them a terrible licking opposite\r\nSouthampton Street, and not far from Northumberland House. They got licked,\r\ntoo, in Piccadilly--and the whole was put down by the Civil Power.\r\n\r\nThe military were so arranged that, had they been called for, they would\r\nhave enveloped the rioters. The thing may be considered as nearly put down,\r\nand the Government strengthened by it.\r\n\r\nThe Funds have risen to-day, and are as high as before the postponement of\r\nthe King's visit--indeed higher. So much for Lord Clanricarde's speech.\r\n\r\nCabinet dinner at the Duke's. The King is anxious about the duration of his\r\nGovernment. He would concede on the subject of Reform, although he is\r\nagainst it. Peel told him he thought that by opposing all Reform in the\r\nfirst instance the Government would be able to make better terms\r\nafterwards. The King said either course had its conveniences and\r\ninconveniences. He did not decide between them; but he evidently inclines\r\nto concession.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Queen _now_ declares herself much disappointed at not going to\r\nGuildhall, and the Fitzclarence family are turning against the Government,\r\nwishing, as the Duke says, to be Dukes and Duchesses, which is impossible.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday night 4,000 troops could have been collected in St. James's Park\r\nin ten minutes. There were 2,000 police near Whitehall as a grand reserve.\r\nThe Lord Mayor wrote to Peel acknowledging the total inefficiency of the\r\nCity Police. The contrast between the City and Westminster was most\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe Press is turning against us. Like cats, they are leaving the falling\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons this evening there was an almost unanimous shout\r\nwhen Peel admitted that the new Bishop of Exeter was to hold the living of\r\nStanhope _in commendam_. It seems all unite upon that question, which is an\r\nunlucky one, although the interference of Parliament is quite irregular.\r\n\r\nThere was much talk about the Regency question after dinner, and I left\r\nthem talking still at half-past eleven.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the Chancellor should open the question to the House, and we are\r\nnot prepared, having called Parliament together for this specific purpose!\r\n\r\nWe have neglected the Press too much. The Duke relies upon the support of\r\n'respectable people,' and despises the rabble; but the rabble read\r\nnewspapers, and gradually carry along with them the 'respectable people'\r\nthey outnumber.\r\n\r\nI do not think the being out of office for a Session would be of any\r\nultimate disadvantage to me. I am sure I should enjoy better health, and I\r\nshould have much more to do in the House. I should be enabled to regain my\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 11._\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Wortley. He says the spirits of our friends are improved, and\r\nthose of our foes lowered, the few last days as to Reform. Cabinet at two.\r\nA fire at Melton-Constable. The country round Battle and Hawkhurst almost\r\nin insurrection. Troops sent there The accounts from France good. The\r\nFrench Government acknowledges the right of the Diet to drive the Belgians\r\nout of the Duchy of Luxembourg, which is a part of the German Empire. They\r\nhave instructed Talleyrand to promote the interests of the Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\nRegency Bill. Decided that the Princess Victoria shall be considered Queen,\r\nand the oath of allegiance taken to her with the reservation of the rights\r\nof any child that might be born. If the child should be born, the Queen\r\nDowager to be Regent. During the Princess's minority the Duchess of Kent.\r\n\r\nThe Duke saw the King to-day, and found him very well satisfied with the\r\npostponement of the dinner, and tranquil.\r\n\r\nHouse. The Duke of Buckingham told me they had formed their Government, and\r\nexpected to be in in a week. They think the Duke will resign after Tuesday.\r\nLord Grey to be Foreign Secretary. The Duke of Richmond to be First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury. Palmerston and Grant Secretaries of State. Lansdowne\r\nPresident. The Government to be as Tory as possible. The Chancellor to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nLothian told me all the best old friends of the Government were against\r\nPhilpotts. I told him the reasons why Parliament should not interfere; with\r\nwhich he was satisfied, and was sorry he had not heard them before.\r\n\r\nLord Camden spoke to me on the same subject. I wish we could get rid of\r\nPhilpotts. He will damage us more than Reform.\r\n\r\nThe Funds have risen to 84 3/4; that is, 7 1/2 per cent, in three days. I\r\nbelieve this is the consequence, not only of the broken heads, but of the\r\nidea that the Duke will be firm and not run away.\r\n\r\nWe had a two hours' talk about agriculture; the Duke acquiescing in a\r\nmotion of Salisbury's for a Committee on the Poor Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 12._\r\n\r\nWrote a note to Hardinge, suggesting to him the expediency of calling upon\r\nDr. Philpotts and placing before him the hopelessness of his keeping\r\nStanhope, the damage to himself of a vote of Parliament, and to the Church\r\nfrom the example of Parliamentary interference, leading him to propose the\r\nexchange of Stanhope for a living near Exeter, and I mentioned Dr. Barnes.\r\nIf this could be managed we should turn evil into good, and avoid the\r\ndivision we must lose. The Funds rose to 853/4, and then fell to 84 3/4,\r\nbeing still a rise. In the City they think the Government will stand.\r\n\r\nThere have been threatening notices as near as Colnbrook. In Sussex and\r\nKent things are very bad. I did not, however, see Peel to-day. There was\r\nnothing in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 13._\r\n\r\nIt seems Peel and Scarlet licked Brougham well yesterday. The temper of the\r\nHouse is said to have been rather good. Hardinge told me Goulburn made an\r\nindifferent speech. Philpotts has so good a case that he looks confidently\r\nto the result of the debate. We agreed that there was no reason-why the\r\n_congé d'élire_ should not issue. Philpotts himself decides that it should,\r\nhappen what may as to Stanhope.\r\n\r\nWe had some talk as to the division on the Civil List. Peel is for refusing\r\na Committee, and the separation of the diplomatic expenditure, and will not\r\nyield because he is weak. I think he is right. The better face we put upon\r\nit, the more votes we shall have.\r\n\r\nHardinge suggested the placing of Doherty in Arbuthnot's office. Nothing\r\ncould be better than that arrangement; but he thought, and I think, the\r\nDuke would not displace Arbuthnot. Arbuthnot knows more about my office\r\nthan any one else. Where would they put me?\r\n\r\nWe had some conversation respecting the Regency. It was determined to\r\nlegislate as _little_ as we could.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 14._\r\n\r\nCabinet at four. Peel is of opinion that the fires are in many cases\r\nperpetrated for stock-jobbing purposes. They are certainly done by persons\r\nfrom London.\r\n\r\nHe said he was satisfied that, whatever might be the division on Reform,\r\nthe question was carried. Admiral Sotheron, Lindsay, he thought [blank],\r\nand I think he mentioned another, voted for it. If the county members did,\r\nand it was thrown out by the representatives of Scotch and English\r\nboroughs, it was impossible to stand much longer. He read a paper,\r\ncirculated for signatures in the parish of St. Ann, in which the\r\nsubscribers declare their readiness to be sworn in as special constables,\r\nand their determination to protect property. At the same time they declare\r\ntheir opinion that there ought to be a Reform, first in the House of\r\nCommons; but of Church and State. This he considers the commencement of a\r\nBurgher Guard. I cannot understand his reasoning; if he thinks Reform must\r\nbe carried, surely it is better to vote a general resolution, and to fight\r\nthe details. By objecting to the general resolution we shall probably be\r\nturned out, and have much less power to do good out of office than if we\r\nwere in.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that obstinacy, and the fear of being again accused of\r\nratting, lead to this determination to resist when resistance is, in his\r\nown opinion, fruitless.\r\n\r\nClive, whom I saw to-day, is for a modified Reform; but he will vote for us\r\nin order to keep the Duke in.\r\n\r\nWe had a long conversation about the Regency, and agreed upon the substance\r\nand form of the Bill. Aberdeen wanted again to open the whole question, on\r\nwhich he has no fixed opinion. He has come round entirely. First he thought\r\nthe right was in the presumptive heir; now he thinks it must be in the\r\nchild _in utero_.\r\n\r\nIt appears certain that at Carlisle the 9th was looked to as the day of\r\nsignal to them and to all England. It seems the plan was to attack the\r\nGuildhall and massacre all in it. There would have been a smash, but a most\r\nsignal defeat, for there would have been 250 cavalry, and from 700 to 800\r\nVolunteers there (the East India Volunteers and the Artillery Company),\r\nbesides a battalion within reach.\r\n\r\nSir Claudius Hunter has published in the _Sunday Times_ a denial of the\r\nspeeches attributed to him, and a statement of the City force. Their\r\nordinary force is fifty-four men! With Volunteers, Artillery Company,\r\nPicket men, Firemen, Lumber Troop, &c., they would have had about 2,250.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 15._\r\n\r\nHouse. A very temperate speech of Lord Durham, and a very good one of Lord\r\nSuffield, respecting the new police. Lord Bathurst observed to me they\r\nspoke as if they expected to come in. I mentioned Salisbury's motion for a\r\nCommittee which is to be made on Monday next, and Lord Bathurst said 'Shall\r\nwe be alive then?' He has a serious apprehension of being out.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor made a most excellent speech in moving the first reading of\r\nthe Regency Bill, and was cheered on both sides of the House. It seems as\r\nif the measure would be unanimously approved. Lord Eldon seemed to say he\r\nshould advise the Duke of Cumberland to acquiesce in it.\r\n\r\nThe ultra Tories were to have a meeting to-day--thirty-eight of them--to\r\ndecide what they should do about Reform. Yesterday the report was they\r\njoined us; but the Duke of Richmond will do all he can to make them go\r\nagainst us, and, if they do, I suppose we shall be obliged to make our\r\nbows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 16._\r\n\r\nGoulburn opposed the submitting the Civil List accounts to a Committee, and\r\nwas defeated. We had 204 to 233. Majority against us, 29. Hobhouse asked\r\nPeel whether Ministers would resign, to which he got no answer. Brougham\r\nrose and said Ministers would have time for consideration.\r\n\r\nI suppose this division must be considered to be fatal to us. Henry is\r\ngoing off to take chambers. He means to apply himself to the Law. He is\r\nrather in a hurry. For my own part I am by no means sorry to be out of\r\noffice. I think I shall be better able to regain my proper station in\r\nOpposition than I could have done in office, and the emoluments are of no\r\nvalue to me now.\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Wortley. He is glad that the division against us has been upon\r\nthe Civil List, rather than upon Reform. He thinks we should resign to-day,\r\nand thus throw upon the Whigs the burden of bringing forward Reform as a\r\nGovernment measure. Probably Brougham would postpone his motion if we\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past three I received a note from Sir Robert Taylor desiring\r\nmy immediate attendance at St. James's. I dressed and went, and in a few\r\nmoments was admitted to the King. I met Lord Melville coming away. The King\r\ndesired me to sit down, and asked me whether I had any expectation of the\r\ndivision of last night? I said no--I thought that upon any question\r\nconnected with the Civil List we should have had a majority; that the\r\nquestion itself was one of little importance; but, as the Committee had not\r\nbeen granted before, Sir R. Peel thought it would be a confession of\r\nweakness not to oppose it now, and I thought he was right. The King said it\r\nwas probably chosen as a question merely to try strength.\r\n\r\nThe King asked me what had taken place between the Government and the\r\nCompany. I told his Majesty, and added an outline of the plan I had for the\r\nnew military arrangements, of which he seemed highly to approve. I then\r\nsaid I supposed I must take leave of his Majesty. He said in one sense his\r\nMinisters seemed to think they could not go on.\r\n\r\nI said I could not but express my sentiments, which were I was sure those\r\nof all my colleagues--the sentiments of deep gratitude to his Majesty for\r\nthe constant kind and honourable confidence he had placed in us.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty said he thought it his duty to give the full support of the\r\nCrown to his Ministers. He had confidence in those he found at his\r\nbrother's demise; and since July 26, which was the commencement of our\r\ntroubles, he had regarded with admiration that which was most important in\r\ntheir conduct, their Foreign Policy. He had a feeling of entire\r\nsatisfaction with them.\r\n\r\nI said it must likewise be satisfactory to his Majesty to feel that his\r\nlate Ministers, fully aware of the real difficulties of the country, would\r\nnever be led by any personal or party feelings to do anything which could\r\nbe _prejudicial_ to the country, and that whatever might be their\r\ndifferences in principle from his new Ministers they would ever support his\r\nMajesty's interests.\r\n\r\nThe King was much affected, and had the tears in his eyes all the time I\r\nwas speaking to him. I then rose and kissed his hand, and he shook hands\r\nwith me, and wished me good-bye for the present. I asked for the _entrée_,\r\nwhich he gave me very good-naturedly. As I came away I met Rosslyn going\r\nin. The three Fitzclarences were in the lower room, seemingly enjoying our\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nHouse at five. The Duke had already declared that the occurrence which had\r\ntaken place elsewhere had induced him to think it his duty to tender his\r\nresignation to the King, and his Majesty had been graciously pleased to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nLord Grosvenor asked a question as to the appointment of a successor to Mr.\r\nBuller, and Lord Bathurst said none had been made.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad loss to Wm. Bathurst, who would have been Clerk of the Council\r\nif the Government had lasted three days longer.\r\n\r\nNothing was said. Lord Grey has been sent for by the King.\r\n\r\nI went through all the protocols on the table, and have left hardly\r\nanything but two unanswered letters to my successor--one respecting the\r\nrate of Exchange between territory and commerce; the other respecting\r\nHyderabad affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 19._\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Cabell, Jones, and Leach. They had all the tears in their eyes.\r\nOld Jones could hardly help bursting altogether into tears. Left directions\r\nwith Leach for placing certain papers before my successor, showing the\r\nstate of the finances and expenditure prospectively, and the position in\r\nwhich we were as to the renewal of the Charter.\r\n\r\nCabell will place the Hyderabad papers before my successor, with my letter\r\nto Astell, and his reply.\r\n\r\nCalled on Hardinge, who was not at home.\r\n\r\nI can only leave a memorandum in the office showing the nature and extent\r\nof the military alterations I projected.\r\n\r\nCalled on the Duke. He told me Peel came to him in a very nervous state on\r\nMonday night. Arbuthnot and Goulburn were with him. It was clear that the\r\nmajority would have been against us if there had been a House of 500. The\r\nDuke sent for the Chancellor, who said as soon as he heard of the division\r\nhe thought the game was up--that we could not go on. The Duke went to the\r\nKing in the morning, and told him it was better he should resign\r\nimmediately, and so force the new Government to bring forward their measure\r\nof Reform. It was better for the country. The King asked the Duke's opinion\r\nof Lord Grey, and whether he had ever had any communication with him. The\r\nDuke said No. The King knew the personal objections the late King had to\r\nLord Grey, and he could not, although often pressed by Lord Grey's friends,\r\nhave any communication with him without either deceiving _him_ or deceiving\r\nthe King; and he would not do either. The King asked what sort of a man\r\nLord Grey was? The Duke said he really did not know. He had the reputation\r\nof being an ill-tempered, violent man; but he knew very little of him. He\r\nhad never had any political conversation with him. The King was much\r\nagitated and distressed.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke what passed at my interview with his Majesty yesterday.\r\n\r\nDrummond, Greville, and Sir J. Shelley, whom I saw in the ante-room,\r\ncongratulated me on being out, but condoled on Lord Durham's being removed\r\nout of my way. He goes Minister to Naples _vice_ Lord Burghersh,\r\n_dismissed_. It is understood Brougham will not _positively_ take my\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nLevée. The Duke of Buckingham told me the King was much out of spirits. He\r\nexpressed himself much pleased with his Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe King desired Lord Camden to come and see him frequently--every three or\r\nfour days.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle, Lord Falmouth, Sir E. Knatchbull, Sir R. Vyvyan,\r\nwill not support the new Government. Having had their revenge they mean to\r\nput their knees in our backs and do all they can to get out the others.\r\nThey are sorry for the work they have performed, and regret their vote.\r\nThey had intended to stay away on the question of Reform--now they mean to\r\nvote against it.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey goes to Ireland; a very bad appointment. The Duke of\r\nDevonshire would have been a very unexceptionable one.\r\n\r\nNone of the Whigs or Whig Radicals were at the levée, but a good many\r\nTories. We were there as usual as Ministers, and those who had business\r\nwith the King went in to him as usual.\r\n\r\nI proposed to Herries, Goulburn, Arbuthnot, and others, that we should in\r\neach department prepare a statement of what has been done since the Duke\r\ncame into office. This we shall do to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI likewise proposed we should have a large sheet of paper with columns for\r\nthe new Ministers, and in each column their pledges with the dates.\r\n\r\nCroker has promised to undertake a newspaper, probably the 'Star.'\r\n\r\nArbuthnot told us before dinner that as yet no progress had been made by\r\nLord Grey, except in getting Lord Althorp after much solicitation. Brougham\r\nhas again in the House of Commons to-night declared he has nothing to do\r\nwith the new Government, and will positively bring on his motion on the\r\n25th. The new Government wish to postpone the question till March, when\r\nthey promise to bring in a Bill.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne is said to be much dissatisfied, and the Palmerston party\r\nthink they have not enough offered to them. It is evident that Brougham\r\nprefers power to temporary emolument and distinction, and he will be very\r\ndangerous acting at the head of the Whig Radicals.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said 300 people had called upon him to-day--amongst the rest Lord\r\nCleveland, with whom Lord Grey was early this morning, and whom he in vain\r\nendeavoured to induce to go to Ireland.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bankes, whose father did us most mischief on Monday, and who did\r\nnot vote with us, came to ask the Chancellor for a living to-day!\r\n\r\nLord Grey was much agitated when he was with the King, and has expressed\r\nhimself as very much struck by the strong terms in which the King declared\r\nhis approbation of his late Ministers.\r\n\r\nMy fear is that the Whigs will not be able to form a Government. It is of\r\nmuch importance to the country that their incompetence should be exhibited,\r\nand the fallacy of the grounds upon which they have been attempting to\r\nobtain popular favour. We shall never be strong until it is proved they\r\ncannot form a Government. Again I say my fear is they will be unable to\r\ntake the first step. It was considered that we ought to transact all the\r\nordinary business of our several departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 18._\r\n\r\nCalled on Hardinge. He is out of spirits. Yesterday at the meeting of the\r\n_employés_ Lord G. Somerset asked Peel if he would lead them--to which Peel\r\ngave a damping answer. Hardinge feels that he is capable of business, that\r\nhis circumstances require he should exert himself and be in office; and, as\r\nhe would not take office without the Duke's acquiescence, he thinks it\r\nrather hard he should be deprived of a Parliamentary leader, and thus of\r\nthe means of coming in.\r\n\r\nI told him Peel would be in Opposition in a fortnight, as soon as he\r\nrecovered his health and his spirits. There has been a report that the Duke\r\nhad declared he would not take office again--which is untrue.\r\n\r\nOffice. Saw Jones. Received a letter from the Chairs asking whether I had\r\ngiven Sir J. P. Grant authority to appeal to my sanction for his remaining\r\nin India, notwithstanding the Order in Council for his return. My answer is\r\n_No_. I add that I imagine the misapprehension arose out of some private\r\ncommunications from Sir J. P. Grant's friends, of the purport of a\r\nconversation with me which must have been inaccurately reported to him. I\r\nshowed my draft reply to Lord Rosslyn, and begged him to show it to Grant's\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe report Hardinge gave me was that Lord Wellesley was to succeed me.",
