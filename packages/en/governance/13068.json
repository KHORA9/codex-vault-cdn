To render such readily apparent to the\r\nreader, they have in every case been enclosed in [] brackets.\r\n\r\nA new series of illustrations has been specially prepared for this\r\nedition by Mr. George Darby of Calcutta, and the Publishers venture to\r\nthink he has succeeded in a marked degree in embodying in his sketches\r\nthe spirit of the Author's subjects.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it has been the aim of the Publishers to render this new\r\nedition of a great work by a very gifted writer as perfect as possible\r\nand worthy of acceptance as a standard Anglo-Indian classic.\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    PREFACE\r\n\r\n    I.

You do not see much of him perhaps; but he is a Presence\r\nto be felt, something floating loosely about in wide epicene\r\npantaloons and flying skirts, diffusing as he passes the fragrance of\r\nsmile and pleasantry and cigarette. The air around him is laden with\r\nhoneyed murmurs; gracious whispers play about the twitching bewitching\r\ncorners of his delicious mouth. He calls everything by \"soft names in\r\nmany a mused rhyme.\" Deficits, Public Works, and Cotton Duties are\r\ntransmuted by the alchemy of his gaiety into sunshine and songs. An\r\noffice-box on his writing-table an office-box is to him, and it is\r\nsomething more: it holds cigarettes. No one knows what sweet thoughts\r\nare his as Chloe flutters through the room, blushful and startled, or\r\nas a fresh beaker full of the warm South glows between his amorous eye\r\nand the sun.\r\n\r\n      \"I have never known\r\n      Praise of love or wine\r\n      That panted forth a flood of twaddle so divine.\"\r\n\r\nI never tire of looking at a Viceroy. He is a being so heterogeneous\r\nfrom us! He is the centre of a world with which he has no affinity. He\r\nis a veiled prophet. [He wears many veils indeed.] He who is the axis\r\nof India, the centre round which the Empire rotates, is absolutely and\r\nnecessarily withdrawn from all knowledge of India. He lisps no\r\nsyllable of any Indian tongue; no race or caste, or mode of Indian\r\nlife is known to him; all our delightful provinces of the sun that lie\r\noff the railway are to him an undiscovered country; Ghebers, Moslems,\r\nHindoos blend together in one indistinguishable dark mass before his\r\neye, [in which the cataract of English indifference has not been\r\ncouched; most delightful of all--he knows not the traditions of\r\nAnglo-India, and he does not belong to the Bandicoot Club, St. James's\r\nSquare!]\r\n\r\nA Nawab, whom the Foreign Office once farmed out to me, often used to\r\nask what the use of a Viceroy was. I do not believe that he meant to\r\nbe profane. The question would again and again recur to his mind, and\r\nfind itself on his lips. I always replied with the counter question,\r\n\"What is the use of India?\" He never would see--the Oriental mind does\r\nnot see these things--that the chief end and object of India was the\r\nViceroy; that, in fact, India was the plant and the Viceroy the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nI have often thought of writing a hymn on the Beauty of Viceroys; and\r\nhave repeatedly attuned my mind to the subject; but my inability to\r\nexpress myself in figurative language, and my total ignorance of\r\neverything pertaining to metre, rhythm, and rhyme, make me rather\r\nhesitate to employ verse. Certainly, the subject is inviting, and I am\r\nsurprised that no singer has arisen. How can any one view the\r\nViceroyal halo of scarlet domestics, with all the bravery of coronets,\r\nsupporters, and shields in golden embroidery and lace, without\r\nemotion! How can the tons of gold and silver plate that once belonged\r\nto John Company, Bahadur, and that now repose on the groaning board of\r\nthe Great Ornamental, amid a glory of Himalayan flowers, or blossoms\r\nfrom Eden's fields of asphodel, be reflected upon the eye's retina\r\nwithout producing positive thrills and vibrations of joy (that cannot\r\nbe measured in terms of _ohm_ or _farad_) shooting up and down the\r\nspinal cord and into the most hidden seats of pleasure! I certainly\r\ncan never see the luxurious bloom of the silver sticks arranged in\r\ncareless groups about the vast portals without a feeling approaching\r\nto awe and worship, and a tendency to fling small coin about with a\r\nfine mediæval profusion. I certainly can never drain those profound\r\ngolden cauldrons seething with champagne without a tendency to break\r\ninto loud expressions of the inward music and conviviality that simmer\r\nin my soul. Salutes of cannon, galloping escorts, processions of\r\nlandaus, beautiful teams of English horses, trains of private saloon\r\ncarriages (cooled with water trickling over sweet jungle grasses)\r\nstreaming through the sunny land, expectant crowds of beauty with\r\nhungry eyes making a delirious welcome at every stage, the whole\r\ncountry blooming into dance and banquet and fresh girls at every step\r\ntaken--these form the fair guerdon that stirs my breast at certain\r\nmoments and makes me often resolve, after dinner, \"to scorn delights\r\nand live laborious days,\" and sell my beautiful soul, illuminated with\r\nart and poetry, to the devil of Industry, with reversion to Sir John\r\nStrachey.\r\n\r\nHow mysterious and delicious are the cool penetralia of the Viceregal\r\nOffice! It is the censorium of the Empire; it is the seat of thought;\r\nit is the abode of moral responsibility! What battles, what famines,\r\nwhat excursions of pleasure, what banquets and pageants, what concepts\r\nof change have sprung into life here! Every pigeon-hole contains a\r\npotential revolution; every office-box cradles the embryo of a war or\r\ndearth. What shocks and vibrations, what deadly thrills does this\r\nlittle thunder-cloud office transmit to far-away provinces lying\r\nbeyond rising and setting suns! Ah! Vanity, these are pleasant\r\nlodgings for five years, let who may turn the kaleidoscope after us.\r\n\r\nA little errant knight of the press who has just arrived on the\r\nDelectable Mountains, comes rushing in, looks over my shoulder, and\r\nsays, \"A deuced expensive thing a Viceroy.\" This little errant knight\r\nwould take the thunder at a quarter of the price, and keep the Empire\r\nparalytic with change and fear of change as if the great\r\nThirty-thousand-pounder himself were on Olympus.--ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE A.D.C.-IN-WAITING\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARRANGEMENT IN SCARLET AND GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE A.D.C.-IN WAITING--\"An arrangement in scarlet and\r\ngold.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[August 9, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe tone of the A.D.C. is subdued. He stands in doorways and strokes\r\nhis moustache. He nods sadly to you as you pass. He is preoccupied\r\nwith--himself, [some suppose; others aver his office.] He has a\r\nmotherly whisper for Secretaries and Members of Council. His way with\r\nladies is sisterly--undemonstratively affectionate. He tows up rajas\r\nto H.E., and stands in the offing. His attitude towards rajas is one\r\nof melancholy reserve. He will perform the prescribed observances, if\r\nhe cannot approve of them. Indeed, generally, he disapproves of the\r\nIndian people, though he condones their existence. For a brother in\r\naiguillettes there is a Masonic smile and a half-embarrassed\r\nfamiliarity, as if found out in acting his part. But confidence is\r\nsoon restored with melancholy glances around, and profane persons who\r\nmay be standing about move uneasily away.\r\n\r\nAn A.D.C. should have no tastes. He is merged in \"the house.\" He must\r\ndance and ride admirably; he ought to shoot; he may sing and paint in\r\nwater-colours, or botanise a little, and the faintest aroma of the\r\nmost volatile literature will do him no harm; but he cannot be allowed\r\npreferences. If he has a weakness for very pronounced collars and\r\nshirt-cuffs in mufti, it may be connived at, provided he be honestly\r\nnothing else but the man in collars and cuffs.\r\n\r\nWhen a loud, joyful, and steeplechasing Lord, in the pursuit of\r\npleasure and distant wars, dons the golden cords for a season, the\r\nworld understands that this is masquerading, skittles, and a joke. One\r\nmust not confound the ideal A.D.C. with such a figure.\r\n\r\nThe A.D.C. has four distinct aspects or phases--(1) the full summer\r\nsunshine and bloom of scarlet and gold for Queen's birthdays and high\r\nceremonials; (2) the dark frock-coats and belts in which to canter\r\nbehind his Lord in; (3) the evening tail-coat, turned down with light\r\nblue and adorned with the Imperial arms on gold buttons; (4) and,\r\nfinally, the quiet disguises of private life.\r\n\r\nIt is in the sunshine glare of scarlet and gold that the A.D.C. is\r\nmost awful and unapproachable; it is in this aspect that the splendour\r\nof vice-Imperialism seems to beat upon him most fiercely. The Rajas of\r\nRajputana, the diamonds of Golconda, the gold of the Wynaad, the opium\r\nof Malwa, the cotton of the Berars, and the Stars of India seem to be\r\ntypified in the richness of his attire and the conscious superiority\r\nof his demeanour. Is he not one of the four satellites of that Jupiter\r\nwho swims in the highest azure fields of the highest heavens?\r\n\r\nFrock-coated and belted, he passes into church or elsewhere behind his\r\nLord, like an aërolite from some distant universe, trailing cloudy\r\nvisions of that young lady's Paradise of bright lights and music,\r\nchampagne, mayonnaise, and \"just-one-more-turn,\" which is situated\r\nbehind the flagstaff on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe tail-coat, with gold buttons, velvet cuffs, and light blue silk\r\nlining, is quite a demi-official, small-and-early arrangement. It is\r\ncompatible with a patronising and somewhat superb flirtation in the\r\nverandah; nay, even under the pine-tree beyond the _Gurkha_ sentinel,\r\nwhence many-twinkling Jakko may be admired, it is compatible with a\r\ncertain shadow of human sympathy and weakness. An A.D.C. in tail-coat\r\nand gold buttons is no longer a star; he is only a fire-balloon;\r\nthough he may twinkle in heaven, he can descend to earth. But in the\r\nquiet disguises of private life he is the mere stick of a rocket. He\r\nis quite of the earth. This scheme of clothing is compatible with the\r\ntenderest offices of gaming or love--offices of which there shall be\r\nno recollection on the re-assumption of uniform and on re-apotheosis.\r\nAn A.D.C. in plain clothes has been known to lay the long odds at\r\nwhist, and to qualify, very nearly, for a co-respondentship.\r\n\r\nIn addition to furnishing rooms in his own person, an A.D.C. is\r\nsometimes required to copy my Lord's letters on mail-day, and, in due\r\nsubordination to the Military Secretary, to superintend the stables,\r\nkitchen, or Invitation Department.\r\n\r\nAfter performing these high functions, it is hard if an A.D.C. should\r\never have to revert to the buffooneries of the parade-ground or the\r\nvulgar intimacies of a mess. It is hard that one who has for five\r\nyears been identified with the Empire should ever again come to be\r\nregarded as \"Jones of the 10th,\" and spoken of as \"Punch\" or \"Bobby\"\r\nby old boon companions. How can a man who has been behind the curtain,\r\nand who has seen _la première danseuse_ of the Empire practising her\r\nsteps before the manager Strachey, in familiar chaff and talk with the\r\nCouncil ballet, while the little scene-painter and Press Commissioner\r\nstood aside with cocked ears, and the privileged violoncellist made\r\nhis careless jests--how, I say, can one who has thus been above the\r\nclouds on Olympus ever associate with the gaping, chattering,\r\nirresponsible herd below?\r\n\r\nIt is well that our Ganymede should pass away from heaven into\r\ntemporary eclipse; it is well that before being exposed to the rude\r\ngaze of the world he should moult his rainbow plumage in the Cimmeria\r\nof the Rajas. Here we shall see him again, a blinking _ignis fatuus_\r\nin a dark land--\"so shines a good deed in a naughty world\" thinks the\r\nForeign Office.--ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[August 16, 1879.]\r\n\r\nAt Simla and Calcutta the Government of India always sleeps with a\r\nrevolver under its pillow--that revolver is the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nThere is a tacit understanding that this revolver is not to be let\r\noff; indeed, sometimes it is believed that this revolver is not\r\nloaded.\r\n\r\n[The Commander-in-Chief has a seat in Council; but the Military Member\r\nhas a voice. This division of property is seen everywhere. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief has many offices; in each there is someone other\r\nthan the Commander-in-Chief who discharges all its duties.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Commander-in-Chief command? Armies? No. In India\r\nCommanders-in-Chief command no armies. The Commander-in-Chief only\r\ncommands respect.]\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief is himself an army. His transport, medical\r\nattendance, and provisioning are cared for departmentally, and watched\r\nover by responsible officers. He is a host in himself; and a corps of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nAll the world observes him. His slightest movement creates a molecular\r\ndisturbance in type, and vibrates into newspaper paragraphs.\r\n\r\nWhen Commanders-in-Chief are born the world is unconscious of any\r\nchange. No one knows when a Commander-in-Chief is born. No joyful\r\nfather, no pale mother has ever experienced such an event as the\r\nbirth of a Commander-in-Chief in the family. No Mrs. Gamp has ever\r\nleant over the banister and declared to the expectant father below\r\nthat it was \"a fine healthy Commander-in-Chief.\" Therefore, a\r\nCommander-in-Chief is not like a poet. But when a Commander-in-Chief\r\ndies, the spirit of a thousand Beethovens sob and wail in the air;\r\ndull cannon roar slowly out their heavy grief; silly rifles gibber and\r\nchatter demoniacally over his grave; and a cocked hat, emptier than\r\never, rides with the mockery of despair on his coffin.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening, after tea and catechism, the Supreme Council\r\ngenerally meet for riddles and forfeits in the snug little cloak-room\r\nparlour at Peterhoff. \"Can an army tailor make a Commander-in-Chief?\"\r\nwas once asked. Eight old heads were scratched and searched, but no\r\nanswer was found. No sound was heard save the seething whisper of\r\nchampagne ebbing and flowing in the eight old heads. Outside, the wind\r\nmoaned through the rhododendron trees; within, the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwept peacefully. He felt the awkwardness of the situation. [He thought\r\nof Ali Musjid, and he thought of Isandula; he saw himself reflected in\r\nthe mirror, and he declared that he gave it up.] An aide-de-camp stood\r\nat the door hiccupping idly. He was known to have invested all his\r\npaper currency in Sackville Street; and he felt in honour bound to say\r\nthat the riddle was a little hard on the army tailors. So the subject\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nA Commander-in-Chief is the most beautiful article of social\r\nupholstery in India. He sits in a large chair in the drawing-room.\r\nHeads and bodies sway vertically in passing him. He takes the oldest\r\nwoman in to dinner; he gratifies her with his drowsy cackle. He says\r\n\"Yes\" and \"No\" to everyone with drowsy civility; everyone is\r\nconciliated. His stars dimly twinkle--twinkle; the host and hostess\r\nenjoy their light. After dinner he decants claret into his venerable\r\nperson, and tells an old story; the company smile with innocent joy.\r\nHe rejoins the ladies and leers kindly on a pretty woman; she forgives\r\nherself a month of indiscretions. He touches Lieutenant the Hon.\r\nJupiter Smith on the elbow and inquires after his mother; a noble\r\nfamily is gladdened. He is thus a source of harmless happiness to\r\nhimself and to those around him.\r\n\r\nIf a round of ball cartridge has been wasted by a suicide, or a pair\r\nof ammunition boots carried off by a deserter, the Commander-in-Chief\r\nsometimes visits a great cantonment under a salute of seventeen guns.\r\nThe military then express their joy in their peculiar fashion,\r\naccording to their station in life. The cavalry soldier takes out his\r\ncharger and gallops heedlessly up and down all the roads in the\r\nstation. The sergeants of all arms fume about as if transacting some\r\nimportant business between the barracks and their officers' quarters.\r\nSubalterns hang about the Mess, whacking their legs with small pieces\r\nof cane and drinking pegs with mournful indifference. The Colonel\r\nsends for everyone who has not the privilege of sending for him,\r\nand says nothing to each one, sternly and decisively. The Majors\r\nand the officers doing general duty go to the Club and swear before\r\nthe civilians that they are worked off their legs, complaining\r\nfiercely to themselves that the Service is going, &c. &c. The\r\nDeputy-Assistant-Quartermaster-General puts on all the gold lace he is\r\nallowed to wear, and gallops to the Assistant-Adjutant-General--where\r\nhe has tiffin. The Major-General-Commanding writes notes to all his\r\nfriends, and keeps orderlies flying at random in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief--who had a disturbed night in the train--sleeps\r\npeacefully throughout the day, and leaves under another salute in the\r\nafternoon. He shakes hands with everyone he can see at the station,\r\nand jumps into a long saloon carriage, followed by his staff.\r\n\r\n\"A deuced active old fellow!\" everyone says; and they go home and dine\r\nsolemnly with one another under circumstances of extraordinary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Commander-in-Chief is very remarkable on the poor\r\nIndian, whose untutored mind sees a Lord in everything. He calls the\r\nCommander-in-Chief \"the Jungy Lord,\" or War-Lord, in contradistinction\r\nto the \"Mulky-Lord,\" or Country-Lord, the appellation of the Viceroy.\r\nTo the poor Indian this War-Lord is an object of profound interest and\r\nspeculation. He has many aspects that resemble the other and more\r\nintelligible Lord. An aide-de-camp rides behind him; hats, or hands,\r\nrise electrically as he passes; yet it is felt in secret that he is\r\nnot pregnant with such thunder-clouds of rupees, and that he cannot\r\nmake or mar a Raja. To the Raja it is an ever-recurring question\r\nwhether it is necessary or expedient to salaam to the Jungy Lord and\r\ncall upon him. He is hedged about with servants who will require to be\r\nrichly propitiated before any dusky countryman [of theirs, great or\r\nsmall,] gets access to this Lord of theirs. Is it, then, worth while\r\nto pass through this fire to the possible Moloch who sits beyond? Will\r\nthis process of parting with coin--this Valley of the Shadow of\r\nDeath--lead them to any palpable advantage? Perhaps the War-Lord with\r\nhis red right hand can add guns to their salute; perhaps he will speak\r\na recommendatory word to his caste-fellow, the Country-Lord? These are\r\nprecious possibilities.\r\n\r\nA Raja whom I am now prospecting for the Foreign Office asked me the\r\nother day where Commanders-in-Chief were ripened, seeing that they\r\nwere always so mellow and blooming. I mentioned a few nursery gardens\r\nI knew of in and about Whitehall and Pall Mall. H.H. at once said that\r\nhe would like to plant his son there, if I would water him with\r\nintroductions. This is young 'Arry Bobbery, already favourably known\r\non the Indian Turf as an enterprising and successful defaulter.\r\n\r\nYou will know 'Arry Bobbery, if you meet him, dear Vanity, by the\r\npeculiarly gracious way in which he forgives and forgets should you\r\ncommit the indiscretion of lending him money. You may be sure that he\r\nwill never allude to the matter again, but will rather wear a piquant\r\ndo-it-again manner, like our irresistible little friend, Conny B----.\r\nI don't believe, however, that Bobbery will ever become a\r\nCommander-in-Chief, though his distant cousin, Scindia, is a General,\r\nand though they talk of pawning the 'long-shore Governorship of Bombay\r\nto Sir Cursinjee Damtheboy.--ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE ARCHDEACON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN OF BOTH WORLDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCHDEACON--\"A man of both worlds.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[August 23, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe Press Commissioner has been trying by a strained exercise of his\r\nprerogative to make me spend this day with the Bishop, and not with\r\nthe Archdeacon; but I disregard the Press Commissioner; I make light\r\nof him; I treat his authority as a joke. What authority has a pump? Is\r\na pump an analyst and a coroner?\r\n\r\nWhy should I spend a day with the Bishop? What claim has the Bishop on\r\nmy improving conversation? I am not his sponsor. Besides, he might do\r\nme harm--I am not quite sure of his claret. I admit his superior\r\necclesiastical birth; I recollect his connection with St. Peter; and I\r\nam conscious of the more potent spells and effluences of his\r\nshovel-hat and apron; but I find the atmosphere of his heights cold,\r\nand the rarefied air he breathes does not feed my lungs. Up yonder,\r\nabove the clouds of human weakness, my vertebræ become unhinged, my\r\nbones inarticulate, and I collapse. I meet missionaries, and I hear\r\nthe music of the spheres; and I long to descend again to the circles\r\nof the everyday inferno where my friends are.\r\n\r\n      \"These distant stars I can forego;\r\n      This kind, warm earth, is all I know.\"\r\n\r\nI am sorry for it. I really have upward tendencies; but I have never\r\nbeen able to fix upon a balloon. The High Church balloon always seems\r\nto me too light; and the Low Church balloon too heavy; while no\r\nexperienced aeronaut can tell me where the Broad Church balloon is\r\nbound for; thus, though a feather-weight sinner, here I am upon the\r\nfirm earth. So come along, my dear Archdeacon, let us have a stroll\r\ndown the Mall, and a chat about Temporalities, Fabrics, \"Mean Whites,\"\r\nand little Mrs. Lollipop, \"the joy of wild asses.\"\r\n\r\nAn Archdeacon is one of the busiest men in India--especially when he\r\nis up on the hill among the sweet pine-trees. He is the recognised\r\nguardian of public morality, and the hill captains and the\r\nsemi-detached wives lead him a rare life. There is no junketing at\r\nGoldstein's, no picnic at the waterfalls, no games at Annandale, no\r\nrehearsals at Herr Felix von Battin's, no choir practice at the church\r\neven, from which he can safely absent himself. A word, a kiss, some\r\nmatrimonial charm dissolved--these electric disturbances of society\r\nmust be averted. The Archdeacon is the lightning conductor; where he\r\nis, the leaven of naughtiness passes to the ground, and society is not\r\nshocked.\r\n\r\nIn the Bishop and the ordinary padre we have far-away people of\r\nanother world. They know little of us; we know nothing of them. We\r\nfeel much constraint in their presence. The presence of the\r\necclesiastical sex imposes severe restrictions upon our conversation.\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of the South-Eastern Provinces once complained\r\nto me that the presence of a clergyman rendered nine-tenths of his\r\nvocabulary contraband, and choked up his fountains of anecdote. It\r\nalso restricts us in the selection of our friends. But with an\r\nArchdeacon all this is changed. He is both of Heaven and Earth. When\r\nwe see him in the pulpit we are pleased to think that we are with the\r\nangels; when we meet him in a ball-room we are flattered to feel that\r\nthe angels are with us. When he is with us--though, of course, he is\r\nnot of us--he is yet exceedingly like us. He may seem a little more\r\nvenerable than he is; perhaps there may be about him a grandfatherly\r\nair that his years do not warrant; he may exact a \"Sir\" from us that\r\nis not given to others of his worldly standing; but there is\r\nnevertheless that in his bright and kindly eye--there is that in his\r\nside-long glance--which by a charm of Nature transmutes homage into\r\nfamiliar friendship, and respect into affection.\r\n\r\nThe character of Archdeacons as clergymen I would not venture to touch\r\nupon. It is proverbial that Archidiaconal functions are Eleusinian in\r\ntheir mysteriousness. No one, except an Archdeacon, pretends to know\r\nwhat the duties of an Archdeacon are, so no one can say whether these\r\nduties are performed perfunctorily and inadequately, or scrupulously\r\nand successfully. We know that Archdeacons sometimes preach, and that\r\nis about all we know. I know an Archdeacon in India who can preach a\r\ngood sermon--I have heard him preach it many a time, once on a benefit\r\nnight for the Additional Clergy Society. It wrung four annas from\r\nme--but it was a terrible wrench. I would not go through it again to\r\nhave every living graduate of St. Bees and Durham disgorged on our\r\ncoral strand.\r\n\r\nFrom my saying this do not suppose that I am Mr. Whitley Stokes, or\r\nBabu Keshub Chundra Sen. I am a Churchman, beneath the surface, though\r\na pellicle of inquiry may have supervened. I am not with the party of\r\nthe Bishop, nor yet am I with Sir J.S., or Sir A.C. I abide in the\r\nLimbo of Vanity, as a temporary arrangement, to study the seamy side\r\nof Indian politics and morality, to examine misbegotten wars and\r\nreforms with the scalpel, Stars of India with the spectroscope, and to\r\nenjoy the society of half-a-dozen amusing people to whom the Empire of\r\nIndia is but a wheel of fortune.\r\n\r\nI like the recognised relations between the Archdeacon and women. They\r\nare more than avuncular and less than cousinly; they are tender\r\nwithout being romantic, and confiding without being burdensome. He has\r\nthe private _entrée_ at _chhoti hazri_, or early breakfast; he sees\r\nloose and flowing robes that are only for esoteric disciples; he has\r\nthe private _entrée_ at five o'clock tea and hears plans for the\r\nevening campaign openly discussed. He is quite behind the scenes. He\r\nhears the earliest whispers of engagements and flirtations. He can\r\ngive a stone to the Press Commissioner in the gossip handicap, and win\r\nin a canter. You cannot tell him anything he does not know already.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Government of India has a merrymaking, he is out on the\r\ntrail. At Delhi he was in the thick of the mummery, beaming on\r\nbarbaric princes and paynim princesses, blessing banners, blessing\r\ntrumpeters, blessing proclamations, blessing champagne and truffles,\r\nblessing pretty girls, and blessing the conjunction of planets that\r\nhad placed his lines in such pleasant places. His tight little cob,\r\nhis perfect riding kit, his flowing beard, and his pleasant smile were\r\nthe admiration of all the Begums and Nabobs that had come to the fair.\r\nThe Government of India took such delight in him that they gave him a\r\ngold medal and a book.\r\n\r\nWith the inferior clergy the Archdeacon is not at his ease. He cannot\r\nrespect the little ginger-bread gods of doctrine they make for\r\nthemselves; he cannot worship at their hill altars; their hocus-pocus\r\nand their crystallised phraseology fall dissonantly on his ear; their\r\ntalk of chasubles and stoles, eastern attitude, and all the rest of\r\nit, is to him as a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing. He would\r\nlike to see the clergy merely scholars and men of sense set apart for\r\nthe conduct of divine worship and the encouragement of all good and\r\nkindly offices to their neighbours; he does not wish to see them\r\nmediums and conjurors. He thinks that in a heathen country their\r\npaltry fetishism of misbegotten notions and incomprehensible phrases\r\nis peculiarly offensive and injurious to the interests of civilisation\r\nand Christianity. Of course the Archdeacon may be very much mistaken\r\nin all this; and it is this generous consciousness of fallibility\r\nwhich gives the singular charm to his religious attitude. He can take\r\noff his ecclesiastical spectacles and perceive that he may be in the\r\nwrong like other men.\r\n\r\nLet us take a last look at the Archdeacon, for in the whole range of\r\nprominent Anglo-Indian characters our eye will not rest upon a more\r\norbicular and satisfactory figure.\r\n\r\n      A good Archdeacon, nobly planned\r\n      To warn, to comfort, and command;\r\n      And yet a spirit gay and bright,\r\n      With something of the candle-light.\r\n\r\n                                         ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[August 30, 1879.]\r\n\r\nHe is clever, I am told, and being clever he has to be rather morose\r\nin manner and careless in dress, or people might forget that he was\r\nclever. He has always been clever. He was the clever man of his year.\r\nHe was so clever when he first came out that he could never learn to\r\nride, or speak the language, and had to be translated to the\r\nProvincial Secretariat. But though he could never speak an\r\nintelligible sentence in the language, he had such a practical and\r\nuseful knowledge of it, in half-a-dozen of its dialects, that he could\r\npass examinations in it with the highest credit, netting immense\r\nrewards. He thus became not only more and more clever, but more and\r\nmore solvent; until he was an object of wonder to his contemporaries,\r\nof admiration to the Lieutenant-Governor, and of desire to several\r\n_Burra Mem Sahibs_[A] with daughters. It was about this time that he\r\nis supposed to have written an article published in some English\r\nperiodical. It was said to be an article of a solemn description, and\r\nreport magnified the periodical into the _Quarterly Review_. So he\r\nbecame one who wrote for the English Press. It was felt that he was a\r\nman of letters; it was assumed that he was on terms of familiar\r\ncorrespondence with all the chief literary men of the day. With so\r\nconspicuous a reputation, he believed it necessary to do something in\r\nreligion. So he gave up religion, and allowed it to be understood that\r\nhe was a man of advanced views: a Positivist, a Buddhist, or something\r\nequally occult. Thus he became ripe for the highest employment, and\r\nwas placed successively on a number of Special Commissions. He\r\ninquired into everything; he wrote hundredweights of reports; he\r\nproved himself to have the true paralytic ink flux, precisely the kind\r\nof wordy discharge or brain hæmorrhage required of a high official in\r\nIndia. He would write ten pages where a clod-hopping collector would\r\nwrite a sentence. He could say the same thing over and over again in a\r\nhundred different ways. The feeble forms of official satire were at\r\nhis command. [He could bray ironically at subordinate officers. He had\r\nthe inborn arrogance required for official \"snubbing.\" Being without a\r\nray of good feeling or modesty, he could allow himself to write with\r\nceremonial rudeness of men who in his inmost heart he knew to be in\r\nevery way his superiors.] He desired exceedingly to be thought\r\nsupercilious, and he thus became almost necessary to the Government of\r\nIndia, was canonised, and caught up to Simla. The Indian papers\r\nchanted little anthems, \"the Services\" said \"Amen,\" and the apotheosis\r\nwas felt to be a success. On reaching Simla he was found to be\r\nfamiliar with the two local \"jokes,\" planted many years ago by some\r\njackass. One of these \"jokes\" is about everything in India having its\r\npeculiar smell, except a flower; the second is some inanity about the\r\nIndian Government being a despotism of despatch-boxes tempered by the\r\nloss of the keys. He often emitted these mournful \"jokes\" until he was\r\ndeclared to be an acquisition to Simla society.\r\n\r\nSuch is the man I am with to-day. His house is beautifully situated,\r\noverlooking a deep ravine, full of noble pine-trees, and surrounded by\r\nrhododendrons. The verandah is gay with geraniums and tall servants in\r\nImperial red deeply encrusted with gold. Within, all is very\r\nrespectable and nice, only the man is--not exactly vile, but certainly\r\nimperfect in a somewhat conspicuous degree. With the more attractive\r\nforms of sin he has no true sympathy. I can strike no concord with him\r\non this umbrageous side of nature. I am seriously shocked to discover\r\nthis, for he affects infirmity; but his humanity is weak. In his\r\ncharacter I perceive the perfect animal outline, but the colour is\r\nwanting; the glorious sunshine, the profound glooms of humanity are\r\nnot there.\r\n\r\nSuch a man is dangerous; he decoys you into confidences. Even Satan\r\ncannot respect a sinner of this complexion,--a sinner who is only\r\nfascinated by the sinfulness of sin. As for my poor host, I can see\r\nthat he has never really graduated in sin at all; he has only sought\r\nthe degree of sinner _honoris causa_. I am sure that he never had\r\nenough true vitality or enterprise to sin as a man ought to sin, if he\r\ndoes sin. [Of course a man ought not to sin; and the nobler sort try\r\nto reduce their sinning to a minimum; but when they do sin I hold that\r\nthey sin like men. (I have heard it said that a man should sin like a\r\ngentleman; but I am much disposed to think that the gentleman nature\r\nappears in the non-sinning lucid intervals.)] When I speak of sin I\r\nwill be understood to mean the venial offences of prevarication and\r\nsleeping in church. I am not thinking of sheep-stealing or highway\r\nrobbery. My clever friend's work consists chiefly in reducing files of\r\ncorrespondence on a particular subject to one or two leading thoughts.\r\nUpon these he casts the colour of his own opinions, and submits the\r\nsubjective product to the Secretary or Member of Council above him for\r\nfinal orders. His mind is one of the many dense and refractive mediums\r\nthrough which the Government of India looks out upon India.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time he is called upon to write a minute or a note on\r\nsome given subject, and then it is that his thoughts and words expand\r\nfreely. He feels bound to cover an area of paper proportionate to his\r\nown opinion, of his own importance; he feels bound to introduce a\r\ncertain seasoning of foreign words and phrases; and he feels bound to\r\ncreate, if the occasion seems in any degree to warrant it, one of\r\nthose cock-eyed, limping, stammering epigrams which belong exclusively\r\nto the official humour of Simla. [In writing thus, the figure of\r\nanother Secretariat official rises before me with reproachful looks. I\r\nsee the thought-worn face of that Secretary to whom the Rajas belong,\r\nand who is, in every particular, a striking contrast with the typical\r\nperson whose portrait I sketch. The Secretary in the Foreign\r\nDepartment is a scholar and a man of letters by instinct. Whatever he\r\nwrites is something more than correct and precise--it is impressed\r\nwith the sweep and cadence of the sea; it is rhythmical, it is\r\nsonorous.]\r\n\r\n[But let us return to the prisoner in the dock] I have said that the\r\nSecretary is clever, scornful, jocose, imperfectly sinful, and nimble\r\nwith his pen. I shall only add that he has succeeded in catching the\r\ntone of the Imperial Bumbledom; and then I shall have finished my\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThis tone is an affectation of æsthetic and literary sympathies,\r\ncombined with a proud disdain of everything Indian and Anglo-Indian.\r\n\r\nThe flotsam and jetsam of advanced European thought are eagerly sought\r\nand treasured up. \"The New Republic\" and \"The Epic of Hades\" are on\r\nevery drawing-room table. One must speak of nothing but the latest\r\ndoings at the Gaiety, the pictures of the last Academy, the ripest\r\noutcome of scepticism in the _Nineteenth Century_, or the aftermath in\r\nthe _Fortnightly_. If I were to talk to our Secretariat man about the\r\nharvest prospects of the Deckan, the beauty of the Himalayan scenery,\r\nor the book I have just published in Calcutta about the Rent Law, he\r\nwould stare at me with feigned surprise and horror.\r\n\r\n      \"When he thinks of his own native land,\r\n        In a moment he seems to be there;\r\n      But, alas! Ali Baba at hand\r\n        Soon hurries him back to despair.\"\r\n\r\n                                             ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.E. THE BENGALI BABOO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BENGALI BABOO--\"Full of inappropriate words and\r\nphrases.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[September 13, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe ascidian[B] that got itself evolved into Bengali Baboos must have\r\nseized the first moment of consciousness and thought to regret the\r\nstep it had taken; for however much we may desire to diffuse Babooism\r\nover the Empire, we must all agree that the Baboo itself is a subject\r\nfor tears.\r\n\r\nThe other day, as I was strolling down the Mall, whistling Beethoven's\r\n9th Symphony, I met the Bengali Baboo. It was returning from office. I\r\nasked it if it had a soul. It replied that it had not, but some day it\r\nhoped to pass the matriculation examination of the Calcutta\r\nUniversity. I whistled the opening bars of one of Cherubini's\r\nRequiems, but I saw no resurrection in its eye, so I passed on.\r\n\r\n[I have just procured an adult specimen of the Bengali Baboo (it was\r\noriginally the editor of the _Calcutta Moonshine_), and I have engaged\r\nan embryologist, on board wages, to examine and report upon it.\r\n\r\nI once found George Bassoon weeping profusely over a dish of\r\nartichokes. I was a little surprised, for there was a bottle close at\r\nhand and he had a book in his hand. I took the book. It was not\r\nBoccaccio; it was not Rabelais; it was not even Swinburne. I felt that\r\nsomething must be wrong. I turned to the title-page. I found it was a\r\npoem printed for private circulation by the _Government of India_. It\r\nwas called \"The Anthropomorphous Baboo subtilised into Man.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Lhassa the Dalai Lama told me that a virtuous\r\ncow-hippopotamus by metempsychosis might, under unfavourable\r\ncircumstances, become an undergraduate of the Calcutta University, and\r\nthat, when patent-leather shoes and English supervened, the thing was\r\na Baboo. [This sounds very plausible; but how about the prehensile\r\ntail which the Education Department finds so much in the way of\r\nimprovement, which indeed is said to preclude all access to the\r\nBengali mind, and which can grasp everything but an idea, even an\r\ninquisitorial schoolmaster? \"Hereby hangs a tail\" is a motto in which\r\nEdward Gibbon had no monopoly.]\r\n\r\nI forget whether it was the Duke of Buckingham, or Mr. Lethbridge, or\r\nGeneral Scindia--I always mix up these C.I.E.'s together in my mind\r\nsomehow--who told me that a Bengali Baboo had never been known to\r\nlaugh, but only to giggle with clicking noises like a crocodile. Now\r\nthis is very telling evidence, because if a Baboo does not laugh at a\r\nC.I.E. he will laugh at nothing. The faculty must be wanting.\r\n\r\n[The Raja of Fattehpur, Member of the Legislative Council, and\r\ncommonly known as \"Joe Hookham,\" says that fossil Baboos have been\r\nfound in Orissa with the cuckoo-bone, everything that a schoolmaster\r\ncould wish. Now \"Joe\" is a palæontologist not to be sneezed at. This\r\nconfirms the opinion of General Cunningham that the mounted figure in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Lahore represents a Bengali washerwoman riding to\r\nthe _Ghât_ to perform a lustration. Because unless the _os coccyx_\r\nwere all right it would be as difficult to ride a bullock as to get\r\neducated by the usual process.]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Macaulay said that what the milk was to the cocoanut, what\r\nbeauty was to the buffalo, and what scandal was to woman, that Dr.\r\nJohnson's Dictionary was to the Bengali Baboo, he unquestionably spoke\r\nin terms of figurative exaggeration; nevertheless, a core of truth\r\nlies hidden in his remark. It is by the Baboo's words you know the\r\nBaboo. The true Baboo is full of words and phrases--full of\r\ninappropriate words and phrases lying about like dead men on a\r\nbattlefield, in heaps to be carted away promiscuously, without\r\nreference to kith or kin. You may turn on a Baboo at any moment and be\r\nquite sure that words, and phrases, and maxims, and proverbs will come\r\ngurgling forth, without reference to the subject or to the occasion,\r\nto what has gone before or to what will come after. Perhaps it was\r\nwith reference to this independence, buoyancy, and gaiety of language\r\nthat Lord Lytton declared the Bengali to be \"the Irishman of India.\"\r\n\r\nYou know, dear Vanity, I whispered to you before that the poor Baboo\r\noften suffers from a slight aberration of speech which prevents his\r\narticulating the truth--a kind of moral lisp. Lord Lytton could not\r\nhave been alluding to this; for it was only yesterday that I heard an\r\nIrishman speak the truth to Lord Lytton about some little matter--I\r\nforget what; cotton duty, I think--and Lord Lytton said, rather\r\ncurtly, \"Why, you have often told me this before.\" So Lord Lytton must\r\nbe in the habit of hearing certain truths from the Irish.\r\n\r\nIt was either Sir Andrew Clarke, Sir Alexander Arbuthnot, or Sir\r\nSome-one-else, who understands all about these things, that first told\r\nme of the tendency to Baboo worship in England at present. I\r\nimmediately took steps, when I heard of it, to capitalise my pension\r\nand purchase gold mines in the Wynaad and shares in the Simla Bank.\r\n(Colonel Peterson, of the Simla Fencibles, supported me gallantly in\r\nthis latter resolution.) The notion of so dreadful a form of fetishism\r\nestablishing itself in one's native land is repugnant to the feelings\r\neven of those who have been rendered callous to such things by seats\r\nin the Bengal Legislative Council. [I refuse to believe that the\r\nZoological Society has lent its apiary to this movement. It must have\r\nbeen a spelling-bee your informant was thinking of.\r\n\r\nTalking of monkey-houses reminds me of] Sir George Campbell, who took\r\nsuch an interest in the development of the Baboo, and the selection of\r\nthe fittest for Government employment. He taught them in\r\ndebating-clubs the various modes of conducting irresponsible\r\nparliamentary chatter; and he tried to encourage pedestrianism and\r\nfootball to evolve their legs and bring them into something like\r\nharmony with their long pendant arms. You can still see a few of Sir\r\nGeorge's leggy Baboos coiled up in corners of lecture-rooms at\r\nCalcutta. The Calcutta Cricket Club used to employ one as permanent\r\n\"leg.\" [The Indian Turf Club used to keep a professional \"leg,\" but\r\nnow there are so many amateurs it is not required.]\r\n\r\nIt is the future of Baboodom I tremble for. When they wax fat with new\r\nreligions, music, painting, Comédie Anglaise, scientific discoveries,\r\nthey may kick with those developed legs of theirs, until we shall have\r\nto think that they are something more than a joke, more than a mere\r\n_lusus naturæ_, more than a caricature moulded by the accretive and\r\ndifferentiating impulses of the monad[C] in a moment of wanton\r\nplayfulness. The fear is that their tendencies may infect others. The\r\npatent-leather shoes, the silk umbrellas, the ten thousand horse-power\r\nEnglish words and phrases, and the loose shadows of English thought,\r\nwhich are now so many Aunt Sallies for all the world to fling a jeer\r\nat, might among other races pass into _dummy soldiers_, and from dummy\r\nsoldiers into trampling, hope-bestirred crowds, and so on, out of the\r\nprovince of Ali Baba and into the columns of serious reflection. Mr.\r\nWordsworth and his friends the Dakhani Brahmans should consider how\r\npainful it would be, when deprived of the consolations of religion, to\r\nbe solemnly repressed by the _Pioneer_--to be placed under that\r\nsteam-hammer which by the descent of a paragraph can equally crack the\r\ntiniest of jokes and the hardest of political nuts, can suppress\r\nunauthorised inquiry and crush disaffection.\r\n\r\nAt present the Baboo is merely a grotesque Bracken shadow, but in the\r\ncourse of geological ages it might harden down into something\r\npalpable. It is this possibility that leads Sir Ashley Eden to advise\r\nthe Baboo to revert to its original type; but it is not so easy to\r\nbecome homogeneous after you have been diluted with the physical\r\nsciences and stirred about by Positivists and missionaries. \"I would I\r\nwere a protoplastic monad!\" may sound very rhythmical, poetical, and\r\nall that; but even for a Baboo the aspiration is not an easy one to\r\ngratify.--ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE RAJA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[September 20, 1879.]\r\n\r\nTry not to laugh, Dear Vanity. I know you don't mean anything by it;\r\nbut these Indian kings are so sensitive. The other day I was\r\ntranslating to a young Raja what Val Prinsep had said about him in his\r\n\"Purple India\"; he had only said that he was a dissipated young ass\r\nand as ugly as a baboon; but the boy was quite hurt and began to cry,\r\nand I had to send for the Political Agent to quiet him and put him to\r\nsleep. When you consider the matter philosophically there is nothing\r\n_per se_ ridiculous in a Raja. Take a hypothetical case: picture to\r\nyourself a Raja who does not get drunk without some good reason, who\r\nis not ostentatiously unfaithful to his five-and-twenty queens and his\r\nfive-and-twenty grand duchesses, who does not festoon his thorax and\r\nabdomen with curious cutlery and jewels, who does not paint his face\r\nwith red ochre, and who sometimes takes a sidelong glance at his\r\naffairs, and there is no reason why you should not think of such a one\r\nas an Indian king. India is not very fastidious; so long as the\r\nGovernment is satisfied, the people of India do not much care what the\r\nRajas are like. A peasant proprietor said to Mr. Caird and me the\r\nother day, \"We are poor cultivators; we cannot afford to keep Rajas.\r\nThe Rajas are for the Lord Sahib.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Maharaja of Kuch Parwani assures me that it is not\r\nconsidered the thing for a Raja at the present day to govern. \"A\r\nreally swell Raja amuses himself.\" One hoards money, another plays at\r\nsoldiering, a third is horsey, a fourth is amorous, and a fifth gets\r\ndrunk; at least so Kuch Parwani thinks. Please don't say that I told\r\nyou this. The Foreign Secretary knows what a high opinion I have of\r\nthe Rajas, and indeed he often employs me to whitewash them when they\r\nget into scrapes. \"A little playful, perhaps, but no more loyal Prince\r\nin India!\" This is the kind of thing I put into the Annual\r\nAdministration Reports of the Agencies, and I stick to it. Playful no\r\ndoubt, but a more loyal class than the Rajas there is not in India.\r\nThey have built their houses of cards on the thin crust of British\r\nRule that now covers the crater, and they are ever ready to pour a\r\npannikin of water into a crack to quench the explosive forces rumbling\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe amiable chief in whose house I am staying to-day is exceedingly\r\nsimple in his habits. At an early hour he issues from the zenana and\r\njoins two or three of his thakores, or barons, who are on duty at\r\nCourt, in the morning draught of opium. They sit in a circle, and a\r\nservant in the centre goes round and pours the _kasumbha_[D] out of a\r\nbrass bowl and through a woollen cloth into their hands, out of which\r\nthey lap it up. Then a cardamum to take away the acrid after-taste.\r\nOne hums drowsily two or three bars of an old-world song; another\r\nclears his throat and spits; the Chief yawns, and all snap their\r\nfingers, to prevent evil spirits skipping into his throat; a late\r\nriser joins the circle, and all, except the Chief, give him\r\n_tazim_--that is, rise and salaam; a coarse jest or two, and the party\r\ndisperses. A crowd of servants swarm round the Chief as he shuffles\r\nslowly away. Three or four mace-bearers walk in front shouting, \"Raja,\r\nMaharaja salaamat ho; niga rakhiyo!\" (\"Please take notice; to the\r\nKing, the great King, let there be salutation!\") A confidential\r\nservant continually leans forward and whispers in his ear; another\r\nremains close at hand with a silver tea-pot containing water and\r\nwrapped up in a wet cloth to keep it cool; a third constantly whisks a\r\nyak's tail over the King's head; a fourth carries my Lord's sword; a\r\nfifth his handkerchief; and so on. Where is he going? He dawdles up a\r\nnarrow staircase, through a dark corridor, down half-a-dozen steep\r\nsteps, across a courtyard overgrown with weeds, up another staircase,\r\nalong another passage, and so to a range of heavy quilted red screens\r\nthat conceal doors leading into the female penetralia. Here we must\r\nleave him. Two servants disappear behind the _parda_ with their\r\nmaster, the others promptly lie down where they are, draw the sheets\r\nor blankets which they have been wearing over their faces and feet,\r\nand sleep. About noon we see the King again. He is dressed in white\r\nflowing robes with a heavy carcanet of emeralds round his neck. His\r\nred turban is tied with strings of seed pearls and set off with an\r\naigrette springing from a diamond brooch. He sits on the Royal\r\nmattress, the _gaddi_.[E] A big bolster covered with green velvet\r\nsupports his back; his sword and shield are gracefully disposed before\r\nhim. At the corner of the _gaddi_ sits a little representation of\r\nhimself in miniature, complete even to the sword and shield. This is\r\nhis adopted son and heir. For all the queens and all the grand\r\nduchesses are childless, and a little kinsman had to be transplanted\r\nfrom a mud village among the cornfields to this dreamland palace to\r\nperpetuate the line. On the corners of the carpet on which the _gaddi_\r\nrests sit thakores of the Royal house, other thakores sit below, right\r\nand left, forming two parallel lines, dwindling into sardars, palace\r\nofficers, and others of lower rank as they recede from the _gaddi_.\r\nBehind the Chief stand the servants with the emblems of royalty--the\r\npeacock feathers, the fan, the yak tail, and the umbrella (now\r\nfurled). The confidential servant is still whispering into the ear of\r\nhis master from time to time. This is durbar. No one speaks, unless to\r\nexchange a languid compliment with the Chief. Presently essence of\r\nroses and a compound of areca nut and lime are circulated, then a huge\r\nsilver pipe is brought in, the Chief takes three long pulls, the\r\nthakores on the carpet each take a pull, and the levée breaks up amid\r\nprofound salaams. After this--dinner, opium, and sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the cool of the evening our King emerges from the palace, and,\r\nriding on a prodigiously fat white horse with pink points, proceeds to\r\nthe place of carousal. A long train of horsemen follow him, and\r\nfootmen run before with guns in red flannel covers and silver maces,\r\nshouting \"Raja Maharaja salaamat,\" &c. The horsemen immediately around\r\nhim are mounted on well-fed and richly-caparisoned steeds, with all\r\nthe bravery of cloth-of-gold, yak-tails, silver chains, and strings of\r\nshells; behind are troopers in a burlesque of English uniform; and\r\naltogether in the rear is a mob of caitiffs on skeleton chargers,\r\nmasquerading in every degree of shabbiness and rags, down to nakedness\r\nand a sword. The cavalcade passes through the city. The inhabitants\r\npour out of every door and bend to the ground. Red cloths and white\r\nveils flutter at the casements overhead. You would hardly think that\r\nthe spectacle was one daily enjoyed by the city. There is all the\r\nhurrying and eagerness of novelty and curiosity. Here and there a\r\nlittle shy crowd of women gather at a door and salute the Chief with a\r\nloud shrill verse of discordant song. It is some national song of the\r\nChiefs ancestors and of the old heroic days. The place of carousal is\r\na bare spot near a large and ancient well out of which grows a vast\r\npipal tree. Hard by is a little temple surmounted by a red flag on a\r\ndrooping bamboo. It is here that the _Gangôr_[F] and _Dassahra_[F]\r\nsolemnities are celebrated. Arrived on the ground, the Raja slowly\r\ncircles his horse; then, jerking the thorn-bit, causes him to advance\r\nplunging and rearing, but dropping first on the near foot and then on\r\nthe off foot with admirable precision; and finally, making the white\r\nmonster, now in a lather of sweat, rise up and walk a few steps on his\r\nhind legs, the Raja's performance concludes amid many shouts of wonder\r\nand delight from the smooth-tongued courtiers. The thakores and\r\nsardars now exhibit their skill in the _manége_ until the shades of\r\nnight fall, when torches are brought, amid much salaaming, and the\r\ncavalcade defiles, through the city, back to the palace. Lights are\r\ntwinkling from the higher casements and reflected on the lake below;\r\nthe _gola_[G] slave-girls are singing plaintive songs, drum and conch\r\nanswer from the open courtyards. The palace is awake. The Raja, we\r\nwill romantically presume, bounds lightly from his horse and dances\r\ngaily to the harem to fling himself voluptuously into the luxurious\r\narms of one of the five-and-twenty queens, or one of the\r\nfive-and-twenty grand duchesses; and they stand for one delirious\r\nmoment wreathed in each other's embraces--\r\n\r\n        While soft there breathes\r\n      Through the cool casement, mingled with the sighs\r\n      Of moonlight flowers, music that seems to rise\r\n      From some still lake, so liquidly it rose,\r\n      And, as it swell'd again at each faint close,\r\n      The ear could track through all that maze of chords\r\n      And young sweet voices these impassioned words--\r\n\r\n\"Ho, you there! fetch us a pint of gin! and look sharp, will you!\"\r\n\r\n      For who, in time, knows whither we may vent\r\n      The treasure of our tongue, to what strange shores\r\n      This gain of our best glory shall be sent,\r\n      To enrich unknowing nations with our stores!\r\n      What worlds in the yet unformèd Orient\r\n      May come refined with accents that are ours!\r\n\r\nBut, dear Vanity, I can see that you are impatient of scenes whose\r\nluxuries steal, spite of yourself, too deep into your soul; besides, I\r\ndread the effect of such warm situations on a certain Zuleika to whom\r\nthe note of Ali Baba is like the thrice-distilled strains of the\r\nbulbul on Bendemeer's stream. So let us electrify ourselves back to\r\nprose and propriety by thinking of the Political Agent; let us plunge\r\ninto the cold waters of dreary reality by conjuring up a figure in\r\ntail-coat and gold buttons dispensing justice while H.H. the romantic\r\nand picturesque Raja, G.C.S.I., amuses himself. Yet we hear cries from\r\nthe gallery of \"Vive M. le Raja; vive la bagatelle!\"\r\n\r\nSo say we, in faint echoes, defying the anathemas of the Foreign\r\nOffice. Do not turn this beautiful temple of ancient days into a mere\r\nmill for decrees and budgets; but sweep it and purify it, and render\r\nit a fitting shrine for the homage and tribute of antique\r\nloyalty--\"that proud submission, that subordination of the heart which\r\nkept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted\r\nfreedom.\" With tail-coat and cocked-hat government \"the unbought grace\r\nof life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment\r\nand heroic enterprise is gone.\"--ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE POLITICAL AGENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN IN BUCKRAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLITICAL AGENT--\"A man in buckram.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[September 27, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThis is a most curious product of the Indian bureaucracy. Nothing in\r\nall White Baboodom is so wonderful as the Political Agent. A near\r\nrelation of the Empress who was travelling a good deal about India\r\nsome three or four years ago said that he would rather get a Political\r\nAgent, with raja, chuprassies,[H] and everything complete, to take\r\nhome, than the unfigured \"mum\" of Beluchistan, or the sea-aye-ee\r\nmocking bird, _Kokiolliensis Lyttonia_. But the Political Agent cannot\r\nbe taken home. The purple bloom fades in the scornful climate of\r\nEngland; the paralytic swagger passes into sheer imbecility; the\r\nthirteen-gun tall talk reverberates in jeering echoes; the chuprassies\r\nare only so many black men, and the raja is felt to be a joke. The\r\nPolitical Agent cannot live beyond Aden.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India keeps its Political Agents scattered over the\r\nnative states in small jungle stations. It furnishes them with\r\nmaharajas, nawabs, rajas, and chuprassies, according to their rank,\r\nand it usually throws in a house, a gaol, a doctor, a volume of\r\nAitchison's Treaties, an escort of native Cavalry, a Star of India,\r\nan assistant, the powers of a first-class magistrate, a flag-staff,\r\nsix camels, three tents, and a salute of eleven or thirteen\r\nguns. In very many cases the Government of India nominates\r\na Political Agent to the rank of Son-to-a-Lieut.-Governor,\r\nSon-in-Law-to-a-Lieut.-Governor, Son-to-a-member-of-Council, or\r\nSon-to-an-agent-to-the-Governor-General. Those who are thus elevated\r\nto the Anglo-Indian peerage need have no thought for the morrow what\r\nthey shall do, what they shall say, or wherewithal they shall be\r\nsupplied with a knowledge of Oriental language and occidental law.\r\nNature clothes them with increasing quantities of gold lace and starry\r\nornaments, and that charming, if unblushing, female--Lord Lytton begs\r\nme to write \"maid\"--Miss Anglo-Indian Promotion, goes skipping about\r\namong them like a joyful kangaroo.\r\n\r\nThe Politicals are a Greek chorus in our popular burlesque, \"Empire.\"\r\nThe Foreign Secretary is the prompter. The company is composed of\r\nnawabs and rajas (with the Duke of Buckingham as a \"super\"). Lord\r\nMeredith is the scene-shifter; Sir John, the manager. The Secretary of\r\nState, with his council, is in the stage-box; the House of Commons in\r\nthe stalls; the London Press in the gallery; the East Indian\r\nAssociation, Exeter Hall, Professor Fawcett, Mr. Hyndman, and the\r\ncriminal classes generally, in the pit; while those naughty little\r\nScotch boys, the shock-headed Duke and Monty Duff, who once tried to\r\nturn down the lights, pervade the house with a policeman on their\r\nhorizon. As we enter the theatre a dozen chiefs are dancing in the\r\nballet to express their joy at the termination of the Afghan War. The\r\npolitical _choreutæ_ are clapping their hands, encouraging them by\r\nname and pointing them out to the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe government of a native state by clerks and chuprassies, with a\r\nbeautiful _fainéant_ Political Agent for Sundays and Hindu festivals,\r\nis, I am told, a thing of the past. Colonel Henderson, the imperial\r\n\"Peeler,\" tells me so, and he ought to know, for he is a kind of\r\ndemi-official superintendent of Thugs and Agents. Nowadays, my\r\ninformant assures me, the Political Agents undergo a regular training\r\nin a Madras Cavalry Regiment or in the Central India Horse, or on the\r\nViceroy's Staff, and if they have to take charge of a Mahratta State\r\nthey are obliged to pass an examination in classical Persian poetry.\r\nThis is as it ought to be. The intricacies of Oriental intrigue and\r\nthe manifold complication of tenure and revenue that entangle\r\nadministrative procedure in the protected principalities, will unravel\r\nthemselves in presence of men who have enjoyed such advantages.\r\n\r\nWhen I first came out to this country I was placed in charge of three\r\ndegrees of latitude and eight of longitude in Rajputana that I might\r\nlearn the language. The soil was sandy, the tenure feudal\r\n(_zabardast_,[I] as we call it in India), and the Raja a lunatic by\r\nnature and a dipsomaniac by education. He had been educated by his\r\ngrandmamma and the hereditary Minister. I found that his grandmamma\r\nand the hereditary Minister were most anxious to relieve me of the\r\nmost embarrassing details of government, so I handed them a copy of\r\nthe Ten Commandments, underlining two that I thought might be useful,\r\nand put them in charge. They were old-fashioned in their methods--like\r\nSir Billy Jones; but the result was admirable. In two years the\r\nrevenue was reduced from ten to two lakhs of rupees, and the\r\nexpenditure proportionately increased. A bridge, a summer-house, and a\r\nschool were built; and I wrote the longest \"Administration Report\"\r\nthat has ever issued from the Zulmabad Residency. When I left money\r\nwas so cheap and lightly regarded that I sold my old buggy horse for\r\ntwo thousand rupees to grandmamma, with many mutual expressions of\r\ngood-will--through a curtain--and I have not been paid to this day.\r\nBut since then the horse-market has been ruined in the native states\r\nby these imperial _mélas_[J] and durbars. A poor Political has no\r\nchance against these Government of India people, who come down with\r\nstrings of three-legged horses, and--no, I won't say they sell them to\r\nthe chiefs--I should be having a commission of my _khidmatgars_[K]\r\nsitting upon me, like poor Har Sahai, who was beaten by Mr. Saunders,\r\nand Malhar Rao Gaikwar, who fancied his Resident was going to poison\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI like to see a Political up at Simla wooing that hoyden Promotion in\r\nher own sequestered bower. It is good to see Hercules toiling at the\r\nfeet of Omphale. It is good to see Pistol fed upon leeks by\r\nUnder-Secretaries and women. How simple he is! How boyish he can be,\r\nand yet how intense! He will play leap frog at Annandale; he will\r\npaddle about in the stream below the water-falls without shoes and\r\nstockings; but if you allude in the most distant way to rajas or\r\ndurbars, he lets down his face a couple of holes and talks like a\r\nweather prophet. He will be so interesting that you can hardly bear\r\nit; so interesting that you will feel sorry he is not talking to the\r\nGovernor-General up at Peterhoff.\r\n\r\n[But I feel that an Agent to the Governor-General is looking over my\r\nshoulder, so perhaps I had better stop; though I know two or three\r\nthings about Politicals.]--SIR ALI BABA, K.C.B.[L]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE COLLECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[October 4, 1879.]\r\n\r\nWas it not the Bishop of Bombay who said that man was an automaton\r\nplus the mirror of consciousness? The Government of every Indian\r\nprovince is an automaton plus the mirror of consciousness. The\r\nSecretariat is consciousness, and the Collectors form the automaton.\r\nThe Collector works, and the Secretariat observes and registers.\r\n\r\nTo the people of India the Collector is the Imperial Government. He\r\nwatches over their welfare in the many facets which reflect our\r\ncivilisation. He establishes schools and dispensaries [for their\r\nchildren], gaols [for their troublesome relations and neighbours], and\r\ncourts of justice [for the benefit of their brothers who can talk and\r\nwrite]. He levies the rent of their fields, he fixes the tariff, and\r\nhe nominates to every appointment, from that of road-sweeper or\r\nconstable, to the great blood-sucking officers round the Court and\r\nTreasury. As for Boards of Revenue and Lieutenant-Governors who\r\noccasionally come sweeping across the country, with their locust hosts\r\nof servants and petty officials, they are but an occasional nightmare;\r\nwhile the Governor-General is a mere shadow in the background of\r\nthought, half blended with \"John Company Bahadur\" and other myths of\r\nthe dawn.\r\n\r\nThe Collector lives in a long rambling bungalow furnished with folding\r\nchairs and tables, and in every way marked by the provisional\r\narrangements of camp life. He seems to have just arrived from out of\r\nthe firmament of green fields and mango groves that encircles the\r\nlittle station where he lives; or he seems just about to pass away\r\ninto it again. The shooting-howdahs are lying in the verandah, the\r\nelephant of a neighbouring landowner is swinging his hind foot to and\r\nfro under a tree, or switching up straw and leaves on to his back, a\r\ndozen camels are lying down in a circle making bubbling noises, and\r\ntents are pitched here and there to dry, like so many white wings on\r\nwhich the whole establishment is about to rise and fly away--fly away\r\ninto \"the district,\" which is the correct expression for the vast\r\nexpanse of level plain melting into blue sky on the wide\r\nhorizon-circle around.\r\n\r\nThe Collector is a bustling man. He is always in a hurry. His\r\nmultitudinous duties succeed one another so fast that one is never\r\nended before the next begins. A mysterious thing called \"the Joint\"\r\ncomes gleaning after him, I believe, and completes the inchoate work.\r\n\r\nThe verandah is full of fat black men in clean linen waiting for\r\ninterviews. They are bankers, shopkeepers, and landholders, who have\r\nonly come to \"pay their respects,\" with ever so little a petition as a\r\ncorollary. The chuprassie-vultures hover about them. Each of these\r\nobscene fowls has received a gratification from each of the clean fat\r\nmen; else the clean fat men would not be in the verandah. This import\r\ntax is a wholesome restraint upon the excessive visiting tendencies of\r\nwealthy men of colour. [Several little groups of] brass dishes filled\r\nwith pistachio nuts and candied sugar are ostentatiously displayed\r\nhere and there; they are the oblations of the would-be visitors. The\r\nEnglish call these offerings \"dollies\"; the natives _dáli_. They\r\nrepresent in the profuse East the visiting cards of the meagre West.\r\n\r\nAlthough from our lofty point of observation, among the pine-trees,\r\nthe Collector seems to be of the smallest social calibre, a mere\r\ncarronade, not to be distinguished by any proper name; in his own\r\ndistrict he is a Woolwich Infant; and a little community of\r\nmicroscopicals,--doctors, engineers, inspectors of schools, and\r\nassistant magistrates, look up to him as to a magnate.\r\n\r\nThey tell little stories of his weaknesses and eccentricities, and his\r\nwife is considered a person entitled \"to give herself airs\" (within\r\nthe district) if she feels so disposed; while to their high dinners is\r\nallowed the use of champagne and \"Europe\" talk on æsthetic subjects.\r\nThe Collector is not, however, permitted to wear a chimney-pot hat and\r\ngloves on Sunday (unless he has been in the Provincial Secretariat as\r\na boy); a Terai hat is sufficient for a Collector.\r\n\r\nA Collector is usually a sportsman; when he is a poet, a\r\nco-respondent, or a neologist it is thought rather a pity; and he is\r\nspoken of in undertones. Neology is considered especially\r\nreprehensible. The junior member of the Board of Revenue, or even the\r\nCommissioner of a division (if he be _pukka_)[M], may question the\r\nliteral inspiration of Genesis; but it is not good form for a\r\nCollector to tamper with his Bible. A Collector should have no leisure\r\nfor opinions of any sort.\r\n\r\nI have said that a Collector is usually a sportsman. In this capacity\r\nhe is frequently made use of by the Viceroy and long-shore Governors,\r\nas he is an adept at showing sport to globe-trotters. The villagers\r\nwho live on the borders of the jungle will generally turn out and beat\r\nfor the Collector, and the petty chief who owns the jungle always\r\nkeeps a tiger or two for district officers. A Political Agent's tiger\r\nis known to be a domestic animal suitable for delicate noble Lords\r\ntravelling for health; but a Collector's tiger is often [believed to\r\nbe almost] a wild beast, although usually reared upon buffalo calves\r\nand accustomed to be driven. [Of course the tiger which the Collector\r\nand his friends shoot is quite an inferior article; a fierce, roaming\r\ncreature that lives upon spotted deer when it can get them, but is\r\noften quite savage from hunger.] The Collector, who is always the most\r\nunselfish and hospitable of men, only kills the fatted tiger for\r\npersons of distinction with letters of introduction. Any common jungle\r\ntiger, even a man-eater, is good enough for himself and his friends.\r\n\r\nThe Collector never ventures to approach Simla, when on leave. At\r\nSimla people would stare and raise their eye-brows if they heard that\r\na Collector was on the hill. They would ask what sort of a thing a\r\nCollector was. The Press Commissioner would be sent to interview it.\r\nThe children at Peterhoff would send for it to play with. So the\r\nclodhopping Collector goes to Naini Tal or Darjiling, where he is\r\nknown either as Ellenborough Higgins, or Higgins of Gharibpur in\r\nterritorial fashion. Here he is understood. Here he can bubble of his\r\n_Bandobast_,[N] his _Balbacha_[O] and his _Bawarchikhana_;[P] and here\r\nhe can speak in familiar accents of his neighbours, Dalhousie Smith\r\nand Cornwallis Jones. All day long he strides up and down the club\r\nverandah with his old Haileybury chum Teignmouth Tompkins; and they\r\ncompare experiences of the hunting-field and office, and denounce in\r\nunmeasured terms of Oriental vituperation the new sort of civilian who\r\nmoves about with the Penal Code under his arm and measures his\r\nauthority by statute, clause, and section.\r\n\r\nIn England the Collector is to be found riding at anchor in the\r\nBandicoot Club. He makes two or three hurried cruises to his native\r\nvillage, where he finds himself half forgotten. This sours him. The\r\nclimate seems worse than of old, the means of locomotion at his\r\ndisposal are inconvenient and expensive; he yearns for the sunshine\r\nand elephants of Gharibpur, and returns an older and a quieter man.\r\nThe afternoon of life is throwing longer shadows, the Acheron of\r\npromotion is gaping before him; he falls into a Commissionership;\r\nstill deeper into an officiating seat on the Board of Revenue.\r\n_Facilis est descensus, etc._ Nothing will save him now;\r\ntransmigration has set in; the gates of Simla fly open; it is all\r\nover. Let us pray that his halo may fit him.--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. X\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABY IN PARTIBUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[October 11, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe Empire has done less for Anglo-Indian Babies than for any class of\r\nthe great exile community. Legislation provides them with neither\r\nrattle nor coral, privilege leave nor pension. Papa has a Raja and\r\nStar of India to play with; Mamma the Warrant of Precedence and the\r\nHill Captains; but Baby has nothing--not even a missionary; Baby is\r\nwithout the amusement of the meanest cannibal.\r\n\r\nBaby is debarred from the society of his compatriots. His father is\r\ncramped and frozen with the chill cares of office; his mother is\r\ndeadened by the gloomy routine of economy and fashion; custom lies\r\nupon her with a weight heavy as frost and deep almost as life; the\r\nfountains of natural fancy and mirth are frozen over; so Baby lisps\r\nhis dawn pæans in soft Oriental accents, wakening harmonious echoes\r\namongst those impulsive and impressionable children of Nature that\r\nmasque themselves in the black slough of Bearers and Ayahs; and Baby\r\nblubbers in Hindustani.\r\n\r\nThese Ayah and Bearer people sit with Baby in the verandah on a little\r\ncarpet; broken toys and withered flowers lie around. They croon to\r\nBaby some old-world _katabaukalesis_, while beauty, born of murmuring\r\nsound, passes into Baby's eyes. The squirrel sits chirruping\r\nfamiliarly on the edge of the verandah with his tail in the air and\r\nsome uncracked pericarp in his uplifted hands, the kite circles aloft\r\nand whistles a shrill and mournful note, the sparrows chatter, the\r\ncrow clears his throat, the minas scream discordantly, and Baby's\r\nsoft, receptive nature thus absorbs an Indian language. Very soon Baby\r\nwill think from right to left, and will lisp in the luxuriant bloom of\r\nOriental hyperbole. [Presently, when Baby grows a little older, Baby\r\nwill say to the Bearer, through his sweet little nose, \"Arreh! Ulu ka\r\nbacha, tu kya karta hai?\" Which being interpreted, is, \"Ah! Child of\r\nnight's sweet bird, what dost thou now?\" Afterwards Baby will learn to\r\nsay many other things which it is not good to repeat here.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening Baby will go out for an airing with the Bearer and Ayah\r\npeople, and while they dawdle along the dusty road, or sit on\r\nkerb-stones and on culvert parapets, he will listen to the extensile\r\ntale of their simple sorrows. He will hear, with a sigh, that the\r\nprofits of petty larceny are declining; he will be taught to regret\r\nthe increasing infirmities of his Papa's temper; and portraits in\r\nsepia of his Mamma will be observed by him to excite laughter mingled\r\nwith dark impulsive words. Thus there will pass into Baby's eyes\r\nglances of suspicious questionings, \"the blank misgivings of a\r\ncreature moving about in worlds not realised.\"\r\n\r\nIn the long summer days Baby will patter listlessly about the darkened\r\nrooms accompanied by his suite, who will carry a feeding bottle--Maw's\r\nPatent Feeding Bottle--just as the Sergeant-at-Arms carries the mace;\r\nand, from time to time, little Mister Speaker will squat down on his\r\ndear little hams and take a refreshing pull or two. At breakfast and\r\nluncheon time little Mister Speaker will straggle into the\r\ndining-room, and fond parents will give him a tidbit of many soft\r\ndainties, to be washed down with brandy and water, beer, sherry, or\r\nother alcoholic draught. On such broken meals Baby is raised.\r\n\r\nThe little drawn face, etiolated and weary-looking, recommends sleep;\r\nbut Baby is a bad sleeper. The Bearer-in-waiting carries about a small\r\npillow all day long, and from time to time Baby is applied to it. He\r\nfrets and cries, and they brood over him humming some old Indian song,\r\n[\"Keli Blai,\" or \"Hillu Milli Pania\"]. Still he turns restlessly and\r\nwhimpers, though they pat him and shampoo him, and call him fond names\r\nand tell him soothing stories of bulbuls and flowers and woolly sheep.\r\nBut Baby does not sleep, and even Indian patience is exhausted. Both\r\nAyah and Bearer would like to slip away to their mud houses at the\r\nother end of the compound and have a pull at the fragrant _huqqa_ and\r\na gossip with the _saices;_[Q] but while _Sunny Baba_ is at large, and\r\nmight at any moment make a raid on Mamma, who is dozing over a novel\r\non a spider-chair near the mouth of the thermantidote, the Ayah and\r\nBearer dare not leave their charge. So _Sunny Baba_ must sleep, and\r\nthe Bearer has in the folds of his waist-cloth a little black fragment\r\nof the awful sleep-compeller, and Baby is drugged into a deep uneasy\r\nsleep of delirious, racking dreams.\r\n\r\nDay by day Baby grows paler, day by day thinner, day by day a stranger\r\nlight burns in his bonny eyes. Weird thoughts sweep through Baby's\r\nbrain, weird questions startle Mamma out of the golden languors in\r\nwhich she is steeped, weird words frighten the gentle Ayah as she\r\nfondles her darling. The current of babble and laughter has almost\r\nceased to flow. Baby lies silent in the Ayah's lap staring at the\r\nceiling. He clasps a broken toy with wasted fingers. His Bearer comes\r\nwith some old watchword of fun; Baby smiles faintly, but makes no\r\nresponse. The old man takes him tenderly in his arms and carries him\r\nto the verandah; Baby's head falls heavily on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe outer world lies dimly round Baby; within, strange shadows are\r\nflitting by. The wee body is pressing heavily upon the spirit; Baby is\r\nbecoming conscious of the burthen. He will be quiet for hours on his\r\nlittle cot; he does not sleep, but he dreams. Earth's joys and lights\r\nare fast fading out of those resilient eyes; Baby's spirit is waiting\r\non the shores of eternity, and already hears \"the mighty waters\r\nrolling evermore.\"\r\n\r\nThe broken toys are swept away into a corner, a silence and fear has\r\nfallen upon the household, black servants weep, their mistress seeks\r\nrefuge in headache and smelling salts, the hard father feels a\r\nstrange, an irrepressible welling up of little memories. He loves the\r\ngolden haired boy; he hardly knew it before. If he could only hear\r\nonce more the merry laugh, the chatter and the shouting! But he cannot\r\nhear it any more; he will never hear his child's voice again. Baby has\r\npassed into the far-away Thought-World. Baby is now only a dream and a\r\nmemory, only the recollection of a music that is heard no more. Baby\r\nhas crossed that cloudy, storm-driven bourn of speculation and fear\r\nwhither we are all tending.\r\n\r\n      A few white bones upon a lonely sand,\r\n      A rotting corpse beneath the meadow grass,\r\n      That cannot hear the footsteps as they pass,\r\n      Memorial urns pressed by some foolish hand\r\n      Have been for all the goal of troublous fears,\r\n      Ah! breaking hearts and faint eyes dim with tears,\r\n      And momentary hope by breezes framed\r\n      To flame that ever fading falls again,\r\n      And leaves but blacker night and deeper pain,\r\n      Have been the mould of life in every land.\r\n\r\nBaby is planted out for evermore in the dank and weedy little cemetery\r\nthat lies on the outskirts of the station where he lived and died.\r\nThose golden curls, those soft and rounded limbs, and that laughing\r\nmouth, are given up to darkness and the eternal hunger of corruption.\r\nThrough sunshine and rain, through the long days of summer, through\r\nthe long nights of winter, for ever, for ever, Baby lies silent and\r\ndreamless under that waving grass. The bee will hum overhead for\r\nevermore, and the swallow glance among the cypress. The butterfly will\r\nflutter for ages and ages among the rank flowers--Baby will still lie\r\nthere. Come away, come away; your cheeks are pale; it cannot be, we\r\ncannot believe it, we must not remember it; other Baby voices will\r\nkindle our life and love, Baby's toys will pass to other Baby hands.\r\nAll will change; we will change.\r\n\r\n      Yet, darling, but come back to me;\r\n      Whatever change the years have wrought,\r\n      I find not yet one lonely thought\r\n      That cries against my wish for thee.\r\n\r\n                                          ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED CHUPRASSIE\r\n\r\nOR, THE CORRUPT LICTOR[R]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[October 18, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe red chuprassie is our Colorado beetle, our potato disease, our\r\nHome ruler, our cupboard skeleton, the little rift in our lute. The\r\nred-coated chuprassie is a cancer in our Administration. To be rid of\r\nit there is hardly any surgical operation we would not cheerfully\r\nundergo. You might extract the Bishop of Bombay, amputate the Governor\r\nof Madras, put a seton in the pay and allowances of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and we should smile.\r\n\r\nThe red chuprassie is ubiquitous; he is in the verandah of every\r\nofficial's house in India, from the Governor-General downwards; he is\r\nin the portico of every Court of Justice, every Treasury, every Public\r\nOffice, every Government School, every Government Dispensary in the\r\ncountry. He walks behind the Collector; he follows the conservancy\r\ncarts; he prowls about the candidate for employment; he hovers over\r\nthe accused and accuser; he haunts the Raja; he infests the tax-payer.\r\n\r\nHe wears the Imperial livery; he is to the entire population of India\r\nthe exponent of British Rule; he is the mother-in-law of liars, the\r\nhigh-priest of extortioners, and the receiver-general of bribes.\r\n\r\nThrough this refracting medium the people of India see their rulers.\r\nThe chuprassie paints his master in colours drawn from his own black\r\nheart. Every lie he tells, every insinuation he throws out, every\r\ndemand he makes, is endorsed with his master's name. He is the\r\narch-slanderer of our name in India.\r\n\r\n[He is not an individual--he is a member of a widely rammified\r\nsociety.] There is no city in India, no mofussil-station, no little\r\nsettlement of officials far up country, in which the chuprassie does\r\nnot find sworn brothers and confederates. The cutcherry clerks and the\r\npolice are with him everywhere; higher native officials are often on\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nHe sits at the receipt of custom in the Collector's verandah, and no\r\nnative visitor dare approach who has not conciliated him with money.\r\nThe candidate for employment, educated in our schools, and pregnant\r\nwith words about purity, equality, justice, political economy, and all\r\nthe rest of it, addresses him with joined hands as \"Maharaj,\" and\r\nslips silver into his itching palm. The successful place-hunter pays\r\nhim a feudal relief on receiving office or promotion, and benevolences\r\nflow in from all who have anything to hope or fear from those in\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RED CHUPRASSIE--\"The corrupt lictor.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the Native States the chuprassie flourishes rampantly. He receives\r\na regular salary through their representatives or vakils at the\r\nagencies, from all the native chiefs round about, and on all occasions\r\nof visits or return visits, durbars, religious festivals, or public\r\nceremonials, he claims and receives preposterous fees. The Rajas,\r\nwhose dignity is always exceedingly delicate, stand in great fear of\r\nthe chuprassies. They believe that on public occasions the chuprassies\r\nhave sometimes the power of sicklying them o'er with the pale cast of\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nEnglish officers who have become de-Europeanised from long residence\r\namong undomesticated natives, or by the habitual performance of petty\r\nceremonial duties of an Oriental hue, employ chuprassies to aggrandise\r\ntheir importance. They always figure on a background of red\r\nchuprassies. Such officials are what Lord Lytton calls White Baboos.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Whitley Stokes, in his own artless way, once proposed legislating\r\nagainst chuprassies, I am told. His plan was to include them among the\r\ncriminal classes, and hand them over to Major Henderson, the\r\nDirector-General of Thuggee and Dacoity; but this functionary, viewing\r\nthe matter in a different light, made some demi-official\r\nrepresentation to the Legal Member under the pseudonym of \"Walker,\"\r\nand the subject dropped.]\r\n\r\nA great Maharaja once told me that it was the tyranny of the\r\nGovernment chuprassies that made him take to drink. He spoke of them\r\nas \"the Pindarries of modern India.\" He had a theory that the small\r\npay we gave them accounted for their evil courses. A chuprassie gets\r\nabout eight pounds sterling a year. He added that if we saw a\r\nchuprassie on seven rupees a month living overtly at the rate of a\r\nthousand, we ought immediately to appoint him an _attaché_ or put him\r\nin gaol.\r\n\r\nI make a simple rule in my own establishment of dismissing a\r\nchuprassie as soon as he begins to wax fat. A native cannot become\r\nrich without waxing fat, because wealth is primarily enjoyed by the\r\nmild Gentoo as a means of procuring greasy food in large quantities.\r\nHis secondary enjoyment is to sit upon it. He digs a hole in the\r\nground for his rupees, and broods over them, like a great obscene\r\nfowl. If you see a native sitting very hard on the same place day\r\nafter day, you will find it worth your while to dig him up. Shares in\r\nthis are better than the Madras gold mines.\r\n\r\nIn early Company days, when the Empire was a baby, the European\r\nwriters[S] regarded with a kindly eye those profuse Orientals who went\r\nabout bearing gifts; but Lord Clive closed this branch of the\r\nbusiness, and it has been taken up by our scarlet runners or verandah\r\nparasites, in our name. Now, dear Vanity, you may call me a\r\nRussophile, or by any other marine term of endearment you like, if I\r\ndon't think the old plan was the better of the two. We ourselves could\r\nconduct corruption decently; but to be responsible for corruption over\r\nwhich we exercise no control is to lose the credit of a good name and\r\nthe profits of a bad one.\r\n\r\n[Old qui-hyes tell you that there are three things you cannot separate\r\nfrom an \"Indian\"--venality, perjury, and rupees. Now I totally\r\ndisagree with the old qui-hyes. In secret I am a great admirer of the\r\nIndian, and publicly I always treat him with respect. I have such a\r\nregard for him that I never expose him to temptation. I pay him well,\r\nI explain to him my eccentric opinions about receiving bribes, and I\r\nremind him of the moral and electrifying properties of the different\r\nspecies of cane which Nature has so thoughtfully provided nearly\r\neverywhere in India. The consequence is that my chuprassies do not\r\nsoil their hands with spurious gratifications, and figuratively\r\ndescribe me as their father and mother.]\r\n\r\nI hear that the Government of India proposes to form a mixed committee\r\nof Rajas and chuprassies to discuss the question as to whether native\r\nchiefs ever give bribes and native servants ever take them. It is\r\nexpected that a report favourable to Indian morality will be the\r\nresult. Of course Raja Joe Hookham will preside.--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FARMER PRINCE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLANTER--\"A farmer prince.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[October 25, 1879]\r\n\r\nThe Planter lives to-day as we all lived fifty years ago. He lives in\r\nstate and bounty, like the Lord of Burleigh. He lives like that fine\r\nold English gentleman who had an old estate, and who kept up his old\r\nmansion at a bountiful old rate. He lives in a grand wholesale manner;\r\nhe lives in round numbers; he lives like a hero. Everything is Homeric\r\nabout him. He establishes himself firmly in the land with great joy\r\nand plenty; and he gathers round him all that makes life full-toned\r\nand harmonious, from the grand timbre of draught-ale and the\r\norgan-thunder of hunting, to the piccolo and tintinnabulum of Poker\r\nand maraschino. His life is a fresco-painting, on which some Cyclopæan\r\nRaphaelite has poured his rainbows from a fire-engine of a hundred\r\nelephant-power.\r\n\r\nWe paltry officials live meanly in pen-and-ink sketches. Our little\r\nlife is bounded by a dream of promotion and pension. We toil, we\r\nslave; we put by money, we pinch ourselves. We are hardly fit to live\r\nin this beautiful world, with its laughing girls and grapes, its\r\nsummer seas, its sunshine and flowers, its Garnet Wolseleys and\r\nbulbuls. We go moping through its glories in green spectacles,\r\nbefouling it with our loathsome statistics and reports. The sweet air\r\nof heaven, the blue firmament, and the everlasting hills do not\r\nsatisfy our poisoned hearts; so we make to ourselves a little tin-pot\r\nworld of blotted-paper, debased rupees, graded lists, and tinsel\r\nhonours; we try to feed our lungs on its typhoidal effluvia. Aroint[T]\r\nthee, Comptroller and Accountant-General with all thy grisly crew!\r\nThou art worse than the blind Fury with the abhorred shears; for thou\r\nslittest my thin-spun pay-wearing spectacles, thrice branded varlet!\r\n[There is a lily on my brow with anguish moist and fever-dew, and on\r\nmy cheeks a fading rose fast withereth too, and for these emblems of\r\nwoe thou shalt have to give an answer.]\r\n\r\nDear Vanity, of course you understand that I do not allude to the\r\namiable old gentleman who controls our Accounts Department, who is the\r\nmirror of tenderness. The person I would impale is a creation of my\r\nown wrath, a mere official type struck in frenzied fancy, [at a moment\r\nwhen Time seems a maniac scattering dust, and Life a Fury slinging\r\nflame].\r\n\r\nLet us soothe ourselves by contemplating the Planter and his generous,\r\nsimple life. It calms one to look at him. He is something placid,\r\nstrong, and easeful. Without wishing to appear obsequious, I always\r\nfeel disposed to borrow money when I meet a substantial Planter. He\r\ninspires confidence. I grasp his strong hand; I take him\r\n(figuratively) to my heart, while the desire to bank with him wells up\r\nmysteriously in my bosom.\r\n\r\nHe lives in a grand old bungalow, surrounded by ancient trees. Large\r\nrooms open into one another on every side in long vistas; a broad and\r\nhospitable-looking verandah girds all. Everywhere trophies of the\r\nchase meet the eye. We walk upon cool matting; we recline upon\r\nlong-armed chairs; low and heavy punkahs swing overhead; a sweet\r\nbreathing of wet _khaskhas_ grass comes sobbing out of the\r\nthermantidote; and a gigantic but gentle _khidmatgar_ is always at our\r\nelbow with long glasses on a silver tray. This man's name is Nubby\r\nBux, but he means nothing by it, and a child might play with him. I\r\noften say to him in a caressing tone, \"_Peg lao_\";[U] and he is\r\ngrateful for any little attention of this sort.\r\n\r\nIt is near noon. My friend Mr. Great-Heart, familiarly known as \"Jamie\r\nMacdonald,\" has been taking me over the factory and stables. We have\r\nbeen out since early morning on the jumpiest and beaniest of Waler\r\nmares. I am not killed, but a good deal shaken. The glass trembles in\r\nmy hand. I have an absorbing thirst, and I drink copiously, almost\r\npassionately. My out-stretched legs are reposing on the arms of my\r\nchair and I stiffen into an attitude of rest. I hear my host splashing\r\nand singing in his tub.\r\n\r\nBreakfast is a meal conceived in a large and liberal spirit. We pass\r\nfrom dish to dish through all the compass of a banquet, the diapason\r\nclosing full in beer. Several joyful assistants, whose appetites would\r\ntake first-class honours at any university or cattle show, join the\r\nhunt and are well in at the beer. What tales are told! I feel glad\r\nthat Miss Harriet Martineau, Mrs. Mary Somerville, and Dr. Watts are\r\nnot present. I keep looking round to see that no bishop comes into the\r\nroom. It is a comfort to me to think that Bishop Heber is dead. I gave\r\nup blushing five years ago when I entered the Secretariat; but if at\r\nthis moment Sir William Jones were to enter, or Mr. Whitley Stokes\r\nwith his child-like heart and his Cymric vocabulary, I believe I\r\nshould be strangely affected.\r\n\r\nThe day welters on through drink and billiards. In the afternoon more\r\njoyful Planters drop in, and we play a rubber. From whist to the polo\r\nground, where I see the merry men of Tirhoot play the best and fastest\r\ngame that the world can show. At night carousals and potations pottle\r\ndeep. Next morning sees the entire party in the _khadar_[V] of the\r\nriver, mounted on Arabs, armed with spears, hunting Jamie Macdonald's\r\nCaledonian boar. These Scotchmen never forget their nationality.\r\n\r\nAnd while these joyful Planters are thus rejoicing, the indigo is\r\ngrowing silently all round. While they play, Nature works for them. So\r\ndoes the patient black man; he smokes his _huqqa_ and keeps an eye on\r\nthe rising crop.\r\n\r\nYou will have learnt from Mr. Caird that indigo grows in cakes (the\r\nale is imported); to his description of the process of manufacture I\r\ncan only add that the juice is generally expressed in the vernacular.\r\nYou give a cake of the raw material to a coloured servant, you stand\r\nover him to see that he doesn't eat it, and your assistant canes him\r\nslowly as he squeezes the juice into a blue bottle. Blue pills are\r\nmade of the refuse; your female servants use aniline dyes; and there\r\nyou are. If any one dies in any other way you can refuse him the rites\r\nof cremation; fine him four annas; and warn him not to do it again.\r\nThis is a burning question in Tirhoot and occasions much litigation.\r\n\r\nJamie Macdonald has now a contract for dyeing the Blue ribbons of the\r\nTurf; Tommy Begg has taken the blue boars and the Oxford Blues; and\r\nBobby Thomas does the blue-books and the True Blues. It may not be\r\ngenerally known that the aristocracy do not employ aniline dyes for\r\ntheir blue blood. The minor Planters do business chiefly in blue\r\nstockings, blue bonnets, blue bottles, blue beards, and blue coats.\r\nFor more information of this kind I can only refer you to Mr. Caird\r\nand the _Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\nSome Planters grow tea, coffee, lac, mother-of-pearl, pickles,\r\npoppadums and curry powder--but now I am becoming encyclopædic and\r\nscientific, and trespassing on ground already taken up by the Famine\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nFewer Planters are killed now by wild camels who roam over the mango\r\nfields, but a good deal of damage is still done to the prickly\r\npear-trees. Mr. Cunningham has written an interesting note on this.\r\nRewards have still to be offered for dead tigers and persons who have\r\ndied of starvation. \"When the Government will not give a doit to\r\nrelieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.\"--\r\nALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EURASIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STUDY IN CHIARO-OSCURO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EURASIAN--\"A study in chiaro oscuro.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[November 1, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Indian has a very fine eye for colour. He will mark down\r\n\"one anna in the rupee\" with unerring certainty; he will suspect\r\nsmaller coin. He will tell you how he can detect an adulterated\r\nEuropean by his knuckles, his nails, his eyebrows, his pronunciation\r\nof the vowels, and his conception of propriety in dress, manner, and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nTo the thorough-bred Anglo-Indian, whose blood has distilled through\r\nHaileybury for three generations, and whose cousins to the fourth\r\ndegree are Collectors and Indian Army Colonels, the Eurasian, however\r\nfair he may be, is a _bête noir_. Mrs. Ellenborough Higgins is always\r\nsetting or pointing at black blood.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes the whitey-brown man is objectionable. He is vain, apt\r\nto take offence, sly, indolent, sensuous, and, like Reuben, \"unstable\r\nas water.\" He has a facile smile, a clammy hand, a manner either\r\nforward or obsequious, a mincing gait, and not always the snowiest\r\nlinen. [In very dangerous cases he has a peculiar smell.]\r\n\r\nTowards natives the Eurasian is cold, haughty, and formal; and this\r\nattitude is repaid, with interest, in scorn and hatred. There is no\r\nconcealing the fact that to the mild Gentoo the Eurasian is a very\r\ndistasteful object.\r\n\r\nBut having said this, the case for the prosecution closes, and we may\r\nturn to the many soft and gentle graces which the Eurasian develops.\r\n\r\nIn all the relations of family life the Eurasian is admirable. He is a\r\ndutiful son, a circumspect husband, and an affectionate father. He\r\nseldom runs through a fortune; he hardly ever elopes with a young lady\r\nof fashion; he is not in the habit of cutting off his son with a\r\nshilling; and he is an infrequent worshipper in that Temple of\r\nSeparation where _Decrees Nisi_ sever the Gordian knots of Hymen.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen he is zealously loyal. He will speak at municipal\r\nmeetings, write letters about drainage and conservancy to the papers,\r\nobserve local holidays in his best clothes, and attend funerals.\r\n\r\nThe Eurasian is a methodical and trustworthy clerk, and often occupies\r\na position of great trust and responsibility in our public offices. He\r\nis not bold or original, like Sir Andrew Clarke; or amusing, like Mr.\r\nStokes; but he does what work is given him to do without overstepping\r\nthe modesty of nature.\r\n\r\n[Most Eurasians are Catholics; but some belong to the small Protestant\r\nheresies and call themselves Presbyterians, Anabaptists, and what not.\r\nTo whatever creed they attach themselves, they are faithful and\r\ndevoted; but the pageantry, the music, the antiquity, and the mystery\r\nof the ancient Church, draw forth, with the most potent spells, the\r\nfervour of their warm, emotional natures. They are never sceptical:\r\nthe harder a doctrine is to believe the more they like it; the more\r\nimprobable a tradition is the more tenaciously they cling to it. They\r\nare attracted by the supernatural and the horrible; they would not\r\nbate a single saint or devil of the complete faith to rescue all the\r\ntruths of modern science from the ban of the Church.]\r\n\r\nThe Eurasian girl is often pretty and graceful; and, if the solution\r\nof India in her veins be weak, there is an unconventionality and\r\n_naïveté_ sometimes which undoubtedly has a charm; and which, my dear\r\nfriend, J.H----, of the 110th Clodhoppers (Lord Cardwell's Own\r\nClodhoppers) never could resist: \"What though upon her lips there hung\r\nthe accents of the tchi-tchi tongue.\"\r\n\r\nA good many Eurasians who are not clerks in public offices, or\r\ntelegraph signallers, or merchants, are loafers. They are passed on\r\nwherever they are found, to the next station, and thus they are kept\r\nin healthy circulation throughout India. They are all in search of\r\nemployment on the railway; but as a provisional arrangement, to meet\r\nthe more immediate and pressing exigencies of life, they will accept a\r\nsmall gratuity, [or engage themselves in snapping up unconsidered\r\ntrifles]. They are mainly supported by municipalities, who keep them\r\nin brandy, rice, and railway-tickets out of funds raised for this\r\npurpose. Workhouses and Malacca canes have still to be tried.\r\n\r\nBishop Gell's plan for colonising the Laccadives and Cocos with these\r\nloafers has not met with much acceptance at Simla. The Home Secretary\r\ndoes not see from what Imperial fund they can be supplied with\r\nbathing-drawers and barrel-organs; but the Home Secretary ought to\r\nknow that there is a philanthropic society at Lucknow of the\r\ndisinterested, romantic, Turnerelli type, ready to furnish all the\r\nwants of a young colony, from underclothing to Eno's fruit salt.\r\n\r\nA great many wise proposals emanate from Simla as regards some\r\nartificial future for the Eurasian. One Ten-thousand-pounder asks\r\nCreation in a petulant tone of surprise why Creation does not make the\r\nEurasian a carpenter; another looks round the windy hills and wonders\r\nwhy somebody does not make the Eurasian a high farmer. The shovel hats\r\nare surprised that the Eurasian does not become a missionary, or a\r\nschoolmaster, or a policeman, or something of that sort. The native\r\npapers say, \"Deport him\"; the white prints say, \"Make him a soldier\";\r\nand the Eurasian himself says, \"Make me a Commissioner, or give me a\r\npension.\" In the meantime, while nothing is being done, we can rail at\r\nthe Eurasian for not being as we are.\r\n\r\n      \"Let us sit on the thrones\r\n        In a purple sublimity,\r\n      And grind down men's bones\r\n        To a pale unanimity.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no proper classification of the mixed race in India as there\r\nis in America. The convenient term _quadroon_, for instance, instead\r\nof \"four annas in the rupee,\" is quite unknown; the consequence is\r\nthat every one--from Anna Maria de Souza, the \"Portuguese\" cook, a\r\nnobleman on whose cheek the best shoe-blacking would leave a white\r\nmark, to pretty Miss Fitzalan Courtney, of the Bombay Fencibles, who\r\nis as white as an Italian princess--is called an \"Eurasian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, dear Vanity, that it is not impossible that King Asoka\r\n(of the Edict Pillars), the 'Constantine of Buddhism,' was an\r\nEurasian? I have not got the works of Arrian, or Mr. Lethbridge's\r\n'History of the World' at hand, but I have some recollection of\r\nSandracottus, or one of Asoka's fathers or grandfathers, marrying a\r\nMiss Megasthenes, or Seleucus. With such memories no wonder they call\r\nus 'Mean Whites.'\"--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGER\r\n\r\n      \"Venio nunc ad voluptates agricolarum, quibus ego\" (like the\r\n      Famine Commissioners) \"incredibiliter delector.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[November 8, 1879.]\r\n\r\nI missed two people at the Delhi Assemblage of 1877. All the gram-fed\r\nsecretaries and most of the alcoholic chiefs were there; but the\r\nfamine-haunted villager and the delirium-shattered, opium-eating\r\nChinaman, who had to pay the bill, were not present.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand why Viceroys and English newspapers call the\r\nIndian cultivator a \"riot.\" He never amounts to a riot if you treat\r\nhim properly. He may be a disorderly crowd sometimes; but that is only\r\nwhen you embody him in a police force or convert him into cavalry. The\r\natomic disembodied villager has no notion of rioting, _ça-ira_\r\nsinging, or any of the tomfooleries of revolution. These pastimes are\r\nfor men who are both idle and frivolous. When our villager wants to\r\nrealise a political idea, he dies of famine. This has about it a\r\ncertain air of seriousness. A man will not die of famine unless he be\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon's apothegm was that _Eating maketh a full man_; and it\r\nwould be better to give the starving cultivator Bacon than the report\r\nof that Commission (which we cannot name without tears and laughter)\r\nwhich goes to work on the assumption that _writing maketh a full\r\nman_--that to write over a certain area of paper will fill the\r\ncollapsed cuticles of the agricultural class throughout India.\r\n\r\nWhen [Sir Richard Temple] first started the idea of holding famines, I\r\nproposed that he should illustrate his project by stopping the pay and\r\nallowances of the Government of India for a month. But he did not\r\nlisten to my proposal. People seldom listen to my proposals; and\r\nsometimes I think that this accounts for my constitutional melancholy.\r\n\r\nYou will ask, \"What has all this talk of food and famine to do with\r\nthe villager?\" I reply, \"Everything.\" Famine is the horizon of the\r\nIndian villager; insufficient food is the foreground. And this is the\r\nmore extraordinary since the villager is surrounded by a dreamland of\r\nplenty. Everywhere you see fields flooded deep with millet and wheat.\r\nThe village and its old trees have to climb on to a knoll to keep\r\ntheir feet out of the glorious poppy and the luscious sugar-cane.\r\nSumptuous cream-coloured bullocks move sleepily about with an air of\r\nluxurious sloth; and sleek Brahmans utter their lazy prayers while\r\nbathing languidly in the water and sunshine of the tank. Even the\r\nbuffaloes have nothing to do but float the livelong day deeply\r\nimmersed in the bulrushes. Everything is steeped in repose. The bees\r\nmurmur their idylls among the flowers; the doves moan their amorous\r\ncomplaints from the shady leafage of pipal trees; out of the cool\r\nrecesses of wells the idle cooing of the pigeons ascends into the\r\nsummer-laden air; the rainbow-fed chameleon slumbers on the branch;\r\nthe enamelled beetle on the leaf; the little fish in the sparkling\r\ndepths below; the radiant kingfisher, tremulous as sunlight, in\r\nmid-air; and the peacock, with furled glories, on the temple tower of\r\nthe silent gods. Amid this easeful and luscious splendour the villager\r\nlabours and starves.\r\n\r\nReams of hiccoughing platitudes lodged in the pigeon-holes of the Home\r\nOffice by all the gentlemen clerks and gentlemen farmers of the world\r\ncannot mend this. While the Indian villager has to maintain the\r\nglorious phantasmagoria of an imperial policy, while he has to support\r\nlegions of scarlet soldiers, golden chuprassies, purple politicals,\r\nand green commissions, he must remain the hunger-stricken, overdriven\r\nphantom he is.\r\n\r\n      While the eagle of Thought rides the tempest in scorn,\r\n      Who cares if the lightning is burning the corn?\r\n\r\nIf Old England is going to maintain her throne and her swagger in our\r\nvast Orient she ought to pay up like a--man, I was going to say; for,\r\naccording to the old Sanscrit proverb, \"You can get nothing for\r\nnothing, and deuced little for a halfpenny.\" These unpaid-for glories\r\nbring nothing but shame.\r\n\r\nBut even the poor Indian cultivator has his joys beneath the clouds of\r\nRevenue Boards and Famine Commissions. If we look closely at his life\r\nwe may see a soft glory resting upon it. I am not Mr. Caird, and I do\r\nnot intend entering into the technical details of agriculture--\"_Quid\r\nde utilitate loquar stercorandi?_\"--but I would say something of that\r\nsweetness which a close communion with earth and heaven must shed upon\r\nthe silence of lonely labour in the fields. God is ever with the\r\ncultivator in all the manifold sights and sounds of this marvellous\r\nworld of His. In that mysterious temple of the Dawn, in which we of\r\nnoisy mess-rooms, heated courts, and dusty offices are infrequent\r\nworshippers, the peasant is a priest. There he offers up his hopes and\r\nfears for rain and sunshine; there he listens to the anthems of birds\r\nwe rarely hear, and interprets auguries that for us have little\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThe beast of prey skulking back to his lair, the stag quenching his\r\nthirst ere retiring to the depths of the forest, the wedge of wild\r\nfowl flying with trumpet notes to some distant lake, the vulture\r\nhastening in heavy flight to the carrion that night has provided, the\r\ncrane flapping to the shallows, and the jackal shuffling along to his\r\nshelter in the nullah, have each and all their portent to the\r\ninitiated eye. Day, with its fierce glories, brings the throbbing\r\nsilence of intense life, and under flickering shade, amid the soft\r\npulsations of Nature, the cultivator lives his daydream. What there is\r\nof squalor, and drudgery, and carking care in his life melts into a\r\nbrief oblivion, and he is a man in the presence of his God with the\r\nholy stillness of Nature brooding over him. With lengthening shadows\r\ncomes labour and a re-awaking. The air is once more full of all sweet\r\nsounds, from the fine whistle of the kite, sailing with supreme\r\ndominion through the azure depths of air, to the stir and buzzing\r\nchatter of little birds and crickets among the leaves and grass. The\r\negret has resumed his fishing in the tank where the rain is stored for\r\nthe poppy and sugarcane fields, the sand-pipers bustle along the\r\nmargin, or wheel in little silvery clouds over the bright waters, the\r\ngloomy cormorant sits alert on the stump of a dead date-tree, the\r\nlittle black divers hurry in and out of the weeds, and ever and anon\r\nshoot under the water in hot quest of some tiny fish; the whole\r\nmachinery of life and death is in full play, and our villager shouts\r\nto his patient oxen and lives his life. Then gradual darkness, and\r\nfood with homely joys, a little talk, a little tobacco, a few sad\r\nsongs, and kindly sleep.\r\n\r\nThe villages are of immemorial antiquity; their names, their\r\ntraditions, their hereditary offices have come down out of the dim\r\npast through countless generations. History sweeps over them with her\r\ntrampling armies and her conquerors, her changing dynasties and her\r\nshifting laws--sweeps over them and leaves them unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe village is self-contained. It is a complete organism, protoplastic\r\nit may be, with the chlorophyll of age colouring its institutions, but\r\nnone the less a perfect, living entity. It has within itself\r\neverything that its existence demands, and it has no ambition. The\r\ntorment of frustrated hope and of supersession is unknown in the\r\nvillage. We who are always striving to roll our prospects and our\r\noffice boxes up the hill to Simla may learn a lesson here:\r\n\r\n      Sisyphus in vita quoque nobis ante oculos est\r\n      Qui petere a populo fasces sævasque secures\r\n      Imbibit et semper victus tristisque recedit.\r\n      Nam petere imperium quod inanest nec datur umquam,\r\n      Atque in eo semper durum sufferre laborem,\r\n      Hoc est adverse nixantem trudere monte\r\n      Saxum quod tamen e summojam vertice rusum\r\n      Volvitur et plani raptim petit sequora campi.\r\n\r\nIn this idyllic existence, in which, as I have said, there is no\r\nambition, several other ills are also wanting. There is, for instance,\r\nno News in the village. The village is without the pale of\r\nintelligence. This must indeed be bliss. Just fancy, dear Vanity, a\r\nstate of existence in which there are no politics, no discoveries, no\r\ntravels, no speculations, no Garnet Wolseleys, no Gladstones, no\r\nCaptain Careys, no Sarah Bernhardts! If there be a heaven upon earth,\r\nit is surely here. Here no Press Commissioner sits on the hillside\r\ncroaking dreary translations from the St. Petersburg press; here no\r\n_Pioneer_ sings catches with Sir John Strachey in Council. But here\r\nthe lark sings in heaven for evermore, the sweet corn grows below, and\r\nthe villager, amid these quiet joys with which the earth fills her\r\nlap, dreams his low life.--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD COLONEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD COLONEL--\"Ripening for pension.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kwaihaipeglaoandjeldikaro\"--_Rigmarole Veda._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[November 15, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe old Indian Colonel ripening for pension on the shelf of General\r\nDuty is an object at once pitiful and ludicrous. His profession has\r\nebbed away from him, and he lies a melancholy derelict on the shore,\r\nwith sails flapping idly against the mast and meaningless pennants\r\nstreaming in the wind.\r\n\r\nHe has forgotten nearly everything he ever learnt of military duty,\r\nand what he has not forgotten has been changed. It is as much as he\r\ncan do to keep up with the most advanced thoughts of the Horse Guards\r\non buttons and gold lace. Yet he is still employed sometimes to turn\r\nout a guard, or to swear that \"the Service is going,\" &c.; and though\r\nhe has lost his nerve for riding, he has still a good seat on a\r\nboot-lace committee.\r\n\r\nHe is a very methodical old man. He rises at an early hour, strolls\r\ndown to the club on the Mall--perhaps the Wheler Club, perhaps some\r\nother--has his tea, newspaper, and gossip there, and then back to his\r\nsmall bungalow, [where he turns out his servants for swearing parade.\r\nEach one gets it pretty hot; and then breakfast]. After breakfast he\r\narrays himself for the day in some nondescript white uniform, and with\r\na forage cap stuck gaily on one side of his head, a cheroot in his\r\nmouth, and a large white umbrella in his hand, he again sallies forth\r\nto the Club. An old horse is led behind him.\r\n\r\nNow the serious business of life again begins--to get through the day.\r\nThere are six newspapers to read, twelve pegs to drink,\r\nfour-and-twenty Madras cheroots to smoke, there is kindly tiffin to\r\nlinger over, forty winks afterwards, a game of billiards, the band on\r\nthe Mall, dinner, and over all, incessant chatter, chatter, old\r\nscandal, old jokes, and old stories. Everyone likes the old Colonel,\r\nof course. Everyone says, \"Here comes poor old Smith; what an infernal\r\nbore he is!\" \"Hulloa, Colonel, how are you? glad to see you! what's\r\nthe news? how's exchange?\"\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel is not avaricious, but he saves money. He cannot help\r\nit. He has no tastes and he draws very large pay. His mind, therefore,\r\nbroods over questions relating to the investment of money, the\r\ndepreciation of silver, and the saving effected by purchasing things\r\nat co-operative stores. He never really solves any problem suggested\r\nby these topics. His mind is not prehensile like the tail of the\r\nApollo Bundar; everything eludes its grasp, so its pursuits are\r\nterminable. The old Colonel's cerebral caloric burns with a feeble\r\nflicker, like that of Madras secretariats, and never consumes a\r\nsubject. The same theme is always fresh fuel. You might say the same\r\nthing to him every morning, at the same hour till the crack of doom,\r\nand he would never recollect that he had heard your remark before.\r\nThis certainly must give a freshness to life and render eternity\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel is not naturally an indolent man, but the prominent\r\nfact about him is that he has nothing to do. If you gave him a\r\nsun-dial to take care of, or a rain-gauge to watch, or a secret to\r\nkeep, he would be quite delighted. I once asked Smith to keep a secret\r\nof mine, and the poor old fellow was so much afraid of losing it that\r\nin a few hours he had got everybody in the station helping him to keep\r\nit. It always surprises me that men with so much time on their hands\r\ndo not become Political Agents.\r\n\r\nSometimes our old Colonel gets into the flagitious habit of writing\r\nfor the newspapers. He talks himself into thinking that he possesses a\r\ngrievance, so he puts together a fasciculus of lop-sided sentences,\r\ngets the ideas set straight by the Doctor, the spelling refurbished\r\nby the Padré, and fires off the product to the _Delhi Gazette_\r\nor the _Himalayan Chronicle_. Then days of feverish excitement\r\nsupervene, hope alternating with fear. Will it appear? Will the\r\nCommander-in-Chief be offended? Will the Government of India be angry?\r\nWhat will the Service say?\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel is always rather suspicious of the great cocked-hats\r\nat head-quarters. He knows that to maintain an air of activity they\r\nmust still be changing something or abolishing something, and he is\r\nalways afraid that they will change or abolish him. But how could they\r\nchange the old Colonel? In a regiment he would be like Alice in\r\nWonderland; on the Staff he would be like old wine in a new bottle.\r\nThey might make him a K.C.B., it is true; but he does not belong to\r\nthe Simla Band of Hope, and stars must not be allowed to shoot madly\r\nfrom their sphere. As to abolishing the old Colonel, this too presents\r\nits difficulties, for Sir Norman Henry and all the celebrated\r\ncocked-hats at home and abroad look upon the Indian Staff Corps as\r\nPygmalion looked on his Venus. They dote on its lifeless charms, and\r\n(figuratively) love to clasp it in their foolish arms. [Now the old\r\nColonel is the trunk of this Frankenstein--to change the scene. So we\r\nmust not abolish the old Colonel.]\r\n\r\nIt is better to dress him up in an old red coat, and strap him on to\r\nan old sword with a brass scabbard, that he may stand up on high\r\nceremonials and drink the health of the good Queen for whom he has\r\nlived bravely through sunshine and stormy weather, in defiance of\r\nepidemics, retiring schemes and the Army Medical Department. It is\r\ngood to ask him to place his old knees under your hospitable board,\r\nand to fill him with wholesome wine, while he decants the mellow\r\nstories of an Anglo-India that is speedily dissolving from view.\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel has no harm in him; his scandal blows upon the\r\ngrandmothers of people that have passed away, and his little\r\nimproprieties are such as might illustrate a sermon of the present\r\nday. [A rabbit might play with him if there were no chutni lying\r\nabout.]\r\n\r\nBut you must never speak to him as if his sun were setting. He is as\r\nhopeful as a two-year-old. Every Gazette thrills him with vague\r\nexpectations and alarms. If he found himself in orders for a Brigade\r\nhe would be less surprised than anyone in the Army. He never ceases to\r\nhope that something may turn up--that something tangible may issue\r\nfrom the circumambient world of conjecture. But nothing will ever turn\r\nup for our poor old Colonel till his poor old toes turn up to the\r\ndaisies. This change only, which we harshly call \"Death,\" will steal\r\nover his prospects; this new slide only will be slipped into the magic\r\nlantern of his existence, accompanied by funeral drums and slow\r\nmarching.\r\n\r\nSoon we shall hardly be able to decipher his name and age on the\r\ncrumbling gravestone among the weeds of our horrible station\r\ncemetery--but what matters it?\r\n\r\n      \"For his bones are dust,\r\n      And his sword is rust,\r\n      And his soul is with the saints, we trust.\"\r\n\r\n                                                ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL SURGEON\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[November 22, 1879.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would hardly guess from his appearance and ways that he\r\nwas a surgeon and a medicine-man. He certainly does not smell of\r\nlavender or peppermint, or display fine and curious linen, or tread\r\nsoftly like a cat. Contrariwise.\r\n\r\nHe smells of tobacco, and wears flannel underclothing. His step is\r\nheavy. He is a gross, big cow-buffalo sort of man, with a tangled\r\ngrowth of beard. His ranting voice and loud familiar manner amount to\r\nan outrage. He laughs like a camel, with deep bubbling noises. Thick\r\ncorduroy breeches and gaiters swaddle his shapeless legs, and he rides\r\na coarse-bred Waler mare.\r\n\r\nI pray the gods that he may never be required to operate upon my eyes,\r\nor intestines, or any other delicate organ--that he may never be\r\nrequired to trephine my skull, or remove the roof of my mouth.\r\n\r\nOf course he is a very good fellow. He walks straight into your\r\ndrawing-room with a pipe in his mouth, bellowing out your name. No\r\nservant announces his arrival. He tramples in and crushes himself into\r\na chair, without removing his hat, or performing any other high\r\nceremonial. He has been riding in the sun, and is in a state of\r\nprofuse perspiration; you will have to bring him round with the\r\nnational beverage of Anglo-India, a brandy-and-soda.\r\n\r\nNow he will enter upon your case. \"Well, you're looking very blooming;\r\nwhat the devil is the matter with you? Eh? Eh? Want a trip to the\r\nhills? Eh? Eh? How is the bay pony? Eh? Have you seen Smith's new\r\nfilly? Eh?\"\r\n\r\nThis is very cheerful and reassuring if you are a healthy man with\r\nsome large conspicuous disease--a broken rib, cholera, or toothache;\r\nbut if you are a fine, delicately-made man, pregnant with poetry as\r\nthe egg of the nightingale is pregnant with music, and throbbing with\r\nan exquisite nervous sensibility, perhaps languishing under some vague\r\nand occult disease, of which you are only conscious in moments of\r\nintense introspection, this mode of approaching the diagnosis is apt\r\nto give your system a shock.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it may be bracing, like the inclement north wind. But,\r\nspeaking for myself, it has proved most ruinous and disastrous. Since\r\nI have known the Doctor my constitution has broken up. I am a wreck.\r\nThere is hardly a single drug in the whole pharmacopoeia that I can\r\ntake with any pleasure, and I have entirely lost sight of a most\r\ninteresting and curious complaint.\r\n\r\nYou see, dear Vanity, that I don't mince matters. I take our Doctor as\r\nI find him, rough and allopathic; but I am sure he might be improved\r\nin the course of two or three generations. We may leave this, however,\r\nto Nature and the Army Medical Department. Reform is not my business.\r\nI have no proposals to offer that will accelerate the progress of the\r\nDoctor towards a higher type.\r\n\r\nHappily his surgical and medicinal functions claim only a portion of\r\nhis time. He is in charge of the district gaol, a large and\r\ncomfortable retreat for criminals. Here he is admirable. To some eight\r\nor nine hundred murderers, robbers, and inferior delinquents he plays\r\nthe part of _maître d'hôtel_ with infinite success. In the whole\r\ncountry side you will not find a community so well bathed, dressed,\r\nexercised, fed and lodged as that over which the Doctor presides. You\r\nobserve on every face a quiet, Quakerish air of contentment. Every\r\ninmate of the gaol seems to think that he has now found a haven of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n      If the sea-horse on the ocean\r\n        Own no dear domestic cave,\r\n      Yet he slumbers without motion\r\n        On the still and halcyon wave;\r\n      If on rainy days the loafer\r\n        Gamble when he cannot roam,\r\n      The police will help him so far\r\n        As to find him here a home.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a quiet refuge for world-wearied men; a sanctuary\r\nundisturbed by the fears of the weak or the passions of the strong.\r\nAll reasonable wants are gratified here; nothing is hoped for any\r\nmore. The poor burglar burdened with unsaleable \"grab\" and the\r\nreproaches of a venal world sorrowfully seeks an asylum here. He\r\nbrings nothing in his hand; he seeks nothing but rest. He whispers\r\nthrough the key-hole--\r\n\r\n\r\n              Nil cupientium\r\n      Nudus castra peto.\r\n\r\nLook at this prisoner slumbering peacefully beside his _huqqa_ under\r\nthe suggestive bottle tree (there is something touching in his\r\nselecting the shade of a _bottle_ tree: Horace clearly had no _bottle_\r\ntree; or he would never have lain under a strawberry (and cream)\r\ntree). You can see that he has been softly nurtured. What a sleek,\r\nsturdy fellow he is! He is a covenanted servant here, having passed an\r\nexamination in gang robbery accompanied by violence and prevarication.\r\nHe cannot be discharged under a long term of years. Uncovenanted\r\npilferers, in for a week, regard him with respect and envy. And\r\ncertainly his lot is enviable; he has no cares, no anxieties. Famine\r\nand the depreciation of silver are nothing to him. Rain or sunshine,\r\nhe lives in plenty. His days are spent in an innocent round of duties,\r\nrelieved by sleep and contemplation of [Greek: to on]. In the long\r\nheats of summer he whiles away the time with carpet-making; between\r\nthe showers of autumn he digs, like our first parents, in the Doctor's\r\ngarden; and in winter, as there is no billiard-table, he takes a turn\r\non the treadmill with his mates. Perhaps, as he does so, he recites\r\nCharles Lamb's Pindaric ode:--\r\n\r\n                             Great mill!\r\n      That by thy motion proper\r\n      (No thanks to wind or sail, or toiling rill)\r\n      Grinding that stubborn-corn, the human will,\r\n      Turn'st out men's consciences,\r\n      That were begrimed before, as clean and sweet\r\n      As flour from purest wheat,\r\n      Into thy hopper.\r\n\r\nYet sometimes a murmur rises like a summer zephyr even from the soft\r\nlap of luxury and ease. Even the hardened criminal, dandled on the\r\nknee of a patriarchal Government, will sometimes complain and try to\r\ngive the Doctor trouble. But the Doctor has a specific--a brief\r\nincantation that allays every species of inflammatory discontent.\r\n\"Look here, my man! If I hear any more of this infernal nonsense, I'll\r\nturn you out of the gaol neck and crop.\" This is a threat that never\r\nfails to produce the desired effect. To be expelled from gaol and\r\ndriven, like Cain, into the rude and wicked world, a wanderer, an\r\noutcast--this would indeed be a cruel ban. Before such a presentiment\r\nthe well-ordered mind of the criminal recoils with horror.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Surgeon is also a rain doctor, and takes charge of the\r\nImperial gauge. If a pint more or a pint less than usual falls, he at\r\nonce telegraphs this priceless gossip to the Press Commissioner,\r\nOracle Grotto, Delphi, Elysium. This is one of our precautions to\r\nguard against famine. Mr. Caird is the other.\r\n\r\n[I was once in a very small station where our Civil Surgeon was an\r\nEurasian. He was a pompous little fellow, but a capital doctor,\r\ngaoler, and metereologist.\r\n\r\n      \"Omnis Aristippum decint, color et status, et res.\"\r\n\r\nWe liked him so much that we all got ill; crime increased, the gaol\r\nfilled, and no one ever passed the rain-gauge without either emptying\r\nit or pouring in a brandy-and-soda. With women and children he was a\r\ngreat favourite; for he had not become brutalised by familiarity with\r\nsuffering in hospitals. His heart was still tender, his voice soft,\r\nand he had a gentle way with his hands. I never knew anyone who was so\r\nunwilling to inflict pain; yet he was not unnerved when it had to be\r\ndone. But, poor little physician! he was not able to cure himself when\r\nfever laid her hot hand on him. He tried to go on with his work and\r\nlive it down; but the recuperative forces of Nature were weak within\r\nhim, and he died. \"The good die first, and those whose hearts are dry\r\nas summer dust burn to the socket.\" Our cow-buffalo doctor is still\r\nalive, I fear.]--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIKARRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[November 29, 1879.]\r\n\r\nI have come out to spend a day in the jungle with him, to see him play\r\non his own stage. His little flock of white tents has flown many a\r\nmarch to meet me, and have now alighted at this accessible spot near a\r\npoor hamlet on the verge of cultivation. I feel that I have only to\r\nyield myself for a few days to its hospitable importunities and it\r\nwill waft me away to profound forest depths, to the awful penetralia\r\nof the bison and the tiger. Even here everything is strange to me; the\r\ncommon native has become a Bheel, the sparrowhawk an eagle, the grass\r\nof the field a vast, reedy growth in which an elephant becomes a mere\r\nfield mouse. Out of the leaves come strange bird-notes, a strange\r\nsilence broods over us; it is broken by strange rustlings and cries;\r\nit closes over us again strangely. Nature swoons in its glory of\r\nsunshine and weird music; it has put forth its powers in colossal\r\ntimber and howling beasts of prey; it faints amid little wild flowers,\r\nfanned by breezes and butterflies.\r\n\r\nMy heart beats in strange anapæsts. This dream world of leaf and bird\r\nstirs the blood with a strange enchantment. The Spirit of Nature\r\ntouches us with her caduceus:--\r\n\r\n      Fair are others, none behold thee;\r\n      But thy voice sounds low and tender\r\n      Like the fairest, for it folds thee\r\n      From the sight, that liquid splendour;\r\n      And all feel, yet see thee never,\r\n      As I feel now ....\r\n\r\nOur tents are played upon by the flickering shadows of the vast\r\npipal-tree that rises in a laocoön tortuosity of roots out of an old\r\nwell. The spot is cool and pleasant. Round us are picketed elephants,\r\ncamels, bullocks, and horses, all enjoying the shade. Our servants are\r\ncooking their food on the precincts; each is busy in front of his own\r\nlittle mud fireplace. On a larger altar greater sacrifices are being\r\noffered up for our breakfast. A crowd of nearly naked Bheels watch the\r\nrites and snuff the fragrant incense of venison from a respectable\r\ndistance. Their leader, a broken-looking old man, with hardly a rag\r\non, stands apart exchanging deep confidences with my friend the\r\nShikarry. This old Bheel is girt about the loins with knives, pouches,\r\npowder-horns, and ramrods; and he carries on his shoulder an aged\r\nflintlock. He looks old enough to be an English General Officer or a\r\nCabinet Minister; and you might assume that he was in the last stage\r\nof physical and mental decay. But you would be quite wrong. This old\r\nBheel will sit up all night on the branch of a tree among the horned\r\nowls; he will see the tiger kill the young buffalo tied up as a bait\r\nbeneath; he will see it drink the life-blood and tear the haunch; he\r\nwill watch it steal away and hide under the _karaunda_ bush; he will\r\nsit there till day breaks, when he will creep under the thorn jungle,\r\nacross the stream, up the scarp of the ravine, through the long grass\r\nto the sahib's camp, and give the word that makes the hunter's heart\r\ndance. From the camp he will stride from hamlet to hamlet till he has\r\nraised an army of beaters; and he will be back at the camp with his\r\nforces before the sahib has breakfasted. Through the long heats of the\r\nday he will be the life and soul of the hunt, urging on the beaters\r\nwith voice and example, climbing trees, peeping under bushes, carrying\r\norders, giving advice, changing the line, until that supreme moment\r\nwhen shots are fired, when the rasping growl tells that the shots have\r\ntaken effect, and when at length the huge cat lies stretched out dead.\r\nAnd all this on a handful of parched grain!\r\n\r\n                    [Is this nothing?\r\n      Why then the world, and all that's in't, is nothing;\r\n      The covering sky is nothing, Ali Baba's nothing.]\r\n\r\nMy friend the Shikarry delights to clothe himself in the coarse\r\nfabrics manufactured in gaol, which, when properly patched and\r\ndecorated with pockets, have undoubtedly a certain wild-wood\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAs the hunter does not happen to be a Bheel with the privileges of\r\nnakedness conferred by a brown skin, this is perhaps the only\r\npractical alternative. If he went out to shoot in evening clothes, a\r\ncrush hat, and a hansom cab, the chances are that he would make an\r\nexample of himself and come to some untimely end. What would the\r\nApollo Bundar say? What would the Bengali Baboo say? What would the\r\nsea-aye-ees say? Yes, our hunter affects coarse and snuffy clothes;\r\nthey carry with them suggestions of hardship and roughing it; and his\r\nhat is umbrageous and old.\r\n\r\nAs to the man under the hat, he is an odd compound of vanity,\r\nsentiment, and generosity. He is as affected as a girl. Among other\r\ntraits he affects reticence, and he will not tell me what the plans\r\nfor the day are, or what _khabbar_[W] has been received. Knowing\r\nabsolutely nothing, he moves about with a solemn and important air,\r\n[as if six months gone with a _bandobast_[X]]; and he says to me,\r\n\"Don't fret yourself my dear fellow; you'll know all about it time\r\nenough. I have made arrangements.\" Then he dissembles and talks of\r\nirrelevant topics transcendentally. This makes me feel such a poor\r\npen-and-ink fellow, such a worm, such a [Famine-commissioner, such a]\r\nPolitical Agent!\r\n\r\nWith this discordant note still vibrating we go in to breakfast; and\r\nthen, dear Vanity, he _bucks_ with a quiet, stubborn determination\r\nthat would fill an American editor or an Under-Secretary of State with\r\ndespair. [His lies are really that awful (as the Press Commissioner\r\nwould say) which you couldn't tell as what he was joking, or\r\ninebriated, or drawing your leg.] He belongs to the twelve-foot-tiger\r\nschool; so, perhaps, he can't help it.\r\n\r\nIf the whole truth were told, he is a warm-hearted, generous, plucky\r\nfellow, with boundless vanity and a romantic vein of maudlin sentiment\r\nthat seduces him from time to time into the gin-and-water corner of an\r\nIndian newspaper. Under the heading of \"The Forest Ranger's Lament,\"\r\nor \"The Old Shikarry's Tale of Woe,\" he hiccoughs his column of sickly\r\nlines (with St. Vitus's dance in their feet), and then I believe he\r\nfeels better. I have seen him do it; I have caught him in criminal\r\nconversation with a pen and a sheet of paper; bottle at hand--\r\n\r\n        A quo, ceu fonte perenni,\r\n      Vatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis.\r\n\r\nIn appearance he is a very short man with a long black beard, a\r\nsunburnt face, and a clay pipe. He has shot battalions of tigers and\r\nspeared squadrons of wild pig. He is universally loved, universally\r\nadmired, and universally laughed at.\r\n\r\nHe is generous to a fault. All the young fellows for miles round owe\r\nhim money. He would think there was something wrong if they did not\r\nborrow from him; and yet, somehow, I don't think that he is very well\r\noff. There is nothing in his bungalow but guns, spears, and hunting\r\ntrophies; he never goes home, and I have an idea that there is some\r\nheavy drain on his purse in the old country. But you should hear him\r\ntroll a hunting song with his grand organ voice, and you would fancy\r\nhim the richest man in the world, his note is so high and triumphant!\r\n\r\n      So when in after days we boast\r\n        Of many wild boars slain,\r\n      We'll not forget our runs to toast\r\n        Or run them o'er again;\r\n\r\n      And when our memory's mirror true\r\n        Reflects the scenes of yore,\r\n      We'll think of _him_ it brings to view,\r\n        Who loved to hunt the boar.\r\n\r\n                                     ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRASS-WIDOW IN NEPHELOCOCCYGIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRASS WIDOW--\"Sweet little Mrs. Lollipop.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer bosom's lord sits lightly on his throne?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[December 6, 1879]\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Lollipop has certainly proved a source of disappointment\r\nto her lady friends. They have watched her for three seasons going\r\nlightly and merrily through all the gaieties of Cloudland; they have\r\nlistened to the scandal of the cuckoos among the pine-trees and\r\nrhododendrons, but they have not caught her tripping. Oh, no, they\r\nwill never catch her tripping. She does not trip for their amusement:\r\nperhaps she trips it when they go on the light fantastic toe, but\r\nthere is no evidence; there is only a zephyr of conjecture, only the\r\nworld's low whisper not yet broken into storm--not yet.\r\n\r\nYes, she is a source of disappointment to them. They have noted her\r\npoints; her beauty has burned itself into their jealousy; her merry\r\nlaugh has fanned their scorn; her bountiful presence is an affront to\r\nthem, as is her ripe and lissom figure. They pronounce her morally\r\nunsound; they say her nature has a taint; they chill her popularity\r\nwith silent smiles of slow disparagement. But they have no\r\nparticulars; their slander is not concrete. It is an amorphous\r\naccusation, sweeping and vague, spleen-born and proofless.\r\n\r\nShe certainly knows how to dress. Her weeds sit easily and smoothly on\r\ntheir delightful mould. You might think of her as a sweet, warm statue\r\npainted in water-colours. (Who wouldn't be her Pygmalion?) If she adds\r\na garment it is an improvement; if she removes a garment it is an\r\nimprovement; if she dresses her hair it is better; if she lets it fall\r\nin a brown cascade over her white shoulders it is still better; when\r\nit is yet in curl-papers it is charming. If you smudge the tip of her\r\nnose with a burnt cork the effect is irresistible; if you stick a\r\nflower in her hair it is a fancy dress, a complete costume--she\r\nbecomes Flora, Aurora, anything you like to name. Yet I have never\r\nclothed her in a flower, I have never smudged her nose with a burnt\r\ncork, I have never uncurled her hair. Ali Baba's character must not go\r\ndrifting down the stream of gossip with the Hill Captains and the\r\nUnder-Secretaries. But I hope that this does not destroy the argument.\r\nThe argument is that she is quite too delightful, and therefore blown\r\nupon by poisonous whispers.\r\n\r\nHer bungalow is an Elysium, of course; it is a cottage with a\r\nverandah, built on a steep slope, and buried deep in shrubbery and\r\ntrees. Within all is plain, but exquisitely neat. A wood fire is\r\nburning gaily, and the kindly tea-tray is at hand. It is five o'clock.\r\nClean servants move silently about with hot water, cake, &c. The\r\nlittle boy, a hostage from papa in the warm plains below, is sitting\r\npensive, after the fashion of Anglo-Indian children, in a little\r\nchair. His bearer crouches behind him. The unspeakable widow, in a\r\ntea-gown dimly splendid with tropical vegetation in neutral tints,\r\nholds a piece of chocolate in her hand, while she leans back in her\r\nfauteuil convulsed with laughter. (It is not necessary to say that Ali\r\nBaba is relating one of his improving tales.) How pretty she looks,\r\nshowing her excellent teeth and suffused with bright warm blushes,\r\n[which, I beg leave to explain, proceed from drinking hot tea and\r\nindulging in immoderate laughter, not from listening to A.B.'s\r\nimproving tales!] As I gaze upon her with fond amazement, I murmur\r\nmechanically:--\r\n\r\n      Mine be a cot beside the hill;\r\n        A tea-pot's hum shall soothe my ear,\r\n      A widowy girl, that likes me still,\r\n        With many a smile shall linger near.\r\n\r\nI have been asked to write a philosophical minute on the mental and\r\nmoral condition of delightful Mrs. Lollipop's husband, who lives down\r\nin the plains. I have been requested by the Press Commissioner to\r\ninquire in Government fashion, with pen and ink, as to whether the\r\ncomplaisant proprietor of so many charms desires to have a recheat\r\nwinded in his forehead, and to hang his bugle in an invisible\r\nbaldrick; whether it is true in his case that Love's ear will hear the\r\nlowest cuckoo note, and that Love's perception of gossip is more soft\r\nand sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails. Towards all\r\nthese points I have directed my researches. I have resolved myself\r\ninto a Special Commission, and I have sat upon grass-widowers _in\r\ncamera_. If I sit a little longer a Report will be hatched, which, of\r\ncourse, I shall take to England, and when there I shall go to the\r\nplaces of amusement with the Famine Commission, and have rather a good\r\ntime of it. Already I can see, with that bright internal eye which\r\nrequires no limelight, grim Famine stalking about the Aquarium after\r\ndinner with a merry jest preening its wings on his lips.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this talk of country matters to do with little Mrs.\r\nLollipop? Absolutely nothing. She thinks no ill of herself. She is the\r\nmost charitable woman in the world. There is no veil of sin over her\r\neye; no cloud of suspicion darkens her forehead; no concealment feeds\r\nupon her damask cheek. Like Eve she goes about hand in hand with her\r\nfriends, in native innocence, relying on what she has of virtue. Sweet\r\nsimplicity! sweet confidence! My eagle quill shall not flutter these\r\ndoves.\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched her at a big dance? She takes possession of some\r\nlarge warrior who has lately arrived from the battle-fields of Umballa\r\nor Meerut, and she chaperones him about the rooms, staying him with\r\nflagons and prattling low nothings. The weaker vessel jibs a little at\r\nfirst; but gradually the spell begins to work and the love-light\r\nkindles in his eye. He dances, he makes a joke, he tells a story, he\r\nturns round and looks her in the face. He is lost. That big centurion\r\nis a casualty; and no one pities him. \"How can he go on like that,\r\nodious creature!\" say the withered wall-flowers, and the Hill Captains\r\nfume round, working out formulae to express his baseness. But he is\r\naway on the glorious mountains of vanity; the intoxicating atmosphere\r\nmakes life tingle in his blood; he is an [Greek: aerobataes], he no\r\nlonger treads the earth. In a few days Mrs. Lollipop will receive a\r\npost-card from the Colonel of her centurion's regiment.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS.\r\n\r\n      Lollipop, dic, per omnes\r\n      Te deos oro, Robinson cur properes amando\r\n      Perdere? cur apricum\r\n      Oderit campum, patiens pulveris atque solis.\r\n\r\n      Yrs. Sincy.\r\n\r\n                     HORACE FITZDOTTREL.\r\n\r\nTen to one an Archdeacon will be sent for to translate this. Ten to\r\none there is a shindy, ending in tea and tearful smiles; for she is\r\nbound to get a blowing up.\r\n\r\nAfter what I have written I suppose it would be superfluous to affirm\r\nwith oaths my irrefragable belief in Mrs. Lollipop's innocence; it\r\nwould be superfluous to deprecate the many-winged slanders that wound\r\nthis milk-white hind. If, however, by swearing, any of your readers\r\nthink I can be of service to her character, I hope they will let me\r\nknow. I have learnt a few oaths lately that I reckon will unsphere\r\nsome of the scandal-mongers of Nephelococcygia. I had my ear one\r\nmorning at the keyhole when the Army Commission was revising the\r\ncursing and swearing code for field service.--(Ah! these dear old\r\nGenerals, what depths of simplicity they disclose when they get by\r\nthemselves! I sometimes think that if I had my life to live over again\r\nI would keep a newspaper and become a really great General. I know\r\nsome five or six obscure aboriginal tribes that have never yet yielded\r\na single war or a single K.C.B.)\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression. I was maintaining the goodness of Mrs.\r\nLollipop--little Mrs. Lollipop! sweet little Mrs. Lollipop! I was\r\ngoing to say that she was far too good to be made the subject of\r\nwhisperings and innuendoes. Her virtue is of such a robust type that\r\neven a Divorce Court would sink back abashed before it, like a guilty\r\nthing surprised. Indeed, she often reminds me of Cæsar's wife.\r\n\r\nThe harpies of scandal protest that she dresses too low; that she\r\nexposes too freely the well-rounded charms of her black silk\r\nstockings; that she appears at fancy-dress balls picturesquely\r\nunclothed--in a word, that the public sees a little too much of little\r\nMrs. Lollipop; and that, in conversation with men, she nibbles at the\r\nforbidden apples of thought. But all this proves her innocence,\r\nsurely. She fears no danger, for she knows no sin. She cannot\r\nunderstand why she should hide anything from an admiring world. Why\r\nkeep her charms concealed from mortal eye, like roses that in deserts\r\nbloom and die? She often reminds me of Una in Hypocrisy's cell.\r\n\r\nI heard an old Gorgon ask one of Mrs. Lollipop's _clientèle_ the other\r\nday whether he would like to be Mrs. Lollipop's husband. \"No,\" he\r\nsaid, \"not her husband; I am not worthy to be her husband--\r\n\r\n      \"But I would be the necklace\r\n      And all day long to fall and rise\r\n      Upon her balmy bosom\r\n      With her laughter or her sighs;\r\n      And I would lie so light, so light,\r\n      I scarce should be unclasped at night.\"\r\n\r\nThat old Gorgon is now going through a course of hysterics under\r\nmedical and clerical advice. Her ears are in as bad a case as Lady\r\nMacbeth's hands. Hymns will not purge them.--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLING M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH LION RAMPANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[December 13, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThere is not a more fearful wild fowl than your travelling M.P. This\r\nunhappy creature, whose mind is a perfect blank regarding\r\n_Faujdari_[Y] and _Bandobast_,[Z] and who cannot distinguish the\r\nmolluscous Baboo from the osseous Pathan, will actually presume to\r\ndiscuss Indian subjects with you, unless strict precautions be taken.\r\n\r\nWhen I meet one of these loose M.P.'s ramping about I always cut his\r\nclaws at once. I say, \"Now, Mr. T.G., you must understand that,\r\naccording to my standard, you are a homunculus of the lowest type.\r\nThere is nothing I value a man for that you can do; there is nothing I\r\nconsider worth directing the human mind upon that you know. If you ask\r\nfor any information which I may deem it expedient to give to a person\r\nin your unfortunate position, well and good; but if you venture to\r\nargue with me, to express any opinion, to criticise anything I may be\r\ngood enough to say regarding India, or to quote any passage relating\r\nto Asia from the works of Burke, Cowper, Bright, or Fawcett, I will\r\nhand you over to Major Henderson for strangulation, I will cause your\r\nbody to be burnt by an Imperial Commission of sweepers, and I will\r\nmention your name in the _Pioneer_.\"\r\n\r\nIn dangerous cases, where a note-book is carried, your loose M.P. must\r\nbe made to reside within the pale of guarded conversation. If you are\r\nwise you will speak to him in the interrogative mood exclusively; and\r\nyou will treat his answers with contumelious laughter or disdainful\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after your M.P. has landed in India he will begin his\r\ngreat work on the history, literature, philosophy and social\r\ninstitutions of the Hindoos. You will see him in a railway carriage\r\nwhen stirred by the [Greek: oistros] studying Forbes's Hindustani\r\nManual. He is undoubtedly writing the chapter on the philology of the\r\nAryan Family. Do you observe the fine frenzy that kindles behind his\r\nspectacles as he leans back and tries to eject a root? These pangs are\r\nworth about half-a-crown an hour in the present state of the book\r\nmarket. One cannot contemplate them without profound emotion.\r\n\r\nThe reading world is hunger-bitten about Asia, and I often think I\r\nshall take three months' leave and run up a _précis_ of Sanskrit and\r\nPali literature, just a few folios for the learned world. Max Müller\r\nbegs me to learn these languages first; but this would be a toil and\r\ndrudgery, whereas to me the pursuit of literary excellence and fame is\r\na mere amusement, like lawn-tennis or rinking. It is the fault of the\r\nage to make a labour of what is meant to be a pastime.\r\n\r\n      Telle est de nos plaisirs la surface légère;\r\n      Glissez, mortels, n'appuyez pas.\r\n\r\nThe travelling M.P. will probably come to you with a letter of\r\nintroduction from the last station he has visited, and he will\r\nimmediately proceed to make himself quite at home in your bungalow\r\nwith the easy manners of the Briton abroad. He will acquaint you with\r\nhis plans and name the places of interest in the neighbourhood which\r\nhe requires you to show him. He will ask you to take him, as a\r\npreliminary canter, to the gaol and lunatic asylum; and he will make\r\nmany interesting suggestions to the civil surgeon as to the management\r\nof these institutions, comparing them unfavourably with those he has\r\nvisited in other stations. He will then inspect the Brigadier-General\r\ncommanding the station, the chaplain, and the missionaries. On his\r\nreturn--when he ought to be bathing--he will probably write his\r\narticle for the _Twentieth Century_, entitled \"Is India Worth\r\nKeeping?\" And this ridiculous old Shrovetide cock, whose ignorance and\r\ninformation leave two broad streaks of laughter in his wake, is turned\r\nloose upon the reading public! Upon my word, I believe the reading\r\npublic would do better to go and sit at the feet of Baboo Sillabub\r\nThunder Gosht, B.A.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that these travelling people put on paper? Let me put it in\r\nthe form of a conundrum. _Q._ What is it that the travelling M.P.\r\ntreasures up and the Anglo-Indian hastens to throw away? _A._\r\nErroneous, hazy, distorted first impressions. Before the eyes of the\r\ngriffin, India steams up in poetical mists, illusive, fantastic,\r\nsubjective, ideal, picturesque. The adult _Qui Hai_ attains to prose,\r\nto stern and disappointing realities; he removes the gilt from the\r\nEmpire and penetrates to the brown ginger-bread of Rajas and Baboos.\r\nOne of the most serious duties attending a residence in India is the\r\ncorrecting of those misapprehensions which your travelling M.P.\r\nsacrifices his bath to hustle upon paper. The spectacled people\r\nembalmed in secretariats alone among Anglo-Indians continue to see the\r\ngay visions of griffinhood. They alone preserve the phantasmagoria of\r\nbookland and dreamland. As for the rest of us:--\r\n\r\n      Out of the day and night\r\n      A joy has taken flight:\r\n      Baboos and Rajas and Indian lore\r\n      Move our faint hearts with grief, but with delight\r\n      No more--oh, never more!\r\n\r\nIt is strange that one who is modest and inoffensive in his own\r\ncountry should immediately on leaving it exhibit some of the worst\r\nfeatures of Arryism; but it seems inevitable. I have met in this\r\nunhappy land, countrymen (who are gentlemen in England, Members of\r\nParliament, and Deputy Lieutenants, and that kind of thing) whose\r\nconduct and demeanour while here I can never recall without tears and\r\nblushes for our common humanity. My friends witnessing this emotion\r\noften suppose that I am thinking of the Famine Commission.\r\n\r\n[I am an Anglo-Indian cherishing many a burning Anglo-Indian\r\nprejudice, and I should be sorry if from what I have written here it\r\ndoes not sufficiently appear that I cherish a burning prejudice\r\nagainst the British Tourist in India, who comes out to get up India\r\nand to do India; not against the tourist who comes out to shoot or to\r\nplay the fool in a quiet unostentatious way.]\r\n\r\nAs far as I can learn, it is a generally received opinion at home that\r\na man who has seen the Taj at Agra, the Qutb at Delhi, and the Duke at\r\nMadras, has graduated with honours in all questions connected with\r\nBritish interests in Asia; and is only unfitted for the office of\r\nGovernor-General of India from knowing too much.--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEM-SAHIB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Her life is lone. He sits apart;\r\n        He loves her yet: she will not weep,\r\n        Tho' rapt in matters dark and deep\r\n      He seems to slight her simple heart.\r\n\r\n      \"For him she plays, to him she sings\r\n        Of early faith and plighted vows;\r\n        She knows but matters of the house,\r\n      And he, he knows a thousand things.\"\r\n\r\n[December 20, 1879.]\r\n\r\nI first met her shepherding her little flock across the ocean. She was\r\na beautiful woman, in the full sweetness and bloom of life. [The\r\nmystery of early wifehood and motherhood gave a pensiveness to her\r\nsoft eyes; but her voice and manner disclosed the cheerful confidence\r\nof perfect health and a pure heart.] Her talk was of the busy husband\r\nshe had left, the station life, the attached servants, the favourite\r\nhorse, the garden, and the bungalow. Her husband would soon follow\r\nher, in a year, or two years, and they would return together; but they\r\nwould return to a silent home--the children would be left behind. She\r\nwas going home to her mother and sisters; but there had been changes\r\nin this home. So her thoughts were woven of hopes and fears; and, as\r\nshe sat on deck of an evening, with the great heart of the moon-lit\r\nsea palpitating around us, and the homeless night-wind sighing through\r\nthe cordage, she would sing to us one of the plaintive ballads of the\r\nold country, till we forgot to listen to the sobbing and the trampling\r\nof the engines, and till all sights and sounds resolved themselves\r\ninto a temple of sentiment round a charming priestess chanting low\r\nanthems. She would leave us early to go to her babies. She would leave\r\nus throbbing with mock heroics, undecided whether we should cry, or\r\nconsecrate our lives to some high and noble enterprise, or drink one\r\nmore glass of hot whiskey-and-water. She was kind, but not\r\nsentimental; her sweet, yet practical \"good-night\" was quite of the\r\nwork-a-day world; we felt that it tended to dispel illusions.\r\n\r\nShe had three little boys, who were turned out three times a day in\r\nthe ultimate state of good behaviour, tidiness, and cleanliness, and\r\nwho lapsed three times a day into a state of original sin combined\r\nwith tar and ship's grease. These three little boys pervaded the\r\nvessel with an innocent smile on their three little faces, their\r\nmother's winning smile. Every man on the ship was their own familiar\r\nfriend, bound to them by little interchanges of biscuits, confidences,\r\ntwine, and by that electric smile which their mother communicated, and\r\nfrom which no one wished to be insulated. Yes, they quite pervaded the\r\nvessel, these three little innocents, flying that bright and friendly\r\nsmile; and there was no description of mischief suitable for three\r\nvery little boys that they did not exhaust. The ingenuity they\r\nsquandered every day in doing a hundred things which they ought not to\r\nhave done was perfectly marvellous. Before the voyage was half over we\r\nthought there was nothing left for them to do; but we were entirely\r\nmistaken. The daily round, a common cask would furnish all they had to\r\nask; to them the meanest whistle that blows, or a pocket-knife, could\r\ngive thoughts that too often led to smiles and tears.\r\n\r\nTheir mother's thoughts were ever with them; but she was like a hen\r\nwith a brood of ducklings. They passed out of her element, and only\r\nreturned as hunger called them. When they did return she was all that\r\nsoap and water, loving reproaches, and tender appeals could be; and as\r\nthey were very affectionate little boys, they were for the time\r\nthoroughly cleansed morally and physically, and sealed with the\r\nabsolution of kisses.\r\n\r\nI saw her three years afterwards in England. She was living in\r\nlodgings near a school which her boys attended. She looked careworn.\r\nHer relations had been kind to her, but not warmly affectionate. She\r\nhad been disappointed with the welcome they had given her. They seemed\r\nchanged to her, more formal, narrower, colder. She longed to be back\r\nin India; to be with her husband once more. But he was engrossed with\r\nhis work. He wrote short letters enclosing cheques; but he never said\r\nthat he missed her, that he longed to see her again, that she must\r\ncome out to him, or that he must go to her. He could not have grown\r\ncold too? No, he was busy; he had never been demonstrative in his\r\naffection; this was his way. And she was anxious about the boys. She\r\ndid not know whether they were really getting on, whether she was\r\ndoing the best for them, whether their father would be satisfied. She\r\nhad no friends near her, no one to speak to; so she brooded over these\r\nproblems, exaggerated them, and fretted.\r\n\r\nThe husband was a man who lived in his own thoughts, and his thoughts\r\nwere book thoughts. The world of leaf and bird, the circumambient\r\nfirmament of music and light, shone in upon him through books. A book\r\nwas the master key that unlocked all his senses, that unfolded the\r\nvaried landscape, animated the hero, painted the flower, swelled the\r\norchestra of wind and ocean, peopled the plains of India with\r\nstarvelings and the mountains of Afghanistan with cut-throats. Without\r\na book he moved about like a shadow lost in some dim dreamland of\r\nechoes.\r\n\r\nEveryone knew he was a scholar, and his thoughts had once or twice\r\nrung out to the world clear and loud as a trumpet-note through the\r\noracles of the Press. But in society he was shy, awkward, and uncouth\r\nof speech, quite unable to marshal his thoughts, deserted by his\r\nmemory, abashed before his own silences, and startled by his own\r\nwords. Any fool who could talk about the legs of a horse or the height\r\nof the thermometer was Prospero to this social Caliban.\r\n\r\nHe felt that before the fine instincts of women his infirmity was\r\nespecially conspicuous, and he drifted into misogyny through\r\nbashfulness and pride; and yet misogyny was incompatible with his\r\nscheme of life and his ambition. He felt himself to be worthy of the\r\nfull diapason of home life; he desired to be as other men were,\r\nbesides being something more.\r\n\r\n      [Greek: Kakon gynaikes all' homos, o daemotai,\r\n     Ouk estin oikein oikian aneu kakou.\r\n      Kai gar to gaemai, kai to mae gaemai, kakon.]\r\n\r\nSo he married her who loved him for choosing her, and who reverenced\r\nhim for his mysterious treasures of thought.\r\n\r\nThere was much in his life that she could never share: but he longed\r\nfor companionship in thought, and for the first year of their married\r\nlife he tried to introduce her to his world. He led her slowly up to\r\nthe quiet hill-tops of thought where the air is still and clear, and\r\nhe gave her to drink of the magic fountains of music. Their hearts\r\nbeat one delicious measure. Her gentle nature was plastic under the\r\npoet's touch, wrought in an instant to perfect harmony with love, or\r\ntears, or laughter. To read aloud to her in the evening after the\r\nday's work was over, and to see her stirred by every breath of the\r\nthought-storm, was to enjoy an exquisite interpretation of the poet's\r\nmotive, like an impression bold and sharp from the matrix of the\r\npoet's mind. This was to hear the song of the poet and Nature's low\r\necho. How tranquilising it was! How it effaced the petty vexations of\r\nthe day!--\"softening and concealing; and busy with a hand of healing.\"\r\n\r\n      Tale tuum carmen nobis, divine poeta,\r\n      Quale sopor fessis in gramine, quale per æstum\r\n      Dulcis aquæ saliente sitim restinguere rivo.\r\n\r\nBut with the advent of babies poetry declined, and the sympathetic\r\nwife became more and more motherly. The father retired sadly into the\r\ndreamland of books. He will not emerge again. Husband and wife will\r\nstand upon the clear hill-tops together no more.\r\n\r\nNeither quite knows what has happened; they both feel changed with an\r\nundefined sorrow, with a regret that pride will not enunciate. She is\r\nnow again in India with her husband. There are duties, courtesies,\r\nnay, kindnesses which both will perform, but the ghost of love and\r\nsympathy will only rise in their hearts to jibber in mockery words and\r\nphrases that have lost their meaning, that have lost their\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\n      \"O love! who bewailest\r\n        The frailty of all things here,\r\n      Why choose you the frailest\r\n        For your cradle, your home, and your bier?\r\n\r\n      \"Its passions will rock thee\r\n        As the storms rock the raven on high;\r\n      Bright reason will mock thee\r\n        Like the sun from a wintry sky.\r\n\r\n      \"From thy nest every rafter\r\n        Will rot, and thine eagle home\r\n      Leave thee naked to laughter\r\n        When leaves fall and cold winds come.\"\r\n\r\n                                              ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALI BABA ALONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Now the last of many days,\r\n        All beautiful and bright as thou,\r\n        The loveliest, and the last is dead,\r\n      Rise, memory, and write its praise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[December 27, 1879.]\r\n\r\nHow shall I lay this spectre of my own identity? Shall I leave it to\r\nmelt away gracefully in the light of setting suns? It would never do\r\nto put it out like a farthing rushlight after it had haunted the Great\r\nOrnamental in an aurora of smiles. Is Ali Baba to cease upon the\r\nmidnight without pain? or is he to lie down like a tired child and\r\nweep out the spark? or should he just flit to Elysium? There, seated\r\non Elysian lawns, browsed by none but Dian's (no allusion to little\r\nMrs. Lollipop) fawns, amid the noise of fountains wonderous and the\r\nparle of voices thunderous, some wag might scribble on his door, \"Here\r\nlies Ali Baba\"--as if glancing at his truthfulness. How is he to pass\r\neffectively into the golden silences? How is he to relapse into the\r\nstill-world of observation? Would four thousand five hundred a month\r\nand Simla do it, with nothing to do and allowances, and a seat beside\r\nthose littered under the swart Dog-Star of India? Or is it to be the\r\nmandragora of pension, that he may sleep out the great gap of _ennui_\r\nbetween this life and something better? How lonely the Government of\r\nIndia would feel! How the world would forget the Government of India!\r\nVoices would ask:--\r\n\r\n      Do ye sit there still in slumber\r\n        In gigantic Alpine rows?\r\n      The black poppies out of number\r\n        Nodding, dripping from your brows\r\n      To the red lees of your wine--\r\n      And so kept alive and fine.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think that Ali Baba should be satisfied with the\r\noblivion-mantle of knighthood and relapse into dingy respectability in\r\nthe Avilion of Brompton or Bath; but since he has taken to wearing\r\nstars the accompanying itch for blood and fame has come:--\r\n\r\n      How doth the greedy K.C.B.\r\n        Delight to brag and fight,\r\n      And gather medals all the day\r\n        And wear them all the night.\r\n\r\nThe fear of being out-medalled and out-starred stings him:--\r\n\r\n      [Consimili ratione ab eodem sæpe timore\r\n      Macerat invidia, ante oculos ilium esse polentem,\r\n      Illum aspectari, claro qui incedit honore,\r\n      Ipsi se in tenebris volvi cænoque queruntur\r\n      Insereunt partim statuarum et nominis ergo.]\r\n\r\nThus the desire to go hustling up the hill to the Temple of Fame with\r\nthe other starry hosts impels him forward. If you mix yourself up with\r\nK.C.B.'s and raise your platform of ambition, you are just where you\r\nwere at the A B C of your career. Living on a table-land, you\r\nexperience no sensation of height. For the intoxicating delights of\r\nelevation you require a solitary pinnacle, some lonely eminence. Aut\r\nCæsar, aut nullus; whether in the zenith or the Nadir of the world's\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nBut how much more comfortable in the cold season than the chill\r\nsplendours of the pinnacles of fame, where \"pale suns unfelt at\r\ndistance roll away,\" is a comfortable bungalow on the plains, with a\r\nlittle mulled claret after dinner. Here I think Ali Baba will be\r\nfound, hidden from his creditors, the reading world, in the warm light\r\nof thought, singing songs unbidden till a few select cronies are\r\nwrought to sympathy with hopes and fears they heeded not--before the\r\nmulled claret.\r\n\r\nTo this symposium the A.-D.-C.-in-Waiting has invited himself on\r\nbehalf of the Empire. He will sing the Imperial Anthem composed by Mr.\r\nEastwick, and it will be translated into archaic Persian by an\r\nimperial Munshi for the benefit of the Man in Buckram, who will be\r\npresent. The Man in Buckram, who is suffering from a cold in his\r\nheart, will be wrapped up in himself and a cocked hat. The Press\r\nCommissioner has also asked for an invitation. He will deliver a\r\nsentiment:--\"Quid sit futurum eras fuge quærere.\" A Commander-in-Chief\r\nwill tell the old story about the Service going to the dogs; after\r\nwhich there will be an interval of ten minutes allowed for swearing\r\nand hiccuping. The Travelling M.P. will take the opportunity to jot\r\ndown a few hasty notes on Aryan characteristics for the _Twentieth\r\nCentury_ before being placed under the table. The Baboo will\r\nsubsequently be told off to sit on the Member's head. During this\r\nfunction the Baboo will deliver some sesquipedalian reflections in the\r\nrodomontade mood. The Shikarry will then tell the twelve-foot-tiger\r\nstory. Mrs. Lollipop will tell a fib and make tea; and Ali Baba\r\n(unless his heart is too full of mulled claret) will make a joke. The\r\ncompany will break up at this point, after receiving a plenary\r\ndispensation from the Archdeacon.\r\n\r\nUnder such influences Ali Baba may become serious; he may learn from\r\nthe wisdom of age and be cheered by the sallies of youth. But little\r\nMrs. Lollipop can hardly be called one of the Sallies of his youth.\r\nSally Lollipop rose upon the horizon of his middle age. She boiled up,\r\npure blanc-mange and roses, over the dark brim of life's afternoon, a\r\nblushing sunrise, though late to rise, and most cheerful. Sometimes\r\nafter spending an afternoon with her, Ali Baba feels so cheered that\r\nthe Government of India seems quite innocent and bright, like an old\r\nballerina seen through the mists of champagne and limelight. He walks\r\ndown the Mall smiling upon foolish Under Secretaries and fat Baboos.\r\nThe people whisper as he passes, \"There goes Ali Baba\"; and echo\r\nanswers \"Who is Ali Baba?\" Then a little wind of conjecture breathes\r\nthrough the pine-trees and names are heard.\r\n\r\nIt is better not to call Ali Baba names. Nothing is so misleading as a\r\nvulgar nomenclature. I once knew a man who was called \"Counsellor of\r\nthe Empress\" when he ought to have had his photograph exposed in the\r\nLondon shop-windows like King Cetewayo, K.C.M.G. I have heard an\r\neminent Frontier General called \"Judas Iscariot,\" and I myself was\r\nonce pointed out as a \"Famine Commissioner,\" and afterwards as an\r\nexpurgated edition of the Secretary to the Punjab Government. People\r\nseemed to think that Ali Baba would smell sweeter under some other\r\nname. This was a mistake.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything you are told in Simla is a mistake. You should never\r\nbelieve anything you hear till it is contradicted by the _Pioneer_. I\r\nsuppose the Government of India is the greatest _gobemouche_ in the\r\nworld. I suppose there never was an administration of equal importance\r\nwhich received so much information and which was so ill-informed. At a\r\nbureaucratic Simla dinner-party the abysses of ignorance that yawn\r\nbelow the company on every Indian topic are quite appalling!\r\n\r\nI once heard Mr. Stokes say that he had never heard of my book on the\r\nPermanent Settlement; and yet Mr. Stokes is a decidedly intelligent\r\nman, with some knowledge of Cymric and law. I daresay now if you were\r\nto draw off and decant the law on his brain, it would amount to a full\r\ndose for an adult; yet he never heard of my book on the Permanent\r\nSettlement. He knew about Blackstone; he had seen an old copy once in\r\na second-hand book shop; but he had never heard of my work! How\r\nloosely the world floats around us! I question its objective reality.\r\nI doubt whether anything has more objectivity in it than Ali Baba\r\nhimself. He was certainly flogged at school. Yet when we now try to\r\nput our finger on Ali Baba he eludes the touch; when we try to lay him\r\nhe starts up gibbering at Cabul, Lahore, or elsewhere. Perhaps it is\r\neasier to imprison him in morocco boards and allow him to be blown\r\nwith restless violence round about the pendant world, abandoned to\r\ncritics: whom our lawless and uncertain thoughts imagine howling.\r\n\r\n[Ali Baba! I know not what thou art, but know that thou and I must\r\npart; and why or where and how we met, I own to me's a secret yet. Ali\r\nBaba, we've been long together through pleasant and through cloudy\r\nweather; 'tis hard to part when things are dear, bar silver, piece\r\ncloth, bottled beer, then steal away with this short warning: choose\r\nthine own winding-sheet, say not good-night here, but in some brighter\r\nbinding, sweet, bid me good morning.]--ALI BABA, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM _SERIOUS REFLECTIONS AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS_.\r\n\r\nBY \"OUR POLITICAL ORPHAN.\"\r\n\r\n_The Bombay Gazette Press_, 1881.\r\n\r\nNo. XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEAPOT SERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL DISSECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[January 5, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOSSIP I.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. SMITH,\r\n\r\nI cannot understand why Mrs. Smith, with her absurd figure--for really\r\nI can apply no other adjective to it--should wear that most absurdly\r\ntight dress. Some one should tell her what a fright it makes of her.\r\nShe is nothing but convexities. She looks exactly like an hour-glass,\r\nor a sodawater machine. At a little distance you can hardly tell\r\nwhether she is coming to you, or going away from you. She looks just\r\nthe same all round. People call her smile sweet; but then it is the\r\nmere sweetness of inanity. It is the blank brightness of an empty\r\nchamber. She sheds these smiles upon everyone and everything, and they\r\nare felt to be cold like moonshine. Speaking for myself, these\r\n_eau-sucré_ smiles could not suckle my love. I would languish upon\r\nthem. My love demands stronger drink. Mrs. Smith's features are good,\r\nno doubt. Her eyes are good. An oculist would be satisfied with them.\r\nThey have a cornea, a crystalline lens, a retina, and so on, and she\r\ncan see with them. This is all very satisfactory, I do not deny, as\r\nfar as it goes. Physiologically her eyes are admirable; but for\r\npoetry, for love, or even for flirting, they are useless. There is no\r\nsignificance in them, no witchery, no suggestiveness. The aurora of\r\nbeautiful far-away thoughts does not coruscate in them. Her eyelids\r\nconceal them, but do not quench them. They would be nothing for\r\nwinking, or tears. If she winked at me, I should not jump into the\r\nair, as if shot in the spine, with my blood tingling to my\r\nextremities; my heart would not beat like a side-drum; my blushes\r\nwould not come perspiring through my whiskers. Her winking would\r\naltogether misfire. Why? Because her winking would be physiological\r\nand not erotic. If you ever learnt to love her, it would not be for\r\nany lovelight in her eye; it would never be the quick, fierce, hot,\r\nbiting electric passion of the fleshly poets, it would be what a\r\nchemist might call the \"eremacausis\" kindled by habit. Mrs. Smith's\r\ntears are quite the poorest product of the lachrymal glands I have\r\never seen. They are simply a form of water. They might dribble from an\r\neffete pump; they might leak from a worn-out _mashq_.[AA] I observe\r\nthem with pity and regret. Their drip has no echo in my bosom; it\r\nproduces no stalactites of sympathy in my heart.\r\n\r\nI have often been told that her nose was good--and good it\r\nunquestionably is--good for blowing; good for sneezing; good for\r\nsnoring; good for smelling; a fine nose for a catarrh. But who could\r\nplay with it? Who could tweak it passionately, as a prelude to\r\nkissing? Who could linger over it tenderly with a candle, or a lump of\r\nmutton fat, when cold had laid its cruel hand upon it? It is not\r\ntip-tilted like a flower; it is not whimsical with some ravishing and\r\nunexpected little crook. It is straight, like a mathematical line. But\r\nit has no parts. Her cheeks are round and fair. Each has its dimple\r\nand blush. They are thoroughly healthy, Mrs. Smith's digestion is\r\nunexceptionable. You might indicate the contour of these cheeks with a\r\npair of compasses; you might paint them with your thumb. Poor Mrs.\r\nSmith's talk, or babble rather, is of her husband, her children, her\r\nhome. It is a mere purring over them. She never cuts them to pieces,\r\nand holds them up to scorn and mockery. She never penetrates their\r\nweaknesses. She does not even understand that Smith is a common-place,\r\nstereotyped kind of fellow, exactly like hundreds of other men in his\r\nclass. She does not appear to notice the ghastly defects in his\r\neducation, tastes, and character, which gape before all the world\r\nelse. She does not see that he is without the _morbidezza_ of culture;\r\nthat he finds no _appogiatura_ in art; that he never rises at\r\nmidnight, amid lightning and rain, to emit an inarticulate cry of\r\næsthetic anguish in some metrical construction of the renaissance\r\nperiod. She does not miss in him that yearning after the unattainable,\r\nwhich in some mysterious wise fills us with a mute despair; which has\r\nin it yet I know not what of sweetness amid the delirious aspirations\r\nwith which it distracts us. She cannot know, with her base instincts\r\ndragging her down to the hearth-level of home and child, the material\r\ngracelessness of her husband, equally incapable of striking an\r\nAnglo-Saxon, or a mediæval attitude; and with his blood flushed,\r\nhealthy face unable to realize in his expression that divine sorrow\r\nwhich can alone distinguish the man of culture from ordinary\r\nEnglishmen, or the anthropoid apes. She will never know what vibrates\r\nso harshly on us--the want of feeling for colour which is displayed in\r\nthe coarse tone of his brown hair. So in regard to her children, the\r\nmind of Mrs. Smith is quite uncritical. Look at that baby, like a\r\nthousand other babies you see every day. It has not a single\r\nidiosyncrasy on which anyone above the intellectual level of a\r\n_crétin_ could hang an affection. Its porcine eyes twinkle dimly\r\nthrough rolls of fat; it splutters and puffs, and its habits are\r\nsimply abominable. What a gross home for that life's star, which hath\r\nhad elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar! The star is quenched\r\nin fat; it has exchanged the music of the spheres for a hideous\r\ncaterwauling! Yet Mrs. Smith loves that child, and gobbles over it,\r\ndescending to its abysses of grossness.\r\n\r\nHer house is one of many in a long unlovely street; it is furnished\r\naccording to the most corrupt dictates of bestial Philistinism--that\r\nis, with a view to comfort. There are no subtle harmonies in the\r\npapers and chintzes; there are no hidden suggestions of form and tone\r\nin the cornices and bell handles; all is barren of proportion,\r\nconcord, and meaning. Still, this poor woman, with her inartistic eye\r\nand foolish heart, loves this wretched shelter, and would pour out her\r\nidiotic tears if she were leaving it for Paradise.\r\n\r\nBut if we descend from our aesthetic heights to the lowly level of the\r\nbiped Smith, we may see Mrs. S. in a totally different atmosphere, and\r\ncertain lights and shadows will play about her with a radiance not\r\naltogether without beauty. She is a single-minded woman, anxious to\r\nmake her husband and children comfortable and happy in their\r\nhome,--and dreaming of nothing beyond this. She is full of homely\r\nwisdom; a hundred little economies she practises with forethought and\r\nunwearying assiduity tend to make her husband and children love her\r\nand regard her as a paragon of domestic policy. Her husband's\r\naffection and her children's affection are all the world to her; music\r\nand painting and poetry, Mr. Ruskin, Phidias, Praxiteles, Holman Hunt,\r\nand Mr. Whistler pale away into shadows of shadows in presence of the\r\nindications of love she receives from that baby. And this intense\r\nsingle-minded love elevates her within its own compass. She sees in\r\nthat baby's eyes the light that never was on sea or land, the\r\nconsecration and the mother's dream. She broods over it till she\r\neffects for it in her own maternal fancy an apotheosis; and round its\r\nimage in her heart there glows a bright halo of poetry. She sees\r\nthrough the fat. The grossness disappears before her rapt gaze. There\r\nremains the spirit from heaven:--\r\n\r\n      Sweet spirit newly come from Heaven\r\n      With all the God upon thee, still\r\n      Beams of no earthly light are given\r\n      Thy heart e'en yet to bless and fill.\r\n      Thy soul a sky whose sun has set,\r\n      Wears glory hovering round it yet;\r\n      And childhood's eve glows sadly bright\r\n      Ere life hath deepened into night.\r\n\r\nSo with the husband; so with the home; a glory gathers round them,\r\nwhich she alone, the intense worshipper, sees; and this unæsthetic\r\nMrs. Smith, altogether unsatisfactory to the artistic eye, most\r\npractical, most commonplace, carries within her some of the Promethean\r\nflame, and is worthy of that halo of homely joy and affection with\r\nwhich she is crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAHIB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[February 19, 1880.]\r\n\r\nI first met him driving home from cutcherry in his buggy. He was a fat\r\nman in the early afternoon of life. In his blue eyes lay the mystery\r\nof many a secret salad and unwritten milk-punch; but though he smoked\r\nthe longest cheroots of Trichinopoly and Dindigul, his hand was still\r\nsteady and still grasped a cue or a long tumbler, with the unerring\r\ncertainty of early youth and unshaken health.\r\n\r\nOf an evening he would come over to my bungalow in a friendly way; he\r\nwould \"just drop in,\" as he used to say, in his pleasant offhand\r\nfashion, and he would irrigate himself with my brandy and soda, amid\r\ngenial smiles and a brandishing of his long cheroot, playfully\r\nindicating his recognition of a stimulant with which he had been long\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nAs he began to glow with conversation and brandy, he would call for\r\ncards and play écarté with me, until the room gradually resolved\r\nitself into one of the circles of some Californian Inferno, with a\r\nknave of spades digging the diamonds out of my heart and clubbing my\r\ntrumps.\r\n\r\nHe would leave me throbbing with the eructation of oaths and the\r\nhollow aching of an empty purse, and uncertain whether to give up\r\ncards and liquor for hymns and Government paper or whether to call him\r\nback and take fortune by storm. But he had gone off with a resolute\r\n\"good night\" that tended to dispel illusions; he had gone to his own\r\nNo. 1 Exshaw and his French novels, which he read as he lay on his\r\nsolitary bachelor couch.\r\n\r\nYes,--his bachelor couch, for he was not married. He had loved much\r\nand often. He had loved a great many people in different stations of\r\nlife, but they did not marry him. He was, upon the whole, glad that\r\nthey did not marry him; for they were often married to other people,\r\nand he would have been lonely with one, dissatisfied with two, and\r\nembarrassed with more; so he continued his austere bachelor life; and\r\nalways tried to love unostentatiously somebody else's wife.\r\n\r\nHe loved somebody else's wife, because he had no wife of his own, and\r\nthe heart requires love. It was very wrong of him to love somebody\r\nelse's wife, and to sponge thus on affections which belonged to\r\nanother; but then he had nothing puritanical or pharisaical in his\r\nnature; he was too highly cultivated to be moral, and arguing the\r\npoint in the mood of sweet _Barbara_, he had often succeeded in\r\npersuading pretty women that he did right in loving them, though their\r\nhousehold duties belonged to another.\r\n\r\nI have said that he was too highly cultivated to be religious. He was\r\nexceedingly emotional and intellectual; and the procrustean bed of a\r\ncreed would have been intolerable torture to him. Life throbbed around\r\nhim in an aurora of skittles. The world of morality only raised a\r\nlanguid smile, or tickled an appetite pleased with novelty. An\r\narchdeacon, or a book of sermons delighted him. He would play with\r\nthem and ponder over them, as if they were old china, or curious\r\netchings. But he was never profane, especially before bishops, or\r\nchildren, and he always went to church on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nHe went to church on Sunday morning, because it was quaint and\r\nold-fashioned to do so, and because he loved to see the women of his\r\nacquaintance in their devotional moods and attitudes. There was hardly\r\nany mood or attitude in which he did not love to see a woman, partly\r\nbecause he was full of human sympathy and tenderness, and partly for\r\nother reasons. I suppose he was a student of human nature, though he\r\nalways repudiated the notion of being a student of anything. He said\r\nthat life was too short for serious study, and that every kind of\r\npursuit should be tempered with fooling; while to prevent fooling\r\nbecoming wearisome it should always be dashed with something earnest,\r\nas the sodawater is dashed with brandy, or the Government of India\r\nwith Mr. Whitley Stokes.\r\n\r\n      Nigrorum memor, dum licet, ignium,\r\n      Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem:\r\n      Dulce est desipere in loco.\r\n\r\nBut besides being a man of pleasure and a capital billiard player, he\r\nwas a Collector in the North-Western Provinces--a man who sat at the\r\nreceipt of custom under a punkah, and read his _Pioneer_. The Lord\r\nHigh Cockalorum at Nynee Tal, Sir Somebody Thingmajig,--I am speaking\r\nof years ago--did not like him, I believe; but nobody thought any the\r\nworse of him for this; and although he continued to be a Collector\r\nuntil the shades of evening, when all his contemporaries had retired\r\ninto the Dreamland of Commissionerships, he still loved and was loved;\r\nand to the very last he read his French novels and quoted Horace,\r\nsitting peacefully on the bank while the stream of promotion rolled\r\non, knowing well that it would roll on _in omne ævum_, and not caring\r\na jot whether it did, or did not. What was a seat at the Sadr\r\nBoard[BB] to him, a seat among the solemn mummies of the service? He\r\nwould not object to lie in the same graveyard with them; but to sit at\r\nthe same board while this sensible warm motion of life still continued\r\nwas too much; this could never be. He belonged to a higher order of\r\nspirits. As a boy he had not bartered the music of his soul for\r\nEastern languages and the Rent Law; and as an old man he would not sit\r\nin state with corpses faintly animated by rupees.\r\n\r\nTo the last he mocked promotion; he mocked, till the dread mocker laid\r\nmocking fingers on his liver, and till gibe and laughter were silenced\r\nfor evermore. So the Collector died, the merry Collector; and \"where\r\nshall we bury the merry Collector?\" became the last problem for his\r\nfriends to deal with. I was in far away lands at the time with another\r\nfriend of his--we mourned for the Collector.\r\n\r\nWe would have buried him in soft summer weather under sweet arbute\r\ntrees, near the shore of some murmuring Italian sea. The west wind\r\nshould whisper its grief over his grave for ever:--\r\n\r\n      \"Thou who didst waken from his summer-dreams\r\n      The blue Mediterranean, where he lay\r\n      Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams,\r\n      Beside a pumice isle in Baiæ's bay,\r\n      And saw in sleep old palaces and towers\r\n      Quivering within the wave's intenser day,\r\n      All overgrown with azure moss and flowers.\"\r\n\r\nBlue-eyed girls have bound his dear head with garlands of the amorous\r\nrosemary. The echoes of sea-caves would have chanted requiems until\r\ntime should be no more. Embalmed in darkness the nightingale would\r\nnightly for ever pour forth her soul in profuse strains of\r\ninconsolable ecstasy; by day the dove should moan in the flickering\r\nshade until the sun should cease to roll on his fiery path:--\r\n\r\n      \"Where through groves deep and high,\r\n      Sounds the far billow,\r\n      Where early violets die under the willow.\r\n      There, through the summer day,\r\n      Cool streams are laving;\r\n      There, while the tempests sway,\r\n      Scarce are boughs waving;\r\n      There thy rest should'st thou take,\r\n      Parted for ever,\r\n      Never again to wake: never, O never!\"\r\n\r\nWith tender hand we would have traced on his memorial urn some\r\nvalediction--not without hope--of love and friendship.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise. He was buried during a dust-storm in a loathsome\r\nIndian cemetery. No friend stood by the grave. A hard priest\r\nreluctantly pattered an abbreviated service: and people whispered that\r\nit was not well with the Collector's soul. He is now forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut, dear friend, thy memory blossoms in my heart for ever, thy merry\r\nlaugh will still sound in my ear:--\r\n\r\n      \"Abiding with me till I sail\r\n      To seek thee on the mystic deeps,\r\n      And this electric force, that keeps\r\n      A thousand pulses dancing, fail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRYPHON'S ANABASIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[March 29, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some days the moustaches had been assuming a fiercer curl; more\r\nand more troopers had been added to the escort; the Lord whispered in\r\nthe unreluctant ear softer and softer nothings; the scarlet runners\r\nbowed lower and lower; and it was rumoured that the Lord had given the\r\nGryphon a pot of his own club-mutton hair-grease. It would be a halo.\r\nThis development of glory must have a limit: a feeling got abroad that\r\nthe Gryphon must go.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief would come up to him bathed in smiles and say\r\nnothing; at other times with tears in his eyes he would swear with far\r\nresounding, multitudinous oaths to accompany the Gryphon. One day\r\nWolseley's pocket-book and a tooth-brush would be packed in tin; next\r\nday they would be unpacked. The vacillation was awful; it amounted to\r\nan agony; it involved all the circles; the newspapers were profoundly\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon starts. Editors forget their proofs; Baboos forget Moses;\r\nmothers forget their cicisbeos. The mind of Calcutta is turned upon\r\nthe Gryphon.\r\n\r\nA thousand blue eyes and ten thousand black focus him. He takes his\r\nseat. A double-first class carriage has been reserved. The\r\nSuperintendent-General of Balloons and Fireworks appears on the\r\nplatform: the Gryphon steps out, takes precedence of him, and then\r\nreturns to his carriage. The excitement increases. Pre-paid telegrams\r\nare flashed to Bombay, Madras, Allahabad, and Lahore; the engine\r\nwhistles \"God save the Queen-Empress and the Secretary to the Punjab\r\nGovernment;\" and the train pours out its glories into the darkness.\r\n\r\nMy Lord is deeply stirred. He believes the Asian mystery has been\r\nsolved. He returns to Government House and gives vent to his\r\noverwrought feelings in smoke--Parascho cigarettes; then he telegraphs\r\nhimself to sleep. Dreams sweep over him, issuing from the fabled gates\r\nof shining ivory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Gryphon speeds on, yearning like a god in pain for his\r\nfar-away aphelion in Kabul. Morning bashfully overtakes him; and the\r\ntrain dances into stations festooned with branches of olive and palm.\r\nA _feu-de-joie_ of champagne corks is fired; special correspondents in\r\nclean white trousers enliven the scene; Baron Reuter's ubiquitous\r\nyoung man turns on rapturous telegrams; and a faint smile dawns darkly\r\non the Gryphon's scorn-worn face.\r\n\r\nMerrily shrieks the whistling engine as the Punjab comes sliding down,\r\nthe round world to welcome its curled darling. It spurns with\r\ncontemptuous piston the vulgar corn-growing provinces of Couper; it\r\nseeks the fields that are sown with dragon's teeth; it hisses forward\r\nwith furious joy, like the flaming chariot of some Heaven-booked\r\nProphet. Already Egerton anticipates its welcome advent. He can hardly\r\nsit still on his pro-consular throne; he smiles in dockets and\r\ndemi-officials; he walks up and down his alabaster halls, and out into\r\nhis gardens of asphodel, and snuffs the air. It is redolent with some\r\nrare effluvium; pomatum-laden winds breathe across the daffadown\r\ndillies from the warm chambers of the south. A cloud crosses His\r\nHonour's face, a summer cloud dissolving into sunshine. \"It is the\r\npomade of Saul:--but it is our own glorious David whose unctuous curls\r\ncarry the Elysian fragrance.\" Then taking up his harp and dancing an\r\necstatic measure, he sings--\r\n\r\n      \"He is coming, my Gryphon, my swell;\r\n      Were it ever so laden with care,\r\n      My heart would know him, and smell\r\n      The grease in his coal-black hair.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Punjab is astir. Deputy Commissioners, and Extra\r\nAssistant Commissioners, and Kookas, and Sikhs, and Mazhabi-Sikhs\r\ncrowd the stations; but the Gryphon passes fiercely onwards. The light\r\nof battle is now in his eye; he is in uniform; a political sword hangs\r\nfrom his divine waist; a looking-glass poses itself before him. Life\r\nburns wildly in his heart: time throbs along in hot seconds; Eternity\r\nunfolds around her far-receding horizons of glory.\r\n\r\nThe train emits telegrams as it hurls itself forward: \"the Gryphon is\r\nwell:--he is in the presence of his Future:--History watches him:--he\r\nis drinking a peg:--the _Civil and Military Gazette_ has caught a\r\nglimpse of him:--glory, glory, glory, to the Gryphon, the mock turtle\r\nis his wash-pot, over Lyall will he cast his shoe.\"\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are felt all along the line from Peshawar to Kabul.\r\nStrings of camels laden with portmanteaus stretch from the rising to\r\nthe setting sun. The whole of the Guides and Bengal Cavalry have\r\nresolved themselves into orderlies, and are riding behind the Gryphon.\r\nTens of thousands of insurgents are lining the road and making holiday\r\nto see the Gryphon pass.\r\n\r\nKabul is astir. Roberts, with bare feet and a rope round his neck,\r\ncomes forward, performs _Kadambosi_ and presents the keys of Sherpur\r\nto the Gryphon, who hands them graciously to his Extra Assistant\r\nDeputy Khidmatgar General. The wires are red hot with messages: \"The\r\nGryphon is taking a pill; the Gryphon is bathing; the Gryphon is\r\nbreakfasting; the Gryphon is making a joke; the Gryphon has been\r\nbitten by a flea; the wound is not pronounced dangerous, he is\r\nrecovering slowly:--Glory, glory to the Gryphon--Amen, amen!\"--\r\nYOUR POLITICAL ORPHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORPHAN'S GOOD RESOLUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[June 8, 1880.]\r\n\r\n      Part I.--Persons I will try to avoid.\r\n       \"  II.--Things I will try to avoid.\r\n       \" III.--Habits I will try to avoid.\r\n       \"  IV.--Opinions I will try to avoid.\r\n       \"   V.--Circumstances I will try to avoid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--BAD COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONS I WILL TRY TO AVOID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nHe has a villa in the country; but his place of business is in town;\r\nsomewhere near Sackville Street. Vulgarity had marked him for her own\r\nat an early age. She had set her mark indelibly on his speech, his\r\nmanners, and his habits. When ten years old he had learned to aspirate\r\nhis initial vowels; when twelve he had mastered the whole theory and\r\npractice of eating cheese with his knife; at seventeen his mind was\r\nsaturated with ribald music of the Vaudeville type.\r\n\r\nReader, you anticipate me? You suppose I refer to one of Mr.\r\nGladstone's new Ministers, or to one of Lord Beaconsfield's new\r\nBaronets?\r\n\r\nYou are, of course, mistaken. My man is a tailor; one of the best\r\ntailors in the world. He has made hundreds of coats for me; and he has\r\nsent me hundreds of circulars and bills.\r\n\r\nNow, however, he has lost my address, and there seems a coolness\r\nbetween us. We stand aloof; the scars remaining.\r\n\r\nHis name is Sartor, and I owe him a good deal of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nHe is always up to the Hills when the weather is unpleasant on the\r\nplains. Butterfly-collecting, singing to a guitar passionate songs of\r\nlove and hate, and lying the live-long day on a long chair with a long\r\ntumbler in his hand, and a volume of Longfellow on the floor, are his\r\ncharacteristic pursuits. It is needless to say that he is the\r\nAccountant-General, and the last man in the world to suppose that I\r\nhave given myself ten days' privilege leave to the Hills on urgent\r\nprivate affairs,--_affairs de coeur_, and _affairs de rien_, of sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nHis head is shaved to the bone; his face, of the Semitic type, is most\r\nsinister, truculent, and ferocious; his filthy Afghan rags bristle\r\nwith knives and tulwars. He carries five or six matchlocks under one\r\narm, and a hymn book, or Koran, under the other. He is in holy\r\norders--a Ghazi! A pint, or a pint and a half, of my blood, would earn\r\nfor him Paradise, with sharab, houris, and all the rest of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nHe was once an exceedingly pleasant fellow, full of talk and anecdote.\r\nWe were at school together. He was captain of our eleven and at the\r\nhead of the sixth form. I looked up to him; quoted him; imitated him;\r\nlent him my pocket money. Afterwards a great many other people lent\r\nhim their money too, and played _écarté_ with him; yet at no period of\r\nhis life was he rich, and now he is decidedly poor. Still the old love\r\nof borrowing money and playing _écarté_ burns hectically in his bosom,\r\nand with years a habit of turning up the king has grown upon him. No\r\none likes to tell him that he has acquired this habit of turning up\r\nthe king; he is so poor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nShe was rather nice-looking once, and I amused myself with fancying\r\nthat I loved her. She was to me the summer pilot of an empty heart\r\nunto the shores of nothing. It was then that I acquired that facility\r\nin versification which has since so often helped to bind a book, or\r\nline a box, or served to curl a maiden's locks. She, learned reams of\r\nthose verses by heart, and still repeats them. Her good looks and my\r\nillusions have passed away: but those verses--those thrice accursed\r\nverses, remain. How they make my ears tingle! How they burn my cheeks!\r\nWill time, think you, never impair her infernal memory?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nI lisp a little, it is true; but, thank goodness, no longer in\r\nnumbers. I only lisp a little when any occasion arises to utter\r\nsibilant sounds; on such occasions this little girl, the only child of\r\nher mother, and she a widow, mimics my infirmity. The widow is silly\r\nand laughs nervously, as people with a fine sense of humour laugh in\r\nchurch when a book falls. This laugh of the widow is not easy to bear;\r\nfor she is pretty. Were she not pretty her mocking child would come, I\r\nween, to some untimely end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nMy Lord is, more or less, admired by two or three young ladies I know;\r\nand when he puts his arm round my neck and drags me up and down a\r\ncrowded ball-room I cannot help wishing that they were in the pillory\r\ninstead of me. I really wish to be polite to H.E., but how can I say\r\nthat I think he was justified in finessing his deficit and playing\r\nsurpluses?\r\n\r\nHow can I agree with him when he says that Abdur Rahman will come\r\ngalloping in to Cabul to tender his submission as soon as he receives\r\nMr. Lepel Griffin's photograph neatly wrapped up in a Post Office\r\nOrder for two lakhs of rupees? And then that Star of India he is\r\nalways pressing on me! As I say to him,--what should I do with it?\r\n\r\nI can't go hanging things round my neck like King Coffee Calcalli, or\r\nthe Emperor of Blue China.\r\n\r\nBut soon it will not be difficult for me to avoid my Lord: for\r\n\r\n      \"Sic desideriis icta fidelibus\r\n      Quærit patria Cæsarem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nHe still smiles when we meet; and I don't think any the less of him\r\nbecause he was called \"Bumble\" at school and afterwards made Governor\r\nof Bombay. Men drift unconsciously into these things. But when I\r\nhappen to be near him he has a nervous way of lunging with his stick\r\nthat I can't quite get over. They say he once dreamt that I had poked\r\nfun at him in a newspaper; and the hallucination continues to produce\r\nan angry aberration of his mind, coupled with gnashing of the teeth\r\nand other dangerous symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nHe is a huge gob of flesh, which is perhaps animated dimly by some\r\nspark of humanity smouldering filthily in a heart cancerous with\r\nmoney-grubbing. His whole character and mode of life stink with\r\npoisonous exhalations in my moral nostrils. Nature denounces, in her\r\nloud commination service, his clammy hand, his restless eye, his\r\nsinister and bestial mouth. Why should he waken me from the dreams of\r\nliterature and the low music of my own reflections to disgorge from\r\nthe cesspool of his mind the impertinent questions and the loathsome\r\ncompliments which form his notion of conversation? He has come to \"pay\r\nhis respects.\" I abhor \"his respects.\" He is rich:--What is that to\r\nme? He is powerful with all the power of corruption: I scorn his\r\npower, I figuratively spit upon it. He is perhaps the man whom the\r\nGovernment delights to honour. More shame to the Government! A bully\r\nat home, and a tyrant among his own people, on all sides dastardly and\r\nmean, he is a bad representative of a gentle and intellectual race,\r\nthat for its heroic traditions, its high thoughts, its noble language\r\nand its exquisite urbanity has been the wonder of the whole world\r\nsince the dawn of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nA cocked hat, a tailcoat with gold buttons and a rapier:--\"See'st thou\r\nnot the air of the court in these enfoldings? Hath not his gait in it\r\nthe measure of the court? Receives not thy nose court-odour from him?\r\nReflects he not on thy baseness court-contempt?\" Observe how\r\nmysterious he is: consider the secrets burning on his tongue. He is\r\nall asides and whispers and winks and nods to other young popinjays of\r\nthe same feather. He could tell you the very brand of the pills the\r\nRaja is taking: he receives the paltriest gossip of the Nawab's court\r\nfiltered through a lying vakeel. Ten to one he carries in his pocket a\r\ncipher telegram from Simla empowering him to confer the title of\r\n_Jee_[CC] on some neighbouring Thakor. Surely it is no wonder that he\r\nbelieves himself to be the hub of creation. Within a radius of twenty\r\nmiles there is no one even fit to come between the wind and his\r\nnobility. If he should ever catch hold of you by the arm and take you\r\naside for a moment from the madding crowd of a lawn-tennis party to\r\nwhisper in your ear the arrival of a complimentary _Kharita_ and a\r\npound of sweetmeats from the Foreign Office for the Jam of Bredanbatta\r\nyou should let off smiles and blushes in token of the honour and glory\r\nthus placed at your credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nAll Assistant-Magistrates on their first arrival in this country,\r\nstuffed like Christmas turkeys with abstracts and notes, the pemmican\r\nof school-boy learnings, are more or less a weariness and a bore; but\r\nthe youth who comes out from the admiring circle of sisters and aunts\r\nwith the airs of a man of the world and the blight of a premature\r\n_ennui_ is peculiarly insufferable. Of course he has never\r\nknown at home any grown-up people beyond the chrysalis stage of\r\nundergraduatism, except to receive from them patronising hospitalities\r\nand little attentions in the shape of guineas and stalls at the opera,\r\nsuch as good-natured seniors delight to show to promising young\r\nkinsmen and friends. Yet his talk is of the studio, the editor's room,\r\nand the club; it is flavoured with the _argot_ of the great world, the\r\nhalf world and Bohemia; he flings great names in your face, dropping\r\nwith a sublime familiarity the vulgar prefixes of \"Mr.\" and \"Lord,\"\r\nand he overwhelms you with his knowledge of women and their wicked\r\nways. Clever Ouida, with her tawdry splendours, her guardsmen, her\r\npeers, her painters and her Aspasias, and the \"society papers,\" with\r\ntheir confidences and their personalities, have much to answer for in\r\nthe case of this would-be man of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OCCULT PHENOMENA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[October 21, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThere were thirteen of them, and they sat down to dinner just as the\r\nclock in the steeple chimed midnight. The sheeted dead squeaked and\r\ngibbered in their graves; the owl hooted in the ivy. \"For what we are\r\ngoing to receive may the Secret Powers of Nature and the force of\r\ncircumstances make us truly thankful,\" devoutly exclaimed the domestic\r\nmedium. The spirits of Chaos and Cosmos rapped a courteous\r\nacknowledgment on the table. _Potage à la sorcière_ (after the famous\r\nrecipe in Macbeth) was served in a cauldron; and while it was being\r\nhanded round, Hume recited his celebrated argument regarding miracles.\r\nHe had hardly reached the twenty-fifth hypothesis, when a sharp cry\r\nstartled the company, and Mr. Cyper Redalf, the eminent journalist,\r\nwas observed to lean back in his chair, pale and speechless. His whole\r\nframe was convulsed with emotion; his hair stood erect and emitted\r\nelectro-biological sparks. The company sat aghast. A basin of soup\r\ndashed in his face and a few mesmeric passes soon brought him round,\r\nhowever; and presently he was able to explain to the assembled\r\ncarousers the cause of his agitation. It was a recollection, a tender\r\nmemory of youth. The umbrella of his boyhood had suddenly surged upon\r\nhis imagination! It was an umbrella from which he had been parted for\r\nyears: it was an umbrella round which had once centred associations\r\nsolemn and mysterious. In itself there had been nothing remarkable\r\nabout the umbrella. It was a gingham, conceived in the liberal spirit\r\nof a bygone age; such an umbrella as you would not easily forget when\r\nit had once fairly bloomed on the retina of your eye; yet an everyday\r\numbrella, a commonplace umbrella half a century ago; an umbrella that\r\nwould have elicited no remark from our great-grandmothers, hardly a\r\nsmile from our grandmothers; but an umbrella well calculated to excite\r\nthe affections and stimulate the imagination of an impulsive,\r\nhigh-spirited, and impressionable boy. It was an umbrella not easily\r\nforgotten; an umbrella that necessarily produced a large and deep\r\nimpression on the mind.\r\n\r\nAll present were profoundly moved; a feeling of dismay crept over\r\nthem, defacing their festivity. Tears were shed. Only from one pair of\r\ndamp eyes did any gleam of hope or comfort radiate.\r\n\r\nA distinguished foreigner, well known in the uttermost spirit-circles,\r\nwiped from his brow drops of perspiration which some dream had\r\nloosened from his brain. He felt the tide of psychic force beating\r\nupon the high shores of his heart. He was conscious of a\r\nconstitutional change sweeping like a tempest over his protoplastic\r\ntissue. He felt that the secret fountains of his being were troubled\r\nby the angel of spirit-rapping, and that his gross, unbelieving\r\nnature stepped down, bathed, and was healed. The Moses of the\r\nspirit-wilderness struck the rock of his material life, and occult\r\ndynamics came welling forth from the undiscovered springs of\r\nconsciousness. His mortal statics lost their equilibrium in a general\r\nflux of soul. A cyclone raged round his mesmeric aura. He began to\r\napprehend an epiphany of electro-biological potentiality. The fierce\r\nlight that never was in kerosine or tallow dawned round him; matter\r\nmelted like mist; souls were carousing about him; the great soul of\r\nnature brooded like an aurora of clairvoyance above all; his awful\r\nmediumhood held him fiercely in her mystic domination; and things grew\r\nto a point. From the focus of the clairvoyant aurora clouds of\r\ncreative impulse gathered, and sweeping soulward were condensed in\r\nimmaterial atoms upon the cold peaks of Purpose. Thus a spiritual\r\ngingham impressed upon his soul of souls a matrix, out of which, by a\r\nfine progenitive effort, he now begets and ejects a materialized\r\ngingham into a potato-plot of the garden without.\r\n\r\nThe thing is patent to all who live above the dead-level of vulgar\r\nimbecility. No head of a department could fail to understand it.\r\nIndeed, to such as live on the uplands of speculation, not only is the\r\nprocess lucid in itself, but it is luciferous, illuminating all the\r\nobscure hiding-places of Nature. It is the magic-lantern of creation;\r\nit is the key to all mysticism, to the three-card trick, and to the\r\nbasket-trick; it sheds a glory upon thimble-rigging, a halo upon\r\nlegerdemain; it even radiates vagabond beams of splendour upon\r\npocket-picking and the cognate arts. It explains how the apples get\r\ninto the dumpling; how the milk comes out of the cocoanut; how the\r\ndeficit issues from the surplus; how matter evolves itself from\r\nnothing. It renders the hypothesis of a First Cause not only\r\nunnecessary, but exquisitely ludicrous. Under such dry light as it\r\noffers to our intelligence the whole epos of Christianity seems a\r\nvapid dream.\r\n\r\nBut I anticipate conclusions. We must go back to the dinner-party and\r\nto Mr. Cyper Redalf, who has been restored to consciousness, and who\r\nstill is the object of general sympathy; for it is not until the\r\ndisturbance in the distinguished foreigner's nerve aura has amounted\r\nto a psychic cyclone that the company perceive his interesting\r\ncondition, and begin to look for a manifestation. The hopes of some\r\nfondly turn to raps, others desire the pressure of a spirit hand, or\r\nthe ringing of a bell, or the levitation of furniture, or the sound of\r\na spirit voice, the music of an immaterial larynx. Dinner is soon\r\nforgotten; the thing has become a _séance_, hands are joined, the\r\nlights are instinctively lowered, and the whole company, following an\r\nirresistible impulse, march round and round the room, and then out\r\ninto the darkness after the soul-stirred foreigner, after the\r\nforeigner of distinction. Is it unconscious cerebration that leads\r\nthem to the potato-plot, or is it the irresistible influence of some\r\nSupreme Power, something more occult and more interesting than God,\r\nthat compels them to fall on their knees, and grub with their hands in\r\nthe recently manured potato-bed? I must leave this question\r\nunanswered, as a sufficiently occult explanation does not occur to me:\r\nbut suffice it to say that this search after truth, this burrowing in\r\nthe gross earth for some spiritual sign, appears to me a spectacle at\r\nonce inspiring and touching. It seems to me that human life has seldom\r\nhad anything more beautiful and more ennobling to show than these\r\npostmaster-generals, boards of revenue, able editors, and foreigners\r\nof distinction asking Truth, the Everlasting Verity, for a sign and\r\nthen searching for it in a potato-field. In this glorious quest every\r\ncircumstance demands our respectful attention. They search on their\r\nhands and knees in the attitude of passionate prayer; they search in\r\nthe dark; they seize the dumb earth with delirious fingers; they knock\r\ntheir heads against one another and against the dull, hard trunks of\r\ntrees. Still they search: they wrestle with the Earth: she must yield\r\nup her secrets. Nor will Earth deny to them the desired boon. Theirs\r\nis the true spirit of devout inquiry, and they are persons of\r\nconsideration in evening-dress. Nature will unveil her charms. Earth\r\nwith the groans of an infinite pain, a boundless travail, yields up\r\nthe gingham umbrella.\r\n\r\nWe will not intrude upon their immediate rapture as they carry their\r\ntreasure away with loving hands; but it is necessary to note the means\r\ntaken to prove, for the satisfaction only of a foolish and unbelieving\r\nworld, the supernatural nature of the phenomenon. The umbrella is\r\nexamined under severe test conditions: it is weighed in a vacuum, and\r\nplaced under the spectroscope. It is found to be porous and a\r\nconductor of heat; but it is not soluble in water, though it boils at\r\n500° Fahr. To demonstrate the absence of trickery or collusion\r\neveryone turns up his sleeves and empties his waistcoat pockets. There\r\nis no room for sleight of hand in presence of this searching\r\nscientific investigation. The umbrella _is_ certainly _not_ a\r\nsupposititious animal; yet it is the umbrella of Mr. Cyper Redalf's\r\nboyhood. No one can doubt this who sees him clasp it in a fond\r\nembrace, who sees him shed burning tears on its voluminous folds.--THE\r\nORPHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELUCIDATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE VICEROY\r\n\r\nThe late Edward Robert Bulwer, First Earl of Lytton (1831-1891),\r\nViceroy and Governor-General of India from April 12, 1876, to June 8,\r\n1880, is here depicted from the superficial point of view of his\r\ncharacter as a man, a poet, and a statesman generally current at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton was thoroughly unconventional in all his manners and\r\nmoods, and in his methods of conducting the affairs of his great\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAs a boy of seven he was already scribbling verses; and he wrote a\r\npoem, \"The Prisoner of Provence,\" which turns upon the famous story of\r\nthe Man in the Iron Mask, only two or three months before his death.\r\nIn fact, all through Lord Lytton's distinguished career, as his father\r\nhad done before him, he found recreation in change of employment. As\r\nforcibly and eloquently stated by his daughter, Lady Betty Balfour, in\r\nher introduction to the 1894 edition of his Selected Poems, \"The minds\r\nof both were ceaselessly active, and they turned without a pause from\r\none kind of thought and business to another as readily as they turned\r\nfrom either to easy, disengaged conversation. Had the rival calls of\r\nhis many-sided intellect been at variance, the poet in my father would\r\nalways have had the preference.\"\r\n\r\nAli Baba, it may be taken for granted, did not intend to characterise\r\nas \"a flood of twaddle\" the whole of Lord Lytton's verse. Poetry\r\nwhich, as far as published up to 1855, called forth from Leigh Hunt\r\nwarm praise for its beauties and mercy for its defects, in these words\r\nembodied in a letter to Mr. John Forster, the friend and biographer of\r\nCharles Dickens.--\r\n\r\n      \"I have read every bit of Owen Meredith's [his now\r\n      well-known pseudonym] volume, and it has left me in a state\r\n      of delighted admiration. He is a truly musical, reflecting,\r\n      impassioned and imaginative poet, with a tendency to but one\r\n      of the faults of his contemporaries and that chiefly in his\r\n      minor pieces--I mean the doing too much, and the giving too\r\n      much importance and emphasis to every fancy and image that\r\n      comes across him, so that his pictures lose their proper\r\n      distribution of light and shade, nay, of distinction between\r\n      great and small. On his greatest occasions, however, he can\r\n      evidently rid himself of this fault.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Lord Lytton's Indian career, those who were on political or\r\nself-interested grounds opposed to his policy--and there were many\r\nsuch--were wont, as recorded by his daughter, to attempt to discredit\r\nthe statesman by reiterating that he was a poet.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Aberigh Mackay's acquaintance with Lord Lytton's\r\npoetry was mainly, if not entirely, based upon a volume edited by N.A.\r\nChick, and published in Calcutta in 1877, quaintly entitled: \"The\r\nImperial Bouquet of Pretty Flowers from the Poetical Parterre of\r\nRobert Lord Lytton, Viceroy and Governor-General of India.\"\r\n\r\nOur Author's knowledge of Lord Lytton's Indian Administration was\r\nnecessarily based upon the views--_pro_ and _con_--expressed by the\r\ndaily newspaper writers of the period, who wrote, of course,\r\nuninitiated in political affairs as a rule, and without those full\r\nexpositions now embodied in many notable recent publications, official\r\nand other, foremost among which we would cite Lady Betty Balfour's\r\nHistory of his Indian Administration, published in 1899, and her\r\nedition of her father's personal and literary letters, issued in two\r\nvols. in 1906.\r\n\r\nVerily \"Time tries All,\" and an impartial and notable summary of Lord\r\nLytton's services to his country, written by the Reverend W. Elvin, is\r\nengraven on the monument to his memory in the crypt of St. Paul's\r\nCathedral, which was designed and partially carried out by the\r\nsculptor, Mr. Gilbert.\r\n\r\n+HE WAS A DIPLOMATIST RICK IN THE QUALITIES, OFFICIAL, AND SOCIAL, BY\r\nWHICH AMITY WITH FOREIGN NATIONS IS MAINTAINED.+\r\n\r\n+A VICEROY INDEPENDENT IN HIS VIEWS, RESOLUTE IN ACTION, LOOKING\r\nFORWARD TO THE FUTURE.+\r\n\r\n+A POET OF MANY STYLES, EACH THE EXPRESSION OF HIS HABITUAL THOUGHTS.+\r\n\r\n+A MAN OF SUPERIOR FACULTIES HIGHLY CULTIVATED BE LITERATURE, ARDENT\r\nIN HIS AFFECTIONS, TENDER AND GENEROUS IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF\r\nLIFE, LAVISH IN HIS COMMENDATION OF OTHERS, AND HUMBLE IN HIS ESTIMATE\r\nOF HIMSELF.+\r\n\r\nAs a good example of Lord Lytton's independent views, and tenderness\r\nand generosity in all the circumstances of life, the following\r\nincident may be quoted:--\r\n\r\nAmong many changes in Indian administration which he initiated, and\r\nwhich were severely decried at the time, but the benefits of which\r\nexperience has amply vindicated, was the amalgamation of Oudh with, or\r\nrather annexation to, the North-Western Provinces, the final\r\narrangements being completed at the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi on\r\nJanuary 1 1877, with the concurrence--which he had sought\r\npreviously--of all the principal Talukdars of Oudh there assembled.\r\n\r\nThe great pageant at Delhi (which formed the subject of Ali Baba's\r\nfirst contribution to _Vanity Fair_, and which he attended officially\r\nas the Guardian of the Raja of Rutlam), so far from being a mere empty\r\nshow, as then decried by his political foes, enabled the Viceroy to\r\nsettle, promptly and satisfactorily by personal conferences, a great\r\nmany important administrative questions. All as recorded by him in his\r\nnarrative letter of December 23, 1876, to January 10, 1877, to her\r\nlate Majesty Queen Victoria, which embraced events at Delhi, Pattiala,\r\nUmballa, Aligurh, and Agra.\r\n\r\nAmong the Oudh officials who were dispossessed of their appointments\r\nin 1877, some of them with but scanty compensation, was the late Mr.\r\n(afterwards Sir) E.N.C. Braddon, a kinsman of the novelist, who held\r\nthe appointment of Superintendent of Stamps, Stationery, and\r\nRegistration at Lucknow. Mr. Braddon was an uncovenanted servant of\r\ncomparatively short service, and eligible for s very moderate\r\ncompensation. Lord Lytton, unsolicited, took up his case, overruled\r\nvarious objections, obtained liberal terms for Mr. Braddon by which he\r\nwas able to resign his appointment and proceed to Tasmania, where he\r\nentered political life, rising to be Premier and afterwards\r\nAgent-General for that Colony in London, and ultimately obtaining, in\r\n1891, his K.C.M.G.\r\n\r\nIt was to Lord Lytton's personal action--in the face of would-be\r\nobsequious apathy in certain quarters--that Aberigh-Mackay, the\r\nyoungest on the list, was nominated a Fellow of the Calcutta\r\nUniversity in 1880, an honour usually reserved for officials of high\r\nstanding. He then availed himself of that status to bring about the\r\naffiliation of the Rajkumar College at Indore to the same University,\r\nwith, as a matter of course, the concurrence of the Syndicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE A.-D.-C.-IN-WAITING\r\n\r\nWe have here an admirable summary of the highly important personal\r\nduties of a tactful A.D.C. to an Indian Viceroy. Not the least\r\nimportant being the superintendence of the Invitation Department. It\r\nwas in this very connection that an A.D.C. to an Indian Governor,\r\nfresh from a West Indian appointment and Society somewhat on \"Tom\r\nCringle's Log\" conditions, by issuing invitations to a _Quality\r\nDance_, gave rise, in Southern India, to a social commotion which\r\nreacted very unfavourably as regards the efficient working of various\r\ndepartments of his Chief's general administration.\r\n\r\nIn pre-Mutiny days in India an officer who could not carve meat and\r\nfowl well had a very poor chance of such an appointment. Happily the\r\ninstitution of _à la Russe_ fashions in the service of the table has\r\nor many years past rendered such qualifications unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo the regret of a very wide circle, the \"loud, joyful and\r\nsteeplechasing Lord \"--the late Lord William Beresford--alluded to by\r\nAli Baba, died in England in 1900. From 1875 to 1881 he was A.D.C. to\r\nViceroys of India, and it was in the \"distant wars\" of the Jowaki\r\nexpedition, 1877-8, in the Zulu War, 1879, where he gained the\r\nVictoria Cross, and in the Afghan War, 1880, that his military career\r\nwas spent.\r\n\r\nFrom 1881 to 1894 Lord William Beresford very ably served Viceroys of\r\nIndia as their Military Secretary. Services which were admirably\r\nsummed up by a speaker on Dec. 30, 1893, when he was entertained at a\r\nfarewell dinner at the Town Hall, Calcutta, by 180 friends, who\r\ndeclared that \"he had raised the office to a science, and himself from\r\nan official into an institution, and acquired a reputation absolutely\r\nunique.\"\r\n\r\nThe voluminous and noteworthy annals of Indian sport can show no\r\nkeener sportsman and successful rider of steeplechases and polo\r\nplayer. He won the Viceroy's Cup six times and many other principal\r\nevents at race-meetings in India.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Lord William retired from India, and in England maintained a\r\nrenowned racing stable, being in addition one of the first to own\r\nAmerican horses and employ American jockeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important change affecting the power and functions of\r\nthe Indian Commander-in-chief, together with various other reforms in\r\nthe military administration of India, were all anticipated,\r\nforeshadowed, and--it is believed--largely helped on by this very\r\npaper, and others under the general heading of _Things in India_,\r\ncontributed by Ali Baba to _Vanity Fair_ during 1879.\r\n\r\nAli Baba, unlike some others that might readily be cited, would\r\ndoubtless have been foremost in according most generous\r\nacknowledgments to the services in the cause of Indian Army reform,\r\nrendered in past days by many great Commanders-in-Chief in India.\r\n\r\nChief among such men might be cited Sir Charles James Napier\r\n(1782-1853), the conqueror of Scinde, who in 1849 returned to India,\r\nnominated by the Duke of Wellington to deal with the crisis caused by\r\nthe Sikh campaign. Arriving in Calcutta on the 6th May, he at once\r\nassumed the command, the term of service of Lord Gough, who had\r\nbrought the campaign to a successful end, being concluded. Napier's\r\ntoo short administration of little over eighteen months was rather\r\njudicial than military, but he effected many reforms on the parade\r\nground and in cantonments.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the day eagerly chronicled the records of the\r\nproceedings in which he vigorously combated the vices of intoxication,\r\ngambling, insubordination, and other crimes and misdemeanours, both in\r\nofficers and men of the Queen's and Company's forces alike.\r\n\r\nIt was during his command that separate barrack-room accommodation was\r\nprovided for married soldiers. The state of affairs hitherto\r\nprevailing may well be imagined by an inspection of the barrack life\r\npictures and caricatures of artists such as Ramberg, Gillray,\r\nRowlandson, and others.\r\n\r\nHe also founded Soldiers' Institutes, and encouraged soldiers in the\r\nQueen's army to rear such pets as monkeys and parrots by regulations\r\nfor their transport on route and transfer marches, which afforded\r\nmaterial for many humorous sketches and paragraphs in the pages of\r\n_The Delhi Punch_. Wise and considerate regulations which are\r\ncontinued in the existing concessions as to the carriage of \"soldiers'\r\npets\" by troop trains and homeward-bound Indian transports.\r\n\r\nColonel R.H. Vetch (_Dictionary of National Biography_) admirably sums\r\nup Napier's character by recording of him that \"his disregard of\r\nluxury, simplicity of manner, careful attention to the wants of the\r\nsoldiers under his command, and enthusiasm for duty and right won him\r\nthe admiration of his men. His journals testify to his religious\r\nconvictions, while his life was one long protest against oppression,\r\ninjustice and wrongdoing. Generous to a fault, a radical in politics,\r\nyet an autocrat in government, hot-tempered and impetuous, he was a\r\nman to inspire strong affection or the reverse, and his enemies were\r\nas numerous as his friends.\"\r\n\r\nAltogether a very different character from that which all and sundry\r\nare warned to avoid by the--to a great extent--satirical word-picture\r\nrecorded by Ali Baba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE ARCHDEACON\r\n\r\nIn this article Ali Baba has pourtrayed with infinite skill and\r\ngeniality the many-sided character of the late Joseph Baly, M.A., who\r\nwas Archdeacon of Calcutta from 1872 until he retired from India in\r\n1883. Appointed to the Bengal Ecclesiastical establishment in 1861,\r\nMr. Baly served as Chaplain at Sealkote, Simla, and Allahabad until\r\n1870, when, while on furlough in England, he acted as Rector of\r\nFalmouth until 1872. In 1885 he was appointed chaplain at the church\r\nin Windsor Park, built by Queen Victoria, in which appointment he died\r\nin 1909, aged eighty-five.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of his Indian career the Reverend gentleman\r\ninterested himself in that burning question of the employment of the\r\nAnglo-Indian and Eurasian community of India; a large indigenous and\r\npermanent element in the population, the disposal of which is still a\r\nquestion of very great public importance, and its practical solution a\r\npressing necessity. The Archdeacon had this question, paraphrased by\r\nAli Baba as that of the \"Mean Whites,\" greatly at heart, and the\r\nconclusions he arrived at and suggestions made by him from time to\r\ntime, ably and vigorously summarized in a paper he read before the\r\nBengal Social Science Association on May 1st, 1879, in Calcutta, were\r\nproductive of considerable good.\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Baly's predecessor was the Venerable John Henry Pratt, an\r\nattached friend of Aberigh-Mackay's father, to whom his book, _From\r\nLondon to Lucknow_, published in 1860, was \"affectionately inscribed.\"\r\nCertain traits in the character of this Archdeacon known to Ali Baba\r\nby tradition are pourtrayed in the concluding portion of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThis article is of a composite nature. At the time it was published in\r\n1879, the foreign policy of Lord Lawrence was a burning question, and\r\nin connection with the Afghan War then running its course, renewed\r\nattention was directed to the two essays, \"Masterly Inactivity\" and\r\n\"Mischievous Activity,\" first published in _The Fortnightly Review_ in\r\nDecember 1869, and March 1870, respectively, by a comparatively young\r\nBengal Civilian, the late J.W.S. Wyllie, C.S.I. (1835-1870). Beyond\r\nthe fact that these essays and certain other papers by the same\r\nbrilliant author on the subject of the policy of the Indian Government\r\nwith independent principalities and powers beyond the bounds of India\r\nwere probably in Ali Baba's mind, the character of the supercilious\r\nSecretary was very remote from that of Mr. Wyllie.\r\n\r\nThe typical person held up to derision by Ali Baba has been oft times\r\ndecried as one very detrimental to good government in India, where a\r\npersonal and absolute rule must needs obtain for some time to come. By\r\nnone more pointedly than by the present Secretary of State for India\r\nwhen addressing his constituents at Arbroath on October 21, 1907, when\r\nhe informed them that \"India is perhaps the one country--bad manners,\r\noverbearing manners are very disagreeable in all countries--India is\r\nthe only country where bad and overbearing manners are a political\r\ncrime.\" Or, as a prominent Mohammedan in India very well said, \"When\r\nthe English govern from the heart they do it admirably; when they try\r\nto be clever, they make a mess of it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the restored passage on p. 35 there is delineated a Secretary in\r\nstriking contrast to the other. The Secretary in the Foreign\r\nDepartment referred to was the late Mr. le Poer Wynne, under whom\r\nAberigh-Mackay had worked at Simla in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.E. THE BENGALI BABOO\r\n\r\nAli Baba avowedly treats the Bengali Baboo merely as a being \"full of\r\ninappropriate words and phrases ... and the loose shadows of English\r\nthought.\" Such being the case, it must never be forgotten that he is\r\nthe product, in every sense of the word, of British modes of purely\r\nsecular education. Modes which, eminently at the present time, are\r\nbeing gravely called in question.\r\n\r\nAll of which has been more lately elaborated by \"F. Anstey,\" _i.e._\r\nMr. Thomas Anstey Guthrie, in the persons of \"Baboo Jabberjee, B.A.\"\r\nand \"A Bayard from Bengal.\"\r\n\r\nThe broad results of purely secular and mainly literary education\r\nmight in fact be quite fairly summed up in the reproachful words of\r\nCaliban--\r\n\r\n      \"You taught me language; and my profit on't\r\n      Is, I know how to curse.\"\r\n\r\nAberigh-Mackay devoted his life in India to counteract the effects of\r\npurely literary instruction, which he persistently deprecated; and the\r\nlast thirty years have undoubtedly witnessed many advances in the same\r\ndirection, tending to the material progress of India.\r\n\r\nAli Baba trembled for the future of Baboodom, that its tendencies as\r\nhe depicted them might infect others who might pass, through various\r\nstages, into \"trampling, hope-bestirred crowds, and so on, out of the\r\nprovince of Ali Baba and into the columns of serious reflection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE RAJA\r\n\r\nIn this article we have a vivid picture--mainly--of a type of Indian\r\nNoble it was Aberigh-Mackay's aim and life's work in India to avoid\r\ncreating. That too from the beginning of his career, but more\r\nespecially in the training, and that not merely in book-learning, he\r\ninitiated and earned on up to the last days of his life within and\r\nwithout the Residency College at Indore. To paraphrase the language of\r\nthe then recently appointed Agent to the Governor-General for Central\r\nIndia--Sir Lepel Griffin--in his first Administrative Report, that for\r\n1880-1881, the happy effects of the training some of the leading\r\nChiefs of Malwa received under Aberigh-Mackay were visible in the\r\nimproved administration of their States. The most notable instance,\r\nthe Governor-General's Agent points out, being observable in Rutlam.\r\nHis Highness the \"Rajah Saheb having conducted the Government with\r\nsuch ability and success as would do credit to the ablest\r\nadministrators.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well worthy of special notice that the Rajah of Rutlam had been,\r\nfrom a period several years antecedent to Aberigh-Mackay's coming to\r\nIndore, his special ward.\r\n\r\nMost effectually did Aberigh-Mackay, one of the best all-round\r\nsportsmen that Modern India ever saw, counteract the \"prodigiously fat\r\nwhite horse with pink points\" tendencies of any of his _alumni_. The\r\ndescription of the kingly cavalcade in this article, _vide_ p. 52,\r\ncalling forth from John Lockwood Kipling _(Beast and Man in India_, p.\r\n196), a most competent and discriminating authority, the following\r\neulogy:--\r\n\r\n      \"The late Mr. Aberigh-Mackay (Ali Baba of _Vanity Fair_),\r\n      one of the brightest and most original, as well as one of\r\n      the most generous spirits who ever handled Indian subjects,\r\n      has drawn a picture in his _Twenty-one Days in India_ of a\r\n      Raja and his Sow[=a]ri [Cavalcade] which could not be\r\n      bettered by a hair's breadth.\"\r\n\r\nAberigh-Mackay in his earliest writings--_e.g._ when, in describing\r\n_The Great Native Princes_ in his \"Handbook of Hindustan,\" published\r\nin 1875, he enters the \"Remark\" against the Nawab of Bahawalpur, \"A\r\nsmart boy of fourteen; a good polo-player\"--laid great stress on the\r\ndesirability of training all Indian noblemen's sons in horsemanship of\r\nall kinds. That his efforts in this direction were crowned with an\r\nabiding and ever-increasing success is well borne out by the testimony\r\ncontained in an article, by Lieutenant E.R. Penrose, 23rd Bengal N.L.\r\nInfantry, accompanying his pictures of \"Incidents in the Career of a\r\nPolo-Pony,\" which appeared in _The Graphic,_ April 10, 1886.\r\nLieutenant Penrose then wrote:--\r\n\r\n      \"Polo is such an institution now in this country, that even\r\n      in the remotest station a couple of enthusiasts may be found\r\n      who will work heaven and earth to get a game of some sort. I\r\n      have lately been stationed at Indore, where there is a\r\n      collegiate school for the sons of native Princes and\r\n      gentlemen. The head of the college was Mr. Aberigh-Mackay,\r\n      the author of that popular book 'Twenty-one Days in India.'\r\n      He was a keen polo-player, and quite imbued his pupils with\r\n      his ardour, so that, though he is now dead, his memory is\r\n      green throughout the whole of Central India. The impetus he\r\n      gave the game has lasted, and consequently, with a few of\r\n      the senior boys in the school, and some of the men of the\r\n      troop of Central Indian Horse (who begin to play almost as\r\n      soon as they can sit a horse), we could always get up a\r\n      game. Some of the boys are not great riders, but like most\r\n      natives they have wonderfully good 'eyes,' and rarely miss\r\n      the ball. Polo-ponies come in very usefully in other\r\n      ways--such as pig-sticking, for their training makes them so\r\n      handy that it is easier to tackle a boar on a polo-pony than\r\n      when mounted on a horse. Besides, they are cheap, and the\r\n      men can afford a pony where they could not stand the expense\r\n      of a horse.\"\r\n\r\nAnother very notable point in this article is the expression of\r\nconfidence in the loyalty, as a general rule, of the Nobles of India.\r\nThis same belief--nay more, _conviction_--is expressed all through the\r\nwritings of Ali Baba.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, voice is given to the thought that \"they have built\r\ntheir houses of cards on the thin crust of British Rule that now\r\ncovers the crater, and they are ever ready to pour a pannikin of water\r\ninto a crack to quench the explosive forces rumbling below,\" _vide_ p.\r\n48.\r\n\r\nReuter, in a telegram from Calcutta dated Friday, February 11, 1910,\r\nand printed in but _few_ of the London newspapers of the 14th, informs\r\nus that:--\r\n\r\n      \"The leading Nobles and Gentry of Bengal have formed an\r\n      Imperial League for the promotion of good feeling between\r\n      Indians and the Government, the denunciation of anarchy and\r\n      sedition, and the education of the people by means of\r\n      lectures and pamphlets in the views of the Government.\r\n\r\n      \"The Maharajah of Burdwan is president, and Maharajah Sir\r\n      Pradyat Tagore secretary of the new league.\"\r\n\r\nIt must of course be borne in mind that since this article was written\r\nby Ali Baba, the formation of the Imperial Service troops, and the\r\nImperial Cadet corps, furnished and in some cases officered by Indian\r\nNobles and their sons, many of whom were educated at Delhi and Indore\r\nby Aberigh-Mackay, surely warrants us in believing that more than a\r\nmere \"pannikin of water\" is _now_ available, if need be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE POLITICAL AGENT\r\n\r\nThe position of Political Agent, important though it was in 1879, is\r\nmuch more so now. The territories of the Indian Princes are being\r\ndaily opened up more and more by railways; many of them contain coal,\r\niron, gold, and other minerals in payable quantities, and the\r\ndevelopment of these resources call for very delicate handling in the\r\nmatter of friendly advice by Political Agents.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, nay, at the present time, loud complaints have been\r\npublished, emanating from experienced and unbiassed sources, that the\r\nposition of many of the great feudatories of India, who by their\r\ntreaty rights are much more allies than subjects of His Majesty the\r\nKing-Emperor, has been reduced to that of a mere figure-head, with no\r\nreal authority except when they meekly obey the dictation of the\r\nBritish Resident.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that many of the Political Agents in 1879 were officers\r\nwho had served in Madras Cavalry Regiments, the Central India Horse\r\nand other corps, but it is also a fact that many of the most\r\nsuccessful administrators India has ever seen have been\r\nSoldier-Politicals.\r\n\r\nColonel Henderson, so pleasantly cited by Aberigh-Mackay, and happily\r\nstill alive, was himself a Madras Cavalry Officer, who served as\r\nUnder-Secretary to the Foreign Department of the Government of India,\r\nas Resident in Kashmir and latterly in Mysore, and Superintendent of\r\noperations for the suppression of Thagi and Dakaiti.\r\n\r\nOur late King's visit to India as Prince of Wales in 1875-6 owed a\r\ngood deal of its success to Colonel Henderson, who was special officer\r\nin attendance, and his services in connection therewith were\r\nrecognized by a Companionship of the order of the Star of India. It\r\nmay also be mentioned here that Aberigh-Mackay became his\r\nBrother-in-law in October, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE COLLECTOR\r\n\r\nIn this sketch, warm with local colour, the real pivot of the great\r\nofficial wheel of Indian administration, \"the Collector,\" is drawn\r\nwith the exactness due to his importance. Withal very lifelike and\r\npicturesque in many of its touches.\r\n\r\nThirty years have of course made great changes in many of the details\r\nof life in the districts of an Indian Province, now as a rule\r\nconnected up by lines of railway. Improved leave rules and many other\r\ncauses have rendered intercourse with the home country much easier.\r\nWhether or no this far easier intercourse is altogether an advantage\r\nto the rulers and the ruled is what is termed a \"burning question\" at\r\nthe present moment. In a word, that improved communications have not\r\ncorrespondingly increased our sympathy with a new birth in intellect,\r\nsocial life, and the affairs of state, all of which are mainly the\r\nresults of British rule.\r\n\r\nThe functions of a Collector, sketched by Ali Baba in an entertaining\r\nmedley, have increased enormously of late years, and the position is\r\nnow said to be less desirable than of old, when it was amusingly said\r\nof every member of civilian society, that the verb \"to collect\" was\r\nconjugated thus: \"I am a collector, you are a collector, he should be\r\na collector, they will be collectors,\" and so on, _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOS. 10, 20 AND 35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABY IN PARTIBUS\r\n\r\nThis sketch, which may well be termed a beautiful lament over poor\r\nBaby, has brought back vividly to many a one touching recollections: a\r\npicture in fact which appealed, and continues to appeal, to an\r\naudience infinitely wider than that of Anglo-India. The same may be\r\nsaid of the sketches \"The Grass-Widow,\" p. 139; \"Mem-Sahib,\" p. 157,\r\nby many considered the best sketch of all; and \"Sahib,\" p. 181. All of\r\nthem full of that pathos and tenderness akin to, but yet differing\r\nwidely from, the bantering style of the others, which are also full of\r\nallusions and covert references to individuals and affairs of the\r\nAnglo-India of thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn \"Sahib,\" however, there are traits of character and other touches\r\ntaken from the life of one who was--among many other features--a\r\n\"merry Collector,\" not yet forgotten by a rapidly decreasing circle of\r\ncontemporaries. While time and ameliorated conditions have changed the\r\n\"loathsome Indian cemetery\" into something of a garden in which Ali\r\nBaba our friend in common would have rejoiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED CHUPRASSIE\r\n\r\nAlas! the Red Chuprassie is still a rift in the lute of Indian\r\nadministration; a reform in Chuprassies would doubtless be more\r\nbeneficial to India than any wonder-working _nostrum_--such as\r\nAdvisory Councils or extended Legislative Councils.\r\n\r\nThe cry for reform in Chuprassies, or in other words the underlings of\r\nmany Departments, is a very old one. Ali Baba's denunciation of the\r\n\"Red Chuprassie\" powerfully expands that one by Sir Alfred Lyall,\r\nwhere in his poem of _The Old Pindaree_, written in 1866, the \"belted\r\nknave\" is associated with the \"hungry retainers\" and others forming\r\nthe camp establishment of an official on tour.\r\n\r\nAli Baba's practice of adequate payment, which he states--in a spirit\r\nof banter--to be potent to remove temptation to bribery and\r\ncorruption, has received attention in connection with recent\r\nameliorations of the terms of subordinate service in India, and it is\r\nbelieved has met with a certain amount of success.\r\n\r\nThe well-meant but not altogether satisfactory trial of the Gaikwar of\r\nBaroda, by a mixed tribunal of Indian Nobles and highly placed British\r\nofficials, which took place during Lord Northbrook's viceroyalty, is\r\nalluded to in the conclusion of the article; in which the Anglo-Indian\r\nsoubriquet for a subservient person--Joe Hookham, literally _jaisa\r\nhukam_ = as may be ordered--is also introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTER\r\n\r\nIt is now upwards of thirty years since this genial picture of a\r\nveritable \"Farmer Prince\" was painted--in bold and broad outline, of\r\ncourse. The years that have passed bringing in their train many\r\naltered conditions, the most important of all, perhaps, being the\r\nreplacing of a natural vegetable dye such as indigo by chemically\r\nproduced substitutes.\r\n\r\nProbably in a few more years the still remaining features of the\r\nBengal indigo planter's off duty life as depicted by Ali Baba will\r\nhave quite disappeared, unless the substitution of sugar planting for\r\nthat of indigo now receiving considerable attention in various Bengal,\r\nand more particularly Tirhoot, districts prove a success.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the Macdonalds, the Beggs, and the Thomases, names now, as\r\nformerly, prominently identified with the great indigo industry, have\r\nbeen assured of continual remembrance. So prominent, in fact, has the\r\nScotch element among planting families always been that it is said\r\nthat if any one present at a race, polo, or Christmas week gathering\r\nwere to shout out \"Mac!\" from the verandah of the Tirhoot Club, every\r\nface in the crowd would be simultaneously turned towards the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe bantering allusion to \"Mr. Caird and _The Nineteenth Century_,\"\r\napplies to that great authority on many and very varied agricultural\r\nsubjects, the late Sir James Caird, who died in 1892. In 1878-79 he\r\nwas deputed to India by the Secretary of State as a member of the\r\nIndian Famine Commission called into being by the Strachey Brothers;\r\nthe general impressions then formed by a six months' tour through\r\nIndia being embodied in the series of articles, entitled \"Notes by the\r\nWay in India; the Land and the People,\" which appeared from July to\r\nOctober, 1879, in _The Nineteenth Century_ magazine, thereafter in\r\nbook form in 1883, and in an augmented form as a third edition in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed account of a Bengal indigo planter's life, mainly\r\nconfined, however, to the processes and surroundings of planting and\r\nmanufacture, there is no more valuable record than the late\r\nColesworthy Grant's well illustrated book, \"Rural Life in Bengal,\"\r\nwhich was published in 1860. In that work may be found a drawing of\r\n\"Mulnath House,\" a glorified illustration of the fast disappearing\r\nsurroundings of a Lower Bengal planter's residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EURASIAN\r\n\r\nIn November, 1879, when this \"Study in chiaro-oscuro\" was published,\r\nrenewed attention was being directed to the Eurasian community in\r\nIndia, mainly by the discussions in all circles aroused by the\r\npublication of the late Archdeacon Baly's Bengal Social Science\r\nAssociation Paper of May in the same year, which dealt with the\r\nemployment, _inter alia_, of Europeans of mixed parentage in India; a\r\nquestion which still engages the anxious consideration of many Indian\r\nstatesmen. Ali Baba's \"Study\" is not an ill-natured summary of the\r\nwidespread discussions of 1879, but indeed as far back as 1843, the\r\nlate John Mawson in his paper, \"The Eurasian Belle,\" which first\r\nappeared in the Calcutta newspaper, _The Bengal Hurkaru_, had\r\napproached the social and domestic side of the question, and to some\r\nextent may be said to have anticipated Ali Baba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOS. 14 AND 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGER AND THE SHIKARRY\r\n\r\nBoth of these sketches are examples of what maybe termed Ali Baba's\r\ncontemplative mood, the villager's life being revealed to us in all\r\nits pathos and interest, otherwise than through an atmosphere of\r\nstatistics and reports--the daily life of probably two hundred million\r\nof the inhabitants of India.\r\n\r\nAberigh-Mackay early showed in his book \"A Manual of Indian Sport,\"\r\nwhich, in addition to collecting in small compass lessons taught by\r\nmany a noted Indian hunter, contains a great deal of original matter\r\nuseful to every would-be sportsman, that he was well fitted to depict\r\n\"The Shikarry\" in correct and graphic manner and from actual personal\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOS. 15 AND 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD COLONEL AND THE CIVIL SURGEON\r\n\r\n\"The Old Colonel\" and \"The Civil Surgeon,\" p. 123, are both types of\r\ncharacters that have since practically ceased to exist in India,\r\nalthough fairly numerous in the 1870's.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Colonel,\" a relic of the great changes caused by the\r\ndisappearance of many regiments during the Indian Mutiny, and the\r\nalterations in Army organisation due to the introduction of the \"Staff\r\ncorps\" system, has disappeared from the scene, having long since\r\nattained the pensioned rank for which he was ripening when depicted by\r\nAli Baba.\r\n\r\nAs regards \"The Civil Surgeon,\" an entirely new state of conditions\r\nhas altered him also. Even, however, in Ali Baba's time it could not\r\nbe said--as it was \"long ago\"--that a medical officer intended for an\r\nIndian career, in order to become perfectly qualified need only sleep\r\none night on a medicine chest.\r\n\r\nAll the same, to those of us who can look back to life in India forty\r\nor fifty years ago, there will surely arise visions of many genial old\r\ncolonels and doctors, full of good stories and much sympathy in health\r\nor sickness for those just entering upon an Indian career.\r\n\r\nCaptain Atkinson, in his book \"Curry and Rice,\" published at the lime\r\nof the Indian Mutiny, depicted by pen and pencil individuals who in\r\nafter years developed into Ali Baba's subjects. Illustrations which\r\nmay now surely be regarded as valuable records of past Anglo-Indian\r\nlife and character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOS. 19 AND 21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLING M.P. AND ALI BABA ALONE\r\n\r\n\"The Travelling M.P.\" requires no elucidation. He is still with us and\r\nhas developed greatly during the course of years, in fact, increased\r\nfacilities of communication between England and India have much\r\nincreased the species. Happily there are correctives in the shape of\r\nadverse votes by constituents which, in some notorious instances at\r\nthe last Parliamentary elections, have relieved the situation.\r\n\r\nAs to \"Ali Baba Alone,\" nothing could add to the perfect picture\r\nwhich, among other things, good-naturedly alludes to many surmises and\r\nrumours current at the time as to the identity of the Author, leading\r\nin some cases to public disclaimers by various highly placed officials\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEAPOT SERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SOCIAL DISSECTION\" and \"THE ORPHAN'S GOOD RESOLUTIONS\"\r\n\r\nThese papers when first published in _The Bombay Gazette_ aroused keen\r\nspeculation as to their authorship. They are as applicable to Society\r\neverywhere as to that of Anglo-India. Greatly appreciated all over\r\nIndia, they were, with the others of the series, reprinted in book\r\nform and published shortly before the Author's death in a volume,\r\nentitled \"Serious Reflections by a Political Orphan,\" which has long\r\nbeen out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE GRYPHON'S ANABASIS\"\r\n\r\nThe amiable and other idiosyncracies---personal and official--of the\r\nlate Sir Lepel Griffin, K.C.S.I., who, born in 1840, died on March 9,\r\n1908, having retired in 1889 from the Bengal Civil Service, which he\r\nentered'in 1860 by open competition, and of which he was a\r\ndistinguished ornament, are very well pourtrayed in this article. An\r\narticle of very tragic interest, because its publication was the\r\nindirect cause, in all human probability, of the death of its Author.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to recount Sir Lepel Griffin's career in many\r\nhigh places of Indian administration and diplomacy, latterly more\r\nparticularly in the Punjab and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nSuffice it here to say that in 1880, when Chief Secretary of the\r\nPunjab, a post he had then held for upwards of nine years--earning the\r\nreputation of being the _best_ occupant of that very important and\r\nresponsible appointment ever known--Mr. (as he then was) Lepel Griffin\r\nwas selected by the Viceroy--Lord Lytton--to proceed to Kabul, and\r\narrange for its Government as a prelude to the termination of the\r\nBritish occupation of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nUnder the Viceroyalty of Lord Lytton's successor, the Marquess of\r\nRipon, and after anxious negotiations, Abdur Rahman was proclaimed\r\nAmir of Afghanistan, July 22, 1880. In a spirit of thoroughly\r\ngood-natured banter the Gryphon's veritable \"Expedition\" from Lahore\r\nto the seat of Government to receive the Viceroy's instructions, and\r\nthereafter Afghanistan-ward to carry them out--made under very\r\ndifferent conditions from that one by Cyrus the younger--is amusingly\r\npourtrayed.\r\n\r\nTravelling through the provinces then ruled over by the late Sir\r\nGeorge Couper and Sir Robert Egerton respectively, until finally Kabul\r\nis reached, where Sir Frederick Roberts handed over his powers to the\r\nCivil authority, as embodied in the Gryphon. A progress which, as\r\nprofusely chronicled by the correspondents of the innumerable\r\nnewspapers, British, Indian, and Foreign, attracted to India by the\r\nsecond Afghan War, is lightly, yet not unkindly, satirized by\r\nAberigh-Mackay under the _nom de plums_ of \"Your Political Orphan.\"\r\nWho also in this article gave expression to the general impression of\r\nthe day, that by entrusting Mr. Lepel Griffin with the direct\r\nnegotiations, the position of the then Foreign Secretary to the\r\nGovernment of India, Mr. (now Sir) Alfred Lyall had been somewhat\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, for his undoubtedly great services, in which he was\r\nvery greatly aided by his intimate acquaintance with the Persian\r\nlanguage, still the French of Afghanistan and other Central Asian\r\nlands in diplomacy and etiquette, Mr. Griffin was created a K.C.S.I.,\r\nand shortly afterwards appointed Governor-General's Agent in Central\r\nIndia and Resident in Indore--where Aberigh-Mackay was Principal of\r\nthe Rajkumar College--the College for the \"Sons of Nobles\"--the first\r\n\"Eton\" established under British rule in India. These appointments Sir\r\nLepel held from 1881 until 1888, when he was appointed Resident at\r\nHyderabad, the last official position he held in India.\r\n\r\nThe article now under elucidation appeared on March 29 1880, in _The\r\nBombay Gazette_, then edited by the late Mr. Grattan Geary, whose\r\nnarrative of a journey from Bombay to the Bosphorus through Asiatic\r\nTurkey, published in 1878, did much to revive and stimulate interest\r\nin those important countries, where happily British trade and other\r\ninfluences are now being actively commented upon by the press of\r\nWestern India, and developed by the merchants of Bombay, Karachi, and\r\nWestern India generally.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Gibson Bowles, the proprietor of _Vanity Fair_, who had\r\nalways warmly appreciated the literary work done for him by\r\nAberigh-Mackay, about this time offered him the editorship of the\r\npaper. This post Aberigh-Mackay had virtually accepted.\r\n\r\nShortly before Sir Lepel Griffin took up his appointment as\r\nGovernor-General's Agent, gossip, more especially at Indore and in\r\nCentral and Western India, was very busy with surmises as to the fate\r\nin store for the writer of this article, as well as many other\r\nparagraphs commenting, _inter alia_, upon Afghan affairs, and, _en\r\npassant_ Mr. Lepel Griffin, which had appeared in _The Bombay Gazette_\r\nfrom February to December, 1880, under the general heading of \"Some\r\nSerious Reflections.\" These articles, hitherto anonymous, having being\r\nrepublished in book form, with their authorship avowed, at Bombay in\r\n1880, shortly before the new Resident and Governor-General's Agent\r\narrived at Indore.\r\n\r\nThe gossips were--as is nearly always the case--quite wrong, for one\r\nof the first men to extend a friendly welcome to Aberigh-Mackay when\r\nhe arrived at Lahore on the 13th August, 1869, to take up his\r\nappointment of \"Manager of the Government Zoological Collection\" was\r\nMr. Lepel Griffin, then the Deputy-Commissioner of the City and\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, at Simla and elsewhere, these two kindred spirits--in many\r\nways--met frequently, and learnt to understand each other thoroughly\r\nwell. They also had several common friends, civil, military, and\r\nnon-official; and their literary pursuits in historical directions\r\nwere also much in sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 they were not fated to meet, although Aberigh-Mackay had taken\r\nimmediate steps to endeavour to do so, as soon as he became aware that\r\na prevalent rumour was abroad to the effect that the Gryphon would--to\r\nuse a colloquialism--now make it hot for him.\r\n\r\nAberigh-Mackay indignantly repelled any such surmises, and laughed to\r\nscorn the idea that Sir Lepel could possibly entertain any revengeful\r\nthoughts of the kind that were anticipated by those who knew\r\nabsolutely nothing of the old and existing intimacies of either of the\r\ntwo men concerned.\r\n\r\nTo effectually dispel and give the lie to all such insinuations, he\r\narranged to postpone his departure for England until after the arrival\r\nof Sir Lepel Griffin at Indore, and then make patent to official and\r\nother society the true inward state of affairs.\r\n\r\nAberigh-Mackay was a very keen all-round sportsman, and in the first\r\nweeks of December, 1880, had played at Mhow and Indore in the\r\ninteresting polo matches between the 29th Regiment and the station of\r\nIndore, both matches being won by Indore, notwithstanding a good fight\r\nby the Regimental team, headed by Major Ruxton.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th January, 1881, he read and played with the Chiefs and\r\nThakores of the Rajkumar class of his College; on the evening of the\r\n8th he played lawn-tennis in the Residency garden, when he caught a\r\nchill. The next day--Sunday--symptoms of tetanus appeared which\r\ncreated anxiety among his relatives and friends. On Tuesday, the 11th\r\nJanuary, signs of imminent danger became apparent, and at 11 a.m. on\r\nWednesday, he died, some weeks before the new Governor-General's Agent\r\narrived at Indore.\r\n\r\nIt is a very pleasing fact that the most eloquent and very evidently\r\nheart-felt testimony to the great and abiding worth of Abengh-Mackay's\r\nwork at Indore and far beyond, came from the very pen of Sir Lepel\r\nGriffin in his \"Report of the Central India Agency for the Year\r\n1881-82,\" issued in July, 1883, as follows.--\r\n\r\n      'The death of Mr Aberigh-Mackay was for Central India, an\r\n      almost irreparable loss. The patience, tact, and enthusiasm\r\n      which he brought to his responsible educational duties were\r\n      worthy of all admiration and those young Chiefs who had the\r\n      benefit of his guidance will compare most favourably both in\r\n      acquirements and manners with any students trained under the\r\n      most favourable conditions in the colleges of British India.\r\n      It so happened that at the time Mr Mackay was in charge of\r\n      the Rajkumar College, a large number of important Chiefs\r\n      were minors, including the Rajah of Rutlam, the junior Chief\r\n      of Dewar, the Nawab of Jaora, and the two sons of His\r\n      Highness the Maharaja Holkar. At present there are no Chiefs\r\n      of the first rank in the Residency College. It will be well\r\n      if the earnestness and devotion which animated the work of\r\n      Mr. Abengh Mackay will be felt by those who succeed him.\r\n\r\nIn Elucidation No. 1--\"The Viceroy\"--Lord Lytton's _personal_\r\nnomination of Abengh-Mackay to a Fellowship in the Calcutta University\r\nhas been referred to. This act of _noblesse oblige,_ in the highest\r\nsense of the term, was happily known to Abengh-Mackay during his\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SOME OCCULT PHENOMENA\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1880 many strange stories were afloat in India\r\nconcerning the studies and practices of what is now widely known as\r\noccult science, indulged in and made manifest by the late Madame\r\nBlavatsky, the authoress of _Isis Unveiled,_ who claimed to possess in\r\na high degree, by nature, those attributes which spiritualists\r\ndescribe (without professing to understand) as \"mediumship\".\r\n\r\nProminent members of Anglo-Indian society associated themselves with\r\nMadame Blavatsky, supported her, and believed in the _bona fides_ of\r\nher powers, derived as Madame declared from Eastern \"adepts\" in the\r\nscience of Yog-Vidya, as this occult knowledge is called by its\r\ndevotees.\r\n\r\nA science according to some--to others a mere vulgar imposition--with\r\nwhich, as maintained by certain renowned Western exponents, Lord\r\nLytton was well versed and largely imbued, his _imagina-tive_ account\r\nof the achievements accomplished by Vril in the _Coming Race_, being,\r\naccording to the school and scholars of Madame Blavatsky, altogether\r\ninspired from that Eastern fount.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cypher Redalf, the eminent journalist,\" in the proper person of\r\nMr. A.P. Sinnett, editor of _The Pioneer_, a daily newspaper published\r\nat Allahabad, and then, as now to an increased degree, the leading\r\nEnglish newspaper in India, printed in that journal an authoritative\r\nstatement of various occurrences in Blavatskyian circles at Simla when\r\nMadame was on a visit to Mr and Mrs. Sinnett.\r\n\r\nIt is this statement, the outcome of \"the true spirit of devout\r\ninquiry ... by persons of consideration in evening dress\" which forms\r\nthe _leit motif_ of Aberigh-Mackay's powerful satire, in which a\r\ngingham umbrella, \"conceived in the liberal spirit of a bye-gone age,\"\r\nis substituted for an old fashioned breast brooch set round with\r\npearls, with glass at the front and the back, made to contain hair,\r\nwhich, long lost, was stated to have been recovered for its owner as a\r\nresult of Madame Blavatsky's occult powers.\r\n\r\nPowers made manifest at a dinner in Mr. A.O. Hume's house at Simla on\r\nSunday the 3rd of October, 1880, at which were present as guests Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Sinnett, Mrs. Gordon, Mr. F. Hogg, Captain P.J. Maitland, Mr.\r\nDavison, Colonel Olcott, and Madame Blavatsky.\r\n\r\nMost of the persons present believed that they had recently seen many\r\nremarkable occurrences in Madame Blavatsky's company, and the\r\nconversation largely turned on occult phenomena, in the course of\r\nwhich Mrs. Hume was asked by Madame if there was anything she\r\nparticularly wished for. After some hesitation Mrs. Hume replied that\r\nshe was particularly anxious to recover an old-fashioned brooch she\r\nhad formerly possessed, which she had given away to a person who had\r\nallowed it to pass out of her possession.\r\n\r\nThe brooch having been minutely described as above, and roughly\r\nsketched, Madame then wrapped up a coin attached to her watch-chain in\r\ntwo cigarette papers, and put it in her dress, and said that she hoped\r\nthe brooch might be obtained in the course of the evening.\r\n\r\nAt the close of dinner she intimated to Mr. Hume that the paper in\r\nwhich the coin had been wrapped was gone. A little later, in the\r\ndrawing-room, she said that the brooch would not be brought into the\r\nhouse, but that it must be looked for in the garden; and then, as the\r\nparty went out accompanying her, she stated that she had clairvoyantly\r\nseen the brooch fall into a star-shaped bed of flowers. Mr. Hume led\r\nthe way to such a bed in a distant part of the garden, and after a\r\nprolonged and careful search made by lantern light, a small paper\r\npacket, consisting of two cigarette papers and containing a brooch\r\nwhich Mrs. Hume identified as that which she had originally lost, was\r\nfound among the leaves by Mrs. Sinnett.\r\n\r\nAll this, and a great deal more, including the conviction of all\r\npresent that the occurrence was of an absolutely unimpeachable\r\ncharacter as an evidence of the truth of the possibility of occult\r\nphenomena, being carefully embodied in the published statements, which\r\nhad been duly read over to the party and signed. The publication of\r\nthe statement aroused a great discussion in the newspapers of the day,\r\nby no means confined to India, and gave a powerful impetus to Madame\r\nBlavatsky's views.\r\n\r\nMr. Allan Octavian Hume, happily still alive, son of Joseph Hume the\r\ngreat Radical member of Parliament, created C.B. for his very\r\ndistinguished services in the Mutiny, retired from the Indian Civil\r\nService in 1882 after a notable career in many departments.\r\nOrnithologist, and since his retirement following hereditary instincts\r\nby organizing and supporting the National Congress, and criticizing\r\nmuch of the policy of the Government of India.\r\n\r\nMr. Sinnett, the leading actor in the affair described above, not long\r\nafter the publication of the Simla narrative, ended his connection\r\nwith _The Pioneer_, and may be regarded as one of the leading spirits\r\nof the Theosophical movement, in connection with which he has written\r\nmany books, and he now holds high office in the London branch of the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A: _Lit.
