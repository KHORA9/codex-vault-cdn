But its strongest opponent is Mr. Gandhi and perhaps the most\r\nsevere check it has received is the adoption by the National Congress at\r\nhis instance in Calcutta and Nagpur of the so-called-Non-violent\r\nNon-co-operation. Non-co-operation as advocated by Mr. Gandhi may be a\r\nweapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our\r\npurpose. Non-violence and passive suffering will lead to bloodshed or be\r\nunfruitful of any satisfactory results. Moreover, nothing shows the lack\r\nof statesmanship more than practically basing the claim for Swaraj upon\r\nthe Punjab and the Khilafat grievances. As representing Asia against\r\nEurope, the fair against the white race, the Hindus regarded the Turkish\r\nEmpire with sympathy and were disposed to support the Mahomadens as\r\nAsiatic representatives. But when by Gandhi and Khilafatist that claim\r\nwas abandoned; when the Arabs perhaps the noblest of the Mahomadan races\r\nwho fought as our allies and helped us to defeat Turkey were sought to\r\nbe brought under Turkish dominion, when other Asiatic races freed by the\r\nwar were asked to accept Turkish sovereignty on grounds based on the\r\nMahomaden religion which had already produced such baneful result in\r\nIndia, the situation became entirely different. It was rightly realised\r\nby many, and the sequel has proved that they were right, that the path\r\nof the progress of the Gandhi movement fused with the Khilafat element\r\nwill be bloody. The claim for Indian Home Rule rests upon very different\r\ngrounds. The Hindus have nothing to do with the Khilafat agitation. The\r\nMahomadans themselves are not agreed as to the claims advanced on behalf\r\nof the Calif. It is even questionable, to put it mildly, whether that\r\nclaim has the support of the majority of the Mahomadans. While the claim\r\nitself rested on such slender grounds, the means first adopted to\r\nenforce the claim were grotesque. The methods advocated by Mr. Gandhi\r\nand the Congress are directed against Western civilization; against the\r\nclass which fought for and won the reforms; and the Montague reforms\r\nscheme of constitutional progress. They have failed miserably and as was\r\nnatural more violent methods leading to direct conflict with the forces\r\nof Government have been advocated which would in all probability have\r\nbeen carried out but for the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Gandhi. He\r\nbelongs to a class of thought which has attracted some of the noblest\r\nminds in this world, but in applying his the gospel of life to politics,\r\nhe has shown himself a babe and his interference has been generally\r\nmischievous. In South Africa he is responsible for creating a situation\r\nwhich makes a peaceful and satisfactory solution practically impossible.\r\nHis factious policy in India stands in the way of further reforms. The\r\nopposition to Gandhi was however not strenuous. The so-called Moderates\r\nonly whispered their protests against his policy so as not to be heard\r\nbeyond a few feet. They are loud however, in their denunciation of\r\nGovernment action to check the illegal activities of Mr. Gandhi and his\r\nfollowers. It can hardly be doubted that their cautious attitude has\r\ncontributed to the growth of the Gandhi movement. But the inexplicable\r\nconduct of a certain--I won't say class--body of gentlemen has still\r\nmore contributed to that result.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any item in the Gandhi programme which is not a\r\ncomplete violation of everything preached by the foremost sons of India\r\ntill 1919; which has not been strongly even vehemently denounced by\r\nthose old respected members of the Congress who now follow Mr. Gandhi,\r\nPandit Malaviya, Messrs. Vijayaragavachari, Lajapat Rai, Natarajam, S.\r\nKasturiranga Iyengar, the Editor of the 'Hindu.' Mr. Gandhi's emotional\r\noutbursts, fastings, penances, Sanyasi waist cloth, may carry away the\r\nemotional masses, women and students. But whether this wave of\r\nemotionalism submerged the men abovenamed I would not care to guess. No\r\none of course has any right to find fault with his genuine followers\r\nlike Mr. Prakasam, Editor, 'Swaraj' whose motives, however much we might\r\ndiffer from his politics, no one will question. He is one of those\r\ngenuine patriots who believes in the efficacy of Mr. Gandhi's methods to\r\nobtain Home Rule. By far the great majority however, follow him for\r\nother reasons.\r\n\r\nThe severe simplicity and austerity of Mr. Gandhi's life combined with\r\nhis appeal to the principle of '_Ahimsa_' non-injury inherited from\r\nBuddists and now ingrained in Hindu life, has secured him the support of\r\nthe Hindu masses and particularly vegetarians. His support of the caste\r\nsystem has won over the higher classes and the reactionary elements of\r\nHindu society to his side. The caste system is entirely opposed to the\r\n'Ahimsa' (Non-injury) principle. The former has dedicated one of the\r\nmain castes to death. Its function is to kill and be killed. It is also\r\nthe function of some of the sub-castes of the lowest caste or class to\r\nslaughter animals. His indiscriminating support of the extreme Khilafat\r\ndemands has ensured the Mahomedan support. Islam is more opposed than\r\nthe caste system to \"Ahimsa.\" The trouble with the Hindus over the\r\nslaughter of cows is due to this difficulty. Some politicians who\r\nnaturally desire to use him and the influence he has acquired for\r\nputting pressure on the Government to concede further reform, also have\r\njoined him. But I am satisfied he is using them all to further his own\r\nends. An attempt in which he is bound to fail. His success _i.e._ the\r\nsuccess of the reactionary forces in India to obtain what they call\r\nDominion status or Home Rule, but, which really means their rule, will\r\nnot only lead to bloodshed and anarchy and the dismemberment of the\r\nEmpire; but to the triumph of a reactionary policy, social, moral and\r\neconomic, against which the democratic policy of the recent reforms and\r\nthe Legislative Councils is an emphatic protest. I have attempted in the\r\nfollowing pages to give my reasons for these conclusions.\r\n\r\nFar more important than my narrative are the extracts published in the\r\nappendix. They consist of speeches made by the Viceroy, and members of\r\nGovernment in the Legislative Councils. I have on account of\r\nconsiderations of space omitted speeches in many provinces. I have not\r\ngiven any speech in full for the same reason. I have also given a list\r\nof riots or disturbances. These give a fair idea of the activities of\r\nMr. Gandhi.\r\n\r\nC. SANKARAN NAIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGANDHI AND ANARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of us are now striving for \"Swaraj\" or Home Rule. We wish to be\r\nmasters of our own destiny. We want sooner or later the representatives\r\nof the people of the country to govern it. There are some amongst us who\r\nconsider that Home Rule, is an immediate necessity. Others believe that\r\nHome Rule, at present without the fulfilment of certain preliminary\r\nconditions would be attended with disastrous results. But all are agreed\r\nthat we should work for it. The practical difficulties in the way of its\r\nattainment due, partly to the relations between the various communities\r\nin India, partly to the opposition of powerful interests and the period\r\nthat must therefore elapse before we overcome them render the discussion\r\nof time, ignoring or brushing aside those difficulties, only of academic\r\ninterest. Mr. Gandhi's great influence is due to the popular belief in\r\nthe efficacy of his leadership to attain immediate Home Rule. To me his\r\nNon-Co-operation Campaign appears to be an egregious blunder for which\r\nwe are already paying dearly. A long line of illustrious statesmen,\r\nIndian and English have just succeeded in leading us out of the house of\r\nbondage. How long we shall have to wander in the deserts we do not know.\r\nBut it is certain that Mr. Gandhi is not leading his followers in the\r\ndirection of the promised land. He is not only going in the opposite\r\ndirection but instead of toughening our fibre by a life of toil and\r\nstruggle is endeavouring to entirely emasculate us and render us\r\naltogether unfit for the glorious destiny that, but for him and others\r\nlike him, is awaiting us.\r\n\r\nThis will be clear once the nature of his agitation is realised. For\r\nthat purpose, it is necessary to understand his mentality and his real\r\nviews on the problems of life and the various questions now in debate.\r\n\r\nThese are given in various books which have been published and in his\r\npaper \"Young India\", edited by him. His \"Indian Home Rule\", was first\r\npublished in 1908. In a publication of 1921, he says \"I withdraw nothing\r\nexcept one word of it and that in deference to a lady friend.\" The\r\nreason is the indelicacy of the expression....\r\n\r\nThe book is in the form of a dialogue between a Reader and the \"Editor\"\r\nthe latter being Gandhi himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi wishes to know the necessity of driving away the English,\r\n\r\n _Reader_:--\"Because India has become impoverished by their Government.\r\n They take away our money from year to year. The most important posts\r\n are reserved for themselves. We are kept in a state of slavery. They\r\n behave insolently towards us, and disregard our feelings.\"\r\n\r\n _Gandhi_:--\"Supposing we get Self-government similar to what the\r\n Canadians and South Africans have, will it be good enough?\"\r\n\r\n _Reader_:--\"That question also is useless. We may get it when we have\r\n the same powers. We shall then hoist our own flag. As is Japan so must\r\n India be. We must own our navy, our army, and we must have our own\r\n splendour. Then will India's voice ring throughout the world.\"\r\n\r\n _Gandhi_:--\"You have well drawn the picture. In effect it means this:\r\n that we want English Rule without the Englishman. You want the tiger's\r\n nature but not the tiger; that is to say you would make India English\r\n and when it becomes English, it will be called not Hindustan but\r\n Englistan. _This is not the Swaraj that I want._\"\r\n\r\nNothing can be clearer. He does not want\r\nthe dominion status of Canada or South Africa\r\nfor India. He does not claim the independence\r\nof Japan for India as he points out a few lines\r\nbelow, \"What you call swaraj is not truly\r\nswaraj.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is then the real \"Swaraj\" according\r\nto Mr. Gandhi? He proceeds to develop his\r\nviews by illustrations.\r\n\r\nHe gives his views on the poverty of India.\r\nHe says Railways, Lawyers and Doctors have\r\nimpoverished the country, so much so that, if\r\nwe do not wake up in time, we shall be ruined.\r\n\r\nAbout railways he says as follows:--\r\n\r\n \"Man is so made by nature as to require him to restrict his movements\r\n as far as his hands and feet will take him. If we did not rush about\r\n from place to place by means of railways and such other maddening\r\n conveniences, much of the confusion that arises, would be obviated. Our\r\n difficulties are of our own creation. God set a limit to a man's\r\n locomotive ambition in the construction of his body. Man immediately\r\n proceeded to discover means of overriding the limit. God gifted man\r\n with intellect that he might know his Maker. Man abused it so that he\r\n might forget his Maker. I am so constructed that I can only serve my\r\n immediate neighbours, but in my conceit, I pretend to have discovered\r\n that I must with my body serve every individual in the Universe. In\r\n thus attempting the impossible, man comes in contact with different\r\n religions and is utterly confounded. According to this reasoning, it\r\n must be apparent to you that railways are a most dangerous institution.\r\n Man has gone further away from his Maker\".\r\n\r\nAnd he advises all his friends to go into the interior of the country\r\nthat has yet not been polluted by the railways and live there in order\r\nto be patriotic.\r\n\r\nI shall not insult the intelligence of my reader by attempting a defence\r\nof the railways which have knit India together. I will only observe that\r\naccording to Mr. Gandhi, the construction and use of railways for\r\nlocomotion not possible for man in his natural condition, is an abuse of\r\nGod's gift. And why? Because if he comes into contact with different\r\nnatures, with different religions he might try to serve others than his\r\nneighbour whom alone God intended him to serve!!!\r\n\r\nAs to lawyers, he will have none of them; without lawyers, courts could\r\nnot have been established or conducted and without them the British\r\ncould not hold India. He has yet to learn that there were courts both in\r\npre-British India and British India before lawyers. He thinks the\r\nHindu-Mahomedan quarrels have often been due to the intervention of\r\nlawyers. He wants all people to settle their own quarrels; \"men were\r\nless unmanly if they settled their disputes either by fighting or by\r\nasking their relatives to decide them. They became more unmanly and\r\ncowardly when they resorted to the Courts of Law. It is a sign of\r\nsavagery to settle disputes by fighting. It is not the less so by asking\r\na third party to decide between you and me. The parties alone know who\r\nis right and therefore they ought to settle it\". Such is his opinion of\r\nlawyers and of Courts.\r\n\r\nHe is even more harsh on doctors. His opinion is quoted below as any\r\nstatement of it in my own words might be regarded as travesty:--\r\n\r\n \"Let us consider; the business of a doctor is to take care of the body,\r\n or, properly speaking, not even that. Their business is really to rid\r\n the body of diseases that may afflict. How do these diseases arise?\r\n Surely by our negligence or indulgence. I overeat, I have indigestion,\r\n I go to a doctor, he gives me medicine. I am cured, I overeat again,\r\n and I take his pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first\r\n instance, I would have suffered the punishment deserved by me, and I\r\n would not have over-eaten again. The doctor intervened and helped me to\r\n indulge myself. My body thereby certainly felt more at ease, but my\r\n mind became weakened. A continuance of a course of medicine must,\r\n therefore, result in loss of a control over the mind.\r\n\r\n \"I have indulged in vice, I contract a disease, a doctor cures me, the\r\n odds are that I shall repeat the vice. Had the doctor not intervened,\r\n nature would have done its work, and I would have acquired mastery over\r\n myself, would have been freed from vice, and would have become happy.\r\n\r\n \"Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin. Men take less care of\r\n their bodies, and immorality increases\".\r\n\r\n He says therefore that a doctor should \"give up medicine, and\r\n understand that rather than mending bodies, he should mend souls\", and\r\n he must also understand that \"if, by not taking drugs, perchance the\r\n patient dies, the world will not come to grief and he will have been\r\n really useful to him\".\r\n\r\nThere is no use in arguing with him and his dupes on this subject after\r\nthis. But his views must be borne in mind when we come to deal with the\r\npresent agitation.\r\n\r\nAbout education, his views are equally remarkable. If, he says,\r\neducation simply means knowledge of letters it is merely an instrument\r\nand an instrument may be well used or abused. He adds:--\r\n\r\n \"We daily observe that many men abuse it and very few make good use of\r\n it\".\r\n\r\nHe will not give any education to a raiyat or poor peasant:--\r\n\r\n \"The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge of letters. To teach\r\n boys reading, writing and arithmetic is called primary education\".\r\n\r\n \"What do you propose to do by giving him a knowledge of letters? Will\r\n you add an inch to his happiness? Do you wish to make him discontented\r\n with his cottage or his lot?\"\r\n\r\nSo much for primary education. As to higher education he says he has\r\nlearnt Geography, Astronomy, Algebra, Geometry etc., but neither has\r\nthat learning benefited him nor any body about him. As to knowledge of\r\nEnglish, it is only useful to enslave people:--\r\n\r\n \"The foundation that Macaulay laid of education\", he says: \"has\r\n enslaved us. It is worth noting that by receiving English education, we\r\n have enslaved the nation. Hypocrisy, tyranny etc. have increased;\r\n English-knowing Indians have not hesitated to cheat and strike terror\r\n into the people. Now, if we are doing anything for the people at all,\r\n we are paying only a portion of the debt due to them\".\r\n\r\nI shall have to deal with this question of education later in connection\r\nwith this appeal to the boys to leave the schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, it will not surprise any one to be told that we must\r\nhave nothing to do with machinery:--\r\n\r\n \"It was not that we did not know how to invent machinery, but our\r\n forefathers knew that, if we set our hearts after such things, we would\r\n become slaves and lose our moral fibre. They, therefore, after due\r\n deliberation, decided that we should only do what we could with our\r\n hands and feet. They saw that our real happiness and health consisted\r\n in a proper use of our hands and feet.\"\r\n\r\nHe would not therefore have mills for the reason that machinery is the\r\nchief symbol of modern civilisation and it has already begun to desolate\r\nEurope. In his opinion it were better for us to send money to Manchester\r\nand to use flimsy Manchester cloth than to multiply mills in India. I\r\nwonder why he does not ask Lancashire to pay him his crore of rupees.\r\nLancashire would no doubt do so in consideration of the monopoly of\r\nsupplying India with manufactured goods and India would, according to\r\nMr. Gandhi, get Swaraj. India does not want manufactured goods; he\r\nasks:--\r\n\r\n \"What did India do before these articles were introduced? Precisely the\r\n same should be done to-day. As long as we cannot make pins without\r\n machinery, so long will we do without them. The tinsel splendour of\r\n glassware we will have nothing to do with, and we will make wick, as of\r\n old, with home grown cotton, and use hand-made earthen saucers for\r\n Lamps\". He finally adds: \"I cannot recall a single good point in\r\n connection with machinery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi wrote his book in 1908 after a visit to England when the\r\nLiberal and the Labour parties were carrying on their great campaign in\r\nfavour of the working men and against the capitalists and Lloyd George\r\nwas about to launch his great land campaign. He seems to have been\r\nimpressed with the horrors of the condition of the wage earners which\r\nwas then portrayed in dark colours in order to support that campaign.\r\nHis mind, emotional and ill balanced, seems to have been entirely upset\r\nby the descriptions that he had then read. He is on the fringe of a\r\nlarge question about which he seems to have been singularly ill\r\ninformed. In England there is not at this time and there was not when he\r\nwrote, any question of the destruction of machinery which is a necessary\r\nadjunct to the industrial system. The questions under debate are the\r\nconditions of labour and the distribution of the wealth created by\r\nmachinery between capitalists and labour. These questions have been\r\nunder consideration now for some years; the condition of the labourers\r\nis being slowly improved, a minimum wage has been introduced and there\r\nis a prospect of a still more equitable distribution of the proceeds\r\nbetween capital and labour. Mr. Gandhi says that he has read Dutt's book\r\non the decline of Indian industries but he does not seem to have learnt\r\nthe lesson inculcated therein--that it is necessary to improve our\r\nindustries not only to meet the needs of the people of the country, find\r\nemployment for our labouring population, but also not to force them to\r\ncompete with the cultivating classes. In India the same problem as in\r\nEngland awaits us. We have to see that the condition of the labourers in\r\nthe mills and in the other industries is improved. In asking for the\r\nruin of all our manufacturing industries Mr. Gandhi is only playing into\r\nthe hands of our opponents. He will find strong support in this respect\r\nfrom Lancashire who will, according to some Indian publicists, only be\r\ntoo willing to take any steps to effect the destruction of our competing\r\nindustries. If he had directed half the energy of his non-co-operation\r\ncampaign to improving the conditions of the workmen in all our\r\nindustries he might possibly have succeeded in getting rid of many of\r\nthose evils which in his opinion require elimination of all machinery\r\nand of all industrial undertakings. The other reason for the deplorable\r\ncondition of the industrial workmen in England is the congestion and\r\novercrowding, in the industrial centres. This is due to a great extent\r\nto the action of the landlords who will not allow any expansion of those\r\nindustrial centres in order to increase the value of their land and thus\r\nto exploit the community. In India we have not got that trouble. There\r\nis ample room for extension except in Bombay, in all the industrial\r\ncentres and even in Bombay the difficulty is not due, so far as I am\r\ninformed to the action of landlords but to natural conditions arising\r\nout of the geography of Bombay. Machinery is essential to the creation\r\nof wealth by manufacturing industries. The evils that have been\r\nportrayed by Mr. Gandhi can be and are being removed by patient effort.\r\nHis tirade against machinery and mill industries on account of the evils\r\nhe has witnessed in the West, is due to his ignorance; a little\r\nknowledge in his case has proved a dangerous thing. It is this feeling\r\nwhich has led him to advocate the universal use of spinning wheel in\r\nIndia. This might be useful as a cottage or home industry. It might find\r\nwork for some who would otherwise be idle. But he is living in a fool's\r\nparadise if he considers it a substitute for or will supplant, machinery.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that he hates Parliaments:--\r\n\r\n \"The condition of England at present is pitiable. I pray to God that\r\n India may never be in that plight. That which you consider to be Mother\r\n of Parliaments is like a sterile woman and a prostitute. Both these are\r\n harsh terms, but exactly fit the case. That Parliament has not yet of\r\n its own accord done a single good thing; hence I have compared it to a\r\n sterile woman. The natural condition of that Parliament is such that\r\n without out-side pressure it can do nothing. It is like a prostitute\r\n because it is under the control of ministers who change from time to\r\n time. To-day it is under Mr. Asquith; tomorrow it may be under Mr.\r\n Balfour.\"\r\n\r\n \"If the money and the time wasted by Parliament were entrusted to a few\r\n good men, the English nation would be occupying to-day a much higher\r\n platform. The Parliament is simply a costly toy of the nation. These\r\n views are by no means peculiar to me. Some great English thinkers have\r\n expressed them.\r\n\r\n \"That you cannot accept my views at once is only right. If you will\r\n read the literature on this subject, you will have some idea of it. The\r\n Parliament is without a real master, under the Prime Minister, its\r\n movement is not steady, but it is buffeted about like a prostitute. The\r\n Prime Minister is more concerned about his power than about the welfare\r\n of the Parliament. His energy is concentrated upon securing the success\r\n of his party. His care is not always that the Parliament shall do\r\n right. Prime Ministers are known to have made the Parliament do things\r\n merely for party advantage. All this is worth thinking over.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that he called upon all his followers to boycott the\r\nIndian Councils. I shall deal with this when dealing with the boycott\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAfter all this one would naturally think that if we expel the English\r\nfrom India we would be happy. Not a bit, says Mr. Gandhi whose views\r\nabout independence are peculiar. Look, he says, at Italy. He thinks that\r\nItaly has not gained anything by independence of Austrian domination. He\r\nadds:--\r\n\r\n \"If you believe that because Italians hold Italy, the Italian nation is\r\n happy, you are groping in darkness. What substantial gain did Italy\r\n obtain after the withdrawal of the Austrian troops? The gain is only\r\n nominal. You do not want therefore to reproduce the same conditions in\r\n India. India to gain her independence can fight like Italy only when\r\n she has arms and in order to gain her independence India has to be\r\n armed and to arm India on a large scale is to Europeanise it. Then her\r\n condition will be just as pitiable as that of Europe. This means in\r\n short, that India must accept European civilisation ... but the fact is\r\n that the Indian nation will not adopt arms and it is well that she does\r\n not.\"\r\n\r\nShe must not therefore use force to fight the English.\r\n\r\nBut what is it she has to do. She must obtain Swaraj or Home Rule by\r\n'soul force'. What is it?:--\r\n\r\n \"When we are slaves we think that the whole universe is enslaved.\r\n Because we are in an abject condition, we think that the whole of India\r\n is in that condition. As a matter of fact, it is not so, but it is as\r\n well to impute our slavery to the whole of India. But if we bear in\r\n mind the above fact we can see that if we become free, India is free.\r\n And in this thought you have definition of 'swaraj.' It is 'swaraj'\r\n when we earn to rule ourselves. It is therefore in the palm of our\r\n hands. Do not consider this 'swaraj' to be like a dream. Hence there is\r\n no idea of sitting still. The 'swaraj' that I wish to picture before\r\n you and me is such that, after we have once realised it, we will\r\n endeavour to the end of our lifetime to persuade others to do likewise.\r\n But such 'swaraj' has to be experienced by each one for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe assumption made by a few persons that Mr. Gandhi is only condemning\r\nparliamentary government for its inutility is unfounded. The extracts\r\nalready given might lend some colour to that view. But such is not the\r\nfact. In England Parliamentary government is denounced by certain\r\npersons on the ground that it will always be under the influence of a\r\ncapitalist Press and therefore unable to redress the evils from which\r\nthe people of the country other than the capitalists are suffering. Mr.\r\nGandhi's objection is not based on any such ground; he is against not\r\nonly Parliamentary Government but practically against any Government in\r\nany form as is apparent from the extracts given above. The doctrine that\r\nGovernments have very little to do with our happiness which depends upon\r\nself-control or 'soul force' has many advocates, but to deduce it as a\r\ndoctrine from the alleged failure of Parliamentary Government in England\r\nis ludicrous. I shall not stop here to justify Parliamentary government\r\nwhich has justified itself by its results; it is only ignorance of the\r\nwork that has been done which is responsible for opinions like those to\r\nwhich Mr. Gandhi has given expression.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the book he says:--\r\n\r\n Before I leave you, I will take the liberty of repeating:--\r\n\r\n 1. Real Home Rule is Self Rule or control;\r\n\r\n 2. The way to it is Passive Resistance; that is soul force or love\r\n force.\r\n\r\n In my opinion, we have used the term \"Swaraj\" without understanding its\r\n real significance. I have endeavoured to explain it as I understand it,\r\n and my conscience testifies that _my life henceforth is dedicated to\r\n its attainment_.\r\n\r\nSuch is the real Gandhi. Railways, lawyers, courts, doctors, education\r\non Western lines, machinery of every kind or manufacturing industries,\r\nparliamentary government should disappear. He is singularly ill informed\r\non every one of the questions he has discussed. 'Soul force' alone\r\nshould be relied upon. No resistance should be offered to violence. No\r\nresistance should be offered to robbery and the robbers are to be left\r\nto cut one another's throats. No resistance to be offered to murderers\r\nor to those who might want to enslave you. Briefly, no protection is to\r\nbe given by laws and their administrators to person and property.\r\n\r\nThere is no harm perhaps as long as such fantastic visionaries restrict\r\nthe application of these principles to themselves, to their own persons\r\nor properties. But it becomes a serious matter when their general\r\napplication is sought for.\r\n\r\nThese are the sentiments he expressed in 1908, and it was with these\r\nsentiments that he came to India. As it is well to be definite and\r\nclear, I will quote from a letter addressed by him in 1909 to a friend\r\nin India:--\r\n\r\n \"Bombay, Calcutta and the other chief cities of India are the real\r\n plague spots\".\r\n\r\n \"If British rule were replaced tomorrow by Indian rule based on modern\r\n methods, India would be no better, except that she would be able then\r\n to retain some of the money that is drained away to England; but then\r\n India would only become a second or fifth nation of Europe or America\".\r\n\r\n \"Medical science is the concentrated essence of black magic. Quackery\r\n is infinitely preferable to what passes for high medical skill\".\r\n\r\n \"Hospitals are the instruments that the devil has been using for his\r\n own purpose, in order to keep his hold on his kingdom. They perpetuate\r\n vice, misery and degradation and real slavery\".\r\n\r\n \"India's salvation consists in unlearning what she has learnt during\r\n the past fifty years. The railways, telegraphs, hospitals, lawyers,\r\n doctors, and such like have all to go, and so called upper classes have\r\n to learn to live consciously and religiously and deliberately the\r\n simple peasant life, knowing it to be a life giving true happiness\".\r\n\r\nBut he soon found that it was hopeless to carry out his theories in the\r\nface of the determination of the people of India to attain Home Rule\r\npreached by the Indian National Congress and the Indian politicians. He\r\nhad accordingly to put on a new garb. Therefore, in 1917, the year of\r\nthe famous declaration made by the British Government about the\r\nprogressive realisation of self government, he found it necessary, to\r\nobtain a hearing, to accept the Home Rule programme. In his Presidential\r\naddress at the First Gujarat Political Conference in 1917 he said that\r\nwithout going into the merits of the scheme of reforms approved by the\r\nCongress and the Muslim League he will do all that is necessary to get\r\nit accepted and enforced. Though the scheme itself is not 'swaraj', he\r\nadmitted it was a great step towards 'swaraj'. At the same time he said\r\nthat though he is acting on the propriety of the current trend of\r\nthought it does not appear to him to be tending altogether in the right\r\ndirection as the 'swaraj' put forward is one of Western type.\r\nNevertheless as India is being governed in accordance with the Western\r\nsystem and without Parliament we should be nowhere, he does not hesitate\r\nto take part in the Parliamentary swaraj movement and the programme that\r\nhe sketched out for himself may be described thus in his own words\r\nwritten in 1921:--\r\n\r\n \"But I would warn the reader against thinking that I am to-day aiming\r\n at the Swaraj therein (spiritual swaraj as described in his 'Indian\r\n Home Rule'), I know that India is not ripe for it. It may seem an\r\n impertinence to say so. But such is my conviction. I am individually\r\n working for the self-rule pictured therein. But to-day my corporate\r\n activity is undoubtedly devoted to the attainment of Parliamentary\r\n Swaraj in accordance with the wishes of the people of India. I am not\r\n aiming at destroying railways or hospitals, though I would certainly\r\n welcome their natural destruction. Neither railways nor hospitals are a\r\n test of a high and pure civilisation. At best they are a necessary\r\n evil. Neither adds one inch to the moral stature of a nation. Nor am I\r\n aiming at a permanent destruction of law courts, much as I regard it as\r\n 'a consummation devoutly to be wished for,' still less am I trying to\r\n destroy all machinery and mills. It requires a higher simplicity and\r\n renunciation than the people are to-day prepared for\".\r\n\r\nHe also admitted that his acceptance of Parliamentary Swaraj required\r\nsome modification of his theory of using violence or force. He admitted\r\nthat though there is no scope for violence or force in spiritual swaraj,\r\nand military training is intended only for those who do not believe in\r\nit, he was prepared to accept the view that the whole of India will\r\nnever accept Satyagraha. He added:--\r\n\r\n \"Not to defend the weak is an entirely effeminate idea, everywhere to\r\n be rejected. In order to protect our innocent sister from the brutal\r\n designs of a man we ought to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice and by\r\n the force of Love conquer the brute in the man. But if we have not\r\n attained that power, we would certainly use up all our bodily strength\r\n in order to frustrate those designs. The votaries of soul force and\r\n brute force are both soldiers. The latter, bereft of his arms,\r\n acknowledges defeat, the former does not know what defeat is\".\r\n\r\nIt was a consequence of this acceptance of Parliamentary Swaraj that he\r\nshould try to work the Montagu Chelmsford Council reforms. Though these\r\nreforms may be inadequate yet for one who accepts the goal of\r\nParliamentary Government it was his bounden duty to avail himself of the\r\navailable Parliamentary scheme to carry out those reforms which were\r\nthen possible and to take the necessary steps to enlarge the scope of\r\nthe scheme to carry out the further reforms that might be needed.\r\nAccordingly at the Amritsar Congress in December 1919, he resolved to\r\nco-operate with the country in working the Reform Scheme.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that he entirely disagreed with the system of\r\nParliamentary government and his acceptance was one of necessity. At the\r\nearliest opportunity at the special sessions of the Indian National\r\nCongress held at Calcutta in September 1920 and at the National Congress\r\nheld at Nagpur in December 1920 he took steps to destroy the Montagu\r\nReform Scheme of Parliamentary Swaraj and everything else to which he\r\nhad given a reluctant assent and to bring the country to adopt his wild\r\ntheories already stated by me and in order to do so, he brought into\r\nprominence forces entirely opposed to his own principles which he proved\r\nhimself unable to control with disastrous consequences and had to resort\r\nwillingly or unwillingly to dishonest methods.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason for his throwing overboard the Montagu Reform\r\nScheme? The following resolution which at his insistence was passed by\r\nthe National Congress at Calcutta and practically re-affirmed at Nagpur\r\nwill explain the situation as then developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NON-CO-OPERATION RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n \"In view of the fact that on the Khilafat question both the Indian and\r\n Imperial Governments have signally failed in their duty towards the\r\n Musalmans of India, and the Prime Minister has deliberately broken his\r\n pledged word given to them, and that it is the duty of every non-Moslem\r\n Indian in every legitimate manner to assist his Musalman brother in his\r\n attempt to remove the religious calamity that has over taken him:--\r\n\r\n \"And in view of the fact that in the matter of the events of the April\r\n 1919 both the said Governments have grossly neglected or failed to\r\n protect the innocent people of the Punjab and punish officers guilty of\r\n unsoldierly and barbarous behaviour towards them and have exonerated\r\n Sir Michael O'Dwyer who proved himself directly or indirectly\r\n responsible for the most official crimes and callous to the sufferings\r\n of the people placed under his administration, and that the debate in\r\n the House of Lords betrayed a woeful lack of sympathy with the people\r\n of India and showed virtual support of the systematic terrorism and\r\n frightfulness adopted in the Punjab and that the latest Viceregal\r\n pronouncement is proof of entire absence of repentance in the matters\r\n of the Khilafat and the Punjab.\r\n\r\n \"This Congress is of opinion that there can be no contentment in India\r\n without redress of the two afore-mentioned wrongs, and that the only\r\n effectual means to vindicate national honour and to prevent a\r\n repetition of similar wrongs in future is the establishment of\r\n Swarajya. This Congress is further of opinion that there is no course\r\n left open for the people of India but to approve of and adopt the\r\n policy of progressive non-violent non-co-operation until the said\r\n wrongs are righted and Swarajya is established.\r\n\r\n \"And inasmuch as a beginning should be made by the classes who have\r\n hitherto moulded and represented opinion and inasmuch as Government\r\n consolidates its power through titles and honours bestowed on the\r\n people, through schools controlled by it, its law courts and its\r\n legislative councils, and inasmuch as it is desirable in the\r\n prosecution of the movement to take the minimum risk and to call for\r\n the least sacrifice compatible with the attainment of the desired\r\n object, this Congress earnestly advises:--\r\n\r\n (_a_) surrender of titles and honorary offices and resignation from\r\n nominated seats in local bodies;\r\n\r\n (_b_) refusal to attend Government Levees, Durbars and other official\r\n and semi-official functions held by Government officials or in their\r\n honour;\r\n\r\n (_c_) gradual withdrawal of children from Schools and colleges owned,\r\n aided or controlled by Government and in place of such schools and\r\n colleges in the establishment of National Schools and Colleges in the\r\n various Provinces;\r\n\r\n (_d_) gradual boycott of British Courts by lawyers and litigants and\r\n establishment of private arbitration courts by their aid for the\r\n settlement of private disputes;\r\n\r\n (_e_) refusal on the part of the military, clerical and labouring\r\n classes to offer themselves as recruits for service in Mesopotamia;\r\n\r\n (_f_) withdrawal by candidates of their candidature for election to the\r\n Reformed Councils and refusal on the part of the voters for any\r\n candidate who may despite the Congress advice offer himself for\r\n election; and\r\n\r\n (_g_) the boycott of foreign goods.\r\n\r\n \"And inasmuch as non-co-operation has been conceived of as a measure of\r\n discipline and self-sacrifice without which no nation can make real\r\n progress, and inasmuch as an opportunity should be given in the very\r\n first stage of non-co-operation to every man, woman and child, for such\r\n discipline and self-sacrifice, this Congress advises adoption of\r\n Swadeshi in piece goods on a vast scale, and inasmuch as the existing\r\n mills of India with indigenous capital and control do not manufacture\r\n sufficient yarn and sufficient cloth for the requirements of the\r\n nation, and are not likely to do so for a long time to come this\r\n Congress advises immediate stimulation of further manufacture on a\r\n large scale by means of reviving hand-spinning in every home and hand\r\n weaving on the part of the millions of weavers who have abandoned their\r\n ancient and honourable calling for want of encouragement.\"\r\n\r\nThe Khilafat question first, the Punjab wrongs next are given as the two\r\ngrounds for discarding the Reform Scheme and demanding Swarajya or\r\nimmediate Home Rule for the prevention of similar wrongs in future. For\r\nthe attainment of such Swarajya or immediate Home Rule a policy of what\r\nis called non-violent non-co-operation is advocated and as a beginning\r\nthe people are advised to take certain steps which are therein referred\r\nto. Though discarding the Montagu Chelmsford Reform Scheme of Home Rule\r\nby certain stages, Mr. Gandhi says he is working for immediate Home Rule\r\nin accordance with the Resolution, to me it seems clear what he is\r\nreally aiming at is not Home Rule of any kind or form _i.e._\r\nParliamentary Government with absolute powers, but Swarajya or Home\r\nRule, as he himself has outlined it in his Indian Home Rule, the purport\r\nof which I have briefly given above, _i.e._ anarchy and soul force. I\r\nshall now attempt to show that there were no adequate reasons to discard\r\nthe Reform Scheme of Home Rule for a scheme of immediate Home Rule and\r\nthat the steps proposed to be taken are not calculated to attain Home\r\nRule of any kind or form but are steps intended for Gandhi Swarajya\r\nwhich means anarchy or soul force.\r\n\r\nIn considering these questions the object of this movement must not be\r\nlost sight of. In Mr. Gandhi's own words \"Non-co-operation though a\r\nreligious and strictly moral movement deliberately aims at the overthrow\r\nof the Government.\" Prima facie therefore all steps taken in pursuance\r\nof this resolution are intended for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI propose first of all to take up the Khilafat question which stands\r\nfirst in the Resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KHILAFAT QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to this Khilafat agitation it is important to bear this\r\nin mind. After the armistice of 1918, there were two memorials presented\r\non behalf of Turkey by the Muslim residents in England, one in January\r\n1919 soon after the armistice, which included the names of His Highness\r\nthe Aga Khan, Abbas Ali Baig, Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Messrs: Yusaf Ali, H.\r\nK. Kidwai etc.; and one at the end of the year in December 1919, the\r\nsignatories thereof included such Mahomedans as the following: H. H. Aga\r\nKhan, Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Hon. Mr. Bhurgi, Mr. M. H. Kidwai. Both\r\nincluded many non-Mahomedans, some of them of great influence and\r\nposition. They claimed for Turkey, Constantinople, Thrace, Anatolia\r\nincluding Smyrna. There was no claim for the countries occupied by those\r\nwho were not Turks.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Mahomedan claim went much further. By the deputation to the\r\nViceroy towards the end of that year and by the subsequent deputation to\r\nthe Prime Minister and others the claim was advanced for the restoration\r\nof Turkey to the pre-war state, giving Home Rule if necessary to the\r\nArmenians or the Arabs etc. under Turkish sovereignty. This of course\r\nwas an impossible demand. The Arabs are entitled to as much\r\nconsideration as the Turks. Mahomad Ali and Shaukat Ali are really\r\nresponsible for this claim.\r\n\r\nAnother claim advocated in the Council of State in India was to let\r\nTurkey have Anatolia and Thrace; full independence be given to the Arabs\r\nand the countries inhabited by them without any control by any\r\nnon-muslim power. Whether the evacuation of Aden is included in this, I\r\nam unable to say.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Mahomedan agitation has become a danger to the State on\r\naccount of the failure of the Secretary of State and Government of India\r\nto tell the Indian Mahomedans that they, the Government have nothing to\r\ndo with the Khilafat question; that their responsibility is confined to\r\nrepresenting to the British cabinet the feelings of the Indian\r\nMahomedans, and the ultimate decision will depend upon what is good for\r\nthe Empire as a whole.\r\n\r\nBut so far as Gandhi was concerned the position is quite clear. He puts\r\nforward whichever is the most extreme demand made by the Khilafat party\r\nwithout any enquiry as to their reasonableness. He relies upon a\r\n'promise' made by Lloyd George in favour of Turkey about their home\r\nlands and Thrace discarding at the same time the limitation contained in\r\nthe promise to the subject races that they will not again be placed\r\nunder Turkey. He relies upon another statement made by Lloyd George that\r\nafter this, recruitment went up. The fact is that the recruitment of non\r\nMahomedans also went up and both were due to Sir Michael O'Dwyer. Though\r\nhe now denies having insisted upon the evacuation of Egypt by England as\r\na necessary condition of satisfaction of the Khilafat claim, he insists\r\nupon the withdrawal of the Indian troops. For what purpose he does not\r\nexplain nor does he say whether he wants England to evacuate Egypt. He\r\nknows, I presume, that Egypt has repudiated the Caliph's authority. He\r\nwas not apparently aware that the Arabs will not recognize the supremacy\r\nof any Turkish power. But this is no difficulty to him. For if that\r\nturns out to be the case he says the Arab Chief who held sway over Mecca\r\nand Medina might become the Khalif. That Syria is not under England did\r\nnot matter. He wants the non-co-operators to be satisfied by England\r\nthat she was not in any way responsible for the French occupation or\r\nretention of Syria, in which case he is willing to excuse her. He fails\r\nto appreciate the weight of what appears to be an insuperable objection\r\nthat the Turks and their Khalif do not want any domination over Arabia\r\nbut, as they said in their deputation in January-February, 1919, after\r\nthe armistice, only wanted to be left alone with economic and political\r\nindependence in their own ethnological area. Neither Mr. Gandhi nor the\r\nKhilafat advocates show any realisation of this fact. With a light heart\r\nthey maintain that the question is not Turkish but Mahomedan and\r\ntherefore Turkish opinion alone cannot decide the question. Palestine,\r\nof course, according to Mr. Gandhi, must be under Turkish sovereignty.\r\nIt is enough for him that the prophet of Arabia has so willed it. The\r\nprophets of Israel or the founder of Christianity, Jewish or Christian\r\nsentiments, are as nothing in the balance. The real truth of course is\r\nthat in the case of the Khilafat agitation Mr. Gandhi and some of its\r\nmost active and prominent leaders want to use the agitation to destroy\r\nthe Government and not to effect a real settlement of the question. The\r\nmost energetic of the promoters of the movement were Mohomed Ali and\r\nShaukat Ali. They were active members of the Muslim League advocating\r\nMahomedan interests in opposition to the Hindus in the old days of the\r\nBengal Partition agitation. In their public speeches they emphasised the\r\nidentity of the interests of the Indian Mahomedans with the interests of\r\nthe Mahomedans elsewhere in Tripoli and Algeria in preference to those\r\nof the Hindus, though living under the same Government with them. Since\r\nthe Balkan wars, however, on account of their intense hatred towards the\r\nBritish Government for their failure to assist their co-religionists in\r\nthe West, they found it politic to approach the Hindus. Then followed\r\nthe internment of the brothers which naturally still more embittered\r\ntheir feelings towards the Government. During the internment they did\r\nnot cease to preach sermons of virulence against the Government, and\r\neven after their release they did not cease their propaganda of hatred\r\nagainst the British Government. The independence of India--no doubt as a\r\npreliminary step towards a subsequent Mahomedan domination in India--was\r\nas much their object as the full restoration of the Khilafat domination\r\nto its pre-war condition. This was avowed by the Ali Brothers\r\nthemselves. Mr. Shaukat Ali said in April 1920:--\r\n\r\n \"We do not embark on this step without fully realising what it means.\r\n It means a movement for absolute independence.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, to those who know them or who have read the proceedings of\r\ntheir trial no evidence of this kind is required.\r\n\r\nAt the Khilafat Conference in Karachi--of which they were the guiding\r\nspirits--held on the 9th of July 1921 the following resolution calling\r\nupon the Mohomedan sepoys to desert in the name of religion was passed:\r\n\r\n \"The meeting clearly proclaims that it is in every way religiously\r\n unlawful for a Mussalman at the present movement to continue in the\r\n British Army or to induce others to join the army, and it is the duty\r\n of all the Mussalmans in general and Ulemas in particular to see that\r\n these religious commandments are brought home to every Mussalman in the\r\n army and that if no settlement is arrived at before Christmas regarding\r\n our campaign an Indian republic will be declared at the Ahmedabad\r\n sessions of the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe two brothers were tried and convicted by the ordinary civil courts,\r\nand the judge pointed out that however lawful and constitutional the\r\nKhilafat committee may have been in its origin, however permissible the\r\nagitation carried on in its earlier stages, those who were controlling\r\nit soon began to rely on dangerous religious propaganda. About them he\r\nsaid: \"They had seen them in Court, heard their statements in the Lower\r\nCourt and their speeches here, and they could have no doubt that with\r\nthe exception of accused No. Six (a Hindu) they openly gloried in their\r\nhatred of the Government of India and the British name. They justified\r\nthe above resolution by the religious law of the Koran which they said\r\nthe Mussalmans are bound to follow even when opposed to the law of the\r\nland. All the Mohamedans in this case including Mohamad Ali and Shaukat\r\nAli maintained, 'first, that their religion compels them to do certain\r\nacts, secondly, that no law which restrains them from doing those acts\r\nwhich their religion compels them to do has any validity, and thirdly,\r\nthat in answer to a charge of breaking the law of the land it is\r\nsufficient to raise and prove the plea that the act which is alleged to\r\nbe an offence is one which is enjoyed by their religion.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that Gandhi and his adherents are not aware\r\nthat this claim of the Mahomedans to be judged only by the law of the\r\nKoran, is a claim which is the _fons et origo_ of all Khilafat claims of\r\nwhatever kind. It is as well to be clear about this, for not only does\r\nthe acceptance of the claim mean the death knell of the British Empire\r\nor Indo-British commonwealth, whatever name we may care to give to the\r\ngreat fraternity of nations to which we belong, but specifically as\r\nregards India it means a real denial of Swaraj. For it involves\r\nMahomedan rule and Hindu subjection or Hindu Rule and Mahomedan\r\nsubjection. Let there be no mistake about this, no camouflage. Whatever\r\nthe Hindus may mean by the Hindu Muslim entente, and I believe they mean\r\na true equality, and whatever the more enlightened Mussalmans may mean,\r\nMohamad Ali, Shaukat Ali, and those of their persuasion, mean a\r\nMussalman dominion pure and simple, though they are of course clever\r\nenough to keep the cat in the bag so long as the time for its emergence\r\nis yet unripe. They protest, it need hardly be said, that they are\r\nanimated by no _arriere pensee_, no sectarian spirit, only by the most\r\nloving goodwill towards the Hindu brethren. But there are some of us who\r\nare too experienced to be caught by this mischievous and pernicious\r\nchaff and must sound the warning to those less experienced and more\r\ngullible. Considering the high character of some of the men who follow\r\nGandhi, I can only believe that this realization came to them so late\r\nthat it was difficult for them to withdraw.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the Karachi trial, these movements at first appear\r\ninnocuous, then grow dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Khilafat associations throughout the country were intended to carry\r\non the \"non-violent non-co-operation\" campaign against Government. The\r\nprocess of evolution from ostensible non-violence at first to violence\r\nis so well described by Mr. Macpherson speaking, in the Legislative\r\nCouncil that I have quoted it (App. XVI). It applies to all\r\norganisations, but with greater force to Khilafat for reasons arising\r\nout of Islam which will be shortly explained. There is no judicial\r\ndescription of this development in Malabar, the most notorious instance.\r\nI shall content myself, therefore, with giving a summary of the judgment\r\nconvicting certain persons for a riot in Malegaon in April, 1920. So\r\nearly had lawlessness in this form begun to show itself. It will also\r\nexplain the methods adopted.\r\n\r\nA political movement began in Malegaon on the 15th March 1920, when a\r\n\"Khilafat Committee\" and a body of \"volunteers\" were formed. The\r\nCommittee's activities took the shape of lectures and \"wazas\". The\r\nlectures were political and the \"wazas\" are said to have been religious\r\nsermons. In January, 1921, Shaukat Ali visited the town and lectured on\r\nthe Khilafat movement. It was shortly after this visit that political\r\nactivity became intensified.\r\n\r\nThe two Mahomedan schools, the Beitulullum and the Anjuman school, used\r\nto receive grants-in-aid from Government. Money was raised to enable the\r\ntwo State-aided schools to refuse the Government grant-in-aid in\r\npursuance of the non-co-operation movement, and a few Hindus were\r\nmembers of the party. The collections were to be made by means of a\r\n\"paisa\" fund, an old idea. Every person selling a \"sari\", that is all\r\nthe weavers in Malegaon, were required to pay a \"paisa\" or quarter of an\r\nanna to the fund.\r\n\r\nThe system left practically no option to the weavers who objected to pay\r\nthe \"paisa\". Objecting buyers were encountered by persecution. The fund\r\nCommittee called a public meeting on the 27th February, at which it was\r\nresolved that the buyers refusing to make the collections as directed\r\nshould be commercially boycotted. The commercial boycott of the\r\nrecalcitrant buyers was enforced by picketing their shops with\r\nvolunteers and their business was stopped. The former had appealed for\r\nprotection to the authorities by applications and petitions, but so long\r\nas nothing actually illegal was done these were powerless actively to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile lectures and \"wazas\" were being continually held in the open\r\nspaces in the town and excitement was running high. On the reports made\r\nto him the District Magistrate came to the conclusion that in a place\r\nlike Malegaon which is ill-lighted the carrying of swords and cudgels at\r\npublic meetings at night by volunteers was likely to lead to a breach of\r\nthe peace. He therefore issued a proclamation on the 30th March\r\nprohibiting the practice. It was a breach of the terms of this\r\nproclamation and its enforcement by prosecutions which was the immediate\r\nexcuse for the riot.\r\n\r\nBut the local authorities had also tried to allay the friction and\r\nexcitement in other ways. The Sub-Divisional Officer, had called a\r\nmeeting on the 13th March with a view to find a method of collection of\r\nthe Fund which might put an end to the trouble about it and stop\r\nenforced contributions. Collection boxes were recommended, but nothing\r\ndefinite was agreed to by the other side.\r\n\r\nSome of the leaders were persuaded to issue a manifesto which was signed\r\nby eleven persons. This manifesto quotes Mr. Gandhi's dictates to\r\nnon-violence and exhorts the volunteers not to carry cudgels and\r\nrecommends that only peaceful methods should be used in collecting the\r\nFunds.\r\n\r\nIt clearly had little effect. One of the men who signed it, on the 4th\r\nApril (it had been issued on the 1st April) at a public meeting\r\napologized for it on his own and the other signatories' behalf and they\r\nwere pardoned for having signed it. Meanwhile the boycotting and\r\npicketing of the shops of the Anti-Fund people was continued. On the\r\n15th prosecutions were instituted against 24 volunteers for a breach of\r\nthe District Magistrate's proclamation of the 30th March. On the 24th\r\nApril, the day before the hearing of these cases, a meeting was again\r\ncalled at night at which a leading Mahomedan is reported to have used\r\nthe following words:--\r\n\r\n\"They must not be afraid of Government or of the police and that the\r\nvolunteers would see about the cases brought against them and may God\r\ngive the volunteers strength to promote their religion.\" The next day\r\nApril 25th twelve of these cases came on for hearing before Mr. Thakar\r\nthe Resident Magistrate. They ended in the conviction of the 6\r\nvolunteers and their being fined Rs. 50 each with the alternative of 4\r\nweeks' simple imprisonment. The fines were not paid.\r\n\r\nOn the result being known the mob that had collected gave vent to their\r\nfeelings by loud cries of \"Alla-ho-akbar,\" the war cry used by the mob\r\nthroughout the riot, assaulted all the police to be found in the town of\r\nMalegoan, burned a temple, killed the Sub-Inspector of Police, not the\r\nonly one killed and threw his body into the fire and looted the houses\r\nof all who were opposed to the Khilafat movement, the owners themselves\r\nhaving fled in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the 'non-violent' methods followed by the Khilafat\r\ncommittees and volunteers. I give another instance in full for\r\nillustration Barabanki (App. XI) which shows perhaps more forcibly the\r\nviolent fanaticism supporting the movement. More instances can be easily\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe development from an apparently peaceful to a revolutionary attitude\r\nis strikingly illustrated in the Khilafat agitation not only by\r\nrevolutionary activities but by open declaration. The resolution of the\r\nKarachi Conference showed the Mahomedan intention to declare\r\nindependence and proclaim an Indian Republic at the following Congress\r\nat Ahmedabad in December 1921. A resolution for absolute independence\r\nwas actually passed in the Subjects Committee of the Khilafat Conference\r\nat Ahmedabad, but was not passed at the Conference itself only because\r\nthe President ruled it out of order. But immediately after the meeting\r\nformally closed, the motion was passed by the members of the Conference\r\nat the instance of the President of Muslim League whose speech as\r\nPresident will amply repay perusal (App. XVIII). He was in effect only\r\ncarrying out at the Khilafat Conference the intention of the Karachi\r\nConference of which the Ali Brothers were the moving spirits. In his\r\nspeech he points out, what in effect is apparent to all, that Islam is\r\nopposed to non-violence and, as he said in the course of one of his\r\nspeeches, the Mussalmans accepted it on the promise of Mr. Gandhi to\r\nsecure Swaraj within a year. It was a legitimate move therefore to\r\nproclaim a rebellion. Another difference in principle was pointed out\r\nwhich is productive of frightful consequences and must alienate Hindus\r\nfrom Mahomedans. The Ali Brothers had already said that if the Afghans\r\ninvaded India to wage a holy war the Indian Mahomedans are not only\r\nbound to fight them but also to fight the Hindus if they refuse to\r\nco-operate with them. When therefore Gandhi and his followers\r\nfraternised with the Khilafatists, the latter had no doubt of their\r\nsupport if eventually it came to rebellion. They were confirmed in this\r\nby Gandhi's attitude on the questions in issue between them and the\r\nHindus. He advises the latter Hindus--to submit themselves to Mahomedan\r\ndictation. He begs them not to insist on the prohibition of the cow\r\nslaughter by Mahomedans and to rely upon Mahomedan forbearance to afford\r\nthem relief in that direction. On the other hand he advises the Hindus\r\nto refrain from irritating the Mahomedans by insisting on carrying their\r\nprocessions past the mosques on their religious occasions. He advises\r\nthem to study Hindustani as against Hindi; in fact complete submission\r\nto the Muslim feelings in all matters in controversy between them. His\r\nattitude towards the Mopla outrages shows the extent of his surrender.\r\nHis alliance with the Khilafat movement has led to frightful results in\r\nMalabar. Relying on the assurance of Gandhi and his followers, of Hindu\r\nsupport for the Khilafat movement, and supported by the teaching that\r\nthe Hindus may be treated as foes on failure to support them in a holy\r\nwar, the Moplas when they rose against the British Government were\r\nfurious at the Hindu attitude of loyalty to England. The result was,\r\nthemselves, armed and organised they took the Hindus unawares and\r\ncommitted atrocities too well known, to need recapitulation\r\nhere--butchered them and inflicted injuries on them far worse than death.\r\n\r\nFor sheer brutality on women, I do not remember anything in history to\r\nmatch the Malabar rebellion. It broke out about the 20th of August. Even\r\nby the 6th of September the results were dreadful. The Viceroy's speech\r\nmade on that date deserves careful attention (App. I).\r\n\r\nThe atrocities committed more particularly on women are so horrible and\r\nunmentionable that I do not propose to refer to them in this book. I\r\nhave selected a few accounts out of literally hundreds that might be\r\nselected from the English and vernacular papers (App. III). One\r\nnarrative is by Mrs. Besant. The resolution passed at a meeting presided\r\nover by the Zamorin Maharaja at which, many of the leading Hindus in the\r\nDistrict were present enters a strong protest against the attempts made\r\nby interested persons to minimize the gravity of the occurrence (App.\r\nV). The moving appeal signed by many ladies headed by the senior Rani\r\nof Nilambur who belongs to one of the wealthiest families and were\r\nrulers in ancient days shows the nature of the atrocities and the\r\napprehensions still entertained after the rebellion is quelled (App.\r\nIV). I do not think it advisable to publish any more but I would point\r\nout in addition to those mentioned in these articles two other forms of\r\ntorture credibly reported as having been resorted to in the case of\r\nmen--flaying alive, and making them dig their own graves before their\r\nslaughter. It is now ascertained that the Mahomedans had held frequent\r\nmeetings in their mosques and, had made all preparations for a rising.\r\nHence it was difficult for the Hindus in these tracts to make any\r\ndefence or escape. The horrid tragedy continued for months. Thousands of\r\nMahomedans killed, and wounded by troops, thousands of Hindus butchered,\r\nwomen subjected to shameful indignities, thousands forcibly converted,\r\npersons flayed alive, entire families burnt alive, women it is said\r\nhundreds throwing themselves into wells to avoid dishonour, violence and\r\nterrorism threatening death standing in the way of reversion to their\r\nown religion. This is what Malabar in particular owes to the Khilafat\r\nagitation, to Gandhi and his Hindu friends. The President of the Indian\r\nMoslem League, following the Ali injunction, justified the Mahomedan\r\natrocities as an act of war against the Hindus and the Government.\r\nGandhi too pleaded for the Mahomedans. All this was too much even for\r\ntheir dupes who have entered a spirited protest (App. III). It is\r\nimpossible after all I have said above that there can be any sympathy\r\nwith the Khilafat agitation. The future may be envisaged. Gandhi and his\r\ndupes have led Khilafatists to understand that the Hindus will stand by\r\nthem in any contingency, impliedly assuring them, as they believed in\r\nMalabar, of support even in resistance to British rule. This Islamic\r\nconsciousness which looks to a brotherhood beyond India and beyond the\r\nEmpire does not support the claim for early concession of Home Rule, for\r\nHome Rule means Home Rule within the Empire, not outside it--the Home\r\nRule enjoyed by the self-governing constituents of the commonwealth. The\r\nEmpire, it will be reasonably urged, cannot afford to place great power\r\nin the hands of a party which would subordinate the interests of the\r\nEmpire and of India to the interests of a large body outside the Empire\r\nwho actually stand in opposition to it. The introduction of this\r\nreligious element in this manner is fatal to the well-being of the\r\nEmpire, and unless some other basis can be found for the Hindu-Mahomedan\r\nentente, it must go. The extent to which Mr. Gandhi is prepared to go in\r\nsupport of the Khilafat claim is stated in this extract:--\r\n\r\n \"What will the Imperial Government do if France were to attempt to\r\n deprive England of Dover and India were secretly to help France or\r\n openly to show indifference or hostility to England's struggle to\r\n retain Dover? Can Indians be expected to sit idle when the Khilafat is\r\n vivisected?\"\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to ask the Empire or India to go to war in favour of an\r\noppressed class--but to ask her to do it in the interests of\r\nco-religionists of a community living outside the Empire is very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nWhat is the present position? I shall describe it in the words of one of\r\nMr. Gandhi's dupes, a secretary of a District Congress Committee, Mr. K.\r\nMadhavan Nair of Calicut, who writes on January 4th as follows:--\r\n\r\n Now the position is this:--\r\n\r\n The Hindus and Mohamedans have been waging a common war with\r\n non-violence as the fundamental creed. It has to be noted however, that\r\n there is a party led by the Maulana that advocates violence for the\r\n achievement of their object. Suppose to-morrow that party takes to\r\n violence and the other remains non-violent, what will be the fate of\r\n the non-violent party if Maulana's views are pushed to their logical\r\n conclusion? Is freedom worth having if in the attainment of it you have\r\n to loot, murder and outrage your innocent neighbour who does not agree\r\n with you or approve of your methods and is Swaraj possible of\r\n achievement and the Khilafat likely to be righted by such means?\r\n Maulana's views make those who have absolutely no faith in violence to\r\n think over these facts deeply and anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Non-Mahomedans, did not trouble themselves about the Khilafat\r\nclaims. Mr. Gandhi and his followers took it up as an anti-British\r\nmovement to secure Mahomedan support to his non-co-operation movement.\r\nEven that non-Mahomedan sympathy with the Khilafat movement, has\r\nvanished. That movement acquired its strength on account of such\r\nunfortunate statements that the Secretary of State and the Government of\r\nIndia are in hearty sympathy with the Moslim demands; statements like\r\nthose reported to have been made by His Highness Aga Khan that Mr.\r\nMontagu is doing as much as it is possible to support the Mahomedan\r\nclaim and Gandhi himself could not have done more. I doubt whether any\r\ninfluential newspaper or any publicist in America, England or the\r\ncontinent support the Khilafat claim as advanced by Indian Mahomedans or\r\nby Gandhi. However, the reputed sentiments of Mr. Montagu and the\r\nGovernment of India have influenced even moderate Mahomedans and Hindus\r\nto support them against the cabinet in starting and supporting an\r\nagitation, which has now assumed dangerous proportions.\r\n\r\nThe Khilafat movement does not want, and Mr. Gandhi is not for, any\r\nreasonable settlement of the Mahomedan grievance or for Home Rule. They\r\nwish to get rid of the British Government. Such being the objective\r\nnaturally the Khilafat Indian agitators have put forward demands which\r\nthe Turks themselves recognise as outside practical politics. They have\r\nhampered the efforts of their friends for a revision of the treaty of\r\nSevres. Everybody now realises that this attitude of the Khilafat\r\nmovement under the guidance of Gandhi and Mahomed Ali stood in the way\r\nof any reasonable settlement. It is a futile endeavour of the Indian and\r\nBritish Governments to satisfy Mr. Gandhi or the Khilafat agitators led\r\nby the Ali brothers. Gandhi and his followers have greatly encouraged\r\nthe growth of Indian Pan Islamism which will in future be always opposed\r\nto other Religions and civilizations. I can well understand the adherent\r\nof large numbers of Mussulmans to the idea of Pan-Islamism. It must\r\nnaturally have a fascination for devotees of Islam by reason of the\r\nsplendour of its promise that Mussulmans the world over shall one day be\r\nunited under one flag, but we have to take the world as it is and to\r\ntake into the consideration the forces actually at work in\r\nreconstruction. The world has passed the stage of religious empires. It\r\nhas gone beyond the stage of religious crusades. We are on the threshold\r\nof an era of a brotherhood transcending religious differences,\r\ntranscending even national differences and of which one of the dominant\r\nnotes is a unity of purpose in which religious differences of race and\r\ncustoms are to be merged and harmonised. Pan-Islamism or\r\nPan-Christianity or Pan-Budhism--one can hardly speak of\r\nPan-Hinduism--belong to the world that is dead and not to the world that\r\nis living. They mean destruction, proselytisation, the assertion of\r\nsuperiority the world war was waged to destroy. This also shows the\r\ndangerous foundation on which the Gandhi movement rests. Home Rule or\r\nSwaraj is claimed not as an end in itself but for the purpose of\r\nrighting the alleged wrongs sustained by foreigners. We know Gandhi's\r\nprinciples which I have set forth above. Swaraj or political\r\nindependence is not what he really wants. It is not the Caliph\r\ngrievances that have led him to claim political independence. He wants\r\nto destroy the British Government, as a hater of all Governments.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Government towards the people of the Punjab and the\r\nPunjab officials is stated in the Congress Resolution as the second and\r\nthe only other reason for this non-co-operation campaign against the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUNJAB ATROCITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one feels for the Punjab more than I do. I doubt whether anybody was\r\nin a position to know more of it than I was. Even now with all the\r\nenquiries made by the Hunter Commission and by the Congress\r\nSub-Committee many deplorable incidents as bad as any, worse perhaps,\r\nthan any reported have not been disclosed. At this distance of time it\r\nis best that they should remain so. It is with a full knowledge of this\r\nthat I make the following remarks.\r\n\r\nThe conditions now have entirely changed. Before the Reforms under a\r\nLieutenant-Governor, a single individual, the atrocities in the Punjab\r\nwhich we know only too well, could be committed almost with impunity.\r\nNow instead of one man the Government of the Punjab consist not only of\r\na Governor who no doubt is an Englishman, but of an Executive Council\r\nconsisting of an Englishman and an Indian, who was a non official before\r\nappointment to his seat in the Council and for all practical purposes\r\ntwo Indian Ministers who are also consulted in all important matters.\r\nThough, therefore, a repetition of the old incidents may be possible, it\r\nis unlikely. The Government of India again, which then consisted of only\r\none Indian, now includes three Indian members, a powerful contingent.\r\nAbove all, it will be remembered that it was necessary to pass an Act of\r\nIndemnity to save the delinquents from proceedings in civil and criminal\r\nCourts. Such an Act of Indemnity would scarcely be possible now, with a\r\nLegislative Assembly consisting of a majority of elected members under\r\nthe new constitution. The trouble in the Punjab arose out of the Rowlat\r\nAct which is repealed. Many high handed proceedings were taken under the\r\nRegulations of 1818 the provisions of which were applied for purposes\r\nfor which they were never intended. The regulations are now repealed so\r\nfar as the matters are concerned. Many of these proceedings were taken\r\nunder the Defence of India Act and they also have gone so that for the\r\nfuture at any rate our position is very different from what it was in\r\nthe past. In such circumstances what is it that one would expect? If it\r\nis an honest endeavour that is being made to solve the difficulties\r\nwhich arose out of the Punjab, one would expect a demand for any further\r\nguarantees that may be necessary against a repetition of such\r\noccurrences and the punishment of those who have acted not under an\r\nerror of judgment and not in good faith. But the demands now made are of\r\na very different kind. They do not seek for further guarantees, at least\r\nnone are formulated.\r\n\r\nI realise that the eulogium passed by the English Cabinet on Lord\r\nChemsford and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was an outrage on Indian public\r\nopinion. I believe also that the Government of India committed a great\r\npolitical blunder in not publishing their proceedings, punishing the\r\nsubordinate officials in accordance with the orders of the Cabinet. I\r\nagree further that it was an egregious mistake to pass the Indemnity Act\r\nwhen India was so excited. The Government should have waited for the\r\nresult of the proceedings in Civil or Criminal Courts, when they might\r\nhave pardoned those who acted in good faith reimbursing their expenses.\r\nBut that is not the question now. Mr. Gandhi and his party want certain\r\npersons to be punished on the strength of the report submitted by the\r\nCongress Committee who made an _ex parte_ enquiry of their own without\r\nhearing the other side. This is not right. Moreover every where it is\r\nrecognised that the security of the subject, person and property,\r\nrequires that the punishment of the guilty should be in the hands of the\r\nCourts and not within the discretion of an Executive Council. If these\r\nofficers whose punishment is called for are guilty it is the Courts that\r\nought to punish them, and I speak with knowledge when I say that no\r\nsteps open to them have yet been taken by those who carry on the\r\nagitation to vindicate justice. Is it possible, then, to maintain that\r\nthe Punjab question in any way justifies the tremendous agitation that\r\nis being carried on for the dismemberment of the Empire. Besides how is\r\nit possible for any reasonable man to say that this affords any\r\njustification for not utilizing the Legislative Councils to help the\r\nPunjab and to carry out the reforms of which the country is urgently in\r\nneed. Besides it must be remembered that some of the Punjab political\r\nleaders have failed in their duty. During the crisis they refused to\r\ncome forward to substantiate their complaints of maladministration of\r\nMartial Law, even of those matters within their personal knowledge. They\r\ndid not give a chance to the Government of India to control the\r\nGovernment of the Punjab or the administration of Martial law. _The real\r\ntruth, of course, is that the Punjab grievances are only a pretext for\r\nthis agitation, by the violent section headed by Mr. Gandhi. It is\r\nreally not the redress of the Punjab grievances or prevention of the\r\nrepetition of atrocities that is sought for, so much as the expulsion of\r\nthe British Government from India._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARAJ OR HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Resolution says that on account of the failure of Government to\r\nredress these grievances we must have 'Swaraj.' It is important to\r\nremember that long before these occurrences Mr. Gandhi had come to the\r\nconclusion that we must have Independence. It would accordingly seem\r\ndishonest on his part to say that these events led him to the demand for\r\nSwaraj or Home Rule.\r\n\r\nIn his scheme of \"Home Rule for India\" Mr. Gandhi said:--\r\n\r\n \"Now you will have seen that it is not necessary for us to have as our\r\n goal the expulsion of the English. If the English became Indianised we\r\n can accommodate them. If they wish to remain in India along with their\r\n civilisation, there is no room for them. It lies with us to bring about\r\n such a state of things.\"\r\n\r\nThen in reply to the question that it is impossible that Englishmen\r\nshould ever become Indianised, he says:--\r\n\r\n \"To say that is equivalent to saying that the English have no humanity\r\n in them. And it is really beside the point whether they become so or\r\n not. If we keep our own house in order only those who are fit to live\r\n in it will remain. Others will leave of their own accord.\"\r\n\r\nIt is something that he gives a loophole to the Englishman to remain in\r\nIndia. To the question that there may be chaos and anarchy on account of\r\nthe Hindu Mahomedan position he states:--\r\n\r\n \"I would prefer any day anarchy and chaos in India to an armed peace\r\n brought about by the bayonet between the Hindus and Musalmans.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was pointed out to him that the dissensions amongst the Hindus\r\nthemselves may cause the same result he is not dismayed. He says:--\r\n\r\n \"We are not to assume that the English have changed the nature of the\r\n Pindarries and the Bhils. It is therefore better to suffer the Pindarri\r\n peril than that some one else should protect us from it and thus render\r\n us effeminate. I should prefer to be killed by the arrow of the Bhil\r\n than to seek nominal protection.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was pointed out to him that for Home Rule at this stage we have\r\nnot got an army for our own protection he said the other day:--\r\n\r\n \"I am here to confess that we are fully able to take charge of all\r\n military dispositions in the country and that we feel able to deal with\r\n all foreign complications.\" The worst that may happen is he continued\r\n that we may be blotted out from the face of the earth for which he was\r\n prepared so long as he can breathe the free atmosphere of India.\r\n\r\nThe following report is interesting; we give it below from the \"Daily\r\nExpress.\"\r\n\r\n Q:--Are you anxious to take over the whole control of the army at once\r\n or would you make an exception of that object?\r\n\r\n A:--I think we are entirely ready to take up the whole control of the\r\n Army which means practically disbanding three fourths of it. I would\r\n keep just enough to police India.\r\n\r\n Q:--If the army were reduced to that extent, do you not apprehend\r\n anything aggressive from the frontier territories?\r\n\r\n A:--No.\r\n\r\n Q:--My information, derived from Military sources, is that there are\r\n over half-a-million armed men on the frontier.\r\n\r\n A:--You are right, I agree.\r\n\r\n Q:--These tribes have frequently attacked India hitherto. Why do you\r\n think they will refrain from doing so when India possesses Home Rule?\r\n\r\n A:--In the first instance, the world's views have changed and secondly\r\n the preparations that are now made in Afghanistan are really in support\r\n of the Khilafat. But when the Khilafat question is out of the way, then\r\n the Afghan people will not have any design on India. The warrior tribes\r\n who live on loot and plunder are given lakhs of rupees as subsidy. I\r\n would also give them a little subsidy. When the Charka comes into force\r\n in India, I would introduce the spinning wheel among the Afghan tribes\r\n also and thus prevent them from attacking the Indian territories. I\r\n feel that the tribesmen are in their own way God-fearing people.\r\n\r\nBut for the fact that he is well known to be a Saint and Mahatma, I\r\nwould have had no hesitation in saying that his last observations about\r\nmeeting the Afghans show him to be either a fool or a knave.\r\n\r\nHe said on the 16th February 1921:--\r\n\r\n \"There must be complete independence, if England's policy is in\r\n conflict with the Moslim sentiment on the Khilafat question or with the\r\n Indian sentiment in the Punjab.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his recent speech at the congress opposing the resolution for\r\nIndependence it was said that if the Punjab and Khilafat demands are\r\ncomplied with, Independence is not necessary. Well, he knows or ought to\r\nknow they are impossible demands. The implication is plain and taken in\r\nconjunction with what has been said above as to the Western civilisation\r\nand the Indianisation of the English people, the conclusion that he is\r\nreally aiming at Independence is inevitable. To certain Boy Scouts on\r\nthe 23rd March he was quite plain. He said:--\r\n\r\n \"No Indian could remain loyal in the accepted sense to the Empire as it\r\n was at present represented and be loyal to God at the same time. An\r\n Empire that could be responsible for the terrorism of the martial law\r\n regime, that would not repent of the wrong, that could enter into\r\n secret treaties in breach of solemn obligations could only be reckoned\r\n as a Godless Empire. Loyalty to such an Empire was disloyalty to God\".\r\n\r\nThese have to be borne in mind when we consider the question of the\r\nSwaraj that he has put forward. The Swaraj that he works for is thus\r\ndescribed:--\r\n\r\n \"Swaraj means full Dominion status. The scheme of such swaraj shall be\r\n framed by representatives duly elected in terms of the Congress\r\n constitution. That means four anna franchise. Every Indian adult, male\r\n or female, paying four annas and signing the Congress creed will be\r\n entitled to be placed on the electoral list. These would elect\r\n delegates who would frame Swaraj constitution. This shall be given\r\n effect to without any change by the British Parliament\".\r\n\r\nA more preposterous demand cannot be imagined. He excludes all those who\r\ndo not belong to his Congress. Those who do not pay annas four and sign\r\nthe congress creed form the majority of the population. Again to ask the\r\nBritish Parliament to accept the scheme framed by his party however\r\nabsurd, without examination of the same is absolute nonsense. If Mr.\r\nGandhi and his party can frame a scheme of Swaraj for the consideration\r\nof the rest of India, have it discussed with others modified if\r\nnecessary after such discussion, it may be, and it ought to be placed\r\nbefore the Government and Parliament. But this is the last thing he will\r\ndo, for various reasons. Mr. Gandhi himself will never do it because I\r\ndoubt whether he has any correct idea of the Dominion status and all\r\nthat it involves. Mr. Gandhi is not a student but an impulsive fanatic\r\nindifferent to facts but obsessed by phantasmagoria. He jumps to what he\r\ncalls conclusions but which have in fact no premises. Again he will not\r\nsee it done because what he really desires is not an honest settlement\r\nwhich will give India a further instalment of Swaraj but as the\r\npreceding extracts show what he wants is really absolute independence\r\naccording to his professions but really anarchy or soul force. If he\r\nwere honest in his desire to secure Swaraj he and his followers would\r\nnot have boycotted the Councils but would have entered them to take\r\nfurther steps towards its attainment.\r\n\r\nI am therefore satisfied that Mr. Gandhi does not aim at a fair\r\nsettlement of the Punjab difficulties. He does not want an equitable\r\npeace satisfying the just claims of the Mahomedans. He does not want\r\nParliamentary Swaraj or Home Rule. But for tactical purposes he is\r\nputting them forward to destroy the English Government, in order to\r\nattain his object of a society outlined in his \"Indian Home Rule,\" some\r\nfeatures of it I have set forth above.--A society without Government,\r\nRailways, Hospitals, Schools, Courts, etc. His programme is therefore\r\nput forward to clear the way to obtain his object. This Swaraj is to be\r\nattained by, in the words of the Resolution, non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation with Government. And among others the following steps\r\nwere recommended for adoption: (1) Boycott of Government aided schools\r\nand colleges and establishment of National schools and colleges, (2)\r\nBoycott of British Courts by Lawyers and Litigants (3) Boycott of\r\nReformed Councils (4) Boycott of Foreign goods and use of spinning\r\nwheels. Out of these I shall naturally take up the question of the\r\nboycott of Government and aided institutions and the nature of education\r\nsought to be imparted by Mr. Gandhi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of Education which Mr. Gandhi apparently wants to introduce\r\nhas already been tried in some parts of India. The results of a teaching\r\nconfined to Eastern classics and vernaculars has already been apparent.\r\nIt has produced a mentality amongst Hindus and Mahomedans which has\r\ndivided them from one another. It has separated still further the\r\nBrahmins from non-Brahmins, the caste Hindus from the noncaste Hindus.\r\nIt has again produced amongst those who have received that education a\r\nvague longing for speculative theories and a distaste for experiment and\r\nresearch by which, theories may be tested. Of course Mr. Gandhi does not\r\nknow these results. His speeches and writings do not show that he ever\r\ncared to enquire into these questions. He does not want education to be\r\nimparted to the masses and Western education to be imparted to anybody\r\nfor the reason that it would make them discontented with their present\r\nlot in life, _i.e._ in other words he wants each class to remain in its\r\npresent condition, the lower castes, slaves of their masters--the higher\r\nclasses. This consequence follows from his acceptance of the caste\r\nsystem. He says \"Varanashram (caste system) is inherent in human nature\r\nand Hinduism has simply reduced it to a science. It does attach by\r\nbirth. A man cannot change his Varna by choice. Prohibition against\r\nintermarriage and interdining is essential for a rapid evolution of the\r\nsoul.\" He would relegate those Hindus outside the pale of caste, the\r\npanchamas or the so-called degraded classes, by whatever name they are\r\ncalled, to degradation for the service of the higher castes. His\r\nwritings or speeches do not show any knowledge of Indian History and\r\nhaving spent the main portion of his life in a far-off country the evils\r\nof the system perhaps never came to his knowledge. Otherwise he would\r\nhave learnt the following facts. It is this caste system which has\r\nbrought about the conquest of India by the Mahomedans and the\r\nEnglishmen, both of whom were always supported by the lower castes\r\nagainst the higher. It is responsible for the large conversions to\r\nChristianity and Mahomedanism. It is responsible for a degradation of\r\nhumanity for which no parallel can be found in slavery, ancient or\r\nmodern. It is responsible for a good deal of Hindu-Mahomedan, Brahmin\r\nnon-Brahmin problem and stands in the way of our social, economical and\r\npolitical progress. Yet Mr. Gandhi supports the system, though he\r\nadvocates the removal of one or two blots which hardly affect the main\r\nstructure. He enters on an elaborate disquisition on the benefits and\r\nnecessity of caste which will not do credit to Macaulay's fourth form\r\nschoolboy. He shows no knowledge of the vast literature on the subject\r\nor of the main arguments against it. He is supporting the caste system\r\nto secure the support of the higher castes, without whose financial\r\nsupport his agitation must collapse. One of his own followers would have\r\ntold him that caste has killed all the arts and science in this country.\r\nSir P. C. Ray points out in his history of Hindu chemistry:--\"the fear\r\nof losing caste was thus responsible for the loss of the faculty of\r\nindependent enquiry and hence for the decline and decay of all the arts\r\nand sciences for which India was once so famous.\" Of course he does not\r\nwant that education which is indispensable for those who occupy the\r\nhigher Government offices in the country. He does not want that\r\neducation which is essential for the development of Indian manufacturing\r\nindustries and development of mineral resources.\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi accordingly made his wicked attempt to destroy the National\r\nHindu University of Benares and the Mahomedan University of Aligarh.\r\nThey combined Eastern and Western learning. The attempt was happily\r\nunsuccessful. Strong pressure was put upon the students to leave the\r\nSchools and Colleges. Looking to the final results as disclosed in the\r\nReport of the Congress Secretary reviewing the work of 1921, Government\r\nhave reasons to congratulate themselves. By far the majority of the\r\naided institutions in Bengal have been recognised by the Educational\r\nAuthorities to be very inefficient and they have been attempting either\r\nto disaffiliate them or reduce their numbers to give more efficient\r\ninstruction to those who remain, as a good number of them were\r\ninstitutions started for commercial purpose. It is remarkable that the\r\ngreat majority of the students who obeyed the Congress cause belonged to\r\nthese aided institutions. Those who left the Government Schools and\r\nColleges with better discipline and more efficient teaching were very\r\nfew if any. I would refer the reader for further information as to the\r\nresults of the education campaign to the speech of the President of the\r\nThana conference, a genuine patriot who happens, however, to be one of\r\nGandhi's followers (App. VI).\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi asked all the boys to withdraw now from the schools on the\r\npretence that until the Government punishes the Punjab offenders in the\r\nmanner advocated by him and satisfies the claims of the Khilafatists we\r\nshould no longer associate with the Government, and we can there-by\r\nhasten the advent of Swaraj. This is a mere pretext. He advocated the\r\nsubstitution of the national kind of education as outlined by him in\r\nfavour of the present system of education long before there was any\r\nPunjab or Khilafat questions. He advocated them in 1908 in his book \"The\r\nIndian Home Rule.\" To say now that he advocated them on account of those\r\nreasons is sheer hypocrisy. The step will not hasten but might retard\r\nSwaraj. Even if the Punjab wrongs are redressed in the manner suggested\r\nand even if the Khilafatists are satisfied and Parliamentary Swaraj\r\nobtained, he will still be an advocate of the abstention from English\r\nSchools in favour of the system of national education as above set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVAKILS AND COURTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same is the case about his propaganda about the Vakils and the\r\nCourts. It never had any chance of success. I shall not dwell however\r\nupon this but would refer to Thana President's speech to which in\r\nconnection with education attention has been already drawn (App. VI). He\r\nnow puts them forth ostensibly for the purpose of compelling the\r\nGovernment to redress the Punjab and other wrongs. As a fact he\r\nadvocated them long before that in 1908, as I have already pointed out\r\nabove. Here again it is sheer hypocrisy to say that they are advocated\r\nnot as an end in themselves but as a means for the redress of the Punjab\r\nand Khilafat wrongs. He dare not openly advocate this as desirable in\r\nitself as he would then be laughed at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYCOTT OF COUNCILS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other step that he advocates is abstention from the new councils.\r\nHis followers generally have not voted at the elections or have stood\r\nfor election. His reason given at the Calcutta Congress in September\r\n1920 when he moved his resolution on non-co-operation is this. \"I now\r\ncome to the burning topic _viz._ the boycott of the councils. Sharpest\r\ndifference of opinion existed regarding this and if the house was to\r\ndivide on it, it must divide on one _viz._ whether Swaraj has to be\r\ngained through the councils or without the councils. If we utterly\r\ndistrust the British Government and we know that they are to-day\r\nunrepentant now can you believe that the councils will lead to Swaraj\r\nand not tighten the British hold on India\"? I can only ask him to read\r\nthe history of the Parliamentary struggle for freedom in England which\r\nwill show how freedom is won from reluctant monarchs and privileged\r\nclasses. Even in India the subsequent history of the Legislative\r\ncouncils has shown that the Government is willing to meet the councils\r\nhalf way and almost every question taken up by the councils has been\r\nadvanced nearer solution. But I doubt whether there is any use of\r\narguing with Mr. Gandhi. The real truth is as he has candidly avowed in\r\nhis \"Indian Home Rule\" that Parliamentary Government is in itself bad\r\nand India should not strive after it as it will stand in the way of his\r\nspiritual Swaraj. I need not argue this point so far as the followers of\r\nGandhi are concerned as they are heartily sorry that they boycotted the\r\ncouncils. I refer on this point also to the Thana Conference President's\r\nspeech (App. VII). They feel ashamed of themselves the majority of them\r\ndesire the dissolution of the present councils and a re-election so that\r\nthey might utilize these councils for more powerful Parliaments. Perhaps\r\nI should add that considering the undisciplined fanaticism of the\r\nnon-co-operator and his total ignorance of development of political\r\norganization, it is probably just as well that the councils were in\r\ntheir inception preserved from such a calamitous invasion. The council\r\nand the assembly have even in the short duration of their existence,\r\nachieved good results which are carrying us far and quietly on that true\r\nroad to Home Rule from which Mr. Gandhi seeks to divert us. Had the\r\nNon-Co-operators been members of these councils and had they acted in\r\ntheir present temper, they might well have wrecked the Reforms and have\r\nset back the clock of India's progress even more than they have done\r\nalready. The boycotting is therefore in all probability a blessing\r\nthough designed as a curse. Still the fact remains that the Councils\r\nmight have done even more had Mr. Gandhi been endowed with the wisdom to\r\nsee that India's interests would best be served by using the councils\r\nand the assembly as levers to obtain further freedom on sane, safe, and\r\nconstitutional lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYCOTT OF FOREIGN GOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not only no objection to the Charka but it is very much to be\r\ncommended. It is very useful as a cottage or home industry and will find\r\nan occupation to many who might otherwise be idle. But it will not\r\ndisplace foreign goods at least without the aid of mills by foreign\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nAll these with other minor ones are only steps to be taken to carry out\r\nthe policy of non-violent non-co-operation for the attainment of Swaraj\r\nand Mr. Gandhi asks every body, in fact the people of India, to carry on\r\nnon-violent non-co-operation with the Government so as ostensibly to\r\nattain Swaraj but really I have no doubt as an end in itself.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that non-violent submission to suffering and\r\nthe consequent attainment of self-control over oneself which he called\r\nSwaraj was the end which he had in view. He found that there was no use\r\nin directly advocating it. He therefore puts it forward as the chief\r\ninstrument for obtaining the Parliamentary Swaraj which the people of\r\nIndia wanted. He based his appeal to the Hindus on the well known\r\ndoctrine of \"Ahimsa\". I will not stop here to discuss how far suffering\r\nfor the purpose of inducing another to follow a particular line of\r\nconduct is included in the scope of Ahimsa. I myself believe it is not\r\nonly not so included but is totally inconsistent with it. I will merely\r\npoint out that this principle has already been condemned by the Penal\r\nCode which makes it a crime for a creditor to realise his debt by\r\nDharna. For my purpose it is only necessary to say that this principle\r\nof non-violence if accepted in practice generally will lead to chaos and\r\nanarchy. If applied to Government alone by refusal to recognise the\r\njurisdiction of the courts it will lead to the same results. How it will\r\nlead to 'Parliamentary Swaraj' it is impossible to see. Mr. Gandhi says\r\nif all the people of India adopted it the machinery of Government is\r\nbound to come to a standstill. But that all will adopt it without\r\nleaving sufficient men with the aid of those who will be imported from\r\nEngland and elsewhere to carry out the administration is only the\r\nfantasy of a diseased imagination. Non-violence is a guarantee on the\r\npart of those who carry it out that the Government has nothing to fear\r\nfrom physical force. If they use force then they abandon the weapon of\r\nnon-violence. Mr. Gandhi and his followers, are agreed that physical\r\nforce is now out of the question on ground, according to Mr. Gandhi,\r\nthat we will be crushed. I cannot help thinking that when we take this\r\naspect of the matter along with others already mentioned that Mr. Gandhi\r\nhimself does not consider this as any effective step towards the\r\nattainment of the 'Parliamentary Swaraj,' but only to attain his\r\n\"Spiritual Swaraj.\" This explains what he is so fond of reiterating that\r\nwhen Lajpatrai, Motilal Nehru, and C. R. Das and others were arrested\r\nand went to Jail without complaint, or resistance denying the\r\njurisdiction of the courts, in pursuance of the policy of non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation, though Parliamentary Swaraj was not attained, the\r\nspiritual 'Swaraj' of which he was in search has been attained to his\r\nintense satisfaction. If he had advocated abstention from schools,\r\nboycott of Councils and Courts, non-violence as a means of attaining his\r\n(spiritual) Swaraj, giving up Punjab Khilafat and Parliamentary Home\r\nRule, no one would perhaps have any right to complain, and it would have\r\nbeen a straightforward and honest course. But he has adopted underhand\r\nmethods which appear to me, unless a satisfactory explanation is given,\r\nlittle short of dishonest and fraudulent.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked whether anybody would have accepted a policy of\r\nnon-violent non-co-operation in the circumstances of the case unless\r\nthere was some reasonable prospect of success within any measurable\r\ntime. Here we come to the most sinister aspect of the matter. In moving\r\nhis resolution on non-co-operation in the National Congress held at\r\nCalcutta in September 1920, he said, \"If there is sufficient response to\r\nmy scheme I make bold to reiterate my statement that you can gain\r\nSwarajya in the course of an year\" and he laid down certain conditions,\r\nthe more important of which have been mentioned. That period has been\r\nextended subsequently by a few months. Even that extended period has\r\nelapsed. When charged with his failure to attain Parliamentary Swaraj\r\nwithin the period asked for by him he had effrontery to state that the\r\nconditions mentioned by him have not been complied with. A political\r\nleader has no right to put forward before the country any scheme under\r\nconditions which he has no reasonable belief of being likely to be\r\ncomplied with. Did he honestly believe that those conditions named by\r\nhim would be complied with and Parliamentary Swaraj obtained within the\r\ntime mentioned by him? Looking to the nature of the conditions I do not\r\nthink he believed that they would be complied with, not only in one year\r\nbut at any time; and even if complied with I have no doubt he did not\r\nbelieve that Swaraj would come though he might assert the contrary. He\r\nput the lure forward simply for the purpose of persuading the Congress\r\nto make an important change in the policy which the country had hitherto\r\nadopted. The National Congress, carried away by its hostility towards\r\nGovernment, accepted his programme. Some of the younger men may have\r\nbelieved in it. The older and the most experienced I have no doubt never\r\nbelieved in its possibility but considered it a means, of rousing the\r\npeople of the country from their political lethargy, to put pressure on\r\nthe Government for further and more extensive reforms. They may also\r\nhave felt that this might be a means of Mahomedan co-operation for their\r\npolicy. I do not deny that according to English political life this is a\r\nperfectly legitimate manoeuvre though none of those leaders believed in\r\nthe soundness of the policy put forward by Mr. Gandhi and many of them\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\nHaving attained his purpose by a representation, the truth of which I\r\ncannot help thinking he did not believe, and could not have believed,\r\nand having committed the Congress to a certain course of action, he is\r\nnow able to carry the Congress with him for revolutionary action, as it\r\nfinds it has gone too far on this course to revert to its own natural\r\nmethods of progress. But as a matter of fact he went further than this.\r\n\r\nOn 29th December, 1920, _i.e._ three months after the change of\r\nprogramme, he said, \"my experience during the last months fills me with\r\nthe hope that within the nine months that remain of the year in which I\r\nhave expected Swaraj for India we shall redress the two wrongs and we\r\nshall see Swaraj (Parliamentary) established in accordance with the\r\nwishes of the people of India.\" But I do not think for a moment he\r\nbelieved what he said. He used these words to dupe the people of India\r\nto follow him yet a step further and to pay him money. After about a\r\nmonth on the 21st of January 1921--he again confirmed his previous\r\nstatement. He said: \"Four months of this one year have already gone by\r\nand my faith has never burnt as brightly as it burns tonight as I am\r\ntalking to the young men of Bengal.\" And he added \"that in case of his\r\ndeath before the expiry of eight months he is satisfied that the people\r\nof India will secure Swaraj before the year is out.\" Is this not a\r\ndefinite statement that the Indian people are going to get Swaraj? A few\r\ndays later the purpose comes out. In a public address to the merchants\r\nof Calcutta on the 30th January, 1921, he said:--\r\n\r\n \"What I purposed to do I can accomplish in a certain line. I Must\r\n attain Swaraj. If thirty crores of people say that they are not with me\r\n yet I shall do my work and win Swaraj.... If you wish to accomplish\r\n work of thirty crores of men then come out with your money. Try to have\r\n money and ask me to give an account of the same. I appoint some one\r\n treasurer.... If you know that you yourself can not attain Swaraj +then\r\n help one with money+. If you do not help with money Swaraj will be\r\n difficult but not impossible to attain. If the students of India do not\r\n help, me it does not matter. If the pleaders do not help, it does not\r\n matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe old conditions of the boycott of schools and of the courts as\r\nconditions indispensable for the attainment of Swaraj are dropped. And\r\nhe promises Swaraj and asks for money for getting it in nine months. He\r\ncollected money on the faith of that representation. Earlier on the same\r\nday he got ten thousand rupees, and on the spot a large sum is said to\r\nhave been collected. On the same date in addressing the students he\r\nsaid: \"If the response continues as it has begun there is no doubt of\r\nSwaraj coming within the time prescribed\". On the 23rd February 1921 he\r\nagain said: \"Last five months experience has confirmed me in the\r\nopinion. I am convinced that the country has never been so ready for\r\nestablishing Swaraj as now.\" To me only one conclusion is possible that\r\nhe was collecting the money from the people who understood him to say\r\nthat Swaraj will be attained within the period mentioned by him. In\r\nMarch he said:--\r\n\r\n \"The last Congress has given a constitution whose working in itself\r\n calculated to lead to Swaraj. It is intended to secure in every part of\r\n India representative committees working in conjunction with, and under\r\n willing and voluntary submission to a central organisation--The all\r\n India Congress Committee. It establishes an adult suffrage open to men\r\n and women subject only to two qualifications signing of the creed and a\r\n nominal payment of four annas. It is intended to secure due\r\n representation of the parties and communities, if then, it is honestly\r\n worked, and commands confidence and respect, it can oust the present\r\n Government without the slightest difficulty. For, the latter has no\r\n power except through the co-operation willing or forced, of the people.\r\n The force it exercises is almost through our own people. One lac of\r\n Europeans, without our help, can only hold less than one seventh of our\r\n villages each and it would be difficult for a man even when physically\r\n present, to impose his will on, say four hundred men and women--the\r\n average population of Indian village.\"\r\n\r\nHe said that we have therefore to concentrate our attention up to the\r\n30th of June on getting:--\r\n\r\n(1) One crore of rupees for Tilak Swaraj Fund.\r\n\r\n(2) One crore members on the Congress register.\r\n\r\n(3) The spinning wheel introduced in twenty lacs of homes.\r\n\r\nHe added, however:--\r\n\r\n \"This programme does not mean cessation of the other activities of\r\n Non-co-operation. They go on. Drink and untouchability must vanish. The\r\n education movement is steadily going forward. The National institutions\r\n that have sprung up will, if they are efficiently managed make headway\r\n and attract students who are still hesitating. The pleaders, always a\r\n cautious and calculating class by training, will, as they see the\r\n movement progressing more and more, fall in line with the rest of the\r\n country. Boycott of law courts by the public is making fair progress.\r\n These things do not now require concentration of universal effort. They\r\n apply to special classes. But the three things mentioned by me are the\r\n most essential: they must be done now and without them the movement, as\r\n a mass movement must be pronounced a failure.\" _\"Young India\" 30th\r\n March._\r\n\r\nAfter this it is impossible to rely upon boycott of schools &c. as\r\nconditions for Swaraj within a year. It is now admitted and the\r\nSecretaries report that the money demanded has been collected. Such\r\nmoney was paid on the fraudulent representation of Swaraj within the\r\nyear. Judged by ordinary standards Mr. Gandhi's whole procedure with the\r\npromises, the persuasions, the evasions, the subterfuges and all the\r\nother manoeuvres, would be characterised by men of the world and of sane\r\njudgment in language, I hesitate to reproduce, for the simple reason\r\nthat I believe that Mr. Gandhi is honest in his self hypnotisation. I\r\nbelieve he does not really know what he is doing. At least this is the\r\nonly possible charitable assumption when we watch his feats of political\r\nacrobatics which have the power of deluding such vast numbers of people\r\nmaking them passionately intolerant, violently intolerant often, of the\r\nslightest criticism of their hero.\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress was asked in September to change its policy, Mr.\r\nGandhi's idea to start an organisation to supercede the existing\r\nGovernment was not brought before them. It is the first direct step in\r\nthe path of revolution. His followers have been by this time brought to\r\na proper frame of mind. The use of the money to be collected was, as\r\nstated on the 13th April, to be as follows; \"The only activity involving\r\nfinancial obligations is that of spinning, organising national service,\r\nin some cases supporting lawyers, who might have suspended practice and\r\ncannot be included in the national service as for supporting national\r\neducational institutions.\" It will now be understood why some lawyers\r\nwere willing to suspend practice. Before the expiry of one year period\r\nhowever other conditions were imposed which would put off Swaraj\r\npractically for a very long time to come, the removal of untouchability\r\nof the lower classes in India without which it was said Swaraj would be\r\na meaningless term. This means, as I have no doubt, Mr. Gandhi knew, he\r\nwas putting off Swaraj indefinitely. If this had been mentioned as\r\ncondition when the Congress was asked to change its policy it is very\r\ndoubtful whether he would have got the Congress to agree with him. As to\r\nthese two conditions themselves they are admirable. With a little tact\r\nthe Government might turn the tables on Mr. Gandhi. If proof of\r\nuntouchability consists only in the admission of the boys of these\r\nclasses to schools of higher classes, it does not mean much, though it\r\nis a notable advance. If a contact with a low class person is placed on\r\nthe same footing as contact with caste man it may be said that we have\r\ngot rid of untouchability. But this will not come throughout the greater\r\nportion of India for years. On these questions the education of Mr.\r\nGandhi has only commenced. He will find that without abrogating the\r\nceremonial law on which the caste system rests there will be no\r\npractical reform. He is apparently not aware of the far more heinous\r\ncustom of distance pollution, _i.e._ not only pollution by touch but by\r\napproach within a certain distance. This far from being a move against\r\nGovernment would support the Government contention against reform.\r\n\r\nAbout temperance also the move is salutary. If the system of picketing\r\nadopted by the volunteers is abandoned and peaceful persuasion alone is\r\nattempted no one has any right to complain. What all this has to do with\r\nParliamentary Swaraj or Home Rule one finds it difficult to understand.\r\nBut they are necessary for the 'Gandhi Swaraj' advocated in his 'Indian\r\nHome Rule', and I have little doubt that like his other proposals they\r\nwere intended to attain that object.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted in the Report of the Secretaries that the crore of Rupees\r\nwhich was required to be collected, as stated above, has been realised.\r\nAbout the middle of July he said he still looked forward before the next\r\nmeeting of the Congress for the satisfaction of his demands about the\r\nPunjab and the Khilafat and full immediate Swaraj in accordance with the\r\nwishes of her chosen representatives. August and September were devoted\r\nto the campaign of burning foreign cloth which in his view was an act of\r\nnon-violent non-co-operation with the Government. This step appeared\r\nunintelligible and inaccurate to his followers who believed bona fide\r\nthat he was striving for political control. But it is quite consistent\r\nwith and in pursuance of his scheme of spiritual swaraj of sacrifice and\r\nself-control. On the 27th of October Mr. Gandhi speaks of his \"threat to\r\nseek the shelter of the Himalayas should violence become universal in\r\nIndia, and should it not have engulfed me.\"\r\n\r\n As _New India_ points out: \"that would be interesting to know when this\r\n threat was made. We all know that Mr. Gandhi said that if there was\r\n violence he would go to the Himalayas. There was a riot, but he did not\r\n go, but excused himself by saying that if it occurred a second time, he\r\n would go. A second riot occurred; he said nothing but did not go. Now\r\n we hear that he had made a threat to go, should it become universal in\r\n India. When and where was this said?\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month the _Times of India_ observed:--\r\n\r\n \"Writing in the latest issue of Navajivan, his Gujarati newspaper, Mr.\r\n Gandhi makes the interesting announcement that if Swaraj is not\r\n obtained by December, he will either die of a broken heart or retire\r\n from public life, leaving the heedless people of India to their\r\n resources. Were so clear a pronouncement by any other politician, we\r\n could say definitely that when the new year dawns Mr. Gandhi will no\r\n longer be actively engaged in politics!\"\r\n\r\nCan there be any possible doubt that all these statements were made by\r\nhim in order to impress upon his dupes the fact that they were going to\r\nget Swaraj within a year and to deceive his followers to follow him and\r\nfinance him. Yet what was the situation! Almost every item in his\r\nprogramme has been tried and found useless to attain Home Rule. I would\r\nagain draw attention to the speech of the President of the Thana\r\nDistrict conference for a review of the situation as it then stood in\r\nthe opinion of one of his prominent followers, (App. VI). This is the\r\nopinion of most of his prominent supporters who have been opposing Mr.\r\nGandhi's programme from the very beginning and accordingly the programme\r\nwas practically shelved and at the Congress held at the end of the year\r\nit was resolved to suspend all the activities of the Congress on which\r\nstress was much laid. The programme of the volunteer organisation\r\nthroughout the country was to be carried out on a more extensive scale\r\nand the laws of the country were to be defied by disobeying the\r\nnotifications issued by Government. The Congress also recommended civil\r\ndisobedience as the only civilised and effective substitute for an armed\r\nrebellion and recommended individual disobedience as well as mass civil\r\ndisobedience when the mass of the people have been sufficiently trained\r\nin the practice of non-violence. And the activities of the Congress were\r\nto be suspended for that purpose (App. XX). \"Offensive civil\r\ndisobedience herein recommended is thus defined. _Offensive civil\r\ndisobedience means deliberate and wilful breach of State made non-moral\r\nlaws--that is, laws the breach of which does not involve moral\r\nturpitude--not for the purpose of securing the repeal of, or relief from\r\nhardships arising from obedience to such laws, but for the purpose of\r\ndiminishing the authority of, or overthrowing, the State.\"_\r\n\r\nWhat took place at the Congress itself was remarkable. The President of\r\nthe Moslem League, Moulana Hajrat Mohini, who was also a member of the\r\nNational Congress, proposed his resolution for complete independence. He\r\nis reported to have said that although last year they have been promised\r\nSwaraj, the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs within a year,\r\nthey had so far achieved nothing (App. XVIII for his view). Mr. Gandhi\r\ndenied that there was any limitation of one year when the creed was\r\naccepted in Nagpur and Calcutta. The special representative of the\r\nCongress organ, the _Bombay Chronicle_ says: \"The feeling in general\r\nappear to be in favour of Moulana Hajrat Mohini's resolution\" though it\r\nwas not carried on account of the passionate appeal of Mahatma Gandhi\r\nagainst it. It is instructive to read the resolutions (Appendix XX) that\r\nwere then passed. Thus Swaraj was to come on September 1-1921, October\r\n31-1921, December 13-1921. At the Congress in December, 1921, Mr. Gandhi\r\ngave up fixing any date for the attainment of Swaraj.\r\n\r\nThe resolution passed in September, 1920, was seditious. The resolution\r\npassed in December, 1921, is openly revolutionary, and in fact Gandhi\r\nmade no secret of it. He says: \"Lord Reading must clearly understand\r\nthat the non-co-operators are at war with the Government. They have\r\ndeclared rebellion against it in as much as it has committed a breach of\r\nfaith with the Mussalmans. It has humiliated the Punjab and insists upon\r\nimposing its will upon the people and refuses to repair the breach and\r\nrepent for the wrong done in the Punjab\" (_Young India_). Mr. Gandhi\r\nalso said: \"The Government want to goad us into violence or abject\r\nsurrender. We must do neither. We must retort by such civil disobedience\r\nas would compel shooting.\" The volunteer organizations were pledged to\r\nact accordingly. Yet when the Government notified those illegal\r\nassociations and punished those who defied them, the rebels indignantly\r\nremonstrate against what they call coercion and interference with the\r\nliberty of person and security of property. They want to be in the\r\nlimelight to evoke the admiration of America and Europe for their\r\npatriotism in rebelling against a Satanic Government. But they are\r\nwanting in the redeeming features of these rebels elsewhere--their\r\ncontempt of danger and death. That is left here to the ignorant\r\nmasses--the dupes of these men who seek to protect themselves from\r\ndanger by their doctrine of non-violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-VIOLENT NON-CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nHow on earth is it possible to imagine that all activities would be\r\nnon-violent when those who are carrying them on proclaim themselves\r\nrebels against constitutional authority and are bent upon destroying it;\r\nwhen they say that they must commit civil disobedience of a character\r\nthat would compel the officials to shoot them! when we know that one\r\nlarge section of it, the Mahomedans, follow a militant religion which\r\nnot only sanctions but requires them to use force to vindicate what they\r\nconsider to be their religious law. When we consider further the nature\r\nof the activities of those who carry on the Non-co-operation movement\r\nthere can be still less room to doubt that riots ending in bloodshed are\r\nbound to follow. In order to carry out the Non-co-operation campaign\r\nIndia is divided into various Congress provinces. Congress committees\r\nare formed consisting of members who are also pledged to carry out the\r\nCongress principles: there are also volunteer organizations formed. The\r\nfunction of these bodies is to impress upon the people of the country\r\nthe enormity of Government's crime with reference to the Punjab and the\r\nKhilafat and the consequent necessity of Home Rule or Swaraj. For\r\nattaining such Swaraj they advocate progressive non-co-operation by\r\n\"peaceful\" methods. Such methods consist of various steps which are\r\ndescribed in the speech of Mr. Macpherson, extracted below. Starting,\r\nperhaps, peacefully they soon exhibit a tendency to violence and when\r\nMahomedan sentiments are involved, when appeals are made to Mahomedan\r\nreligious feelings, that tendency becomes almost irresistible in their\r\ncase. Opposition to constituted authority inflames them into violence\r\nand instead of submitting to violence at the hands of authorities\r\naccording to the dictates of Gandhi--a counsel of perfection--they\r\nretort--and murder is the result. The process is so well put by Mr.\r\nMacpherson in the Behar Legislative Council that I take the liberty of\r\nquoting the following extract from his speech:--\r\n\r\n \"It is necessary to consider what is the essence of the\r\n non-co-operation movement, what are its ultimate objects and what are\r\n its methods. From the moment Mr. Gandhi first unfolded his plan of\r\n campaign--that was, I think, at a Benares or Allahabad Conference in\r\n 1920--there has never been any doubt in my mind that the objects of the\r\n movement were entirely unconstitutional, that its methods were illegal\r\n and that its prosecution to the bitter end is bound to result in\r\n violence, disorder and anarchy, however much non-violence may be\r\n proclaimed as the watchword of its leaders. The movement cannot be\r\n judged by its earlier and comparatively innocuous stages, as if these\r\n stood by themselves. I refer to the resignation of titles, the boycott\r\n of Government schools and colleges, the abandonment of their profession\r\n by legal practitioners and other such manifestations of\r\n non-co-operation, although all these items in the programme have done\r\n an infinite amount of harm, especially to the youth of the country, and\r\n even these earlier stages have been marked by repeated outbursts of\r\n violence, by a concerted system of intimidation and social boycott, and\r\n by the excitement of racial hatred which has had deplorable results in\r\n individual cases. No, the plan of campaign must be taken as a whole,\r\n and judged by its closing stages, the enforcement of civil disobedience\r\n towards the laws of the country, interference with the police and the\r\n judicial administration, the invasion of police stations, picketing of\r\n Courts, the seduction of the troops from their allegiance, and the\r\n refusal to pay taxes or rent or revenue. The movement must indeed be\r\n judged by its ultimate object, which is the paralysis and subversion of\r\n the existing Government and by its inevitable result, general disorder\r\n and bloodshed and widespread misery amongst all classes and\r\n communities. If pursued to the bitter end, it will assuredly have this\r\n result, whether it succeeds or fails, and should it (which God forbid)\r\n succeed, the end can only be a state of chaos which will make India the\r\n prey of the violent tribes that dwell around her borders or the hungry\r\n hordes of Central Asia who, in the course of history, have more than\r\n once invaded India. _The object of the movement being what it is, the\r\n overthrow of the existing Government in India, what is the use of\r\n telling us that either its leaders or its followers have signed a\r\n pledge of non-violence? The pledge is a farce, it has already been\r\n broken a hundred times over, and the longer the movement continues and\r\n the further it advances, the more it will be broken._\"\r\n\r\nThat this has been the case is illustrated by almost all the riots which\r\nhave taken place. Malabar stands first in its unenviable notoriety.\r\nThere the Congress committees were formed; the Khilafat committees also\r\nwere formed; Gandhi and Shaukat Ali visited Malabar, preached their\r\nsermons and the usual result followed. With Mahomedans Swaraj was only\r\ntheir secondary aim, their principal object being the redress of the\r\nKhalif's wrongs and the establishment of a Khilafat kingdom in the\r\ncountry. When, therefore, the British Government interfered with the\r\nactivities of some of the Khilafat leaders the Mohomedan population as a\r\nwhole rose in rebellion and invited the Hindus to join them. The Hindus\r\nas a body remained loyal; and the results were disastrous both to the\r\nMahomedans and to the Hindus, more than two thousand Mahomedans killed\r\nby troops according to official estimates, thousands more in other ways;\r\nfar larger numbers wounded; the number of Hindus butchered in\r\ncircumstances of barbarity, flayed alive, made to dig their own graves\r\nbefore slaughter, running into thousands; women and purdah women too,\r\nraped, not in a fit of passion but systematically for months passed from\r\nhand to hand and with calculated revolting and horrible cruelty for\r\nwhich I have not been able to find a parallel in history. Thousands were\r\nforcibly converted. All this done in the name of, and to enforce, the\r\nKhilafat movement: all this due directly to the visit of Gandhi and\r\nShaukat Ali and to the organization of Khilafat associations. They\r\ncarried on their activities openly without any obstruction by the\r\nauthorities; the Government of Madras was prevented from interfering\r\nwith Khilafat agitators by the Government of India who are therefore as\r\nresponsible as if they had directly ordered all this frightfulness.\r\n\r\nI take the United Provinces next and will refer not only to the\r\nactivities of the volunteers but to the entire situation as it developed\r\nitself from the commencement of the year 1921. That will also show the\r\nearnest efforts which were made by the Government to co-operate with the\r\nconstitutional party to work the Reform Scheme in a sympathetic spirit.\r\n\r\nIn welcoming the Legislative Council on the 22nd of January, 1921, Sir\r\nHarcourt Butler drew attention to the great efforts which were being\r\nmade by Mr. Gandhi's party to achieve their objects, to their aim, to\r\ntheir failure till that time to achieve any appreciable success (App.\r\nVII). By March the situation had become worse and he narrated the\r\ncircumstances which compelled him to extend the Seditious Meetings Act\r\nto some of the districts (App. VIII). By the end of the year the\r\nsituation became intolerable. Sir Harcourt Butler has described the\r\nefforts of the Non-co-operators, and the success they have achieved, in\r\nhis speech on the 17th December 1921 (App. IX).\r\n\r\nAnd finally Sir Ludovic Porter, a member of the Government, described\r\nthe whole situation, including the various efforts that were being made\r\nby the Non-co-operators on the 23rd of January 1922 (App. X). This will\r\nexplain also the nature of the associations of volunteers formed under\r\nthe Resolution of the Congress already referred to, their efforts and\r\ntheir illegal character. And more recently we now hear of far more\r\nserious disturbances in Gorakhpur where a mob of volunteers and\r\nvillagers about 2000 in number led by the former killed 21 policemen and\r\nchowkidars (App. XII) and at Rai Bareilly where there was a serious\r\ncollision. In order to understand the _modus operandi_ I give an\r\nofficial narrative of the events at Barabanki (App. XI). About Behar we\r\nhave the speech of Mr. Macpherson, a member of Council, in which he\r\nrefers to the plans of the non-co-operation party to win Swaraj, gives\r\nthe organization of the national volunteers describes how the Government\r\noffices were to be taken possession of, civil disobedience was to be\r\nstarted, gives the deplorable conditions in various districts brought\r\nabout by the non-co-operation campaign and describes the revolutionary\r\ncharacter of the movement in that province (App. XVI). The chief\r\nsecretary, Mr. Hammond, in his speech gives various instances of tyranny\r\npractised by the non-co-operation volunteers, a practical speech which\r\nproves his contention (App. XVII). In Bengal, on Nov. 20 Lord Ronaldshay\r\ndrew attention to the nature of Gandhi Swaraj and Turkish administration\r\n(App. XIII). In Nov. 1921, he spoke about the intended boycott of the\r\nPrince of Wales (App. XIII). In another speech he pointed out the lies\r\nthat were being spread about the bombardment of Mecca (App. XIII). In\r\nDec. 1921, he described the activities which led to the interference of\r\nGovernment. A brief extract will be found in (App. XII). Finally, in\r\nFeb. 1922, he made a lengthy reference to the political outlook (App.\r\nXIII). In the Legislative Council Sir Henry Wheeler a member of\r\nGovernment described the situation (App. XV).\r\n\r\nIn the Legislative Assembly also the matter was fully discussed in Jan.\r\n1922. Sir William Vincent summed up the situation, various instances of\r\ntheir activities among which will be found a particularly revolting\r\nstatement about the corpse of a diseased person who was loyal to the\r\nGovernment, and therefore obnoxious to Gandhi's party, being dug out of\r\nthe grave (App. XXIII).\r\n\r\nThis completes my review of the situation. Considerations of space have\r\ncompelled me to exclude many speeches which would throw further light on\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nI will, therefore, content myself with giving a list of the disturbances\r\nand riots throughout India, due to Gandhi's movement supplied to me by\r\nthe Legislative Department of the Government of India (App. XXII).\r\n\r\nIn February 1922 Mr. Gandhi issued an ultimatum to the Government of\r\nIndia that if within a certain period of time his demands formulated in\r\nhis ultimatum were not conceded he would start what is called mass civil\r\ndisobedience at Bardoli, that is to say, the people of Bardoli would be\r\nasked to refuse to pay taxes etc. The Government of India issued a\r\ncommunique in reply in which reviewing the situation they pointed out\r\nthe grave dangers that would follow such civil disobedience and gave him\r\na stern warning (App. XIX).\r\n\r\nThis attitude no doubt surprised him. The Government he thought was on\r\nthe run, when they had submitted meekly to his contemptuous refusal for\r\na conference at Calcutta and he had apparently therefore expected them\r\nto beg for an armistice. There was a remarkable change. He or rather the\r\nworking committee of the Congress suspended mass civil disobedience\r\nhaving found a pretext in the occurrence of a riot about this time at\r\nGorakhpur. So far as the campaign against the Government is concerned\r\nthe following are the important resolutions:--\r\n\r\n \"The working Committee of the Congress resolves that mass civil\r\n disobedience contemplated at Bardoli and elsewhere be suspended and\r\n instructs the local Congress Committees forthwith to advise the\r\n cultivators to pay the land revenue and other taxes due to the\r\n Government and whose payment might have been suspended in anticipation\r\n of mass civil disobedience and instructs them to suspend every other\r\n preparatory activity of an offensive nature.\" \"The suspension of mass\r\n civil disobedience shall be continued till the atmosphere is so\r\n non-violent as to ensure the non-repetition of popular atrocities such\r\n as at Gorakhpur, or hooliganism such as at Bombay and Madras\r\n respectively on the 17th November, 1921 and 13th January last. In order\r\n to promote a peaceful atmosphere the working Committee advises till\r\n further instruction, all Congress organisations to stop activities\r\n specially designed to court arrest and imprisonment, save normal\r\n Congress activities including voluntary hartals wherever an absolutely\r\n peaceful atmosphere can be assured, and for that end all picketing\r\n shall be stopped save for the bona fide and peaceful purpose of warning\r\n the visitors to liquor shops against the evils of drinking. Such\r\n picketing to be controlled by persons of known good character and\r\n specially selected by the Congress Committee concerned.\"\r\n\r\n \"The working Committee advises, till further instructions, the stoppage\r\n of all volunteer processions and public meetings merely for the purpose\r\n of defiance of the notification regarding such meetings. This, however,\r\n shall not interfere with the private meetings of the Congress and other\r\n committees or public meetings which are required for the conduct of the\r\n normal activities of the Congress\".\r\n\r\n The working Committee advised all Congress organisations to be engaged\r\n in the following activities:--\r\n\r\n \"To enlist at least one crore of members of the Congress. The workers\r\n should note that no one who does not pay the annual subscription can be\r\n regarded as a qualified congressman.\"\r\n\r\n \"To continue the Swaraj fund and to call upon every Congressman or\r\n Congress-sympathiser to pay at least one hundredth part of his annual\r\n income for the year 1921. Every province to send every month 25 per\r\n cent of its income from the Tilak Memorial Swaraj fund to the All-India\r\n Congress Committee.\"\r\n\r\nThe above resolutions were directed to be placed before the All-India\r\nCongress Committee for revision if necessary. They were accordingly\r\nbrought before the All-India Congress Committee whose Resolution runs\r\nthus.\r\n\r\n \"The All-India Congress Committee have carefully considered the\r\n resolutions passed by the Working Committee at its meeting held at\r\n Bardoli on the 11th and 12th instant, confirms the said resolutions\r\n with the modifications noted herein and _further resolves that\r\n individual civil disobedience whether of a defensive or aggressive\r\n character, may be commenced in respect of particular places or\r\n particular laws, at the instance of, and upon permission being granted\r\n therefore, by the respective provincial Committee_.\r\n\r\n \"Provided that such civil disobedience shall not be permitted unless all\r\n the conditions laid down by the Congress or the All-India Congress\r\n Committee or the Working Committee are strictly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n \"Reports having been received from various quarters that picketing\r\n regarding foreign cloth is as necessary as liquor picketing, the\r\n All-India Congress Committee _authorises such picketing_ of a bona fide\r\n character on the same terms as liquor picketing mentioned in the\r\n Bardoli resolutions.\r\n\r\n \"The All-India Congress Committee wishes it to be understood that the\r\n resolutions of the Working Committee do not mean an abandonment of the\r\n original Congress programme of non-co-operation or the permanent\r\n abandonment of mass civil disobedience, but considers that an\r\n atmosphere of necessary mass non-violence can be established by the\r\n workers concentrating upon the constructive programme framed by the\r\n Working committee at Bardoli. The All-India Congress Committee holds\r\n civil _disobedience to be the right and duty of the people to be\r\n exercised and performed whenever the State opposed the declared will of\r\n the people_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n Note.--Individual civil disobedience is disobedience of orders or laws\r\n by a single individual or an ascertained number or group of\r\n individuals. Therefore, a prohibited public meeting where admission is\r\n regulated by tickets and to which no unauthorised admission is allowed,\r\n is an instance of individual civil disobedience whereas a prohibited\r\n meeting to which the general public is admitted without any\r\n restriction, is an instance of mass civil disobedience.\r\n\r\n Such civil disobedience is defensive, when a prohibited public meeting\r\n is held for conducting a normal activity although it may result in\r\n arrest. It would be aggressive, if it is held, not for any activity,\r\n but merely for the purpose of courting arrest and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThis shows that there is practically no change in the situation. This\r\nmay be read with the resolution of the congress 28th Dec. 1921 (App.\r\nXX). Gandhi's agitation continues revolutionary.\r\n\r\nFor more than thirty years the constitutional Reform party have been\r\nfighting for various indispensable reforms in the administration of the\r\ncountry with but moderate success. At last however, in 1919 they\r\nobtained a Reform scheme which brought India directly on to the path\r\nleading to Home Rule. In fact the Reform Act made Home Rule inevitable\r\nwithin a comparatively short time, and indicated the nature of the\r\nconstitutional methods of its early attainment. Mr. Gandhi was in India\r\nfor some years before that date. He scarcely lent any assistance to the\r\nReform party. Considering his principles he could not. After having\r\nobtained the Act, the Reform party proceeded to work it, to carry out\r\nthe administrative reforms needed, to educate the masses to enable them\r\nto claim and exercise larger political powers, in order to claim at as\r\nearly a date as possible that further instalment of Reform provided for\r\nand contemplated in the act itself. Mr. Gandhi is standing right athwart\r\ntheir path, thus preventing or at least retarding and dangerously\r\nimperilling the indispensable reforms, regardless of the sufferings of\r\nthe people entailed thereby, in order to carry out his own wild\r\nprinciples which have not the slightest chance of acceptance provided\r\nthey are understood by the people of the country for what they are,\r\nemotional speculations without any considered relation to existing\r\nconditions. Mr. Gandhi, to take him at his best is indifferent to facts.\r\nFacts must submit to the dictates of his theories. The only difficulty\r\nin his way is that they don't. Will o'the wisp politics are not of use\r\nto a people who have to live in a world which, from long and bitter\r\nexperience, has at last come to realise that dreams of distorted brains\r\nare not the stuff of which contented Nations are made. Gandhi in fact is\r\nseeking not only to destroy the fruits of the long endeavour of the\r\nconstitutional reformers, but blast for ever any hopes of Indian\r\nregeneration.\r\n\r\nTo push forward the working of the Act has been the work before the\r\nReform party which he is thus so perniciously thwarting. They had to\r\ntake up in the Legislative Councils the question of the redress of the\r\ngrievances under which the people suffered, not only to agitate for\r\ntheir removal, but to show the people that by constitutional agitation\r\nsooner or later they can get what they want. The most important question\r\nwith which the constitutional Reformers had to deal was one concerning\r\nthe great poverty of the country. For this it is necessary to consider\r\nthe question of the Land Tax--its nature, incidents, relation to other\r\ntaxes, its necessity, the distribution of the land produce between the\r\nGovernment and the classes that own the land. This is a question in\r\nwhich the landholding classes are very much interested. They would have\r\nunderstood the arguments addressed to them and therefore it would have\r\nserved as a means of political and social education. The Councils have\r\nalready been dealing with it, and, considering the conditions,\r\nsatisfactorily. The Government have been meeting them in a sympathetic\r\nspirit and are trying to give effect to their proposals as much as\r\npossible. What is Mr. Gandhi's advice? He does not seek to co-operate to\r\nmake the tax less oppressive. He would have the people pay no land tax\r\nto Government. Only the dreadful consequences that would ensue prevent\r\nhim in this case, from giving full effect to his intentions. In any\r\ncase, it is not the oppressive nature of the tax that he relies on, nor\r\nis it alleged that it is an innovation of the British Government, which\r\nof course it is not. He objects to the tax, not for itself, but because\r\nit is another weapon with which to destroy the Government.\r\n\r\nA cognate question is that which arises between the landlords and\r\ntenants. In this also all the landholding classes are deeply interested,\r\nand a discussion of the nature of the distribution of the produce\r\nbetween the landlord, farmer and agricultural labourer would have been\r\nof great educative value. The Legislative Councils are dealing with the\r\nquestion. Government in this matter also are showing the greatest\r\npossible consideration for the feelings of the people of the country.\r\nYet Mr. Gandhi and his friends would not only take no part in the\r\ndeliberations of the council but would prevent an amicable settlement by\r\nsteps which have produced riots between the classes interested in the\r\nland, with the object of discrediting the Reform Scheme and paralysing\r\nthe Government of the country.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this is the question of Indian manufactures,\r\nindustries and the development of mineral resources, which, besides,\r\nconferring other benefits, will relieve undue pressure on the land. Our\r\nindustries have been destroyed by English competition and constitutional\r\nreformers are determined to take all the steps necessary to enter into\r\nhealthy competition with English industries in Indian interests and to\r\ndevelop their own mineral and other resources. In so doing they have to\r\ntake care that the conditions which accompanied the rise of industrial\r\nprosperity in the West are not reproduced in India. They have to see\r\nthat wage earners received adequate protection. What are the tactics of\r\nMr. Gandhi and his friends? All these industries are to him the\r\ndevil's-own agency to destroy the soul. He says they cannot add an inch\r\nto India's moral stature. Starvation due to the absence of industries\r\nmay destroy the body and certainly hinders the development of the soul.\r\nBut to him this does not matter. He and his followers would taboo\r\nmachinery, without which competition or development is hopeless. Without\r\nattempting to promote an amicable settlement between English capitalists\r\nand Indian labourers they have on the contrary been responsible for a\r\ndeliberate widening of the chasm between the races.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice is another matter in which all are\r\ninterested; and already the Legislative Councils are dealing with the\r\nquestion of the separation of Judicial and Executive functions. The\r\nGovernment again are not only not standing in their way but are\r\nrendering every assistance towards the solution of the problem. This is\r\nalso the case with reference to the removal of discriminations between\r\nEuropeans and Indians in the administration of justice. The people of\r\nthe country understand this question well as they are deeply interested\r\nin it. Mr. Gandhi is asking the people of the country to avoid all\r\ncourts and thus not to interest themselves in the improvement of\r\njudicial administration.\r\n\r\nI might take many other questions relating to finances, army, etc., and\r\nshow the baneful influence of his propaganda. In all these Mr. Gandhi's\r\ncampaign against Government has hampered the reformers who would\r\notherwise have made the redress of these grievances a more effective\r\nplank in their platform; these questions would have been more widely\r\ndiscussed throughout the country. But such discussion is now almost\r\nimpossible with the result that these questions are not settled as\r\nsatisfactorily as they might otherwise be. But it is as regards\r\neducation that the reformers have most felt the want of that popular\r\nsupport necessary to carry out the reforms needed.\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi will never be forgiven by all true lovers of sound National\r\nEducation for India for the campaign he has carried on against real\r\neducation. The education that has been hitherto imparted had been as\r\neverybody, including Mr. Gandhi also recognised, lamentably defective.\r\nThe reformers had to insist on the imparting of suitable primary\r\neducation to the masses, to the workers, to the labouring men and\r\nothers, to enable them to improve their condition, because no class can\r\ngenerally rise except under the ultimate stress of its own will and\r\nability. They had to demand suitable higher education, which was\r\nrequired not only in the interests of the culture but also for the\r\nindustrial regeneration of the country and for the development of\r\nIndia's natural resources. In the laboratories of Europe, America and\r\nJapan students are devoting themselves to discover means for the\r\nalleviation of misery and pain. Nay, higher claims are advanced, for it\r\nhas been declared by scientists that we are on the eve of discovery of\r\nmeans for a practically indefinite prolongation of life under certain\r\nconditions which make us intensely expectant to know whether they are\r\nthe same as described in our ancient books as efficacious for that\r\npurpose, descriptions which have hitherto been contemptuously discarded\r\nas worthless. Archaeologists are almost every day unveiling to us\r\nancient remains and writings which give us a different and a startling\r\nconception of ancient History and Civilisation. Indian History is being\r\nrewritten. When we hear of the Marconi wireless, our young men turn to\r\nour own ancient descriptions of the training of human body and mind\r\nwhich make these fit to receive and convey messages regardless of space\r\nand distance and they show eagerness to take part in experiment and\r\nresearch. When we find rays penetrating solid matter, our young\r\nscientists wonder whether after all the stories of great seers whose\r\nvision, not of the material eye, is not bounded by time or space or\r\ndistance, may not be true and wonder whether we should not now take up\r\nthe training prescribed to attain those results. Researches are made in\r\nthe laboratories to control the forces of nature, to increase human\r\ncomforts and happiness, to increase productivity in all directions.\r\nResearches have already attained brilliant results. The lessons of the\r\nsurvey of the regions above by the telescope, of all below by the\r\nmicroscope, and generally speaking all these marvels of science which\r\nlend fresh light and new significance to the lesson of ancients as to\r\nthe all pervading of the universe are all anathema to Mr. Gandhi.\r\n\r\nHe wants to hold back our boys from the Universities and post-graduate\r\nstudies and research that they may go back to their ploughs while the\r\nUniversities of the Western world are sending their delegates all over\r\nthe world to take stock of what has been done and to devise means for\r\nthe intellectual and moral uplift of the Nations.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional reformers and the Councils have the great task before\r\nthem of reconciling the Hindus and Mahomedans on a basis for their unity\r\nother than the one which arose out of the Mahomedan fury against the\r\nBritish Government for its failure to support Mahomedan interests in the\r\nWest. They have also to promote goodwill between the Hindus and the\r\nMahomedans on the one side and the Europeans on the other, both in India\r\nand in the colonies. They have to face the rising antagonism between the\r\ndark, the fair and the white--an antagonism which threatens in course of\r\ntime to engulf the whites with all that modern civilisation, whatever be\r\nits faults, is standing for. The Reform party want India to take her\r\nrightful place in the Indo-British commonwealth, the first place, in\r\nfact, to which her natural genius and her resources entitle her, with\r\nall its responsibilities. The conditions are all favourable to India.\r\nGovernorships of Provinces are thrown open to Indians. There are Indians\r\nin the Viceroy's and other Councils. But Mr. Gandhi and his friends will\r\nnot only do practically nothing in that direction but they have created\r\nwhat threatens to be a permanent gulf between the Mahomedans and\r\nnon-Mahomedans, and they are dangerously widening the gulf between the\r\nIndians and Europeans. The reformers have to improve the conditions of\r\nwomen both amongst the Mahomedans and the Hindus, as without such\r\nimprovement India is not entitled to take her place among civilised\r\nnations. They have practically to get rid of the caste system as with\r\nsuch a cancer political progress is impossible. Mr. Gandhi, on the other\r\nhand, panders to Mahomedan vanity and justifies the racial differences\r\nas between different classes of Hindus. He insists upon the necessity of\r\nour going back to our own caste system, which is responsible for the\r\ncondition of our women and of the lower classes. He has given a handle\r\nto those who want to maintain the repressive laws, and is really\r\nresponsible for the retention of them. He has not only thrown doubts as\r\nto our fitness for Self-Government but has rendered it possible for our\r\nopponents to urge with plausibility that danger would accrue to the\r\nEmpire and to India itself by granting Home Rule to India. He has thus\r\nto the best of his sinister ability attempted to prevent all reforms and\r\nhas tried to paralyse all the efforts of the reformers in every\r\ndirection, fomenting racial and class differences, as I have already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we see a class of narrow thought in the white world raising\r\nthe colour sentiment against the Asiatics, and against Indians in\r\nparticular, proclaiming that there is no place for Indians in British\r\nEmpire on terms of equality. These are not the intellectual leaders of\r\nthe white races, nor are they those who set the best standards of\r\nmorality. On the other hand, we see the noblest of them proclaiming and\r\nstriving with all their might, with varying degrees of success, to\r\nenforce the opposite ideal. We know also that in India the question is\r\nonly one of time and within a short period absolute equality in every\r\nrespect will be carried out. We see further that our countrymen\r\nelsewhere are weak and comparatively helpless, and till we in India\r\nattain our manhood they must continue at the mercy of the white races.\r\nWhat is it, then, that not only Religion, Universal morality, or good,\r\nbut also policy and prudence, dictate? There can be only one answer. We\r\nmust strengthen the hands of those who are fighting for race equality\r\nand give no opportunity to those who maintain that the Indians are a\r\nperil to the white race. What is Mr. Gandhi doing? He is doing\r\neverything possible to increase racial and class hatred.\r\n\r\nWe see the wonderful phenomenon of Australian ladies begging pardon for\r\nthe atrocious treatment of their Indian sisters by a few Englishmen in\r\nFiji and elsewhere. We see the Universities and Professors, ashamed of\r\nthemselves for their aberration during the great War, hastening to make\r\namends by trying to bring together all classes and races of men. We see\r\nwhite women trying to band themselves and other women of whatever colour\r\nand creed into one sisterhood, without any difference, to throw\r\nthemselves into all social and political movements for sex\r\nenfranchisement and uplift; to work for the good not only of themselves\r\nbut of children in particular, and generally to devote themselves to all\r\nactivities of mercy. We find various Nations calling to one another\r\nacross seas, deserts and mountains to join in a common fellowship, not\r\nto work in opposition to one another. Every where, after the fearful\r\ncataclysm through which we have passed, there is wistful yearning for\r\nfellowship and brother-hood to carry out in practice the teachings of\r\nthe ancient prophets and seers, Buddha, Confucius, Zoroaster, the seers\r\nof the Upanishads, Christ, Mahomed, in opposition to the Churches and\r\nthe dogmatic religions identified with their names. And is it not\r\nextraordinary, we see this man, uninfluenced by this tremendous\r\nintellectual and moral up-heaval, waging a bloody and racial struggle\r\nfor what? that if successful Indians may not take part in any of these\r\nmovements, shun them all, since God has not created man with his limited\r\nmeans of natural locomotion to labour for general good, and may\r\ntherefore, retire to their village to lead a solitary life.\r\n\r\nIf he had followed this advice for himself, or had retired to the\r\nHimalayas to live a mahatmaic life he would have saved the lives\r\nliterally of thousands, prevented horrible outrages worse than death,\r\nsaved thousands from incalculable misery. Instead of paying the penalty\r\nthemselves, he and his lieutenants stalk about the country dripping with\r\nthe blood of the victims of their policy.\r\n\r\nWho is responsible for all this? The Government of India cannot divest\r\nthemselves of their responsibility and India will hold the Indian\r\nmembers primarily responsible for the present situation. For no Viceroy\r\nwill venture to disregard their advice in a matter of this sort. They do\r\nnot seem to have strengthened the fibre of the Government. Nor have the\r\nLegislative Councils who also must share the responsibility advanced the\r\nclaim for the transfer of the administration of justice to popular\r\ncontrol. The Gandhi movement will no doubt collapse by internal\r\ndisruption as it is composed of various elements, drawn from Tolstoy\r\nLenin communism, socialism, Rigid Brahmanism, militant Mahomedanism\r\nmutually repellent and explosive when they come into contact with one\r\nanother and already producing the natural terrible results. But before\r\nthe final collapse comes it will have produced appalling misery and\r\nbloodshed unless it is dealt with firmly and with statesmanship. The\r\nGovernment should give Mr. Gandhi and some of his chief lieutenants who\r\naccept the whole programme the rest, they sadly need. And the Congress\r\nand the Khilafat associations must be treated as they themselves wish to\r\nbe treated as disloyal illegal associations.\r\n\r\nSince the above lines were written Mr. Gandhi has been arrested, tried\r\nand convicted. He pleaded guilty to the charges framed against him. His\r\nstatements are worthy of careful attention (App. XXI). He said \"I wish\r\nto endorse all the blame that the learned Advocate-General has thrown on\r\nmy shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrences, Madras\r\noccurrences and the Chauri Chaura occurrences. Thinking over these\r\ndeeply and sleeping over them night after night, it is impossible for me\r\nto dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chauri Chaura or the\r\nmad outrages of Bombay.\" He is quite right when he says, that \"as a man\r\nof responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education,\r\nhaving had fair share of experience of this world, I should have known\r\nthe consequences of every one of my acts. _I knew that I was playing\r\nwith fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the\r\nsame._ I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty,\r\nif I did not say what I said here just now.\" A man who says that if set\r\nfree he would still pursue the same course though aware of the\r\nconsequences of his acts is not a safe leader. There are signs however\r\nof a general recognition throughout the country that Mr. Gandhi's\r\ntheories are no longer suitable as a guide for political action. The\r\nMaharashtra party have apparently resolved to seek admission into the\r\nLegislative councils. The Central Provinces are also apparently of the\r\nsame opinion. A large section of Bengal represented by the Chitagong\r\nconference apparently hold the same view. In Madras a considerable\r\nsection is inclined to agree. But there is little doubt that it would\r\ntake a long time to eradicate the feeling of hatred that has been roused\r\nby Mr. Gandhi throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAs I left the Government of India long before the campaign of\r\nnon-co-operation was launched, perhaps there is nothing inappropriate in\r\nthe few observations which I propose to make regarding the delay in\r\ntaking action against Mr. Gandhi and his followers. In September 1920\r\nthe Congress adopted the non-co-operation resolution. The Government\r\nmight then have taken action with the support of a large majority of\r\nIndian politicians. After the final adoption of a non-co-operation\r\nprogramme by the Nagpur Congress it was felt that the Government should\r\nhave stopped the activities of the party which from that moment had\r\nopenly declared their disloyalty. They maintained their silence however\r\neven after Gandhi and the Congress party resolved on the recruitment of\r\nvolunteers and the organisation of a parallel Government. On the arrest\r\nand trial of the Ali Brothers Mr. Gandhi challenged the Government to\r\narrest him as he maintained that the conduct of the Ali Brothers in\r\ntampering with the loyalty of the Sepoys and uttering sedition was only\r\nin pursuance of the policy adopted by himself and the congress. His\r\nwords are remarkable. \"The National Congress began to tamper with the\r\nloyalty of the sepoys in September last year, _i.e._ 1920 the Central\r\nKhilafat Committee began it earlier and I began it earlier still, for I\r\nmust be permitted to take the credit or the odium of suggesting, that\r\nIndia had a right openly to tell the sepoy and everyone who served the\r\nGovernment in any capacity whatsoever that he participated in the wrongs\r\ndone by the Government.\"--\"Every non-co-operator is pledged to preach\r\ndisaffection towards the Government established by law.\r\nNon-co-operation, though, a religious and strictly moral movement,\r\ndeliberately aims at the overthrow of the Government, and is therefore\r\nlegally seditious in terms of the Indian Penal Code. But this is no new\r\ndiscovery. Lord Chelmsford knew it. Lord Reading knows it\" ... \"we must\r\nreiterate from a thousand platforms the formula of the Ali Brothers\r\nregarding the sepoys, and we must spread disaffection openly and\r\nsystematically till it pleases the Government to arrest us.\" It will\r\nhardly be believed that even after this no steps were taken against him.\r\nTowards the end of the year he said \"Lord Reading must clearly\r\nunderstand that the non-co-operators are at war with the Government.\r\nThey have declared rebellion against it.\" It was after this that there\r\nwas an attempt to bring about a conference between him and the\r\nGovernment which was contemptuously brushed aside by him. One of the\r\nmopla leaders when tried for rebellion pleaded that he was under the\r\nimpression that the British Government no longer ruled the country and\r\nhad abdicated. There is very little doubt of the unfortunate fact that\r\nthere was a general belief that the Government was powerless and could\r\nbe safely defied by Gandhi and his congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nVICEROY'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A few Europeans and many Hindus, have been murdered, communications\r\nhave been obstructed, Government offices burnt and looted and records\r\nhave been destroyed, Hindu temples sacked, houses of Europeans and\r\nHindus burnt, according to reports Hindus were forcibly converted to\r\nIslam and one of the most fertile tracts of South India is faced with\r\ncertain famine. The result has been the temporary collapse of the Civil\r\nGovernment, the offices and Courts have ceased to function and ordinary\r\nbusiness has been brought to a standstill. European and Hindu refugees\r\nof all classes are concentrated at Calicut and it is satisfactory to\r\nnote that they are safe there. One trembles to think of the consequences\r\nif the forces of order had not prevailed for the protection of Calicut.\r\nThe non Muslim in these parts was fortunate indeed that either he or his\r\nfamily or his house or property came under the protection of the\r\nsoldiers and the police. Those who are responsible for causing this\r\ngrave outbreak of violence and crime must be brought to justice and made\r\nto suffer the punishment of the guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of violent preaching\r\n\r\n\"But apart from direct responsibility, can it be doubted that when poor\r\nunfortunate and deluded people are led to believe that they should\r\ndisregard the law and defy authority, violence and crime must follow?\r\nThis outbreak is but another instance on a much more serious scale and\r\namong a more turbulent and fanatical people, of the conditions that have\r\nmanifested themselves at times in various parts of the country and,\r\ngentlemen, I ask myself and you and the country generally what else can\r\nbe the result from instilling such doctrines into the minds of the\r\nmasses of the people? How can there be peace and tranquility when\r\nignorant people, who have no means of testing the truth of the\r\ninflamatory and too often deliberately false statements made to them,\r\nare thus misled by those whose design is to provoke violence and\r\ndisorder. Passions are thus easily excited to unreasoning fury.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leader of the Movement\r\n\r\n\"Although, I freely acknowledge that the leader of the movement to\r\nparalyse authority, persistently, and, as I believe, in all earnestness\r\nand sincerity, preaches the doctrine of non-violence and has even\r\nreproved his followers for resorting to it, yet again and again it has\r\nbeen showed that his doctrine is completely forgotten and his\r\nexhortations absolutely disregarded when passions are excited as must\r\ninevitably be the consequence among emotional people.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts inevitable result\r\n\r\n\"To those who are responsible for the peace and good government of this\r\ngreat Empire and I trust that to all men of sanity and common sense in\r\nall classes of society, it must be clear that the defiance of the\r\nGovernment and constituted authority can only result in widespread\r\ndisorder, in political chaos, in anarchy and in ruin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nDIABOLICAL ATROCITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalicut, Sept. 7--In my first article I dealt with the prime causes of\r\nthe present outbreak, the dangerous game played by the leaders of the\r\nKhilafat and Non-Co-operation movements in Malabar which set the whole\r\nof Ernad and Walluvanad ablaze, and the extent of plunders, murders and\r\nforcible conversions committed by the Mopla rebels. In this article I\r\nintend to confine myself to the nature of the atrocities committed by\r\nthem and other details.\r\n\r\nThe experiences I am about to relate will satisfy every Hindu endowed\r\nwith ordinary common sense that the Moplas resorted to most repugnant\r\nfanaticism, which may be ascribed to nothing but selfishness, love of\r\nmoney and love of power, which are the prominent features of the present\r\noutbreak. Refugees narrate that, after forcibly removing young and fair\r\nNair and other high caste girls from their parents and husbands, the\r\nMopla rebels stripped them of their clothing and made them march in\r\ntheir presence naked, and finally they committed rape upon them. In\r\ncertain instances, devoid of human feelings and blinded by animal\r\npassion, the Moplas are alleged to have utilised a single woman for the\r\ngratification of the carnal pleasures of a dozen or more men. The rebels\r\nalso seem to have captured beautiful Hindu women, forcibly converted\r\nthem, pierced holes in their ears in the typical Mopla fashion, dressed\r\nthem as Mopla women and utilised them as their temporary partners in\r\nlife. Hindu women were threatened, molested and compelled to run\r\nhalf-naked for shelter to forests abounding in wild animals. Respectable\r\nHindu gentlemen were forcibly converted and the circumcision ceremony\r\nperformed with the help of certain Musaliars and Thangals. Hindu houses\r\nwere looted and set fire to, will not all these atrocities remain as a\r\nshameful image of the Hindu Muslim \"unity\", of which we have heard much\r\nfrom the Non-Co-operation Party and Khilafat-wallahs? The ghastly\r\nspectacle of a number of Hindu damsels being forced to march naked in\r\nthe midst of a number of licentious Moplas cannot be forgotten by any\r\nself respecting Hindu, nor can it be erased from their minds. On the\r\nother hand, I have never heard of the modesty of a Mopla woman being\r\noutraged by a Mopla rebel. \"_Times of India._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nMALABAR'S AGONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Annie Besant\r\n\r\nIt would be well if Mr. Gandhi could be taken into Malabar to see with\r\nhis own eyes the ghastly horrors which have been created by the\r\npreaching of himself and his \"loved brothers,\" Muhommad and Shaukat Ali.\r\nThe Khilafat Raj is established there; on August 1, 1921, sharp to the\r\ndate first announced by Mr. Gandhi for the beginning of Swaraj and the\r\nvanishing of British Rule, a Police Inspector was surrounded by Moplas,\r\nrevolting against that Rule. From that date onwards thousands of the\r\nforbidden war-knives ware secretly made and hidden away, and on August\r\n20, the rebellion broke out, Khilafat flags were hoisted on Police\r\nStations and Government offices. Strangely enough it was on August 25th\r\n825 A.D. that Cherman Perumal ascended the throne of Malabar, the first\r\nZamorin, and from that day the Malayalam Era is dated that is still in\r\nuse; thus for 1096 years a Zamorin has ruled in Calicut, and the Rajas\r\nare mostly Chiefs who for long centuries have looked to a Zamorin as\r\ntheir feudatory Head. These are the men on whom the true pacification of\r\nMalabar must ultimately depend. The crowded refugees will only return to\r\ntheir devastated homes when they see those once more in safety in their\r\nancestral places. Their lands, which they keep under their own control,\r\nare largely cultivated by Moplas, who are normally hardy, industrious\r\nagricultural labourers.\r\n\r\nOur correspondent has sent accounts of the public functions connected\r\nwith my hurried visit to Calicut and Palghat, and that which I wish to\r\nput on record here is the ghastly misery which prevails, the\r\nheart-breaking wretchedness which has been caused by the Mopla outbreak,\r\ndirectly due to the violent and unscrupulous attacks on the Government\r\nmade by the Non-Co-operators and the Khilafatists and the statements\r\nscattered broadcast, predicting the speedy disappearance of British\r\nRule, and the establishment of Swaraj, as proclaimed by the N.C.O. and\r\nKhilafat Raj as understood by the Moplas from the declarations of the\r\nKhilafatists. On that, there is no doubt whatever, so far as Malabar is\r\nconcerned. The message of the Khilafats, of England as the enemy of\r\nIslam, of her coming downfall, and the triumph of the Muslims, had\r\nspread, to every Mopla home. The harangues in the Mosques spread it\r\neverywhere, and Muslim hearts were glad. They saw the N.C.O. preachers\r\nappealing for help to their religious leaders, naturally identified the\r\ntwo. The Government was Satanic, and Eblis, to the good Muslim, is to be\r\nfought to the death. Mr. Gandhi may talk as he pleases about N.C.O.s\r\naccepting no responsibility. It is not what they accept; it is what\r\nfacts demonstrate. He accepted responsibility for the trifling bloodshed\r\nof Bombay. The slaughter in Malabar cries out his responsibility. N.C.O.\r\nis dead in Malabar. But bitter hatred has arisen there, as fighting men\r\nfrom the dragon's teeth of Theseus. That is the ghastly result of the\r\npreaching of Gandhism, of N.C.O. of Khilafatism. Every one speaks of the\r\nKhilafat Raj, and the one hope of the masses is in its crushing by the\r\nstrong arm of the Government. Mr. Gandhi asks the Moderates to compel\r\nthe Government to suspend hostilities, _i.e._, to let loose the wolves\r\nto destroy what lives are left. The sympathy of the Moderates is not, I\r\nmake bold to say, with the murderers, the looters, the ravishers, who\r\nhave put into practice the teachings of paralysing the Government of the\r\nN.C.O.'s, who have made \"war on the Government\" in their own way. How\r\ndoes Mr. Gandhi like the Mopla spirit, as shown by one of the prisoners\r\nin the Hospital, who was dying from the results of asphyxiation? He\r\nasked the surgeon, if he was going to die, and surgeon answered that he\r\nfeared he would not recover. \"Well, I'm glad I killed fourteen\r\ninfidels,\" said the Brave, God-fearing Mopla, whom Mr. Gandhi so much\r\nadmires, who \"are fighting for what they consider as religion, and in a\r\nmanner they consider as religious.\" Men who consider it \"religious\" to\r\nmurder, rape, loot, to kill women and little children, cutting down\r\nwhole families, have to be put under restraint in any civilised society.\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi was shocked when some Parsi ladies had their saries torn off,\r\nand very properly, yet the God-fearing hooligans had been taught that it\r\nwas sinful to wear foreign cloth, and doubtless felt they were doing a\r\nreligious act; can he not feel a little sympathy for thousands of women\r\nleft with only rags, driven from home, for little children born of the\r\nflying mothers on roads in refuge camps? The misery is beyond\r\ndescription. Girl wives, pretty and sweet, with eyes half blind with\r\nweeping, distraught with terror; women who have seen their husbands\r\nhacked to pieces before their eye, in the way \"Moplas consider as\r\nreligious\"; old women tottering, whose faces become written with anguish\r\nand who cry at a gentle touch and a kind look waking out of a stupor of\r\nmisery only to weep, men who have lost all, hopeless, crushed,\r\ndesperate, I have walked among thousands of them in the refugee camps,\r\nand some times heavy eyes would lift as a cloth was laid gently on the\r\nbare shoulder, and a faint watery smile of surprise would make the face\r\neven more piteous than the stupor. Eyes full of appeal, of agonised\r\ndespair, of hopeless entreaty of helpless anguish, thousands of them\r\ncamp after camp, \"Shameful inhumanity proceeding in Malabar,\" says Mr.\r\nGandhi. Shameful inhumanity indeed, wrought by the Moplas, and these are\r\nthe victims, saved from extermination by British and Indian swords, For\r\nbe it remembered the Moplas began the whole horrible business; the\r\nGovernment intervened to save their victims and these thousands have\r\nbeen saved. Mr. Gandhi would have hostilities suspended--so that the\r\nMoplas may sweep down on the refugee camps, and finish their work?\r\n\r\nI visited in Calicut three huge Committee camps, two Christian, and the\r\nCongress building and compound where doles of rice are given daily from\r\n7 A.M. to noon. In all, the arrangements were good. Big thatched sheds,\r\nand some buildings shelter the women and children, the men sleep\r\noutside. They are all managed by Indians, the Zamorini's Committee\r\ndistributing cloths and money to all, except the Congress committee,\r\nwhich work independently and gives food from its own resource. At\r\nPalghat, similar arrangements are made by the Zamorini's Committee, and\r\nthe order and care in feeding are good to see.\r\n\r\nLet me finish with a beautiful story told to me. Two Pulayas, the lowest\r\nof the submerged classes, were captured with others, and given the\r\nchoice between Islam and Death. These, the outcaste of Hinduism, the\r\nuntouchables, so loved the Hinduism which had been so unkind a\r\nstep-mother to them, that they chose to die Hindus rather than to live\r\nMuslim. May the God of both, Muslim and Hindus send His messengers to\r\nthese heroic souls, and give them rebirth into the Faith for which they\r\ndied. _New India, 29 November 1921._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilful murders of Hindus and arson were first begun in my own place by\r\nChembrasseri Thangal and his Lieutenant, another Thangal. You might have\r\nread accounts written by me in the Malabar journal which was sent to you\r\nlast time. This contagion began to spread like wild fire and we began to\r\nhear of murders daily. Within a fortnight cold-blooded murders of Hindus\r\nbecame very common. From within the borders of Calicut and Ernad taluks\r\nrefugees come in large numbers with tales of murders and atrocities\r\ncommitted by the rebels. At Puthur Amson in Ernad only 12 miles\r\nnortheast of Calicut--One day in broad daylight twenty-five persons who\r\nrefused to embrace Islam were butchered and put into a well. One out of\r\nthese who narrowly escaped death got out of the well when the rebels\r\nleft the place and ran to Calicut for life. He is now in the hospital.\r\nSo the accounts must be true as he himself was one of the victims.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week news of numerous murders and forcible conversions\r\ncame from another quarter also, Mannur near Aniyallur and Kadalundi\r\nrailway station in Ernad taluk. This place also is only 14 miles away\r\nfrom Calicut. Every train to Calicut was carrying with it daily hundreds\r\nof refugees during the last week. If there were ten thousand refugees\r\nfed by the Relief Committee last week, it must have fed fifteen thousand\r\nthis week. According to the statements given by them there must be at\r\nleast fifty murders and numerous cases of conversions and house-burning.\r\nCan you conceive of a more ghastly and inhuman crime than the murders of\r\nbabies and pregnant women? Two days back I had occasion to read a report\r\ngiven by a refugee in Calicut. A pregnant woman carrying 7 months was\r\ncut through the abdomen by a rebel and she was seen lying dead on the\r\nway with the dead child projecting out of the womb. How horrible!\r\nAnother: a baby of six months was snatched away from the breast of his\r\nown mother and cut into two pieces. How heart-rending! Are these rebels\r\nhuman beings or monsters? From the same quarters numerous forcible\r\nconversions are also reported. One refugee has given statement that he\r\nhad seen with his own eyes that the heads of a dozen people were being\r\nshaved by the rebels and afterwards they were asked to recite some\r\npassages from the _Quran_. This he witnessed from a tree. I wonder what\r\nis the authority of some people who contradict the news of murders, and\r\nforcible conversions of Hindus. Let them come here and test the veracity\r\nof these statements for themselves.\r\n\r\n'Yesterday another report of murders came from a place very near\r\nKottakal. The report says that eleven Hindus (males and females), were\r\nmurdered by the rebels.\r\n\r\n'A fortnight ago fifteen dead bodies of Hindus were seen under culvert\r\non the road between Perinialmanna and Melatur.'\r\n\r\nWill you not be sick of these stories of murders? All these reports\r\nare, as far as possible, proved also to be correct.\r\n\r\nWords fail to express my feelings of indignation and abhorrence which I\r\nexperienced when I came to know of an instance of rape, committed by the\r\nrebels under Chembrasseri Thangal. A respectable Nayar Lady at Melatur\r\nwas stripped naked by the rebels in the presence of her husband and\r\nbrothers, who were made to stand close by with their hands tied behind.\r\nWhen they shut their eyes in abhorrence they were compelled at the point\r\nof sword to open their eyes and witness the rape committed by the brute\r\nin their presence. I loathe even to write of such a mean action. I thank\r\nGod that my family and relatives reached safe at Calicut without being\r\ndishonoured by these brutes, though we sustained serious loss of\r\nproperty and the loss of four lives (two servants and two\r\nrelatives,--More afterwards). This instance of rape was communicated to\r\nme by one of her brothers confidentially. There are several instances of\r\nsuch mean atrocities which are not revealed by people. _New India 6th\r\nDec. 1921._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTruth is infinitely of more paramount importance than Hindu-Muslim unity\r\nor Swaraj, and therefore, we tell the Maulana Sahib and his\r\nco-religionists and India's revered leader Mahatma Gandhi--if he too is\r\nunaware of the events here--that atrocities committed by the Moplahs on\r\nthe Hindus are unfortunately too true and that there is nothing in the\r\ndeeds of Moplah rebels which a true non-violent non-co-operator can\r\ncongratulate them for. What is it for which they deserve congratulation?\r\nTheir wanton and unprovoked attack on the Hindus, the all but wholesale\r\nlooting at their houses in Ernad, and parts of Valluvanad, Ponnani, and\r\nCalicut Taliques; the forcible conversion of Hindus in a few places in\r\nthe beginning of the rebellion and the wholesale conversion of those who\r\nstick to their homes in its later stages, the brutal murder of\r\ninoffensive Hindus, men, women, and children in cold blood, without the\r\nslightest reason except that they are \"Kaffirs\" or belong to the same\r\nrace as the Policemen, who insulted their Tangals or entered their\r\nMosques, the desecration and burning of Hindu Temples the outrage on\r\nHindu women and their forcible conversion and marriage by Moplahs; do\r\nthese and similar atrocities proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by the\r\nstatements recorded by us from the actual sufferers who have survived,\r\ndeserve any congratulation? On the other hand should they not call forth\r\nthe strongest condemnation from all right-minded men and more especially\r\nfrom a representative body of Mohamedans like the Khilafat Conference\r\npledged to non-violence under all provocation?

The out-break commenced on the 20th of August, the\r\npolice and the District Magistrate withdrew from Tirunangadi to Calicut\r\non the 21st and the policemen throughout the affected area had taken to\r\ntheir heels. There was no adversary to the Moplahs at the time whom the\r\nHindus could possibly have helped or invited, and the attack on them was\r\nmost wanton and unprovoked.\r\n\r\nMADHAVAN NAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nProceedings of the conference at Calicut presided over by the Zamorin\r\nMaharaja.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. That the conference views with indignation and sorrow the attempts\r\nmade in various quarters by interested parties to ignore or minimise the\r\ncrimes committed by the rebels such as\r\n\r\n _a._ Brutally dishonouring women;\r\n\r\n _b._ Flaying people alive;\r\n\r\n _c._ Wholesale slaughter of men, women and children;\r\n\r\n _d._ Burning alive entire families;\r\n\r\n _e._ Forcibly converting people in thousands and slaying those who\r\n refused to get converted;\r\n\r\n _f._ Throwing half dead people into wells and leaving the victims for\r\n hours to struggle for escape till finally released from their\r\n sufferings by death;\r\n\r\n _g._ Burning a great many and looting practically all Hindu and Christian\r\n houses in the disturbed area in which even Moplah women and children\r\n took part, and robbing women of even the garments on their bodies, in\r\n short reducing the whole non-muslim population to abject destitution;\r\n\r\n _h._ Cruelly insulting the religious sentiments of the Hindus by\r\n desecrating and destroying numerous temples in the disturbed area,\r\n killing cows within the temple precincts putting their entrails on the\r\n holy image and hanging the skulls on the walls and roofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\nPetition of Malabar Ladies to Lady Reading\r\n\r\n\r\n TO\r\n HER GRACIOUS EXCELLENCY\r\n THE COUNTESS OF READING,\r\n Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe humble memorial of the bereaved and sorrow-stricken\r\nwomen of Malabar.\r\n\r\n MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACIOUS AND\r\n COMPASSIONATE LADYSHIP.\r\n\r\nWe, the Hindu women of Malabar of varying ranks and stations in life who\r\nhave recently been overwhelmed by the tremendous catastrophe known as\r\nthe Moplah rebellion, take the liberty to supplicate your Ladyship for\r\nsympathy and succour.\r\n\r\n2. Your Ladyship is doubtless aware that though our unhappy district has\r\nwitnessed many Moplah outbreaks in the course of the last one hundred\r\nyears, the present rebellion is unexampled in its magnitude as well as\r\nunprecedented in its ferocity. But it is possible that your Ladyship is\r\nnot fully appraised of all the horrors and atrocities perpetrated by the\r\nfiendish rebels; of the many wells and tanks filled up with the\r\nmutilated, but often only half dead bodies of our nearest and dearest\r\nones who refused to abandon the faith of our fathers; of pregnant women\r\ncut to pieces and left on the roadsides and in the jungles, with the\r\nunborn babe protruding from the mangled corpse; of our innocent and\r\nhelpless children torn from our arms and done to death before our eyes\r\nand of our husbands and fathers tortured, flayed and burnt alive; of our\r\nhapless sisters forcibly carried away from the midst of kith and kin and\r\nsubjected to every shame and outrage which the vile and brutal\r\nimagination of these inhuman hell-hounds could conceive of; of thousands\r\nof our homesteads reduced to cinder-mounds out of sheer savagery and a\r\nwanton spirit of destruction; of our places of worship desecrated and\r\ndestroyed and of the images of the deity shamefully insulted by putting\r\nthe entrails of slaughtered cows where flower garlands used to lie, or\r\nelse smashed to pieces; of the wholesale looting of hard earned wealth\r\nof generations reducing many who were formerly rich and prosperous to\r\npublicly beg for a piece or two in the streets of Calicut, to buy salt\r\nor chilly or betel-leaf--rice being mercifully provided by the various\r\nrelief agencies. These are not fables.\r\n\r\nThe wells full of rotting skeletons, the ruins which once were our dear\r\nhomes, the heaps of stones which once were our places of worship--these\r\nare still here to attest to the truth. The cries of our murdered\r\nchildren in their death agonies are still ringing in our ears and will\r\ncontinue to haunt our memory till death brings us peace. We remember how\r\ndriven out of our native hamlets we wandered starving and naked in the\r\njungles and forests; we remember how we choked and stifled our babies'\r\ncries lest the sound should betray our hiding places to our relentless\r\npursuers. We still vividly realise the moral and spiritual agony that\r\nthousand of us passed through when we were forcibly converted into the\r\nfaith professed by these blood thirsty miscreants; we still have before\r\nus the sight of the unendurable and life long misery of\r\nthose--fortunately few--of our most unhappy sisters who born and brought\r\nup in respectable families have been forcibly converted and then married\r\nto convict coolies. For five long months not a day has passed without\r\nits dread tale of horror to unfold.\r\n\r\n3. Your gracious Ladyship's distracted memorialists have endeavoured\r\nwithout exaggeration, without setting down aught in malice to convey at\r\nleast some idea of the indescribably terrible agonies which they and\r\nthousands more of their sisters have been enduring for over five months\r\nnow through this reign of inhuman frightfulness inaugurated and carried\r\non in the name of the Khilafhat. We have briefly referred without going\r\ninto their harrowing details to our heartrending tale of dishonour,\r\noutrage, rapine, and desolation. But if the past has been one of pain\r\nand anguish, the future is full of dread and gloom. We have to return to\r\na ruined and desolated land. Our houses have been burnt or destroyed;\r\nmay of our breadwinners killed; all our property looted; our cattle\r\nslaughtered. Repatriation without compensation means for us ruin,\r\nbeggary, starvation. Will not the benign Government come to our aid and\r\ngive us something to help us to begin life anew? We are now asked to\r\nsettle down as paupers in the midst of the execrable fiends who robbed,\r\ninsulted and murdered our loved ones--veritable demons such as hell\r\nitself could not let loose. Many of us shrink from the idea of going\r\nback to what there is left of our homes; for though the armed bands and\r\nrebels have been dispersed the rebellion cannot be said to be entirely\r\nquelled. It is like a venomous serpent whose spine has been partly\r\nbroken, but whose poison fangs are still intact and whose striking\r\npower, if diminished, has not been destroyed. A few thousands of rebels\r\nhave been killed and a few more thousands have been imprisoned, but as\r\nthe Government are only too well aware many more thousands of rebels,\r\nlooters, savagely militant evangelists and other inhuman monsters yet\r\nremain at large, a few in concealment, but most, moving about with\r\narrogance openly threatening reprisals on all non-moslims who dare to\r\nreturn and resume possession of their property. Many refugees who went\r\nback have paid for their temerity with their lives. In fact,\r\nrepatriation, if it is not to be a leap from the frying pan into the\r\nfire, must mean for the vast bulk of your Ladyship's impoverished and\r\nhelpless memorialists and their families a hard inexorable problem of\r\nfinancial help, and adequate protection against renewed hellish outrages\r\nfrom which immunity would be utterly impossible as long as thousands of\r\nmen and even women and children of this semi-savage and fanatical race\r\nin whom the worst instinct of earth hunger, blood-lust and rapine have\r\nbeen awakened to fierce activity are free to prey upon their peaceable\r\nand inoffensive neighbours who--let it be most respectfully\r\nemphasised--because of their implicit trust in the power and the will of\r\na just and benign Government to protect them, had suffered their own art\r\nand capacity for selfdefence to emasculate and decay.\r\n\r\n4. We, Your Ladyship's humble and sorrow-stricken memorialists do not\r\nseek vengeance. Our misery will not be rendered less by inflicting\r\nsimilar misery upon this barbarous and savage race; our dead will not\r\nreturn to us if their slayers are slaughtered. We would not be human,\r\nhowever, if we could ever forget the cruel and shameful outrages and\r\nindignities perpetrated upon us by a race to whom we have always\r\nendeavoured to be friendly and neighbourly; we would be hypocritical if,\r\nrobbed of all our possessions we did not plead for some measure of\r\ncompensation to help us out of the pauperism now forced upon us; we\r\nwould be imbecile, if knowing the ungovernable, anti-social propensities\r\nand the deadly religious fanaticism of the moplah race we did not\r\nentreat the just and powerful government to protect the lives and honour\r\nof your humble sisters who have to live in the rebel-ravaged zone. Our\r\nambition after all is low enough; sufficient compensation to save us and\r\nour children from starvation, and enough military protection against\r\nmassacre and outrage are all that we want. We beseech Your Compassionate\r\nLadyship to exercise all the benevolent influence that you possess with\r\nthe government to see that our humble prayers are granted. But if the\r\nbenign Government does not consider it possible to compensate us and to\r\nprotect us in our native land we would most fervently pray that free\r\ngrants of land may be assigned to us in some neighbouring region which\r\nthough less blessed with the lavish gifts of nature may also be less\r\ncursed by the cruelty and brutality of man.\r\n\r\n We beg to remain,\r\n Your Ladyship's most humble\r\n and obedient servants,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nON NON-CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\nBY M. R. JAYAKAR\r\n\r\n[We take the following extracts from the Presidential address of Mr. M.\r\nR. Jayakar at the Third Thana District Conference. Mr. Jayakar is a\r\nwell-known Non-Co-operator who believes in the \"principles and policy\"\r\nof the movement and who joined the movement because he realised that\r\n\"Our quarrel with the bureaucracy was far more substantial than our\r\ndifferences with the Congress Programme.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Failure of the Programme\r\n\r\nThe principles and the policy of the movement (N.C.O.) are substantially\r\nsound and have achieved unexpected success. But, with every month that\r\nhas passed, the need has been felt in many quarters of revising and\r\nadjusting the programme in the light of previous experience. When\r\ndispassionately judged by such experience it will be found that some\r\ndetails of the congress programme have not achieved the desired success;\r\non the contrary, they have formed weak links in the main. When these\r\nitems were undertaken they evoked a large volume of adverse criticism in\r\nthe ranks of Congress workers. Many of them have, no doubt, subordinated\r\ntheir differences, out of loyalty to the main cause, and quite a large\r\nnumber, out of their esteem and regard for the personality of the\r\nselfless and saintly promoter of the movement. But, notwithstanding this\r\nadmirable display of loyalty among Congress men, the fact remains and\r\nhas to be reckoned with, that many items have proved unsuccessful and\r\nperhaps act, in consequence as a clog on the movement. The soreness,\r\nwhich some of these details have caused, still remains and is operating\r\nto undivide some from others and makes them lukewarm or unwilling to\r\nthrow their whole heart into this movement. If these co-workers of ours\r\ncould be placated by a revision of the Congress programme, so that most\r\nof the earnest-minded workers for cause could substantially agree to its\r\nadoption, it would be a great advantage. And herein perhaps, lay the\r\nchief merit of the amendment moved by Mr. B. C. Pal, which was rejected\r\nby the majority at Calcutta. Taken at its highest, our success has not\r\ngone much beyond what that amendment would have made possible. It would\r\nhave had the further advantage of retaining within our ranks many of our\r\nformer associates, who are, at present, either lukewarm or hostile.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment in youthful sacrifice\r\n\r\nWhen once the necessity is recognized of revising the programme in the\r\nlight of these comments, which are being made throughout the country, it\r\nwill not be difficult to find out in what directions the programme has\r\nnot achieved the expected success and the reasons for the same. For\r\ninstance, the boycott of schools and colleges have not succeeded and\r\neven persons, of known and undoubted loyalty to the cause, complain that\r\nthe action of Congress workers has caused more harm than good. They\r\nconcentrated too much on the disruption of existing institutions and\r\nless on the creation and maintenance of new ones on \"national\" lines.\r\nThey forgot that a student cannot be left idle in the street and that,\r\nif the Congress must call him out, it can only be after it has provided\r\nfor him a good substitute. In Bombay we let pass the psychological\r\nmoment when we could have founded and reared up an excellent college\r\nwith various branches. Public enthusiasm was ripe for it in the early\r\npart of the year, but we let it evaporate in declamation and emotional\r\nexaltation. Some went so far as to suggest that it was no part of the\r\nCongress programme to start national Colleges though the terms of the\r\nCongress Resolution specially provided for it. 50000 boys are out in\r\nidleness, says Sir Ashutosh Mukherji, some may glorify in this\r\ncatastrophe, but there are many who regard this disruptive event with\r\nsad dismay. We have experimented too much in youthful sacrifice. Our\r\nyouth have reciprocated with more love and tenderness than we have shown\r\nfor their welfare. The few good institutions which Congress workers have\r\ncreated, are suffering from our neglect and apathy and dragging a weary\r\nexistence. The shadow of a name has, very often been pursued, to the\r\nabandonment of the substance, and we now find a large number of boys in\r\nthe country, who are practically loafing in the streets, with a vague\r\nambition \"to do something patriotic\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lawyer-Failure\r\n\r\nOur ban on lawyers has, likewise, not attained much success. Few\r\nlawyers, whose sacrifice of their practice has added strength to the\r\nCongress cause, have responded to the call. The prestige of British\r\ncourt in _civil_ Suits between an _Indian and Indian_ has not been\r\ndestroyed and can not be so easily destroyed; for, ordinarily this\r\nvariety of legal contests is not much colored with injustice, as\r\npolitical trials are. If lawyers had been called out, because, being a\r\ntrained class of workers, the country wanted their undivided time and\r\nattention at this critical hour, it would have been a different matter,\r\nand, perhaps, if the call had been so made many, many more would have\r\nresponded to it. But it was put the wrong way, and the lawyer was made\r\nto appear as if, in pursuing his profession, he was acting sinfully and\r\nmust atone for it by a complete withdrawal from practice. The result was\r\nthat, out of sheer self-respect, many really good lawyers have declined\r\nto respond to the call. Many could not give up their practice for\r\npecuniary reasons and were too honest to adopt subterfuges calculated to\r\ncreate a semblance of sacrifice. Lawyers have become \"pariahs\" of our\r\npresent political life. Some of them had borne the brunt of public\r\nagitation for more than two decades; their place is vacant and no class\r\nof workers of equal intelligence and keenness has come forward to take\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Foul Atmosphere\r\n\r\nThis part of the Congress programme has created a foul atmosphere of\r\nhypocrisy, intolerance, imposture and conceit in the Congress Camp, in\r\nwhich modesty, self-respect, and honesty often time find it hard to hold\r\ntheir place. In our enthusiasm, we forget that many lawyers value their\r\nprofession for the training it affords in courage, truthfulness, honor\r\nand toleration. No other profession trains a young man so well to\r\nwithstand and expose injustice and to uphold the tradition of truth and\r\nhonor. Our past political history of thirty-three years is a brilliant\r\nrecord of the services rendered by lawyers to the Congress cause. If a\r\ngreater sacrifice than before was needed now on their part, a direct\r\ncall on their self-respect and patriotism on this footing should have\r\nbeen made, but no good has arisen from putting the lawyer under the ban\r\nof ridicule and infamy. The call made upon them was singularly harsh. No\r\nother class of public workers was required to give up his means of\r\nlivelihood. The importing merchant supports British prestige as much as,\r\nif not more than the lawyer and yet he stalks unabashed in the Congress\r\ncamp without closing his shop. No ban was put on litigants, without whom\r\nthe lawyer cannot thrive. I am therefore, surprised that notwithstanding\r\nso much hardship, so many lawyers have come out and are to be found in\r\nthe vanguard of the movement. The few courts of justice, we called into\r\nexistence have not had enough support and are a mockery.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevise the Programme\r\n\r\nThe failure of these parts of the programme is now practically admitted\r\nand they are now pushed into the background. It would be better if, in\r\nrevising the programme in the next Session of the Congress, these limbs,\r\nwhich have ceased to function or respond to the laws of our growth, are\r\nboldly amputated. In any event, they make clear the necessity of a\r\nrevision, so as to render the programme more effective, elastic and\r\npractical.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter the Councils\r\n\r\nThe fight requires to be carried on in manifold ways. Some may carry it\r\nin the Councils, face to face with the officials. Why cannot\r\n\"Non-Co-operation,\" in its proper sense, be practised in the Councils?\r\nSir P. M. Mehta, when he left the Council Hall with his colleagues on a\r\nmemorable occasion when he, face to face with the then home member,\r\nmercilessly uncloacked the preposterous pretensions of the bureaucracy,\r\nwas fighting with weapons and a spirit which many Non-Co-operators of\r\nthe true and accredited brand may envy in these days. If\r\nNon-Co-operation is an _attitude_ of the mind, as its eminent author\r\nconceives it, and not so much a programme or a creed, a Council Hall is\r\nas fitting a place for its display as a mass meeting in a Marwadi\r\nVidyalaya. The spirit resides in the mind and is independent of the\r\nenvironment. It is no ground to say that, often times, the environment\r\nfrightens a weakling, for we do not build our doctrines only on the\r\npossibility of men being weak and timid.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.C.O. Concession\r\n\r\nWe have already departed from the original rigor of our programme in\r\nthis behalf. A Non-Co-operator can now compete at Municipal elections.\r\nHe can offer advice to Government in or outside private interviews.\r\nNon-co-operator papers do report the proceedings of the Legislative\r\nBodies, comment on them, and suggest remedies for the benefit of the\r\nGovernment. Scarcely a non-Co-operator now-a-days speaks without\r\nreferring to gubernatorial utterances and orders in Council. He comments\r\non the policies of Government, suggesting remedies as he goes on with\r\nhis comments. Several lawyers in Bombay, who are still in practice, are\r\nnow allowed to occupy prominent places as speakers at Non-Co-operation\r\nmeetings. This is as it should be, for we cannot afford to ignore or\r\ndespise, in the stinted state as our resources, the co-operation of any\r\nhonest workers, prepared to make a sacrifice commensurate with his\r\ncapacity. This is all done now silently and as a concession. My plea is\r\nfor making the programme so wide, elastic and natural, as to turn these\r\nconcessions into acknowledged rights. The Congress Creed calls upon us\r\nto obtain Swaraj by all legitimate and peaceful means. All weapons, all\r\navenues of work and all manner of public workers are enjoined on us, for\r\nthe attainment of the common end. Why set up ascetic standards,\r\nunpractical tests, and unnatural bans, which may often let in the\r\ndishonest but keep out the honest man, whose co-operation, even with a\r\ndifference, is often worth loving. The programme may become\r\ntheoretically less perfect, perhaps logically less consistent, but it\r\nwill certainly be more natural, real and effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested Modifications\r\n\r\nThe exact form of the modification must be left to future discussion. I\r\nwould, therefore, suggest as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) That foreign propaganda, so summarily put an end to at the last\r\nCongress, be resumed and if possible extended within proper bounds. The\r\nIndian view has to be put forward before the civilised world. This is an\r\nurgent need of the hour. The Government are doing it from their own\r\npoint of view, and we ought to do the same from ours.\r\n\r\n(2) That the time limited be abandoned, for reasons mentioned in para 25\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n(3) That the elections to Legislative Bodies, whenever a chance should\r\noccur, should be contested perhaps with the limitation, that in the\r\nProvinces, unless complete autonomy is introduced, Congressmen should\r\nnot accept office under the present system of Government. This may be,\r\nif so desired, made conditional on Government agreeing to dissolve the\r\npresent Bodies.\r\n\r\n(4) A large modification of the educational boycott, including the total\r\nabrogation of the compulsory part of it. Attention should be\r\nconcentrated more on the creation of national institutions than on the\r\nwithdrawal of students as a set propaganda. When such institutions are\r\nprojected, and some of them actually in existence, and they compete\r\nfavorably with state aided institutions, I have no doubt that sufficient\r\nimpulses have been generated in the country to secure the exercise of\r\nthe option in favor of the former. Side by side with this, an intensive\r\npropaganda should be carried on in the Councils and outside, having for\r\nits object the popularisation of the Universities by a change of the Act\r\ngoverning them, and also the \"nationalisation\" of the existing system of\r\nstate-aided education, so as to bring it into greater accord with the\r\npresent-day requirements and aspirations of the people. To me, it seems\r\nto be such a pity that we have deserted this avenue of agitation, to be\r\nfeebly utilised by a few persons in the present Councils, struggling\r\nagainst an unsuitable environment. Nine crores, which is nearly the\r\ntotal output on State education, we are not in a position to despise,\r\nand it seems wrong to wait for this reform till complete Swarajya is\r\nattained, which may or may not be for some time yet. Considerable harm\r\nhas been done to the cause of education by the exclusion of this avenue\r\nwork from the programme of Congress activities. The fate of primary\r\neducation in the Bombay presidency will clearly illustrate the point I\r\nam making.\r\n\r\n(5) A large modification of the ban against lawyers, so as to admit of\r\nseveral grades of sacrifice from complete abstention from practice to a\r\ngiving up of the entirety or a part of the earnings. A way should be\r\nfound for getting as many lawyers as possible to work in this movement\r\nprovided they are prepared to give the cause at least a part of their\r\ntime or money. The Congress ought to modify its call, so as to make it\r\npossible for all honest-minded lawyers to bear the burden of the\r\ncountry's cause, commensurate with their capacity to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the matter of conducting defences in British courts, some\r\ncurious departure have come to be made from the strict Congress rule.\r\nThese departures only indicate that, in its operation, the rule has been\r\nfound unpractical and irksome. Congressmen are not to engage pleaders\r\nnor offer a defence with legal aid. They are simply to make a\r\n\"statement.\" A statement is as much an aid to the administration of\r\njustice as a lawyer-made defence, and in so far, it equally supports the\r\nprestige of British courts. Only, it has the disadvantage of being\r\nprolix and unconvincing. It, therefore, fails of its mark more often\r\nthan a lawyer's defence.\r\n\r\nWho can urge that the long and interesting statements made by the Ali\r\nBrothers and their co-accused, in the trial at Karachi were out of\r\nplace? Yet they had all the features of a lawyer-made defence, as an aid\r\nto the court. The evidence was discussed, legal objections raised,\r\nrelevancy commented on and the prosecution evidence answered. All this\r\nassistance was given to the court, helping it to arrive at truth and\r\njustice, precisely in the same way as a practising lawyer aids judicial\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIf a statement is permitted, why cannot a lawyer be employed in Court to\r\nmake it more convincing and exculpatory? A statement must be based on\r\nfacts, and these facts become material only when proved. On what\r\nrational grounds can, therefore, a statement permitted and yet the\r\nmaterial evidence supporting it disallowed? It is no answer to say that\r\nthe statement is meant for the guidance of the _Swaraj_ Courts when the\r\nsame are established, for when that eventuality happens, a statement\r\nsupported by evidence will be any a better help to these Swaraj Courts\r\nthan a mere statement? It is obvious that no Swaraj Court will liberate\r\na man merely on his own statement, without further inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil Disobedience\r\n\r\nWe are on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi undertaking an important part of his\r\nprogramme by starting Civil Disobedience in a district in Surat. It is\r\nvery difficult to offer any useful comment on this undertaking because\r\nbeyond the general lines, his programme in its detail is not yet before\r\nthe Country. We can only hope that the resistance to law will not be so\r\nundertaken as to be widely interpreted as a sort of charter for general\r\nlawlessness. That would be a catastrophe for which the country is not\r\nprepared. This seems also to be Mr. Gandhi's opinion, for he has very\r\nprudently circumscribed the practice of the resistance with very severe\r\nrestrictions, involving a moral and economic preparation. To disobey\r\nspecific orders of Government or their officials, which have no moral\r\nsanction behind them or are illegal in their inception, is a\r\ncomparatively easy matter, fraught with no far-reaching harm to the\r\ncommunity. The disobedience, in such a case commands the moral approval\r\nof the civilised community, and ends only by affecting the prestige of\r\nthe promulgator of the order. But when a campaign is undertaken\r\ninvolving a wholesale and general defiance of order and authority,\r\nforces may arise, which, in the hands of inexperienced and enthusiastic\r\nassociates or partisans, may reach extreme limits, involving the\r\ncommunity in chaos, disorder and possibly violence. The country has had\r\nonly a year's training in his (Mr. Gandhi) counsels of non-violent\r\nresistance--far too short a period for his countrymen to imbibe his\r\nspirit, in a manner worthy of his teaching. May we, therefore, hope that\r\nin launching on this undertaking he will seriously consider this aspect\r\nof the case? We shall of course, watch his experiment but with concern\r\nand solicitude, feeling secure in the hope, created by his magnificent\r\npersonality, that in his hands the destinies of the country are\r\nperfectly safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII\r\n\r\nExtracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt\r\nButler, Governor of the U. P. of Agra & Oudh, at the opening of the U. P.\r\nLegislative Council,\r\n\r\n_Lucknow, 22nd January, 1921_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,\r\n\r\n\"Great efforts have been made to draw away young men from schools and\r\ncolleges and to induce professional men to give up their careers. Great\r\nefforts have been made to prevent voters from going to the polls. But\r\nthese efforts have met with little success. The elections have\r\nundoubtedly given the province a really representative legislative\r\ncouncil. The chief opponents of the reforms have shown by word and act\r\nthat their aim is not the ordered development of political institutions\r\nin India but the expulsions of Western civilization from India--a course\r\ninvolving the reversion to the condition of disorder, lawlessness and\r\ninternecine strife such as prevailed in the unsettled times before the\r\nadvent of British rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tenantry were widely stirred up. The criminal classes took\r\nadvantage of the occasion and serious trouble ensued in which there was\r\nregrettable loss of life. A full report on the Rae Bareli disturbances\r\nwill be published within a few days. It was fortunately possible to\r\nrestore order without calling in military aid from outside, and for this\r\nI have already congratulated the local authorities and others concerned.\r\nStatements, I may say that all reports from both Rae Bareli and Fyzabad\r\nindicate that the tenantry are actuated by no hostility to Government or\r\nto Europeans. The agitators have endeavoured to stir up such hostility.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for my Government I have chosen as colleagues without favour strong\r\nand independent men. They will have my complete confidence in all\r\nmatters, and it is my desire that we should work together as far as\r\npossible as one Government. I shall endeavour to secure that we all,\r\nEuropeans and Indians, work together on harmonious lines as\r\nbrother-subjects of the King-Emperor; and I pray that the Reforms Scheme\r\nwhich we are commencing to-day will and largely and effectively to the\r\nwell-being and happiness of this ancient land of Hindustan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\nExtracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler\r\nat a meeting of the United Provinces Legislative Council\r\n\r\n_28th March 1921_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,\r\n\r\n\"The recent disorder in Rae Bareli has necessitated a further\r\nreconsideration of the question. Whereas the former disorders in Rae\r\nBareli were largely agrarian in origin the recent disorders were mainly\r\npolitical in origin and wholly revolutionary\".\r\n\r\n\"The result of the disorders has been an unfortunate loss of life, for\r\nwhich the agitators are directly responsible, and a feeling of\r\ninsecurity which if unchecked may spread with untoward results,\r\naffecting innocent and guilty alike. Confronted with an elemental\r\nquestion as to the maintenance of order, my Government came unanimously\r\nto the conclusion that it was necessary to stop the campaign of\r\nunconstitutional agitation and lying, _propaganda_ which has been\r\ncarried on the four south-eastern districts of Outh--Rae Bareli,\r\nPartabgarh, Sultanpur and Fyzabad. We therefore applied to the\r\nGovernment of India to extend the Seditious Meetings Act to those four\r\ndistricts. This has been done\".\r\n\r\n\"I believe that this action will have the support of this Council and of\r\nresponsible people generally in this province. With the non-co-operators\r\nwe can have nothing to do beyond meeting their mischievous activities.\r\nTheir movement is a revolutionary movement playing on passion and\r\npandering to ignorance but the mass of people are loyal and all their\r\ninterests are bound up with the maintenance of order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\nExtracts from the speech by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler at a\r\nDurbar held at Lucknow\r\n\r\n_17th December 1921_\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI am glad to have this opportunity of meeting you to-day, in formal\r\nassembly, and to outline to you the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nMy Government was accused some months ago of being repressive. I have\r\nmet that charge completely with facts and figures and proved that the\r\nGovernment has acted with due patience in spite of deliberate and\r\nrepeated provocation. It has dealt with agitation under the ordinary law\r\nand has maintained order and security with reasonable success. Of late\r\nthe agitators, whose openly avowed object is to make Government\r\nimpossible, have entered on a campaign of increased activity. Quite\r\nrecently the Government received reports from several quarters\r\nforeshadowing lawlessness and disorder. The Collector of Meerut reported\r\nthat civil disobedience had been openly preached at the District\r\nCongress at Garhmukhtesar, that cloth shops were picketed, that\r\nagitation was plainly on the increase, and that everything looked like\r\nworking up to a climax at an early date. The Commissioner of Fyzabad\r\nreported that the situation was menacing in the Bara Banki district\r\nwhere the Deputy Commissioner could not appear without being hooted and\r\nthe loyal section of population were frightened and disheartened. A\r\nspeech was delivered in which the audience was asked by a political\r\nfanatic whether they would agree to murder the Deputy Commissioner and\r\nthey replied with one voice that they would. The Commissioner also\r\nreported that things were menacing in the Tanda sub-division of the\r\nFyzabad district. At Gonda regular volunteer corps had been instituted\r\nwith officers. From Cawnpore and Etawah reports came of a recrudescence\r\nof criminal intimidation. In Ballia the people were asked to prepare\r\nthemselves for killing and being killed. Alarming reports were also\r\nreceived from Saharanpur, Aligarh and Gorakhpur.\r\n\r\nNow all these reports reached the Government within three or four days.\r\nIt was quite clear that we were on the verge of serious and widespread\r\ntrouble. The Government decided, and decided unanimously, to apply the\r\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1908, part II, to the whole province at\r\nonce and to issue instructions to Commissioners and District Officers to\r\ntake all measures under the law necessary for the preservation of order\r\nand protection of loyal and peaceful citizens. This was followed by an\r\nopen defiance to the Government signed by over seventy individuals in\r\nthe _Independent_ newspaper. As you are aware the ringleaders have been\r\narrested. I do not propose to deal with individual cases; some of them\r\nare still under trial. I will only say this, that all the reports I have\r\nreceived from different parts of the province show that the action taken\r\nhas had excellent result and has restored confidence to loyal and\r\npeaceful people. Indeed, there is a feeling of general relief. The\r\nCommissioner of Fyazabad reports \"There has been a great improvement\r\nsince I last wrote. The police who had resigned are now applying to be\r\ntaken back.\" The Commissioner of Agra writes \"The present Government\r\npolicy appears to be generally welcomed.\" The Commissioner of Gorakhpur\r\nsays \"There is no doubt that the moderate party not only welcome the\r\narrests but in some cases are jubilant over them.\" The Commissioner of\r\nMeerut reports that the action taken had \"been hailed by all loyal\r\npersons with the greatest relief.\" He adds \"our friends and the much\r\nharried police are in much better hearts and non-co-operator is no\r\nlonger looked upon with dread by them.\" The Commissioner of Lucknow\r\nattributes the settling down of the Hindu population and especially the\r\ncultivating classes largely to the recent action of Government. A\r\nre-assuring report has come from Aligarh. The situation is still\r\ncritical; but, I think, that it is well in hand, and I am convinced that\r\nif a policy of firmness is pursued and pursued steadily for some time we\r\nmay reasonably hope to break the back of a conspiracy which openly avows\r\nits intention of trying to do away with Government and openly defies the\r\nlaw of the land.\r\n\r\nConsider the position, gentlemen; What have the Congress and _Khilafat_\r\nmovements done? _Satyagraha_, which Mr. Gandhi himself pronounced to be\r\na \"Himalayan blunder\" ended in disgrace. The attempt to boycott colleges\r\nand schools failed signally. It did not affect in this province one per\r\ncent of the students and scholars. The attempt to boycott the law courts\r\nwas wholly unsuccessful. The appeal to surrender titles given by and\r\noffices held under the Government fell on deaf ears. The efforts to\r\nseduce soldiers and policemen were almost in vain. But with each\r\nsuccessive failure, they have sown wider the seeds of racial hatred and\r\nthe spirit of lawlessness. The results cry out against them and their\r\nwork. Their hands are dripping with innocent blood; and the cries of\r\nruined homes and ravished women have gone up to heaven. This is the end\r\nof the idea of self-Government attained by non-violent revolution, an\r\nidea wholly fantastic and chimerical.\r\n\r\nAs is usual when Government takes vigorous action, there is a body of\r\ncritics who have no experience or sense of government and who are\r\nfrightened by action. They seem to think that law and order keep\r\nthemselves. The truth is far otherwise. Law and order are mainly kept by\r\nforce, and that with difficulty. They are very easily upset. You have\r\nhad experience of disorder in southern Oudh, in which there was an orgy\r\nof violence, rape, rapine and arson. I do not hesitate to tell you that\r\nif the Government trifled with the present situation you would probably\r\nsoon find your lives, your property and your honour in danger. The\r\nobjection that action has been taken with warning is quite unfounded.\r\nMore than once I have publicly declared that this Government would not\r\ntolerate disorder or intimidation. The aggressors are those who violate\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX X\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT BY SIR L. PORTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been vilified bitterly, every kind of abuse has been showered on\r\nus by non-co-operators, every form of insidious agitation has been\r\ntried, and we have stayed our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nViolent Agitators\r\n\r\nI will mention the case of one of the men who has now been arrested and\r\nis undergoing imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant. He made at\r\nleast ten speeches up and down the country which our legal advisers\r\ninformed us were clearly actionable. I allude to Mr. Jawahir Lal Nebru.\r\nHis final effort was a speech, somewhere in the west of the Province, in\r\nwhich he quoted word by word the sedition section, _i.e._, the promotion,\r\nof disaffection against the Government as by law established and the\r\nsection which deals with promoting hatred between classes of His\r\nMajesty's subjects, and he said that the object of his life was to carry\r\nout this promotion of sedition and disaffection. Still we did nothing.\r\nYou may well ask why. We thought that the forces of reason and sobriety\r\nwould re-establish their sway. We hoped that the great body of moderate\r\nopinion of the Provinces would be sufficiently powerful to assuage this\r\nmovement and to stop the dissemination of poison. We were wrong. So far\r\nfrom losing any strength I do not hesitate to say that the movement has\r\ngone on gaining strength. Then came the time in November when we were\r\nconfronted with reports from our trusted officers all over the provinces\r\nwhich left no doubt whatever in our minds that the situation had very\r\ngreatly developed, and that there was imminent possibility (I would go\r\nfurther and say probability) of an outburst of violence in more than one\r\ndistrict. I have here a big folio of reports. It is quite impossible for\r\nme in debate like this to quote them all. There are copies of reports\r\nfrom districts as wide apart and representative as Meerut, Cawnpur,\r\nFyzabad, Etawah, Balia, Barabanki and the peaceful district of Aligarh,\r\nwhich, according to its member, Thakur Manak Singh, is now the scene of\r\nthis campaign of repression. I should like, as a typical instance, to\r\nread out the description of the procedure which was adopted in the\r\nBarabanki district. The Barabanki district, as my friend on my right\r\nwill bear me out, is a particularly difficult one. It is full of a class\r\nwhom religious fanaticism particularly affects and when it once gets out\r\nof hand it is very difficult to deal with. I remember when I first came\r\nto India, there was tremendous outbreak of dacoity and violent crime in\r\nthat and adjacent districts, which it took months to put down, at the\r\ncost of immense suffering to the population. This is one of the\r\ndistricts, which was selected as a focus in work on by these (what\r\nshould I call them?) advocates of soul force.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoul Force\r\n\r\nTheir main activities were directed to stirring up religious fanaticism.\r\nIn mosques, in bazars mendacious stories were told regarding the\r\nbombardment and desecration of the Sacred Places of Islam. They were\r\ntold that Hindu and Mahomedan women had been outraged and that medicines\r\nissued from dispensaries were mixed with wine and that the fat of cows\r\nand pigs was used in the manufacture of cloth. There was boycott and\r\nintimidation to prevent foreign cloth sellers from importing any more\r\ncloth, and to force them to sign a pledge not to do so. This went on\r\nuntil November and the beginning of December when the picketing of\r\nschools started. That is a typical report from a district which takes\r\nvery little to set it ablaze. What has recently happened there you have\r\nalready read in the papers. There are many other instances which strike\r\nme, but there is one typical instance from Etawah. There is a fair which\r\nhas been held there for many years. It was picketed. People were\r\nprevented from coming in by open intimidation and finally attempts were\r\nmade to blacken the face of a Maulvi on his way to the Islamia High\r\nSchool, of which he is manager. I can multiply these instances, and, if\r\nany member of the Council wishes to know the representations which were\r\nreceived from these districts, I am perfectly willing to let him see the\r\nreports in order that he may satisfy himself as to what the real\r\ncondition was.\r\n\r\nPandit Radha Kant Malviya: Will the Hon. Member read the report from\r\nAllahabad.\r\n\r\nSir Ludovic Porter: We had a report from the Commissioner of Allahabad,\r\non whose judgment I place great reliance, just before we enforced this\r\nAct. He expressed his reasoned opinion that if we allowed matters to\r\ndrift any further, there would be a widespread disaster. He also stated\r\nthat from information he had received, the whole camp of non-co-operators,\r\nin Allahabad were particularly cheerful with regard to the outlook, and\r\nthey thought great developments in their favour were shortly going to\r\ntake place. Well that was our position. As to the nature of this\r\nnon-violent non-co-operation, we had no delusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal Intimidation\r\n\r\nWe know that criminal intimidation had been practised on the widest\r\nscale in many districts. I may say that the majority of districts where\r\nthese associations existed, criminal intimidation of a subtle kind,\r\nnamely to attack a man in his religious opinions or to attack him in his\r\nsocial relations, had been widely practised. We had an example here in\r\nLucknow of ordinary intimidation. A member of the Council himself\r\nwitnessed the unfortunate driver of an ekka being dragged off his ekka\r\nand beaten because he ventured to ply for hire on the 17th of November.\r\n\r\nI know myself the case of a shop which was kept open for two or three\r\ndays. The shopkeeper was surrounded by a howling mob, and he was told\r\nwhat would happen to him, if he did not shut up his shop. In Fatehpur\r\nthey kept a blackboard, which was exhibited publicly, to show up the\r\npeople, who ventured to buy foreign cloth. This is also a form of subtle\r\nand most cruel intimidation involving social boycott. You all know\r\nperfectly well the difficulties that exist in India in getting victims\r\nof this kind of tyranny to come forward and seek their legal redress in\r\nthe ordinary courts of law. The difficulty of proving criminal\r\nintimidation is accentuated by the fact that it is not cognizable by the\r\npolice, and, consequently the complainant has to go to court, but, owing\r\nto the difficulty of getting witnesses to prove his case, he usually\r\ncompromises. Well that is the position which confronted us. There was a\r\nsystem of widespread intimidation. So far from the movement being on the\r\nverge of collapse, as certain optimists stated to-day, it was increasing\r\nin vigour. There was the usual lip service of non-violence, a profession\r\nwhich in me produces a feeling of nausea. Practice and precept, as we\r\nsaid in a letter to the Government of India, which they quoted in the\r\ndebate \"were poles as under.\" There were also, as my friend Kunwar\r\nJagdish Parshad in his eloquent speech this morning has stated, constant\r\nendeavours to seduce Government servants from their duty. A great deal\r\nof pity has been showered on the non-co-operators by certain speakers\r\nto-day, but they never spared a moment to think what the police have\r\ngone through. Here in Lucknow Chauk, sub-inspectors and the rank and\r\nfile of your own fellow countrymen have been grossly insulted, abused\r\nand their family life rendered intolerable. Are we not going to support\r\nthem when such facts are brought to our notice? We are bound to support\r\nour loyal servants, who, through all these troubles, have served us\r\nfaithfully. I am only asking for some recognition of the difficulty to\r\nwhich they are exposed in performing their duties, and in their daily\r\nlife. With these facts before us we came to the conclusion--the\r\nGovernment as a whole came to the conclusion--that the Criminal Law\r\nAmendment should be extended to these Provinces. I think there can be no\r\ndoubt that the whole Council are unanimous that law and order must be\r\nenforced. They may differ from us as to the method which we took.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arrests\r\n\r\nI now come to the arrests which followed. The great majority of arrests\r\nwere effected by the local authorities under the powers delegated to\r\nthem. In one instance only so far as my memory serves, the\r\nGovernor-in-Council issued orders for certain arrests, and that was for\r\nthe leaders of Allahabad and Lucknow. What are the facts in regard to\r\nthese particular arrests? These associations had been declared to be\r\nillegal. Immediately after their proclamation a manifesto was published\r\non the 6th December with a pledge which was signed by 75 persons, I will\r\nread the terms of that manifesto. \"Having read and thoroughly understood\r\nthe Government notification, etc., and knowing full well the\r\nconsequences of not obeying them, we, etc., hereby pledge ourselves\r\ncivilly to disobey without any objection all such Government orders and\r\nlaws as may be determined from time to time by the Provincial Congress\r\nCommittee, or by a committee appointed by or in this behalf. We further\r\npledge ourselves to obey, in utter disregard of the consequences, all\r\norders of the volunteer corps relating to such disobedience.\" Now\r\ngentlemen, what does that mean? It means that at the bidding of an\r\nirresponsible autocrat in Bombay, the members of this association\r\npledged themselves blindly to disobey any law of the land. If that is\r\nnot the essence of anarchy I do not know what is. We were told this\r\nmorning in the very moderate speech of my friend Mr. Zafar Husain, that\r\nhe did not think that this Act was enacted with a view to the present\r\njuncture. Of course it was not. Nobody could forsee this madness which\r\nhas come over India during the last two years. It was enacted to meet an\r\noutbreak of anarchy in Bengal. Could there be anything worse than the\r\npresent position, that a body of men numbering thousands, totally\r\nirresponsible, very many of them now of a dangerous character, (not at\r\nfirst, but they are steadily deteriorating) pledge themselves to disobey\r\nany law when they were asked to do so by a gentlemen in Bombay, for this\r\nis what this pledge means? How could any Government carry on, that would\r\nnot accept that challenge? In consequence of this, we issued orders for\r\nthe arrest and production of a certain number, not all, of the leaders.\r\nIn doing so we have now the support and authority of the Government of\r\nIndia. The Government has informed us that they agree with us in holding\r\nthat the persons who deliberately organise associations, avowedly\r\nintended to break the law, or associations the members of which are\r\npledged blindly to disobey any laws, are liable to criminal prosecution.\r\nFollowing on that came the meeting at Allahabad, at which the\r\nSuperintendent of Police, who had been deputed to execute a search\r\nwarrant, was present. This meeting deliberately reaffirmed this pledge\r\nin his presence. Now, I think if we analyse the objections that have\r\nbeen taken to the prosecutions they very largely centre round those\r\npersons, the leaders and members of this meeting, who have been\r\nprosecuted and convicted. In all they number, I, think, something like\r\n100. I have stated the facts, and I accept the responsibility. I see no\r\nother way out. As long as any Government exists they have to deal with\r\nmen who offer a challenge like that, in the method in which we did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XI\r\n\r\nBARABANKI DISORDERS\r\n\r\n_Lucknow, 18th January_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a view of the various rumours that were current regarding the\r\nsituation at Barabanki....\r\n\r\nA lengthy official communique has just now been issued based on the\r\nreport of the Deputy Commissioner....\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with effect from the 23rd November 1921 the Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act was applied to the Province. Its immediate effect was\r\ngood, and several volunteers who had been parading in uniform doffed\r\ntheir sashes and were disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nKhilafat Agitators\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, Khilafat agitators, who had publicly announced\r\nin the press of the 18th November that Barabanki Tahsil was being\r\nprepared for civil disobedience by the end of November, considered this\r\nact a suitable one to infringe. They redoubled their efforts and\r\ncollected considerable sums, mainly for the Angora Fund, both through\r\nmembers of the 46 Khilafat committees established in this district and\r\nby itinery volunteers, who were paid for their services, either by fixed\r\nmonthly salaries or by a percentage on collections. Between the 19th and\r\n24th December, four volunteers were arrested under Section 7 (1) and 17\r\n(2) of the Act, and these arrests were reported to have had a temporary\r\nbeneficial effect. By the 3rd January, when the District delegates\r\nreturned from the Ahmedabad conference, the leaders decided to take\r\naction openly. On the 4th it was reported to me that large numbers of\r\nvolunteers would march into the city under the command of their zemindar\r\nleaders. No precise information however, could be obtained as to their\r\nintentions. On the morning of the 7th January batches of volunteers\r\nbegan to issue chiefly from the Congress Office from which was hung a\r\nKhilafat flag and a large notice calling on people to enlist as\r\nvolunteers. These volunteers were mostly from outside villages and were\r\nheaded by petty zemindars. They were all Mahomedans and had been worked\r\nup to a high pitch of religious enthusiasm. Many of them had their\r\nQurans slung round their necks. They had apparently been incited to a\r\nstate bordering on religious frenzy by exhortations from their leaders,\r\nthat their religion was being destroyed by the British Government. They\r\nwere wild in their abuse of Government, officials and specially the\r\nPolice. The whole religious street in front of the Congress office\r\nresounded with religious shouts and cries of \"Victory to Islam\". The cry\r\nof \"Allah ho Akbar\" was uttered as a war cry with fanatical zeal,\r\nspecially when any arrests were made.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arrests\r\n\r\nI had deputed Mr. Colton, Superintendent of Police, and Babu\r\nAmbikanandan Singh, Sub-Divisional Officer to take up a position\r\nopposite the Congress office and to arrest the ring leaders and the most\r\ntruculent of the volunteers as it did not appear to be safe to allow\r\nthem to remain at large, specially as fresh volunteers continued to pour\r\ninto the city. Those selected were marched down under an escort to the\r\nJail....\r\n\r\nThe procession was accompanied by noisy music and the usual shouts of\r\nnon-co-operation were raised. He (Chaudhari Athar Ali) refused to go\r\nbefore the Deputy Magistrate as requested but mounting the steps of the\r\nCongress office delivered a speech. After reciting certain words from\r\nthe Qoran he addressed the crowd, and in a loud voice, declared that\r\nthis tyrannical Government or tyrannical race (both versions are given)\r\nshould be destroyed. The crowd, which was in a state of fanatical\r\nfrenzy, replied, \"_Amin_, it will be destroyed immediately\". He exhorted\r\nthe crowd to \"become volunteers, enrol volunteers and fill the\r\njails--victory to Islam\". The cry was taken up by the crowd. Seeing that\r\nthe speech was causing great excitement, the Deputy Magistrate directed\r\nthe police to produce him before him. He refused to go to the jail in\r\nthe _Ekka_ provided by the Deputy Magistrate, but insisted on going on\r\nfoot, taking a circuitous route at the head of the procession of 500 or\r\n1,000 men. He stopped the procession at various places and at these\r\nhalts the usual _jais_ were raised. The police were abused and\r\nGovernment servants were called dogs and pigs. On this day ten\r\nvolunteers were arrested. On this date also there was the same commotion\r\nin the city, but the number of volunteers decreased.\r\n\r\nThroughout the four days the volunteers created disturbances. It was\r\nobvious that the movement was entirely a Mahomedan one. Not a single\r\nHindu volunteer appeared. The Mahomedan volunteers and the crowd which\r\ncheered them on were filled with religious enthusiasm and hatred of the\r\nBritish Government. The intention of their leaders apparently, was to\r\nprovoke the Police to acts of violence against them, and also to prove\r\nthat they could insult the Government official with impunity, and were\r\nnot afraid to go to jail. The following remark made in jail by Nawab\r\nAli, an ex-vakil, a few minutes after his sentence, in the presence of\r\ntwo magistrates and a large number of pleaders, is significant. \"By\r\nimprisonment people would get accustomed to the horrors of jail. By\r\nshooting they would learn to bare their breasts to rifle shots and\r\nbayonets. Men ready to be shot should now be enlisted.\" The accused have\r\nbeen convicted.--_The Pioneer January 20, 1922._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XII\r\n\r\nTHE GORAKHPUR TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n_Gorakhpur, 7th February_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom early morning on Saturday a large number of volunteers were noticed\r\narriving at Chauri Chaura and collecting on the Gorakhpur side of the\r\nrailway station. They then proceeded towards the Bhapa Bazar, and formed\r\na procession. They said that they were going to picket the bazar, and\r\nthey proceeded towards the bazar through the police station grounds,\r\nalthough this was not their direct route. The procession consisted\r\nroughly of 3,000 people, and was headed by four or five volunteers in\r\nkhaddar uniform. Some of them had swaraj flags in their hands. After the\r\nmain body of the procession had gone on, there were a few stragglers\r\nwith whom the police, it is alleged, had some interchange of remarks. It\r\nis also stated that one or two of the stragglers were hustled by some of\r\nthe chowkidars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mob breaks Loose\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say exactly what happened next but at any rate the\r\nstragglers shouted out and main procession came back and started\r\nthrowing kanker at the Police. For some time the attack was confined to\r\nvicious kanker throwing, in which thousands of volunteers were engaged.\r\nThe sub-inspector, finding that the affair was taking a more serious\r\nturn, asked the rioters to desist, but they would not take any heed, and\r\nattacked the police with lathies. The sub-inspector, in order to\r\nfrighten the mob, fired a few shots in the air. This infuriated the mob,\r\nwho made a rush towards the thana with lathies and spears. A few\r\npolicemen were knocked down, and the remainder of the police went inside\r\nthe thana buildings for protection. One or two policemen must have fired\r\non the mob in earnest, as some of the rioters had received gunshot\r\nwounds, but whether the firing took place before the rush or after it is\r\nnot known yet. By this time several of the policemen had been killed\r\noutside the police buildings, and one party fetched oil and straw and\r\nset fire to the thana at various points. This drove the entire police\r\nforce out of the buildings.\r\n\r\nThey were immediately set upon by the mob and done to death in the most\r\nbrutal manner. Their heads were battered with hinges torn from the doors\r\nof the thana, and then the bodies were soaked in oil and burnt. The\r\ncharred remains were recovered, some in front of the thana, others in\r\nthe thana compound and one at the back of the thana. Some of the armed\r\npolicemen had obviously been battered to death by their own muskets.\r\nThere was a certain amount of money in the thana and it is suspected\r\nthat the rioters, having killed the policemen, looted the thana and then\r\nset fire to the buildings. The sub-Inspector's family quarters, it is\r\nbelieved, were also looted, and cash and jewellery were removed, but the\r\ninmates were not interfered with. The family quarters also bear marks of\r\nviolence. The windows have been removed, and there are wide apertures in\r\nthe roof. After having completely destroyed the police station the\r\nrioters dismantled the railway line in two places, and cut the telegraph\r\nwires. They threatened to kill the railway station master and the post\r\nmaster of Chauri Chaura if they sent any messages to the authorities at\r\nGorakhpur. In all 22 policemen, including two Sub Inspectors, one head\r\nconstable, 15 constables, four chowkidars and a servant of the\r\nSub-Inspector were killed. Among the dead were found two of the rioters.\r\nA constable, and a chowkidar, who were at the police station during the\r\nattack escaped, and these men have been traced, and it is believed that\r\ntheir statement will throw considerable light on the whole affair.\r\nComplete quiet has now been restored. The Commissioner, the Magistrate\r\nand the Superintendent of Police visited the scene immediately on\r\nreceipt of information, and restored confidence among the village people\r\nand the railway and telegraph lines were quickly repaired. Mr. Sands,\r\nthe Deputy Inspector General of Police, attended the funeral of the dead\r\npolicemen. The authorities immediately after the incident, invited three\r\nprominent gentlemen of Gorakhpur, one of whom is a non-co-operator, to\r\nvisit the scene of the tragedy.--_The Pioneer February 9, 1922._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIII\r\n\r\nBENGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's Day Dinner, on 30th November\r\n1920\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nAmong other things non-co-operation is to achieve is swaraj in one year.\r\nMr. Gandhi has said so himself. The question is--do the people of Bengal\r\nwant this particular form of swaraj? Being a shrewd and intelligent\r\npeople they will doubtless wish to satisfy themselves first of all as to\r\nwhat precisely this swaraj is. Fortunately we are able to answer that\r\nquestion with authority, because Mr. Gandhi had issued a very clear\r\nexplanation of what he means by swaraj in a small manual entitled\r\n'Indian Home Rule', a new edition of which was published by Messrs.\r\nGanesh & Co., of Madras, last year. I earnestly commend a perusal of it\r\nto all who are interested in the future of the land we live in....\r\n\r\nVery well, if this is the sort of thing that people want by all means\r\nlet them adopt non-co-operation. But I do not believe for a moment that\r\nthis is what people want. And that, no doubt, is why we find so many\r\nother reasons advanced for adopting non-co-operation. It is claimed for\r\nit for example, that it is a saintly weapon in the hands of an oppressed\r\npeople engaged in a righteous struggle against a tyrannous and\r\nunrighteous Government. Let us examine its credentials so that we may\r\nsee to what extent the claim to righteousness can be sustained. In its\r\nearliest phase, when it was known as _Satyagraha_, its result were\r\nadmittedly evil. The Hunter Committee was unanimous in its opinion that\r\nits effect was to engender \"a familiarity and sympathy with disobedience\r\nto laws\" and \"to undermine the law abiding instincts which stand between\r\nsociety and outbreaks of violence at a time when their full strength was\r\nrequired.\" And, indeed, Mr. Gandhi himself confessed himself sorry that\r\nwhen he embarked upon a mass movement \"he under-rated the forces of\r\nevil, and that he was obliged to pause and consider how best to meet the\r\nsituation.\" Then again another object of the non-co-operators is to\r\nre-impose Turkish Administration upon the non-Turkish peoples who have\r\nso long suffered under it. The fact that under Turkish administration\r\ncalculated attempts have been made to exterminate the Armenian\r\npeople--one of the most horrible chapters in the whole history of\r\ncrime--is ignored, a matter for surprise, surely, in view of the innate\r\nabhorrence of violence professed by the originator of the movement.\r\nIndeed, any one making a comprehensive survey of the non-co-operation\r\nmovement could scarcely be blamed if he came to the conclusion that the\r\nonly password required to give admission to the non-co-operation camp\r\nwas \"race-hatred.\" And is Bengal going to tolerate a movement based upon\r\nhatred, and, therefore, rooted in evil? Surely the world has had its\r\nfill of hatred. Cast your eyes over the past six years, and what do you\r\nsee? A world in agony. The peoples of this earth trailing their spectral\r\nway across a blood-soaked scene of destruction and desolation--a ghastly\r\nphantasmagoria of human suffering; a hideous calvary. Humanity in\r\ntorment, scourged with sorrow, losing its hold upon hope, drifting\r\nderelict in a terrifying ocean of despair. That is what hatred has done\r\nfor mankind. And is mankind going to tolerate those who would\r\ndeliberately and of malice aforethought perpetuate this grisly tradition\r\nof hatred among men? Let us have the answer of the people of this\r\ncountry to that question. For myself I have faith in the better mind of\r\nthe people of Bengal. Not for nothing did Job Charnock lay the\r\nfoundations of this great city. The finger of destiny was even then\r\ntracing the future of Great Britain and India upon the rock of doom. For\r\nbetter or for worse our paths lie side by side. The policy of Great\r\nBritain has been fairly and frankly stated. We are inviting the people\r\nof India to co-operate with us in making and travelling over that road\r\nwhich will lead to an India fashioned in so far as its internal affairs\r\nare concerned in ever-increasing accordance with the genius of its\r\npeoples, and filling a position of ever increasing pride and honour in\r\nthe great confederation of the British Empire. Can any one who has faith\r\nin the existence of an eternal and immutable principle of justice and\r\nright doubt what the final choice of the people of India will be? Surely\r\nnot. And it is with an unshakeable faith in its future that I give you\r\nthe toast of \"The Land We Live in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's Dinner, on 30th November 1921\r\n\r\nIndia to-day is honoured by another distinguished guest--the most\r\ndistinguished, indeed save only one, whom the citizens of the British\r\nEmpire could welcome, namely, the heir to the Empire's Throne--His Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales. He has come with words of sympathy upon\r\nhis lips and with feelings of affection in his heart for the \"Land we\r\nlive in.\" Can it be doubted, then that from all communities and all\r\ncreeds he will receive a royal welcome? I confess that it was with\r\namazement that I learned that there was a small section of people, in\r\nthis land of all lands, who had so far forgotten the dictates of\r\ncourtesy as to urge the boycott of the Royal visitor. The promoters of\r\nthis movement claim, I believe, to represent the fine flower of the\r\nancient culture and civilisation of India. Well one lives and learns. I\r\nhad always been brought up to believe that courtesy towards a guest was\r\na deep-rooted tradition with the Indian people. And so I still believe\r\nit to be, though there may be some who have forgotten it. I do not\r\nbelieve that this attitude represents the real mind of India. Indeed, I\r\nknow that it does not--for it was an Indian gentleman whose patriotism\r\nis beyond all possible question, who said to me when he read of the\r\nproposal \"now must we bow our heads in shame for in showing rudeness to\r\na guest we have touched the lowest depths of national humiliation and\r\ndegradation.\" That, I believe, represents the best and, indeed, the real\r\nmind of India, for in India it has always been realised that discourtesy\r\ninjures those who are guilty of it rather than those against whom it is\r\npractised, for it lowers them in the eyes of all right thinking men and\r\nindeed is sooner or later found by the man who is guilty of it to be a\r\nwound gnawing at his own self-respect...\r\n\r\nAlready long strides have been taken along the path towards the ultimate\r\ngoal. Indian and European have come closer together--mutual\r\nunderstanding and goodwill are springing up between them. How much more\r\ncould be achieved in this direction were it not for the black cloud of\r\nanger and hatred which has been brought into being by the apostles of\r\nrevolution. From my experience of the past 12 months I have no\r\nhesitation in saying that a wonderful new era would have dawned for\r\nIndia already, had it not been for the wild passions which have been let\r\nloose upon the land by those who have pinned their faith to revolution.\r\n\r\nThey call the Government \"Satanic\". Have they then a monopoly of\r\nrighteousness? The wild lawlessness and bloodshed at Giridih, Malegaon,\r\nAlighar, Malabar, Bombay and many other places--do these things not\r\nsavour of the work of Satan? These are, indeed, but the heralds of red\r\nrevolution. Let them look deep into their hearts and ask themselves in\r\nall seriousness if the salvation of India lies along such lines....\r\n\r\nHis Excellency replying to the deputation of the representation of the\r\npeople in the mufassal, held in Government House Calcutta on 2nd July\r\n1921, said:--\r\n\r\nLet me, therefore, repeat what I said a year ago. The facts are these:\r\nThe Turkish troops in the fort at Mecca, in their attempts to overcome\r\nthe Arabs who had rallied round the Sheriff bombarded the mosque\r\ncontaining the Kaaba. One of the Turkish shells actually struck the\r\nKaaba, burned a hole in the holy carpet and killed nine persons who were\r\nkneeling in prayer. These are the facts. The outrage was committed by\r\nthe Turks, and I solemnly and categorically affirm that the British had\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with it. This being so, can you or any one\r\nsuggest any other motive for the propagation of such falsehoods except\r\nthe desire to create hatred against the British?...\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's speech at the Legislative Council on 19th December 1921\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI will not go further back than October last. At the beginning of that\r\nmonth a manifesto, signed by Mr. Gandhi and a large number of other\r\nprominent non-co-operators, laid it down that it was the duty of every\r\nIndian soldier and Civilian to sever his connection with Government.\r\nThere followed two important developments--an intensive campaign to\r\nundermine the loyalty of the police and a rapid development in the\r\nactivities of \"volunteer\" corps. Alongside of these two significant\r\ndevelopments was to be observed a rapid increase in open lawlessness and\r\ndefiance of constituted authority. There were breaches of the peace in\r\nHowrah and Calcutta which are within the recollection of all. But such\r\nepisodes were not confined to Calcutta. All over the Presidency persons\r\nwere moving, stirring up dissatisfaction among the masses. This process\r\nwas assisted by an intensive campaign of highly inflammatory speeches\r\nwhich had been in progress for some months past. Between the beginning\r\nof June and the middle of November, I received reports of no less than\r\n4,265 meetings held in different parts of the province. I could quote\r\npassages from these speeches which are so inflammatory, so violent in\r\ntheir abuse that they would shock the Council. I refrain from doing so\r\nfor the sole reason that I do not want to excite feeling unnecessarily.\r\nBut I can assure the Council that, addressed, as in nine cases out of\r\nten these speeches have been, to audiences made up of the illiterate and\r\nemotional masses, they could have but one result, namely that of\r\nspreading broadcast feelings of hatred and disaffection and of goading\r\nthe people to violence. And that, indeed, has already been the actual\r\nresult. Assaults on Settlement Officers have taken place. Government\r\nservants have been threatened and boycotted. Now let me return to\r\nCalcutta; and I take the events of November 17th to illustrate the state\r\nof affairs which had been reached. The life of city was paralysed. Were\r\nthe police provocative? Certainly not. On the contrary the almost\r\nuniversal complaint made to me was that the police remained inactive and\r\nrefrained from making arrests....\r\n\r\nI have now to inform the Council of the discovery on the night of\r\nDecember 8th of a number of sinister weapons concealed in an untenanted\r\nhouse in the heart of the town. The nature of these weapons left little\r\ndoubt as to the sort of use to which they were intended to be\r\nput--swords ingeniously concealed in the handles of umbrellas, daggers\r\nof a peculiarly vicious type, tulwars and jars of acid. Very well, then\r\nI would lay stress upon this--that with so many recent outbreaks of\r\nrioting in the streets of the city fresh in one's mind, and with these\r\nfurther evidences of the sort of activities which were in progress at\r\nthe movement, it was not unreasonable as a precautionary measure to have\r\nrecourse to a limited number of military patrols.\r\n\r\nOnly three days ago an Urdu manuscript leaflet was found posted up in\r\nthe city of which the following is a translation:--\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about only? Just come face to face with your\r\nopponent. Let yourself be cut to pieces, even to death but do not let\r\nany loss come to the Khilafat. Do not look towards Bagdad, neither do\r\nyou look towards the Army, but kill your enemy right and left. Do not\r\nlet any of your enemy to be left unkilled if you see him, and do not\r\nthink that you are alone, because you are being helped by Imam Mehdi,\r\nwho is standing in front of you. Call him, just fly a flag in your hand\r\nand cry out Khoda, Khoda, beat a drum in the name of Din Muhammad\r\nthroughout the lanes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIV\r\n\r\nGovernor's Warning\r\n\r\n_Calcutta, February 11_\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the Trades Association dinner in Calcutta, Lord Ronaldshay,\r\nthe Governor of Bengal, made a lengthy reference to the political\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nIt would be the height of unwisdom, said His Excellency, to close one's\r\neyes to the gravity of the situation with which not only the Government\r\nbut society in the widest meaning of that term is now faced. It seems\r\ndesirable to call attention to this because there still appear to be\r\nquite a number of people who in spite of all that has happened, in spite\r\nof the resort to violence which has characterised the Non-co-operation\r\nmovement in Malabar, Malegaon, Giridih. Aligarh, Bombay and many other\r\nplaces have not yet grasped the seriousness or the nearness of the\r\ndanger, with which the country is threatened.\r\n\r\nTake the case of the Non-co-operation volunteers. We are told by some\r\nthat we ought to withdraw our notification under the Act of 1908\r\ndeclaring these volunteer corps to be unlawful association. A\r\nrecommendation to that effect has quite recently been made to the\r\nGovernment by the Legislative Council. It is true that under the\r\nexisting constitution, we are still responsible to Parliament for the\r\nmaintenance of law and order and though it would no doubt save us much\r\ntrouble and anxiety if we were able to transfer the responsibility from\r\nour own shoulders to those of the Legislative Council, we cannot do so.\r\nNevertheless I have always regarded it as my duty to consider with the\r\nutmost care any recommendations which the Council makes and in this case\r\nI am calling for special reports as to the nature and extent of the\r\npresent activities of these volunteers in different parts of the\r\nprovince in order that I may have the fullest and most up-to-date\r\ninformation before me.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Defensive\r\n\r\nIn considering the matter in the meanwhile, I would point out to the\r\npublic at large something which, judging by the criticism to which we\r\nare subjected, had been overlooked, namely, that from the very beginning\r\nof the Non-co-operation movement right up to the present time, the\r\nGovernment have been on the defensive. It is the Non-co-operators who\r\nhave always attacked and by so doing have compelled the Government to\r\ntake up weapons for its defence.\r\n\r\nFor example I have heard it suggested that the Government have goaded\r\nthe Non-co-operators into Civil Disobedience by the measures which they\r\nhave recently taken. Nothing could be further from the truth. The policy\r\nof civil disobedience was accepted by the All-India Congress Committee\r\nat the beginning of November and it was not until towards the end of\r\nthat month that action against the volunteers was taken. Mr. Gandhi\r\nhimself, in moving the civil disobedience resolution on November 4th\r\ndefined civil disobedience as a civil revolution, which, wherever\r\npractised would mean the end of the Government's authority and open\r\ndefiance of the Government and its laws.\r\n\r\nWell, that seems to be explicit enough and it seems a little\r\nunreasonable, surely, that those who profess to be opposed to such a\r\nrevolution, should seriously urge the Government to lay aside the\r\nweapons, which it has only taken up to protect itself against, to use\r\nMr. Gandhi's words once more \"the destruction of its authority and the\r\nopen defiance of its laws\". Do those who object to these\r\nvolunteer-corps being declared to be unlawful associations realise what\r\nthese corps have been brought into existence for? They have no excuse\r\nfor not knowing, because Mr. Gandhi has himself explained quite frankly\r\nthe object, for which they are being recruited. He declared at the\r\nconference held in Bombay on January 14th that, even if a round table\r\nconference was to be held he would not stop the enlistment of volunteers\r\nfor a single moment. Why, because the enlistment was a preparation for\r\ncivil disobedience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Critics Answered\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt on that point at all, for we have also the letter\r\nwritten by Pandit Kunzru to Mr. Jinnah, in which he states that Mr.\r\nGandhi declared explicitly at the conference that the enrolment and\r\ntraining of volunteers for starting civil disobedience must be\r\ncontinued. Very well then, what we are asked to do is this: To declare\r\nthat the volunteer corps enrolled and trained for civil disobedience are\r\nlawful associations. Do those who urge us to take this step regard civil\r\ndisobedience as a lawful form of political activity? If they do not, by\r\nwhat process of reasoning, do they argue that the agency by which civil\r\ndisobedience is to be carried out should be declared by Government to be\r\na lawful agency?\r\n\r\nNow let us consider for a moment what the Non-co-operators mean by civil\r\ndisobedience in its most developed form. It has been explained by Mr.\r\nDip Narayan Singh a leading Non-co-operator of Behar. The procedure is\r\nto be as follows;--The chief civil officer in the area selected for its\r\noperation is to be given seven days to hand over the district to the\r\nNon-co-operators. The residents in the area are then to be ordered to\r\ndisobey all the orders and laws of the Government and to refuse to pay\r\ntaxes, register documents, and so on. At the same time the police\r\nstation and courts are to be surrounded and the officials to be told to\r\ndeposit their uniforms and other badges of office. The police stations\r\nand courts will then be treated as Swaraj property.\r\n\r\nYou well see that this bears out to the full declaration made by Mr.\r\nGandhi, in moving the civil disobedience resolution at the meeting of\r\nthe All-India Congress Committee on November 4th, that his programme of\r\ncivil disobedience constitutes a civil revolution, which, wherever\r\npractised, will mean the end of the Government's authority and the open\r\ndefiance of Government and its laws. Again I would ask, to those who\r\nwish these volunteers to be declared to be lawful wish to see this\r\nprogramme put into operation without a resort to violence, which will\r\ndrench the country in blood?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lesson of Chauri Chaura\r\n\r\nEven the milder forms of Non-co-operation activity such as\r\npicketing,--which is often claimed by the Non-co-operators to be\r\npeaceful pastime though even this claim is no longer maintained by Mr.\r\nGandhi as I shall show in a moment--result in wild orgies of violence as\r\nwe have been painfully reminded again, within the last few days by the\r\nhorrible crime at Chauri Chaura in the United Provinces. This outbreak,\r\nin which 21 police men and chaukidars were violently beaten to death was\r\ndeliberately organised, we are told, in the report from the\r\nCommissioners, by the volunteers, and if picketing results in orgies of\r\nmurder and destruction of this kind what are likely to be results of\r\nattempts to put into operation the full pledged programme of Civil\r\nDisobedience to which I have already referred?\r\n\r\nBut it seems, as I have already remarked that Mr. Gandhi no longer\r\nmaintains that all picketing is peaceful, for writing in his newspaper,\r\n\"Young India\" a short time ago, he says that in connection with the\r\nproposal for a round table conference his suggestion was that all\r\npicketing, except bona-fide peaceful picketing should be suspended\r\npending the result of the conference. Clearly then, in Mr. Gandhi's\r\nopinion picketing is of two kinds, bona fide peaceful picketing on the\r\none hand, and picketing which is not bona fide and peaceful on the\r\nother. Very well then, Mr. Gandhi knows that picketing is not peaceful.\r\nHe must know that the more drastic forms of civil disobedience, which he\r\nis now determined to embark upon, must lead to violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Issue\r\n\r\nIs it possible under these circumstances to come to any conclusion other\r\nthan that reached by the Government of India, that the issue is no\r\nlonger between this or that programme of political advance, but between\r\nlawlessness and all its dangerous consequences on the one hand, and on\r\nthe other hand, the maintenance of those principles, which lie at the\r\nroot of civilised Governments.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal civil disobedience has already taken the form in a number of\r\ndistricts of a refusal to pay the \"chaukidari\" tax, and I have already\r\nreceived complaints from landholders that tenants are refusing to pay\r\ntheir rent throughout the province.\r\n\r\nA general spirit of contempt for authority and defiance of law and order\r\nis being fostered. Well, respect for lawful authority and a general\r\nwillingness on the part of the people to observe the law are the pillars\r\nupon which the very existence of society rests. If these be cut away,\r\nsociety fall into the abyss of anarchy and is shattered. It is recorded\r\nof a famous figure in history that he fiddled while Rome was burning.\r\nThe story is one which is not without its moral for the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XV\r\n\r\nExtracts from the speech of the Hon'ble Sir Henry Wheeler, Member in\r\ncharge of Political Department\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the situation with which we are faced? It is the outcome of a\r\nmovement which, in pursuit of certain political aims, has resulted in\r\nevery province in India in bloodshed, disorder and confusion. A concise\r\npicture of the all India situation is contained in the report of the\r\ncommittee which recently inquired into the working of certain laws at\r\nSimla, and from it I quote their conclusion:--\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration all the evidence we have received and the\r\npoints to which we have adverted and bearing in mind the still\r\nprevailing economic discontent, we cannot dismiss as improbable the\r\ndanger of sudden sectarian, agrarian or labour disorder on a large scale\r\nculminating in riots.\r\n\r\nThey give instances of what they call 34 notable cases of disorder which\r\nhave occurred in India during the current year. That is, most briefly,\r\nthe position in India as a whole.\r\n\r\nLet me now give a few illustrations of the position in Bengal, with\r\nwhich we are more particularly concerned, for it is perhaps apt to be\r\noverlooked that the whole problem does not centre round Calcutta alone.\r\nThere is outside this city this vast Presidency of 40 millions people,\r\nand the difficulties in the _mufussal_ are just as acute as here. To\r\ncite an example--in the district of Rangpur we have lately had reported\r\nan organisation of volunteers under a district captain and four\r\nvice-captains, definitely named, supported by two subordinate officers\r\nin each thana and a regular budget and funds, which, in addition to the\r\nbetter known objects of the non-co-operation movement, had set before\r\nitself the following five aims.--\r\n\r\n (1) The organisation of volunteers to be ready for civil disobedience;\r\n\r\n (2) the preparation of the people to abstain from payment of chaukidari\r\n and union board tax;\r\n\r\n (3) the preparation of the tenants to refrain from paying rents;\r\n\r\n (4) the preparation of the people to boycott the thana and the law\r\n courts;\r\n\r\n (5) to boycott higher grade police and other officers especially with\r\n regard to foodstuffs, and if as a result of this the Government start\r\n their own store and make local arrangements it is felt that it will be\r\n possible to place difficulties in the way of transport.\r\n\r\nThis last line has in fact been taken and the Collector had to improvise\r\nsupplies of food to various thanas and registration office. The Council\r\nwill have noticed the use of the term \"civil disobedience,\" and in two\r\nother districts--namely, Noakhali and Faridpur--we have had the usual\r\nphenomena of a little knot of men forming themselves into a committee\r\nand saying: \"We will have civil disobedience.\" What is civil\r\ndisobedience understood to mean? Lest it be thought that it is merely an\r\nabstract subject for discussion, say, in a newspaper article, let me\r\nrefer to an interesting definition of the term which we have recently\r\nhad from a neighbouring province. The president of a meeting there\r\nlately outlined civil disobedience in the following terms:--\r\n\r\nA notice calling upon Government to grant Swaraj within seven days will\r\nfirst be served upon the chief civil officer present in the locality\r\nselected for civil disobedience. Subsequently the residents of the\r\nparticular locality will be directed to disobey all orders and laws of\r\nGovernment and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents, etc. At the\r\nsame time police stations and courts will be surrounded and the\r\nofficials told to deposit their uniforms and other badges of office.\r\nThereafter police-stations and courts will be treated as Swaraj\r\nproperty. That is a position which, I put in to the Council, can be\r\nsummed up in one word, \"anarchy.\" That is the civil disobedience which\r\nis being preached, and which, if we are to believe the three speeches\r\nwhich we have just heard, is a little excitement which, in the words of\r\none speaker, can be disposed of by a \"flick of a handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I could carry on these examples from the _mufassal_ to\r\nChittagon, which has been in a state of disturbance and agitation since\r\nApril last, and to Howrah where disturbances have been intermittent\r\nthroughout the year, culminating in firing in the streets and in the\r\ndeath of a policeman. But the chronicle is too long, and I pass to\r\nCalcutta, where the remarks of His Excellency have fortunately shortened\r\nmy task. We are all aware that the incessant stream of inflammatory\r\noratory and agitation in Calcutta culminated on the 17th November in a\r\nparalysis of the life of the city and I was even surprised, when\r\nrefreshing my memory as to those events, to see how openly what was done\r\nwas gloried in by the leaders of the non-co-operation movement as having\r\nbeen done by their orders and direction. They were good enough to define\r\nin their instructions who might go about the streets and who might not,\r\nI have seen the statement that by the kindness of the Congress and the\r\nKhilafat committees certain shops would be allowed to open at 12 noon.\r\nThere has never been any attempt to conceal the fact that the town was\r\nat that time, in the view of the non-co-operators, subject to their\r\norders--subject by the processes of intimidation with which we are well\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nNow if that was the position--and I submit that this is a correct\r\nstatement of the position--Government was obviously confronted with the\r\nquestion of what they were to do. Was this state of affairs to continue\r\nor was it to be checked? We were approached on all sides, in this\r\nCouncil and by such responsible bodies as the British Indian\r\nAssociation, to intervene and to restore some measure of law and order\r\nin a condition of things which was fast drifting to chaos. In these\r\ncircumstances we took the measures of which the Council is well aware,\r\nnamely, to declare certain associations to be illegal, to introduce the\r\nSeditious Meetings Act in one district and prohibit by order of the\r\nCommissioner of Police, meetings and processions in Calcutta. I put it\r\nto the Council that short of these measures it would not have been\r\npossible to comply with the urgent requests so reasonably made to us\r\nfrom so many quarters to intervene in the interests of decent\r\nadministration. That is the issue which is before the Council. Is it or\r\nis it not a fact that on the 17th of last month the people of this city\r\nwere disgusted with the state of affairs and the prevailing terrorism?\r\nIs it or is it not a fact that constant pressure was brought to bear on\r\nGovernment by all sections of the people to bring about a better state\r\nof affairs? Can it in truth be said that the action of Government in\r\nattempting to curtail the activities of the gentlemen to whom the\r\nexcitement is due has gone beyond the necessity of the case? If so, what\r\nis the alternative which the Council would place before Government? Of\r\nthat, however we have heard singularly little, except from Babu Surendra\r\nNath Mallik, who advises us to withdraw all our orders, release\r\nprisoners, reduce sentences and place on their trial the military and\r\nthe police--a solution which, I trust, will not commend itself to the\r\nbetter sense of the Council....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVI\r\n\r\nBEHAR AND ORISSA\r\n\r\nThe Speech of the Hon. Mr. Macpherson, Member of Government, at the\r\nmeeting of the Legislative Council Patna,\r\n\r\n_24th January 1922_\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, I desire to intervene at this stage of the debate, because I think\r\nit is proper that the House should know what the facts of the situation\r\nare before they make speeches and commit themselves to views which I\r\nhope they will be prepared to change after they know what the facts of\r\nthe situation really are. I must ask your indulgence, if I find that\r\nwhat I have to say on this important occasion will take me beyond the\r\nusual time limits.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first occasion on which the Government of Behar and\r\nOrissa have explained to the public their attitude towards the\r\nnon-co-operation movement and their reasons for the action taken on the\r\n10th December last, which forms the subject of this Resolution. As the\r\ncouncil is well aware, His Excellency the Governor received, a few days\r\nafter that date, an influential deputation of Council Members and\r\nexplained to them under what circumstances Government had been forced in\r\ndefence of the public safety to take action under the criminal Law\r\nAmendment Act. An account of that deputation was published in all the\r\nnewspapers which are commonly read in this Province and I trust it has\r\nbeen carefully perused by all the members of Council. I shall be\r\npardoned if, when I come to discuss the expediency of action taken by\r\nGovernment, I go over again the ground covered by the communique which\r\nwas issued on that occasion.\r\n\r\nWhat was the position with which the Local Government were faced in the\r\nbeginning of that month? During the past twelve months they have seen\r\nthese associations growing in number and boldness, spreading unrest\r\nthroughout the public life of the Province, poisoning and confusing the\r\nminds of simple people, interfering with liberty of action, and not\r\ninfrequently having to resort to force in order to compel obedience to\r\ntheir mandates. I have here a long list of cases in which persuasion was\r\nsupplemented by force, sometimes force of a very disgraceful kind but I\r\nwill not worry the Council by citing instances. This Province was not\r\nalone in these experiences, the organization of a volunteer\r\nrevolutionary army was proceeding apace in neighbouring provinces also.\r\nThe danger was being gradually realized by the Government of India and\r\nby other Local Governments, and before the end of November action under\r\nthe Criminal Law Amendment Act had been taken by the Governments of the\r\nPunjab, the United Provinces Delhi, Bengal, and Assam. The Government of\r\nBihar and Orissa stayed their hand till further inaction would have been\r\ncriminal folly. The two circumstances which brought matters to a head in\r\nthis province were\r\n\r\n 1 the immediate imminence of the introduction of the civil disobedience\r\n movement, particularly in the Tirhut Division, and,\r\n\r\n 2 the intensive preparations which were being made to organize a\r\n hostile _hartal_ in Patna City against the visit of His Royal Highness\r\n the Prince of Wales on the 22nd and 23rd December. I know that certain\r\n local non-co-operation leaders have denied that there was any intention\r\n to start the civil disobedience movement within the Province during the\r\n month of December or even up to the present date, and we have been told\r\n that the Patna _Hartal_ was a spontaneous movement on the part of the\r\n citizens. I think the Council will not be deceived by either of these\r\n assurances. After all Government had to follow the evidence at their\r\n disposal. There is one well-known leader of the local non-co-operation\r\n camp, called Mr. Dip Narayan Singh. At a meeting held at Bhagalpur on\r\n the 16th November this gentleman outlined the programme which the\r\n leaders intended to follow. According to him a notice calling upon\r\n Government to grant _Swaraj_ within seven days would first be served\r\n upon the chief civil officer present in the locality selected for civil\r\n disobedience, subsequently the residents of the particular locality\r\n would be directed to disobey all orders and laws of Government and to\r\n refuse to pay taxes, register documents, etc. At the same time police\r\n stations and courts would be surrounded and the officials told to\r\n deposit their uniforms and other badges of offices. Thereafter police\r\n stations and courts would be treated as _Swaraj_ property. On the top\r\n of this declaration of policy, the Local Government had information\r\n that the first experiment would be made with the Basantpur police\r\n station in the Chapra District. Now this has been denied by the\r\n Congress party but the intention was an open secret. I was told about\r\n it after our last session by a member of this Council, who shall be\r\n nameless, and apart from our police reports, we had it on the authority\r\n of the _Motherland_ dated the 26th November, that Chapra had been\r\n selected as the first object of attack. This is what the _Motherland_\r\n of November 29th, 1921, says. The heading is--\r\n\r\n\"+Civil Disobedience in Behar.+\"\r\n\r\nAnd the message runs:\r\n\r\n\"A meeting of the Provincial Congress Committee was held at Patna on\r\nSunday last. 33 delegates were elected for the coming session of the\r\nIndian National Congress at Ahmadabad. It was also resolved upon to form\r\na volunteer corps in pursuance of the resolution of the All India\r\nWorking Committee. The matter of selecting a suitable area for preparing\r\nit for Civil Disobedience was referred to the Provincial Working\r\nCommittee which met on Monday last and decided in favour of Chapra in\r\npreference to the claims of Katra Thana in the district of Muzaffarpur,\r\nwhich were backed up by Muhammad Shafi.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Motherland_ is a local organ of the revolutionary party and the\r\nproperty of Mr. Mazharul Haqq, who is the one of the shining lights in\r\nthat camp, and presumably is in the confidance of the party. We know\r\nalso from the public press that the previous volunteer associations, our\r\nold friends, the 'Khilafat' the 'Congress' and the 'Swaraj' volunteers\r\nwere to be replaced by a new organization to be called the \"National\r\nVolunteers\" and we knew from our own reports that the particular name to\r\nbe affected by the new organization of non-violent volunteers in Behar\r\nwas the _Qaumi Sebak Dal_. Perhaps members of this Council would like to\r\nknow something about the organization of this Behar _Sebak Dal_. This is\r\nwhat we heard about its organization.\r\n\r\nEach squad was to consist of 20 volunteers. 20 squads would make a\r\ncompany _Maha Dal_, in this there would be 400 volunteers. Each squad\r\nwould be under an officer.\r\n\r\nOver 20 assistants there would be a higher officer. What he would\r\ndictate all the four hundred volunteers would have to observe.\r\n\r\nThe Bihar _Sebak Dal's_ duty would be \"Revolution\" even if they had to\r\nsacrifice their lives.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what we were told about their plans of campaign:\r\n\r\nIt was first to attack all the police-stations of the district and to\r\ntake them into their possession, after removing the Inspectors, Jamadars\r\nand the Police.\r\n\r\nWhen the thana had been taken possession of, then the _Kachahri_ would\r\nhave to be taken possession of and the _Hakims_ would be removed.\r\n\r\nCivil disobedience would commence in Chapra District from village\r\nBasantpur, in Muzaffarpur from thana Katra, and then Sitamarhi.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the information on which the Local Government had to act.\r\nDoes the Council still wonder that action of the nature taken was taken?\r\nTo those who protest that the information held by Government was\r\nunreliable I can only reply that it has been fully corroborated not only\r\nby what has happened in other Provinces and by published documents of\r\nthe non-co-operation movement but also by what has happened under our\r\nvery noses in this Province. The non-co-operators say that it was never\r\nin contemplation to make an attack on Basantpur police-station on the\r\n10th December. We believe that this particular experiment was nipped to\r\nthe bud by the Notification of the same date, which found the leaders\r\nassembled at Chapra and threw them into consternation. But how do they\r\nexplain the raids which were actually made at a somewhat later date on\r\nthe police-station of Sonbarsa, Raghupur and Mahua in the District of\r\nMuzaffarpur, or the attempt to picket the Gaya Civil Courts on the\r\nopening day after the X'mas holidays, which was only frustrated by the\r\ndespatch of troops from Patna to Gaya on the previous evening? Were all\r\nthese fortuitous and accidental? Do all these evidences of intention\r\nexist only in the heated imagination of the police? I shall have\r\noccasion later to tell the Council what effect these raids have had on\r\nthe internal condition of the Muzaffarpur District. My present object is\r\nonly to prove that when the Local Government took action under the\r\nCriminal Law Amendment Act on the 10th December, they were fully\r\njustified in believing that the civil disobedience movement would be\r\nstarted at a very early date in the Tirhut Division.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to weary the Council by going into details regarding the\r\nPatna _hartal_. It seemed to Government, and with good reason, that\r\nefforts were being made to impose an intolerable tyranny on the citizens\r\nof Patna at a time when the representatives of the people, who sit in\r\nthis Council, had extended to his Royal Highness a most cordial welcome\r\nand had voted a special grant to make that welcome worthy of the\r\noccasion. The object of the non-co-operators was to substitute for the\r\nwelcome the same kind of deliberate insult that had been attempted to be\r\noffered to the Royal visitor at Benares and Allahabad. Government, I\r\nsay, would have been open to the gravest reproach if it had made no\r\neffort to counteract that mean and wicked project, which was so foreign\r\nto the innate hospitality and reverence of the Indian people, and\r\nparticularly repugnant, one would imagine, to the sturdy loyalty of\r\nBihar. Under this double compulsion then Government decided that the\r\ntime had come to follow the example of its neighbours. Members of\r\nCouncil know as well as I do what followed. There was, as Government\r\nexpected there would be, much excitement in the city--the stirring of a\r\nhornet nest always has this sort of reaction.\r\n\r\nSir, let not this Council be deceived by any cry of repression, by any\r\nfalse appeal for the freedom of association and the freedom of speech.\r\nThis Government is not out for repression. It has no desire to interfere\r\nwith political activity or freedom of speech. When Mr. Gandhi and his\r\nfriends use these phrases, what they mean is license to preach sedition,\r\nand liberty to foment rebellion and revolution. Let us see how the\r\nsystem works in practice. I will read to the Council a recent report on\r\ncondition of the Muzaffarpur District. It is dated the 5th January:--\r\n\r\n\"The Muzaffarpur District still continues to be in very disturbed state\r\nparticularly the Sitamarhi Subdivision, where it is reported that law\r\nand order are decreasing daily and Magistrates are even insulted in\r\ntheir own Courts. The Sitamarhi Sub-jail is said to be practically in a\r\nstate of mutiny, the prisoners shouting and singing all day until about\r\n10 P.M., while on one occasion a warder was rushed and knocked down.\r\nAdditional police have been asked for this subdivision and are badly\r\nrequired. The Masses in this district are said to have no longer any\r\ndread of going to jail owing to the inducements held out to them that\r\nthey will be treated as political prisoners and fare better than in\r\ntheir own homes. The police have come in for more than their fair share\r\nof attention from the non-co-operators during the week and the\r\nSuperintendent of Police is of opinion that his force has become\r\nexasperated almost beyond endurance by the gross insults and abuse that\r\nhas been heaped upon them.\r\n\r\n\"On the 26th December 1921, about 200 volunteers escorted by a large and\r\nnoisy mob forced their way into the Sonbarsa Thana compound in the\r\nSitamarhi Subdivision, carrying swaraj flag and repeating the Delhi\r\nfatwa. The thana police were told that to remain in Government service\r\nwas for a Hindu equivalent to eating cow's flesh and for a Muhammadan to\r\neating pig. Later the crowd became more insulting and abusive and though\r\nseven of the ringleaders were arrested, the crowd did not disperse until\r\nnearly midnight. Following this incident the whole of the thana staff\r\nwere boycotted, the services of the barber, washermen and even supplies\r\nof food were stopped, until the divisional inspector succeeded in\r\nintervening.\r\n\r\n\"At Raghupur Police-station in the same district, 300 volunteers\r\nappeared and told the sub-inspector that on the 1st January they would\r\nplant the swaraj flag in the compound and take possession of the\r\npolice-station. At Mahua Police-station, the Police were also grossly\r\nabused and insulted and similar reports have been received by the\r\nSuperintendent of Police from other police stations in the district.\r\n\r\n\"Mention was made in last week's report of a fracas in the Court\r\ncompound at Hajipur where alms were being distributed to the poor. This\r\nwas followed on the same day by a parade of 100 Sevak Dal volunteers in\r\nfront of the Hajipur police-station who shouted _Sarkar ki nokri karna\r\nharam hai_ and grossly abused the Police.\r\n\r\n\"Reports received from factories also indicate a serious state of unrest\r\nin the Mufassal. Mr. G. P. Danby writing from Bowarrah factory mentions\r\nthat noisy shouting bands of volunteers are moving about the country\r\nmaking themselves a general nuisance and that to all appearance mob law\r\nprevails. The Belsand Factory in this district is reported to have been\r\nsurrounded on the 4th January by a large mob shouting _Gandhi ki jai_.\r\nEuropeans and loyal Indians are expressing their disappointment that\r\nGovernment did not continue strong measures against the non-co-operation\r\nmovement.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a police report, and lest the Council may think it is highly\r\ncoloured I will read a shorter note of the Divisional Commissioner, Mr.\r\nScroope, who is a man of sober judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield, Subdivisional Officer Sitamarhi, came to see me yesterday\r\nbefore I left for Bankipur. He is a level-headed officer and in no sense\r\nan alarmist. He informed me that the police are no longer able to deal\r\nwith non-co-operators in Sitamarhi town. The latter are practically in\r\npossession of the liquor shops which they now picket with impunity. They\r\nalso haunt the neighbourhood of the Court and create much noise and\r\ndisorder during the trial to political cases. They ask to be arrested\r\nand some of them who have been placed under trial under section 290,\r\nIndian Penal Code have been grossly insulting to the Magistrate. The\r\njourneys to and from Court of persons under trial for a political\r\noffence are made regular occasions for noisy demonstrations and abuse of\r\nGovernment. Mr. Mansfield's considered opinion is that non-co-operators\r\nare now entirely out of hand, that the existing police force is quite\r\nunequal to the task of keeping them in check and that law and order have\r\npractically ceased to exist in Sitamarhi town.\r\n\r\nThe sub-jail can only be described as in a state of mutiny. It is much\r\novercrowded containing about 90 inmates (I am not certain of the exact\r\nnumber; almost all are under trials) and certain influential\r\nnon-co-operators under trials have been preaching defiance and\r\ninsubordination to their companions. The result is a total absence of\r\ndiscipline; the undertrials sing and shout at the top of their voices\r\nthroughout the day and most of the night and any attempts on the part of\r\nthe warders to enforce order and obedience are wholly ignored.\r\n\r\nHere is a latter report of the doings of one of these roving bands of\r\nwhom mention is made in the police report. The Superintendent of Police\r\nwrites on the 21st January.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I received a telegram from Mr. Gray, Meanchupra.\r\n\r\n\"All roads here stopped by volunteers. No carts or servants allowed\r\nworks. Come if possible, position critical\".\r\n\r\nI left at 2 P.M. and arrived Meanchupra at about 3 P.M.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 yards on the road west of Meanchupra I found some volunteers\r\nsitting on a culvert guarding the road. On arrival at the Bungalow I\r\nfound Mr. and Mrs. Gray and their three children absolutely shut off and\r\nisolated by three volunteers. All the Factory work had been stopped as\r\nthe jamadar peons and coolies were not allowed to enter the factory so\r\nthat there was no one to cut the sugarcane etc. All carts had been\r\nstopped, volunteers cutting the ropes of the bullocks and driving them\r\naway. Even the house servants had been stopped from going to the\r\nbungalow from their village. There was no bearer, cooks _mashalchi_,\r\n_dhobe_, garden coolies or even _murgiwala_. Mrs. Grey had to dig up the\r\npotatoes in the garden, cook the food, wash up the dishes, etc., and her\r\nayah asked her (as well she might) if it was true that the British Raj\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nSir, these are the facts which have already compelled Government to post\r\na force of additional police to the Sitamarhi subdivision, and I do not\r\ndisguise from the Council that they may force us at no distant date to\r\ntake even sterner measures to preserve the peace of the district, and of\r\nother districts that are similarly threatened. If Government find it\r\nnecessary later to present to Council a bill of costs which will not be\r\nat all to their liking, let them thank their non-co-operation friends\r\nfor the gift.\r\n\r\nI know we shall be met with the old cry of repression, but in this case\r\nit is a stupid cry. No Government of this country wants repression for\r\nrepression's sake, and least of all the Government of Bihar and Orissa,\r\nwhich includes within its number three distinguished Indians who have\r\nnever been accused of any lack of political independence. For my own\r\npart I claim that no one welcomed more keenly than I did the\r\ninauguration of the new reforms era in India. I had the confident hope\r\n(and in this matter I speak also for my hon'ble colleague, Sir Havilland\r\nLe Mesurier) that we had before us a great and inspiring task of\r\nfriendly co-operation with educated Indians, which would at no very\r\ndistant date place this country in the forefront of the common-wealth of\r\nnations. Sir, this great task has for the moment been heavily\r\nhandicapped and hampered by the poisonous cult of non-co-operation, a\r\ncult which has embittered and clouded the political life of India and\r\ncaused discouragement to all the friends of reform. It has made life a\r\nburden and weariness to all ranks of Government officers, to the\r\nresponsible agents of Government in districts and to the directing staff\r\nat headquarters but I have still hope that the better sense of India\r\nwill prevail and that the clouds will clear away. It is to you, members\r\nof the Council, that Government look to give a lead to the public which\r\nyou represent, in the fight against this great danger which menaces\r\nIndia. The danger is not one which threatens only the officers of\r\nGovernment, professional men, and men of wealth and property. The\r\ninterests of the common people, the patient cultivators and the toiling\r\nworkmen, are just as much at stake. It is they who will suffer most, if\r\nrevolution comes, as the same classes are suffering to-day in Russia\r\nwhere they are perishing in millions as a result of the disintegration\r\nof ordered Government. I call therefore upon the representatives of all\r\nclasses in this assembly to consider what is their duty, their solemn\r\nduty, on this occasion. The choice is between the orderly progress of\r\nIndia towards a future of brightest promise and the perilous path of\r\nrevolution which leads to darkness and death. There is no midway between\r\nthem. I appeal to you, gentlemen of the Council, to put aside any\r\npre-conceived notions or prepared speeches with which you may have\r\nentered this hall to-day and to look at the position in all its naked\r\ntruth. The question you have to decide for yourself is whether you stand\r\nfor orderly Government or revolution. I trust that the hon'ble mover\r\nhimself will realize his responsibility in the light of these remarks\r\nand withdraw his resolution now that it has served its purpose of\r\nsecuring a full discussion of the political situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVII\r\n\r\nDisgraceful Tyranny\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from the speech delivered by the Hon. Mr.\r\nHammond, the officiating Chief Secretary of the Bihar and Orissa\r\nGovernment, during the recent debate in the Provincial Council on the\r\npolitical situation. _The Pioneer 1st February, 22._\r\n\r\n\r\nHas the hon. member read what has just happened in Guntur, in Madras,\r\nwhere rents are being withheld? Is he aware that not in one but in two\r\nor three districts in the Province there have been refusals to pay\r\nchaukidari taxes; that we have read not one but several speeches\r\nadvocating this refusal? May I tell the Council that barely three or\r\nfour days ago, in the district of Puri, a Panch assessor was murdered\r\nwhile endeavouring to collect chaukidari tax? Swami Vidyanand and others\r\nwho followed and desclaimed against repressive laws enquired what have\r\nthe \"volunteers\" done? It is a pertinent question, and, with your\r\npermission, Sir, I will give a few instances by way of answer. Time does\r\nnot allow me to go through all their nefarious activities, but if Hon.\r\nmembers want to know what the \"volunteers\" have done, apart from\r\nenforced _hartal_ and the ordinary common forms of secret intimidation,\r\nask the widow of the Mahomedan, Mazir Ali Kalal, whose corpse was\r\nexhumed in Ranchi, thrown upon the public road and the face beaten in\r\nwith a brick; ask Gopi Khar at Chatra, who on the 3rd January was beaten\r\nand taken with his face blackened through the town because his wife\r\ncommitted the foul crime of selling food to those who visited liquor\r\nshops. Is that persuasion? Is this _Ahimsa_? ask the woman of Kateya,\r\nMussammatt Paremia Koerin, near Siwan, who was stripped naked and driven\r\nthrough the village by a howling mob. She complained as well she might\r\nto the Government police officer, who, when he went to hold an enquiry\r\nwas attacked by a mob--a demonstration in force of soul-force! A speaker\r\nlater in the debate declaimed against those, the Planters and the\r\npolice, whose courage, he said, \"took the form of delight in tyrannising\r\nover the poor and of oppressing their fellow-countrymen.\" I ask in all\r\nsincerity what are these cases I have related but a disgraceful\r\ntyranny; are they not, indeed, 'oppression of the poor?' \"What right?\" I\r\nshall be asked \"have you to lay these crimes at the doors of the\r\nnon-co-operation party?\" The answer is, that when men publicly oppose\r\nthe funeral it is not irrational to believe that they are concerned with\r\nthe subsequent exhumation of the corpse. In the other cases I have\r\nmentioned evidence has been taken and there is the judicial finding.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth and South of the Ganges\r\n\r\nAnother member asked me to explain the difference between the positions\r\nnorth and south of the Ganges. Let us take this town of Patna. The hon.\r\nmember did not, as some do, deny _in toto_ that, there had been\r\nintimidation. I say there is in fact but little difference. In Tirhut\r\nthe crime manifest and overt, and in Patna it is suppressed. Have the\r\nCouncil heard of those poor beggars who received tickets entitling to go\r\nto Gulzarbagh on the morning of the 22nd December and get blankets? Do\r\nthey know that these people were asked by \"volunteers\" on their way to\r\nshow their tickets which were then taken and torn up, that the same day\r\nsome of the beggars when returning from Gulzarbagh were deprived of the\r\nblankets which they had been given which were burnt, and the beggars had\r\nto be content with such warmth, as they could derive from the glow of\r\nenforced patriotism. The difference between this side of the Ganges and\r\nthe other is that in Patna such things do not unfortunately in a large\r\ncity attract much attention.\r\n\r\nOh! the shame of it, a blind beggar woman deprived of her blanket, but\r\nno violence of course was used, only soul-force. Babu Ganesh Dutt\r\nappealed to justice and sympathy. Do these beggars deserve no sympathy?\r\nIs there to be no justice done on their oppressors? I shall be told that\r\nthe leaders of the movement disavow such action; that they deplore them\r\nas much as we do. Sir, we cannot separate the methods from the ideals of\r\nthe revolutionary movement. I am prepared to believe that some of the\r\nleaders deplore violence and would try to restrain it, but I maintain,\r\nand I challenge, any hon. member here to disprove it that, conducted on\r\nthe lines as it is, admitting such members as it does to its ranks, the\r\nnon-co-operation movement must inevitably result in violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Giridih Riots\r\n\r\nLet us take the case to which reference had been made before in this\r\nCouncil, the serious riots which occurred at Giridih, and which ended in\r\nan attack upon the sub-jail and the thana and the burning of the\r\nrecords. From what did that originate? It is a simple story. A sold B a\r\ncow and said that she would yield 1-1/2 seers of milk. B took the cow\r\naway and found that he did not get the guaranteed amount of milk.\r\nLawyers here know that the law of warranty is a somewhat difficult and\r\nintricate matter. However the local self constituted Panches decided\r\nthat, A should take back the cow and refund the money. He declined to do\r\nso; and then as sanction to enforce the orders of this local court\r\napplied that cruel engine of oppression, social boycott. In all\r\ncivilised communities the black-mailer is regarded with disgust and\r\ncondemned. It has been for the non-co-operation party to use social\r\nblackmail as the basis of sanction to its ideals. The inevitable result\r\nof such a sanction is violence.\r\n\r\nWhat are the \"volunteers\" doing? They are fishing in troubled waters.\r\nThey tried--let us once again come back to Patna--to get the domestic\r\nservants to strike: they succeeded in persuading some of the motor-car\r\ndrivers to desert their masters when their services were most required.\r\nWhat are the \"volunteer's\" doing? They are persuading raiyats to\r\nwithhold rent. I know the case of a wealthy zamindar who had to borrow\r\nmoney from the bank to pay his Government revenue. I maintain, sir, that\r\nthough honest men amongst the non-co-operators speak of non-violence the\r\nmovement must inevitably lead to violence.\r\n\r\nTake an instance from private life--let us again quote from Patna. A\r\ngentleman returning from Calcutta, a man well acquainted with the law of\r\nthe land, found that his servant had, at the bidding of one gentleman\r\nwho is an active recruiting officer of \"volunteers,\" decided to break\r\nthe contract made with his master. I have the best authority for saying\r\nthis breach of contract resulted in righteous indignation which took the\r\nform of personal violence. What are these \"volunteers\" doing? They are\r\nprovoking violence; they are picketing; they are intimidating; they are\r\ninterfering between the master and servant, between landlord and tenant,\r\nbetween the railway and its employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Volunteers\" Recruited from Criminal Classes\r\n\r\nI know it will be said that efforts have been made to purify the ranks.\r\nIt was found, for example, in Chapra, that _doms_, registered as\r\ncriminal tribes, were enlisted in the ranks of the national\r\n\"volunteers.\" From the other districts, too, came reports of ex-convicts\r\nand persons of the \"C\" class register not only being enrolled but being\r\nwelcomed. The efforts to remove these members and to purify the movement\r\ndoes not seem likely to be successful if we may judge from a leader's\r\nexperience in the Bhagalpur Division, at Banka, in the district of\r\nBhagalpur. There I am informed, when he visited some villages with a\r\nview to expelling the undesirables, he was himself expelled and told to\r\nmind his own business. I submit, sir, for the earnest consideration of\r\nthis Council that you can not separate principles from methods or the\r\nideals from the agents who are employed. Lastly, we have had an appeal\r\nthat this Council should share the responsibility for maintenance of law\r\nand order. We have been solemnly advised by some of the speakers that\r\nGovernment should abdicate from the duty imposed by Statute of\r\nmaintaining law and order in favour of these \"volunteers\" who were, so\r\nwe are asked to believe, inaugurated solely to prevent a recurrence of\r\nthe scenes that occurred in Bombay--to stop women being stripped of\r\ntheir clothes in the streets, to stop murder and loot. Can Government\r\nfor a moment, in view of the activities I have related, contemplate\r\nhanding over the duty, the primary and essential duty of the police, to\r\nthe Kanmi Sevak Dal? The question has only to be asked to show its\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Counter-Propaganda\r\n\r\nThe only piece of practical advice we received from Mr. Madan was that\r\npropaganda should be met by counter propaganda. But there are\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nFirst how many of the hon. members would be willing to take up the task\r\nof propaganda? Secondly, how many of them would be listened to if they\r\ndid? How many of these would be able to obtain a hearing? I confess it\r\nseems to me, when Hon. members have protested that Government do not\r\npublish all the facts, that the time may come when every district and\r\nSub-Divisional Magistrate ought to be his own publicity officer. In the\r\nlast week we should have had stories in the papers of ladies being\r\ninsulted in Monghyr, pushed into the road, and spat upon. We should have\r\nread of the wife of a settlement Officer, with her sister-in-law, being\r\ninsulted by school-boys one of the ladies having her head cut with a\r\nstone; and from many districts we should have heard that pitiful tale of\r\nlittle children whose lips can hardly lisp the popular war cry being\r\ntaught to shout it, not as a tale of admiration for an ascetic idealist,\r\nnor as reverence for a person of mystic magnetism, but as a mark of\r\nracial hatred, a hymn of hate. We could have published instances from\r\nMuzaffarpur and Champaran of the insults to Europeans, of mob roaming\r\nabout shouting and committing mischief. Hon. members would have heard of\r\nMagistrates unable to hold trials because of the noise in the Court\r\ncompounds. All these and more should have been done in the way of\r\ncounter propaganda, exposing the methods of what is in fact a\r\nrevolutionary movement, but would much good have been done thereby? Is\r\nit not more important to take steps to prevent such things happening? I\r\nask the hon. members to remember that every vote given in favour of this\r\nresolution is a direct encouragement to the non-co-operation party they\r\nprofess to abhor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVIII\r\n\r\nDEMAND FOR AN INDIAN \"REPUBLIC\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hazrat Mohani's Address\r\n\r\nAHMEDABAD, DEC. 30--The following is the full text of the\r\nauthorised translation of the address, which Moulana Hazrat\r\nMohani delivered this afternoon and which was, from the beginning\r\nto the end a plea for the declaration from the 1st January, 1922, of\r\nan Indian Republic called the United States of India to be attained\r\nby all possible and proper means, including guerilla warfare in\r\ncase Martial Law was proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN--While thanking you for electing me to preside over this\r\nsession of the All-India Muslim League I wish to say in all sincerity\r\nthat the importance of this session of the League, in which the faith of\r\nHindustan is to be decided required the choice of a person abler than\r\nmyself, such as Moulana Muhammed Ali, Dr. Kitchlew or Moulana Abdul\r\nKulam Azad to preside over its deliberation but, unfortunately, the\r\nGovernment has forcibly taken away the first two gentlemen from us, I\r\nexpress my inability to accept the responsibility. Consequently, as the\r\nproverb goes, \"if thou dos't not accept it willingly, it will be forced\r\non thee\" this great duty was placed on my weak shoulders. I wish to\r\ndischarge it to the best of my ability. Success is in the hand of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aims of the League\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the League appears to be very weak, indeed, but\r\nthis does not in the least derogate from its real importance for it was\r\nthe All-India Muslim League which actually realised. The first and the\r\nmost essential condition of Indian independence is the Hindu-Muslim\r\nunity, and now that it has been achieved it is the duty of the League to\r\nmaintain it also. Besides, it is on the platform of the League that all\r\nsections of political opinion amongst the Musalmans, Extremists or\r\nModerates, have so far been and in future will, probably, be brought\r\ntogether. Before going into the causes of the weakness of the League, it\r\nwill be better to enumerate the aims and object of the League. These are\r\n(1) the attainment of Swaraj by the people of India by all peaceful and\r\nlegitimate means; (2) to protect and advance the political, religious\r\nand other rights and interests of the Indian Musalmans; (3) to promote\r\nfriendship and union between the Musalmans and other communities of\r\nIndia and (4) to maintain and strengthen brotherly relations between the\r\nMusalmans of India and those of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe League an Old Calendar\r\n\r\nThe first of these is also known to be the creed of the Congress.\r\nTherefore, so long as the word Swaraj is not defined in consonance with\r\nMuslim desire and the means for its attainment are not amplified, it is\r\nonly natural that Muslim interests in League should be clear. The third\r\nobject, Hindu-Muslim unity, is the common object both of the League and\r\nthe Congress. The fourth object, the unity of Muslim world, which has\r\nbeen, along with other questions, connected with the Khilafat has been\r\nspecially taken up by the Khilafat Committee. There remains only the\r\nsecond object that is the protection of the special interest of the\r\nMuslmans. As to this, so long as a much greater and more important\r\nobject, that is, the attainment of Swaraj still remains unachieved,\r\npeople would rather direct their united efforts against the common enemy\r\nthan look after their special interests. They will be attended to when\r\nthe time comes for it. As if these causes were not sufficient in\r\nthemselves, to decrease Muslim influence in the League, its rules and\r\nregulations were, unfortunately, so framed that, while public opinion\r\nhas developed at a rapid pace most members of the League have not moved\r\nan inch from their first position. As a result, the League remains\r\nnothing more than an old calendar. It is very necessary to remove the\r\ncauses of the weakness of the League and to remove them immediately, for\r\nin proportion as we approach nearer and nearer to the goal of Swaraj the\r\nneed of the League will be felt more and more, because questions of\r\nspecial Muslim rights will rise again with greater importance when India\r\nis free.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Indian \"Republic\"\r\n\r\nOur first duty, therefore, should be to reduce the fee for the\r\nmembership of the League and thus increase its members, who will choose\r\ntheir representatives of the League every year. The members to the\r\nCouncil of the Provincial and the All-India Muslim Leagues should be\r\nchosen as in the case of the Congress every year. But the most pressing\r\nnecessity of all is a change in the first object of the League to suit\r\nthe changed Muslim conditions. Everyone of us knows that the word Swaraj\r\nhas been definitely left vague and undefined in the creed of the\r\nCongress. The object of it has been that, if the Khilafat and the Panjab\r\nwrongs, are settled on the lines of our demands, then Swaraj within the\r\nBritish Empire will be considered sufficient; otherwise efforts will be\r\ndirected towards the attainment of complete independence. But, gentlemen\r\nfrom the Muslim point of view it is not enough that we should stand for\r\ncomplete independence alone. It is necessary to decide upon the form\r\nthat it should take and in my opinion it can only be an Indian Republic\r\nor on the lines of the United States of India.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the term \"peaceful\", which defines and restricts the scope\r\nof the legitimate means for the attainment of Swaraj in the Congress\r\ncreed, is opposed to the nature and religious aspirations of the\r\nMusalmans. Therefore, in the creed of the League the words \"possible\"\r\nand \"Proper\" should be substituted for the words \"Legitimate\" and\r\n\"Peaceful\". I will explain the matter in detail. The Musalmans should\r\nunderstand clearly that they derive a two-fold advantage from the\r\nestablishment of an Indian Republic, firstly, the general benefit which\r\nthey will undoubtedly share along with their Indian brethren as citizens\r\nof a common State and secondly, the special advantage which the\r\nMusalmans will derive from it is that, with every decline in the\r\nprestige and power of the British Empire, which, to-day is the worst\r\nenemy of Muslim countries, the Muslim world will get breathing time and\r\nopportunity to improve its conditions. Gentlemen, in spite of the\r\npresent Hindu-Muslim unity, there still exists many serious\r\nmisunderstandings and suspicions between these two great communities of\r\nHindustan, and it is of primary importance that we should grasp the true\r\nnature of these misunderstandings. The Hindus have a lurking suspicion\r\nthat given an opportunity, the Musalmans will either invite their\r\nco-religionists from outside to invade India or will, at least help\r\nthem, in case they invaded to plunder and devastate Hindustan, and these\r\nmisunderstandings are so deep-rooted and widespread that, so far as my\r\nknowledge goes, no Indian statesman has escaped it, except the late\r\nLokamanya Tilak. On the other hand, the Musalmans suspect that on the\r\nachievement of Self-Government, the Hindus will acquire greater\r\npolitical powers and will use their numerical superiority to crush the\r\nMusalmans. Gentlemen, it is quite clear that these misunderstandings can\r\nonly be won over by a compromise discussion and mutual and intimate\r\nknowledge, and it is an essential condition of this mutual understanding\r\nthat the third party should not come between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHindus and Muslims\r\n\r\nThe generality of Musalmans, with few exceptions, are afraid of the\r\nnumerical superiority of the Hindus and are absolutely opposed to an\r\nordinary reform scheme as a substitute for complete independence. The\r\nprimary reason for this is that in a merely reformed, as contrasted with\r\nan independent Government they will be under a double suspicion, first,\r\na subjection to the Government of India, which will be common to Hindus\r\nand Musalmans, secondly, a rejection by a Hindu majority, which they\r\nwill have to face in every department of the Government. On the other\r\nhand, if the danger of the English power is removed, the Musalmans will\r\nonly have the Hindu Majority to fear. Fortunately this fear is such as\r\nwill be automatically removed, with the establishment of the Indian\r\nrepublic for, while the Musalmans, as a whole, are in a minority in\r\nIndia, yet Nature has provided a compensation, for the Musalmans are not\r\nin a minority in all Provinces. In some Provinces, such as Kashmere, the\r\nPunjab, Sind, Bengal and Assam, the Musalmans are more numerous than the\r\nHindus. This Muslim majority will be an assurance that in the United\r\nStates of India the Hindu majority in Madras, Bombay and the United\r\nProvinces will not be allowed to overstep the limits of moderation\r\nagainst the Musalmans. Similarly, so long as a completely liberated\r\nIndia does not come into the hands of the Hindus and Musalmans\r\nthemselves, the Hindus will be always suspicious that, in case of a\r\nforeign invasion, the Musalmans will aid their co-religionist invaders,\r\nbut on the establishment of the Indian Republic, which will be shared in\r\ncommon by the Musalmans and Hindus there will be no possibility of such\r\na suspicion, for no Musalman will desire that the power of even a Muslim\r\nforeigner should be established over this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mopla Rebellion\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have just stated it as a necessary condition of the\r\nHindu-Muslim compromise that the third party, the English, should not be\r\nallowed to step in between us. Otherwise, all our affairs will fall into\r\ndisorder. Its best example is before you in the shape of the Mopla\r\nincident. You are probably aware that Hindu India has an open and direct\r\ncomplaint against the Moplas and an indirect complaint against all of us\r\nthat the Moplas are plundering and spoiling their innocent Hindu\r\nneighbours, but probably, you are not aware that the Moplas justify\r\ntheir action on the ground that at such a critical juncture, when they\r\nare engaged in a war against the English, their neighbours not only do\r\nnot help them or observe neutrality, but aid and assist the English in\r\nevery possible way. They can, no doubt, contend that, while they are\r\nfighting a defensive war for the sake of their religion and have left\r\ntheir houses, property and belongings and taken refuge in hills and\r\njungles, it is unfair to characterise as plunder their commandeering of\r\nmoney, provisions and other necessaries for their troops from the\r\nEnglish or their supporters. Gentlemen, both are right in their\r\ncomplaints, but so far as my investigation goes, the cause of this\r\nmutual recrimination can be traced to the interference of the third\r\nparty. It happens thus, whenever any English detachment suddenly appears\r\nin the locality and kills or captures the Moplas inhabitants of the\r\nplace, rumour somehow spreads in the neighbourhood that the Hindu\r\ninhabitants of the place had invited the English army for their\r\nprotection, with the result that after the departure of the English\r\ntroops the Moplas or their neighbours do not hesitate to retaliate and\r\nconsider the money and other belongings of the Hindus as lawful spoils\r\nof war taken from those who have aided and abetted the enemy. Where no\r\nsuch events have occurred, the Moplas and Hindus even now live\r\npeacefully side by side, Moplas do not commit any excesses against the\r\nHindus, while the Hindus do not hesitate in helping the Moplas to the\r\nbest of their ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nA National Parliament.\r\n\r\nI have wandered far from my purpose, I meant to emphasise that, in the\r\nfirst clause dealing with the aims and objects of the League, the word\r\n\"Swaraj\" should be defined as complete republic. Otherwise, there is a\r\ndanger that in the presence of a third party, Self-Government within the\r\nBritish Empire, instead of being beneficial, might actually prove\r\ninjurious. The second amendment necessary is that the methods for the\r\nattainment of Swaraj should be amplified. In the place \"peaceful\" and\r\n\"legitimate\" means \"possible\" and \"proper\" should be permitted. Thus, on\r\nthe one hand, the opportunity of joining the League will be given to\r\nthose who do not honestly believe Non-Co-operation alone as the sole\r\npath of salvation, recognising the possibility of other methods and\r\nadopting them also. On the other hand, the amendment will remove the\r\ncomplaint of those who believe the Non-Co-operation can under no\r\ncircumstances, remain peaceful to the last, and while subscribing to the\r\ncreed of the Congress and the first clause of the section dealing with\r\nthe object of the League as a matter of policy and expediency, refuse to\r\nadmit it as a faith for all times and circumstances or to remain\r\nnon-violent even in intention.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, there are only two possible means of replacing one Government\r\nby another one, the destruction of the Government by sword and the\r\nestablishment of another in its place, a method which has been followed\r\nin the world thus far. The second alternative is to sever all connection\r\nwith the present Government, and to set up a better or organised\r\nGovernment: parallel to it and improve and develop it till the old\r\norder is dissolved and the new takes its place. Friends, to achieve this\r\nobject, we must immediately set upon a separate and permanent foundation\r\nour courts, schools, arts, industries, army, police and a national\r\nparliament. Non-violent Non-Co-operation can only help to paralyse the\r\nGovernment, but cannot maintain it. The question now is, can such a\r\nparallel Government be established only through non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation of course, provided the rival Government does not\r\ninterfere with its establishment, a condition which is obviously\r\nimpossible. The rival Government will certainly interfere. We might\r\ncontend that we will proceed on with our work silently and quietly and in\r\nspite of governmental interference as is being done at present. A stage\r\nwill, however, be reached ultimately when action on peaceful lines will\r\nabsolutely become impossible, and then we will be forced to admit that a\r\nparallel Government can be started, but not continue to the last through\r\npeaceful means.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernmental Policy\r\n\r\nThe example of Governmental repression is before your eyes. First, it\r\nattempted through Karachi trials to prevent the Musalmans from openly\r\nproclaiming the articles of their faith, when the people, undaunted by\r\nthis decision of the Government, preached through the length and breadth\r\nof India that it was unlawful to serve in the army. The Government\r\nslowly overlooked those activities fearing lest a mere repetition of the\r\nKarachi resolution might lead to disaffection in the Army, and in order\r\nto divert the attention of the people from those activities, it\r\nsuddenly, but deliberately declared the enrollment as unlawful. That\r\nmight get an opportunity of striking at the Non-Co-operators. Like the\r\nmoths that gather to sacrifice their lives round lighted candle, the\r\nadvocates of civil disobedience swarmed to break this declaration of\r\nLord Reading and cheerfully went in their thousands to gaol. This is\r\nundoubtedly an example of self-sacrifice and self-effacement which will\r\nrightly move Mahatma Gandhi to ecstasy, but we detect another truth\r\nhidden in this demonstration of happiness and joy. It reveals to our\r\neyes the last stage of both the repression of the Government and the\r\npatience of the people. The people are, no doubt, prepared to bear and\r\nsuffer gladly the hardships of a few days of imprisonment but on the\r\ndeclaration of Martial Law the non-violent Non-Co-operation movement\r\nwill prove totally insufficient and useless. Amongst the Musalmans, at\r\nleast there will hardly be found a man who will be prepared to sacrifice\r\nhis life uselessly. A man can only have one of the two feelings in his\r\nheart, when faced by the barrel of a gun, either to seek refuge in\r\nflight or to take advantage of the law of self-preservation and despatch\r\nadversary to hell. The third alternative of cheerfully yielding up one's\r\nlife to the enemy and considering it to be the one real success will\r\nremain confined to Mahatma Gandhi and some of his adherents and fellow\r\nthinkers. I, on my part, fear that in general the reply to the Martial\r\nLaw will be what is commonly called guerilla warfare, or in the words of\r\nthe Quran \"kill them wherever you find them.\" The responsibility lies\r\nwith the representatives of the Musalmans. The members of the All-India\r\nMuslim League, should consider it their duty either to refrain from\r\nadopting Non-Co-operation as their creed or free it from the limitation\r\nof keeping it, either by violence or non-violence, for it is not in our\r\npower to keep Non-Co-operation peaceful or otherwise. So long as the\r\nGovernment confines to the use of chains and fetters, Non-Co-operation\r\ncan remain peaceful as it is to-day, but if things go further and the\r\nGovernment has recourse to gallows or machine guns it will be impossible\r\nfor the movement to remain non-violent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuty of Muslims\r\n\r\nAt this stage, some people would like to ask how is it that, while the\r\nHindus are content to adopt non-violent non-co-operation as the means\r\nfor attaining independence, that the Musalmans are anxious to go a step\r\nfurther. The answer is that the liberation of Hindustan is as much a\r\npolitical duty of Musalmans as that of a Hindu. Owing to the question of\r\nKhilafat it has become a Musalman's religious duty also.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I should like to say just one word. The glories of\r\nGhazhi Mustapha Kemal Pasha and the conclusion of the recent\r\nFranco-Turkish Treaty might create an idea in some people's minds that\r\nthe evacuation of Smyrna by the Greeks is certain, and the restoration\r\nof Thrace to the Turks if not certain is within the bounds of\r\npossibility. Consequently they might entertain the hope that the\r\nstruggle in the Near East is coming to a close. I want to warn all such\r\npeople that the claims of the Musalmans of India are founded more on\r\nreligious than political principles. So long as the Jazirat-ul-Arab\r\n(including Palestine and Mesopotamia) are not absolutely freed from\r\nnon-Muslim influence, and so long as the political and military power of\r\nthe Khilafat is not fully restored the Musalmans of India cannot suspend\r\ntheir activities and efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Muslim Demands\r\n\r\nThe Muslim demands as regards the Khilafat are these:--(1) that in the\r\npursuance of the promise of Mr. Lloyd George, Thrace and Shayrna, along\r\nwith the city of Smyrna, should remain purely under Turkish control, so\r\nthat the political status of the Khilafat Musalman, which is essential\r\nfor the Khilafat should suffer no diminution, (2) all non-Turkish\r\ncontrol should be removed from Constantinople, the shores of Marmora and\r\nthe Dardanelles in order that the Khilafat at Constantinople may not be\r\nunder non-Muslim control, which is essential for the Khilafat; (3) all\r\nnaval and military restrictions imposed on the Khilafat should be\r\nremoved, as otherwise, he would have no power to enforce the orders of\r\nthe Khilafat; (4) the Jazirat-ul-Arab, including the Hedjaz, Palestine,\r\nand Mesopotamia, should be free from all non-Muslim influence and not be\r\nunder the British mandate, as it was the death-bed injunction of the\r\nprophet. It should be noted that in the fourth demand we wish the\r\nEnglish to give up their mandate of Mesopotamia and Palestine and remove\r\ntheir influence from the Hedjaz. As to the question whether the Arabs\r\nwill acknowledge the Sheriff of Mecca or the Sultan of Turkey as their\r\nKhilafat, or whether the Arab Government of Hedjaz, Mesopotamia and\r\nPalestine will be independant or under the suzerainty of the Khilafat,\r\nthey will be decided by the Musalmans. We do not want non-Muslim advice\r\nand assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Compact Between Congress and League\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, gentlemen, the most pressing necessity of Hindustan is\r\nthe immediate conclusion of a definite compact between the Congress and\r\nthe League. The Congress should not enter into any negotiations with the\r\nGovernment concerning Swaraj (1) until the minimum Muslim demands with\r\nregard the Khilafat are satisfied; (2) on the other hand, the Muslim\r\nshould definitely bind themselves that even though their demands with\r\nregard to the Khilafat are satisfied, they, the Musalmans of India, will\r\nstand to the last by the side of their Hindu brethren for the attainment\r\nand preservation of Indian independence. Such a compact is necessary for\r\nthe work because there are signs of the enemies of Indian independence,\r\nand we have to confess with regret that a number of deceitful Indians\r\nworking with the foreigners are concentrating all their efforts to wreck\r\nthe Hindu Muslim unity and create distrust and misunderstanding between\r\nthe two communities. On the one hand, the Musalmans are being enticed by\r\nfalse hopes with regard to the Khilafat question. On the other some show\r\ntoys of political concessions are being prepared as a gift for the\r\nHindus even before the stipulated period of ten years. It is intended\r\nthat in simplicity, the Musalmans should consider the return of Smyrna,\r\netc, as the satisfaction their Khilafat demands, and slacken their\r\nefforts for the attainment of Swaraj, while the Hindus should be misled\r\ninto believing a further instalment of reforms as the Swaraj itself, or\r\nat least, its precursor and begin to consider the Khilafat as an\r\nirrelevant question. There can be only one solution for all these\r\nproblems. Hindus and Musalmans after mutual consultation, should have\r\nIndian independence declared by Mahatma Gandhi, and that in future\r\nneither the English might have an opportunity of deceiving nor India of\r\nbeing deceived. After the declaration of independence, the Congress and\r\nthe League will have only one object left; that is preservation of\r\nSwaraj. The 1st January, 1922, is the best date for the purpose because\r\nwe would thus have fulfilled the promise that we made to attain Swaraj\r\nwithin this year, and the people of India will achieve success in the\r\neyes of God and man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIX\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT REPLIES.\r\n\r\nMr. Gandhi's Misstatements.\r\n\r\n\"_Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such danger to the State that\r\nit must be met with sternness and severity._\"\r\n\r\n_So says the Government of India (Home Department) in the communique\r\npublished below in reply to Mr. Gandhi's manifesto offering a\r\npostponement of civil disobedience on certain conditions which\r\nGovernment regard as impossible._\r\n\r\n_The Government statement makes it clear that the issue is between\r\nlawlessness and the maintenance of civilised government._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manifesto issued by Mr. Gandhi on the 4th February justifying his\r\ndetermination to resort to mass civil disobedience contains a series of\r\nmisstatements. Some of these are so important that the Government of\r\nIndia cannot allow them to pass unchallenged. In the first place they\r\nemphatically repudiate the statement that they have embarked on a policy\r\nof lawless repression and also the suggestion that the present campaign\r\nof civil disobedience has been forced on the non-co-operation party, in\r\norder to secure the elementary rights of free association, free speech\r\nand of a free press. The Government of India desire to draw attention to\r\nthe fact that the decision to adopt a programme of civil disobedience\r\nwas finally accepted on the 4th November, before the recent notification\r\nrelating either to the Seditious Meetings Act or the Criminal Law\r\nAmendment Act, to which Mr. Gandhi unmistakeably refers were issued. It\r\nwas in consequence of serious acts of lawlessness, committed by persons\r\nwho professed to be followers of Mr. Gandhi and the non-co-operation\r\nmovement, that the Government were forced to take measures, which are in\r\nstrict accordance with the law for the protection of peaceful citizens\r\nin the pursuit of their lawful avocations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new and dangerous situation\r\n\r\nSince the inauguration of the non-co-operation movement the Government\r\nof India actuated by a desire to avoid anything in the nature of the\r\nrepression of political activity, even though it was of an extreme\r\ncharacter, have restricted their action in relation thereto to such\r\nmeasures as were necessary for the maintenance of law and order and the\r\npreservation of public tranquility. Up to November no steps, save in\r\nDelhi last year, were taken against the volunteer associations. In\r\nNovember, however, the Government were confronted with a new and\r\ndangerous situation. In the course of the past year, there had been\r\nsystematic attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the soldiers and the\r\npolice, and there had occurred numerous outbreaks of serious disorders,\r\ndirectly attributable to the propaganda of the non-co-operation party\r\namongst the ignorant and excitable masses. These outbreaks had resulted\r\nin grave loss of life, the growth of a dangerous spirit of lawlessness,\r\nand increasing disregard for lawful authority. In November they\r\nculminated in the grave riots in Bombay, in which 53 persons lost their\r\nlives and approximately 400 were wounded. On the same date dangerous\r\nmanifestations of lawlessness occurred in many other places, and at this\r\nperiod it became clear that many of the volunteer associations had\r\nembarked on a systematic campaign of violence, intimidation and\r\nobstruction, to combat which proceedings under the Penal Code and the\r\nCode of Criminal procedure had proved ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore drastic Measures\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Government were reluctantly compelled to\r\nresort to measures of a more comprehensive and drastic character.\r\nNevertheless, the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act was strictly\r\nlimited to a few districts in which the risk of grave disturbance of the\r\npeace was specially great, and the application of the Criminal Law\r\nAmendment Act of 1908 was confined to associations, the majority of the\r\nmembers of which had habitually indulged in violence and intimidation.\r\nIt is impossible here to set out in detail the evidence which justified\r\nthe adoption of these measures in the different provinces. Abundant\r\nproof is, however, to be found in the published proceedings of the\r\nvarious legislative bodies, in the _Communiques_ of the different local\r\nGovernments, and in the pronouncements of the heads of the provinces.\r\nWhile resolute in their determination to enforce respect for law and\r\norder and to protect loyal and peaceful subjects of the Crown, the\r\nGovernment have at the same time taken every precaution possible to\r\nmitigate where desirable the conditions of imprisonment and to avoid any\r\naction which might have the appearance of vindictive severity. Ample\r\nproof of this will be found in the orders issued by the local\r\nGovernments. Numerous offenders have been released, sentences have been\r\nreduced and special consideration has been shown in the case of persons\r\nconvicted of offences under the Seditious Meeting's Act or the Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act. There is thus no shadow of justification for the\r\ncharge that their policy has been one of indiscriminate and lawless\r\nrepression.\r\n\r\n\r\nA statement disproved\r\n\r\nA further charge, which has been brought to Mr. Gandhi is that the\r\nrecent measures of Government have involved a departure from the\r\ncivilised policy laid down by His Excellency at the time of the apology\r\nof the Ali brothers, namely, that the Government of India should not\r\ninterfere with the activities of the non-co-operators so long as they\r\nremained non-violent in word and deed. The following citation from the\r\n_communique_ of Government of India issued on the 30th May, conclusively\r\ndisproves this statement:--\r\n\r\n\"After explaining that in view of the solemn undertaking contained in\r\nthe statement over their signature it had been decided to refrain from\r\ninstituting criminal proceedings against Messrs. Mahammad Ali and\r\nShaukat Ali, the Government of India observed, it must not be inferred\r\nfrom the original determination of the Government to prosecute for\r\nspeeches inciting to violence that promoting disaffection of a less\r\nviolent character is not an offence against the law. The Government of\r\nIndia desire to make it plain that they will enforce the law relating to\r\noffences against the State, as and when they may think fit against any\r\npersons who have committed breaches of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed conference\r\n\r\nIt remains for the Government of India to deal with the allegation that\r\nHis Excellency summarily rejected the proposal for a conference,\r\nalthough the terms put forward by the conference at Bombay and accepted\r\nby the Working Committee of the Congress were quite in keeping with His\r\nExcellency's own requirements as indicated in his speech at Calcutta.\r\nHow far this is from being the case will manifest from a comparison of\r\nhis Excellency's speech with the terms proposed by the conference. His\r\nExcellency in that speech insisted on the imperative necessity, as a\r\nfundamental condition precedent to the discussion of any question of a\r\nconference of the discontinuance, of the unlawful activities of the\r\nnon-co-operation party. No assurance on this point, was, however\r\ncontained in proposals advanced by the conference. On the contrary,\r\nwhilst the Government were asked to make concessions which not only\r\nincluded the withdrawal of the notifications under the Criminal Law\r\nAmendment and Seditious Meetings Acts and the release of persons\r\nconvicted thereunder but also this release of persons convicted of\r\noffences designed to affect the loyalty of the army; and the submission\r\nto an arbitration committee of the cases of other persons convicted\r\nunder the ordinary law of the land, there was no suggestion that any of\r\nthe illegal activities of the non-co-operators other than hartals,\r\npicquetting and civil disobedience should cease. Moreover, it was\r\nevident from the statements made by Mr. Gandhi at the conference, that\r\nhe intended to continue the enrolment of volunteers in prohibital\r\nassociations and preparations for civil disobedience. Further, Mr.\r\nGandhi made also it is apparent that the proposed round table conference\r\nwould be called merely to register his decrees. It is idle to suggest\r\nthat terms of this character fulfilled in any way the essentials laid\r\ndown by His Excellency or can reasonably be described as having been\r\nmade in response to the sentiments expressed by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpossible Requests.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Government of India desire to draw attention to the demands\r\nput forward in the concluding para of Mr. Gandhi's present manifesto,\r\nwhich exceeded even the demands made by the Working Committee of the\r\nCongress. Mr. Gandhi's demands now include: (1) the release of all\r\nprisoners convicted or under trial for non-violent activities; (2) a\r\nguarantee that Government will refrain absolutely from interference with\r\nall non-violent activities of the non-co-operation party, even though\r\nthey fall within the purview of the Indian Penal Code, or in other words\r\nan undertaking that Government will indefinitely hold in abeyance in\r\nregard to the non-co-operators the ordinary and long established law of\r\nthe land. In return for these concessions he indicated that he intends\r\nto continue the illegal and seditious propaganda and operation of the\r\nnon-co-operation party and merely appears to postpone civil disobedience\r\nof an aggressive character until the offenders now in jail have had an\r\nopportunity of reviewing the whole situation. In the same paragraph he\r\nre-affirms the unalterable character of the demands of his party. The\r\nGovernment of India are confident that all right thinking citizens will\r\nrecognise that this manifesto constitutes no response whatever to the\r\nspeech of His Excellency at Calcutta and that the demands made are such\r\nas no Government could discuss, much less accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue--Law versus lawlessness\r\n\r\nThe alternatives that now confront the people of India are such as\r\nsophistry can no longer obscure or disguise. The issue is no longer\r\nbetween this or that programme of political advance, but between\r\nlawlessness with all its dangerous consequences on the one hand, and on\r\nthe other the maintenance of those principles which lie at the root of\r\nall civilised Government. Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such\r\ndanger to the State, that it must be met with sternness and severity.\r\nThe Government entertain no doubt that in any measures which they may\r\nhave to take for its suppression, they can count on the support and\r\nassistance of all law-abiding and loyal citizens of His Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XX\r\n\r\nN.C.O. RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n_Ahmedabad, December 28._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following was put by Mahatma Gandhi. \"Whereas since the holding of\r\nthe last National Congress, the people of India have found from actual\r\nexperience that by reason of the adoption of non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation the country has made great advance in fearlessness,\r\nself-sacrifice and self-respect, and whereas the movement has greatly\r\ndamaged the prestige of the Government, and, whereas, on the whole the\r\ncountry is rapidly progressing towards Swaraj, this Congress confirms\r\nthe resolution adopted at the Special session of the Congress at\r\nCalcutta and reaffirmed at Nagpur, and places on record the fixed\r\ndetermination of the Congress to continue the programme of non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation with greater vigour than hitherto, in such manner as\r\neach province may determine, till the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs are\r\nredressed and Swaraj is established, and the control of the Government\r\nof India passed into the hands of the people, from that of an\r\nirresponsible corporation, and whereas the reason of the threat uttered\r\nby his Excellency the Viceroy in recent speeches and the consequent\r\nrepression started by the Government of India, in the provinces by way\r\nof disbandment of Volunteer corps and forcible prohibition of public and\r\neven committee meetings in an illegal and high handed manner, and by the\r\narrests of many Congress workers in several provinces, and whereas this\r\nrepression is manifestly intended to stifle all Congress and Khilafat\r\nactivities and deprive the public of their assistance, this Congress\r\nresolves that all activities of the Congress be suspended, as far as\r\nnecessary, and appeals to all quietly and without any demonstration to\r\noffer themselves for arrest by belonging to the Volunteer organisations\r\nto be formed throughout the country in terms of the resolution of the\r\nWorking Committee, arrived at in Bombay, on the 23rd day of November\r\nlast, provided that no one shall be accepted as Volunteer who does not\r\nsign the following pledge:--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pledge\r\n\r\n\"With God as witness, I solemnly declare that (1) I wish to be a member\r\nof the National Volunteer Corps; (2) So long as I remain a member of the\r\nCorps, I shall remain non-violent in word and deed, and shall earnestly\r\nendeavour to be non-violent in intent, since I believe that as India is\r\ncircumstanced non-violence can help the Khilafat and the Punjab and\r\nresult in the attainment of Swaraj and consolidation of unity among all\r\nthe races and communities of India, whether Hindu, Mussalman, Sikh,\r\nParsi Christian or Jew; (3) I believe in and shall endeavour always to\r\npromote such unity; (4) I believe in Swadeshi as essential for India's\r\neconomic, political and moral salvation, and shall use handspun and\r\nhand-woven Khaddar to the exclusion of every other cloth; (5) as a\r\nHindu, I believe in the justice and necessity of removing the evil of\r\nuntouchability and shall on all possible occasions seek personal contact\r\nwith, and endeavour to render service to, the submerged classes; (6) I\r\nshall carry out the instructions of my superior officers and all the\r\nregulations not inconsistent with the spirit of this pledge prescribed\r\nby the Volunteer Boards or the Working Committee or any other agency\r\nestablished by the Congress; (7) I am prepared to suffer imprisonment,\r\nassault, or even death for the sake of my religion, and my country,\r\nwithout resentment; (8) in the event of my imprisonment, I shall not\r\nclaim from the Congress any support for my family or dependants.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolunteer corps\r\n\r\n\"This Congress trusts that every person of the age of 18 and over will\r\nimmediately join the Volunteer organisations. Notwithstanding the\r\nproclamation prohibiting public meetings, and inasmuch as even Committee\r\nmeetings have been attempted to be construed as public meetings, this\r\nCongress advises the holding of Committee meeting in enclosed places and\r\nby tickets and by previous announcements, at which as far as possible\r\nonly speakers previously announced shall deliver written speeches, care\r\nbeing taken, in every case, to avoid the risk of provocation and\r\npossible violence by the public in consequence.\r\n\r\n\"This Congress is further of opinion that Civil Disobedience is the only\r\ncivilized and effective substitute for an armed rebellion, whenever\r\nevery other remedy for preventing arbitrary, tyrannical and emasculating\r\nuse of authority by individuals or corporations, has been tried and,\r\ntherefore, advises all Congress workers and others who believe in\r\npeaceful methods and are convinced that there is no remedy save some\r\nkind of sacrifice to dislodge the existing Government from its position\r\nof perfect irresponsibility to the people of India, to organise\r\nindividual Civil Disobedience, and massed, when the mass of people have\r\nbeen sufficiently trained in the methods of non-violence, and otherwise\r\nin terms of the resolution therein of the last meeting of the All-India\r\nCongress Committee held at Delhi, this Congress is of opinion that in\r\norder to concentrate its attention upon Civil Disobedience, whether mass\r\nor individual (whether of an offensive or defensive character) under\r\nproper safeguards, and under instructions to be issued from time to time\r\nby the Working Committee or Provincial Congress Committee concerned, all\r\nother Congress activities should be suspended whenever and wherever, and\r\nto the extent to which it may be found necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMahatma the dictator\r\n\r\n\"This Congress calls upon all students of the age of 18 and over,\r\nparticularly those studying in the national institutions and the staff\r\nthereof, immediately to sign the foregoing pledge and become members of\r\nNational Volunteer Corps.\r\n\r\n\"In view of the impending arrest of a large number of Congress workers,\r\nthis Congress, whilst requiring the ordinary machinery to remain intact\r\nand to be utilised in the ordinary manner whenever feasible, hereby\r\nappoints until further instructions Mahatma Gandhi as the sole Executive\r\nauthority of the Congress and invests him with the full powers of the\r\nAll-India Congress Committee including the power to convene a special\r\nsession of the Congress or of the All-India Congress Committee or the\r\nWorking Committee, and also with power to appoint a successor in\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n\"This Congress hereby confers upon the said successor and all subsequent\r\nsuccessors appointed in turn by their predecessors, all this aforesaid\r\npower provided that nothing in this resolution shall be deemed to\r\nauthorise Mahatma Gandhi or any of the aforesaid successors to conclude\r\nany terms of peace with the Government of India or the British\r\nGovernment without the previous sanction of the All-India Congress\r\nCommittee to be finally ratified by the Congress specially convened for\r\nthe purpose, (and provided also that the present Creed of the Congress\r\nshall in no case be altered by Mahatma Gandhi or his successors except\r\nwith the leave of the Congress first obtained).\r\n\r\n\"This Congress congratulates all those patriots who are now undergoing\r\nimprisonment for the sake of their conscience or country, and realises\r\nthat their sacrifice has considerably hastened the advent of Swaraj.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XXI\r\n\r\nMr. M. K. Gandhi's Statement\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore reading his written statement Mr. Gandhi spoke a few words as\r\nintroductory remarks to the whole statement. He said: Before I read this\r\nstatement, I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned\r\nAdvocate-General's remarks in connection with my humble self. I think\r\nthat he was entirely fair to me in all the statements that he has made,\r\nbecause it is very true and I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from\r\nthis Court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the existing\r\nsystem of Government has become almost a passion with me. And the\r\nlearned Advocate-General is also entirely in the right when he says that\r\nmy preaching of disaffection did not commence with my connection with\r\n\"Young India\" but that it commenced much earlier and in the statement\r\nthat I am about to read it will be my painful duty to admit before this\r\nCourt that it commenced much earlier than the period stated by the\r\nAdvocate-General. It is the most painful duty with me but I have to\r\ndischarge that duty knowing the responsibility that rested upon my\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd I wish to endorse all the blame that the Advocate-General has thrown\r\non my shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrence, Madras\r\noccurrences, and the Chouri Choura occurrences thinking over these\r\nthings deeply, and sleeping over them night after night and examining my\r\nheart I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for me to\r\ndissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chouri Choura or the mad\r\noutrages of Bombay. He is quite right when he says that as a man of\r\nresponsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having\r\nhad a fair share of experience of this world, I should know the\r\nconsequences of every one of my acts. I knew them. I knew that I was\r\nplaying with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do\r\nthe same. I would be failing in my duty if I do not do so. I have felt\r\nit this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say all\r\nwhat I said here just now. I wanted to avoid violence. Non-violence is\r\nthe first article of my faith. It is the last article of my faith. But I\r\nhad to make my choice. I had either to submit to a system which I\r\nconsidered has done an irreparable harm to my country or incur the risk\r\nof the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the\r\ntruth from my lips. I know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am\r\ndeeply sorry for it; and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light\r\npenalty but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not\r\nplead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit to\r\nthe highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a\r\ndeliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a\r\ncitizen. The only course open to you, Mr. Judge, is, as I am just going\r\nto say in my statement, either to resign your post or inflict on me the\r\nseverest penalty if you believe that the system and law you are\r\nassisting to administer are good for the people. I do not expect that\r\nkind of conversion. But by the time I have finished with my statement\r\nyou will, perhaps, have a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to\r\nrun this maddest risk which a sane man can run.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITTEN STATEMENT\r\n\r\nI owe it perhaps to the Indian public and to the public in England to\r\nplacate which this prosecution is mainly taken up that I should explain\r\nwhy from a staunch loyalist and co-operator I have become an\r\nuncompromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator. To the court too I\r\nshould say why I plead guilty to the charge of promoting disaffection\r\ntowards the Government established by law in India.\r\n\r\nMy public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled weather. My\r\nfirst contact with British authority in that country was not of a happy\r\ncharacter. I discovered that as a man and an Indian I had no rights. On\r\nthe contrary I discovered that I had no rights as a man because I was an\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nBut I was not baffled. I thought that this treatment of Indians was an\r\nexcrescence upon a system that was intrinsically and mainly good. I gave\r\nthe Government my voluntary and hearty co-operation, criticising it\r\nfully where I felt it was faulty but never wishing its destruction.\r\n\r\nConsequently when the existence of the Empire was threatened in 1899 by\r\nthe Boer challenge, I offered my services to it, raised a volunteer\r\nambulance corps and served at several actions that took place for the\r\nrelief of Ladysmith. Similarly in 1906 at the time of the Zulu revolt I\r\nraised a stretcher-bearer party and served till the end of the\r\n'rebellion'. On both these occasions I received medals and was even\r\nmentioned in despatches. For my work in South Africa I was given by Lord\r\nHardinge a Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal. When the war broke out in 1914\r\nbetween England and Germany I raised a volunteer ambulance corps in\r\nLondon consisting of the then resident Indians in London, chiefly\r\nstudents. Its work was acknowledged by the authorities to be valuable.\r\nLastly in India when a special appeal was made at the War Conference in\r\nDelhi in 1917 by Lord Chelmsford for recruits, I struggled at the cost\r\nof my health to raise a corps in Kheda and the response was being made\r\nwhen the hostilities ceased and orders were received that no more\r\nrecruits were wanted. In all these efforts at service I was actuated by\r\nthe belief that was possible by such services to gain a status of full\r\nequality in the Empire for my countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe first shock came in the shape of the Rowlatt Act a law designed to\r\nrob the people of all real freedom. I felt called upon to lead an\r\nintensive agitation against it. Then followed the Punjab horrors\r\nbeginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating in\r\ncrawling orders, public floggings and other indescribable humiliations.\r\nI discovered too that the plighted word of the Prime Minister to the\r\nMussulmans of India regarding the integrity of Turkey and the holy\r\nplaces of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled. But in spite of the\r\nforeboding and the grave warnings of friends, at the Amritsar Congress\r\nin 1919 I fought for co-operation and working the Montagu-Chelmsford\r\nreforms, hoping that the Prime Minister would redeem his promise to the\r\nIndian Mussulmans, that the Punjab wound would be healed and that the\r\nreforms inadequate and unsatisfactory though they were, marked a new era\r\nof hope in the life of India.\r\n\r\nBut all that hope was shattered. The Khilafat promise was not to be\r\nredeemed. The Punjab crime was white-washed and most culprits went not\r\nonly unpunished but remained in service and some continued to draw\r\npensions from the Indian revenue, and in some cases were rewarded. I saw\r\ntoo that not only did the reforms not mark a change of heart, but they\r\nwere only a method of further draining India of her wealth and of\r\nprolonging her servitude.\r\n\r\nI came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection had\r\nmade India more helpless than she ever was before, politically and\r\neconomically. A disarmed India has no power of resistance against any\r\naggressor if she wanted to engage in an armed conflict with him. So much\r\nis this the case that some of our best men consider that India must take\r\ngenerations before she can achieve the Dominion status. She has become\r\nso poor that she has little power of resisting famines. Before the\r\nBritish advent India spun and wove in her millions of cottages just the\r\nsupplement she needed for adding to her meagre agricultural resources.\r\nThe cottage industry, so vital for India's existence, has been ruined by\r\nincredibly heartless and inhuman processes as described by English\r\nwitnesses. Little do town-dwellers know how the semi-starved masses of\r\nIndians are slowly sinking to lifelessness. Little do they know that\r\ntheir miserable comfort represents the brokerage they get for the work\r\nthey do for the foreign exploiter, that the profits and the brokerage\r\nare sucked from the masses. Little do they realise that the Government\r\nestablished by law in British India is carried on for this exploitation\r\nof the masses. No sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the\r\nevidence the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye. I have\r\nno doubt whatsoever that both England and the town-dwellers of India\r\nwill have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime against\r\nhumanity which is perhaps unequalled in history. The law itself in this\r\ncountry has been used to serve the foreign exploiter. My unbiased\r\nexamination of the Punjab Martial Law cases has led me to believe that\r\nat least ninety-five per cent of convictions were wholly bad. My\r\nexperience of political cases in India leads me to the conclusion that\r\nin nine out of every ten the condemned men were totally innocent. Their\r\ncrime consisted in love of their country. In ninety-nine cases out of\r\nhundred justice has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the\r\nCourt of India. This is not an exaggerated picture. It is the experience\r\nof almost every Indian who has had anything to do with such cases. In my\r\nopinion the administration of the law is thus prostituted consciously or\r\nunconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter.\r\n\r\nThe greatest misfortune is that Englishmen and their Indian associates\r\nin the administration of the country do not know that they are engaged\r\nin the crime I have attempted to describe. I am satisfied that many\r\nEnglish and Indian officials honestly believe that they are\r\nadministering one of the best systems devised in the world and that\r\nIndia is making steady though slow progress. They do not know that a\r\nsubtle but effective system of terrorism and an organised display of\r\nforce on the one hand and the deprivation of all powers of retaliation\r\nor self-defence on the other have emasculated the people and induced in\r\nthem the habit of simulation. This awful habit has added to the\r\nignorance and the self-deception of the administrators. Section 124-A\r\nunder which I am happily charged is perhaps the prince among the\r\npolitical sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the\r\nliberty of the citizen. Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by\r\nlaw. If one has no affection for a person or thing one should be free to\r\ngive the fullest expression to his disaffection so long as he does not\r\ncontemplate, promote or incite to violence. But the section under which\r\nMr. Banker and I are charged is one under which mere promotion of\r\ndisaffection is a crime. I have studied some of the cases tried under\r\nit, and I know that some of the most loved of India's patriots have been\r\nconvicted under it. I consider it a privilege therefore, to be charged\r\nunder it. I have endeavoured to give in their briefest outline the\r\nreasons for my disaffection. I have no personal ill-will against any\r\nsingle administrator, much less can I have any disaffection towards the\r\nKing's person. But I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected towards a\r\nGovernment which in its totality has done more harm to India than any\r\nprevious system. India is less manly under the British rule than she\r\never was before. Holding such a belief, I consider it to be a sin to\r\nhave affection for the system. And it has been a precious privilege for\r\nme to be able to write what I have in the various articles tendered in\r\nevidence against me.\r\n\r\nIn fact I believe that I have rendered a service to India and England by\r\nshowing in non-co-operation the way out of the unnatural state in which\r\nboth are living. In my humble opinion, non-co-operation with evil\r\nis as much a duty as is co-operation with good. But in the past,\r\nnon-co-operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the\r\nevildoer. I am endeavouring to show to my countrymen that violent\r\nnon-co-operation only multiplies evil and that as evil can only be\r\nsustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete\r\nabstention from violence. Non-violence implies voluntary submission to\r\nthe penalty for non-co-operation with evil. I am here, therefore, to\r\ninvite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be\r\ninflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears\r\nto me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you,\r\nthe Judge and the Assessors, is either to resign your posts and thus\r\ndissociate yourselves from evil if you feel that the law you are called\r\nupon to administer is an evil and that in reality I am innocent, or to\r\ninflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and\r\nthe law you are assisting to administer are good for the people of this\r\ncountry and that my activity is therefore injurious to the public weal.\r\n\r\nM.

Later, there\r\nwere a number of seditious speeches, including incitements to violence,\r\nparticularly by Mr. Muhammad Ali and his brother, and Government were\r\nprepared to take action against them. What ensued is well known to the\r\nMembers of this Assembly. There were meetings between Mr. Gandhi and His\r\nExcellency, and later Muhammad Ali and his brother offered to the public\r\ncertain undertakings on which the Government withdrew the prosecutions\r\nagainst them. In a letter of June, 1921, addressed to Local Governments\r\nafter this undertaking we indeed expressed some hope that it might be\r\npossible to reduce the number of prosecutions. We were anxious not to\r\nforce the pace and although we always maintained our determination to\r\nkeep order, we sought to avoid over-drastic action against the less\r\ndangerous or less violent adherents of the movement. At the same time we\r\nindicated to Local Governments that they were not to prosecute persons,\r\nthe prosecution of whom might have great effect outside the province,\r\nwithout consulting the Government of India. In that letter, further, we\r\ninvited Local Governments to give certain other convicted persons the\r\nsame _locus poenitentiae_ which had been given to Muhammad Ali and his\r\nbrother. We have throughout avoided very carefully any suggestion, any\r\naction which might create the impression that we desire to interfere\r\nwith a legitimate political movement. I defy any Member of this Assembly\r\nto say otherwise. We have indeed frequently been reproached with\r\nweakness on this account. I maintain that it was not weakness but\r\npatience. At the same time, we made every effort to meet the legitimate\r\nwishes of educated opinion in this country. I have no time to-day to\r\nrecapitulate all we have done but I should like to mention such matters\r\nas the compensation to persons injured in the Punjab disorders, the\r\nfurther review of the Punjab sentences, the Committee on the Press Act,\r\nthe results of which will be before this Assembly very shortly; again,\r\nthe Committee on repressive measures and the Committee to inquire into\r\nracial distinctions in criminal proceedings. In fact, there was no\r\nquestion that came before us in which we did not honestly seek to meet\r\nmoderate Members of the Assembly in order to consolidate the moderate\r\nparty into a great working power in the country for good. What has been\r\nresponse of Mr. Gandhi and his followers? I maintain that it has been\r\none steady stream of sedition, one steady attempt to subvert Government,\r\none method of promoting this object being adopted after another.\r\nSometimes it has been the boycott of piece goods in order to injure\r\nBritish trade, although Mr. Gandhi had himself I believe, at one time\r\nsaid that 'boycott' was a word that was entirely inconsistent with his\r\nprinciple of 'Ahimsa'. Later this movement took the form of attempts on\r\nthe loyalty of our troops attempts on the police and there were constant\r\nincitements to disorder. These have resulted in serious outbreaks of\r\nviolence in many parts of the country, the most important of which was\r\nthe Moplah outbreak. Sir, there has recently been some attempt to\r\nminimise the cruelties committed by the Moplahs in Malabar. I refer in\r\nparticular to the remarks of Mr. Abdul Bari and Mr. Husrat Mohani on\r\nthis subject. Mr. Abdul Bari spoke of the pure spirit of the Moplahs and\r\ndenied the veracity of the accounts of their atrocities. Mr. Husrat\r\nMohani justifies them in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"At such a critical juncture when they are engaged in war against the\r\nEnglish, their Hindu neighbours not only do not help them or observe\r\nneutrality but aid and assist the English in every possible way. They\r\ncan indeed contend that, while they are fighting a defensive war for the\r\nsake of their religion and have left their houses, property and\r\nbelongings, and taken refuge in the hills and jungles, it is unfair to\r\ncharacterise as plunder their commandeering of money, provisions and\r\nother necessities for their troops from the English and their\r\nsupporters.\"\r\n\r\nMany of us, however, have, I believe, some knowledge of the atrocities\r\ncommitted by these men, atrocities which I am certain in my mind that\r\nevery Mussalman in this House deplores as deeply as I do, and they will\r\nappreciate what a misrepresentation of the facts this is. The\r\nbarbarities of the Moplahs have been indefensible. I will cite one\r\ninstance '_New India_' in support of what I say. Writing of a\r\nrespectable Nair, an article in this paper states:\r\n\r\n'When on the 26th he threatened other steps, the rebels forced their way\r\ninto his house, dragged him out, along with his wife and two children\r\ncarried them to the mosque and bathed all four and compelled them to\r\nrecite verses from the Koran and dress as Moplahs. At mid-night they\r\nwere led home and imprisoned. Next day the deponent's head was shaved\r\nand ten days later a certain notorious criminal (now in custody)\r\nforcibly circumcised the deponent. Three weeks later he and his family\r\nand other converts (some being Christians) escaped to Shoranur.'\r\n\r\nSir, I am one of those who have been to Malabar, I have seen myself\r\nrefugees, a thousand in one refuge, hungry, homeless, lacking clothes,\r\nand I can assure Members of this Assembly that it was a pitiable sight\r\nto see. I only mention the facts because this attempt has been made and\r\nbecause this rising, these acts of cruelty and murder are one of the\r\ndirect results of the Khilafat movement. I do not put it (I never have\r\nput it) that Mr. Gandhi is responsible for this directly, but I do say\r\nthat his supporters--his Muhammadan supporters--were the cause of this\r\nterrible loss of life. Indeed you have only got to read, Mr. Hasrat\r\nMohani's speech to see what the character of the rising was. Now, if the\r\nMoplah outbreak had been an isolated instance of disorder, as I said in\r\nthe last Session, the Government might not have been forced to take\r\naction against this non-co-operation movement. It might well have been\r\nargued that the circumstances were exceptional. But have Members of this\r\nAssembly read the report which is attached to the Repressive Measures\r\nCommittee? Have they read the appendix setting out a list of 34\r\noutbreaks of disorders of a serious character within a year? Sir, we\r\nhave been told that after the declaration of policy by this Government\r\nin March last, the non-co-operation movement was dying down. I think\r\nthat I am correct in making this statement; and I hope I am not\r\nmisrepresenting anybody. Is there any foundation for it? Does not every\r\nMember of this Assembly know that that is absolutely inaccurate? Does\r\nnot every Member here know that the movement of disloyalty to the Crown,\r\nintended to paralyse Government, intended to subvert the administration,\r\nhas been growing day by day throughout the year? Can any man here say\r\nthat actually the movement was losing strength? Do not these disorders\r\ntell a different story--these outbreaks which culminated in the riots in\r\nBombay on the 17th November? Before I come to that however, I want to\r\ndeal with another point. May I inform this Assembly that, during the\r\npresent year, it has been necessary to call out the military to suppress\r\nserious disorder no less than 47 times? May I tell them that, during the\r\nlast three months, military assistance has had to be invoked--I have\r\nhere the figures from His Excellency the Commander in-Chief--no less\r\nthan 19 times? Does that look as if the forces of disorder were losing\r\nstrength before the Government took this action?\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I want to turn to the rioting in Bombay in which the\r\nlawless tendencies of those who follow Mr. Gandhi--not of Mr. Gandhi\r\nhimself--culminated. Bombay is a city in which Mr. Gandhi is supposed to\r\nexercise the greatest influence. He himself was present there on the\r\n17th November. The occasion was one, one would have thought, when at\r\nleast every loyal citizen of the Crown, whatever his political views,\r\nwould have avoided any disorder or riot. It was the occasion of the\r\nlanding of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the heir to the\r\nThrone of England. That was the occasion chosen by the non-co-operators\r\nin Bombay for an outbreak of violence which, I believe, has not been\r\nparalleled in that city for many many years, and what was the object of\r\nthose who embarked upon this campaign of violence? I say the object was\r\nvengeance, vengeance on those who dared to go forth to welcome His Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales in spite of Mr. Gandhi's direction--that\r\nwas the sole crime of the unfortunate people so maltreated. That Sir, is\r\nthe result of non-violent non-co-operation. Was Mr. Gandhi able to\r\nexercise any influence to stop the demand? Why, it was pathetic to read\r\nhis words next day. He was full of sorrow, but he had not thought of the\r\nconsequences of his act before. After all he had warning on previous\r\noccasions. Well, Sir, I do not know that I need go through the events of\r\nthese terrible days. You have heard from my Honourable friend, Mr.\r\nDwaraka Das, how women were assaulted in the public streets; you have\r\nread in the papers how harmless Europeans and Indians, including many\r\nParsis, were murdered, or assaulted, how one unfortunate engine driver,\r\ngoing home from his work, a harmless individual, was suddenly attacked\r\nand murdered by a cruel mob. All this was the result of this non-violent\r\nmovement. The reports say that it began in intimidation and that was not\r\nchecked, those who had been guilty of intimidation thought they could\r\nproceed with impunity to violence. The damage done to property also--the\r\nproperty of private individuals--was very great. I read in one report,\r\nof 137 shops being looted and that is an under statement of all the\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see what was happening in other places on that day? In Delhi\r\nthere was _hartal_ enforced by systematic threats and intimidation. And\r\nI assert here, and I dare any one to contradict me, that intimidation\r\nwas practised by men posing as volunteers; men dressed as volunteers who\r\nparaded the streets and interfered with the liberty of law-abiding\r\ncitizens in a manner that is intolerable in any civilised community. Is\r\nit surprising that we received many complaints actually of absolute want\r\nof any Government control at the time? In Calcutta, again there was\r\n_hartal_ promoted by general intimidation and violence on the part of\r\nvolunteers. It is idle for any one to deny it. Mr. Abdul Kasem and other\r\nMembers were in Calcutta and they know the facts. The Government of\r\nBengal, writing on the 26th November, reported that an incessant stream\r\nof seditious speeches was being poured forth, that money was being\r\nfreely spent in the employment of paid agents; and here I may tell the\r\nAssembly that many of these volunteers,--I do not say all of them\r\nbecause that would be wrong,--but many of these volunteers are merely\r\npaid men, paid a rupee a day, and, in fact when the supply of money\r\ndries up,--and there have been places where this has happened,--the\r\nsupply of volunteers has run short. We were also told by the Bengal\r\nGovernment that on the 17th there was general suspension of activities\r\nof all kinds and the riff-raff of the city, under the guise of\r\nvolunteers, was abroad, terrorising and abusing law-abiding folk, and\r\nthere were numerous instances of molestations of Europeans and Indians.\r\nThe authority of Government was openly flouted; and law abiding citizens\r\nwere depressed because of Government's failure to protect them, I have\r\ngot instances here of the different kinds of speeches made in Bengal. I\r\ndo not think I need cite them except to mention that one of them says:\r\n\r\n'That the Bengalees had discovered the death-arrow of the English.\r\nRemember Kanai and Khudiram Bose and others of Bengal.'\r\n\r\nI do not suppose the Members of this Assembly know who they were; they\r\nwere prominent murderers; some, if not all of them, were hanged. Well,\r\nSir, the whole effect of the activities was that, on the 17th of\r\nNovember in Calcutta there was an absolute effacement of the authority\r\nof Government, and general intimidation throughout the whole of the\r\ncity. I am told now that we exaggerated all this: There was a _hartal_,\r\nit is true, but there was nothing more than a voluntary one. Well, the\r\n_Amrita Bazar Patrika_, itself stated on the morning of the 18th a most\r\nsignificant fact--I cite it because it is testimony coming from an\r\nadversary--it said on the 18th 'Writ large on the _hartal_ of Calcutta\r\nis revolution'. Now I ask the Assembly to ponder those words.\r\n\r\nI may say that throughout all this period the most desperate efforts\r\nwere made to create racial animosity. Those who were in Calcutta in\r\nDecember last--I was there--know how true this is and it was a very\r\ndangerous factor in the situation. There was also at that time every\r\nreason to believe that if the activities of these so-called volunteers\r\nwere not curtailed, we should have a repetition in Calcutta of what we\r\nhad in Bombay. Now the total deaths in Bombay were 53 people killed, and\r\nI think something like 400 injured went to the Hospital. The problem\r\nbefore the Government, therefore, was: are you going to sit quietly, or,\r\nas my Honourable friend said, 'with folded hands' and watch with apathy\r\nand inertia this slaughter of innocent people, or are you going to take\r\naction while there is yet time? The Assembly remember also that\r\npreviously, on the 14th of November, there had been already a dangerous\r\nriot in Calcutta at Belgatchia, in which over 5,000 people had been\r\nengaged. Now, I maintain that, in such circumstances, the Bengal\r\nGovernment were fully justified in taking the action. We have abundant\r\ntestimony that, whatever be the professions of those who inaugurate\r\nthese volunteer movement, their practice and precept are poles apart.\r\nYou may say that they enter into a solemn vow of non-violence, but in\r\npractice they are repeatedly constantly and persistently, guilty of\r\nintimidation and violence. Let me turn to another province. I have got a\r\nreport here from the Bihar Government. We called for these reports to\r\nsee on what grounds they had proceeded against these associations. The\r\nreplies show that Local Governments were satisfied that the members of\r\nthe proscribed associations went in systematically for this class of\r\noffence. To return to Bihar, on the 10th of December, I received a\r\nreport from the Local Government which says that these volunteers had\r\nbeen guilty of intimidation, violence and other forms of criminal action\r\non no less than 122 occasions reported in the last year. One of the\r\nincidents is worthy of special mention, indeed many of them are. The one\r\nto which I refer was the case of a poor Muhammadan who had the\r\nmisfortune to be a law-abiding subject of the Crown. He died in Ranchi\r\nand his funeral had to be performed. But the non-co-operators said: \"No,\r\nhe shall not be buried by Muhammadans.\" Well, some over-daruni spirit\r\nsaid: 'Oh, his was not so great an offence that we should allow this\r\noppression; men who differ from other in their political views are\r\nentitled to a little toleration.' So they took the body to the graveyard\r\nwith police protection and buried it. What was the next action of the\r\nextremists? The non-co-operation volunteers dug up the corpse and\r\ndishonoured it, ('Shame.') Well that is the conduct of these non-violent\r\nnon-co-operation volunteers. Again, on the 17th in Calcutta, there were\r\nunfortunately two Muhammadans who died in Ballygunge of natural causes\r\nand those who wished to bury them could not procure the necessary\r\nassistance: they were unable to procure bearers or _Khatias_ or anything\r\nelse and the bodies remained unburied for the whole of that day. There\r\nwas many a sick man and woman in Calcutta on the 17th who could not\r\nprocure medical attendance. No conveyances for medical practitioners,\r\nand when doctors walked to the patients and attended on them, they would\r\nnot get medicine, because the dispensaries were not allowed under the\r\nstrict orders of the non-co-operators to sell medicine even to save life\r\non that day. Now, is that intimidation or is it not? I have been told\r\nthat Government interferes with the liberty of the subject in\r\nproscribing these associations. I am amazed at the audacity of those who\r\nmake such an accusation, whether it comes from the Members of this\r\nAssembly or from those who are of different political opinions, and I\r\ninclude Mr. Gandhi. Who in reality has interfered with the liberty of\r\nthe subject to the same extent as members of his party? Who is it that\r\nwill not allow those who wish to welcome the Prince to do so? Who\r\nprevents reasonable respect being shown to the dead! Who boycots and\r\nintimidates those who venture to serve the Crown or wish to sell or buy\r\nforeign piece goods? Who will not allow any member of the Assembly to\r\naddress a public meeting without interruption? ('Hear, hear'.) Who,\r\nthen, is it that is really guilty of interference with the liberty of\r\nthe subject? What extremist can make, with justice, this accusation\r\nagainst the Government? What has the Government done in this matter?...\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I wish to turn to our instructions of 24th November, in so\r\nfar as the Criminal Law Amendment Act goes. They were to the effect that\r\nwhere associations practised intimidation violence and obstruction, it\r\nwas necessary to suppress those activities and that the Act of 1908\r\nshould be used for that purpose. I believe, up to a certain point at any\r\nrate, it has been successful. What followed? A number of young men--many\r\nof them in Calcutta, hired from the mills--joined these associations as\r\nvolunteers for a money reward. Many are doing it in Delhi now and a\r\nrupee a day is the price. They join the volunteers in defiance of all\r\norders and then complain bitterly and pose as patriots, if they are\r\narrested. In Delhi, when the movement first started and arrests took\r\nplace, the authorities were anxious not to impose too severe penalties\r\non accused and the consequence was, they were sentenced simple\r\nimprisonment. Many of them were quite pleased; they were able to get\r\nfree meals and had nothing to do, so later it was found necessary to\r\nsentence others to rigorous imprisonment. At once there was a general\r\nfeeling that this was very unfair, though it was really a very natural\r\nconsequence. Throughout, however, the Government have been very anxious\r\nto avoid any appearance of undue severity; to avoid any appearance of\r\nunreasonable harshness we have made various suggestions to the Local\r\nGovernments with which I will deal later. Apart from this, however, His\r\nExcellency was never unmindful of the dangers of a purely regressive\r\npolicy and, as every Honourable Member knows he received a deputation on\r\nthe 21st December in Calcutta and listened to their views on the action\r\nof Government and the possibility of a conference between different\r\nsections of the community and Government. And I should like to read to\r\nHonourable Members one or two words from His Excellency's reply to that\r\ndeputation because, to my mind, his words breathe a lofty tone of\r\nstatesmanship and indicate a deep desire to find a solution of the\r\nproblem of all the difficulties with which the Government are faced. He\r\nspoke words over which every Member of this Assembly would do well to\r\nponder. Referring to a suggestion that Government should cease making\r\nuse of measures now enforced and release prisoners convicted under the\r\nlaw, he said:\r\n\r\n'I cannot believe that this was the intention, of the deputation, when\r\noriginally suggested, for it would mean that throughout the country\r\nintimidation and unlawful oppression and other unlawful acts should be\r\nallowed to continue, whilst Government action to maintain order and\r\nprotect the law-abiding citizen would be largely paralysed. I need\r\nscarcely tell you that no responsible Government could even contemplate\r\nthe acceptance of such a state of public affairs. I wish with all my\r\nheart, that it had been possible to deal with these problems in a large\r\nand generous spirit, worthy of such on occasion in the history of India.\r\nHad there been indications to this effect before me to-day in the\r\nrepresentations which you have made in your address on the part of the\r\nleaders of non-co-operation, had the offer been made to discontinue open\r\nbreaches of the law for the purpose of providing a calmer atmosphere for\r\ndiscussion of remedies suggested, my Government would never have been\r\nbackward in response. We would have been prepared to consider the new\r\nsituation in the same large and generous spirit I would have conferred\r\nwith Local Governments for this purpose.'\r\n\r\nSir, now what was Mr. Gandhi's reply to this? This is what Mr. Gandhi\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I am sorry that I suspect Lord Reading of complicity in the plot to\r\nunman India.'\r\n\r\nI would ask Honourable Members of this Assembly if they would take that\r\nview. He proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n'I am forced to conclude that Lord Reading is trying to emasculate India\r\nby forcibly making free speech and popular organization impossible.'\r\n\r\nIn another article he said:\r\n\r\n'I was totally unprepared for what I most respectfully call his\r\nmischievous misrepresentation of the attitude of the Congress and the\r\nKhilafat organisations in connection with the visit of His Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales.'\r\n\r\nThis country is, in truth, faced with a very grave crisis: we have civil\r\ndisobedience looming before us. We have threats of organised violence\r\nfrom an influential section of the Mussalman population. We have had\r\noutbreaks of violence of a dangerous character showing what may happen\r\nin a more extended degree in future. We have had the most terrible\r\nbloodshed and loss of life. We are face to face with a situation in\r\nwhich there may be, I fear, greater loss of life and greater bloodshed.\r\nIt is for the Assembly to say whether they are now going to encourage\r\nthe forces which make for ruin and disorder. It is for them to say\r\nwhether, consistently with their oath of allegiance to the Crown, most\r\nsolemnly sworn here, they can conscientiously and deliberately encourage\r\nthose who intend to overthrow this Government by any means that is\r\npossible. Lastly, it is for them to ponder their responsibility not only\r\nto the Assembly, not only to the Government and to the country, but also\r\nto themselves. It is for them to say whether they will take such a\r\ncourse as will facilitate a real and very grave danger to their own\r\nproperties, to their own lives, to their own honour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE TATA PRINTING WORKS, 5, THAMBU CHETTY ST., MADRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Gandhi and Anarchy, by Sir Chettur Sankaran Nair",
