SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:]\r\nThis text is an accurate reproduction of the original book with the\r\nfollowing exceptions. Obvious misspellings and typos have been corrected\r\nbut contemporary usage is unchanged, e.g. \"centre\". Sentences spanning\r\npages have been joined to facilitate searches and analysis.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to forgive the verbose style that suggests authors were\r\npaid by the word. The gems of character description and contemporary\r\nviewpoints are worth the effort.\r\n\r\nThe book supports the observation \"The news never changes, just the\r\nnames.\" I am  encouraged that the tone of politics is not much different\r\ntoday than it was at Adams' time. Things are no worse. In spite of\r\ncontinual bickering, a few persons with good will, careful planning, hard\r\nwork and a thick skin can achieve wonderful results.\r\n\r\nThe following glossary contains unfamiliar (to me) terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nabjuration\r\n  Renounce under oath; forswear.

SMITH,\r\n216 WILLIAM: STREET, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF EQUAL LIBERTY\r\n\r\nAND HUMAN RIGHTS\r\n\r\nTHROUGHOUT THE WORLD,\r\n\r\nThis Volume\r\n\r\nIS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Publishers apologize for the delay in issuing this volume, which was\r\nannounced by them as in press, more than one year since, shortly after the\r\ndecease of its illustrious subject. Gov. Seward, in undertaking its\r\npreparation, was well aware of the engrossing attention which his\r\nprofessional duties required, but looked constantly for relaxation from\r\nhis multiplied business engagements, in the hope that he might be able to\r\ncomplete the work commenced by him. It however became necessary for its\r\ntimely completion, to obtain the literary assistance of an able writer,\r\nwho has, under his auspices, completed the work. The Publishers\r\nconfidently believe, that it will in all respects, be received as a\r\nfaithful and impartial history of the Life of the \"Old Man Eloquent,\" and\r\nworthy a place in the library of every friend of liberty and humanity.\r\n  AUBURN, April, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claims of this volume are humble. For more than half a century JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS had occupied a prominent position before the American people,\r\nand filled a large space in his country's history. His career was\r\nprotracted to extreme old age. He outlived political enmity and party\r\nrancor. His purity of life--his elevated and patriotic principles of\r\naction--his love of country, and devotion to its interests--his advocacy\r\nof human freedom, and the rights of man--brought all to honor and love\r\nhim. Admiring legislators hung with rapture on the lips of \"the Old Man\r\nEloquent,\" and millions eagerly perused the sentiments he uttered, as they\r\nwere scattered by the press in every town and hamlet of the Western\r\nContinent. At his decease, there was a general desire expressed for a\r\nhistory of his life and times. A work of this description was understood\r\nto be in preparation by his family. It was not probable, however, that\r\nthis could appear under several years, and when published, would\r\nundoubtedly be placed, by its size and cost, beyond the reach of the great\r\nmass of readers. In view of these circumstances, there was an evident want\r\nof a volume of more limited compass--a book which would come within the\r\nmeans of the people generally,--and adapted not only for libraries, and\r\nthe higher classes of society, but would find its way into the midst of\r\nthose moving in the humbler walks of life. To supply this want, the\r\npresent work has been prepared. The endeavor has been made to compress\r\nwithin a brief compass, the principal events of the life of Mr. Adams, and\r\nthe scenes in which he participated; and to portray the leading traits of\r\ncharacter which distinguished him from his contemporaries. It has been the\r\naim to present such an aspect of the history and principles of this\r\nwonderful man, as shall do justice to his memory, and afford an example\r\nwhich the youth of America may profitably imitate in seeking for a model\r\nby which to shape their course through life. How far this end has been\r\nattained, an intelligent and candid public must determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe Ancestry, Birth, and Childhood of John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams studies Law--His Practice--Engages in Public Life\r\n--Appointed Minister to the Hague.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams transferred to Berlin--His Marriage--Literary Pursuits--\r\nTravels in Silesia--Negotiates Treaties with Sweden and Prussia--\r\nRecalled to the United States.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams' Return to the United States--Elected to the Massachusetts\r\nSenate--Appointed U.

He erected his\r\nhumble dwelling at a place within the present town of QUINCY, then known\r\nas MOUNT WOLLASTON, and is believed to have been an inhabitant when the\r\nfirst Christian Church was gathered there in 1630. On the organization of\r\nthe town of Braintree, which comprised the place of his residence, he was\r\nelected Clerk of the Town. He died on the eighth day of October, 1646. His\r\nmemory is preserved by a plain granite monument, erected in the\r\nburial-ground at Quincy, by JOHN ADAMS, President of the United States,\r\nand bearing this inscription:--\r\n\r\n                  In Memory\r\n                     of\r\n                 HENRY ADAMS,\r\nWho took his flight from the Dragon Persecution in Devonshire, in\r\n  England, and alighted with eight sons, near Mount Wollaston.\r\n   One of the sons returned to England, and after taking time\r\n     to explore the country, four removed to Medfield and\r\n       the neighboring towns; two to Chelmsford. One\r\n       only, Joseph, who lies here at his left hand,\r\n        remained here, who was an original pro-\r\n         prietor in the Township of Braintree,\r\n           incorporated in the year 1639.\r\n\r\nThis stone, and several others, have been placed in this yard, by a\r\ngreat-great-grandson, from a veneration of the piety, humility,\r\nsimplicity, prudence, patience, temperance; frugality, industry, and\r\nperseverance of his ancestors, in hopes of recommending an imitation of\r\ntheir virtues to their posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Adams, the son of Henry Adams mentioned in the above inscription,\r\ndied on the sixth of December, 1694, aged sixty-eight years. Joseph, the\r\nnext in succession, died February 12th, 1736, at the age of eighty-four\r\nyears. His son John Adams, was a Deacon of the Church at Quincy, and died\r\nMay 25th, 1761, aged seventy years. This John Adams was the father of him\r\nwho was destined to give not only undying fame to his ancient family, but\r\na new and powerful impulse to the cause of Human Freedom throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS, son of John Adams and Susannah Boylston Adams, was born at\r\nQuincy on the nineteenth day of October (old style), 1735. He received the\r\nhonors of Harvard University in 1755, and then, in pursuance of a good old\r\nNew England custom, which made those who had enjoyed the benefits of a\r\npublic education, in turn impart those benefits to the public, he was\r\noccupied for a time in teaching.\r\n\r\nIt ought to encourage all young men in straitened circumstances, desirous\r\nof obtaining a profession and of rising to eminence, to know that John\r\nAdams, who became so illustrious by talents and achievement as to lend\r\nrenown to the office of President of the United States, pursued the study\r\nof the law under the inconveniences resulting from his occupation as an\r\ninstructor in a Grammar School.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was an eminent and successful lawyer, but it was not the design\r\nof his existence that his talents should be wasted in the contentions of\r\nthe courts.\r\n\r\nThe British Parliament, as soon as the Colonies had attracted their\r\nnotice, commenced a system of legislation known as the Colonial System,\r\nthe object of which was to secure to the mother country a monopoly of\r\ntheir trade, and to prevent their rising to a condition of strength and\r\nindependence. The effect of this system was to prevent all manufactures in\r\nthe Colonies, and all trade with foreign countries, and even with the\r\nadjacent plantations.\r\n\r\nThe Colonies remonstrated in vain against this policy, but owing to\r\npopular dissatisfaction, the regulations were not rigidly enforced. At\r\nlength an Order in Council was passed, which directed the officers of the\r\ncustoms in Massachusetts Bay, to execute the acts of trade. A question\r\narose in the Supreme Court of that province in 1761, upon the\r\nconstitutional right of the British Parliament to bind the Colonies. The\r\ntrial produced great excitement. The cause was argued for the Crown by the\r\nKing's Attorney-General, and against the laws by James Otis.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the question thus involved was the very one that was\r\nfinally submitted to the arbitrament of arms in the American Revolution.\r\nThe speech of Otis on the occasion, was an effort of surpassing ability.\r\nJohn Adams was a witness, and he recorded his opinion of it, and his\r\nopinion of the magnitude of the question, thus:\r\n\r\n\"Otis was a flame of fire! With a promptitude of classical allusion, a\r\ndepth of research, a rapid summary of historical events and dates, a\r\nprofusion of legal authorities, a prophetic glance of his eyes into\r\nfuturity, a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence, he hurried away all\r\nbefore him. AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE was then and there born. Every man of an\r\nunusually crowded audience, appeared to me to go away ready to take up\r\narms against Writs of Assistance.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the same subject, on another occasion, John Adams said that\r\n\"James Otis there and there breathed into this nation the breath of life.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day John Adams was an enthusiast for the independence of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1764 he married Abigail, daughter of the Reverend William Smith, of\r\nWeymouth. The mother of John Quincy Adams was a woman of great beauty and\r\nhigh intellectual endowments, and she combined, with the proper\r\naccomplishments of her sex, a sweetness of disposition, and a generous\r\nsympathy with the patriotic devotion of her illustrious husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, the British Parliament, in contempt of the discontent of the\r\nColonies, presumptuously passed the Stamp Act; a law which directed taxed\r\nstamped paper to be used in all legal instruments in the Colonies. The\r\nvalidity of the law was denied; and while Patrick Henry was denouncing it\r\nin Virginia, James Otis and John Adams argued against it before the\r\nGovernor and Council of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe occasion called forth from John Adams a \"Dissertation on the Canon and\r\nFeudal Laws,\"--a work, which although it was of a general character in\r\nregard to government, yet manifested democratic sentiments unusual in\r\nthose times, and indicated that republican institutions were the proper\r\ninstitutions for the American People.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to the stamp act throughout the Colonies procured its\r\nrepeal in 1766. But the British Government accompanied the repeal with an\r\nungracious declaratory act, by which they asserted \"that the Parliament\r\nhad, and of right ought to have, power to bind the Colonies, in all cases\r\nwhatsoever.\" In the next year a law was passed, which imposed duties in\r\nthe Colonies, on glass, paper, paints, and tea. The spirit of\r\ninsubordination manifested itself throughout the Colonies, and, inasmuch\r\nas it radiated from Boston, British ships of war were stationed in its\r\nharbor, and two regiments of British troops were thrown in the town, to\r\ncompel obedience. John Adams had now become known as the most intrepid,\r\nzealous, and indefatigable opposer of British usurpation. The Crown tried\r\nupon him in vain the royal arts so successful on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. The Governor and Council offered him the place of Advocate\r\nGeneral in the Court of Admiralty, an office of great value; he declined\r\nit, \"decidedly, peremptorily, but respectfully.\"\r\n\r\nAt this interesting crisis, JOHN QUINCY ADAMS was born, at Quincy, on the\r\n11th of July, 1767. A lesson, full of instruction concerning the mingled\r\ninfluences of piety and patriotism in New England, at that time, is\r\nfurnished to us by the education of the younger Adams. Nor can we fail to\r\nnotice that each of those virtues retained its relative power over him,\r\nthroughout his long and eventful life. He was brought into the church and\r\nbaptized on the day after that on which he was born.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, in one of his letters, thus mentions the circumstances\r\nof his baptism:\r\n\r\n\"The house at Mount Wollaston has a peculiar interest to me, as the\r\ndwelling of my great-grandfather, whose name I bear. The incident which\r\ngave rise to this circumstance is not without its moral to my heart. He\r\nwas dying, when I was baptized; and his daughter, my grandmother, present\r\nat my birth, requested that I might receive his name. The fact, recorded\r\nby my father at the time, has connected with that portion of my name, a\r\ncharm of mingled sensibility and devotion. It was filial tenderness that\r\ngave the name. It was the name of one passing from earth to immortality.\r\nThese have been among the strongest links of my attachment to the name of\r\nQuincy, and have been to me, through life, a perpetual admonition to do\r\nnothing unworthy of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the character of the person from whom, in such\r\naffecting circumstances, he derived an honorable patronymic, was an object\r\nof emulation. John Quincy was a gentleman of wealth, education, and\r\ninfluence. He was for a long time Speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nin Massachusetts, and during many years one of His Majesty's Provincial\r\nCouncil. He was a faithful representative, and throughout his public\r\nservices, a vigorous defender of the rights and liberties of the Colony.\r\nExemplary in private life, and earnest in piety, he enjoyed the public\r\nconfidence, through a civil career of forty years' duration.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution was rapidly hurrying on during the infancy of John\r\nQuincy Adams. In 1769, the citizens of Boston held a meeting in which they\r\ninstructed their representatives in the Provincial Legislature to resist\r\nthe usurpations of the British Government. John Adams was chairman of the\r\ncommittee that prepared these instructions, and his associates were\r\nRichard Dana and Joseph Warren, the same distinguished patriot who gave up\r\nhis life as one of the earliest sacrifices to freedom, in the battle of\r\nBunker Hill.\r\n\r\nThose instructions were expressed in the bold and decided tone of John\r\nAdams, and they increased the public excitement in the province, by the\r\nearnestness with which they insisted on the removal of the British troops\r\nfrom Boston.\r\n\r\nThe popular irritation increased, until on the 5th of March, 1770, a\r\ncollision occurred between the troops and some of the inhabitants of\r\nBoston, in which five citizens were killed, and many wounded. This was\r\ncalled the Bloody Massacre. The exasperated inhabitants were with\r\ndifficulty restrained from retaliating this severity by an extermination\r\nof all the British troops. A public meeting was held, and a committee, of\r\nwhich SAMUEL ADAMS was chairman, was appointed to address the Governor\r\n(Gage), and demand that the troops should be withdrawn. John Adams\r\ndescribed the excitement, on a later occasion, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Not only the immense assemblies of the people from day to day, but\r\nmilitary arrangements from night to night, were necessary to keep the\r\npeople and the soldiers from getting together by the ears. The life of a\r\nred-coat would not have been safe in any street or corner of the town. Nor\r\nwould the lives of the inhabitants have been much more secure. The whole\r\nmilitia of the city was in requisition, and military watches and guards\r\nwere everywhere placed. We were all upon a level. No man was exempted: our\r\nmilitary officers were our only superiors. I had the honor to be summoned\r\nin my turn, and attended at the State House with my musket and bayonet, my\r\nbroadsword and cartridge-box, under the command of the famous Paddock.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor withdrew the troops and sent them to the castle: the\r\ncommanding officer and some of the soldiers were arrested, and brought to\r\ntrial for murder.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, the advocate and leader of the exasperated people, was\r\nsolicited by the Government to act as counsel for the accused. The people,\r\nin the heat of passion, would naturally identify the lawyer with his\r\nclients, and both with the odious cause in which they served. John Adams\r\ndid not hesitate. His principle was fidelity to duty in all the relations\r\nof life. Adams, together with Josiah Quincy, defended the accused with\r\nability and firmness, and the result crowned not only the advocates, but\r\nthe jury and the people of Boston with honor. Distinguishing between the\r\nGovernment, upon whom the responsibility rested, and the troops who were\r\nits agents, the jury acquitted the accused. The people sustained the\r\nverdict; affording to Great Britain and to the world a noble proof, that\r\nthey had been well prepared by education for the trust of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe controversy between the Province of Massachusetts and the British\r\nGovernment continued, and the exasperation of the Colonies became more\r\nintense, until the destruction of the imported tea in the harbor, in\r\nDecember, 1773, incensed the Ministry so highly, that they procured an act\r\nclosing the port of Boston. This act was followed by the convention of the\r\nfirst American Congress at Philadelphia, on the 5th of September, 1774. As\r\nJohn Adams had been the master spirit in the agitation in Massachusetts,\r\nhe was appointed one of the Delegates to the General Congress. After his\r\nelection, his friend Sewall, the King's Attorney General, labored\r\nearnestly to dissuade him from accepting the appointment.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General told the delegate that Great Britain was determined\r\non her system, that her power was irresistible, and that he, and those\r\nwith him who should persist in their designs of resistance, would be\r\ninvolved in ruin.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams replied, \"I know Great Britain has determined on her system,\r\nand that very determination determines me on mine. You know I have been\r\nconstant and uniform in opposition to her measures. The die is now cast. I\r\nhave passed the Rubicon. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish\r\nwith my country is my unalterable determination.\"\r\n\r\nIt was these energetic and resolute expressions which Daniel Webster\r\nwrought into so magnificent an imaginary speech, in his glowing Eulogy on\r\nJohn Adams and Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams continued in Congress throughout the sessions of 1775 and 1776,\r\nand on all occasions was an intrepid and earnest advocate for\r\nIndependence. On his motion, George Washington was appointed Commander in\r\nChief of the Army.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was the mover of Independence in the Congress. On the 6th of\r\nMay, 1776, he brought the subject before that body, by a resolution\r\nexpressed as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it appears perfectly irreconcilable to reason and good\r\nconscience, for the people of these Colonies now to take the oaths and\r\naffirmations necessary for the support of any government under the crown\r\nof Great Britain, and it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of\r\nauthority under the said crown should be totally suppressed, and all the\r\npowers of government exerted under the authority of the people of the\r\nColonies for the preservation of internal peace, virtue, and good order,\r\nas well as for the defence of their lives, liberties, and properties,\r\nagainst the hostile invasion, and cruel depredations of their\r\nenemies:--Therefore, it is recommended to the Colonies to adopt such a\r\ngovernment as will, in the opinion of the representatives of the people,\r\nbest conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents, and of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was adopted, and was followed by the appointment of a\r\ncommittee, on the motion of Richard Henry Lee, seconded by John Adams, to\r\nprepare a Declaration. This committee consisted of Thomas Jefferson, John\r\nAdams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston.\r\nJefferson and Adams were a sub-committee, and the former prepared the\r\nDeclaration, at the urgent request of the latter.\r\n\r\nJefferson bore this testimony to the ability and power of John\r\nAdams.--\"The great pillar of support to the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand its ablest advocate and champion on the floor of the House, was John\r\nAdams.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, he wrote the\r\nmemorable letter in which he said with prophetic unction,--\"Yesterday the\r\ngreatest question was decided that ever was debated in America; and\r\ngreater, perhaps, never was or will be decided among men. A resolution was\r\npassed without one dissenting Colony, 'That the United States are, and of\r\nright ought to be, free and independent States.' The day is passed. The\r\nfourth day of July, 1776, will be a memorable epoch in the history of\r\nAmerica. I am apt to believe it will be celebrated by succeeding\r\ngenerations as a great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated\r\nas the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to Almighty God. It\r\nought to be solemnized with pomps, shows, games, sports, guns, bells,\r\nbonfires, and illuminations, from one end of the continent to the other,\r\nfrom this time forward, forever. You may think me transported with\r\nenthusiasm, but I am not. I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and\r\ntreasure, that it will cost to maintain this Declaration, and support and\r\ndefend these States: yet through all the gloom, I can see that the end is\r\nworth all the means; and that posterity will triumph, although you and I\r\nmay rue, which I hope we shall not.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time, until November 1777, John Adams was incessantly employed\r\nin public duties in Congress, during the session of that body; and during\r\nits recess, as a member of the State Council in Massachusetts. During this\r\nperiod, John Quincy was instructed at home, by her who, in long after\r\nyears, he was accustomed to call his almost adored mother, who was aided\r\nby a law-student in the office of his father. EDWARD EVERETT, in his\r\nEulogy upon John Quincy Adams, made the very striking and just remark,\r\nthat there seemed to be in his life no such stage as that of boyhood.\r\nWhile yet but nine years old, he wrote to his father the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                                Braintree, June 2nd, 1777.\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\nI love to receive letters very well; much better than I love to write\r\nthem. I make but a poor figure at composition. My head is much too fickle.\r\nMy thoughts are running after bird's eggs, play and trifles, till I get\r\nvexed with myself. Mamma has a troublesome task to keep me a studying. I\r\nown I am ashamed of myself. I have but just entered the third volume of\r\nRollin's History, but designed to have got half through it by this time.\r\nI am determined this week to be more diligent. Mr. Thaxter is absent at\r\nCourt. I have set myself a stint this week, to read the third volume half\r\nout. If I can but keep my resolution, I may again at the end of the week\r\ngive a better account of myself. I wish, sir, you would give me in\r\nwriting, some instructions with regard to the use of my time, and advise\r\nme how to proportion my studies and play, and I will keep them by me, and\r\nendeavor to follow them.\r\n\r\nWith the present determination of growing better, I am, dear sir, your son,\r\n                                                       JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nP. S. Sir--If you will be so good as to favor me with a blank book, I will\r\ntranscribe the most remarkable passages I meet with in my reading, which\r\nwill serve to fix them upon my mind.\r\n\r\nAfter making all just allowance for precocity of genius, we cannot but see\r\nthat the early maturity of the younger Adams proves the great advantage of\r\npure and intellectual associations in childhood.\r\n\r\nThe time soon arrived when John Quincy Adams was to enjoy advantages of\r\neducation such as were never afforded to any other American youth. Among\r\nthe earliest acts of the American Congress, was the appointment of\r\nBenjamin Franklin, Silas Dean, and Arthur Lee, as Commissioners to France;\r\nthey were charged to solicit aid from France, and to negotiate a treaty,\r\nby which the Independence of the United States should be acknowledged by\r\nLouis Sixteenth, then at the height of his popularity. Silas Dean was\r\nrecalled in 1776, and John Adams was appointed to fill his place. He\r\nembarked on this mission the 13th of February, 1778, in the frigate\r\nBoston, commanded by Captain Tucker. John Adams had gone down to Quincy,\r\nand the frigate called there to receive him on board. On the eve of\r\nembarkation he wrote the following simple and touching letter to Mrs.\r\nAdams:\r\n\r\n            \"Uncle Quincy's,--half after 11 o'clock, 13 February, 1778.\r\n\"DEAREST OF FRIENDS,\r\n\"I had not been twenty minutes in this house, before I had the happiness\r\nto see Captain Tucker and a midshipman coming for me. We will be soon on\r\nboard, and may God prosper our voyage in every stage of it as much as at\r\nthe beginning, and send to you, my dear children, and all my friends, the\r\nchoicest blessings!\r\n\r\n\"So wishes and prays yours, with an ardor that neither absence, nor any\r\nother event can abate,\r\n                                                          \"JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\"P. S. Johnny sends his duty to his mamma, and his love to his sisters and\r\nbrothers. He behaves like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"He behaves like a man!\"--Words which gave presage of the future character\r\nof John Quincy Adams. His education had now commenced: an education in the\r\nprinciples of heroic action, by John Adams, the colossus of the American\r\nRevolution. How devoted he was to this important charge, and with what\r\ntrue philosophy he conducted it, may be seen by the following letter\r\nwritten about that time by him, to Mrs. Adams:\r\n\r\n\"Human nature, with all its infirmities and depravation, is still capable\r\nof great things. It is capable of attaining to degrees of wisdom and of\r\ngoodness which we have reason to believe appear respectable in the\r\nestimation of superior intelligences. Education makes a greater\r\ndifference between man and man, than nature has made between man and\r\nbrute. The virtues and powers to which men may be trained, by early\r\neducation and constant discipline, are truly sublime and astonishing.\r\n\r\n\"Newton and Locke are examples of the deep sagacity which may be acquired\r\nby long habits of thinking and study. Nay, your common mechanics and\r\nartisans are proofs of the wonderful dexterity acquired by use; a\r\nwatchmaker, finishing his wheels and springs, a pin or needle-maker, &c. I\r\nthink there is a particular occupation in Europe, which is called paper\r\nstaining, or linen staining, A man who has long been habituated to it,\r\nshall sit for a whole day, and draw upon paper various figures, to be\r\nimprinted upon the paper for rooms, as fast as his eye can roll and his\r\nfingers move, and no two of his draughts shall be alike. The Saracens, the\r\nKnights of Malta, the army and navy in the service of the English\r\nRepublic, among many others, are instances to show to what an exalted\r\nheight, valor or bravery or courage may be raised, by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\"It should be your care therefore, and mine, to elevate the minds of our\r\nchildren, and exalt their courage, to accelerate and animate their\r\nindustry and activity, to excite in them an habitual contempt of meanness,\r\nabhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, and an ambition to excel in every\r\ncapacity, faculty, and virtue. If we suffer their minds to grovel and\r\ncreep in infancy, they will grovel and creep all their lives.\r\n\r\n\"But their bodies must be hardened, as well as their souls exalted.\r\nWithout strength, and activity and vigor of body, the brightest mental\r\nexcellencies will be eclipsed and obscured.\r\n                                                        \"JOHN ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can read this extraordinary letter, and compare it with the actual\r\ncharacter of John Quincy Adams as ultimately developed, without regarding\r\nthat character as a fulfilment, in all respects, of the prayers and\r\npurposes of his illustrious parent.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the American Minister was made in a time of great peril. The\r\nnaval supremacy of Great Britain was already established. Her armed ships\r\ntraversed the ocean in all directions. Captain Tucker saw a large English\r\nship showing a row of guns, and with the consent of the Minister, engaged\r\nher. When hailed, she answered with a broadside. John Adams had been\r\nrequested to retire to the cockpit, but when the engagement had begun, he\r\nwas found among the marines, with a musket in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe desired treaty with France had been consummated by Dr. Franklin,\r\nbefore the arrival of John Adams. After that event, Congress decided to\r\nhave but one minister in that country, and Dr. Franklin having deservedly\r\nreceived the appointment, John Adams asked and obtained leave to return\r\nhome, after an absence of a year and a half. During that period the\r\nyounger Adams attended a public school in Paris, while his leisure hours\r\nwere filled with the instructions casually derived from the conversation\r\nof John Adams, and Dr. Franklin, and other eminent intellectual persons,\r\nby whom his father was surrounded. The improvement of the son during his\r\nsojourn abroad is thus mentioned by John Adams, just before his\r\nembarkation on his return to America.\r\n\r\n\"My son has had a great opportunity to see this country, but this has\r\nunavoidably retarded his education in some other things. He has enjoyed\r\nperfect health from first to last, and is respected wherever he goes, for\r\nhis vigor and vivacity both of mind and body; for his constant good humor,\r\nand for his rapid progress in French, as well as in general knowledge,\r\nwhich, for his age, is uncommon.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams now regarded his public life as closed. He wrote to Mrs. Adams:\r\n\r\n\"The Congress, I presume, expect that I should come home, and I shall come\r\naccordingly. As they have no business for me in Europe, I must contrive to\r\nget some for myself at home. Prepare yourself for removing to Boston, into\r\nthe old house, for there you shall go, and I will draw writs and deeds,\r\nand harangue juries, and be happy.\"\r\n\r\nThis calculation was signally erroneous, as all calculations upon personal\r\nease and peace by great and good men always are. He remained at home only\r\nthree months, and during that time he had other and higher occupations\r\nthan drawing writs and deeds. He was elected Delegate to the Convention\r\ncharged with the responsible and novel duty of forming a written\r\nconstitution for Massachusetts. In that body he labored with untiring\r\nassiduity, as in Congress; the constitution thus produced was in a great\r\nmeasure prepared by himself, and it is due to his memory to record the\r\nfact, that it was among the most democratic of all the constitutions which\r\nwere adopted by the new States. The younger Adams having returned to\r\nAmerica with his father, had thus the advantage of seeing republican\r\ntheories brought into successful, practical application.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Congress resolved on sending a Minister Plenipotentiary to\r\nGreat Britain, to negotiate, if possible, a treaty of peace. John Adams\r\nand John Jay received each an equal number of votes. The result was the\r\nappointment of M. Jay as Minster to Spain, and of John Adams as Minister\r\nto the Court of St. James. He was instructed to insist on the independence\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe younger Adams again attended the Diplomatist. They embarked in the\r\nFrench frigate La Sensible, on the 17th of November, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe frigate sprang a leak, and was obliged to put into the port nearest at\r\nhand, which proved to be Ferrol in Spain. They disembarked on the 11th of\r\nDecember, and traversed the intervening distance to Paris over land, a\r\njourney of a thousand miles. This journey was performed through the\r\nmountains on mules. Spain, as well as France, was then in alliance with\r\nAmerica, and the minister was everywhere received with respect and\r\nkindness. The French officers at Ferrol wore cockades in honor of the\r\nTriple Alliance, combining a white ribbon for the French, a red one for\r\nthe Spanish, and a black one for the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe United Powers proposed demands which were ominous of disappointment to\r\nthe Minister.--On the 12th of December he wrote:--\"It is said that England\r\nis as reluctant to acknowledge the independence of America, as to cede\r\nGibraltar, the last of which is insisted upon, as well as the first.\"\r\n\r\nThe travellers reached Paris about the middle of February, 1780. John\r\nAdams mentioned a singular coincidence in his letter announcing their\r\narrival. \"I have the honor to be lodged here with no less a personage than\r\nthe Prince of Hesse-Cassel, who is here upon a visit. We occupy different\r\napartments in the same house, and have no intercourse with each other, to\r\nbe sure; but some wags are of opinion, that if I were authorised to open\r\na negotiation with him, I might obtain from him as many troops to fight on\r\nour side of the question, as he has already hired to the English against\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution has wrought wonderful changes since that day. No\r\nGerman Prince could now send a man, or a musket, to war against its\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams soon discovered that there was no prospect of success for his\r\nmission to England. He remained at Paris until August, 1780, and during\r\nthe interval his son was kept at an academy in that city.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of that period the Minister repaired to Holland, and\r\nthere received instructions to negotiate a loan, and then a treaty of\r\namity and commerce with the states of that country. The younger Adams\r\nwhile in Holland was placed at school, first at Amsterdam, and afterwards\r\nin the University of Leyden.\r\n\r\nA letter of the father, dated at Amsterdam, 18th December, 1780, gives us\r\na glimpse of the system of instruction approved by him, and a pleasant\r\nview of the principles which he deemed it important to be inculcated.\r\n\r\n\"I have this morning sent Mr. Thaxter with my two sons to Leyden, there\r\nto take up their residence for some time, and there to pursue their\r\nstudies of Latin and Greek under the excellent masters, and there to\r\nattend lectures of the celebrated professors in that University. It is\r\nmuch cheaper there than here. The air is infinitely purer, and the company\r\nand conversation are better. It is perhaps as learned a University as any\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\n\"I should not wish to have children educated in the common schools of this\r\ncountry, where a littleness of soul is notorious. The masters are mean\r\nspirited wretches, pinching, kicking, and boxing the children upon every\r\nturn. There is, besides, a general littleness, arising from the incessant\r\ncontemplation of stivers and doits, which pervades the whole people.\r\n\r\n\"Frugality and industry are virtues everywhere, but avarice and stinginess\r\nare not frugality. The Dutch say, that without a habit of thinking of\r\nevery doit before you spend it, no man can be a good merchant, or conduct\r\ntrade with success.\r\n\r\n\"This, I believe, is a just maxim in general; but I would never wish to\r\nsee a son of mine govern himself by it. It is the sure and certain way for\r\nan industrious man to be rich. It is the only possible way for a merchant\r\nto become the first merchant, or the richest man in the place. But this is\r\nan object that I hope none of my children will ever aim at. It is indeed\r\ntrue everywhere, that those who attend to small expenses are always rich.\r\n\r\n\"I would have my children attend to doits and farthings as devoutly as\r\nthe merest Dutchman upon earth, if such attention was necessary to support\r\ntheir independence. A man who discovers a disposition and a design to be\r\nindependent, seldom succeeds. A jealousy arises against him. The tyrants\r\nare alarmed on the one side, lest he should oppose them: the slaves are\r\nalarmed on the other, lest he should expose their servility. The cry from\r\nall quarters is, 'He is the proudest man in the world: He cannot bear to\r\nbe under obligation.'\r\n\r\n\"I never in my life observed anyone endeavoring to lay me under particular\r\nobligation to him, but I suspected he had a design to make me his\r\ndependent, and to have claims upon my gratitude. This I should have no\r\nobjection to, because gratitude is always in one's power. But the danger\r\nis, that men will expect and require more of us than honor, and innocence,\r\nand rectitude will permit us to perform.\r\n\r\n\"In our country, however, any man, with common industry and prudence, may\r\nbe independent.\"\r\n\r\nOne cannot turn over a page of the domestic history of John Adams, without\r\nfinding a precept or example, the influence of which is manifested in the\r\ncharacter of his illustrious son. Thus he writes to Mrs. Adams, touching\r\ncertain calumnies which had been propagated against him:--\r\n\r\n  LIFE OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.   39\r\n\r\n\"Do n't distress yourself about any malicious attempts to injure me in\r\nthe estimation of my countrymen. Let them take their course, and go the\r\nlength of their tether. They will never hurt your husband, whose character\r\nis fortified with a shield of innocence and honor, ten thousand-fold\r\nstronger than brass or iron. The contemptible essays, made by you know\r\nwhom, will only tend to their own confusion. My letters have shown them\r\ntheir own ignorance, a sight they could not bear. Say as little about it\r\nas I do. I laugh, and will laugh before all posterity, at their impotent\r\nrage and envy.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1781, Francis Dana, who had attended John Adams as Secretary of\r\nLegation, was appointed Minister to Russia. John Quincy Adams, then\r\nfourteen years old, was appointed Private Secretary of this mission. He\r\nremained at that post fourteen months, performing its duties with entire\r\nsatisfaction to the minister. The singular ripeness of the youthful\r\nsecretary was shown in his travelling alone, on his return from St.\r\nPetersburgh, by a journey leisurely made, and filled with observations of\r\nSweden, Denmark, Hamburgh, and Bremen. On arriving in Holland, he resumed\r\nhis studies at the Hague.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, having completed his mission in Holland, was soon charged,\r\ntogether with Dr. Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, with the duty of\r\nnegotiating a definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain. The treaty\r\nwas executed at Paris on the 30th of November, 1783, and was ratified\r\nJanuary 14th, 1784. The younger Adams enjoyed the satisfaction of being\r\npresent at the conclusion of the treaty; and while it was under process of\r\nnegotiation, he was constantly favored with opportunities of listening to\r\nthe instructive conversation of Franklin and Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of the treaty was dilatory in the extreme. It was\r\nembarrassed with French intrigues, great carelessness at home, and greater\r\nreluctance on the part of England. The wearied Minister wrote to Mrs.\r\nAdams on the 30th of May, 1783: \"Our son is at the Hague, pursuing his\r\nstudies with great ardor. They give him a good character wherever he has\r\nbeen, and I hope he will make a good man.\" On the 9th of June he wrote in\r\nthese homely, but manly words:  \"I am weary, worn, and disgusted to death.\r\nI had rather chop wood, dig ditches, and make fence upon my poor little\r\nfarm. Alas, poor farm! and poorer family! what have you lost that your\r\ncountry might be free! and that others might catch fish and hunt deer and\r\nbears at their ease!\r\n\r\n\"There will be as few of the tears of gratitude, or the smiles of\r\nadmiration, or the sighs of pity for us, as for the army. But all this\r\nshould not hinder me from going over the same scenes again, upon the same\r\noccasions--scenes which I would not encounter for all the wealth, pomp,\r\nand power of the world. Boys! if you ever say one word, or utter one\r\ncomplaint, I will disinherit you. Work! you rogues, and be free.  You will\r\nnever have so hard work to do as papa has had. Daughter! get you an honest\r\nman for a husband, and keep him honest. No matter whether he is rich,\r\nprovided he be independent. Regard the honor and the moral character of\r\nthe man, more than all circumstances. Think of no other greatness but that\r\nof the soul, no other riches but those of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nAfter concluding the treaty of peace, John Adams, together with Franklin\r\nand Jay, was charged with the duty of negotiating a treaty of commerce\r\nwith Great Britain, and John Adams, taking his son John Quincy with him,\r\nproceeded to London, and took up his residence at the British Court. Mrs.\r\nAdams embarked in June, 1781, to join her husband.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the same Court in\r\n1785, and thus he, who ten years before, when a subject, in the province\r\nof Massachusetts, had said, \"I know that Great Britain has determined upon\r\nher system, and that very determination determines me on mine,\"--was the\r\nfirst Representative of his independent country admitted to an audience by\r\nthe discomfited majesty of the Imperial States. The occasion was adapted\r\nto excite profound emotions, though of different kinds, in each party.\r\nJohn Adams addressed the King thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The United States of America have appointed me their Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to your Majesty, and have directed me to deliver to your\r\nMajesty this letter, which contains the evidence of it.  It is in\r\nobedience to their express commands, that I have the honor to assure your\r\nMajesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the most\r\nliberal and friendly intercourse between your Majesty's subjects and their\r\ncitizens; and of their best wishes for your Majesty's health and\r\nhappiness, and for that of your royal family.\r\n\r\n\"The appointment of a Minister from the United States to your Majesty's\r\nCourt, will form an epoch in the history of England and of America. I\r\nthink myself more fortunate than all my fellow citizens, in having the\r\ndistinguished honor to be the first to stand in your Majesty's royal\r\npresence, in a diplomatic character; and I shall esteem myself the\r\nhappiest of men, if  I can be instrumental in recommending my Country more\r\nand more, to your Majesty's royal benevolence, and of restoring an entire\r\nesteem, confidence and affection, or in better words, 'the old good\r\nnature, and the old good harmony,' between people, who, though separated\r\nby an ocean, and under different governments, have the same language, a\r\nsimilar religion, and kindred blood. I beg your Majesty's permission to\r\nadd, that although I have sometimes before been intrusted by my country,\r\nit was never, in my whole life, in a manner so agreeable to myself.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge III. replied with dignity, but not without some manifestations of\r\nexcitement:--\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary, the language you\r\nhave now held is so extremely proper, and the feelings you have discovered\r\nso justly adapted to the occasion, that I must say that I not only receive\r\nwith pleasure the assurances of the friendly disposition of the People of\r\nthe United States, but I am very glad the choice has fallen upon you to be\r\ntheir Minister. I wish you, sir, to believe, and that it may be understood\r\nin America, that I have done nothing in the late contest, but what I\r\nthought myself indispensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed my\r\npeople. I will be frank with you--I was the last to conform to the\r\nseparation, but the separation having been made, and having become\r\ninevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to\r\nmeet the friendship of the United States, as an independent power.\r\n\r\n\"The moment I see such sentiments and language as yours prevail, and a\r\ndisposition to give this country the preference, that moment I shall say,\r\nlet the circumstances of language, religion and blood have their natural\r\nand full effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe kindly feelings expressed by the King, were, however, comparatively,\r\nonly the language of ceremony, for the British Ministry, and the British\r\npeople, did not regard the new republic with favor. But they could not\r\nwithhold the exhibition of reluctant respect.\r\n\r\nIt was at such a time as this, and in such circumstances, that John Quincy\r\nAdams surveyed, from a new position, the colossal structure of British\r\npower, and the workings of its combined systems of conservative\r\naristocracy, and progressive democracy. It was here that he imbibed new\r\nveneration for Russell, Sidney, Hampden, and Milton, its republican\r\npatriots; for Shakspeare, Dryden, and Pope, its immortal poets; and for\r\nAddison and Johnson, its moralists; here he learned from Wilberforce the\r\nprinciples of political philanthropy, as well as the patience and\r\nperseverance to defend them, and studied eloquence by the living models of\r\nPitt, Fox, Erskine, Burke, and Sheridan.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a fitting conclusion to a precocious education by the\r\npatriots and philosophers of his own country, with practical observations\r\nin the courts of Spain and the Netherlands, of the weak but amiable Louis\r\nXVI., and the accomplished, but depraved, Catharine II.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams now became fearful that the duties of manhood would\r\ndevolve upon him without his having completed the necessary academic\r\nstudies. He therefore obtained leave to return home in 1785, at the age of\r\neighteen years, and entered Cambridge University, at an advanced standing,\r\nin 1786. He graduated in 1788 with deserved honors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS STUDIES LAW--HIS PRACTICE--ENGAGES IN PUBLIC\r\nLIFE--APPOINTED MINISTER TO THE HAGUE.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the University, young Adams entered the office of\r\nTheophilus Parsons, who was then in the practice of law at Newburyport,\r\nand who afterwards for so many years filled with dignity and ability the\r\noffice of Chief Justice of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAdams completed the usual term of professional study, and then commenced\r\nthe practice of the law in Boston. It may encourage some who are oppressed\r\nby the difficulties attending initiation in the profession, to know, that\r\nduring the first and only four years of John Quincy Adams' practice, he\r\nhad occasion for despondency.\r\n\r\n\"I had long and lingering anxieties, (he afterwards said,) in looking\r\nforward, doubtful even of my prospects of comfortable subsistence, but\r\nacquiring more and more the means of it, till in the last of the four\r\nyears, the business of my profession yielded me an income more than equal\r\nto my expenditures.\"\r\n\r\nBut the country and the age had claims on John Quincy Adams, as well as on\r\nhis father, for higher duties than \"making writs,\" and \"haranguing\r\njuries,\" and \"being happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution, which had been brought to a successful close, had\r\ninspired, throughout Europe, a desire to renovate the institutions of\r\ngovernment. The officers and citizens of France who had mingled in the\r\ncontest, had carried home the seeds of freedom, and had scattered them\r\nabroad upon soil quick to receive them. The flame of Liberty, kindled on\r\nthe shores of the Western Continent, was reflected back upon the Old\r\nWorld. France beheld its beams, and hailed them as a beacon-light, which\r\nshould lead the nations out from the bondage of ages. Inspirited by the\r\nsuccess attending the struggle in the British colonies, the French people,\r\nlong crushed beneath a grinding despotism, resolved to burst their\r\nshackles and strike for Freedom. It was a noble resolution, but\r\nconsummated, alas amid devastation and the wildest anarchy. The French\r\nRevolution filled the world with horror. It was the work of a blind giant,\r\nurged to fury by the remembrance of wrongs endured for generations. The\r\nAltar of Liberty was reared amid seas of blood, and stained with the gore\r\nof innocent victims.\r\n\r\nThe measurable failure of this struggle in France, teaches the necessity\r\nof due preparation before a people can advance to the permanent possession\r\nand enjoyment of their rights. The American colonists had been trained to\r\nrational conceptions of freedom, by lessons of wisdom and sagacity read\r\nthem by their Puritan fathers, and by the experience in self-government,\r\nafforded during a century and a half of enjoyment of a large share of\r\npolitical privileges, granted by the mother country. They were thus\r\nprepared to lay deep and strong the foundations of an enlightened\r\ngovernment, which, equally removed from the extremes of despotism on the\r\none hand, and anarchy on the other, and granting its subjects the exercise\r\nof their right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" shall\r\nendure through ages to come. But the people of France, shut up in darkness\r\nduring centuries of misrule, passed at a step from abject servitude to\r\nunlimited freedom. They were unprepared for this violent transition. Their\r\nconceptions of liberty were of the most extravagant description. What\r\nwonder that they became dizzy at their sudden elevation! What wonder that\r\nblood flowed in rivers!--that dissension and faction rent them asunder--\r\nthat a fearful anarchy soon reigned triumphant--or that the confused and\r\ntroubled drama closed in the iron rule of a military conqueror--the Man of\r\nDestiny! Let not this lesson be lost upon the world. Let a people who\r\nwould enjoy freedom, learn to merit the boon by the study of its\r\nprinciples and a preparation to exercise its privileges, under those\r\nsalutary restraints which man can never throw off and be happy!\r\n\r\nThe odium excited throughout Europe by the excesses of the French\r\nRevolution, was heaped without measure upon the American people. They were\r\ncharged with the origin of the misrule which convulsed France, and filled\r\nthe eastern hemisphere with alarm: and were tauntingly pointed to the\r\ncrude theories promulgated by French democracy, and the failure of their\r\nphrenzied efforts to establish an enlightened and permanent Republic, as\r\nconclusive evidence that self-government, among any people, was a mere\r\nUtopian dream, which could never be realized.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a republican government in America, had not been\r\nrelished by the monarchies of Europe. They looked upon it with distrust,\r\nas a precedent dangerous to them in the highest degree. The succor which\r\nLouis XVI. had rendered the revolting colonists, was not from a love of\r\ndemocratic institutions: it was his hope to cripple Great Britain, his\r\nancient enemy, and to find some opportunity, perhaps, to win back his\r\nCanadian provinces, which had so recently been rent from his possession.\r\nWhen the pent-up flames of revolution burst forth at the very doors of the\r\ngovernments of the old world--when the French throne had been robbed of\r\nits king, and that king of his life--when a Republic had been proclaimed\r\nin their midst, and signal-notes of freedom were ringing in their\r\nborders--they became seriously alarmed. The growing evil must be checked\r\nimmediately. Led on by England, the continental powers combined to\r\nexterminate at a blow, if possible, every vestige of Republicanism in\r\nFrance. Then commenced the long series of bloody wars, which, with little\r\nintermission, convulsed Europe for nearly a quarter of a century, and\r\nceased only when the rock of St. Helena received its lonely exile.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime affairs at home had attained to a critical juncture. The\r\nConstitution had been adopted. The new government had been set in\r\noperation under the supervision of Washington, as the first President of\r\nthe Republic. The people, influenced by certain \"elective affinities,\" had\r\nbecome sundered into two great political parties--Conservative and\r\nProgressive, or Federal and Democratic. Both were distrustful of the\r\nConstitution. The former believed it too weak to consolidate a government\r\ncapable of protecting its subjects in the peaceful enjoyment of their\r\nrights, from discord within, and attacks from without. The latter\r\napprehended that it might easily be transformed, by some ambitious\r\nNapoleon, into an instrument of oppression, more fearful even than the\r\nlimited monarchy from which they had but recently escaped, at an expense\r\nof so much blood and treasure. Each of these parties are entitled to the\r\ncredit of equal sincerity and honesty of purpose.\r\n\r\nWashington, with a loftiness of purpose truly characteristic of a great\r\nand good mind, refused to identify himself with either party. In forming\r\nhis first cabinet, moved with a desire to heal the dissensions which\r\ndistracted the country, he selected its members equally from the adverse\r\nfactions. Hamilton and Knox represented the Federal party, and Jefferson\r\nand Randolph the opposite. During his entire administration, \"the Father\r\nof his country\" steadily aimed to keep himself clear from all party\r\nentanglements. He was emphatically the President of the whole people, and\r\nnot of a faction. His magnanimous spirit would not stoop to party\r\nfavoritism, nor allow him to exercise the power entrusted him, to promote\r\nthe interests of any political clique. In all his measures his great\r\nobject was to advance the welfare of the nation, without regard to their\r\ninfluence on conflicting parties. In these things he left behind him a\r\npure and noble example, richly worthy the imitation of his successors in\r\nthat high station.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in France, and the measures adopted by the Allied\r\nSovereigns to arrest its progress, excited the liveliest interest among\r\nthe people of the United States. But their sympathies ran in different\r\nchannels, and very naturally took the hue of their party predilections.\r\nThe Democrats, believing the French Revolution to be the up-springing of\r\nthe same principles which had triumphed here--a lawful attempt of an\r\noppressed people to secure the exercise of inalienable rights--although\r\nshuddering at the excesses which had been perpetrated, still felt it to be\r\nour own cause, and insisted that we were in honor and duty bound to render\r\nall the assistance in our power, even to a resort to arms, if need be. The\r\nFederalists, on the other hand, were alarmed at the anarchical tendencies\r\nin France. They were fearful that law, order, government, and society\r\nitself, would be utterly and speedily swept away, unless the revolutionary\r\nmovement was arrested. Cherishing these apprehensions, they were disposed\r\nto favor the views of Great Britain and other European powers, and were\r\nanxious that the government of the United States should adopt some active\r\nmeasures to assist in checking what they could not but view as rapid\r\nstrides to political and social anarchy. However the two parties differed\r\nas to the measures proper to be adopted in this crisis, they were united\r\nin the conviction that our government should take some part as a\r\nbelligerant, in these European struggles; and exerted each its influence\r\nto bring about such an interference as would be in accordance with their\r\nconflicting views of duty and expediency.\r\n\r\nThere was residing, at this period, in Boston, a young and nearly\r\nbriefless lawyer, whose views on these important matters differed\r\nmaterially from those entertained by both parties. It was John Quincy\r\nAdams. While he could not countenance the attempts of the Allied Powers to\r\ndestroy the French Republic, and re-establish a monarchy, he was equally\r\nfar from favoring the turn which affairs were clearly taking in that\r\nunhappy country. He evidently foresaw the French Revolution would prove a\r\nfailure; and that it was engendering an influence which, unchecked, would\r\nbe deeply injurious to American liberty and order. To counteract this\r\ntendency, he published in the Boston Centinel, in 1791, a series of\r\narticles, signed \"Publicola,\" in which he discussed with great ability,\r\nthe wild vagaries engendered among political writers in France, and which\r\nhad been caught up by many in our own country. These articles attracted\r\nmuch attention, both at home and abroad. They were re-published in\r\nEngland, as an answer to several points in Paine's \"Rights of Man.\" So\r\nprofound was the political sagacity they displayed, and so great the\r\nfamiliarity with public affairs, that they were, by general consent,\r\nattributed to the elder Adams. On this subject, John Adams writes his wife\r\nas follows, from Philadelphia, on the 5th December, 1793:--\r\n\r\n\"The Viscount Noailles called on me. * * * * He seemed very critical in\r\nhis inquiries concerning the letters printed as mine in England. I told\r\nhim candidly that I did not write them, and as frankly, in confidence, who\r\ndid. He says they made a great impression upon the people of England; that\r\nhe heard Mr. Windham and Mr. Fox speak of them as the best thing that had\r\nbeen written, and as one of the best pieces of reasoning and style they\r\nhad ever read.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger Adams, in surveying the condition of the country at this\r\ncritical period, became convinced it would be a fatal step for the new\r\ngovernment to take sides with either of the great parties in Europe, who\r\nwere engaged in the settlement of their difficulties by the arbitrement\r\nof arms. However strongly our sympathies were elicited in behalf of the\r\nFrench Republic--however we may have been bound in gratitude for the\r\nassistance rendered us during our Revolutionary struggle, to co-operate\r\nwith France in her defence of popular institutions--still,\r\nself-preservation is the first law of nature. Mr. Adams saw, that to throw\r\nourselves into the melee of European conflicts, would prostrate the\r\ninterests of the country, and peril the very existence of the government.\r\n\r\nThese views he embodied in a series of articles, which he published in the\r\nBoston Centinel, in 1793, under the signature of \"Marcellus.\" He\r\ninsisted it was alike the dictate of duty and policy, that the United\r\nStates should remain strictly neutral between France and her enemies.\r\nThese papers attracted general attention throughout the Union, and made a\r\nmarked impression on the public mind. They were read by Washington, with\r\nexpressions of the highest satisfaction; and he made particular inquiries\r\nrespecting the author.\r\n\r\nThe position of Mr. Adams on neutrality was new, and in opposition to the\r\nopinions of the great mass of the country. To him, it is believed, belongs\r\nthe honor of first publicly advocating this line of policy, which\r\nafterwards became a settled principle of the American government.\r\nNon-interference with foreign affairs is a principle to which the Union\r\nhas rigidly adhered to the present hour. In these articles too, Mr. Adams\r\ndeveloped the political creed which governed him through life in regard to\r\ntwo great principles--union at home and independence of all foreign\r\nalliances or entanglements--independence not only politically, but in\r\nmanufactures and in commerce.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of April, 1793, Washington issued a proclamation, announcing\r\nthe neutrality of the United States between the belligerent nations of\r\nEurope. This proclamation was not issued until after Mr. Adams's articles\r\nurging this course had been before the public for some time. It is an\r\nhonorable testimony to the sagacity of his views, that Washington, and the\r\neminent men composing his cabinet, adopted a policy which coincided so\r\nperfectly with opinions he had formed purely from the strength of his own\r\nconvictions. The proclamation pleased neither of the belligerent nations\r\nin Europe. It aroused the enmity of both; and laid open our commerce to\r\nthe depredations of all parties, on the plea that the American government\r\nwas inimical to their interests.\r\n\r\nWhile in the practice of law in Boston, Mr. Adams was not well satisfied\r\nwith his condition or prospects. That he was laudably ambitious to arise\r\nto distinction in some honorable line is quite certain. But, singular as\r\nit may appear at this day, in view of his early life, and his acknowledged\r\ntalents, he was not looking for, nor expecting, political preferment.\r\nThese facts appear in the following passages from his diary, written at\r\nthat time; and which, moreover, will be found to contain certain rules of\r\naction for life, which the young men of our country should studiously seek\r\nto imitate.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, May 16th, 1792. I am not satisfied with the manner in which I\r\nemploy my time. It is calculated to keep me forever fixed in that state of\r\nuseless and disgraceful insignificancy, which has been my lot for some\r\nyears past. At an age bearing close upon twenty-five, when many of the\r\ncharacters who were born for the benefit of their fellow-creatures have\r\nrendered themselves conspicuous among their cotemporaries, and founded a\r\nreputation upon which their memory remains, and will continue to the\r\nlatest posterity--at that period, I still find myself as obscure, as\r\nunknown to the world, as the most indolent, or the most stupid of human\r\nbeings. In the walks of active life I have done nothing. Fortune, indeed,\r\nwho claims to herself a large proportion of the merit which exhibits to\r\npublic view the talents of professional men, at an early period of their\r\nlives, has not hitherto been peculiarly indulgent to me. But if to my own\r\nmind I inquire whether I should, at this time, be qualified to receive and\r\nderive any benefit from an opportunity which it may be in her power to\r\nprocure for me, my own mind would shrink from the investigation. My heart\r\nis not conscious of an unworthy ambition; nor of a desire to establish\r\neither fame, honor, or fortune upon any other foundation than that of\r\ndesert. But it is conscious, and the consideration is equally painful and\r\nhumiliating, it is conscious that the ambition is constant and unceasing,\r\nwhile the exertions to acquire the talents which ought alone to secure the\r\nreward of ambition, are feeble, indolent, frequently interrupted, and\r\nnever pursued with an ardor equivalent to its purposes. My future fortunes\r\nin life are, therefore, the objects of my present speculation, and it may\r\nbe proper for me to reflect further upon the same subject, and if\r\npossible, to adopt some resolutions which may enable me, as uncle Toby\r\nShandy said of his miniature sieges, to answer the great ends of my\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"First, then, I begin with establishing as a fundamental principle upon\r\nwhich all my subsequent pursuits and regulations are to be established,\r\nthat the acquisition, at least, of a respectable reputation is (subject to\r\nthe overruling power and wisdom of Providence,) within my own power; and\r\nthat on my part nothing is wanting, but a constant and persevering\r\ndetermination to tread in the steps which naturally lead to honor. And, at\r\nthe same time, I am equally convinced, that I never shall attain that\r\ncredit in the world, which my nature directs me to wish, without such a\r\nsteady, patient, and persevering pursuit of the means adapted to the end I\r\nhave in view, as has often been the subject of my speculation, but never\r\nof my practice.\r\n\r\n 'Labor and toil stand stern before the throne,\r\n  And guard--so Jove commands--the sacred place.'\r\n\r\n\"The mode of life adopted almost universally by my cotemporaries and\r\nequals is by no means calculated to secure the object of my ambition. My\r\nemulation is seldom stimulated by observing the industry and application\r\nof those whom my situation in life gives me for companions. The pernicious\r\nand childish opinion that extraordinary genius cannot brook the slavery of\r\nplodding over the rubbish of antiquity (a cant so common among the\r\nheedless votaries of indolence), dulls the edge of all industry, and is\r\none of the most powerful ingredients in the Circean potion which\r\ntransforms many of the most promising young men into the beastly forms\r\nwhich, in sluggish idleness, feed upon the labors of others. The\r\ndegenerate sentiment, I hope, will never obtain admission in my mind; and,\r\nif my mind should be loitered away in stupid laziness, it will be under\r\nthe full conviction of my conscience that I am basely bartering the\r\ngreatest benefits with which human beings can be indulged, for the\r\nmiserable gratifications which are hardly worthy of contributing to the\r\nenjoyments of the brute creation.\r\n\r\n\"And as I have grounded myself upon the principle, that my character is,\r\nunder the smiles of heaven, to be the work of my own hands, it becomes\r\nnecessary for me to determine upon what part of active or of speculative\r\nlife I mean to rest my pretensions to eminence. My own situation and that\r\nof my country equally prohibit me from seeking to derive any present\r\nexpectations from a public career. My disposition is not military; and,\r\nhappily, the warlike talents are not those which open the most pleasing or\r\nthe most reputable avenue to fame. I have had some transient thoughts of\r\nundertaking some useful literary performance, but the pursuit would\r\nmilitate too much at present with that of the profession upon which I am\r\nto depend, not only for my reputation, but for my subsistence.\r\n\r\n\"I have, therefore, concluded that the most proper object of my present\r\nattention is that profession itself. And in acquiring the faculty to\r\ndischarge the duties of it, in a manner suitable to my own wishes and the\r\nexpectations of my friends, I find ample room for close and attentive\r\napplication; for frequent and considerate observation; and for such\r\nbenefits of practical experience as occasional opportunities may throw in\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from John Adams, at this time Vice President of the\r\nUnited States, written to his wife at Quincy, will be interesting, as\r\nshowing, among other things, his anxiety that his sons should make some\r\nstart in life, which would give promise of future usefulness. He was far\r\nfrom believing that sons should repose in idleness on the reputation or\r\nwealth of parents.\r\n\r\n                                            \"Philadelphia, 2 March, 1793.\r\n\"My Dear,\r\n\"Your letter from your sick chamber, if not from your sick bed, has made\r\nme so uneasy, that I must get away as soon as possible. Monday morning, at\r\nsix, I am to set off in the stage; but how many days it will take to get\r\nhome, will depend on the roads or the winds. I don't believe Abby [his\r\ndaughter,] will go with me. Her husband [Col. William S. Smith,] is so\r\nproud of his wealth, that he would not let her go, I suppose, without a\r\ncoach-and-four; and such monarchical trumpery I will in future have\r\nnothing to do with. I will never travel but by stage, nor live at the seat\r\nof government but at lodgings, while they give me so despicable an\r\nallowance. Shiver my jib and start my planks if I do!\r\n\r\n\"I will stay but one night in New York. Smith says that my books are upon\r\nthe table of every member of the Committee for framing a constitution of\r\ngovernment for France, except Tom Paine, and he is so conceited as to\r\ndisdain to have anything to do with books. Although I abused Smith a\r\nlittle above, he is very clever and agreeable; but I have been obliged to\r\ncaution him against his disposition to boasting. Tell not of your\r\nprosperity, because it will make two men mad to one glad; nor of your\r\nadversity, for it will make two men glad to one sad. He boasts too much of\r\nhaving made his fortune, and placed himself at ease, above all favors of\r\ngovernment. This is a weakness, and betrays too little knowledge of the\r\nworld; too little penetration; too little discretion. I wish, however,\r\nthat my boys had a little more of his activity. I must soon treat them as\r\nthe pigeons treat their squabs--push them off the limb, and make them put\r\nout their wings or fall. Young pigeons will never fly till this is done.\r\nSmith has acquired the confidence of the French ministry, and the better\r\nsort of the members of the National Convention. But the Executive is too\r\nchangeable in that country to be depended on, without the utmost caution.\r\n                                    \"Adieu, adieu, tendrement,   J. A.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the sons of the noble patriot, soon \"put out his wings,\" and\r\nsoared, ultimately, to a pinnacle of honor and renown attained by few\r\namong men. In the winter of 1793 and 1794, the public mind had become\r\nhighly excited from the inflammatory appeals in behalf of France, by\r\nCitizen Genet, the French Minister to the United States. A large portion\r\nof the anti-Federal party took sides with Mr. Genet, against the neutral\r\nposition of our Government, and seemed determined to plunge the Union into\r\nthe European contest, in aid of the French Republic. Some idea may be\r\nobtained of the excitement which prevailed at this time, and of the\r\nperilous condition of the country, by an extract or two from letters of\r\nVice-President John Adams. In a letter dated Philadelphia, Dec. 5, 1793,\r\nhe writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It will require all the address, all the temper, and all the firmness of\r\nCongress and the States, to keep this people out of the war; or rather, to\r\navoid a declaration of war against us, from some mischievous power or\r\nother. It is but little that I can do, either by the functions which the\r\nConstitution has entrusted to me, or by my personal influence; but that\r\nlittle shall be industriously employed, until it is put beyond a doubt\r\nthat it will be fruitless; and then, I shall be as ready to meet\r\nunavoidable calamities, as any other citizen.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of Jan. 9, 1794, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"The prospects of this country are gloomy, but the situation of all Europe\r\nis calamitous beyond all former examples. At what time, and in what\r\nmanner, and by what means, the disasters which are come, and seem to be\r\ncoming on mankind, may be averted, I know not. Our own people have been\r\nimprudent, as I think, and are now smarting under the effects of their\r\nindiscretion; but this, instead of a consolation, is an aggravation of our\r\nmisfortune. Mr. Genet has been abusive on the President [Washington] and\r\nall his ministers, beyond all measure of decency or obligations of truth,\r\nand in other respects, not yet publicly investigated, his conduct has been\r\nsuch as to make it difficult to know what to do with him. * * * * * The\r\nnews of this evening is, that the Queen of France is no more.\r\n[Footnote: Marie Antoinette was beheaded in Paris, on the 16th of October,\r\n1773.]\r\nWhen will savages be satiated with blood? No prospect of peace in Europe,\r\nand therefore none of internal harmony in America. We cannot well be in a\r\nmore disagreeable situation than we are with all Europe, with all Indians,\r\nand with all Barbary rovers. Nearly one half of the Continent is in\r\nconstant opposition to the other, and the President's situation, which is\r\nhighly responsible, is very distressing.\"\r\n\r\nIt taxed the wisdom and skill of Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State,\r\nto counteract the influence of the French Minister, and prevent citizens\r\nof the United States from committing overt acts against the Allied\r\nSovereigns, and embroiling the Union in a foreign war. In this endeavor he\r\nwas greatly assisted by the pen of Mr. J. Q. Adams. This gentleman wrote a\r\nseries of essays for the public prints, under the signature of \"Columbus,\"\r\nreviewing the course of Mr. Genet. In these articles, he pointed out, with\r\ngreat clearness, the principles of the law of nations applicable to the\r\nsituation of the country in the neutral line of policy which had been\r\nwisely adopted.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this topic, John Adams writes his wife, as follows, under\r\ndate of Dec. 19, 1793:--\r\n\r\n\"The President has considered the conduct of Genet very nearly in the same\r\nlight with 'Columbus,' and has given him a bolt of thunder. We shall see\r\nhow this is supported by the two Houses. There are who gnash their teeth\r\nwith rage which they dare not own as yet. We shall soon see whether we\r\nhave any government or not in this country.\"\r\n\r\nThe political writings of the younger Adams had now brought him\r\nprominently before the public. They attracted the especial attention of\r\nMr. Jefferson, who saw in them a vastness of comprehension, a maturity of\r\njudgment and critical discrimination, which gave large promise of future\r\nusefulness and eminence. Before his retirement from the State Department,\r\nhe commended the youthful statesman to the favorable regard of President\r\nWashington, as one pre-eminently fitted for public service.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, although a soldier by profession, was a lover of\r\npeace. His policy during his administration of the government, was\r\npre-eminently pacific. Convinced that, in the infant state of the Union,\r\nwar with a foreign nation could result only in evil and ruin, he was\r\nanxious to cultivate the most friendly relations with foreign governments,\r\nand to carry out, both in letter and spirit, the strict neutrality he had\r\nproclaimed. To declare and maintain these principles abroad, and to form\r\npolitical and commercial relations with European powers, Washington looked\r\nanxiously around for one fitted for a mission so important. His attention\r\nsoon became fixed on John Quincy Adams. He saw in him qualities not only\r\nof deep political sagacity, and views of policy at unity with his own, but\r\na familiarity with the languages and customs of foreign courts, which\r\nmarked him as one every way calculated to represent our government with\r\ncredit in the old world. He accordingly, in May, 1794, appointed Mr. Adams\r\nMinister of the United States at the Hague.\r\n\r\nThat this prominent appointment was as flattering to Mr. Adams as it was\r\nunexpected, is naturally true. It was the more to his credit in\r\nconsideration of the fact, that in those days elevation to offices of this\r\nimportance was the award of merit and talent, and not the result of\r\nimportunity, or the payment of party services. Mr. Adams was at this time\r\nin the twenty-seventh year of his age--a younger man, undoubtedly, than\r\nhas since ever been selected by our Government to fulfil a trust so\r\nimportant. But the ability and discretion of the young diplomatist, and\r\nthe success which attended his negotiations in Europe, so creditable to\r\nhimself and his country, fully justified the wisdom of Washington in\r\nselecting him for this important duty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the father of Mr. Adams was then Vice President of the United\r\nStates, yet it is well known his appointment on a foreign mission was\r\nobtained without the influence or even the request of his parent. It is\r\nnot strictly correct, however, as stated by several biographers, that he\r\nwas selected for the mission to Holland without any previous intimation of\r\nthe President's intentions to his father. This is made evident by the\r\nfollowing extract of a letter from John Adams to his wife, dated\r\nPhiladelphia, 27th May, 1794, conveying intelligence which must have made\r\na mother's heart swell with honest pride and satisfaction:--\r\n\r\n\"It is proper that I should apprize you, that the President has it in\r\ncontemplation to send your son to Holland, that you may recollect yourself\r\nand prepare for the event. I make this communication to you in confidence,\r\nat the desire of the President, communicated to me yesterday by the\r\nSecretary of State. You must keep it an entire secret until it shall be\r\nannounced to the public in the journal of the Senate. But our son must\r\nhold himself in readiness to come to Philadelphia, to converse with the\r\nPresident, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, &c., and receive\r\nhis commissions and instructions, without loss of time. He will go to\r\nProvidence in the stage, and thence to New York by water, and thence to\r\nPhiladelphia in the stage. He will not set out, however, until he is\r\ninformed of his appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your son!\" is the phrase by which the father meant to convey his own\r\nsense of how large a part the mother had in training that son; and to\r\nenhance the compliment, it is communicated to her at the desire of\r\nPresident Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS TRANSFERRED TO BERLIN--HIS MARRIAGE--LITERARY\r\nPURSUITS--TRAVELS IN SILESIA--NEGOTIATES TREATIES WITH SWEDEN\r\nAND PRUSSIA--RECALLED TO THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams presented himself at the Hague, as Minister Plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States, in the summer or fall of 1794. Ten years before, he was\r\nthere with his father--a lad, attending school--at which time the father\r\nwrote: \"They give him a good character wherever he has been, and I hope he\r\nwill make a good man.\" How abundantly that hope was likely to be\r\nfulfilled, the elevated and responsible position occupied by the son at\r\nthe expiration of the first ten years after it was expressed, gave a\r\npromising and true indication.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Holland, Mr. Adams found the affairs of that country in\r\ngreat confusion, in consequence of the French invasion. So difficult was\r\nit to prosecute any permanent measures for the benefit of the United\r\nStates, owing to the existing wars and the unsettled state of things in\r\nEurope, that after a few months he thought seriously of returning home. A\r\nreport of this nature having reached President Washington, drew from him a\r\nletter to Vice President John Adams, dated Aug. 20, 1795, in which the\r\nfollowing language occurs:--\r\n\r\n\"Your son must not think of retiring from the path he is now in. His\r\nprospects, if he pursues it, are fair; and I shall be much mistaken if, in\r\nas short a time as can well be expected, he is not found at the head of\r\nthe Diplomatic Corps, be the government administered by whomsoever the\r\npeople may choose.\"\r\n\r\nThis approbation of his proceedings thus far, and encouragement as to\r\nfuture success, from so high a source, undoubtedly induced the younger\r\nAdams to forego his inclination to withdraw from the field of diplomacy.\r\nHe continued in Holland until near the close of Washington's\r\nadministration. That he was not an inattentive observer of the momentous\r\nevents then transpiring in Europe, but was watchful and faithful in all\r\nthat pertained to the welfare of his country, is abundantly proved by his\r\nofficial correspondence with the government at home. His communications\r\nwere esteemed by Washington, as of the highest value, affording him, as\r\nthey did, a luminous description of the movement of continental affairs,\r\nupon which he could place the most implicit reliance.\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter from John Adams, will show the interest\r\nhe naturally took in the welfare of his son while abroad, and also afford\r\na brief glance at the political movements of that day. It is dated\r\nPhiladelphia, Jan. 23, 1796:--\r\n\r\n\"We have been very unfortunate in the delays which have attended the\r\ndispatches of our ambassadors. Very lucky, Mr. John Quincy Adams, that you\r\nare not liable to criticism on this occasion! This demurrage would have\r\nbeen charged doubly, both to your account and that of your father. It\r\nwould have been a scheme, a trick, a design, a contrivance, from hatred to\r\nFrance, attachment to England, monarchical manoeuvres, and aristocratical\r\ncunning! Oh! how eloquent they would have been!\r\n\r\n\"The southern gentry are playing, at present, a very artful game, which I\r\nmay develope to you in confidence hereafter, under the seal of secrecy.\r\nBoth in conversation and in letters, they are representing the\r\nVice-President [John Adams,] as a man of moderation. Although rather\r\ninclined to limited monarchy, and somewhat attached to the English, he is\r\nmuch less so than Jay or Hamilton. For their part, for the sake of\r\nconciliation, they should be very willing he should be continued as\r\nVice-President, provided the northern gentlemen would consent that\r\nJefferson should be President. I most humbly thank you for your kind\r\ncondescension, Messieurs Transchesapeakes.\r\n                 \"Witness my hand,\r\n                                                        \"JOHN ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nAnother allusion to his son while abroad, is made by the elder Adams, in a\r\nletter dated Philadelphia, March 25,1796.\r\n\r\n\"The President told me he had that day received three or four letters from\r\nhis new Minister in London, one of them as late as the 29th of December.\r\nMr. Pickering informs me that Mr. Adams [Footnote: John Quincy Adams]\r\nmodestly declined a presentation at court, but it was insisted on by Lord\r\nGrenville; and, accordingly, he was presented to the King, and I think\r\nthe Queen, and made his harangues and received his answers. By the papers\r\nI find that Mr. Pinckney appeared at court on the 28th of January, after\r\nwhich, I presume, Mr. Adams had nothing to do but return to Holland.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his residence as Minister at the Hague, Mr. Adams had occasion to\r\nvisit London, to exchange the ratifications of the treaty recently formed\r\nwith Great Britain, and to take measures for carrying its provisions into\r\neffect. (Alluded to in the above letter from John Adams.) It was at this\r\ntime that he formed an acquaintance with Miss Louisa Catharine Johnson,\r\ndaughter of Joshua Johnson, Esq., of Maryland, Consular Agent of the\r\nUnited States at London, and niece of Governor Johnson of Maryland, a\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court of the United States, and a signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. The friendship they formed for each other,\r\nsoon ripened into a mutual attachment and an engagement. They were married\r\non the 26th of July, 1797. It was a happy union. For more than half a\r\ncentury they shared each other's joys and sorrows. The venerable matron\r\nwho for this long period accompanied him in all the vicissitudes of his\r\neventful life, still survives, to deplore the loss of him who had ever\r\nproved a faithful protector and the kindest of husbands.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the elder Adams had been elected President of the United\r\nStates, in 1796. The curious reader may have a desire to know something of\r\nthe views, feelings and anticipations of those elevated to places of the\r\nhighest distinction, and of the amount of enjoyment they reap from the\r\nhonors conferred upon them. A glance behind the scenes is furnished in the\r\nfollowing correspondence between John Adams and his wife, which took place\r\nat his election to the Presidency.

ADAMS TO HIS WIFE.\r\n                                       \"Philadelphia, 4th of Feb., 1797.\r\n\"My Dearest Friend,\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not communicate to anybody the hints I give you about our\r\nprospects; but they appear every day worse and worse. House rent at\r\ntwenty-seven hundred dollars a year, fifteen hundred dollars for a\r\ncarriage, one thousand for one pair of horses, all the glasses, ornaments,\r\nkitchen furniture, the best chairs, settees, plateaus, &c., all to\r\npurchase; all the china, delph or wedgewood, glass and crockery of every\r\nsort to purchase, and not a farthing probably will the House of\r\nRepresentatives allow, though the Senate have voted a small addition. All\r\nthe linen besides. I shall not pretend to keep more than one pair of\r\nhorses for a carriage, and one for a saddle. Secretaries, servants, wood,\r\ncharities, which are demanded as rights, and the million dittoes, present\r\nsuch a prospect as is enough to disgust anyone. Yet not one word must we\r\nsay. We cannot go back. We must stand our ground as long as we can.\r\nDispose of our places with the help of our friend Dr. Tufts, as well as\r\nyou can. We are impatient for news, but that is always so at this season.\r\n                                             I am tenderly your   J.

If they do not, I will have no\r\nhouse before next fall, and then a very moderate one, with very moderate\r\nfurniture. The prisoners from Algiers [Footnote: American citizens who had\r\nlong been in captivity among the Algerines.] arrived yesterday in this\r\nCity, in good health, and looking very well.

ADAMS TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                      \"Philadelphia, 5th March, 1797.\r\n\"My Dearest Friend,\r\n\r\n\"Your dearest friend never had a more trying day than yesterday.[Footnote:\r\nThe day of his inauguration as President.]  A solemn scene it was indeed;\r\nand it was made more affecting to me by the presence of the General,\r\n[Washington,] whose countenance was as serene and unclouded as the day. He\r\nseemed to me to enjoy a triumph over me. Methought I heard him say, 'Ay!\r\nI am fairly out, and you fairly in! See which of us will be happiest.'\r\nWhen the ceremony was over, he came and made me a visit, and cordially\r\ncongratulated me, and wished my administration might be happy, successful,\r\nand honorable.\r\n\r\n\"It is now settled that I am to go into his house. It is whispered that he\r\nintends to take French leave to-morrow. I shall write you as fast as we\r\nproceed. My chariot is finished, and I made my first appearance in it\r\nyesterday. It is simple, but elegant enough. My horses are young, but\r\nclever.\r\n\r\n\"In the chamber of the House of Representatives, was a multitude as great\r\nas the space could contain, and I believe scarcely a dry eye but\r\nWashington's. The sight of the sun setting full orbed, and another rising,\r\nthough less splendid, was a novelty. Chief Justice Ellsworth administered\r\nthe oath, and with great energy. Judges Cushing, Wilson, and Iredell,\r\nwere present. Many ladies. I had not slept well the night before, and did\r\nnot sleep well the night after. I was unwell, and did not know whether I\r\nshould get through or not. I did, however. How the business was received,\r\nI know not; only I have been told that Mason, the treaty publisher, said\r\nwe should lose nothing by the change, for he never heard such a speech in\r\npublic in his life.\r\n\r\n\"All agree that, taken altogether, it was the sublimest thing ever\r\nexhibited in America.\r\n\r\n\"I am, my dearest friend, most affectionately and kindly yours,\r\n                                                  \"JOHN ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nOn entering upon the duties of the Presidency, John Adams was greatly\r\nembarrassed in regard to the line he should adopt toward his son. True,\r\nthe younger Adams had been entrusted by Washington with an important\r\nembassy abroad, and had acquitted himself with great credit in his\r\nresponsible station; but the father, with a delicacy highly honorable,\r\nhesitated continuing him in office, lest he might be charged with unworthy\r\nfavoritism, and a disposition to promote the interest of his family at the\r\nexpense of public good. In this exigency, not daring to trust his own\r\njudgment, lest its decisions might be warped by parental solicitude, he\r\nresorted to the wisdom and experience of Washington. Writing him for\r\nadvice on this subject, he received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n                                              \"Monday, Feb. 20, 1797.\r\n\"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for giving me a perusal of the enclosed. The sentiments do\r\nhonor to the head and the heart of the writer; and if my wishes would be\r\nof any avail, they should go to you in a strong hope, that you will not\r\nwithhold merited promotion from John Q. Adams, because he is your son. For\r\nwithout intending to compliment the father or the mother, or to censure\r\nany others, I give it as my decided opinion, that Mr. Adams is the most\r\nvaluable public character we have abroad; and that there remains no doubt\r\nin my mind, that he will prove himself to be the ablest of all our\r\ndiplomatic corps. If he was now to be brought into that line, or into any\r\nother public walk, I could not, upon the principle which has regulated my\r\nown conduct, disapprove of the caution which is hinted at in the letter.\r\nBut he is already entered; the public, more and more, as he is known, are\r\nappreciating his talents and worth; and his country would sustain a loss,\r\nif these were to be checked by over delicacy on your part.\r\n\r\n\"With sincere esteem, and affectionate regard,\r\n                             \"I am ever yours,\r\n                                 \"GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter is characteristic of the discernment and nobleness of\r\nWashington. Appreciating at a glance the perplexed position of Mr. Adams,\r\nand wisely discriminating between the bringing forward of his son for the\r\nfirst time into public service, and the continuing him where he had\r\nalready been placed by others, and shown himself worthy of all trust and\r\nconfidence, he frankly advised him to overcome his scruples, and permit\r\nhis son to remain in a career so full of promise to himself and his\r\ncountry. President Adams, in agreement with this counsel, determined to\r\nallow his son to continue in Europe in the public capacity to which he had\r\nbeen promoted by Washington.\r\n\r\nShortly previous to the close of Washington's administration, he\r\ntransferred the younger Adams from the Hague, by an appointment as\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary to Portugal, but before proceeding to Lisbon, his\r\nfather, in the meantime having become President, changed his destination\r\nto Berlin. He arrived in that city in the autumn of 1797, and immediately\r\nentered upon the discharge of his duties as Minister of the United States.\r\nIn 1798, while retaining his office at Berlin, he was commissioned to form\r\na commercial treaty with Sweden.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Berlin, Mr. Adams, while attending with unsleeping\r\ndiligence to his public duties, did not forego the more congenial pursuits\r\nof literature. He cultivated the acquaintance of many eminent German\r\nscholars and poets, and manifested a friendly sympathy in their pursuits.\r\nIn a letter to the late Dr. Follen writes of that day as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"At this time, Wieland was there the most popular of the German poets.\r\nAnd although there was in his genius neither the originality nor the deep\r\npathos of Goethe, Klopstock, or Schiller there was something in the\r\nplayfulness of his imagination, in the tenderness of his sensibility, in\r\nthe sunny cheerfulness of his philosophy, and in the harmony of his\r\nversification, which delighted me.\"\r\n\r\nTo perfect his knowledge of the German language, Mr. Adams made a metrical\r\ntranslation of Wieland's Oberon into the English language. The\r\npublication of this work, which at one time was designed, was superseded\r\nby the appearance of a similar translation by Sotheby.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1800, Mr. Adams made a tour through Silesia. He was\r\ncharmed with the inhabitants of that region, their condition and habits.\r\nIn many respects he found them bearing a great similarity to the people of\r\nhis own native New England. He communicated his impressions during this\r\nexcursion, in a series of letters to a younger brother in Philadelphia.\r\nThese letters were interesting, and were considered of great value at that\r\ntime, in consequence of many important facts they contained in regard to\r\nthe manufacturing establishments of Silesia. They were published, without\r\nMr. Adams's knowledge, in the Port Folio, a weekly paper edited by Joseph\r\nDennie, at Philadelphia. The series was afterwards collected and\r\npublished in a volume, in London, and has been translated into German and\r\nFrench, and extensively circulated on the continent.\r\n\r\nAmong other labors while at Berlin, Mr. Adams succeeded in forming a\r\ntreaty of amity and commerce with the Prussian government. The protracted\r\ncorrespondence with the Prussian commissioners, which resulted in this\r\ntreaty, involving as it did the rights of neutral commerce, was conducted\r\nwith consummate ability on the part of Mr. Adams, and received the fullest\r\nsanction of the government at home.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams' missions at the Hague and at Berlin, constituted his first step\r\nin the intricate paths of diplomacy. They were accomplished amid the\r\nmomentous events which convulsed all Europe, at the close of the\r\neighteenth century. Republican France, exasperated at the machinations of\r\nthe Allied Sovereigns to destroy its liberties, so recently obtained, was\r\npushing its armies abroad, determined, in self-defence, to kindle the\r\nflames of revolution in every kingdom on the Continent. Great Britain,\r\ncombined with Austria and other European powers, was using every effort to\r\ncrush the French democracy, and remove from before the eyes of\r\ndown-trodden millions an example so dangerous to monarchical institutions.\r\nThe star of Napoleon had commenced its ascent, with a suddenness and\r\nbrightness which startled the imbecile occupants of old thrones. His\r\nlegions had rushed down from the Alps upon the sunny plains of Italy, and\r\nwith the swoop of an eagle, had demolished towns, cities, kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAmid this conflict of nations, the commerce and navigation of the United\r\nStates, a neutral power, were made common object of prey to all. Great\r\nBritain and France especially, did not hesitate to make depredations, at\r\nonce the most injurious and irritating. Our ships were captured, our\r\nrights disregarded. In the midst of these scenes, surrounded by\r\ndifficulties and embarrassments on every hand, the youthful ambassador was\r\ncompelled to come into collision with the veteran and wily politicians of\r\nthe old world. How well he maintained the dignity and honor of his\r\ngovernment--how sleepless the vigilance with which he watched the\r\nmovements on the vast field of political strife--how prompt to protest\r\nagainst all encroachments--how skilful in conducting negotiations--and how\r\nactive to promote the interests of the Union, wherever his influence could\r\nbe felt--the  archives of our country will abundantly testify. It was a\r\nfitting and promising commencement of a long public career which has been\r\nfull of usefulness and of honor.\r\n\r\nThe administration of John Adams, as President of the United States, was\r\ncharacterized by great prudence and moderation, considering the excited\r\nstate of the times. There cannot be a doubt he was anxious to copy the\r\nworthy example of his illustrious predecessor, in administering the\r\ngovernment on principles of strict impartiality, for the good of the whole\r\npeople, without respect to conflicting parties. Immediately on his\r\ninauguration, he had an interview with Mr. Jefferson, then Vice-\r\nPresident, and proposed the adoption of steps that would have a tendency\r\nto quell the spirit of faction which pervaded the country. That Mr.\r\nJefferson, on his part, cherished a profound respect for Mr. Adams, his\r\nold co-laborer in the cause of American freedom, is evident from his\r\nletters and speeches of that day. In his speech on taking the chair of the\r\nSenate, as Vice-President, he expressed himself in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"I might here proceed, and with the greatest truth, to declare my zealous\r\nattachment to the Constitution of the United States; that I consider the\r\nunion of these States as the first of blessings; and as the first of\r\nduties the preservation of that Constitution which secures it; but I\r\nsuppose these declarations not pertinent to the occasion of entering into\r\nan office, whose primary business is merely to preside over the forms of\r\nthis House; and no one more sincerely prays that no accident may call me\r\nto the higher and more important functions, which the Constitution\r\neventually devolves on this office. These have been justly confided to the\r\neminent character which has preceded me here, whose talents and integrity\r\nhave been known and revered by me, through a long course of years; have\r\nbeen the foundation of a cordial and uninterrupted friendship between us;\r\nand I devoutly pray he may be long preserved for the government, the\r\nhappiness and the prosperity of our common country.\"\r\n\r\nThe sincere attempts of President Adams to produce harmony of political\r\naction among the American people, were unavailing. The extraordinary\r\nevents transpiring in Europe, exerted an influence on domestic politics,\r\nwhich could not be neutralized. \"The enemies of France\"--\"the friends of\r\nEngland,\" or vice versa, were cries which convulsed the nation to its\r\ncentre. The entire population was sundered into contending parties.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was a true republican. His political opponents charged him with\r\nmonarchical tendencies and aspirations, but charged him most falsely. His\r\nlife, devoted unreservedly to the service of his country through all its\r\ndark and perilous journey to the achievement of its independence--his\r\npublic speeches and documents--his private letters, written to his bosom\r\ncompanion, with no expectation that the eye of any other would ever rest\r\nupon them--all testify his ardent devotion to the principles of\r\nrepublicanism. At the breaking out of the French Revolution, he yielded it\r\nhis hearty support, and did not withdraw his countenance, until compelled,\r\nby the scenes of anarchy and of carnage which soon ensued, to turn away\r\nwith horror and raise his voice against proceedings of savage ferocity.\r\nBut while condemning the excesses of the French revolutionists, he was no\r\nfriend of Great Britain. This is made evident by a multitude of facts.\r\nRead, for instance, the following extract from a letter, not written for\r\npublic effect, addressed to his wife, dated Philadelphia, April 9, 1796:--\r\n\r\n\"I have read 'the minister's' dispatches from London. The King could not\r\nhelp discovering his old ill humor. The mad idiot will never recover.\r\nBlunderer by nature, accidents are all against him. Every measure of his\r\nreign has been wrong. It seems they don't like Pinckney. They think he is\r\nno friend to that country, and too much of a French Jacobin. They wanted\r\nto work up some idea or other of introducing another in his place, but our\r\nyoung politician [Footnote: J. Q. Adams.] saw into them too deeply to be\r\nduped. At his last visit to Court, the King passed him without speaking to\r\nhim, which, you know, will be remarked by courtiers of all nations. I am\r\nglad of it; for I would not have my son go so far as Mr. Jay, and affirm\r\nthe friendly disposition of that country to this. I know better. I know\r\ntheir jealousy, envy, hatred, and revenge, covered under pretended\r\ncontempt.\"\r\n\r\nWhile President Adams cherished no partialities for Great Britain, and had\r\nno desire to promote her especial interest, he was compelled by the force\r\nof circumstances, during his administration to assume a hostile attitude\r\ntowards France. The French Directory, chagrined at the failure of all\r\nattempts to induce the government of the United States to abandon its\r\nneutrality and take up arms in their behalf against the Allied Sovereigns,\r\nand deeply incensed at the treaty recently concluded between England and\r\nthe United States, resorted to retaliatory measures. They adopted\r\ncommercial regulations designed to cripple and destroy our foreign trade.\r\nThey passed an ordinance authorizing, in certain cases, the seizure and\r\nconfiscation of American vessels and cargoes. They refused to receive Mr.\r\nPinckney, the American minister, and ordered him peremptorily to leave\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams convened Congress, by proclamation, on the 15th of June, 1797,\r\nand in his message laid before that body a lucid statement of the\r\naggressions of the French Directory. Congress made advances, with a view\r\nto a reconciliation with France. But failing in this attempt, immediate\r\nand vigorous measures were adopted to place the country in a condition for\r\nwar. A small standing army was authorized. The command was tendered to\r\nGen. Washington, who accepted of it with alacrity, sanctioning as he did\r\nthese defensive measures of the government. Steps were taken for a naval\r\narmament, and the capture of French vessels   authorized. These energetic\r\ndemonstrations produced their desired effect. The war proceeded no farther\r\nthan a few collisions at sea. The French Directory became alarmed, and\r\nmade overtures of peace.\r\n\r\nWashington did not survive to witness the restoration of amicable\r\nrelations with France. On the 14th of December, 1799, after a brief\r\nillness, he departed this life, at Mount Vernon, aged sixty-eight years.\r\nOn receiving this mournful intelligence, Congress, then in session at\r\nPhiladelphia, passed the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Speaker's chair should be shrouded in black; that the\r\nmembers should wear black during the session, and that a joint committee,\r\nfrom the Senate and the House, be appointed to devise the most suitable\r\nmanner of paying honor to the memory of the Man, first in war, first in\r\npeace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nTestimonials of sorrow were exhibited, and funeral orations and eulogies\r\nwere delivered, throughout the United States. The Father of his Country\r\nslept in death, and an entire people mourned his departure!\r\n\r\nOn assuming the duties of the Presidency, the elder Adams found the\r\nfinances of the country in a condition of the most deplorable prostration.\r\nTo sustain the government in this department, it was deemed indispensable\r\nto establish a system of direct taxation, by internal duties. This\r\nproduced great dissatisfaction throughout the Union. An \"alien law\" was\r\npassed, which empowered the President to banish from the United States,\r\nany foreigner whom he should consider dangerous to the peace and safety of\r\nthe country. And a \"sedition law,\" imposing fine and imprisonment for \"any\r\nfalse, scandalous, and malicious writing against the government of the\r\nUnited States, or either house of Congress, or the President.\"\r\n\r\nThese measures are not justly chargeable to John Adams. They were not\r\nrecommended nor desired by him; but were brought forward and urged by Gen.\r\nHamilton and his friends. Nevertheless upon Mr. Adams was heaped the odium\r\nthey excited. The leading measures of his administration--the\r\ndemonstration against France; the standing army; the direct taxation; the\r\nalien and sedition laws--all tended to injure his popularity with the mass\r\nof the people, and to destroy his prospects of a re-election to the\r\npresidency. The perplexities he was compelled to encounter during his\r\nadministration, may be conceived on perusal of his language in a letter\r\ndated March 17, 1797:--\r\n\r\n\"From the situation where I now am, I see a scene of ambition beyond all\r\nmy former suspicions or imaginations; an emulation which will turn our\r\ngovernment topsy-turvy. Jealousies and rivalries have been my theme, and\r\nchecks and balances as their antidotes, till I am ashamed to repeat the\r\nwords; but they never stared me in the face in such horrid forms as at\r\npresent. I see how the thing is going. At the next election England will\r\nset up Jay or Hamilton, and France Jefferson, and all the corruption of\r\nPoland will be introduced; unless the American spirit should rise and say,\r\nwe will have neither John Bull nor Louis Baboon.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1800, the seat of government was removed to Washington. In taking\r\npossession of the President's house, Mr. Adams bestowed a benediction on\r\nit, which must ever meet with a response from all American hearts--\"\r\nBefore I end my letter, I pray heaven to bestow the best of blessings on\r\nthis house, and on all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but\r\nhonest and wise men ever rule under this roof!\" A description of the house\r\nand the city, at that time, is furnished in a letter from Mrs. Adams to\r\nher daughter, written in November, 1800:--\r\n\r\n\"I arrived here on Sunday last, and without meeting any accident worth\r\nnoticing, except losing ourselves when we left Baltimore, and going eight\r\nor nine miles on the Frederick road, by which means we were obliged to go\r\nthe other eight through the woods, where we wandered two hours without\r\nfinding a guide or the path. Fortunately, a straggling black came up with\r\nus, and we engaged him as a guide to extricate us out of our difficulty;\r\nbut woods are all you see, from Baltimore, until you reach the city, which\r\nis only so in name. Here and there is a small cot, without a glass window,\r\ninterspersed among the forests, through which you travel miles without\r\nseeing any human being. * * * * * * * * * The house is made habitable, but\r\nthere is not a single apartment finished, and all withinside, except the\r\nplastering, has been done since Briesier came. We have not the least\r\nfence, yard, or other convenience without, and the great unfinished\r\naudience-room I make a drying-room of, to hang up the clothes in. The\r\nprincipal stairs are not up, and will not be this winter. Six chambers are\r\nmade comfortable; two are occupied by the President and Mr. Shaw; two\r\nlower rooms, one for a common parlor, and one for a levee room. Up stairs\r\nthere is the oval room, which is designed for the drawing-room, and has\r\nthe crimson furniture in it. It is a very handsome room now; but when\r\ncompleted, it will be beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nThe presidential contest in 1800, was urged with a warmth and bitterness,\r\nby both parties, which has not been equalled in any election since that\r\nperiod. It was the first time two candidates ever presented themselves to\r\nthe people as rival aspirants for the highest honor in their gift. Both\r\nwere good men and true--both were worthy of the confidence of the country.\r\nBut Mr. Adams, weighed down by the unpopularity of acts adopted during his\r\nadministration, and suffering under the charge of being an enemy to\r\nrevolutionary France, and a friend of monarchical England, was distanced\r\nand defeated by his competitor. Mr. Jefferson was elected the third\r\nPresident of the Republic, and was inaugurated on the 4th of March, 1801.\r\nOne of the last acts of John Adams, before retiring from the Presidency,\r\nwas to recall his son from Berlin, that Mr. Jefferson might have no\r\nembarrassment in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES--ELECTED TO THE MASSACHUSETTS\r\nSENATE--APPOINTED U. S. SENATOR--SUPPORTS MR. JEFFERSON--PROFESSOR OF\r\nRHETORIC AND BELLES LETTRES--APPOINTED MINISTER TO RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams returned to the United States from his first foreign\r\nembassy, in 1801. During the stormy period of his father's administration,\r\nand the ensuing presidential canvass, he was fortunately absent from the\r\ncountry. Had he been at home, his situation would have been one of great\r\ndelicacy. It can hardly be supposed he would have opposed his father's\r\nmeasures, or his reelection. Yet to have thrown his influence in their\r\nbehalf, would have subjected him to the imputation of being moved by\r\nfilial attachment rather than the convictions of duty. From this painful\r\ndilemma, he was saved by his foreign residence. He came home uncommitted\r\nto party measures, untrammelled by party tactics or predilections; and\r\nthus stood before the people, as he could wish to stand, perfectly\r\nunshackled, and ready to act as duty and conscience should direct.\r\n\r\nArriving in the United States with distinguished honors gained by\r\nsuccessful foreign diplomacy, Mr. Adams was not allowed to remain long in\r\ninactivity. In 1802 be was elected to the Senate of Massachusetts, from\r\nthe Boston district. During his services in that body, he gave an\r\nindication of that independence, as a politician, which characterized him\r\nthrough life, by his opposition to a powerful combination of banking\r\ninterests, which was effected among his immediate constituents. Although\r\nhis opposition was unavailing, yet it clearly showed that the integrity of\r\nthe man was superior to the policy of the mere politician. But higher\r\nhonors awaited him.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, he was elected to the Senate of the United States, by the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts. Thus at the early age of thirty-six years,\r\nhe had attained to the highest legislative body of the Union. Young in\r\nyears, but mature in talent and experience, he took his seat amid the\r\nconscript fathers of the country, to act a part which soon drew upon him\r\nthe eyes of the nation, both in admiration and in censure.\r\n\r\nThe period of Mr. Adams' service in the United States Senate, was one in\r\nwhich the position and the interests of the country were surrounded by\r\nembarrassments and perils of the most threatening character. The party\r\nwhich had supported his father had become divided and defeated. Mr.\r\nJefferson, elevated to the Presidency after a heated and angry contest,\r\nwas an object of the dislike and suspicion of the Federalists, The\r\nconflicts of the belligerent nations in Europe, and the measures of\r\nforeign policy they severally adopted, not only affected the interests of\r\nthe United States, but were added elements to inflame the party contests\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, Bonaparte stepped from the Consul chamber to the throne of the\r\nFrench Empire. All Europe was bending to his giant rule. Great Britain\r\nalone, with characteristic and inherent stubbornness, had set itself as a\r\nrock against his ambitious aspirations, and prosecuted with unabated vigor\r\nits determined hostility to all his measures of trade and of conquest. In\r\nNovember, 1807, the British Government issued the celebrated \"Orders in\r\nCouncil,\" forbidding all trade with France and her allies. This measure\r\nwas met by Napoleon, in December, with his \"Milan Decree,\" prohibiting\r\nevery description of commerce with England or her colonies. Between these\r\nchecks and counterchecks of European nations, the commerce of the United\r\nStates was in peril of being swept entirely from the ocean.\r\n\r\nDuring most of this perplexed and trying period, Mr. J. Q. Adams retained\r\nhis seat in the United States Senate. Although sent there by the suffrages\r\nof the Federal party, in the Massachusetts Legislature, yet he did not,\r\nand would not, act simply as a partisan. This in fact was a prominent\r\ncharacteristic in Mr. Adams throughout his entire life, and is the key\r\nwhich explains many of his acts otherwise inexplicable. His noble and\r\npatriotic spirit arose above the shackles of party. He loved the interests\r\nof his country, the happiness of Man, more than the success of a mere\r\nparty. So far as the party with which he acted advocated measures which he\r\nconceived to be wise and healthful, he yielded his hearty and vigorous\r\nco-operation. But whenever it swerved from this line of integrity, his\r\ninfluence was thrown into the opposite scale. This was the rule of his\r\nlong career. No persuasions or emoluments, no threats, no intimidations,\r\ncould turn him from it, to the breadth of a hair. It was in consequence of\r\nthis characteristic, that it has so frequently been said of Mr. Adams,\r\nthat he was not a reliable party man. This was to a degree true. He was\r\nnot reliable for any policy adopted simply to promote party interests, and\r\nsecure party ends. But in regard to all measures which in his judgment\r\nwould advance the welfare of the people, secure the rights of man, and\r\nelevate the race, no politician, no statesman the world has produced,\r\ncould be more perfectly relied upon.\r\n\r\nThis disposition to act right, whether with or against his party, was\r\ndeveloped by the first vote he ever gave in a legislative body. While in\r\nthe Massachusetts Senate, the Federalists were the dominant party. It was\r\nthe custom in that State, to choose the whole of the Governor's Council\r\nfrom the party which had the majority in the Legislature. In May, 1802,\r\nMr. Adams was desirous that a rule should be adopted more regardful of the\r\nrights of the minority. He accordingly proposed that several\r\nanti-Federalists should have seats in the Council of Gov. Strong, and gave\r\nhis first vote to that measure.\r\n\r\nOn a certain occasion, Mr. Adams was asked, \"What are the recognized\r\nprinciples of politics?\" He replied, that there were no principles in\r\npolitics--there were recognized precepts, but they were bad ones. But,\r\ncontinued the inquirer, is not this a good one--\"To seek the greatest\r\ngood of the greatest number?\" No, said he, that is the worst of all, for\r\nit looks specious, while it is ruinous. What shall become of the minority,\r\nin that case?  This is the only principle to seek--\"the greatest good of\r\nall.\" [Footnote: Massachusetts Quarterly, June, 1849.]\r\n\r\nA few months after Mr. Adams' entrance into the Senate of the United\r\nStates, a law was passed by Congress, at the suggestion of Mr. Jefferson,\r\nauthorizing the purchase of Louisiana. Mr. Adams deemed this measure an\r\nencroachment on the Constitution of the United States, and opposed it on\r\nthe ground of its unconstitutionality. He was one of six senators who\r\nvoted against it. Yet when the measure had been legally consummated, he\r\nyielded it his support. In passing laws for the government of the\r\nterritory thus obtained, the right of trial by jury was granted only in\r\ncapital cases. Mr. Adams labored to have it extended to all criminal\r\noffences. Before the territory had a representative in Congress, the\r\ngovernment proposed to levy a tax on the people for purposes of revenue.\r\nThis attempt met the decided opposition of Mr. Adams. He insisted it would\r\nbe an exercise of government, without the consent of the governed, which,\r\nto all intents, is a despotism.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, he labored to have Congress pass a law levying a duty on the\r\nimportation of slaves. This was the first public indication of his views\r\non the subject of slavery. It was a premonition of the bold, unflinching,\r\nnoble warfare against that institution, and of the advocacy of human\r\nfreedom and human rights in the widest sense, which characterized the\r\nclosing scenes of his remarkable career, and which will perpetuate his\r\nfame, when other acts of his life shall have passed from the remembrance\r\nof men. Although at that early day but little was said in regard to\r\nslavery, yet the young senator saw it was fraught with danger to the\r\nUnion--conferring political power and influence on slaveholders, on\r\nprinciples false and pernicious, and calculated ultimately to distract the\r\nharmony of the country, and endanger the permanency of our free\r\ninstitutions. He labored, therefore, to check the increase of slave power,\r\nby the only means which, probably, appeared feasible at that time.\r\n\r\nBut a crisis in his senatorial career at length arrived. The commerce of\r\nthe United States had suffered greatly by \"Orders in Council,\" and \"Milan\r\nDecrees.\" Our ships were seized, conducted into foreign ports and\r\nconfiscated, with their cargoes. American seamen were impressed by British\r\ncruisers, and compelled to serve in a foreign navy. The American frigate\r\nPhiladelphia, while near the coast of the United States, on refusing to\r\ngive up four men claimed to be British subjects, was fired into by the\r\nEnglish man-of-war Leopard, and several of her crew killed and wounded.\r\nThese events caused the greatest excitement in the United States.\r\nPetitions, memorials, remonstrances, were poured in upon Congress from\r\nevery part of the Union. Mr. Jefferson endeavored by embassies,\r\nnegotiations, and the exertion of every influence in his power, to arrest\r\nthese destructive proceedings, and obtain a redress of grievances. But all\r\nwas in vain. At length he determined on an embargo, as the only means of\r\nsecuring our commerce from the grasp of the unscrupulous mistress of the\r\nseas. An act to that effect was passed in Dec., 1807. This effectually\r\nprostrated what little foreign commerce had been left to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn these proceedings Mr. Jefferson was stoutly opposed by the Federal\r\nparty. Massachusetts, then the chief commercial State in the Union,\r\nresisted with its utmost influence the Embargo Act, as pre-eminently\r\ndestructive to its welfare, and looked to its Senators and Representatives\r\nin Congress to urge an opposition to the extreme. What course should Mr.\r\nAdams adopt? On the one hand, personal friendship, the party which elected\r\nhim to the Senate, the immediate interests of his constituents, called\r\nupon him to oppose the measures of the administration. On the other hand,\r\nmore enlarged considerations presented themselves. The interest, the\r\nhonor, the ultimate prosperity of the whole country--its reputation and\r\ninfluence in the eyes of the world--demanded that the Government should be\r\nsupported in its efforts to check the aggressions of foreign nations, and\r\nestablish the rights of American citizens. In such an alternative John\r\nQuincy Adams could not hesitate. Turning from all other considerations but\r\na desire to promote the dignity and welfare of the Union, he threw\r\nhimself, without reserve, into the ranks of the administration party, and\r\nlabored zealously to second the measures of Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThis act subjected Mr. Adams to the severest censure. He was charged with\r\nbasely forsaking his party--with the most corrupt venality--with the low\r\nmotive of seeking to promote ambitious longings and selfish ends. But\r\nthose who made these charges in sincerity labored under an entire\r\nmisapprehension of his character and principles of action. At this day,\r\naided by the instructive history of his life, and by a perfect knowledge\r\nof his patriotism and devotion to truth and principle, as developed in his\r\nlong and spotless career, it is clearly seen that in the event under\r\nconsideration he but acted up to the high rule he had adopted, of making\r\nparty and sectional considerations secondary to the honor and interest of\r\nthe nation--an example which no pure and high-minded statesman can\r\nhesitate to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Massachusetts disapproved the course of Mr. Adams. By a\r\nsmall majority of Federal votes, it elected another person to take his\r\nplace in the Senate at the expiration of his term, and passed resolutions\r\ninstructing its Senators in Congress to oppose the measures of Mr.\r\nJefferson. Mr. Adams could not, consistently with his views of duty, obey\r\nthese instructions; and having no disposition to represent a body whose\r\nconfidence he did not retain, he resigned his seat in the Senate, in\r\nMarch, 1808.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Adams gave most of his days to the service of his country,\r\nyet he was fond of literary pursuits, and acquired, during his hours of\r\nrelaxation from sterner duties, a vast fund of classic lore and useful\r\nlearning. At an early day, he had become distinguished as a ripe scholar,\r\nand an impressive, dignified, and eloquent public speaker. His reputation\r\nfor literary and scholastic attainments quite equalled his fame as a\r\npolitician and statesman.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, on the death of President Willard, Mr. Adams was urged by several\r\ninfluential individuals, to be a candidate for the presidency of Cambridge\r\nUniversity. He declined the proffered honor. During the following year,\r\nhowever, he was appointed Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, in\r\nthat institution. He accepted the office, on condition that he should be\r\nallowed to discharge its duties at such times as his services in Congress\r\nwould permit. His inaugural address, on entering the professorship, was\r\ndelivered on the 12th of June, 1806. His lectures on rhetoric and oratory\r\nwere very popular. They were attended by large crowds from Boston and the\r\nsurrounding towns, in addition to the collegiate classes--a compliment\r\nwhich few of the professors since his day have received.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams continued his connection with the University, delivering\r\nlectures and conducting exercises in declamation, until July, 1809. \"It\r\nwas at this time, and as a member of one of the younger classes at\r\ncollege, that I first saw Mr. Adams, and listened to his well-remembered\r\nvoice from the chair of instruction; little anticipating, that after the\r\nlapse of forty years, my own humble voice would be heard, in the\r\nperformance of this mournful office. Some who now hear me will recollect\r\nthe deep interest with which these lectures were listened to, not merely\r\nby the youthful audience for which they were prepared, but by numerous\r\nvoluntary hearers from the neighborhood. They formed an era in the\r\nUniversity; and were, I believe, the first successful attempt, in this\r\ncountry, at this form of instruction in any department of literature. They\r\nwere collected and published in two volumes, completing the theoretical\r\npart of the subject. I think it may be fairly said, that they will bear a\r\nfavorable comparison with any treatise on the subject, at that time extant\r\nin our language. The standard of excellence, in every branch of critical\r\nlearning, has greatly advanced in the last forty years, but these lectures\r\nmay still be read with pleasure and instruction. Considered as a\r\nsystematic and academical treatise upon a subject which constituted the\r\nchief part of the intellectual education of the Greeks and Romans, these\r\nlectures, rapidly composed as they were delivered, and not revised by the\r\nauthor before publication, are not to be regarded in the light of a\r\nstandard performance. But let any statesman or jurist, even of the present\r\nday, in America or Europe--whose life, like Mr. Adams's, has been actively\r\npassed in professional and political engagements, at home and\r\nabroad--attempt, in the leisure of two or three summers--his mind filled\r\nwith all the great political topics of the day--to prepare a full course\r\nof lectures on any branch of literature, to be delivered to a difficult\r\nand scrutinizing, though in part a youthful audience, and then trust them\r\nto the ordeal of the press, and he will be prepared to estimate the task\r\nwhich was performed by Mr. Adams.\" [Footnote: Edward Everett's Eulogy on\r\nthe Life and Character of John Quincy Adams.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's devotion to literary pursuits was destined to an early\r\ntermination. On the 4th of March, 1809, Mr. Madison was inducted into the\r\noffice of President of the United Slates. It was at that time far from\r\nbeing an enviable position. At home the country was rent into contending\r\nfactions. Our foreign affairs were in a condition of the utmost\r\nperplexity, and evidently approaching a dangerous crisis. The murky clouds\r\nof war, which had for years overshadowed Europe, seemed rolling\r\nhitherward, filling the most sanguine and hopeful minds with deep\r\napprehension. Russia, under its youthful Emperor Alexander, was rising to\r\na prominent and influential position among the nations of Europe. Mr.\r\nMadison deemed it of great importance that the United States should be\r\nrepresented at that court by some individual eminent alike for talents,\r\nexperience, and influence. John Quincy Adams was selected for the mission.\r\nIn March, 1809, he was appointed Minister to Russia, and the summer\r\nfollowing, sailed for St. Petersburgh.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, our relations with Great Britain became every day more\r\ndubious. While striving, in every honorable manner, to come to terms of\r\nreconciliation, President Madison was making rapid preparations for war.\r\nThe people of the United States, deprived by the non-intercourse act of\r\nthe cheap productions of England, began to turn their attention and\r\ncapital to domestic manufactures. At length the American Government\r\ndemanded peremptorily, that the restrictions of Great Britain and France\r\non our commerce should be abrogated; war being the alternative of a\r\nrefusal. The French emperor gave satisfactory assurances that the Berlin\r\ndecree should be withdrawn. The English government hesitated, equivocated,\r\nand showed evident disinclination to take any decided step.\r\n\r\n\"In this doubtful state of connexion between America and England, an\r\naccidental collision took place between vessels of the respective\r\ncountries, tending much to inflame and widen the existing differences. An\r\nEnglish sloop-of-war, the Little Belt, commanded by Capt. Bingham,\r\ndescried a ship off the American coast, and made sail to come up with it;\r\nbut finding it a frigate, and dubious of its nation, he retired. The\r\nother, which proved to be American, the President, under Capt. Rogers,\r\npursued in turn. Both captains hailed nearly together; and both, instead\r\nof replying, hailed again; and from words, as it were, came to blows,\r\nwithout explanation. Capt. Bingham lost upwards of thirty men, and his\r\nship suffered severely. A Court of Inquiry was ordered on the conduct of\r\nCapt. Rogers, which decided that it had been satisfactorily proved to the\r\ncourt, that Capt. Rogers hailed the Little Belt first, that his hail was\r\nnot satisfactorily answered, that the Little Belt fired the first gun, and\r\nthat it was without previous provocation or justifiable cause.\" [Footnote:\r\nLives of the Presidents.]\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made after this, to preserve the peace of the two\r\ncountries, but in vain. England, it is true, withdrew her obnoxious Orders\r\nin Council. It was, however, too late. Before intelligence of this repeal\r\nreached the shores of the United States, war was declared by Congress, on\r\nthe 18th of June, 1812.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular war. Although strenuously opposed by portions of the\r\nEastern States, as destructive to their commerce, yet with the mass of the\r\npeople throughout the Union, it was deemed justifiable and indispensible.\r\nA long series of insults and injuries on the part of Great Britain--the\r\nseizure and confiscation of our ships and cargoes; the impressing of our\r\nseamen, under circumstances of the most irritating description; and the\r\nadoption of numerous measures to the injury of our interests--had fully\r\nprepared the public mind in the United States, with the exception of a\r\nsmall minority, to enter upon this war with zeal and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWith occasional reverses, general success attended our arms in every\r\ndirection. On land and on sea, the American eagle led to victory. The\r\ncombatants were worthy of each other. Of the same original stock--of the\r\nsame stern, unyielding material--their contests were bloody and\r\ndestructive in the extreme. But the younger nation, inspirited by a sense\r\nof wrongs endured, and of the justness of its cause, bore away the palm,\r\nand plucked from the brow of its more aged competitor many a laurel yet\r\ngreen from the ensanguined fields of Europe. In scores of hotly-contested\r\nbattles, the British lion, unused as it was to cower before a foe, was\r\ncompelled to \"lick the dust\" in defeat. At York, at Chippewa, at Fort\r\nErie, at Lundy's Lane, at New Orleans, on Lake Champlain, on Lake Erie,\r\non the broad ocean, Great Britain and the world were taught lessons of\r\nAmerican valor, skill, and energy, which ages will not obliterate.\r\n\r\nThis war, though prosecuted at the expense of many valuable lives, and of\r\na vast public debt, was, unquestionably, highly beneficial to the United\r\nStates. It convinced all doubters that our government was abundantly able\r\nto resent aggressions, and to maintain its rights against the assaults of\r\nany nation on earth. This reputation has been of great service in\r\nprotecting our commerce, and commanding respect for our flag, throughout\r\nthe world. But the chief benefit of the war was the development of our\r\ninternal resources, which, after all, form the great fountain of the\r\nwealth, strength, and permanence of a nation. Deprived by the embargo, the\r\nnon-intercourse act, and the ensuing hostilities, of all foreign\r\nimportation of goods, the American people were compelled to supply\r\nthemselves by their own industry and ingenuity, with those articles for\r\nwhich they had always before been dependent on their transatlantic\r\nneighbors. Thus was laid the foundation of that system of domestic\r\nmanufactures which is destined to make the United States the greatest\r\nproductive mart among men, and to bring into its lap the wealth of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' ARRIVAL AT ST. PETERSBURG--HIS LETTERS TO HIS SON ON\r\nTHE BIBLE--HIS RELIGIOUS OPINIONS--RUSSIA OFFERS MEDIATION\r\nBETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES--PROCEEDS TO\r\nGHENT TO NEGOTIATE FOR PEACE--VISITS PARIS--APPOINTED MINISTER\r\nAT ST. JAMES--ARRIVES IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams arrived at St. Petersburg, as Minister Plenipotentiary from the\r\nUnited States, in the autumn of 1809. Twenty-eight years before, while a\r\nlad of fourteen, he was at the same place, as private secretary to Mr.\r\nDana, the American Minister. The promising boy returned to the northern\r\ncapital a mature man, ripe in experience, wisdom, patriotism, and prepared\r\nto serve his country in the highest walks of diplomacy. So truly had the\r\nfar-seeing Washington prophesied in 1795:--\"I shall be much mistaken if,\r\nin as short a time as can well be expected, he is not found at the head of\r\nthe diplomatic corps, be the government administered by whomsoever the\r\npeople may choose!\"\r\n\r\nThe United Slates, though but little known in Russia at that period, was\r\nstill looked upon with favor, as a nation destined, in due time, to exert\r\na great influence upon the affairs of the world. Mr. Adams was received\r\nwith marked respect at the Court of St. Petersburg. His familiarity with\r\nthe French and German languages--the former the diplomatic language of\r\nEurope--his literary acquirements, his perfect knowledge of the political\r\nrelations of the civilized world, his plain appearance, and republican\r\nsimplicity of manners, in the midst of the gorgeous embassies of other\r\nnations, enabled him to make a striking and favorable impression on the\r\nEmperor Alexander and his Court. The Emperor, charmed by his varied\r\nqualities, admitted him to terms of personal intimacy seldom granted to\r\nthe most favored individuals.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Russia, the death of Judge Cushing caused a\r\nvacancy on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States. President\r\nMadison nominated Mr. Adams to the distinguished office. The nomination\r\nwas confirmed by the Senate, but he declined its acceptance.\r\n\r\nA circumstance occurred at this time, which attracted the attention of Mr.\r\nAdams. The Russian Minister of the Interior, then advanced in years,\r\nhaving received many valuable presents while in office, became troubled\r\nwith scruples of conscience, in regard to the disposal he should make of\r\nthem. He at length calculated the value of all his gifts, and paid the sum\r\ninto the imperial treasury. This transaction made a deep impression on Mr.\r\nAdams, and probably led him to the resolution of never accepting gifts. In\r\norder to act with that freedom of bias which he deemed indispensable to\r\nthe faithful discharge of public duty, he endeavored to avoid, as far as\r\npossible, laying himself under obligations to any man. When a certain\r\nbookseller once sent him an elegant copy of the Scriptures, he kept the\r\nbook, but returned its full equivalent in money.\r\n\r\nWhile sojourning at St. Petersburg, Mr. Adams wrote a series of letters to\r\na son at school in Massachusetts, on the value of the Bible, and the\r\nimportance of its daily perusal. Since his decease they have been\r\npublished in a volume, entitled \"Letters of John Quincy Adams to his son,\r\non the Bible and its teachings.\" \"Their purpose is the inculcation of a\r\nlove and reverence for the Holy Scriptures, and a delight in their perusal\r\nand study. Throughout his long life, Mr. Adams was himself a daily and\r\ndevout reader of the Scriptures, and delighted in comparing and\r\nconsidering them in the various languages with which he was familiar,\r\nhoping thereby to acquire a nicer and clearer appreciation of their\r\nmeaning. The Bible was emphatically his counsel and monitor through life,\r\nand the fruits of its guidance are seen in the unsullied character which\r\nhe bore, through the turbid waters of political contention, to his final\r\nearthly rest. Though long and fiercely opposed and contemned in life he\r\nleft no man behind him who would wish to fix a stain on the name he has\r\ninscribed so high on the roll of his country's most gifted and illustrious\r\nsons. The intrinsic value of these letters, their familiar and lucid\r\nstyle, their profound and comprehensive views, their candid and reverent\r\nspirit, must win for them a large measure of the public attention and\r\nesteem. But, apart from even this, the testimony so unconsciously borne by\r\ntheir pure-minded and profoundly learned author, to the truth and\r\nexcellence of the Christian faith and records, will not be lightly\r\nregarded. It is no slight testimonial to the verity and worth of\r\nChristianity, that in all ages since its promulgation, the great mass of\r\nthose who have risen to eminence by their profound wisdom, integrity, and\r\nphilanthropy, have recognized and reverenced, in Jesus of Nazareth, the\r\nSon of the living God. To the names of Augustine, Xavier, Fenelon,\r\nMilton, Newton, Locke, Lavater, Howard, Chateaubriand, and their\r\nthousands of compeers in Christian faith, among the world's wisest and\r\nnoblest, it is not without pride that the American may add, from among his\r\ncountrymen, those of such men as WASHINGTON, JAY, PATRICK HENRY, and JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS.\" [Footnote: Preface to \"Letters of John Quincy Adams to his\r\nSon, on the Bible and its Teachings.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was a practical Christian. This is proved by his spotless life,\r\nhis strict honesty and integrity, his devotion to duty, his faithful\r\nobedience to the dictates of conscience, at whatever sacrifice, his\r\nreverence of God, of Christ, his respect for religion and its\r\ninstitutions, and recognition of its claims and responsibilities. Although\r\na Unitarian [Footnote: Mr. Adams was a member of the Unitarian Church in\r\nQuincy, Mass., at his death.] in his belief of doctrines, yet he was no\r\nsectarian. In religion, as in politics, he was independent of parties. He\r\nwould become linked to no sect in such manner as to prevent him from\r\ngranting his countenance and assistance wherever he thought proper. He was\r\na frequent attendant at Presbyterian and Episcopalian churches, and was\r\nliberal in his contributions to these and other denominations; it being\r\nhis great desire to aid in building up Christianity, and not a sect.\r\n\r\nThe influence which Mr. Adams had obtained at St. Petersburg, with the\r\nEmperor and his Court, was turned to the best account. It laid the\r\nfoundation of those amicable relations which have ever characterized the\r\nintercourse of that government with the United States. To this source,\r\nalso, is unquestionably to be attributed the offer, by the Emperor\r\nAlexander, of mediation between Great Britain and the United States. This\r\noffer was accepted by the American Government, and Mr. Adams, in\r\nconnection with Messrs. Gallatin and Bayard, was appointed by the\r\nPresident to take charge of the negotiation. The latter gentlemen joined\r\nMr. Adams at St. Petersburg, in July, 1813. Conferences were held by the\r\nCommissioners with Count Romanzoff, the Chancellor of the Russian Empire,\r\nwith a view to open negotiations. The British Government, however, refused\r\nto treat under the mediation of Russia; but proposed at the same time to\r\nmeet American Commissioners either at London or Gottenburg. Messrs.\r\nGallatin and Bayard withdrew from St. Petersburg in January, 1814,\r\nleaving Mr. Adams in the discharge of his duties as resident Minister.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of the British Ministry to negotiate for peace, at London\r\nor Gottenburg was accepted by the United States. Mr. Adams and Messrs.\r\nBayard, Clay, Russell, and Gallatin, were appointed Commissioners, and\r\ndirected to proceed to Gottenburg for that purpose. Mr. Adams received\r\nhis instructions in April, 1814; and as soon as preparations for departure\r\ncould be made, took passage for Stockholm. After repeated delays, on\r\naccount of the difficulties of navigation at that early season in the\r\nnorthern seas, he arrived at that city on the 25th of May. Learning there\r\nthat the place for the meeting of the Commissioners had been changed to\r\nGhent, in Belgium, Mr. Adams proceeded to Gottenburg. From thence he\r\nembarked on board an American sloop-of-war, which had conveyed Messrs.\r\nClay and Russell from the United States, and landing at Texel, proceeded\r\nimmediately to Ghent, where he arrived on the 24th of June.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing negotiation, Mr. Adams was placed at the head of the\r\nAmerican Commissioners. They were men of unsurpassed talents and skill, in\r\nwhose hands neither the welfare nor the honor of the United States could\r\nsuffer. In conducting this negotiation, they exhibited an ability, a tact,\r\nan understanding of international law, and a knowledge of the best\r\ninterests of their country, which attracted the favorable attention both\r\nof Europe and America. Their \"Notes\" with the British Commissioners,\r\nexhibited a dignified firmness and manly moderation, with a power of\r\nargument, and force of reasoning, which highly elevated their reputation,\r\nand that of their country, in the estimation of European statesmen. The\r\nMarquis of Wellesley declared in the British House of Lords, that, \"in\r\nhis opinion the American Commissioners had shown the most astonishing\r\nsuperiority over the British, during the whole of the correspondence.\"\r\nTheir despatches to the Government at home, describing and explaining the\r\nprogress of the negotiation in its several stages, gave the highest\r\nsatisfaction to the people of the United States. It was declared in the\r\npublic prints, that they sustained the honor of the Union as ably at\r\nGhent as the patriotism and bravery of its defenders had been established\r\nby its seamen on the ocean, and its troops in their battles with\r\n\"Wellington's Invincibles.\" A good share of these encomiums of right\r\nbelongs to Mr. Adams, who, from his knowledge of foreign affairs, and\r\nexperience in diplomacy, as well as acknowledged talents, took a leading\r\npart in the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe American commissioners were treated with marks of highest respect, by\r\nthe citizens of Ghent, and the public authorities of that town. On the\r\nanniversary of the Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts, at Ghent, they were\r\nunanimously elected members of the institution, and were invited to attend\r\nand unite in the exercises of the occasion. An oration on the objects of\r\nthe institution was delivered. In the evening, a sumptuous banquet was\r\nserved up to a numerous company. After the removal of the cloth, among the\r\ntoasts given, was the following, by the Intendant of Ghent:--\r\n\r\n\"Our distinguished guests and fellow-members, the American Ministers: May\r\nthey succeed in making an honorable peace, to secure the liberty and\r\nindependence of their country.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was received with immense applause. The band struck up\r\n\"Hail Columbia,\" and the company was filled with enthusiasm. It was some\r\nminutes before the tumult sufficiently subsided to admit of a response.\r\nMr. Adams then arose, and, in behalf of the American Legation, returned\r\nthanks for the very flattering manner in which they had been treated by\r\nthe municipality of Ghent, and particularly for the unexpected honor\r\nconferred upon them by the Academy. After making some pertinent remarks on\r\nthe importance and usefulness of the Fine Arts, he concluded by offering\r\nas a toast--\"The Intendant of the city of Ghent.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Commissioners were Lord Gambier, Henry Goulburn, and Wm.\r\nAdams. The negotiations opened dubiously. The demands of the British\r\nMinisters were at first of such a character, that it was impossible to\r\ncomply with them, with any regard to the honor or welfare of the United\r\nStates. They insisted that the line separating the United States from the\r\nCanadas, should run on the southern borders of all the lakes from Ontario\r\nto Superior--that the American Government should keep no armed force on\r\nthese lakes, nor maintain any military posts on their borders, while the\r\nBritish should have the privilege of establishing such posts wherever they\r\nthought proper, on the southern shores of the lakes and connecting rivers,\r\nand maintaining a navy on their waters--that a large part of the district\r\nof Maine should be relinquished and ceded to England, to permit a direct\r\nroute of communication between Halifax and Quebec--that the right of\r\nsearch should be granted to British ships-of-war--together with many\r\nother terms equally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe letters of the American Commissioners to the Government at home, in\r\nthe early stages of the proceedings, were couched in desponding tones.\r\nThey gave it as their opinion that no terms of peace could be agreed upon.\r\nBut the demands of the English Plenipotentiaries were met in a manner so\r\ndecided, and reasons were offered for non-compliance so cogent and\r\nincontrovertible, that they were compelled to recede, and come to terms of\r\na more reasonable description. Moreover the British nation was heartily\r\nsick of foreign wars, which plunged the Government into debt, sacrificed\r\nthe lives of its subjects, crippled their manufactories, and secured them,\r\nin fact, nothing! At length, after a protracted negotiation of six months,\r\narticles of peace were signed by the British and American Commissioners,\r\non the 24th of December, 1814.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of this event, at Ghent, was in a manner somewhat\r\npeculiar. Mr. Todd, one of the Secretaries of the American Commissioners,\r\nand son-in-law of President Madison, had invited several gentlemen,\r\nAmericans and others, to take refreshments with him on the 24th of\r\nDecember. At noon, after having spent some time in pleasant conversation,\r\nthe refreshments entered, and Mr. Todd said,--\"It is 12 o'clock. Well,\r\ngentlemen, I announce to you that peace has been made and signed between\r\nAmerica and England.\" In a few moments, Messrs. Gallatin, Clay, Carroll\r\nand Hughes entered, and confirmed the annunciation. This intelligence was\r\nreceived with a burst of joy by all present. The news soon spread through\r\nthe town, and gave general satisfaction to the citizens.\r\n\r\nAt Paris, the intelligence was hailed with acclamations. In the evening\r\nthe theatres resounded with cries of \"God save the Americans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States the news of peace spread with the speed of the wind.\r\nEverywhere it excited the most lively emotions of joy. Processions,\r\norations, bonfires, illuminations, attested the gratification of the\r\npeople, and showed that, notwithstanding the general success which had\r\nattended our arms, they viewed peace as one of the highest blessings a\r\nnation can enjoy.\r\n\r\nRecognizing in this important event the hand of a wise and gracious\r\noverruling Providence, the hearts of a great Christian nation turned in\r\ngratitude toward God. President Madison issued the following proclamation\r\nfor a day of thanksgiving:--\r\n\r\n\"The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States have, by a\r\njoint resolution, signified their desire that a day may be recommended, to\r\nbe observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity,\r\nas a day of thanksgiving and of devout acknowledgments to Almighty God,\r\nfor his great goodness, manifested in restoring to them the blessings of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of\r\nthe Great Disposer of events, and of the destiny of nations, than the\r\npeople of the United Slates. His kind providence originally conducted them\r\nto one of the best portions of the dwelling place allowed for the great\r\nfamily of the human race. He protected and cherished them under all the\r\ndifficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their early days.\r\nUnder his fostering care, their habits, their sentiments and their\r\npursuits prepared them for a transition in due time to a state of\r\nindependence and self-government. In the arduous struggle by which it was\r\nattained, they were distinguished by multiplied tokens of his benign\r\ninterposition. During the interval which succeeded, he reared them into\r\nthe strength, and endowed them with the resources, which have enabled them\r\nto assert their national rights, and to enhance their national character,\r\nin another arduous conflict, which is now happily terminated by a peace\r\nand reconciliation with those who have been our enemies. And to the same\r\nDivine Author of every good and perfect gift we are indebted for all those\r\nprivileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly\r\nenjoyed in this favored land.\r\n\r\n\"It is for blessings such as these, and more especially for the\r\nrestoration of the blessings of peace, that I now recommend that the\r\nsecond Thursday in April next, be set apart as a day on which the people\r\nof every religious denomination may in their solemn assemblies unite their\r\nhearts and their voices, in a free-will offering, to their Heavenly\r\nBenefactor, of their homage of thanksgiving and their songs of praise.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Ghent, the American Commissioners gave a public dinner to\r\nthe British Ambassadors, at which the Intendant of Ghent, and numerous\r\nstaff officers of the Hanoverian service, were present. Everything\r\nindicated that the most perfect reconciliation had taken place between the\r\ntwo nations. Lord Gambier had arisen to give, as the first toast, \"The\r\nUnited States of North America,\" but he was prevented by the courtesy of\r\nMr. Adams, who gave \"His Majesty, the King of England\"--on which the music\r\nstruck up \"God save the King.\" Lord Gambier gave as the second toast,\r\n\"The United States of North America,\" and the music played \"Hail Columbia.\"\r\nCount H. Von Sheinhuyer presented as a toast--\"The Pacificators of the\r\nStates--May their union contribute to the happiness of the Department\r\nwhich is confided to my government; and may their Excellencies communicate\r\nto their Governments the lively interest which those under me take in\r\ntheir reconciliation.\" Mr. Adams and Lord Gambier both begged the\r\nIntendant to certify to the city of Ghent the gratitude of the\r\nMinisters, for the attention which the inhabitants had shown them during\r\ntheir residence in their midst.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded their labors at Ghent by signing the treaty of peace,\r\nMr. Adams, together with Messrs. Albert Gallatin and Henry Clay, was\r\ndirected to proceed to London, for the purpose of entering into\r\nnegotiations for a treaty of commerce with Great Britain. Before leaving\r\nthe continent, Mr. Adams visited Paris, where he witnessed the return of\r\nNapoleon from Elbe, and his meteoric career during the Hundred Days. Here\r\nhe was joined in March, 1815, by his family, after a long and perilous\r\njourney from St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May, Mr. Adams arrived in London and joined Messrs.\r\nGallatin and Clay, who had already entered upon the preliminaries of the\r\nproposed commercial convention with Great Britain. In the mean time, Mr.\r\nAdams had received official notice of his appointment as Minister to the\r\nCourt of St. James. On the 3d of July, 1815, the convention for regulating\r\nthe commercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain was\r\nconcluded, and duly signed. It was afterwards ratified by both\r\nGovernments, and has formed the basis of commerce and trade between the\r\ntwo countries, to the present time. At the conclusion of these\r\nnegotiations, Messrs. Gallatin and Clay returned to the United States, and\r\nMr. Adams remained in London, in his capacity as resident Minister.\r\n\r\nThus had the prediction of Washington been fulfilled. In \"as short a time\r\nas could well be expected,\" John Quincy Adams, as the well-merited reward\r\nof faithful services, had attained to the head of the Diplomatic Corps of\r\nthe United States. His career had been singularly successful; and his\r\nelevation to the highest foreign stations received the general approbation\r\nof his countrymen. His simple habits, his plain appearance, his untiring\r\nindustry, his richly stored mind, his unbending integrity, his general\r\nintercourse and correspondence with foreign courts and diplomatists of the\r\ngreatest distinction, all tended to elevate, in a high degree, the\r\nAmerican character, in the estimation of European nations.\r\n\r\nThe impression he made in the most eminent circles during his residence in\r\nLondon, as a statesman of unsurpassed general information, and critical\r\nknowledge of the politics of the world, was retained for years afterwards.\r\nMr. Rush, who was subsequently Minister to Great Britain, in an account of\r\na dinner party at Lord Castlereagh's, notes a corroborating incident: \"At\r\ntable, I had on my left the Saxon Minister, Baron Just. * * * * * * He\r\ninquired of me for Mr. Adams, whom he had known well, and of whom he spoke\r\nhighly. He said that he knew the politics of all Europe.\" [Footnote:\r\nRush's Residence at the Court of London.]\r\n\r\n\"It was while Mr. Adams was Minister of the United States in London, that\r\nit was my personal good fortune to be admitted to his intimacy and\r\nfriendship. Being then in London on private business, and having some\r\nprevious acquaintance with Mr. Adams, I found in his house an ever kind\r\nwelcome, and in his intercourse and conversation unfailing attraction and\r\nimprovement. Accustomed as he had been from earliest youth to the society\r\nof the most eminent persons in Europe, alike in station and in ability,\r\nMr. Adams never lost the entire simplicity of his own habits and\r\ncharacter. Under an exterior of, at times, almost repulsive coldness,\r\ndwelt a heart as warm, sympathies as quick, and affections as overflowing,\r\nas ever animated any bosom. His tastes, too, were all refined. Literature\r\nand art were familiar and dear to him, and hence it was that his society\r\nwas at once so agreeable and so improving. At his hospitable board, I have\r\nlistened to disquisitions from his lips on poetry, especially the dramas\r\nof Shakspeare, music, painting, sculpture--of rare excellence, and\r\nuntiring interest. The extent of his knowledge, indeed, and its accuracy,\r\nin all branches, were not less remarkable than the complete command which\r\nhe appeared to possess over all his varied stores of learning and\r\ninformation. A critical scholar, alike in the dead languages, in French,\r\nin German, in Italian, not less than in English--he could draw at will\r\nfrom the wealth of all these tongues to illustrate any particular topic,\r\nor to explain any apparent difficulty. There was no literary work of merit\r\nin any of these languages, of which he could not render a satisfactory\r\naccount; there was no fine painting or statue, of which he did not know\r\nthe details and the history; there was not even an opera, or a celebrated\r\nmusical composer, of which or of whom he could not point out the\r\ndistinguishing merits and the chief compositions. Yet he was a\r\nhard-working, assiduous man of business, in his particular vocation, and a\r\nmore regular, punctual, comprehensive, voluminous diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence than his no country can probably boast of; and it is\r\nthought the more necessary to note this fact, because sometimes an opinion\r\nprevails that graver pursuits must necessarily exclude attention to what\r\nused to be called the \"humanities\" of education--those ornamental and\r\ngraceful acquirements, which, as Mr. Adams well proved, not only are not\r\ninconsistent with, but greatly adorn, the weightier matters of the law and\r\nof diplomacy. I could dwell with much satisfaction upon the memory and\r\nincidents of the days to which I am now adverting, but am admonished, by\r\nthe length to which these remarks have already extended, that I may not\r\nloiter.\" [Footnote: Eulogy on John Quincy Adams, by Charles King.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE--ARRIVES IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES--PUBLIC DINNERS IN NEW YORK AND BOSTON--TAKES UP HIS RESIDENCE IN\r\nWASHINGTON--DEFENDS GEN. JACKSON IN THE FLORIDA INVASION--RECOGNITION OF\r\nSOUTH AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE--GREEK REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madison, after serving his country eight years as President, in a\r\nmost perilous period of its history, retired to private life, followed by\r\nthe respect and gratitude of the people of the United States. He was\r\nsucceeded by James Monroe, who was inaugurated on the 4th of March, 1817.\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe was a politician of great moderation.  It was his desire, on\r\nentering the presidency, to heal the unhappy dissensions which had\r\ndistracted the country from the commencement of its government, and\r\nconciliate and unite the conflicting political parties. In forming his\r\ncabinet, he consulted eminent individuals of different parties, in various\r\nsections of the Union, expressing these views. Among others, he addressed\r\nGen. Jackson, who, on account of his successful military career, was then\r\nrising rapidly into public notice. In his reply the general remarked:--\r\n\r\n\"Everything depends on the selection of your ministry. In every selection,\r\nparty and party feeling should be avoided. Now is the time to exterminate\r\nthat monster, called party spirit. By selecting characters most\r\nconspicuous for their probity, virtue, capacity, and firmness, without any\r\nregard to party, you will go far, if not entirely, to eradicate those\r\nfeelings, which on former occasions, threw so many obstacles in the way of\r\ngovernment, and, perhaps, have the pleasure and honor of uniting a people\r\nheretofore politically divided. The Chief Magistrate of a great and\r\npowerful nation, should never indulge in party feelings.\"\r\n\r\nAdmirable advice! Sentiments worthy an exalted American statesman! The\r\nPresident of a vast Republic, should indeed know nothing of the interest\r\nof party in contradistinction to the interest of the whole people; and\r\nshould exercise his power, his patronage, and his influence, not to\r\nstrengthen factions, and promote the designs of political demagogues, but\r\nto develop and nourish internal resources, the only sinews of national\r\nprosperity, and diffuse abroad sentiments of true patriotism, liberality,\r\nand philanthropy. No suggestions more admirable could have been made by\r\nGen. Jackson, and none could have been more worthy the consideration of\r\nMr. Monroe and his successors in the presidential chair.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out his plans of conciliation, President Monroe selected John\r\nQuincy Adams for the responsible post of Secretary of State. Mr. Adams had\r\nnever been an active partizan. In his career as Senator, both in\r\nMassachusetts and in Washington, during Mr. Jefferson's administration, he\r\nhad satisfactorily demonstrated his ability to rise above party\r\nconsiderations, in the discharge of great and important duties. And his\r\nlong absence from the country had kept him free from personal, party, and\r\nsectional bias, and peculiarly fitted him to take the first station in the\r\ncabinet of a President aiming to unite his countrymen in fraternal bonds\r\nof political amity.\r\n\r\nReferring to this appointment, Mr. Monroe wrote Gen. Jackson as follows,\r\nunder date of March 1, 1817:--\"I shall take a person for the Department of\r\nState from the eastward; and Mr. Adams, by long service in our diplomatic\r\nconcerns appearing to be entitled to the preference, supported by his\r\nacknowledged abilities and integrity, his nomination will go to the\r\nSenate.\" Gen. Jackson, in his reply, remarks:--\"I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying you have made the best selection to fill the Department of State\r\nthat could be made. Mr. Adams, in the hour of difficulty, will be an able\r\nhelpmate, and I am convinced his appointment will afford general\r\nsatisfaction.\" This prediction was well founded. The consummate ability\r\nexhibited by Mr. Adams in foreign negotiations had elevated him to a high\r\nposition in the estimation of his countrymen. His selection for the State\r\nDepartment was received with very general satisfaction throughout the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOn receiving notice of his appointment to this responsible office, Mr.\r\nAdams, with his family, embarked for the United States, on board the\r\npacket-ship Washington, and landed in New York on the 6th of August, 1817.\r\n\r\nA few days after his arrival, a public dinner was given Mr. Adams, in\r\nTammany Hall, New York. The room was elegantly decorated. In the centre\r\nwas a handsome circle of oak leaves, roses, and flags--the whole\r\nrepresenting, with much effect, our happy Union--and from the centre of\r\nwhich, as from her native woods, appeared our eagle, bearing in her beak\r\nthis impressive scroll:--\r\n\r\n  \"Columbia, great Republic, thou art blest,\r\n  While Empires droop, and Monarchs sink to rest.\"\r\n\r\nGov. De Witt Clinton, the Mayor of New York, and about two hundred\r\ncitizens of the highest respectability, sat down to the table. Among other\r\nspeeches made on the occasion, was the following from an English\r\ngentleman, a Mr. Fearon, of London:--\r\n\r\n\"As several gentlemen have volunteered songs, I would beg leave to offer a\r\nsentiment, which I am sure will meet the hearty concurrence of all\r\npresent. But, previous to which, I desire to express the high satisfaction\r\nwhich this day's entertainment has afforded me. Though a native of Great\r\nBritain, and but a few days in the United States, I am for the first time\r\nin my life in a free country, surrounded by free men; and when I look at\r\nthe inscription which decorates your eagle, I rejoice that I have been\r\ndestined to see this day.  A great number of the enlightened portion of my\r\ncountrymen advocate your cause--admire your principles. And though we\r\nhave, unfortunately, been engaged in a war, I trust the result has taught\r\nwisdom to both parties. In your political institutions you have set a\r\nnoble example, which, if followed throughout the world, will rescue\r\nmankind from the dominion of those tyrants who jeer at the destruction\r\nwhich they produce--\r\n\r\n  'Like the moonbeams on the blasted heath,\r\n  Mocking its desolation.'\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, in conclusion, I beg to express the delight which I feel, and\r\npropose to you as a toast--May the United States be an example to the\r\nworld; and may civil and religious liberty cover the earth, as the waters\r\ndo the channels of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nA public dinner was also given Mr. Adams on his arrival in Boston. Mr.\r\nGray presided, and Messrs. Otis, Blake, and Mason, acted as Vice\r\nPresidents. His father, the venerable ex-President John Adams, was present\r\nas a guest. Among other toasts given on the occasion, were the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"The United States.--May our public officers, abroad and at home, continue\r\nto be distinguished for integrity, talents, and patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Commissioners at Ghent.--The negotiations for peace have been\r\ndeclared, in the British House of Lords, to wear the stamp of American\r\nsuperiority.\"\r\n\r\n\"American Manufactures.--A sure and necessary object for the security of\r\nAmerican independence.\"\r\n\r\nThis occasion must have been one of great interest to the patriarch John\r\nAdams, then more than four-score years of age. Nearly forty years before,\r\nhe had said of his son:--\"He behaves like a man!\" That son, in the prime\r\nof his days, had recently been called from foreign service, where he had\r\nobtained accumulated honors, to fill the highest station in the gift of\r\nthe Executive of his country. The people of two continents would now unite\r\nwith the venerable sage, in repeating the declaration--\"He behaves like a\r\nman!\" The patriarch stood upon the verge of the grave. But as the sun of\r\nhis existence was gently and calmly sinking beneath the horizon, lo! its\r\nbeams were reflected in their pristine brightness by another orb, born\r\nfrom its bosom, which was steadily ascending to the zenith of earthly\r\nfame!\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams took up his residence at Washington, and entered upon\r\nhis duties as Secretary of State, in September, 1817.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years of President Monroe's administration, Mr. Adams\r\ndischarged the duties of the state department, with a fidelity and success\r\nwhich received not only the unqualified approbation of the President, but\r\nof the whole country. To him that office was no sinecure. His labors were\r\nincessant. He spared no pains to qualify himself to discuss, with\r\nconsummate skill, whatever topics legitimately claimed his attention. The\r\nPresident, the cabinet, the people, imposed implicit trust in his ability\r\nto promote the interests of the nation in all matters of diplomacy, and\r\nconfided unreservedly in his pure American feelings and love of country.\r\nPerfectly familiar as he was with the political condition of the world,\r\nMr. Monroe entrusted him, without hesitation, with the management of the\r\nforeign policy of the Government, during his administration.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1817, the Seminole and a portion of the Creek Indians\r\ncommenced depredations on the frontiers of Georgia and Alabama. Troops\r\nwere sent to reduce them, under Gen. Gaines. His force being too weak to\r\nbring them to subjection, Gen. Jackson was ordered to take the field with\r\na more numerous army, with which he overran the Indian country. Believing\r\nit necessary to enter Florida, then a Spanish territory, for the more\r\neffectual subjugation of the Indians, he did not hesitate to pursue them\r\nthither. The Spanish authorities protested against the invasion of their\r\ndomains, and offered some opposition. Gen. Jackson persisted, and in the\r\nresult, took possession of St. Marks and Pensacola, and sent the Spanish\r\nauthorities and troops to Havana.\r\n\r\nAmong the prisoners taken in this expedition, were a Scotchman and an\r\nEnglishman, named Arbuthnot and Ambrister. They were British subjects,\r\nbut were charged with supplying the Indians with arms and munitions of\r\nwar; stirring them up against the whites, and acting as spies. On these\r\ncharges they were tried by a court martial, of which Gen. Gaines was\r\nPresident--found guilty--condemned to death, and executed on the 27th of\r\nApril, 1818.\r\n\r\nThese transactions of Gen. Jackson caused great excitement throughout the\r\nUnited States, and subjected him to no little blame. The subject excited\r\nmuch debate in Congress. A resolution censuring him for his summary\r\nproceedings was introduced, but voted down by a large majority. In Mr.\r\nMonroe's cabinet, there was a strong feeling against Gen. Jackson. The\r\nPresident, and all the members, with a single exception, were disposed to\r\nhold him responsible for having transcended his orders. Hon. Wm. H.\r\nCrawford, who was in Mr. Monroe's cabinet at that time, in a letter to\r\nMr. Forsyth, says:--\"Mr. Calhoun's proposition in the cabinet was, that\r\nGen. Jackson should be punished in some form, or reprimanded in some\r\nform.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams alone vindicated Gen. Jackson. He insisted that inasmuch as the\r\nGovernment had ordered him to pursue the enemy into Florida, if necessary,\r\nthey were responsible for the acts of the American general, in the\r\nexercise of the discretionary power with which he had been clothed.\r\nSeveral cabinet meetings were held on the subject, in July, 1818, in which\r\nthe whole matter was thoroughly discussed. Mr. Adams succeeded at length\r\nin bringing the President into the adoption of his views, which Mr. Monroe\r\nsubstantially embodied in his next annual message to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the execution of Arbuthnot and Ambrister, excited\r\nthe highest indignation in England. The people viewed it as a violation of\r\nthe rights of British subjects, and an insult to their nation, and were\r\nready to rush to war.  Lord Castlereagh declared to Mr. Rush, the\r\nAmerican Minister, that had the English cabinet but held up a finger, war\r\nwould have been declared against the United States. But so able and\r\nconvincing were the arguments which Mr. Adams directed Mr. Rush to lay\r\nbefore the British Ministers, in defence of the proceedings of Gen.\r\nJackson, that they became convinced there was no just cause of war between\r\nthe two countries, and exerted their influence against any movement in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, 1819, a treaty was concluded at Washington,\r\nbetween the United States and Spain, by which East and West Florida, with\r\nthe adjacent islands, were ceded to the Union. The negotiations which\r\nresulted in the consummation of the treaty, were conducted by Mr. Adams\r\nand Luis de Onis the Spanish Ambassador. This treaty was very\r\nadvantageous to the United States. It brought to a close a controversy\r\nwith Spain, of many years' standing, which had defied all the exertions of\r\nformer administrations to adjust, and placed our relations with that\r\ncountry on the most amicable footing. In effecting this reconciliation,\r\nMr. Adams deserved and received a high share of credit.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the independence of the Spanish South American\r\nProvinces, by the Government of the United States, took place during Mr.\r\nAdams's administration of the State Department. The honor of first\r\nproposing this recognition, in the Congress of the United States, and of\r\nadvocating it with unsurpassed eloquence and zeal, belongs to the\r\npatriotic Henry Clay. Mainly by his influence, the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in 1820, passed the following resolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the House of Representatives participate with the people\r\nof the United States, in the deep interest which they feel for the success\r\nof the Spanish Provinces of South America, which are struggling to\r\nestablish their liberty and independence.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this House will give its constitutional support to the\r\nPresident of the United States, whenever he may deem it expedient to\r\nrecognize the sovereignty and independence of any of said Provinces.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams at first hesitated on this subject. Not that he was opposed to\r\nthe diffusion of the blessings of freedom to the oppressed. No man was a\r\nmore ardent lover of liberty, or was more anxious that its institutions\r\nshould be established throughout the earth, at the earliest practicable\r\nmoment. But he had many and serious doubts whether the people of the South\r\nAmerican Provinces were capable of originating and maintaining an\r\nenlightened self-government.  There was a lack of general intelligence\r\namong the people--a want of an enlarged and enlightened understanding of\r\nthe principles of rational freedom--which led him to apprehend that their\r\nattempts at self-government would for a long season, at least, result in\r\nthe reign of faction and anarchy, rather than true republican principles.\r\nThe subsequent history of these countries--the divisions and contentions,\r\nthe revolutions and counter-revolutions, which have rent them asunder, and\r\ndeluged them in blood--clearly show that Mr. Adams but exercised a\r\nfar-seeing intelligence in entertaining these doubts. Nevertheless, as\r\nthey had succeeded in throwing off the Spanish yoke, and had, in fact,\r\nachieved their independence, Mr. Adams would not throw any impediment in\r\ntheir way. Trusting that his fears as to their ability for self-government\r\nmight be groundless, he gave his influence to the recognizing of their\r\nindependence by the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the Greek revolution broke out. The people of that classic land,\r\nafter enduring ages of the most brutal and humiliating oppression from the\r\nTurks, nobly resolved to break the chains of the Ottoman power, or perish\r\nin the attempt. The war was long, and sanguinary, but finally resulted in\r\nthe emancipation of Greece, and the establishment of its independence as a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States could not witness such a struggle\r\nwith indifference. A spirit of sympathy ran like electricity throughout\r\nthe land. Public meetings were held in nearly every populous town in the\r\nUnion, in which resolutions, encouraging the Greeks in their struggle,\r\nwere passed, and contributions taken up to aid them. Money, clothing,\r\nprovisions, arms, were collected in immense quantities and shipped to\r\nGreece. In churches, colleges, academies and schools--at the theatres,\r\nmuseums, and other places of amusement and public resort--aid was freely\r\nand generously given in behalf of the struggling patriots. Many citizens\r\nof the United States, when the first blast of the trumpet of liberty rang\r\nalong the Ionian seas, and through the Peloponnesus, sped across the\r\nocean, and, throwing themselves into the midst of the Grecian hosts,\r\ncontended heroically for their emancipation. Among these volunteers, was\r\nCol. J. P. Miller, of Vermont, who not only gallantly fought in the\r\nbattles of Greece, but was greatly serviceable in conveying supplies from\r\nthe United States to that struggling people.\r\n\r\nThe deep sympathy which prevailed in every section of the Union, was soon\r\nfelt in Congress. Many public men were anxious that the Government should\r\ntake some important and decisive step, even to hostilities, in behalf of\r\nGreece. Eloquent speeches were delivered in the House of Representatives\r\non the exciting topic. Mr. Clay electrified the country with his stirring\r\nappeals in behalf of the land in which was established the first republic\r\non earth. Mr. Webster submitted the following resolution to the House of\r\nRepresentatives:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That provision ought to be made by law, for defraying the\r\nexpense incident to the appointment of an Agent, or Commissioner, to\r\nGreece, whenever the President shall deem it expedient to make such\r\nappointment.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this resolution, Mr. Webster made a most eloquent speech, of\r\nwhich the following is the conclusion:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman--There are some things which, to be well done, must be\r\npromptly done. If we even determine to do the thing that is now proposed,\r\nwe may do it too late Sir, I am not of those who are for withholding aid\r\nwhen it is most urgently needed, and when the stress is past, and the aid\r\nno longer necessary, overwhelming the sufferers with caresses. I will not\r\nstand by and see my fellow-man drowning, without stretching out a hand to\r\nhelp him, till he has, by his own efforts and presence of mind, reached\r\nthe shore in safety, and then encumber him with aid. With suffering\r\nGreece, now is the crisis of her fate--her great, it may be her last\r\nstruggle. Sir, while we sit here deliberating, her destiny may be decided.\r\nThe Greeks, contending with ruthless oppressors, turn their eyes to us,\r\nand invoke us, by their ancestors, by their slaughtered wives and\r\nchildren, by their own blood poured out like water, by the hecatombs of\r\ndead they have heaped up, as it were, to heaven; they invoke, they implore\r\nfrom us some cheering sound, some look of sympathy, some token of\r\ncompassionate regard. They look to us as the great Republic of the\r\nearth--and they ask us, by our common faith, whether we can forget that\r\nthey are struggling, as we once struggled, for what we now so happily\r\nenjoy? I cannot say, sir, they will succeed; that rests with heaven. But,\r\nfor myself, sir, if I should to-morrow hear that they have failed--that\r\ntheir last phalanx had sunk beneath the Turkish cimetar, that the flames\r\nof their last city had sunk in its ashes, and that nought remained but\r\nthe wide, melancholy waste where Greece once was--I should still reflect,\r\nwith the most heartfelt satisfaction, that I have asked you, in the name\r\nof seven millions of freemen, that you would give them, at least, the\r\ncheering of one friendly voice.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee having in charge the raising of a fund for the assistance of\r\nthe Greeks, in New York, addressed a circular to the venerable\r\nex-President John Adams, to which they received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n                                               \"Quincy, Dec. 29, 1823.\r\n\"GENTLEMEN:--I have received your circular of the 12th inst., and I thank\r\nyou for the honor you have done me in addressing it to me. Be assured my\r\nheart beats in unison with yours, and with those of your constituents, and\r\nI presume with all the really civilized part of mankind, in sympathy with\r\nthe Greeks, suffering, as they are, in the great cause of liberty and\r\nhumanity. The gentlemen of Boston have taken measures to procure a general\r\nsubscription in their favor, through the State, and I shall contribute my\r\nmite with great pleasure. In the meantime I wish you, and all other\r\ngentlemen engaged in the virtuous work, all the success you or they can\r\nwish; for I believe no effort in favor of virtue will be ultimately lost.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your very humble Servant,\r\n                                                 \"JOHN ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of John Quincy Adams were ardently enlisted in behalf of\r\nthe Greek Revolution. But with a prudence and wisdom which characterized\r\nall his acts, he threw his influence against any direct interference on\r\nthe part of the Government of the United States. It would have been a\r\ndeparture from that neutral policy, in regard to European conflicts, on\r\nwhich the country had acted from the commencement of our national\r\nexistence, alike injurious and dangerous. He knew if we once entered into\r\nthese wars, on any pretext whatever, a door would be opened for foreign\r\nentanglements and endless conflicts, which would result in standing\r\narmies, immense national debts, and the long trail of evils of which they\r\nare the prolific source.\r\n\r\nWhen an application was made to Mr. Adams, as Secretary of State, through\r\nMr. Rush, our Minister at London, by an Agent of Greece, for aid from the\r\nUnited States, he was compelled, on principles above stated, to withhold\r\nthe required assistance. The correspondence which grew out of this\r\napplication is sufficiently interesting to find a place in these pages:--\r\n\r\n\"Andreas Luriottis, Envoy of the Provisional Government of Greece, to the\r\nHon. John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State to the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I feel no slight emotion, while, in behalf of Greece, my country,\r\nstruggling for independence and liberty, I address myself to the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n\"The independence for which we combat, you have achieved. The liberty to\r\nwhich we look, with anxious solicitude, you have obtained, and\r\nconsolidated in peace and in glory.\r\n\r\n\"Yet Greece, old Greece, the seat of early civilization and freedom,\r\nstretches out her hands, imploringly, to a land which sprung into being,\r\nas it were, ages after her own lustre had been extinguished! and\r\nventures to hope that the youngest and most vigorous sons of liberty, will\r\nregard, with no common sympathy, the efforts of the descendants of the\r\nheir and the elder born, whose precepts and whose example have\r\nserved--though insufficient, hitherto, for our complete regeneration--to\r\nregenerate half a world.\r\n\r\n\"I know, Sir, that the sympathies of the generous people of the United\r\nStates have been extensively directed towards us; and since I have reached\r\nthis country, an interview with their Minister, Mr. Rush, has served to\r\nconvince me more strongly, how great their claim is on our gratitude and\r\nour affection. May I hope that some means may be found to communicate\r\nthese our feelings, of which I am so proud to be the organ? We will still\r\nventure to rely on their friendship. We would look to their individual, if\r\nnot to their national, co-operation. Every, the slightest, assistance\r\nunder present circumstances, will aid the progress of the great work of\r\nliberty; and if, standing, as we have stood, alone and unsupported, with\r\neverything opposed to us, and nothing to encourage us but patriotism,\r\nenthusiasm, and sometimes even despair: if thus we have gone forward,\r\nliberating our provinces, one after another, and subduing every force\r\nwhich has been directed against us, what may we not do with the assistance\r\nfor which we venture to appeal to the generous and the free?\r\n\r\n\"Precipitated by circumstances into that struggle for independence, which,\r\never since the domination of our cruel and reckless tyrants, had never\r\nceased to be the object of our vows and prayers, we have, by the blessing\r\nof God, freed a considerable part of Greece from the ruthless invaders.\r\nThe Peloponnesus, Etolia, Carmania, Attica, Phocida, Boetia, and the\r\nIslands of the Archipelago and Candia, are nearly free. The armies and\r\nthe fleets which have been sent against us, have been subdued by the valor\r\nof our troops and our marine. Meanwhile we have organized a government,\r\nfounded upon popular suffrages: and you will probably have seen how\r\nclosely our organic law assimilates to that constitution under which your\r\nnation so happily and so securely lives.\r\n\r\n\"I have been sent hither by the government of Greece, to obtain assistance\r\nin our determined enterprize, on which we, like you, have staked our\r\nlives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor: and I believe my journey has\r\nnot been wholly without success. I should have been wanting to my duty had\r\nI not addressed you, supplicating the earliest display of your amiable\r\npurposes; entreating that diplomatic relations may be established between\r\nus; communicating the most earnest desire of my government that we may be\r\nallowed to call you allies as well as friends; and stating that we shall\r\nrejoice to enter upon discussions which may lead to immediate and\r\nadvantageous treaties, and to receive diplomatic agents without delay.\r\nBoth at Madrid and at Lisbon, I have been received with great kindness by\r\nthe American Representative, and am pleased to record the expression of my\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Though, fortunately, you are so far removed, and raised so much above the\r\nnarrow politics of Europe as to be little influenced by their\r\nvicissitudes, I venture to believe that Mr. Rush will explain to you the\r\nchanges which have taken place, and are still in action around us, in our\r\nfavor. And I conclude, rejoicing in the hope that North America and Greece\r\nmay be united in the bonds of long-enduring, and unbroken concord: and\r\nhave the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, your obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n                                                    \"AND. LURIOTTIS.\r\n  'London, February 20, 1823.\"\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS TO MR. RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                     \"Department of State,\r\n                                      Washington, 18th August, 1823.\r\n\"SIR:--I have the honor of inclosing, herewith, an answer to the letter\r\nfrom Mr. Luriottis, the Agent of the Greeks addressed to me, and a copy\r\nof which was transmitted with your dispatch No. 295.\r\n\r\n\"If, upon the receipt of this letter, Mr. Luriottis should still be in\r\nLondon, it will be desirable that you should deliver it to him in person,\r\naccompanied with such remarks and explanations as may satisfy him, and\r\nthose whom he represents, that, in declining the proposal of giving active\r\naid to the cause of Grecian emancipation, the Executive Government of the\r\nUnited States has been governed not by its inclinations, or a sentiment of\r\nindifference to the cause, but by its constitutional duties, clear and\r\nunequivocal.\r\n\r\n\"The United States could give assistance to the Greeks, only by the\r\napplication of some portion of their public forces or of their public\r\nrevenue in their favor, which would constitute them in a state of war with\r\nthe Ottoman Porte, and perhaps with all the Barbary powers. To make this\r\ndisposal either of force or of treasure, you are aware is, by our\r\nconstitution, not within the competency of the Executive. It could be\r\ndetermined only by an act of Congress, which would assuredly not be\r\nadopted, should it even be recommended by the Executive.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of the United States, with reference to foreign nations, has\r\nalways been founded upon the moral principle of natural law--Peace with\r\nall mankind. From whatever cause war between other nations, whether\r\nforeign or domestic, has arisen, the unvarying law of the United States\r\nhas been peace with both belligerents. From the first war of the French\r\nRevolution, to the recent invasion of Spain, there has been a succession\r\nof wars, national and civil, in almost everyone of which one of the\r\nparties was contending for liberty or independence. In the first French\r\nrevolutionary war, a strong impulse of feeling urged the people of the\r\nUnited States to take side with the party which, at its commencement, was\r\ncontending, apparently, at least, for both. Had the policy of the United\r\nStates not been essentially pacific, a stronger case to claim their\r\ninterference could scarcely have been presented. They nevertheless\r\ndeclared themselves neutral, and the principle, then deliberately settled,\r\nhas been invariably adhered to ever since.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the recognition of sovereign States, and the establishment\r\nwith them of a diplomatic intercourse, the experience of the last thirty\r\nyears has served also to ascertain the limits proper for the application\r\nof principles in which every nation must exercise some latitude of\r\ndiscretion. Precluded by their neutral position from interfering in the\r\nquestion of right, the United States have recognized the fact of foreign\r\nsovereignty only when it was undisputed, or disputed without any rational\r\nprospect of success. In this manner the successive changes of government\r\nin many of the European states, and the revolutionary governments of South\r\nAmerica, have been acknowledged. The condition of the Greeks is not yet\r\nsuch as will admit of their recognition, upon these principles.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, as we cherish the most friendly feelings towards them, and are\r\nsincerely disposed to render them any service which may be compatible with\r\nour neutrality, it will give us pleasure to learn, from time to time, the\r\nactual state of their cause, political and military. Should Mr. Luriottis\r\nbe enabled and disposed to furnish this information, it may always be\r\ncommunicated through you, and will be received with satisfaction here. The\r\npublic accounts from that quarter have been of late very scanty, and we\r\nshall be glad to obtain any authentic particulars, which may come to your\r\nknowledge from this, or through any other channel.\r\n\r\n\"I am with great respect, Sir, your very humble and obedient servant,\r\n                                                   JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS TO MR. LURIOTTIS.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Department of State,\r\n                                     Washington, 18th August, 1823.\r\n\"Sir: A copy of the letter which you did me the honor of addressing to me,\r\non the 20th of February last, has been transmitted to me by the Minister\r\nof the United States at London, and has received the deliberate\r\nconsideration of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The sentiments with which he has witnessed the struggles of your\r\ncountrymen for their national emancipation and independence, had been made\r\nmanifest to the world in a public message to the Congress of the United\r\nStates. They are cordially felt by the people of this Union; who,\r\nsympathizing with the cause of freedom and independence wherever its\r\nstandard is unfurled, behold with peculiar interest the display of Grecian\r\nenergy in defence of Grecian liberties, and the association of heroic\r\nexertions, at the present time, with the proudest glories of former ages,\r\nin the land of Epaminondas and Philopoemon.\r\n\r\n\"But while cheering with their best wishes the cause of the Greeks, the\r\nUnited States are forbidden, by the duties of their situation, from taking\r\npart in the war, to which their relation is that of neutrality. At peace\r\nthemselves with all the world, their established policy, and the\r\nobligations of the laws of nations, preclude them from becoming voluntary\r\nauxiliaries to a cause which would involve them in war.\r\n\r\n\"If in the progress of events the Greeks should be enabled to establish\r\nand organize themselves as an independent nation, the United States will\r\nbe among the first to welcome them, in that capacity, into the general\r\nfamily; to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with them, suited\r\nto the mutual interests of the two countries; and to recognize, with\r\nspecial satisfaction, their constituted state in the character of a sister\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, with distinguished consideration, Sir, your very\r\nhumble and obedient servant,\r\n                                                   \"JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiments, in regard to the foreign policy of our Government, which\r\nMr. Adams embodies in this correspondence, he had previously expressed in\r\nan oration delivered in the city of Washington, on the 4th of July, 1821,\r\nof which the following is an extract:--\r\n\r\n\"America, in the assembly of nations, since her admission among them, has\r\ninvariably, though often fruitlessly, held forth to them the hand of\r\nhonest friendship, of equal freedom, of generous reciprocity; she has\r\nuniformly spoken among them, though often to heedless, and often to\r\ndisdainful ears, the language of equal liberty, of equal justice, and\r\nequal rights; she has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a\r\nsingle exception, respected the independence of other nations while\r\nasserting and maintaining her own; she has abstained from interference in\r\nthe concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to\r\nwhich she clings as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She has\r\nseen that probably for centuries to come all the contests of that\r\nAceldama, the European world, will be contests of inveterate power and\r\nemerging right. Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been\r\nor shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions, and her\r\nprayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She\r\nis the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all--she is the\r\nchampion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general\r\ncause, by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her\r\nexample:--she well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than\r\nher own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would\r\ninvolve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of\r\ninterest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which\r\nassume the colors, and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental\r\nmaxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force; the\r\nfrontlet on her brow would no longer beam with the ineffable splendor of\r\nfreedom and independence; but in its stead would soon be substituted an\r\nimperial diadem, flashing in false and tarnished lustre, the murky\r\nradiance of dominion and power. She might become the dictatress of the\r\nworld: she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Adams's occupancy of the state department, efforts were made by\r\nthe American Government to abolish the African slave trade, and procure\r\nits denunciation as piracy, by the civilized world. On the 28th of Feb.,\r\n1823, the following resolution was adopted by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, at Washington, by a vote of 131 to 9:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to enter\r\nupon and to prosecute, from time to time, such negotiations with the\r\nseveral maratime powers of Europe and America, as he may deem expedient\r\nfor the effectual abolition of the African slave trade, and its ultimate\r\ndenunciation as piracy, under the law of nations, by the consent of the\r\ncivilized world.\"\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this resolution, Mr. Adams, as Secretary of State,\r\nissued directions to the American Ministers in Spain, Russia, the\r\nNetherlands, Colombia, and Buenos Ayres, to enter into negotiations with\r\nthe Governments of these countries on this subject. Mr. Adams also\r\nmaintained an able correspondence with the Hon. Stratford Canning, the\r\nBritish Minister at Washington, in relation to the basis on which a treaty\r\nshould be formed with Great Britain for the suppression of the foreign\r\nslave trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush, the American Minister at the Court of St. James, was directed to\r\nenter upon negotiations in London, to this end. His instructions were\r\nwritten by Mr. Adams, with his usual sound judgment and enlarged views of\r\nnational policy, and the claims of humanity. The convention was in due\r\ntime completed, and signed by the Plenipotentiaries of both nations, on\r\nthe 13th of March. 1824, and was sent by Mr. Rush to Washington for\r\nratification. Mr. Monroe and Mr. Adams were ready to give it their\r\nsanction; but the Senate insisted on striking out a provision in the first\r\narticle. The article commenced as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The commanders and commissioned officers of each of the two high\r\ncontracting parties, duly authorized, under the regulations and\r\ninstructions of their respective Governments, to cruise on the coasts of\r\nAfrica, of America, and of the West Indies, for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade, shall be empowered, under the conditions, limitations, and\r\nrestrictions hereinafter specified,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe Senate struck out the words \"of America.\" This amendment the British\r\nGovernment would not assent to. Thus the negotiation on the slave trade,\r\nso near a consummation, fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe's administration closed on the 3rd of March, 1825. It was a\r\nperiod of uninterrupted prosperity to the country. Our foreign commerce,\r\nrecovering from the paralysis caused by the embargo, the non-intercourse\r\nact, and the war, spread forth its wings and whitened every sea and ocean\r\non the globe. The domestic condition of the Union was thriving beyond the\r\nprecedent of many former years. Improvements in agriculture were\r\ndeveloped; domestic manufactures received a fair protection and\r\nencouragement; internal improvements, gaining more and more the attention\r\nand confidence of the people, had been prosecuted to the evident benefit\r\nof all branches of business and enterprize.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the administration of Mr. Monroe is worthy of\r\nnote. So judiciously and patriotically had he exercised the powers\r\nentrusted to him, that he disarmed opposition. Divisions, jealousies and\r\ncontentions were destroyed, and a thorough fusion of all political parties\r\ntook place. At his re-election for the second term of the presidency,\r\nthere was no opposing candidate. There was but one party, and that was the\r\ngreat party of the American people. His election was unanimous.\r\n\r\nIn all these measures, Mr. Adams was the coadjutor and confidential\r\nadviser of Mr. Monroe. It is no derogation from the well-merited\r\nreputation of the latter to say, that many of the most striking and\r\npraiseworthy features of his administration were enstamped upon it by the\r\nlabor and influence of the former. His success in maturing and carrying\r\ninto execution his most popular measures must be attributed, in no small\r\nextent, to the ability and faithfulness of his eminent Secretary of State.\r\nAnd the historian may truly record that to John Quincy Adams, in an\r\neminent degree, belongs a portion of the honor and credit which have been\r\nso generally accorded to the administration of James Monroe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' NOMINATION TO THE PRESIDENCY--SPIRITED PRESIDENTIAL\r\nCAMPAIGN--NO CHOICE BY THE PEOPLE--ELECTION GOES TO THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES--MR. ADAMS ELECTED PRESIDENT--HIS INAUGURATION--\r\nFORMS HIS CABINET.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe was the last of the illustrious line of Presidents whose\r\nclaims to that eminent station dated back to the revolution. A grateful\r\npeople had conferred the highest honors in their gift upon the most\r\nconspicuous of those patriots who had faithfully served them in that\r\nperilous struggle, and aided in constructing and consolidating the union\r\nof these States. This debt punctually and honorably discharged, they\r\nlooked to another generation, possessing claims of a different\r\ndescription, for servants to elevate to the dignity of the presidential\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a large class of public men who had in the mean time\r\nbecome conspicuous for talents and services of various descriptions, it is\r\nno matter of surprise that the people of the United States should\r\nentertain a diversity of opinions in regard to the most suitable\r\nindividual to fill a station which had hitherto been occupied by men whose\r\nvirtues and whose patriotism had shed the brightest lustre on the\r\nAmerican name and character throughout the world. Candidates for the\r\npresidency were nominated in various sections of the Union. The eastern\r\nStates turned their eyes instinctively towards JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, as one,\r\namong all the eminent competitors, the most fitted, by character and\r\nservices, for the office of President of the United States. The members of\r\nthe Legislature of Maine resolved--\r\n\r\n\"That the splendid talents and incorruptible integrity of JOHN QUINCY\r\nADAMS, his republican habits and principles, distinguished public\r\nservices, and extensive knowledge of, and devoted attachment to, the vital\r\ninterests of the country, justly entitle him to the first honors in the\r\ngift of an enlightened and grateful people.\"\r\n\r\nThe republican members of the Massachusetts Legislature adopted the\r\nfollowing resolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the ability, experience, integrity and patriotism of JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS; his manly efforts to defend the principles of that\r\ngovernment under which, in God's providence, we hope to die; his unshaken\r\nfortitude and resolution in all political exigencies; his long, faithful,\r\nand valuable services, under the patronage of all the Presidents of the\r\nUnited States, present him to the people of this nation, as a man\r\neminently qualified to subserve the best interests of his country, and as\r\na statesman without reproach.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a man who has given such continued and indubitable pledges\r\nof his patriotism and capacity, may be safely placed at the head of this\r\nnation. Every impulse of his heart, and every dictate of his mind, must\r\nunite promptly in the support of the interests, the honor, and the liberty\r\nof his country.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That JOHN QUINCY ADAMS is hereby recommended by us to the\r\npeople of the United States, as the most suitable candidate for the office\r\nof President, at the approaching election.\"\r\n\r\nA meeting of the citizens of Rhode Island passed the following among other\r\nresolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, although we duly acknowledge the talents and public\r\nservices of all the candidates for the presidency, we have the fullest\r\nconfidence in the acknowledged ability, integrity and experience of JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS, the accomplished scholar, the true republican, the\r\nenlightened statesman, and the honest man; and we are desirous that his\r\nmerits should be rewarded with the first office in the gift of the people\r\nof the United States--that his future services may continue unto us those\r\nblessings which, under the present administration of the General\r\nGovernment, we have so abundantly enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nThese were high encomiums. But who among the American people, now that the\r\npatriot has departed from earth, can survey his life, his character, and\r\nhis services, and not acknowledge they were justly and richly deserved?\r\nSimilar resolutions were passed in all the eastern and many of the\r\nnorthern States.\r\n\r\nThe west brought forward HENRY CLAY, one of the most popular orators and\r\neminent statesman of the day. GEN. JACKSON, who had earned a splendid\r\nmilitary reputation, was nominated in the southwest, and WM. H. CRAWFORD\r\nwas selected as the candidate representing the southern portion of the\r\nconfederacy. These were all men of eminence and of acknowledged talents.\r\nThey were worthy competitors for the highest honors of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Mr. Adams rested his claims for the presidency on no\r\nfactitious qualities. They urged that his characteristics were such as to\r\ncommend him to the confidence of every true republican and well-wisher of\r\nhis country. While his attainments were not of the showy and popular cast\r\npossessed by many public men, they yet were of that solid, practical and\r\nvaluable description which must ever receive the sanction of intelligent\r\nand reflecting minds.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications on which his supporters depended, and to which they\r\ncalled the attention of the American people, as reasons for elevating him\r\nto the head of the General Government, may be summarily enumerated as\r\nfollows:--1. The purity of his private character--the simplicity of his\r\npersonal habits--his unbending integrity and uprightness, even beyond\r\nsuspicion. 2. His commanding talents, and his acquirements both as a\r\nscholar and a statesman. 3. His love of country--his truly American\r\nfeelings, in all that concerned the welfare and honor of the United\r\nStates. 4. His long experience in public affairs, especially his\r\nfamiliarity with our foreign relations, and his perfect knowledge of the\r\ninstitutions, the internal condition and policy of European nations. 5.\r\nHis advocacy of protection to domestic manufactures, and of a judicious\r\nsystem of internal improvements.\r\n\r\nIn regard to internal improvements by the General Government, there was a\r\ndifference of opinion between Mr. Adams and President Monroe. The latter\r\nwas strongly impressed with the beneficial tendency of a well-digested\r\nsystem of internal improvements; but he believed the constitution\r\nconferred no power on Congress to make appropriations for such a purpose.\r\nIt was in this view of the subject that he vetoed a bill which assumed the\r\nright to adopt and execute such a system, passed by Congress during the\r\nsession of 1820-21. But anxious that internal improvements, confined to\r\ngreat national purposes, and with proper limitations, should be\r\nprosecuted, he suggested that an amendment of the constitution to that\r\neffect should be recommended to the several States.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, however, had no doubts that Congress already possessed a\r\nconstitutional power to prosecute such internal improvements as were of a\r\nnational character, and calculated to benefit the Union, and to levy\r\nduties for the protection of domestic manufactures. During his entire\r\npolitical career he had deemed these to be two great points toward which\r\nthe American Government and people should turn their especial attention;\r\nand he ever gave them his faithful advocacy and support. With consummate\r\nwisdom, he foresaw that the more completely our internal resources were\r\ndeveloped, and the less dependent we were on foreign powers, the greater\r\nwould be our public and private prosperity. He insisted that by an\r\nadequate protection of domestic manufactures, there would be an increased\r\ndemand for our raw materials at home, and thus the several productive and\r\nmanufacturing sections of the Republic would realize the benefits of a\r\ndependence on each other, and the Union would be consolidated and\r\nperpetuated for ages to come.\r\n\r\nWhile a candidate for the presidency, Mr. Adams received a letter\r\ninquiring his views on the subject of internal improvement. The following\r\nis an extract from his reply:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 23rd of Feb., 1807, I offered, in the Senate of the United States,\r\nof which I was then a member, the first resolution, as I believe, that\r\never was presented to Congress, contemplating a general system of internal\r\nimprovement. I thought that Congress possessed the power of appropriating\r\nmoney to such improvement, and of authorizing the works necessary for\r\nmaking it--subject always to the territorial rights of the several States\r\nin or through which the improvement is to be made, to be secured by the\r\nconsent of their Legislatures, and to proprietary rights of individuals,\r\nto be purchased or indemnified. I still hold the same opinions; and,\r\nalthough highly respecting the purity of intention of those who object, on\r\nconstitutional grounds, to the exercise of this power, it is with\r\nheartfelt satisfaction that I perceive those objections gradually yielding\r\nto the paramount influence of the general welfare. Already have\r\nappropriations of money to great objects of internal improvement been\r\nfreely made; and I hope we shall both live to see the day, when the only\r\nquestion of our statesmen and patriots, concerning the authority of\r\nCongress to improve, by public works essentially beneficent, and beyond\r\nthe means of less than national resources, the condition of our common\r\ncountry, will be how it ever could have been doubted.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Mr. Adams expressed himself on the subject of\r\ninternal improvements in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"The question of the power of Congress to authorize the making of internal\r\nimprovements, is, in other words, a question whether the people of this\r\nUnion, in forming their common social compact, as avowedly for the purpose\r\nof promoting their general welfare, have performed their work in a manner\r\nso ineffably stupid as to deny themselves the means of bettering their own\r\ncondition. I have too much respect for the intellect of my country to\r\nbelieve it. The first object of human association is the improvement of\r\nthe condition of the associated. Roads and canals are among the most\r\nessential means of improving the condition of nations. And a people which\r\nshould deliberately, by the organization of its authorized power, deprive\r\nitself of the faculty of multiplying its own blessings, would be as wise\r\nas a creator who should undertake to constitute a human being without a\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to other claims, the friends of Mr. Adams urged his elevation\r\nto the presidency on the ground of locality. During the thirty-six years\r\nwhich had passed since the adoption of the constitution, the General\r\nGovernment had been administered but four years by a northern President.\r\nIt was insisted with much force that the southern portion of the Republic\r\nhad thus far exerted a disproportionate influence in the executive\r\ndepartment of the nation. While the north, although far the most populous,\r\nand contributing much the largest portion of the means for defraying the\r\nnational expenditures, would not claim to monopolize an undue degree of\r\npower in controlling the measures of administration, yet it could justly\r\ninsist that its demands for an equitable share of influence should be\r\nheeded. These suggestions unquestionably possessed a weight in the minds\r\nof the people, favorable to the prospects of Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign of 1824, was more spirited and exciting than any\r\nthat had taken place since the first election of Mr. Jefferson. It was\r\nnovel in the number of candidates presented for the suffrages of the\r\npeople, and was conducted with great zeal and vigor by the friends of the\r\ndifferent aspirants. Strictly speaking, it could not be called a party\r\ncontest. Mr. Monroe's wise and prudent administration had obliterated\r\nparty lines, and left a very general unanimity of sentiment on political\r\nprinciples and measures, throughout the Union. The various candidates--\r\nAdams, Jackson, Clay, Crawford--all subscribed, substantially, to the same\r\npolitical creed, and entertained similar views as to the principles on\r\nwhich the General Government should be administered. The struggle was a\r\npersonal and sectional one, more than of a party nature.\r\n\r\nIt had long been foreseen that a choice of President would not be effected\r\nby the people. The result verified this prediction. Of two hundred and\r\nsixty-one electoral votes, Gen. Jackson received ninety-nine, Mr. Adams\r\neighty-four, Mr. Crawford forty-one, and Mr. Clay thirty-seven. Neither of\r\nthe candidates having received a majority in the electoral colleges, the\r\nelection devolved on the House of Representatives. This took place on the\r\n9th of Feb., 1825.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of that day, the House met at an earlier hour than usual.\r\nThe galleries, the lobbies, and the adjacent apartments, were filled to\r\noverflowing--with spectators from every part of the Union to witness the\r\nmomentous event. It was a scene the most sublime that could be witnessed\r\non earth. The Representatives of the People, in the exercise of the\r\nhighest right of freemen, were about to select a citizen to administer the\r\nGovernment of a great Republic.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the House were present, with the exception of one, who\r\nwas confined by indisposition. The Speaker (Henry Clay) took his chair,\r\nand the ordinary business of the morning was attended to in the usual\r\nmanner. At 12 o'clock, precisely, the members of the Senate entered the\r\nhall, preceded by their Sergeant-at-arms, and having the President of the\r\nSenate at their head, who was invited to a seat on the right hand of the\r\nSpeaker. The Senators were assigned seats in front of the Speaker's chair.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate (Mr. Gaillard) then rose, and stated that the\r\ncertificates forwarded by the electors from each State would be delivered\r\nto the Tellers. Mr. Tazewell of the Senate, and Messrs. John W. Taylor\r\nand Philip P. Barbour on the part of the House, took their places, as\r\nTellers, at the Clerk's table. The President of the Senate then opened two\r\npackets, one received by messenger and the other by mail, containing the\r\ncertificates of the votes of the State of New Hampshire. One of these\r\ncertificates was then read by Mr. Tazewell, while the other was compared\r\nwith it by Messrs. Taylor and Barbour. The whole having been read, and\r\nthe votes of New Hampshire declared, they were set down by the Clerks of\r\nthe Senate and of the House of Representatives, seated at different\r\ntables. Thus the certificates from all the States were gone through with.\r\nAt the conclusion, the Tellers left the Clerk's tables, and, presenting\r\nthemselves in front of the Speaker, Mr. Tazewell delivered their report\r\nof the votes given.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate then rose, and declared that no person had\r\nreceived a majority of the votes given for President of the United States:\r\nthat Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford, were the\r\nthree persons who had received the highest number of votes; and that the\r\nremaining duties in the choice of a President now devolved on the House of\r\nRepresentatives. He further declared, that John C. Calhoun of South\r\nCarolina, having received 182 votes, was duly elected Vice President of\r\nthe United States, to serve four years from the 4th of March next. The\r\nmembers of the Senate then retired.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker directed the roll of the House to be called by States, and the\r\nmembers of the respective delegations to take their seats in the order in\r\nwhich the States should be called, beginning at the right hand of the\r\nSpeaker. The delegations took their seats accordingly. Ballot-boxes were\r\ndistributed to each delegation, by the Sergeant-at-arms, and the Speaker\r\ndirected that the balloting should, proceed. The ballots having all been\r\ndeposited in the boxes, Tellers were named by the respective delegations,\r\nbeing one from each State, who took their seats at two tables.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster of Massachusetts was appointed by those Tellers who sat at one\r\ntable, and Mr. Randolph of Virginia by those at the other, to announce the\r\nresult. After the ballots were counted out, Mr. Webster rose, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker: The Tellers of the votes at this table have proceeded to\r\ncount the ballots contained in the boxes set before them. The result they\r\nfind to be, that there are for John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts,\r\nthirteen votes; for Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, seven votes; for William\r\nH. Crawford, of Georgia, four votes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, from the other table, made a statement corresponding with\r\nthat of Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker then stated this result to the House, and announced that JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS, having a majority of the votes of these United States, was\r\nduly elected President of the same, for four years, commencing on the 4th\r\nday of March, 1825.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed to wait upon Mr. Adams, and announce to him the\r\nresult of the election, of which Mr. Webster was chairman. On performing\r\nthis duty, they received from Mr. Adams the following reply:--\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--In receiving this testimonial from the Representatives of the\r\nPeople and States of this Union, I am deeply sensible of the circumstances\r\nunder which it has been given. All my predecessors have been honored with\r\nmajorities of the electoral voices, in the primary colleges. It has been\r\nmy fortune to be placed, by the divisions of sentiment prevailing among\r\nour countrymen on this occasion, in competition, friendly and honorable,\r\nwith three of my fellow-citizens, all justly enjoying, in eminent degrees,\r\nthe public favor; and of whose worth, talents and services no one\r\nentertains a higher and more respectful sense than myself. The names of\r\ntwo of them were, in the fulfilment of the provisions of the\r\nconstitution, presented to the selection of the House of Representatives\r\nin concurrence with my own,--names closely associated with the glory of\r\nthe nation, and one of them farther recommended by a larger majority of\r\nthe primary electoral suffrages than mine.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, could my refusal to accept the trust thus\r\ndelegated to me give an opportunity to the people to form, and to express,\r\nwith a nearer approach to unanimity, the object of their preference, I\r\nshould not hesitate to decline the acceptance of this eminent charge, and\r\nto submit the decision of this momentous question again to their\r\ndetermination. But the constitution itself has not so disposed of the\r\ncontingency which would arise in the event of my refusal. I shall,\r\ntherefore, repair to the post assigned me by the call of my country,\r\nsignified through her constitutional organs; oppressed with the magnitude\r\nof the task before me, but cheered with the hope of that generous support\r\nfrom my fellow-citizens, which, in the vicissitudes of a life devoted to\r\ntheir service, has never failed to sustain me--confident in the trust,\r\nthat the wisdom of the legislative councils will guide and direct me in\r\nthe path of my official duty; and relying, above all, upon the\r\nsuperintending providence of that Being \"in whose hands our breath is, and\r\nwhose are all our ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I pray you to make acceptable to the House, the assurance of\r\nmy profound gratitude for their confidence, and to accept yourselves my\r\nthanks for the friendly terms in which you have communicated to me their\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nThe diffidence manifested by Mr. Adams in accepting the office of\r\nPresident, under the peculiar circumstances of his election, and his wish,\r\nif it were possible, to submit his claims again to the people, were\r\nunquestionably uttered with great sincerity of heart. He was the choice of\r\nbut a minority, as expressed in the electoral vote; and in accordance with\r\nhis republican principles and feelings, he would have preferred another\r\nexpression of public opinion.  But the constitution made no provision for\r\nsuch an arbitrament. He must either serve or resign. In the latter case,\r\nthe Vice President would have discharged the duties of President during\r\nthe term. Mr. Adams had no alternative, therefore, but to accept the\r\noffice, agreeably to the terms of the constitution. Had either of his\r\ncompetitors been elected by the House of Representatives, they would have\r\nbeen, as he was, a minority President. Notwithstanding Gen. Jackson\r\nreceived fifteen more electoral votes than Mr. Adams, yet it is believed\r\nthat in the primary assemblies the latter obtained a greater number of the\r\nactual votes of the people than the former.\r\n\r\n\"Although Gen. Jackson had a plurality in the nominal returns from the\r\nelectoral colleges, the question is, whether he had a plurality in the\r\npopular votes of the States. In North Carolina, the Crawford men had a\r\ngreat plurality over either of the Jackson and Adams sections; but the two\r\nlatter joining their forces, gave the electoral vote of the State, it\r\nbeing fifteen, to Gen. Jackson. Deduct this from Gen. Jackson's\r\nplurality--as it should be, if the principle of plurality is to\r\ngovern--and it leaves him eighty-four, the same as the vote of Mr. Adams.\r\nBut Mr. Adams had a great plurality of the popular vote of New York, and\r\non this principle should be credited the entire thirty-six votes of that\r\nState, whereas, he received only twenty-six. This adjustment would carry\r\nMr. Adams up to ninety-four, and leave Gen. Jackson with eighty-four.\r\nBesides, the popular majorities for Mr. Adams in the six New England\r\nStates were greatly in excess of the Jackson majorities in the eight\r\nStates which gave their vote for him; which largely augments Mr. Adams'\r\naggregate plurality in the Union over Gen. Jackson's. Then deduct the\r\nconstitutional allowance for the slave vote in the slave States, as given\r\nby their masters. It will not be pretended that this is a popular vote,\r\nthough constitutional. Gen. Jackson obtained fifty-five electoral votes,\r\nmore than half his entire vote, and Mr. Adams only six from slave States.\r\nIt will therefore be seen, that on the principle of a popular plurality,\r\ncarried out, and carried through, (it ought not to stop for the advantage\r\nof one party,) Mr. Adams, in the election of 1824, was FAR AHEAD of Gen.\r\nJackson.\" [Footnote: Colton's Life and Times of Henry Clay.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1825, John Quincy Adams was inaugurated as President\r\nof the United States, and took the executive chair, which had been entered\r\ntwenty-eight years before by his venerated father. The declaration of that\r\nfather in reference to the son, when a lad--\"He behaves like a man!\"--had\r\ngathered strength and meaning in the lapse of years. The people of the\r\nAmerican republic, taught by a long series of faithful and eminent\r\nservices, in the fulfilment of the prophetic words, placed him in a\r\nposition the most elevated and honorable, the most worthy the aim of a\r\npure and patriotic ambition, that earth can afford!\r\n\r\nThe scene at the inauguration was splendid and imposing. At an early hour\r\nof the day the avenues leading to the capitol presented an animated\r\nspectacle. Crowds of citizens on foot, in carriages, and on horseback,\r\nwere hastening to the great centre of attraction. Strains of martial\r\nmusic, and the movements of the various military corps, heightened the\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nAt 12 o'clock, the military escort, consisting of general and staff\r\nofficers, and several volunteer companies, received the President elect at\r\nhis residence, together with President Monroe, and several officers of\r\ngovernment. The procession, led by the cavalry, and accompanied by an\r\nimmense concourse of citizens, proceeded to the capitol, where it was\r\nreceived, with military honors, by the U. S. Marine Corps under Col.\r\nHenderson.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hall of the House of Representatives presented a brilliant\r\nspectacle. The galleries and the lobbies were crowded with spectators. The\r\nsofas between the columns, the bar, the promenade in the rear of the\r\nSpeaker's chair, and the three outer rows of the members' seats, were\r\noccupied by a splendid array of beauty and fashion. On the left, the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, in the costume of their respective Courts, occupied the\r\nplace assigned them, immediately before the steps which lead to the chair.\r\nThe officers of the army and navy were scattered in groups throughout the\r\nhall. In front of the Clerk's table chairs were placed for the Judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past 12 o'clock, the marshals, in blue scarfs, made\r\ntheir appearance in the hall, at the head of the august procession. First\r\ncame the officers of both Houses of Congress. Then appeared the President\r\nelect, followed by the venerable ex-president Monroe, with his family. To\r\nthese succeeded the Judges of the Supreme Court, in their robes of office,\r\nthe members of the Senate, preceded by the Vice-President, with a number\r\nof the members of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, in a plain suit of black, made entirely of American\r\nmanufactures, ascended to the Speaker's chair, and took his seat. The\r\nChief Justice was placed in front of the Clerk's table, having before him\r\nanother table on the floor of the hall, on the opposite side of which sat\r\nthe remaining Judges, with their faces towards the chair. The doors having\r\nbeen closed, and silence proclaimed, Mr. Adams arose, and, in a distinct\r\nand firm tone of voice, read his inaugural address.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the address, a general plaudit burst forth from the\r\nvast assemblage, which continued some minutes. Mr. Adams then descended\r\nfrom the chair, and, proceeding to the Judges' table, received from the\r\nChief Justice a volume of the Laws of the United States, from which he\r\nread, with a loud voice, the oath of office. The plaudits and cheers of\r\nthe multitude were at this juncture repeated, accompanied by salutes of\r\nartillery from without.\r\n\r\nThe congratulations which then poured in from every side occupied the\r\nhands, and could not but reach the heart, of President Adams. The meeting\r\nbetween him and his venerated predecessor, had in it something peculiarly\r\naffecting. General Jackson was among the earliest of those who took the\r\nhand of the President; and their looks and deportment towards each other\r\nwere a rebuke to that littleness of party spirit which can see no merit\r\nin a rival, and feel no joy in the honor of a competitor.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1 o'clock, the procession commenced leaving the hall. The\r\nPresident was escorted back as he came. On his arrival at his residence,\r\nhe received the compliments and respects of a great number of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, who called on him to tender their congratulations. The\r\nproceedings of the day were closed by an \"inaugural ball\" in the evening.\r\nAmong the guests present, were the President and Vice-President.\r\nEx-President Monroe, a number of foreign ministers, with many civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval officers.[Footnote: National Intelligencer.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's Inaugural Address is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our federal\r\nconstitution, and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the\r\ncareer upon which I am about to enter, I appear, my fellow-citizens, in\r\nyour presence, and in that of heaven, to bind myself, by the solemnities\r\nof a religious obligation, to the faithful performance of the duties\r\nallotted to me, in the station to which I have been called.\r\n\r\n\"In unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall be\r\ngoverned, in the fulfilment of those duties, my first resort will be to\r\nthat constitution which I shall swear, to the best of my ability, to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend. That revered instrument enumerates the\r\npowers and prescribes the duties of the Executive Magistrate, and in its\r\nfirst words, declares the purposes to which these, and the whole action of\r\nthe Government instituted by it, should be invariably and sacredly\r\ndevoted--to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this Union,\r\nin their successive generations. Since the adoption of this social\r\ncompact, one of these generations has passed away. It is the work of our\r\nforefathers. Administered by some of the most eminent men, who contributed\r\nto its formation, through a most eventful period in the annals of the\r\nworld, and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war, incidental to\r\nthe condition of associated man, it has not disappointed the hopes and\r\naspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation. It\r\nhas promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all; it\r\nhas, to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity, secured the\r\nfreedom and happiness of this people. We now receive it as a precious\r\ninheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its establishment,\r\ndoubly bound by the examples which they have left us, and by the blessings\r\nwhich we have enjoyed, as the fruits of their labors, to transmit the\r\nsame, unimpaired, to the succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n\"In the compass of thirty-six years, since this great national covenant\r\nwas instituted, a body of laws enacted under its authority, and in\r\nconformity with its provisions, has unfolded its powers, and carried into\r\npractical operation its effective energies. Subordinate departments have\r\ndistributed the executive functions in their various relations to foreign\r\naffairs, to the revenue and expenditures, and to the military force of the\r\nUnion, by land and sea. A co-ordinate department of the judiciary has\r\nexpounded the constitution and the laws; settling, in harmonious\r\ncoincidence with the legislative will, numerous weighty questions of\r\nconstruction, which the imperfection of human language had rendered\r\nunavoidable. The year of jubilee since the first formation of our Union,\r\nhas just elapsed; that of the Declaration of our Independence is at hand.\r\nThe consummation of both was effected by this constitution. Since that\r\nperiod, a population of four millions has multiplied to twelve. A\r\nterritory bounded by the Mississippi has been extended from sea to sea.\r\nNew States have been admitted to the Union, in numbers nearly equal to\r\nthose of the first confederation. Treaties of pence, amity, and commerce,\r\nhave been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth. The people\r\nof other nations, inhabitants of regions acquired, not by conquests, but\r\nby compact, have been united with us in the participation of our rights\r\nand duties, of our burdens and blessings. The forest has fallen by the axe\r\nof our woodsmen--the soil has been made to teem by the tillage of our\r\nfarmers; our commerce has whitened every ocean. The dominion of man over\r\nphysical nature has been extended by the invention of our artists. Liberty\r\nand law have marched hand in hand. All the purposes of human association\r\nhave been accomplished as effectually as under any other Government on\r\nthe globe, and at a cost little exceeding, in a whole generation, the\r\nexpenditures of other nations in a single year.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution\r\nfounded upon the republican principle of equal rights. To admit that this\r\npicture has its shades, is but to say, that it is still the condition of\r\nmen upon earth. From evil--physical, moral, and political--it is not our\r\nclaim to be exempt. We have suffered, sometimes by the visitation of\r\nHeaven through disease, often by the wrongs and injustice of other\r\nnations, even to the extremities of war; and lastly, by dissentions among\r\nourselves--dissentions, perhaps, inseparable from the enjoyment of\r\nfreedom, but which have more than once appeared to threaten the\r\ndissolution of the Union, and, with it, the overthrow of all the\r\nenjoyments of our present lot, and all our earthly hopes of the future.\r\nThe causes of these dissensions have been various, founded upon\r\ndifferences of speculation in the theory of republican government, upon\r\nconflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations; upon\r\njealousies of partial and sectional interests, aggravated by prejudices\r\nand prepossessions, which strangers to each other are ever apt to\r\nentertain.\r\n\r\n\"It is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me, to observe\r\nthat the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights,\r\nhas, at the close of that generation by which it was formed, been crowned\r\nwith success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders.\r\nUnion, justice, tranquillity, the common defence, the general welfare,\r\nand the blessings of liberty--all have been promoted by the Government\r\nunder which we have lived. Standing at this point of time, looking back to\r\nthat generation which has gone by, and forward to that which is advancing,\r\nwe may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering hope. From\r\nthe experience of the past, we derive instructive lessons for the future.\r\n\r\n\"Of the two great political parties which have divided the opinions and\r\nfeelings of our country, the candid and the just will now admit, that both\r\nhave contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity, ardent patriotism,\r\nand disinterested sacrifices, to the formation and administration of the\r\nGovernment, and that both have required a liberal indulgence for a portion\r\nof human infirmity and error. The revolutionary wars of Europe, commencing\r\nprecisely at the moment when the Government of the United States first\r\nwent into operation under the constitution, excited collisions of\r\nsentiments and of sympathies, which kindled all the passions and\r\nembittered the conflict of parties, till the nation was involved in war,\r\nand the Union was shaken to its centre. This time of trial embraced a\r\nperiod of five and twenty years, during which the policy of the Union in\r\nits relations with Europe constituted the principal basis of our own\r\npolitical divisions, and the most arduous part of the action of the\r\nFederal Government. With the catastrophe in which the wars of the French\r\nRevolution terminated, and our own subsequent peace with Great Britain,\r\nthis baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From that time no\r\ndifference of principle, connected with the theory of government, or with\r\nour intercourse with foreign nations, has existed or been called forth in\r\nforce sufficient to sustain a continued combination of parties, or given\r\nmore than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate.\r\nOur political creed, without a dissenting voice that can be heard, is,\r\nthat the will of the people is the source, and the happiness of the people\r\nis the end, of all legitimate government upon earth: that the best\r\nsecurity for the beneficence, and the best guaranty against the abuse of\r\npower, consists in the freedom, the purity, and the frequency of popular\r\nelections: that the General Government of the Union, and the separate\r\nGovernments of the States, are all sovereignties of legitimate powers,\r\nfellow-servants of the same masters--uncontrolled within their respective\r\nspheres, uncontrollable by encroachments on each other. If there have been\r\nthose who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy was a\r\nGovernment competent to the wise and orderly management of the common\r\nconcerns of a mighty nation, those doubts have been dispelled. If there\r\nhave been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins\r\nof the Union, they have been scattered to the winds. If there have been\r\ndangerous attachments to one foreign nation, and antipathies against\r\nanother, they have been extinguished. Ten years of peace at home and\r\nabroad have assuaged the animosities of political contention, and blended\r\ninto harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion. There still\r\nremains one effort of magnanimity, one sacrifice of prejudice and passion,\r\nto be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have heretofore\r\nfollowed the standards of political party. It is that of discarding every\r\nremnant of rancor against each other, of embracing, as countrymen and\r\nfriends, and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence\r\nwhich, in times of contention for principle, was bestowed only upon those\r\nwho bore the badge of party communion.\r\n\r\n\"The collisions of party spirit, which originate in speculative opinions,\r\nor in different views of administrative policy, are in their nature\r\ntransitory. Those which are founded on geographical divisions, adverse\r\ninterests of soil, climate, and modes of domestic life, are more\r\npermanent, and therefore, perhaps, more dangerous. It is this which gives\r\ninestimable value to the character of our Government, at once federal and\r\nnational. It holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve, alike,\r\nand with equal anxiety, the rights of each individual State in its own\r\nGovernment, and the rights of the whole nation in that of the Union.\r\nWhatever is of domestic concernment, unconnected with the other members\r\nof the Union, or with foreign lands, belongs exclusively to the\r\nadministration of the State Governments. Whatsoever directly involves the\r\nrights and interests of the federative fraternity, or of foreign powers,\r\nis, of the resort of this General Government. The duties of both are\r\nobvious in the general principle, though sometimes perplexed with\r\ndifficulties in the detail. To respect the rights of the State Governments\r\nis the inviolable duty of that of the Union: the Government of every State\r\nwill feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the\r\nwhole. The prejudices everywhere too commonly entertained against distant\r\nstrangers are worn away, and the jealousies of jarring interests are\r\nallayed, by the composition and functions of the great national councils,\r\nannually assembled, from all quarters of the Union, at this place. Here\r\nthe distinguished men from every section of our country, while meeting to\r\ndeliberate upon the great interests of those by whom they are deputed,\r\nlearn to estimate the talents, and do justice to the virtues, of each\r\nother. The harmony of the nation is promoted, and the whole Union is knit\r\ntogether by the sentiments of mutual respect, the habits of social\r\nintercourse, and the ties of personal friendship, formed between the\r\nrepresentatives of its several parts in the performance of their service\r\nat this metropolis.\r\n\r\n\"Passing from this general review of the purposes and injunctions of the\r\nFederal constitution and their results, as indicating the first traces of\r\nthe path of duty in the discharge of my public trust, I turn to the\r\nadministration of my immediate predecessor, as the second. It has passed\r\naway in a period of profound peace: how much to the satisfaction of our\r\ncountry, and to the honor of our country's name, is known to you all. The\r\ngreat features of its policy, in general concurrence with the will of the\r\nLegislature, have been--To cherish peace while preparing for defensive war\r\nto yield exact justice to other nations, and maintain the rights of our\r\nown--to cherish the principles of freedom and equal rights, wherever they\r\nwere proclaimed--to discharge, with all possible promptitude, the national\r\ndebt--to reduce within the narrowest limits of efficiency the military\r\nforce--to improve the organization and discipline of the army--to provide\r\nand sustain a school of military science--to extend equal protection to\r\nall the great interests of the nation--to promote the civilization of the\r\nIndian tribes; and to proceed to the great system of internal\r\nimprovements, within the limits of the constitutional power of the Union.\r\nUnder the pledge of these promises, made by that eminent citizen at the\r\ntime of his first induction to this office, in his career of eight years\r\nthe internal taxes have been repealed; sixty millions of the public debt\r\nhave been discharged; provision has been made for the comfort and relief\r\nof the aged and indigent among the surviving warriors of the Revolution;\r\nthe regular armed force has been reduced, and its constitution revised and\r\nperfected; the accountability for the expenditures of public monies has\r\nbeen more effective; the Floridas have been peaceably acquired, and our\r\nboundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean; the independence of the\r\nsouthern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized, and recommended\r\nby example and by counsel to the potentates of Europe; progress has been\r\nmade in the defence of the country, by fortifications and the increase of\r\nthe navy--towards the effectual suppression of the African traffic in\r\nslaves--in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the cultivation\r\nof the soil and of the mind--in exploring the interior regions of the\r\nUnion, and in preparing, by scientific researches and surveys, for the\r\nfurther application of our national resources to the internal improvement\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n\"In this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate\r\npredecessor, the line of duty, for his successor, is clearly delineated.\r\nTo pursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our\r\ncommon condition instituted or recommended by him, will embrace the whole\r\nsphere of my obligation. To the topic of internal improvement,\r\nemphatically urged by him at his inauguration, I recur with peculiar\r\nsatisfaction. It is that from which I am convinced that the unborn\r\nmillions of our posterity, who are in future ages to people this\r\ncontinent, will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the\r\nUnion--that in which the beneficent action of its Government will be most\r\ndeeply felt and acknowledged. The magnificence and splendor of their\r\npublic works are among the imperishable glories of the ancient republics.\r\nThe roads and aqueducts of Rome have been the admiration of all after\r\nages, and have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have\r\nbeen swallowed up in despotism, or become the spoil of barbarians. Some\r\ndiversity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of Congress\r\nfor legislation upon objects of this nature. The most respectful deference\r\nis due to doubts, originating in pure patriotism, and sustained by\r\nvenerated authority. But nearly twenty years have passed since the\r\nconstruction of the first national road was commenced. The authority for\r\nits construction was then unquestioned. To how many thousands of our\r\ncountrymen has it proved a benefit? To what single individual has it ever\r\nproved an injury? Repeated, liberal and candid discussions in the\r\nLegislature have conciliated the sentiments, and approximated the opinions\r\nof enlightened minds, upon the question of constitutional power. I cannot\r\nbut hope that, by the same process of friendly, patient, and persevering\r\ndeliberation, all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed.\r\nThe extent and limitation of the powers of the General Government, in\r\nrelation to this transcendently important interest, will be settled and\r\nacknowledged to the common satisfaction of all; and every speculative\r\nscruple will be solved by a practical public blessing.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of\r\nthe recent election, which have resulted in affording me the opportunity\r\nof addressing you at this time. You have heard the exposition of the\r\nprinciples which will direct me in the fulfilment of the high and solemn\r\ntrust imposed upon me in this station. Less possessed of your confidence,\r\nin advance, than any of my predecessors, I am deeply conscious of the\r\nprospect that I shall stand more and oftener in need of your indulgence.\r\nIntentions upright and pure, a heart devoted to the welfare of our\r\ncountry, and the unceasing application of the faculties allotted to me to\r\nher service, are all the pledges that I can give for the faithful\r\nperformance of the arduous duties I am to undertake. To the guidance of\r\nthe legislative councils; to the assistance of the executive and\r\nsubordinate departments; to the friendly co-operation of the respective\r\nState Governments; to the candid and liberal support of the people, so far\r\nas it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal; I shall look for\r\nwhatever success may attend my public service: and knowing that 'except\r\nthe Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain,' with fervent\r\nsupplications for His favor, to His overruling providence I commit, with\r\nhumble but fearless confidence, my own fate, and the future destinies of\r\nmy country.\"\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the discharge of his duties as President, Mr. Adams\r\nproceeded to form his cabinet by nominating Henry Clay, of Kentucky,\r\nSecretary of State; Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury; James Barbour, of Virginia,   Secretary of War; Samuel L.\r\nSouthard, Secretary of the Navy, and Wm. Wirt, Attorney General. These\r\nwere all men of superior talents, of tried integrity and faithfulness, and\r\nwell worthy the elevated positions to which they were called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCHARGES OF CORRUPTION AGAINST MR. CLAY AND MR. ADAMS--MR. ADAMS ENTERS\r\nUPON HIS DUTIES AS PRESIDENT--VISIT OF LA FAYETTE--TOUR THROUGH THE\r\nUNITED STATES--MR. ADAMS DELIVERS HIM A FAREWELL ADDRESS--DEPARTS FROM THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe election of Mr. Adams to the presidency, was a severe disappointment\r\nto the friends of Gen. Jackson. As the latter had received a majority of\r\nfifteen electoral votes over Mr. Adams, it was confidently anticipated,\r\nnay, virtually demanded, that he should be elected by the House of\r\nRepresentatives. This claim, it was insisted, was in accordance with the\r\nwill of the people, as expressed in the electoral colleges, and to resist\r\nit would be to violate the spirit of the constitution, and to set at\r\nnought the fundamental principles of our republican Government. A\r\nsufficient reply to these positions is found in the fact, that Gen.\r\nJackson did not receive a majority of the electoral votes, and hence a\r\nmajority of the people could not be considered as desiring his election.\r\nThe absolute truth, subsequently obtained on this point, was, that Mr.\r\nAdams had received more of the primary votes of the people than Gen.\r\nJackson; and thus, according to all republican principles, was entitled to\r\nbe considered the first choice of the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe position of Mr. Clay, in this contest for the presidency, was one of\r\ngreat delicacy and difficulty. He was precisely in that critical posture,\r\nthat, whatever course he might pursue, he would be subject to\r\nmisrepresentation and censure, and could not but raise up a host of\r\nenemies. Originally one of the four candidates for the presidency, he\r\nfailed, by five electoral votes, in having a sufficient number to be one\r\nof the three candidates returned to the House of Representatives, of which\r\nhe was then Speaker. In this posture of affairs, it was evident that upon\r\nthe course which should be pursued by Mr. Clay, and his friends in the\r\nHouse, depended the question who should be elected President. As Mr.\r\nCrawford, on account of the critical state of his health, was considered\r\nout of the question, Mr. Clay was left to choose between Mr. Adams and\r\nGen. Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn this posture of affairs, Mr. Clay saw, that however patriotic the\r\nprinciples on which he acted, and however pure the motives by which he\r\nmight be governed in making his selection, he must inevitably expose\r\nhimself to the severest animadversions from the defeated party. But he did\r\nnot hesitate, in the discharge of what he believed to be a solemn duty he\r\nowed his country, to throw his influence in behalf of the man whom he\r\nbelieved the best fitted to serve that country in the responsible office\r\nof the presidency. Long before it had been foreseen such a contingency\r\nwould occur, he had expressed his want of confidence in the ability and\r\nfitness of Gen. Jackson for the executive chair. But in Mr. Adams he saw a\r\nman of the utmost purity and integrity of private character--a scholar of\r\nthe ripest abilities--a statesman, a diplomatist, a patriot of\r\nunquestioned talents and of long experience,--one who had been entrusted\r\nwith most important public interests by Washington, Adams, Jefferson,\r\nMadison and Monroe, and also had received from these illustrious men every\r\nmark of confidence--whose familiarity with the internal condition and\r\nforeign relations of the Union was unequalled by any public man! Between\r\nmen so dissimilar in their qualifications, how could Mr. Clay, with the\r\nslightest regard to the welfare of the nation, the claims of patriotism,\r\nor the dictates of his conscience, hesitate to choose? He did not\r\nhesitate. With an intrepid determination to meet all consequences, he\r\nthrew his influence in behalf of Mr. Adams, and secured his election.\r\n\r\nThis decisive step, as had been clearly foreseen, drew upon the head of\r\nMr. Clay the severest censures of the supporters of Gen. Jackson. Motives\r\nof the deepest political corruption were attributed to him. They charged\r\nhim with making a deliberate stipulation or \"bargain\" with Mr. Adams, to\r\ngive his influence, on the understanding that he was to receive, in\r\npayment, the appointment to the state department. The undoubted object of\r\nthis charge was to ruin Mr. Clay's future prospects, and make capital to\r\nthe advantage of Gen. Jackson in the next presidential campaign. It\r\nimplicated Mr. Adams equally with Mr. Clay. If the latter had been so\r\ncorrupt as to offer his support on the promise of office, the former was\r\nquite as guilty in accepting of terms so venal. There never was a more\r\nbase charge against American statesmen--there never was one more entirely\r\ndestitute of foundation, or even shadow of proof! It was at no time\r\nconsidered entitled to the slightest particle of belief by those who were\r\nat Washington during these transactions and had an opportunity of knowing\r\nthe true state of things at that time. But there were many, throughout the\r\ncountry, too ready to receive such reports in regard to public men. Both\r\nMr. Adams and Mr. Clay were greatly prejudiced by this alleged\r\ncollusion--a prejudice which years did not efface.\r\n\r\nThis charge first appeared in a tangible form shortly previous to the\r\nelection by the House of Representatives, in an anonymous letter in the\r\n\"Columbian Observer,\" at Philadelphia. It was soon ascertained to have\r\nbeen written by Mr. Kremer, a member of the House of Representatives from\r\nPennsylvania. Mr. Clay immediately published a card in the National\r\nIntelligencer, denying, in unequivocal terms, the allegation, and\r\npronouncing the author \"an infamous calumniator, a dastard, and a liar!\"\r\n\r\nA few days after this, Mr. Kremer acknowledged himself the author of the\r\nletter in the \"Columbian Observer,\" and professed himself ready to prove\r\nthe corruptions alleged: whereupon Mr. Clay demanded that the House raise\r\na committee to investigate the case. The committee was appointed; but Mr.\r\nKremer, on grounds of the most frivolous description, refused to appear\r\nbefore the committee, or to furnish a particle of proof of the truth of\r\nthe grave assertions he had uttered--thus virtually acknowledging their\r\nslanderous character.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay being in this manner denied the privilege of vindicating his\r\ninnocence, and showing the depravity of his accusers, the matter continued\r\nin an unsettled state until the next presidential campaign, when it was\r\nrevived in a more tangible form, and brought to bear adversely to Mr.\r\nAdams's administration and reelection. In 1827, Gen. Jackson, in a letter\r\nto Mr. Carter Beverly, which soon appeared in public print, made the\r\nfollowing statement:--\r\n\r\n\"Early in January, 1825, a member of Congress of high respectability\r\nvisited me one morning, and observed that he had a communication he was\r\ndesirous to make to me; that he was informed there was a great intrigue\r\ngoing on, and that it was right I should be informed of it. * * * * * * *\r\nHe said he had been informed by the friends of Mr. Clay, that the friends\r\nof Mr. Adams had made overtures to them, saying, if Mr. Clay and his\r\nfriends would unite in aid of Mr. Adams's election, Mr. Clay should be\r\nSecretary of State; that the friends of Mr. Adams were urging, as a reason\r\nto induce the friends of Mr. Clay to accede to their proposition, that if\r\nI were elected President, Mr. Adams would be continued Secretary of State;\r\nthat the friends of Mr. Clay stated the West did not wish to separate from\r\nthe West, and if I would say, or permit any of my confidential friends to\r\nsay, that in case I were elected President Mr. Adams should not be\r\ncontinued Secretary of State, by a complete union of Mr. Clay and his\r\nfriends, they would put an end to the presidential contest in one hour.\r\nAnd he was of opinion it was right to fight such intriguers with their\r\nown weapons.\"\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent statement, Gen. Jackson asserted that the gentleman who\r\ncalled upon him with these propositions was James Buchanan, of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis was the Kremer charge made definite in circumstances and\r\napplication; and if well grounded, was susceptible of plain proof. On the\r\nappearance of this statement by Gen. Jackson, Mr. Clay came out with a\r\npositive denial. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"I neither made, nor authorized, nor knew of any proposition whatever, to\r\neither of the three candidates who were returned to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, at the last presidential election, or to the friends of\r\neither of them, for the purpose of influencing the result of the election,\r\nor for any other purpose. And all allegations, intimations, and\r\ninuendoes, that my vote on that occasion was offered to be given, or was\r\nin fact given, in consideration of any stipulation or understanding,\r\nexpress or implied, direct or indirect, written or verbal,--that I was, or\r\nthat any other person was not, to be appointed Secretary of State; or that\r\nI was, or in any other manner to be, personally benefitted,--are devoid\r\nof all truth, and destitute of any foundation whatever.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a direct collision between Gen. Jackson and Mr. Clay. All now\r\nrested with Mr. Buchanan. His testimony would either prostrate Mr. Clay,\r\nor place him, in regard to this matter, beyond the reach of the foulest\r\ntongue of calumny. In due time Mr. Buchanan made his statement, in which\r\nhe denied, in unequivocal language, having made any such proposition to\r\nGen. Jackson. In his explanation he says:--\r\n\r\n\"I called upon General Jackson solely as his friend, upon my individual\r\nresponsibility, and not as the agent of Mr. Clay, or any other person. I\r\nnever have been the political friend of Mr. Clay, since he became a\r\ncandidate for the office of President. Until I saw General Jackson's\r\nletter to Mr. Beverly, of the 6th ult., and at the same time was informed,\r\nby a letter from the editor of the United States Telegraph, that I was the\r\nperson to whom he alluded, the conception never once entered my head, that\r\nhe believed me to be the agent of Mr. Clay, or of his friends, or that I\r\nhad intended to propose to him terms of any kind from them, or that he\r\ncould have supposed me to be capable of expressing the opinion that 'it\r\nwas right to fight such intriguers with their own weapons.' Such a\r\nsupposition, had I entertained it, would have rendered me exceedingly\r\nunhappy, as there is no man on earth whose good opinion I more valued than\r\nthat of General Jackson. * * * * * * * * * I owe it to my character to\r\nmake another observation. Had I ever known, or even suspected, that\r\nGeneral Jackson believed I had been sent to him by Mr. Clay or his\r\nfriends, I should immediately have corrected his erroneous impression, and\r\nthus prevented the necessity for this most unpleasant explanation. * * * *\r\n* * * I had no authority from Mr. Clay, or his friends, to propose any\r\nterms to General Jackson in relation to their votes, nor did I ever make\r\nany such proposition.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement fully and triumphantly exonerated Mr. Clay, Mr. Adams, and\r\ntheir friends, from the charge of \"bargain\" and \"corruption,\" which had\r\nbeen so boldly made and widely disseminated. The only witness ever brought\r\nupon the stand to support such an allegation, asserted, in a manner the\r\nmost positive and decisive, the entire innocence of the parties\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Clay, in throwing his influence in behalf of Mr. Adams, was but\r\nfollowing out a resolution formed long before he had any opportunity of\r\ncommunication with Mr. Adams or his friends, on the subject, is proved by\r\nthe following extract of a letter from a gentleman in Lexington, Ky., to\r\nthe editors of the National Intelligencer, dated March 21, 1825:--\r\n\r\n\"At different times, before Mr. Clay left this place for Washington, last\r\nfall, I had conversations with him on the subject of the choice of a\r\nPresident by the House of Representatives. In all of them, he expressed\r\nhimself as having long before decided in favor of Mr. Adams, in case the\r\ncontest should lie between that gentleman and General Jackson. My last\r\ninterview with him was, I think, the day before his departure, when he was\r\nstill more explicit, as it was then certain that the election would be\r\ntransferred to that tribunal, and highly probable that he would not be\r\namong the number returned. In the course of this conversation, I took\r\noccasion to express my sentiments with respect to the delicate and\r\ndifficult circumstances under which he would be placed. He remarked that I\r\ncould not more fully apprehend them than he did himself; but that nothing\r\nshould deter him from the duty of giving his vote; and that no state of\r\nthings could arise that would justify him in preferring General Jackson to\r\nMr. Adams, or induce him to support the former. So decisive, indeed, were\r\nhis declarations on this subject, that had he voted otherwise than he did,\r\nI should have been compelled to regard him as deserving that species of\r\ncensure which has been cast upon him for constantly adhering to an early\r\nand deliberate resolution.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thought, by some of Mr. Clay's friends, that he erred in judgment\r\nin accepting the office of Secretary of State, as it would tend to\r\nstrengthen his enemies in their efforts to fix upon him the charge of\r\ncorruption. Among those entertaining this opinion was Mr. Crawford,\r\nhimself one of the three presidential candidates returned to the House of\r\nRepresentatives. In a letter to Mr. Clay he says:--\r\n\r\n\"I hope you know me too well to suppose that I have countenanced the\r\ncharge of corruption which has been reiterated against you. The truth is,\r\nI approved of your vote when it was given, and should have voted as you\r\ndid between Jackson and Adams. But candor compells me to say, that I\r\ndisapproved of your accepting an office under him.\"\r\n\r\nIn replying to this letter Mr. Clay remarked:--\r\n\r\n\"I do, my dear sir, know you too well to suppose that you ever\r\ncountenanced the charge of corruption against me. No man of sense and\r\ncandor--at least none that know me--ever could or did countenance it. Your\r\nfrank admission that you would have voted as I did, between Mr. Adams and\r\nGen. Jackson, accords with the estimate I have ever made of your\r\nintelligence, your independence, and your patriotism. Nor am I at all\r\nsurprised, or dissatisfied, with the expression of your opinion, that I\r\nerred in accepting the place which I now hold. * * * * * * * The truth is,\r\nas I have often said, my condition was one full of embarrassments,\r\nwhatever way I might act. My own judgment was rather opposed to my\r\nacceptance of the department of state. But my friends--and let me add, two\r\nof your best friends, Mr. McLane of Delaware and Mr. Forsyth--urged us\r\nstrongly not to decline it. It was represented by my friends, that I\r\nshould get no credit for the forbearance, but that, on the contrary, it\r\nwould be said that my forbearance was evidence of my having made a\r\nbargain, though unwilling to execute it. * * * * * * * * These and other\r\nsimilar arguments were pressed upon me; and after a week's deliberation, I\r\nyielded to their force. It is quite possible that I may have erred * * * *\r\n* * I shall, at least, have no cause of self-reproach.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1829, after Mr. Adams had retired from the Presidential chair, in reply\r\nto a letter from a committee of gentlemen in New Jersey, who had addressed\r\nhim, he spoke of Mr. Clay as follows: \"Upon him the foulest slanders have\r\nbeen showered. Long known and appreciated, as successively a member of\r\nboth Houses of your national Legislature, as the unrivalled Speaker, and\r\nat the same time most efficient leader of debates in one of them; as an\r\nable and successful negotiator of your interests, in war and peace, with\r\nforeign powers, and as a powerful candidate for the highest of your\r\ntrusts, the department of state itself was a station which by its bestowal\r\ncould confer neither profit nor honor upon him, but upon which he has shed\r\nunfading honor, by the manner in which he has discharged its duties.\r\nPrejudice and passion have charged him with obtaining that office by\r\nbargain and corruption. Before you, my fellow-citizens, in the presence of\r\nour country and heaven, I pronounce that charge totally unfounded. This\r\ntribute of justice is due from me to him, and I seize with pleasure the\r\nopportunity afforded me by your letter, of discharging the obligation. As\r\nto my motives for tendering to him the department of state when I did, let\r\nthat man who questions them come forward; let him look around among\r\nstatesmen and legislators, of this nation, and of that day; let him then\r\nselect and name the man whom, by his pre-eminent talents, by his splendid\r\nservices, by his ardent patriotism, by his all-embracing public spirit, by\r\nhis fervid eloquence in behalf of the rights and liberties of mankind, and\r\nby his long experience in the affairs of the Union, foreign and domestic,\r\na President of the United States, intent only upon the welfare and honor\r\nof his country, ought to have preferred to HENRY CLAY. Let him name the\r\nman, and then judge you, my fellow-citizens, of my motives.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Adams was on a tour in the western States, in the fall of 1843,\r\nin addressing the chairman of the committee of his reception, at\r\nMaysville, Kentucky, he said: \"I thank you, sir, for the opportunity you\r\nhave given me of speaking of the great statesman who was associated with\r\nme in the administration of the General Government, at my earnest\r\nsolicitation; who belongs not to Kentucky alone, but to the whole Union;\r\nand who is not only an honor to this State, and this nation, but to\r\nmankind. The charges to which you refer, after my term of service had\r\nexpired, and it was proper for me to speak, I denied before the whole\r\ncountry. And I here reiterate and re-affirm that denial; and as I expect\r\nshortly to appear before my God, to answer for the conduct of my whole\r\nlife, should these charges have found their way to the throne of eternal\r\njustice, I WILL in the presence of OMNIPOTENCE pronounce them FALSE.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the world Mr. Clay and Mr. Adams stand acquitted of the calumny\r\nwhich their enemies endeavored, with an industry worthy a better cause, to\r\nheap upon them. The history of their country will do them ample justice.\r\nTheir names shall stand upon its pages, illuminated by a well-earned fame\r\nfor patriotism and faithful devotion to public interests, when those of\r\ntheir accusers will be lost in a merited oblivion.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, having entered upon his duties as President of the United\r\nStates, prosecuted them with all that diligence and industrious\r\napplication which was one of the leading characteristics of his life.\r\nUnawed by the opposition and the misrepresentations of his political\r\nenemies, and uncorrupted by the power and influence at his control, he\r\npursued the even tenor of his way, having a single object in view, the\r\npromotion of the welfare of the people over whom he had been called to\r\npreside.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the heart of the nation was being stirred by old and\r\nvalued reminiscences. LA FAYETTE,--a hero of the revolution--the\r\ncompanion of Washington--whose blood had enriched American soil in\r\ndefence of American freedom--had expressed a wish to re-visit once more,\r\nbefore departing life, the scenes of his early struggles and well-earned\r\nglories. This intimation was first given in the following letter to Col.\r\nWillet, an old friend and fellow-soldier of La Fayette, who was then\r\nstill living in New-York.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"Paris, July 15, 1822.\r\n\"My DEAR SIR:--I avail myself of a good opportunity to remind you of your\r\nold friend and fellow-soldier, in whose heart no time nor distance can\r\nabate the patriotic remembrance and personal affections of our\r\nrevolutionary times. We remain but too few survivors of that glorious\r\nepoch, in which the fate of two hemispheres has been decided. It is an\r\nadditional monitor to think more of the ties of brotherly friendship which\r\nunited us. May it be in my power, before I join our departed companions,\r\nto visit such of them as are still inhabitants of the United States, and\r\nto tell you personally, my dear Willet, how affectionately\r\n                             \"I am your sincere friend,   LA FAYETTE.\"\r\n\r\nIntelligence of this desire to visit America having reached Congress,\r\nresolutions were passed placing a Government ship at his disposal:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas that distinguished champion of freedom, and hero of our\r\nRevolution, the friend and associate of Washington, the Marquis de La\r\nFayette, a volunteer General Officer in our Revolutionary War, has\r\nexpressed an anxious desire to visit this country, the independence of\r\nwhich his valor, blood, and treasure, were so instrumental in achieving:\r\nTherefore--\r\n\r\n\"Be it Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United\r\nStates be requested to communicate to the Marquis de La Fayette the\r\nexpression of those sentiments of profound respect, gratitude, and\r\naffectionate attachment, which are cherished towards him by the Government\r\nand people of this country; and to assure him that the execution of his\r\nwish and intention to visit this country, will be hailed by the people and\r\nGovernment with patriotic pride and joy.\r\n\r\n\"And be it further Resolved, That the President of the United States be\r\nrequested to ascertain from the Marquis de La Fayette, the time when it\r\nwill be most agreeable for him to perform his visit; and that he offer to\r\nthe Marquis a conveyance to this country in one of our national ships.\"\r\n\r\nLa Fayette modestly declined this offer of a public ship. He sailed from\r\nHavre in the packet-ship Cadmus, accompanied by his son, George\r\nWashington La Fayette, and arrived in New York on the 15th of August,\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nHis reception at New York was sublime and brilliant in the extreme. The\r\nmeeting between La Fayette, Col. Willet, Gen. Van Cortland, Gen.\r\nClarkson, and other revolutionary worthies, was highly affecting. He knew\r\nthem all. After the ceremony of embracing and congratulations were over,\r\nLa Fayette sat down by the side of Col. Willet. \"Do you remember,\" said\r\nthe colonel, \"at the battle of Monmouth, I was a volunteer aid to Gen.\r\nScott? I saw you in the heat of battle, you were but a boy, but you were a\r\nserious and sedate lad.\" \"Aye, aye,\" returned La Fayette, \"I remember\r\nwell. And on the Mohawk I sent you fifty Indians, and you wrote me that\r\nthey set up such a yell that they frightened the British horse, and they\r\nran one way, and the Indians another.\" Thus these veteran soldiers \"fought\r\ntheir battles o'er again.\"\r\n\r\nFrom New York La Fayette proceeded on a tour throughout the United\r\nStates. Everywhere he was received and honored, as \"THE NATION'S GUEST.\"\r\nFor more than a year, his journey was a complete ovation--a perpetual and\r\nsplendid pageant. The people appeared delirious with joy and with anxiety\r\nto hail him, grasp him by the hand, and shower attentions and honors upon\r\nhim. The gratitude and love of all persons, of every age, sex, and\r\ncondition, seemed hardly to be restrained within bounds of propriety. As\r\nhe passed through the country, every city, village, and hamlet, poured out\r\nits inhabitants en masse, to meet him. Celebrations, processions, dinners,\r\nilluminations, bonfires, parties, balls, serenades, and rejoicings of\r\nevery description, attended his way, from the moment he set foot on the\r\nAmerican soil, until his embarkation to return to his native France.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the people in the most distant parts of the Western\r\nHemisphere were warmed and touched with the honors paid him in the United\r\nStates. A letter written at that time from Buenos Ayres, says--\"I have\r\njust received newspapers from the United States, informing me of the\r\nmagnificent reception of Gen. La Fayette. I have never read newspapers\r\nwith such exquisite delight as these; and I firmly believe there never was\r\nso interesting and glorious an event in the civilized world, in which all\r\nclasses of people participated in the general joy, as on this occasion.\r\nThere is an association of ideas connected with this event, that produces\r\nin my soul emotions I cannot express, and fills my heart with such\r\ngrateful recollections as I cannot forget but with my existence. That ten\r\nmillions of souls, actuated by pure sentiments of gratitude and\r\nfriendship, should with one voice pronounce this individual the 'Guest of\r\nthe Nation,' and pay him the highest honors the citizens of a free nation\r\ncan offer, is an event which must excite the astonishment of Europe, and\r\nshow the inestimable value of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1825, La Fayette visited Boston, and on the 17th day of that\r\nmonth, it being the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill, he\r\nparticipated in the ceremony of laying the corner stone of the monument in\r\ncommemoration of that event, on Bunker Hill. During his tour at the east,\r\nhe visited the venerable ex-President John Adams, at Quincy.\r\n\r\nBut the time for his departure drew near. His journey had extended as far\r\nsouth as New Orleans, west to St. Louis, north and east to Massachusetts.\r\nHe had passed through, or touched, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nOhio, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nA new frigate, the Brandywine, named in honor of the gallant exploits of\r\nGen. La Fayette at the battle of Brandywine, was provided by Congress to\r\nconvey him to France. It was deemed appropriate that he should take final\r\nleave of the nation at the seat of government in Washington. President\r\nAdams invited him to pass a few weeks in the presidential mansion. Mr.\r\nAdams had been on intimate terms with La Fayette in his youth, with whom,\r\nit is said, he was a marked favorite. During his sojourn at the capitol,\r\nhe visited ex-Presidents Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, at their several\r\nplaces of residence.\r\n\r\nHaving paid his respects to these venerated sages, \"the Nation's Guest\"\r\nprepared to take his final departure from the midst of a grateful people.\r\nThe 7th of September, 1825, was the day appointed for taking leave.  About\r\n12 o'clock, the officers of the General Government, civil, military, and\r\nnaval, together with the authorities of Washington, Georgetown, and\r\nAlexandria, with multitudes of citizens and strangers, assembled in the\r\nPresident's house. La Fayette entered the great hall in silence, leaning\r\non the Marshal of the District, and one of the sons of the President. Mr.\r\nAdams then with evident emotion, but with much dignity and firmness,\r\naddressed him in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL LA FAYETTE: It has been the good fortune of many of my fellow-\r\ncitizens, during the course of the year now elapsed, upon your arrival at\r\ntheir respective places of abode to greet you with the welcome of the\r\nnation. The less pleasing task now devolves upon me, of bidding you, in\r\nthe name of the nation, ADIEU!\r\n\r\n\"It were no longer seasonable, and would be superfluous, to recapitulate\r\nthe remarkable incidents of your early life--incidents which associated\r\nyour name, fortunes, and reputation, in imperishable connection with the\r\nindependence and history of the North American Union.\r\n\r\n\"The part which you performed at that important juncture was marked with\r\ncharacters so peculiar, that, realizing the fairest fable of antiquity,\r\nits parallel could scarcely be found in the authentic records of human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\"You deliberately and perseveringly preferred toil, danger, the endurance\r\nof every hardship, and privation of every comfort, in defence of a holy\r\ncause, to inglorious ease, and the allurements of rank, affluence, and\r\nunrestrained youth, at the most splendid and fascinating court of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"That this choice was not less wise than magnanimous, the sanction of half\r\na century, and the gratulations of unnumbered voices, all unable to\r\nexpress the gratitude of the heart, with which your visit to this\r\nhemisphere has been welcomed, afford ample demonstration.\r\n\r\n\"When the contest of freedom, to which you had repaired as a voluntary\r\nchampion, had closed, by the complete triumph of her cause in this country\r\nof your adoption, you returned to fulfil the duties of the philanthropist\r\nand patriot, in the land of your nativity. There, in a consistent and\r\nundeviating career of forty years, you have maintained, through every\r\nvicissitude of alternate success and disappointment, the same glorious\r\ncause to which the first years of your active life had been devoted, the\r\nimprovement of the moral and political condition of man.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout that long succession of time, the people of the United States,\r\nfor whom and with whom you have fought the battles of liberty, have been\r\nliving in the full possession of its fruits; one of the happiest among the\r\nfamily of nations. Spreading in population; enlarging in territory; acting\r\nand suffering according to the condition of their nature; and laying the\r\nfoundations of the greatest, and, we humbly hope, the most beneficent\r\npower, that ever regulated the concerns of man upon earth.\r\n\r\n\"In that lapse of forty years, the generation of men with whom you\r\nco-operated in the conflict of arms, has nearly passed away. Of the\r\ngeneral officers of the American army in that war, you alone survive. Of\r\nthe sages who guided our councils; of the warriors who met the foe in the\r\nfield, or upon the wave, with the exception of a few to whom unusual\r\nlength of days has been allotted by Heaven, all now sleep with their\r\nfathers. A succeeding, and even a third generation, have arisen to take\r\ntheir places; and their children's children, while rising up to call them\r\nblessed, have been taught by them, as well as admonished by their own\r\nconstant enjoyment of freedom, to include in every benison upon their\r\nfathers, the name of him, who came from afar, with them and in their cause\r\nto conquer or to fall.\r\n\r\n\"The universal prevalence of these sentiments was signally manifested by a\r\nresolution of Congress, representing the whole people, and all the States\r\nof this Union, requesting the President of the United States to\r\ncommunicate to you the assurances of the grateful and affectionate\r\nattachment of this government and people, and desiring that a national\r\nship might be employed, at your convenience, for your passage to the\r\nborders of our country.\r\n\r\n\"The invitation was transmitted to you by my venerable predecessor,\r\nhimself bound to you by the strongest ties of personal friendship; himself\r\none of those whom the highest honors of his country had rewarded for blood\r\nearly shed in her cause, and for a long life of devotion to her welfare.\r\nBy him the services of a national ship were placed at your disposal. Your\r\ndelicacy preferred a more private conveyance, and a full year has elapsed\r\nsince you landed upon our shores. It were scarcely an exaggeration to say\r\nthat it has been to the people of the Union a year of uninterrupted\r\nfestivity and enjoyment, inspired by your presence. You have traversed the\r\ntwenty-four States of this great confederacy--you have been received with\r\nrapture by the survivors of your earliest companions in arms-you have been\r\nhailed, as a long-absent parent, by their children, the men and women of\r\nthe present age; and a rising generation, the hope of future time, in\r\nnumbers surpassing the whole population of that day when you fought at the\r\nhead and by the side of their forefathers, have vied with the scanty\r\nremnants of that hour of trial, in acclamations of joy, at beholding the\r\nface of him whom they feel to be the common benefactor of all. You have\r\nheard the mingled voices of the past, the present, and the future age,\r\njoining in one universal chorus of delight at your approach; and the\r\nshouts of unbidden thousands, which greeted your landing on the soil of\r\nfreedom, have followed every step of your way, and still resound like the\r\nrushing of many waters, from every corner of our land.\r\n\r\n\"You are now about to return to the country of your birth--of your\r\nancestors--of your posterity. The executive Government of the Union,\r\nstimulated by the same feeling which had prompted the Congress to the\r\ndesignation of a national ship for your accommodation in coming hither,\r\nhas destined the first service of a frigate, recently launched at this\r\nmetropolis, to the less welcome, but equally distinguished trust, of\r\nconveying you home. The name of the ship has added one more memorial to\r\ndistant regions and to future ages, of a stream already memorable at once\r\nin the story of your sufferings and of our independence.\r\n\r\n\"The ship is now prepared for your reception, and equipped for sea. From\r\nthe moment of her departure, the prayers of millions will ascend to\r\nheaven, that her passage may be prosperous, and your return to the bosom\r\nof your family as propitious to your happiness as your visit to this scene\r\nof your youthful glory has been to that of the American people.\r\n\r\n\"Go then, our beloved friend: return to the land of brilliant genius, of\r\ngenerous sentiments, of heroic valor; to that beautiful France, the\r\nnursing mother of the twelfth Louis, and the fourth Henry; to the native\r\nsoil of Bayard and Coligne, of Turenne and Catinat, of Fenelon and\r\nD'Aguesseau! In that illustrious catalogue of names, which she claims as\r\nof her children, and with honest pride holds up to the admiration of other\r\nnations, the name of LA FAYETTE has already for centuries been enrolled.\r\nAnd it shall henceforth burnish into brighter fame: for, if in after days,\r\na Frenchman shall be called to indicate the character of his nation by\r\nthat of one individual, during the age in which we live, the blood of\r\nlofty patriotism shall mantle in his cheek, the fire of conscious virtue\r\nshall sparkle in his eye, and he shall pronounce the name of LA FAYETTE.\r\nYet we, too, and our children in life, and after death, shall claim you\r\nfor our own. You are ours, by that more than patriotic self-devotion with\r\nwhich you flew to the aid of our fathers at the crisis of their fate: ours\r\nby that long series of years in which you have cherished us in your\r\nregard: ours by that unshaken sentiment of gratitude for your services,\r\nwhich is a precious portion of our inheritance: ours by that tie of love,\r\nstronger then death, which has linked your name, for the endless ages of\r\ntime, with the name of WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\"At the painful moment of parting from you, we take comfort in the\r\nthought, that wherever you may be, to the last pulsation of your heart,\r\nour country will ever be present to your affections; and a cheering\r\nconsolation assures us that we are not called to sorrow, most of all, that\r\nwe shall see your face no more. We shall indulge the pleasing anticipation\r\nof beholding our friend again. In the mean time, speaking in the name of\r\nthe whole people of the United States, and at a loss only for language to\r\ngive utterance to that feeling of attachment with which the heart of the\r\nnation beats, as beats the heart of one man--I bid you a reluctant and\r\naffectionate FAREWELL!!\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this address, Gen. La Fayette replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Amidst all my obligations to the General Government, and particularly to\r\nyou, sir, its respected Chief Magistrate, I have most thankfully to\r\nacknowledge the opportunity given me, at this solemn and painful moment,\r\nto present the people of the United States with a parting tribute of\r\nprofound, inexpressible gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"To have been in the infant and critical days of these States adopted by\r\nthem as a favorite son; to have participated in the trials and perils of\r\nour unspotted struggle for independence, freedom, and equal rights, and in\r\nthe foundation of the American era of a new social order, which has\r\nalready pervaded this, and must, for the dignity and happiness of mankind,\r\nsuccessively pervade every part of the other hemisphere; to have received,\r\nat every stage of the revolution, and during forty years after that\r\nperiod, from the people of the United State's and their Representatives at\r\nhome and abroad, continual marks of their confidence and kindness,--has\r\nbeen the pride, the encouragement, the support of a long and eventful\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"But how could I find words to acknowledge that series of welcomes, those\r\nunbounded and universal displays of public affection, which have marked\r\neach step, each hour, of a twelvemonth's progress through the twenty-four\r\nStates, and which, while they overwhelm my heart with grateful delight,\r\nhave most satisfactorily evinced the concurrence of the people in the kind\r\ntestimonies, in the immense favors bestowed on me by the several branches\r\nof their Representatives, in every part and at the central seat of the\r\nconfederacy?\r\n\r\n\"Yet gratifications still higher awaited me. In the wonders of creation\r\nand improvement that have met my enchanted eye, in the unparalleled and\r\nself-felt happiness of the people, in their rapid prosperity and insured\r\nsecurity, public and private, in a practice of good order, the appendage\r\nof true freedom, and a national good sense, the final arbiter of all\r\ndifficulties, I have had proudly to recognize a result of the republican\r\nprinciples for which we have fought, and a glorious demonstration to the\r\nmost timid and prejudiced minds, of the superiority, over degrading\r\naristocracy or despotism, of popular institutions, founded on the plain\r\nrights of man, and where the local rights of every section are preserved\r\nunder a constitutional bond of union. The cherishing of that union between\r\nthe States, as it has been the farewell entreaty of our great paternal\r\nWashington, and will ever have the dying prayer of every American patriot,\r\nso it has become the sacred pledge of the emancipation of the world; an\r\nobject in which I am happy to observe that the American people, while they\r\ngive the animating example of successful free institutions, in return for\r\nan evil entailed upon them by Europe, and of which a liberal and\r\nenlightened sense is everywhere more and more generally felt, show\r\nthemselves every day more anxiously interested.\r\n\r\n\"And now, sir, how can I do justice to my deep and lively feelings for the\r\nassurances, most peculiarly valued, of your esteem and friendship; for\r\nyour so very kind references to old times--to my beloved associates--to\r\nthe vicissitudes of my life; for your affecting picture of the blessings\r\npoured, by the several generations of the American people, on the\r\nremaining days of a delighted veteran; for your affectionate remarks on\r\nthis sad hour of separation--on the country of my birth, full, I can say,\r\nof American sympathies--on the hope, so necessary to me, of my seeing\r\nagain the country that has deigned, near a half a century ago, to call me\r\nhers? I shall content myself, refraining from superfluous repetitions, at\r\nonce, before you, sir, and this respected circle, to proclaim my cordial\r\nconfirmation of everyone of the sentiments which I have had daily\r\nopportunities publicly to utter, from the time when your venerable\r\npredecessor, my old brother in arms and friend, transmitted to me the\r\nhonorable invitation of Congress, to this day, when you, my dear sir,\r\nwhose friendly connection with me dates from your earliest youth, are\r\ngoing to consign me to the protection, across the Atlantic, of the heroic\r\nnational flag, on board the splendid ship, the name of which has been not\r\nthe least flattering and kind among the numberless favors conferred upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, sir, and all who surround us. God bless the American\r\npeople, each of their States, and the Federal Government. Accept this\r\npatriotic farewell of an overflowing heart. Such will be its last throb\r\nwhen it ceases to beat.\"\r\n\r\nAs the last sentence of the farewell was pronounced, La Fayette advanced\r\nand took President Adams in his arms, while tears poured down his\r\nvenerable cheeks. Retiring a few paces, he was overcome by his feelings,\r\nand again returned, and falling on the neck of Mr. Adams, exclaimed in\r\nbroken accents, \"God bless you!\" It was a scene at once solemn and moving,\r\nas the sighs and tears of many who witnessed it bore testimony. Having\r\nrecovered his self-possession, the General stretched out his hands, and\r\nwas in a moment surrounded by the greetings of the whole assembly, who\r\npressed upon him, each eager to seize, perhaps for the last time, that\r\nbeloved hand which was opened so freely for our aid when aid was so\r\nprecious, and which grasped with firm and undeviating hold the steel which\r\nso bravely helped to achieve our deliverance. The expression which now\r\nbeamed from the face of this exalted man was of the finest and most\r\ntouching kind. The hero was lost in the father and the friend. Dignity\r\nmelted into subdued affection, and the friend of Washington seemed to\r\nlinger with a mournful delight among the sons of his adopted country.\r\n\r\nA considerable period was then occupied in conversing with various\r\nindividuals, while refreshments were presented to the company. The moment\r\nof departure at length arrived; and having once more pressed the hand of\r\nMr. Adams, he entered the barouche, accompanied by the Secretaries of\r\nState, of the Treasury, and of the Navy, and passed from the capital of\r\nthe Union. An immense procession accompanied him to the banks of the\r\nPotomac, where the steamboat Mount Vernon awaited to convey him down the\r\nriver to the frigate Brandywine. The whole scene--the peals of artillery,\r\nthe sounds of numerous military bands, the presence of the vast concourse\r\nof people, and the occasion that assembled them, produced emotions not\r\neasily described, but which every American heart can readily conceive. As\r\nthe steamboat moved off, the deepest silence was observed by the whole\r\nmultitude that lined the shore. The feelings that pervaded them was that\r\nof children bidding farewell to a venerated parent.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat came opposite the tomb of Washington, at Mount Vernon, it\r\npaused in its progress. La Fayette arose. The wonders which he had\r\nperformed, for a man of his age, in successfully accomplishing labors\r\nenough to have tested his meridian vigor, whose animation rather resembled\r\nthe spring than the winter of life, now seemed unequal to the task he was\r\nabout to perform--to take a last look at \"The tomb of Washington!\" He\r\nadvanced to the effort. A silence the most impressive reigned around, till\r\nthe strains of sweet and plaintive music completed the grandeur and sacred\r\nsolemnity of the scene. All hearts beat in unison with the throbbings of\r\nthe veteran's bosom, as he looked, for the last time, on the sepulchre\r\nwhich contained the ashes of the first of men! He spoke not, but appeared\r\nabsorbed in the mighty recollections which the place and the occasion\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nAfter this scene, the boat resumed its course, and the next morning\r\nanchored in safety near the Brandywine. Here La Fayette took leave of\r\nthe Secretaries of State, the Treasury, and the Navy, and the guests who\r\nhad accompanied him from Washington, together with many military and naval\r\nofficers and eminent citizens who had assembled in various crafts near the\r\nfrigate to bid him farewell. The weather had been boisterous and rainy,\r\nbut just as the affecting scene had closed, the sun burst forth to cheer a\r\nspectacle which will long be remembered, and formed a magnificent arch,\r\nreaching from shore to shore--the barque which was to bear the venerable\r\nchief being immediately in the centre. Propitious omen! Heaven smiles on\r\nthe good deeds of men! And if ever there was a sublime and virtuous action\r\nto be blessed by heaven and admired by men, it is when a free and grateful\r\npeople unite to do honor to their friend and benefactor![Footnote:\r\nNational Intelligencer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON--THEIR CORRESPONDENCE--THEIR DEATH--MR.\r\nWEBSTER'S EULOGY--JOHN Q. ADAMS VISITS QUINCY--HIS SPEECH AT THE PUBLIC\r\nSCHOOL DINNER IN FANEUIL HALL.\r\n\r\nThe patriarchs John Adams and Thomas Jefferson still lingered on the\r\nshores of time. The former had attained the good old age of 90 years, and\r\nthe latter 82. Mrs. Adams, the venerable companion of the ex-President,\r\ndied in Quincy, on the 28th of Oct., 1818, aged 74 years. Although, amid\r\nthe various political strifes through which they had passed during the\r\nhalf century they had taken prominent parts in the affairs of their\r\ncountry, Adams and Jefferson had frequently been arrayed in opposite\r\nparties, and cherished many views quite dissimilar, yet their private\r\nfriendship and deep attachment had been unbroken. It continued to be\r\ncherished with generous warmth to the end of their days. This pleasing\r\nfact, together with the wonderful vigor of their minds in extreme old age,\r\nis proved by the following interesting correspondence between them, which\r\ntook place four years before their decease:--\r\n\r\n  MR. JEFFERSON TO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                            \"Monticello, June 1, 1822.\r\n\"It is very long, my dear sir, since I have written to you. My dislocated\r\nwrist is now become so stiff, that I write slowly, and with pain; and\r\ntherefore write as little as I can. Yet it is due to mutual friendship, to\r\nask once in a while how we do? The papers tell us that General Starke is\r\noff, at the age of ninety-three. ***** still lives at about the same age,\r\ncheerful, slender as a grasshopper, and so much without memory, that he\r\nscarcely recognizes the members of his household. An intimate friend of\r\nhis called on him, not long since. It was difficult to make him recollect\r\nwho he was, and sitting one hour, he told him the same story four times\r\nover. Is this life?--with laboring step\r\n\r\n  'To tread our former footsteps? pace the round\r\n  Eternal?--to beat and beat\r\n  The beaten track--to see what we have seen\r\n  To taste the tasted--o'er our palates to decant\r\n  Another vintage?'\r\n\r\n\"It is, at most, but the life of a cabbage, surely not worth a wish. When\r\nall our faculties have left, or are leaving us, one by one, sight,\r\nhearing, memory, every avenue of pleasing sensation is closed, and\r\nathumy, debility, and malaise left in their places, when the friends of\r\nour youth are all gone, and a generation is risen around us whom we know\r\nnot, is death an evil?\r\n\r\n  'When one by one our ties are torn,\r\n  And friend from friend is snatch'd forlorn;\r\n  When man is left alone to mourn,\r\n    Oh, then, how sweet it is to die!\r\n\r\n  'When trembling limbs refuse their weight,\r\n  And films slow gathering dim the sight;\r\n  When clouds obscure the mental light,\r\n  'Tis nature's kindest boon to die!'\r\n\r\n\"I really think so. I have ever dreaded a doting old age; and my health\r\nhas been generally so good, and is now so good, that I dread it still. The\r\nrapid decline of my strength during the last winter, has made me hope\r\nsometimes, that I see land. During summer, I enjoy its temperature, but I\r\nshudder at the approach of winter, and wish I could sleep through it, with\r\nthe dormouse, and only wake with him in spring, if ever. They say that\r\nStarke could walk about his room. I am told you walk well and firmly. I\r\ncan only reach my garden, and that with sensible fatigue. I ride, however,\r\ndaily; but reading is my delight. I should wish never to put pen to paper;\r\nand the more because of the treacherous practice some people have, of\r\npublishing one's letters without leave. Lord Mansfield declared it a\r\nbreach of trust, and punishable at law. I think it should be a\r\npenitentiary felony; yet you will have seen that they have drawn me out\r\ninto the arena of the newspapers. Although I know it is too late for me to\r\nbuckle on the armor of youth, yet my indignation would not permit me\r\npassively to receive the kick of an ass.\r\n\r\n\"To return to the news of the day, it seems that the cannibals of Europe\r\nare going to eat one another again. A war between Russia and Turkey is\r\nlike the battle of the kite and snake; whichever destroys the other,\r\nleaves a destroyer the less for the world. This pugnacious humor of\r\nmankind seems to be the law of his nature; one of the obstacles to too\r\ngreat multiplication, provided in the mechanism of the universe. The cocks\r\nof the hen-yard kill one another; bears, bulls, rams, do the same, and the\r\nhorse in his wild state kills all the young males, until, worn down with\r\nage and war, some vigorous youth kills him. * * * * * * I hope we shall\r\nprove how much happier for man the Quaker policy is, and that the life of\r\nthe feeder is better than that of the fighter. And it is some consolation\r\nthat the desolation by these maniacs of one part of the earth is the means\r\nof improving it in other parts. Let the latter be our office; and let us\r\nmilk the cow while the Russian holds her by the horns, and the Turk by the\r\ntail. God bless you, and give you health, strength, good spirits, and as\r\nmuch of life as you think worth having.\r\n                                                    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\"\r\n\r\n  MR. ADAMS' REPLY.\r\n                                               \"Quincy, June 11, 1822.\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--Half an hour ago I received, and this moment have heard read,\r\nfor the third or fourth time, the best letter that ever was written by an\r\noctogenarian, dated June 1st.\r\n\r\n  * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I have not sprained my wrist; but both my arms and hands are so\r\noverstrained that I cannot write a line. Poor Starke remembered nothing,\r\nand could talk of nothing but the battle of Bennington! ******** is not\r\nquite so reduced. I cannot mount my horse, but I can walk three miles over\r\na rugged, rocky mountain, and have done it within a month; yet I feel,\r\nwhen sitting in my chair, as if I could not rise out of it; and when\r\nrisen, as if I could not walk across the room. My sight is very dim,\r\nhearing pretty good, memory poor enough.\r\n\r\n\"I answer your question,--Is death an evil? It is not an evil. It is a\r\nblessing to the individual and to the world; yet we ought not to wish for\r\nit, till life becomes insupportable. We must wait the pleasure and\r\nconvenience of the 'Great Teacher.' Winter is as terrible to me as to you.\r\nI am almost reduced in it to the life of a bear or a torpid swallow. I\r\ncannot read, but my delight is to hear others read; and I tax all my\r\nfriends most unmercifully and tyrannically against their consent.\r\n\r\n\"The ass has kicked in vain; all men say the dull animal has missed the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\"This globe is a theatre of war; its inhabitants are all heroes. The\r\nlittle eels in vinegar, and the animalcules in pepper-water, I believe,\r\nare quarrelsome. The bees are as warlike as the Romans, Russians, Britons,\r\nor Frenchmen. Ants, caterpillars, and canker-worms are the only tribes\r\namong whom I have not seen battles; and Heaven itself, if we believe\r\nHindoos, Jews, Christians, and Mahometans, has not always been at peace.\r\nWe need not trouble ourselves about these things, nor fret ourselves\r\nbecause of evil doers; but safely trust the 'Ruler with his skies.' Nor\r\nneed we dread the approach of dotage; let it come if it must. ******, it\r\nseems, still delights in his four stories; and Starke remembered to the\r\nlast his Bennington, and exulted in his glory; the worst of the evil is,\r\nthat our friends will suffer more by our imbecility than we ourselves.\r\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\"In wishing for your health and happiness, I am very selfish; for I hope\r\nfor more letters. This is worth more than five hundred dollars to me; for\r\nit has already given me, and will continue to give me, more pleasure than\r\na thousand. Mr. Jay, who is about your age, I am told, experiences more\r\ndecay than you do.\r\n                            \"I am your old friend,\r\n                                                   \"JOHN ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nThis correspondence excited attention in Europe. The editor of the London\r\nMorning Chronicle prefaces it with the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"What a contrast the following correspondence of the two rival Presidents\r\nof the greatest Republic of the world, reflecting an old age dedicated to\r\nvirtue, temperance, and philosophy, presents to the heart-sickening\r\ndetails, occasionally disclosed to us, of the miserable beings who fill\r\nthe thrones of the continent. There is not, perhaps, one sovereign of the\r\ncontinent, who in any sense of the word can be said to honor our nature,\r\nwhile many make us almost ashamed of it. The curtain is seldom drawn aside\r\nwithout exhibiting to us beings worn out with vicious indulgence, diseased\r\nin mind, if not in body, the creatures of caprice and insensibility. On\r\nthe other hand, since the foundation of the American Republic, the chair\r\nhas never been filled by a man, for whose life (to say the least,) any\r\nAmerican need once to blush. It must, therefore, be some compensation to\r\nthe Americans for the absence of pure monarchy, that when they look\r\nupwards their eyes are not always met by vice, and meannesss, and often\r\nidiocy.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams joined his fellow-citizens of Quincy, Mass., in celebrating the\r\n4th of July, 1823, at the age of 88 years. Being called upon for a toast,\r\nhe gave the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The excellent President, Governor, Ambassador, and Chief Justice, JOHN\r\nJAY, whose name, by accident, was not subscribed on the DECLARATION OF\r\nINDEPENDENCE, as it ought to have been, for he was one of its ablest and\r\nfaithfullest supporters.--A splendid star just setting below the\r\nhorizon.\" It would be difficult (said the Boston Patriot,) fully to\r\ndescribe the delicate manner in which this toast was received and noticed\r\nby the company. Instead of loud acclamations, which succeeded the other\r\ntoasts, it was followed by soft and interrupted interjections and\r\naspirations, as if each individual was casting up an ejaculatory prayer,\r\nthat the two illustrious sages might pass the remainder of their days in\r\ntranquillity and ease, and finally be landed on the blissful shores of a\r\nhappy eternity.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1825, President Adams, with his family, left Washington, on\r\na visit to his venerable father, at Quincy. He travelled without\r\nostentation, and especially requested that no public display might be\r\nmanifested. At Philadelphia, Mrs. Adams was taken ill, and the President\r\nwas compelled to proceed without her. This visit was of short duration.\r\nCalled back to Washington by public affairs, he left Quincy on the 14th of\r\nOctober. It was his last interview on earth with his venerated parent. The\r\naged patriarch had lived to see his country emancipated from foreign\r\nthraldom, its independence acknowledged, its union consummated, its\r\nprosperity and perpetuity resting on an immovable foundation, and his son\r\nelevated to the highest office in its gift. It was enough! His work\r\naccomplished--the book of his eventful life written and sealed for\r\nimmortality--he was ready to depart and be at peace.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of July, 1826, will long be memorable for one of the most\r\nremarkable coincidences that has ever taken place in the history of\r\nnations. It was the fiftieth anniversary--the \"JUBILEE\"--of American\r\nindependence! Preparations had been made throughout the Union, to\r\ncelebrate the day with unusual pomp and display.  John Adams and Thomas\r\nJefferson had both been invited to participate in the festivities of the\r\noccasion, at their several places of abode. But a higher summons awaited\r\nthem! they were bidden to a \"jubilee\" above, which shall have no end! On\r\nthat half-century anniversary of American Independence, at nearly the same\r\nhour of the day, the spirits of Adams and Jefferson took their departure\r\nfrom earth!! Amid the rejoicings of the people, the peals of artillery,\r\nthe strains of music, the exultations of a great nation in the enjoyment\r\nof freedom, peace, and happiness, they were released from the toils of\r\nlife, and allowed to enter on their rest.\r\n\r\nThe one virtually the mover, the other the framer, of the immortal\r\nDeclaration of Independence--they had together shared the dangers and the\r\nhonors of the revolution--had served their country in various important\r\nand responsible capacities--had both received the highest honors in the\r\ngift of their fellow-citizens--had lived to see the nation to which they\r\nassisted in giving birth assume a proud stand among the nations of the\r\nearth--her free institutions framed, consolidated, tried, and matured--her\r\ncommerce hovering over all seas--respected abroad, united, prosperous,\r\nhappy at home--what more had earth in store for them? Together they had\r\ncounselled--together they had dared the power of a proud and powerful\r\nGovernment--together they had toiled to build up a great and prosperous\r\npeople--together they rejoiced in the success with which a wise and good\r\nProvidence had crowned their labors--and together, on their country's\r\nnatal day, amid the loud-swelling acclamations of the \"national jubilee,\"\r\ntheir freed spirits soared to light and glory above!\r\n\r\nThe venerable ex-President Adams had been failing for several days before\r\nthe 4th of July. In reply to an invitation from a committee of the\r\ncitizens of Quincy, to unite with them in celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of American independence, he had written a note, from which\r\nthe following is an extract:--\r\n\r\n\"The present feeble state of my health will not permit me to indulge the\r\nhope of participating with more than my best wishes, in the joys, and\r\nfestivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be\r\ncompleted the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the\r\nUnited States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined\r\nin future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to\r\nthe use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall,\r\nin time to come, be shaped by the human mind.\"\r\n\r\nBeing solicited for a toast, to accompany the letter, he\r\ngave--\"INDEPENDENCE FOREVER!!\" He was asked if anything should be added to\r\nit. Immediately he replied--\"Not a word!\" This toast was drank at the\r\ncelebration in Quincy, about fifty minutes before the departure of the\r\nvenerated statesman from earth.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th, which was ushered in by the ringing of bells\r\nand firing of cannon, he was asked if he knew what day it was?--\"O yes,\"\r\nhe replied, \"it is the glorious fourth of July--God bless it!--God bless\r\nyou all!!\" In the course of the day he said, \"It is a great and glorious\r\nday.\" The last words he uttered were, \"Jefferson survives!\" But the spirit\r\nof Jefferson had already left the body, and was hovering over the earth,\r\nto accompany his to higher and brighter scenes of existence!!\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson had been sensible for some days, that his last hour was at\r\nhand. He conversed with his family and friends, with the utmost composure,\r\nof his departure, and gave directions concerning his coffin and his\r\nfuneral. He was desirous that the latter should take place at Monticello,\r\nand that it should be without any display or parade. On Monday he inquired\r\nthe day of the month? Being told it was the 3d of July, he expressed an\r\nearnest desire that he might be allowed to behold the light of the next\r\nday--the fiftieth anniversary of American independence. His prayer was\r\nheard and answered. He beheld the rising of that sun on the morning of the\r\n4th, which was to set on a nation mourning the loss of two of its noblest\r\nbenefactors, and its brightest ornaments. He was cheerful to the last. A\r\nday or two previous, being in great pain, he said to his physician--\"Well,\r\ndoctor, a few hours more, and the struggle will be over.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the last day, as the physician entered his apartment, he\r\nsaid, \"You see, doctor, I am here yet.\" On a member of his family\r\nexpressing an opinion that he was better, he replied, with evident\r\nimpatience--\"Do not imagine for a moment that I feel the smallest\r\nsolicitude as to the result.\" Some individual present uttering a hope that\r\nhe might recover, he asked with a smile--\"Do you think I fear to die?\"\r\nThus departed Thomas Jefferson. His last words were--\"I resign my soul to\r\nmy God, and my daughter to my country!\"\r\n\r\nPresident J. Q. Adams receiving intelligence at Washington of the illness\r\nof his father, started immediately for Quincy. Shortly before arriving at\r\nBaltimore, tidings reached him that the patriarch had gone to his rest.\r\nMr. Adams pursued his journey, but did not arrive at Quincy in season to\r\nbe present at the funeral. This took place on the 7th of July. It was\r\nattended by a large body of citizens, assembled from the surrounding\r\nregion. The funeral services took place at the Unitarian church in Quincy,\r\non which occasion an impressive discourse was delivered by the Pastor,\r\nRev. Mr. Whitney. The pall-bearers were Judge Davis, President Kirkland,\r\nGov. Lincoln, Hon. Mr. Greenleaf, Judge Story, and Lieut. Gov. Winthrop.\r\nDuring the exercises and the moving of the procession, minute guns were\r\nfired from Mount Wallaston, and from various eminences in the adjoining\r\ntowns, and every mark of respect was paid to the remains of one who filled\r\nso high a place in the history of his country and the regard of his\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of August, Mr. Webster delivered a eulogy on the death of Adams\r\nand Jefferson, before the city authorities of Boston, and a vast body of\r\npeople, in Faneuil Hall. President Adams was present. It was one of Mr.\r\nWebster's most eloquent and successful attempts. He commenced as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"This is an unaccustomed spectacle. For the first time, fellow-citizens,\r\nbadges of mourning shroud the columns and overhang the arches of this\r\nhall. These walls, which were consecrated, so long ago, to the cause of\r\nAmerican liberty, which witnessed her infant struggles and rung with the\r\nshouts of her earliest victories, proclaim now, that distinguished friends\r\nand champions of that great cause have fallen. It is right that it should\r\nbe thus. The tears which flow, and the honors that are paid, when the\r\nFounders of the Republic die, give hope that the Republic itself may be\r\nimmortal. It is fit, that by public assembly and solemn observance, by\r\nanthem and by eulogy, we commemorate the services of national benefactors,\r\nextol their virtues, and render thanks to God for eminent blessings, early\r\ngiven and long continued to our favored country.\r\n\r\n\"ADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more; and we are assembled, fellow-citizens,\r\nthe aged, the middle-aged and the young, by the spontaneous impulse of\r\nall, under the authority of the municipal government, with the presence of\r\nthe chief magistrate of the commonwealth, and others of its official\r\nrepresentatives, the university, and the learned societies, to bear our\r\npart in these manifestations of respect and gratitude, which universally\r\npervade the land. ADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more. On our fiftieth\r\nanniversary, the great national jubilee, in the very hour of public\r\nrejoicing, in the midst of echoing and re-echoing voices of thanksgiving,\r\nwhile their own names were on all tongues, they took their flight together\r\nto the world of spirits.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Mr. Webster's eulogy was equally impressive:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens: I will detain you no longer by this faint and feeble\r\ntribute to the illustrious dead. Even in other hands, adequate justice\r\ncould not be performed, within the limits of this occasion. Their highest,\r\ntheir best praise, is your deep conviction of their merits, your\r\naffectionate gratitude for their labors and services. It is not my voice,\r\nit is this cessation of ordinary pursuits, this arresting of all\r\nattention, those solemn ceremonies, and this crowded house, which speak\r\ntheir eulogy. Their fame, indeed, is safe. That is now treasured up,\r\nbeyond the reach of accident. Although no sculptured marble should rise to\r\ntheir memory, nor engraved stone bear record to their deeds, yet will\r\ntheir remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored. Marble columns\r\nmay, indeed, moulder into dust, time may erase all impress from the\r\ncrumbling stone, but their fame remains; for with American liberty it\r\nrose, and with American liberty only can it perish. It was the last\r\nswelling peal of yonder choir--'THEIR BODIES ARE BURIED IN PEACE, BUT\r\nTHEIR NAME LIVETH EVERMORE!' I catch that solemn song, I echo that lofty\r\nstrain of funeral triumph! 'Their name liveth evermore.'\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute against the sun, that\r\nwith America, and in America, a new era commences in human affairs. This\r\nera is distinguished by free representative governments, by entire\r\nreligious liberty, by improved systems of national intercourse, by a\r\nnewly-awakened and an unconquerable spirit of free inquiry, and by a\r\ndiffusion of knowledge through the community, such as has been before\r\naltogether unknown and unheard of. America, America, our country,\r\nfellow-citizens, our own dear and native land, is inseparably connected,\r\nfast bound up, in fortune and by fate, with these great interests. If they\r\nfall, we fall with them; if they stand, it will be because we have\r\nupholden them. Let us contemplate, then, this connection, which binds the\r\nprosperity of others to our own; and let us manfully discharge all the\r\nduties which it imposes. If we cherish the virtues and the principles of\r\nour fathers, heaven will assist us to carry on the work of human liberty,\r\nand human happiness. Auspicious omens cheer us: great examples are before\r\nus: our own firmament now shines brightly upon our path: WASHINGTON is in\r\nthe clear upper sky. These other stars have now joined the American\r\nconstellation; they circle around their centre, and the heavens beam with\r\na new light. Beneath this illumination, let us walk the course of life,\r\nand at its close devoutly commend our beloved country, the common parent\r\nof us all, to the Divine Benignity.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this visit at the East, at this time, President J. Q. Adams\r\nattended the annual examination of the public schools in Boston, and was\r\npresent at the public dinner given in Faneuil Hall, to the school\r\ncommittee, teachers, and most meritorious scholars. In reply to a\r\ncomplimentary toast from the Mayor, Mr. Adams responded as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"MR. MAYOR, AND MY FELLOW-CITIZENS OF BOSTON:--A few days since, we were\r\nassembled in this Hall, as the house of mourning--in commemoration of the\r\ntwo last survivors of that day which had proclaimed at once our\r\nindependence and our existence as a nation. We are now assembled within\r\nthe same walls, at the house of feasting--at the festival of fathers\r\nrejoicing in the progressive improvement of their children.\r\n\r\n\"We have been told by the wisest man of antiquity, that it is better to go\r\nto the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting. How emphatically\r\ntrue would that sentence be, if the house of mourning were always such as\r\nthis hall but so recently exhibited!--a mourning of gratitude--a mourning\r\nof faithful affection--a mourning full of consolation and joy. And yet,\r\ncould the wisest of men now look down upon this happy meeting--of parents\r\npartaking together of the bounties of Providence, in mutual gratulation\r\nwith each other at the advances of their offspring in moral and\r\nintellectual cultivation--would he, could he, my friends, have said that\r\nit is better to go to the house of mourning than to such a house of\r\nfeasting?\r\n\r\n\"For is not the spirit of that solemnity, and of this, effectively the\r\nsame? If that was the commemoration of the good deeds of your forefathers,\r\nmay not this be called the commemoration of the future achievements of\r\nyour sons? If that day was dedicated to the blessed memory of the past, is\r\nnot this devoted to the no less blessed hope of the future? It was from\r\nschools of public instruction, instituted by our forefathers, that the\r\nlight burst forth. It was in the primary schools; it was by the midnight\r\nlamps of Harvard hall, that were conceived and matured, as it was within\r\nthese hallowed walls that were first resounded the accents of that\r\nindependence which is now canonized in the memory of those by whom it was\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Was it not there that were formed, to say nothing of him 'fit for the\r\npraise of any tongue but mine,'--but was it not there that were formed,\r\nand prepared for the conflicts of the mind, for the intellectual warfare\r\nwhich distinguishes your Revolution from all the brutal butcheries of\r\nvulgar war, your James Otis, your John Hancock, your Samuel Adams, your\r\nRobert Treat Paine, your Elbridge Gerry, your James and your Joseph\r\nWarren, and last, not least, your Josiah Quincy, so worthily represented\r\nby your Chief Magistrate here at my side?\r\n\r\n\"Indulge me, fellow-citizens, with the remark, that I have been called to\r\nanswer to myself these questions, before I could enjoy the happiness, at\r\nthe very kind invitation of your Mayor and Aldermen, of presenting myself\r\namong you this day.\r\n\r\n\"In conformity to my own inclinations, and to the usages of society, I\r\nhave deemed it proper, on the recent bereavement I have sustained, to\r\nwithdraw for a time from the festive intercourse of the world, and in\r\nretirement, so far as may be consistent with the discharge of public\r\ntrusts, to prepare for and perform the additional duties devolving upon\r\nme, as a son, and as a parent, from this visitation of heaven. To that\r\nretirement I have hitherto been confined; and in departing from it for a\r\nsingle day, I have needed an apology to myself, as I trust I shall need\r\none to you. Seek for it, my fellow-citizens in your own paternal hearts. I\r\nhave been unable to resist the invitation of the authorities of this my\r\nown almost native city, to mingle with her inhabitants in the joyous\r\nfestivities of this occasion--and, after witnessing, in the visitation of\r\nthe schools, hundreds and thousands of the rising generation training 'up\r\nin the way they should go;' to come here and behold the distinguished\r\nproficients of the schools sharing at the social board the pleasures of\r\ntheir fathers, and to congratulate the fathers on the growing virtues and\r\nbrightening talents of their children.\r\n\r\n\"But, fellow-citizens, I will no longer trespass upon your indulgence. I\r\nthank you for the sentiment with which you have honored me. I thank you\r\nfor the many affecting testimonials of kindness and sympathy which I have\r\nso often received at your hands; and will give you as a token of my good\r\nwishes, not yourselves, but objects dearer to your hearts. Mr. Mayor, I\r\npropose to you for a toast--\r\n\r\n\"The blooming youth of Boston--May the maturity of the fruit be equal to\r\nthe promise of the blossom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS'S ADMINISTRATION--REFUSES TO REMOVE POLITICAL OPPOSERS FROM\r\nOFFICE--URGES THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS--APPOINTS\r\nCOMMISSIONERS TO THE CONGRESS OF PANAMA--HIS POLICY TOWARD THE INDIAN\r\nTRIBES--HIS SPEECH ON BREAKING GROUND FOR THE CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO\r\nCANAL--BITTER OPPOSITION TO HIS ADMINISTRATION--FAILS OF RE-ELECTION TO\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY--RETIRES FROM OFFICE.\r\n\r\nIn administering the Government of the United States, Mr. Adams adhered\r\nwith rigid fidelity to the principles embodied in his inaugural speech.\r\nBelieving that \"the will of the people is the source, and the happiness of\r\nthe people the end, of all legitimate government on earth,\" it was his\r\nconstant aim to act up to this patriotic principle in the discharge of his\r\nduties as chief magistrate. He was emphatically the President of the\r\nentire people, and not of a section, or a party. His administration was\r\ntruly national in its scope, its objects, and its results. His views of\r\nthe sacred nature of the trust imposed upon him by his fellow-citizens\r\nwere too exalted to allow him to desecrate the power with which it clothed\r\nhim to the promotion of party or personal interests. Although not\r\nunmindful of the party which elevated him to the presidency, nor forgetful\r\nof the claims of those who yielded sympathy and support to the measures of\r\nhis administration, yet in all his doings in this respect, his primary aim\r\nwas the general good. Simply a friendship for him, or his measures,\r\nwithout other and requisite qualifications, would not ensure from Mr.\r\nAdams an appointment to office. Neither did an opposition to his\r\nadministration alone, except there was a marked practical unfitness for\r\noffice, ever induce him to remove an individual from a public station.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the administration of Mr. Adams from the present day, and\r\ncomparing it with those which have succeeded it, or even those which\r\npreceded it, the acknowledgment must be made by all candid minds, that it\r\nwill lose nothing in purity, patriotism, and fidelity, in the discharge of\r\nall its trusts. He was utterly incapable of proscription for opinion's\r\nsake. With a stern integrity worthy the highest admiration, and which the\r\npeople at that period were far too slow to acknowledge and appreciate, he\r\nwould not displace his most active political opponents from public\r\nstations he found them occupying, provided they were competent to their\r\nduty and faithful in the discharge of the same. \"It was in my hearing\r\nthat, to a representation that a certain important and influential\r\nfunctionary of the General Government in New York was using the power of\r\nhis office adversely to Mr. Adams's re-election, and that he ought to\r\ndesist or be removed, Mr. Adams made this reply:--'That gentleman is one\r\nof the best officers in the public service. I have had occasion to know\r\nhis diligence, exactness, and punctuality. On public grounds, therefore,\r\nthere is no cause of complaint against him, and upon no other will I\r\nremove him. If I cannot administer the Government on these principles, I\r\nam content to go back to Quincy!'\" [Footnote: King's Eulogy on John Quincy\r\nAdams.] Being in Baltimore on a certain occasion, among those introduced\r\nto him was a gentleman who accosted him thus--\"Mr. President, though I\r\ndiffer from you in opinion, I am glad to find you in good health.\" The\r\nPresident gave him a hearty shake of the hand, and replied,--\"Sir, in our\r\nhappy and free country, we can differ in opinion without being enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes illustrate the character and principles of Mr. Adams. He\r\nknew nothing of the jealousy and bitterness which are gendered, in little\r\nminds and hearts, by disparities of sentiment. Freedom of opinion he\r\nconsidered the birthright of every American citizen, and he would in no\r\ninstance be the instrument of inflicting punishment upon the head of any\r\nman on account of its exercise. High and pure in all his aims, he sought\r\nto reach them by means of a corresponding character. If he could not\r\nsucceed in the use of such instruments, he was content to meet defeat. The\r\nrule by which he was governed in the discharge of his official duties, is\r\nbeautifully expressed by the dramatic bard:--\r\n\r\n                         \"Be just and fear not.\r\nLet all the ends thou aim'st at, be thy COUNTRY'S,\r\nThy GOD'S, and TRUTH'S. Then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,\r\nThou fall'st a blessed martyr!\"\r\n\r\nIn the truly republican position which Mr. Adams took in regard to\r\nappointments to office, and which, it is humiliating to believe, was one\r\nmeans of his subsequent defeat, he but faithfully imitated the example of\r\n\"the Father of his country.\" When Gen. Washington occupied the\r\npresidential chair, application was made for the appointment of one of his\r\nold and intimate friends to a lucrative office. At the same time a\r\npetition was received asking the same station for a most determined\r\npolitical opponent. The latter received the appointment. The friend was\r\ngreatly disappointed and hurt in his feelings at his defeat. Let the\r\nexplanation of Washington be noted and ever remembered:--\"My friend,\" said\r\nhe, \"I receive with cordial welcome. He is welcome to my house, and\r\nwelcome to my heart; but with all his good qualities he is not a man of\r\nbusiness. His opponent, with all his politics so hostile to me, is a man\r\nof business. My private feelings have nothing to do in the case. I am not\r\nGeorge Washington, but President of the United States. As George\r\nWashington, I would do this man any kindness in my power--as President of\r\nthe United States, I can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe period of Mr. Adams's administration, was not one which admitted of\r\nacts calculated to rivet the attention, or excite the admiration and\r\napplause of the multitude. No crisis occurred in national affairs--no\r\nimminent peril from without, or danger within, threatened the well-being\r\nof the country! Quietness reigned throughout the world, and the nations\r\nwere allowed once more to cultivate the arts of peace, to enlarge the\r\noperations of commerce, and to fix their attention on domestic\r\ninterests--the only true fountain of national prosperity. But though\r\nlacking in some of the more striking elements of popularity, the\r\nadministration of Mr. Adams was preeminently useful in all its measures\r\nand influences. During no Presidential term since the organization of the\r\nGovernment, has more been done to consolidate the Union, and develop its\r\nresources, and lay the foundations of national strength and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe two great interests which, perhaps, received the largest share of\r\nattention from Mr. Adams' administration, were internal improvements and\r\ndomestic manufactures. A special attention to these subjects was\r\nrecommended in his messages to Congress. And throughout his term, he\r\nfailed not to urge these vital matters upon the attention of the people,\r\nand their representatives. He recommended the opening of national roads\r\nand canals--the improvement of the navigation of rivers, and the safety of\r\nharbors--the survey of our coasts, the erection of light houses, piers,\r\nand breakwaters. Whatever tended to facilitate communication and\r\ntransportation between extreme portions of the Union--to bring the people\r\nof distant sections into a more direct intercourse with each other, and\r\nbind them together by ties of a business, social and friendly nature--to\r\npromote enterprize, industry, and enlarged views of national and\r\nindividual prosperity--obtained his earnest sanction and recommendation.\r\nTo encourage home labor--to protect our infant manufactories from a fatal\r\ncompetition with foreign pauper wages--to foster and build up in the bosom\r\nof the country a system of domestic production, which should not only\r\nsupply home consumption, and afford a home market for raw materials and\r\nprovisions, the produce of our own soil, but enable us in due time to\r\ncompete with other nations in sending our manufactures to foreign\r\nmarkets--he yielded all his influence to the levying of protective duties\r\non foreign articles, especially such as could be produced in our own\r\ncountry. The wisdom of this policy, its direct tendency to promote\r\nnational wealth and strength, and to render the Union truly independent of\r\nthe fluctuations and vicissitudes of foreign countries, cannot be doubted,\r\nit would seem, by those possessing clear minds and sound judgment, of all\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nUnder the faithful supervision of one so vigilant as Mr. Adams, the\r\nforeign relations of the Government could not have been neglected. The\r\nintimate knowledge of the condition of foreign nations, their resources\r\nand their wants, which was possessed by himself and by Mr. Clay, the\r\nSecretary of State, afforded facilities in this department, from which the\r\ncountry reaped the richest benefit. During the four years of his\r\nadministration, more treaties were negotiated at Washington than during\r\nthe entire thirty-six years through which the preceding administrations\r\nhad extended. New treaties of amity, navigation and commerce, were\r\nconcluded with Austria, Sweden, Denmark, the Hanseatic League, Prussia,\r\nColombia, and Central America. Commercial difficulties and various\r\narrangements of a satisfactory character, were settled with the\r\nNetherlands, and other European Governments. The claims of our citizens\r\nagainst Sweden, Denmark and Brazil, for spoilations of commerce, were\r\nsatisfactorily consummated.\r\n\r\n\"As time advances, the evidences are accumulating on all sides, that the\r\nadministration of John Quincy Adams was one of the most wise, patriotic,\r\npacific, just, and wealth-producing, in the history of the country; and no\r\nsmall part of that benefit may justly be ascribed to the aid he received\r\nfrom his Secretary of State. Mr. Adams himself was a great statesman, bred\r\nin the school of statesmen, and all his life exercised in the business of\r\nstate, with recognized skill, and approved fidelity. The seven years\r\nimmediately preceding the administration of Mr. Adams, was a period of\r\ngreat commercial embarrassment and distress; and the seven years\r\nsubsequent to his entrance on the duties of chief executive, was a period\r\nof great public and private prosperity.\" [Footnote: Cotton's Life of\r\nClay.]\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Adams was thus seeking to foster and encourage the industrial\r\nand monetary interests of the country, he was not forgetful of the\r\nimportant claims of literature and science. President Washington, during\r\nhis administration, had repeatedly urged on Congress the importance of\r\nestablishing a national university at the capital; and he had located and\r\nbequeathed a site for that purpose. But his appeals on this subject had\r\nbeen in vain. In Mr. Adams's first message, he earnestly called on\r\nCongress to carry into execution this recommendation of the Father of his\r\nCountry--insisting that \"among the first, perhaps the very first\r\ninstrument for the improvement of the condition of men, is knowledge; and\r\nto the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapted to the wants, the\r\ncomforts, and the enjoyments of human life, public institutions and\r\nseminaries of learning are essential.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same message Mr. Adams recommended the establishment of a national\r\nobservatory. \"Connected with the establishment of an university,\" he said\r\n\"or, separate from it, might be undertaken the erection of an astronomical\r\nobservatory, with provision for the support of an astronomer, to be in\r\nconstant attendance of observation upon the phenomena of the heavens, and\r\nfor the periodical publication of his observations. It is with no feeling\r\nof pride, as an American, that the remark may be made, that, on the\r\ncomparatively small territorial surface of Europe, there are existing\r\nupwards of one hundred and thirty of these light-houses in the skies;\r\nwhile, throughout the whole American hemisphere, there is not one. If we\r\nreflect a moment upon the discoveries which, in the last four centuries,\r\nhave been made in the physical constitution of the universe, by the means\r\nof these buildings, and of observers stationed in them, shall we doubt of\r\ntheir usefulness to every nation? And while scarcely a year passes over\r\nour heads without bringing some new astronomical discovery to light, which\r\nwe must fain receive at second hand from Europe, are we not cutting\r\nourselves off from the means of returning light for light, while we have\r\nneither observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe, and the earth\r\nrevolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?\"\r\n\r\nIt is humiliating to reflect that neither of these recommendations\r\nreceived an encouraging response from Congress. The latter suggestion,\r\nindeed, excited the ridicule of many of the opposers of Mr. Adams, and \"a\r\nlight-house in the skies,\" became a term of reproach in their midst. In\r\nthis, however, it must be confessed, their ridicule was greatly at the\r\nexpense of their intelligence, their public spirit, and their devotion to\r\nthe highest interests of man. There are few reflections more mortifying to\r\nan American citizen, than that while so large a portion of the resources\r\nof the national Government have been exhausted in prosecuting party\r\nmeasures, rewarding partisan services, and promoting sectional and\r\npersonal schemes, little or nothing has been devoted to the encouragement\r\nof the arts and sciences, and the cultivation of those higher walks of\r\nhuman attainment which exalt and refine a people, and fit them for the\r\npurest and sweetest enjoyments of life.\r\n\r\nIt was during the first year of his administration, that the attention of\r\nMr. Adams was called to a proposed Congress of all the Republics on the\r\nAmerican Continent, to meet at Panama. The objects designed to be\r\naccomplished by such a Congress have been variously stated. It has been\r\nbelieved by some to have been called for the purpose of opposing a\r\nsupposed project, entertained by the Allied Powers of Europe, of combining\r\nfor the purpose of reducing the American Republics to their former\r\ncondition of European vassalage. Be this as it may, the Panama Congress,\r\namong its objects, aimed at the cementing of the friendly relations of all\r\nthe independent States of America, and the forming of a kind of mutual\r\ncouncil, to act as an umpire to settle the differences which might arise\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe United States was invited to send representatives to Panama. Mr.\r\nAdams, as President, in view of the beneficial influences which in various\r\nways might flow from such a meeting, accepted the invitation, with the\r\nunderstanding that the Government of the United States would take no part\r\nthat could conflict with its neutral position, in the wars which might\r\nthen be in existence between any of the South American Republics and other\r\npowers. The acceptance of this invitation was announced by Mr. Adams in\r\nhis first message to Congress. This was immediately followed by the\r\nnomination of Messrs. Richard C. Anderson and John Sargeant, as\r\ncommissioners to the Congress of Panama, and Wm. B. Rochester, of New\r\nYork, as secretary of the commission. These nominations were confirmed by\r\nthe Senate; and an appropriation was voted by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, after strong opposition and much delay, to carry the\r\ncontemplated measure into effect.\r\n\r\nBut the United States Government was never represented in the Panama\r\nCongress. The proceedings in the House of Representatives on this subject\r\nhad been so protracted, that it was found too late for Mr. Sargeant to\r\nreach Panama in season for the meeting of the Congress, which took place\r\non the 22nd of June, 1826. Mr. Anderson, who was then minister at\r\nColombia, on receiving his instructions, commenced his journey to Panama;\r\nbut on reaching Carthagena he was seized with a malignant fever, which\r\nterminated his existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the second session of the nineteenth Congress, the subject of\r\ncommercial intercourse with the British West India Colonies was thoroughly\r\ndiscussed. The British Parliament had laid restrictions so onerous on the\r\ntrade of the United States with these Colonies, that it could be pursued\r\nto very little profit. Bills were introduced into both houses of Congress,\r\nfor the protection of the interests of American merchants, trading with\r\nthe British Colonies; but the Senate and House failing to agree on the\r\ndetails of the proposed measures, nothing was done to effect the desired\r\nobject. Congress having adjourned without passing any law to meet the\r\nrestrictive measures of Great Britain, President Adams, on the 17th of\r\nMarch, 1827, agreeably to a law passed three years before, issued a\r\nproclamation closing the ports of the United States against vessels from\r\nthe British colonies, until the restrictive measures of the British\r\nGovernment should be repealed.\r\n\r\nThe policy pursued by Mr. Adams toward the Indian tribes within the United\r\nStates, was pacific and humane. The position they held toward the General\r\nGovernment was of an unsettled and embarrassing character. Enjoying a\r\nspecies of independence, and subject to laws of their own enactment, they\r\nwere, nevertheless, dependent on the Government of the United States for\r\nprotection, and were, in fact, wholly at its disposal. Near the close of\r\nMr. Monroe's administration, in a message to Congress, on the 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1825, he proposed a plan to remove the tribes scattered through\r\nthe several States, to a tract of country west of the Mississippi, and to\r\nunite them in one nation, with some plan for their government and\r\ncivilization. This proposition meeting with a decided opposition on the\r\npart of many of the Indians, was modified during Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration. It finally resulted in a plan of removing west of the\r\nMississippi such individuals among the various tribes as would consent to\r\ngo under the inducements held out; and allowing the remainder to continue\r\nin their old abode, occupying each a small tract of land. This policy has\r\nsince been pursued by the General Government, and has resulted in the\r\nremoval of most of the aborigines beyond the western shores of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nThese removals, however, have been attended with no little difficulty, and\r\nat times have led to collisions which have assumed a serious aspect. An\r\ninstance of this description occurred during the first year Mr. Adams\r\noccupied the presidential chair. In 1802, a compact was formed between the\r\nGeneral Government and the State of Georgia, in which it was agreed, that\r\nin consequence of the relinquishment, on the part of Georgia, of all her\r\nclaim to the land set off in the then new Mississippi Territory, the\r\nGeneral Government, at its own expense, should obtain a relinquishment,\r\nfrom the Creek Indians, of all their lands within the State of Georgia,\r\n\"whenever it could be peaceably done upon reasonable terms.\"\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this agreement, the United States had extinguished the\r\nIndian title to about fifteen millions of acres of land. At the close of\r\nMr. Monroe's administration, over nine millions of acres were still\r\nretained by the Indians. The State authorities of Georgia became very\r\nanxious to obtain possession of this also. At the solicitation of Gov.\r\nTroup, President Madison sent two Commissioners to make a treaty with the\r\nCreeks, for the purchase of their lands, and the removal of the Indians\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. But the Creeks, having begun to appreciate and\r\nenjoy the comforts of civilization, and the advantages of the arts and\r\nsciences, which had been introduced into their midst, refused to treat on\r\nthe subject, and passed a law in the General Council of their nation,\r\nforbidding, on pain of death, the sale of any of their lands. After the\r\nclose of the council, a few of the Creeks, influenced by a chief named\r\nM'Intosh, met the United States Commissioners, and formed a treaty on\r\ntheir own responsibility, ceding to the General Government all the Creek\r\nlands in Georgia and Alabama. When intelligence of this treaty was\r\ncirculated among the Indians, they were filled with indignation. Their\r\nGeneral Council met--resolved not to sanction a treaty obtained in a\r\nmanner so dishonorable and illegal--and despatched a party of Indians to\r\nthe residence of M'Intosh, who immediately shot him and another chief who\r\nhad signed the treaty with him.\r\n\r\nThis surreptitious treaty was transmitted to Washington, and under a\r\nmisapprehension of the manner in which it was secured, was ratified by the\r\nSenate, on the 3d of March, 1825, the last day of Mr. Monroe's\r\nadministration. Gov. Troup, acting under this treaty, sent surveyors into\r\nthe Creek Territory, to lay out the land in lots, which were to be\r\ndistributed among the white inhabitants of Georgia, by lottery. The\r\nIndians resisted this encroachment, and prepared to defend their rights by\r\nphysical force--at the same time sending to Washington for protection from\r\nthe General Government. The authorities of Georgia insisted upon a survey,\r\nand ordered out a body of militia to enforce it.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of this state of affairs, President Adams despatched a special\r\nagent to inquire into the facts of the case. After due investigation, the\r\nagent reported that the treaty had been obtained by bad faith and\r\ncorruption, and that the Creeks were almost unanimously opposed to the\r\ncession of their lands. On receiving this report, the President determined\r\nto prevent the survey ordered by the Governor of Georgia, until the matter\r\ncould be submitted to Congress, and ordered Gen. Gaines to proceed to the\r\nCreek country with a body of United States troops, to prevent collision\r\nbetween the Indians and the Georgia forces.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February, Mr. Adams transmitted a message to Congress,\r\ngiving a statement of these transactions, and declaring his determination\r\nto fulfil the duty of protection the nation owed the Creeks, as guaranteed\r\nby treaty, by all the force at his command. \"That the arm of military\r\nforce,\" he continued, \"will be resorted to only in the event of the\r\nfailure of all other expedients provided by the laws, a pledge has been\r\ngiven by the forbearance to employ it at this time. It is submitted to the\r\nwisdom of Congress to determine whether any further acts of legislation\r\nmay be necessary or expedient to meet the emergency which these\r\ntransactions may produce.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee of the House of Representatives, to which this message was\r\nreferred, reported that it \"is expedient to procure a cession of the\r\nIndian lands in the State of Georgia, and that until such a cession is\r\nprocured, the law of the land, as set forth in the treaty at Washington,\r\nought to be maintained by all necessary, constitutional, and legal means.\"\r\nThe firmness and decision of President Adams undoubtedly prevented the\r\nunhappy consequences of a collision between the people of Georgia and the\r\nCreek Indians. A new negotiation was opened with the Indians, by direction\r\nof the President, which resulted in declaring the M'Intosh treaty null and\r\nvoid, and in obtaining, at length, a cession of all the lands of the\r\nCreeks within the limits of Georgia, to the General Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the friend and promoter of internal improvements, Mr. Adams was invited\r\nto be present at the interesting ceremony of \"breaking ground,\" on the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio canal, then about to be commenced, which took place on\r\nthe 4th of July, 1828. On the morning of that day, the President, the\r\nHeads of Departments, the Foreign Ministers, the Corporations of\r\nWashington, Georgetown, and Alexandria, the President and Directors of the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, with a large concourse of citizens,\r\nembarked on board of steamboats and ascended the Potomac, to the place\r\nselected for the ceremony. On reaching the ground, a procession was\r\nformed, which moved around it so as to leave a hollow space, in the midst\r\nof a mass of people, in the centre of which was the spot marked out by\r\nJudge Wright, the Engineer of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, for\r\nthe commencement of the work. A moment's pause here occurred, while the\r\nspade, destined to commence the work, was selected by the committee of\r\narrangements, and the spot for breaking ground was precisely denoted.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sun shone out from behind a cloud, giving an appearance\r\nof the highest animation to the scene. Amidst an intense silence, the\r\nMayor of Georgetown handed to Gen. Mercer, the President of the Canal\r\nCompany, the consecrated instrument; which, having received, he stepped\r\nforward from the resting column, and addressed as follows the listening\r\nmultitude:--\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens: There are moments in the progress of time which are the\r\ncounters of whole ages. There are events, the monuments of which,\r\nsurviving every other memorial of human existence, eternize the nation to\r\nwhose history they belong, after all other vestiges of its glory have\r\ndisappeared from the globe. At such a moment have we now arrived. Such a\r\nmonument we are now to found.\"\r\n\r\nTurning towards the President of the United States, who stood near him,\r\nMr. M. proceeded:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: On a day hallowed by the fondest recollections, beneath\r\nthis cheering (may we not humbly trust auspicious) sky, surrounded by the\r\nmany thousand spectators who look on us with joyous anticipation; in the\r\npresence of the representatives of the most polished nations of the old\r\nand new worlds; on a spot where little more than a century ago the painted\r\nsavage held his nightly orgies; at the request of the three cities of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, I present to the Chief Magistrate of the most\r\npowerful Republic on earth, for the most noble purpose that was ever\r\nconceived by man, this humble instrument of rural labor, a symbol of the\r\nfavorite occupation of our countrymen. May the use to which it is about to\r\nbe devoted prove the precursor, to our beloved country, of improved\r\nagriculture, of multiplied and diversified arts, of extended commerce and\r\nnavigation. Combining its social and moral influence with the principles\r\nof that happy constitution under which you have been called to preside\r\nover the American people, may it become a safeguard of their liberty and\r\nindependence, and a bond of perpetual union!\r\n\r\n\"To the ardent wishes of this vast assembly I unite my fervent prayer to\r\nthat infinite and awful Being without whose favor all human power is but\r\nvanity, that he will crown your labor with his blessing, and our work with\r\nimmortality.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had ended, the President of the United States, to whom Gen.\r\nMercer had presented the spade, stepped forward, and, with an animation of\r\nmanner and countenance which showed that his whole heart was in the thing,\r\nthus addressed the assembly of his fellow-citizens:--\r\n\r\n\"Friends and Fellow-citizens: It is nearly a full century since Berkely,\r\nbishop of Cloyne, turning towards this fair land which we now inhabit,\r\nthe eyes of a prophet, closed a few lines of poetical inspiration with\r\nthis memorable prediction--\r\n\r\n    \"Time's noblest empire is the last :\"--\r\n\r\na prediction which, to those of us whose lot has been cast by Divine\r\nProvidence in these regions, contains not only a precious promise, but a\r\nsolemn injunction of duty, since upon our energies, and upon those of our\r\nposterity, its fulfilment will depend. For with reference to what\r\nprinciple could it be that Berkely proclaimed this, the last, to be the\r\nnoblest empire of time? It was, as he himself declares, on the\r\ntransplantation of learning and the arts to America. Of learning and the\r\narts. The four first acts--the empires of the old world, and of former\r\nages--the Assyrian, the Persian, the Grecian, the Roman empires--were\r\nempires of conquest, dominions of man over man. The empire which his great\r\nmind, piercing into the darkness of futurity, foretold in America, was the\r\nempire of learning and the arts,--the dominion of man over himself, and\r\nover physical nature--acquired by the inspirations of genius, and the\r\ntoils of industry; not watered with the tears of the widow and the orphan;\r\nnot cemented in the blood of human victims; founded not in discord, but in\r\nharmony,--of which the only spoils are the imperfections of nature, and\r\nthe victory achieved is the improvement of the condition of all. Well may\r\nthis be termed nobler than the empire of conquest, in which man subdues\r\nonly his fellow-man.\r\n\r\n\"To the accomplishment of this prophecy, the first necessary step was the\r\nacquisition of the right of self-government, by the people of the British\r\nNorth American Colonies, achieved by the Declaration of Independence, and\r\nits acknowledgment by the British nation. The second was the union of all\r\nthese colonies under one general confederated Government--a task more\r\narduous than that of the preceding separation, but at last effected by the\r\npresent constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The third step, more arduous still than either or both the others, was\r\nthat which we, fellow-citizens, may now congratulate ourselves, our\r\ncountry, and the world of man, that it is taken. It is the adaptation of\r\nthe powers, physical, moral, and intellectual, of this whole Union, to the\r\nimprovement of its own condition: of its moral and political condition, by\r\nwise and liberal institutions--by the cultivation of the understanding and\r\nthe heart--by academies, schools, and learned institutes--by the pursuit\r\nand patronage of learning and the arts; of its physical condition, by\r\nassociated labor to improve the bounties, and to supply the deficiencies\r\nof nature; to stem the torrent in its course; to level the mountain with\r\nthe plain; to disarm and fetter the raging surge of the ocean.\r\nUndertakings of which the language I now hold is no exaggerated\r\ndescription, have become happily familiar not only to the conceptions, but\r\nto the enterprize of our countrymen. That for the commencement of which\r\nwe are here assembled is eminent among the number. The project\r\ncontemplates a conquest over physical nature, such as has never yet been\r\nachieved by man. The wonders of the ancient world, the pyramids of Egypt,\r\nthe Colossus of Rhodes, the temple at Ephesus, the mausoleum of\r\nArtemisia, the wall of China, sink into insignificance before\r\nit:--insignificance in the mass and momentum of human labor required for\r\nthe execution--insignificance in comparison of the purposes to be\r\naccomplished by the work when executed. It is, therefore, a pleasing\r\ncontemplation to those sanguine and patriotic spirits who have so long\r\nlooked with hope to the completion of this undertaking, that it unites the\r\nmoral power and resources--first, of numerous individuals--secondly, of\r\nthe corporate cities of Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria--thirdly,\r\nof the great and powerful States of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and\r\nMaryland--and lastly, by the subscription authorized at the recent session\r\nof Congress, of the whole Union.\r\n\r\n\"Friends and Fellow-laborers. We are informed by the holy oracles of\r\ntruth, that, at the creation of man, male and female, the Lord of the\r\nuniverse, their Maker, blessed them, and said unto them, be fruitful, and\r\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it. To subdue the earth was,\r\ntherefore, one of the first duties assigned to man at his creation; and\r\nnow, in his fallen condition, it remains among the most excellent of his\r\noccupations. To subdue the earth is pre-eminently the purpose of the\r\nundertaking, to the accomplishment of which the first stroke of the spade\r\nis now to be struck. That it is to be struck by this hand, I invite you to\r\nwitness.--[Here the stroke of the spade.] [Footnote: Attending this action\r\nwas an incident which produced a greater sensation than, any other that\r\noccurred during the day. The spade which the President held, struck a\r\nroot, which prevented its penetrating the, earth. Not deterred by trifling\r\nobstacles from doing what he had deliberately resolved to perform, Mr.\r\nAdams tried it again, with no better success. Thus foiled, he threw down\r\nthe spade, hastily stripped off and laid aside his coat, and went\r\nseriously to work. The multitude around, and on the hills and trees, who\r\ncould not hear, because of their distance from the open space, but could\r\nsee and understand, observing this action, raised a loud and unanimous\r\ncheering, which continued for some time after Mr. Adams had mastered the\r\ndifficulty.] And in performing this act, I call upon you to join me in\r\nfervent supplication to Him from whom that primitive injunction came, that\r\nhe would follow with his blessing, this joint effort of our great\r\ncommunity, to perform his will in the subjugation of the earth for the\r\nimprovement of the condition of man--that he would make it one of his\r\nchosen instruments for the preservation, prosperity, and perpetuity of our\r\nUnion--that he would have in his holy keeping all the workmen by whose\r\nlabors it is to be completed--that their lives and their health may be\r\nprecious in his sight; and that they may live to see the work of their\r\nhands contribute to the comforts and enjoyments of millions of their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\"Friends and brethren: Permit me further to say, that I deem the duty, now\r\nperformed at the request of the President and Directors of the Chesapeake\r\nand Ohio Canal Company, and the Corporations of the District of Columbia,\r\none of the most fortunate incidents of my life. Though not among the\r\nfunctions of my official station, I esteem it as a privilege conferred\r\nupon me by my fellow-citizens of the District. Called, in the performance\r\nof my service, heretofore as one of the representatives of my native\r\ncommonwealth in the Senate, and now as a member of the executive\r\ndepartment of the Government, my abode has been among the inhabitants of\r\nthe District longer than at any other spot upon earth. In availing myself\r\nof this occasion to return to them my thanks for the numberless acts of\r\nkindness that I have experienced at their hands, may I be allowed to\r\nassign it as a motive, operating upon the heart, and superadded to my\r\nofficial obligations, for taking a deeper interest in their welfare and\r\nprosperity. Among the prospects of futurity which we may indulge the\r\nrational hope of seeing realized by this junction of distant waters, that\r\nof the auspicious influence which it will exercise over the fortunes of\r\nevery portion of this District is one upon which my mind dwells with\r\nunqualified pleasure. It is my earnest prayer that they may not be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\"It was observed that the first step towards the accomplishment of the\r\nglorious destinies of our country was the Declaration of Independence.\r\nThat the second was the union of these States under our federative\r\nGovernment. The third is irrevocably fixed by the act upon the\r\ncommencement of which we are now engaged. What time more suitable for this\r\noperation could have been selected than the anniversary of our great\r\nnational festival? What place more appropriate from whence to proceed,\r\nthan that which bears the name of the citizen warrior who led our armies\r\nin that eventful contest to the field, and who first presided as the Chief\r\nMagistrate of our Union? You know that of this very undertaking he was one\r\nof the first projectors; and if in the world of spirits the affections of\r\nour mortal existence still retain their sway, may we not, without\r\npresumption, imagine that he looks down with complacency and delight upon\r\nthe scene before and around us?\r\n\r\n\"But while indulging in a sentiment of joyous exultation at the benefits\r\nto be derived from this labor of our friends and neighbors, let us not\r\nforget that the spirit of internal improvement is catholic and liberal. We\r\nhope and believe that its practical advantages will be extended to every\r\nindividual in our Union. In praying for the blessing of heaven upon our\r\ntask, we ask it with equal zeal and sincerity upon every other similar\r\nwork in this confederacy; and particularly upon that which, on this same\r\nday, and perhaps at this very hour, is commencing from a neighboring city.\r\nIt is one of the happiest characteristics in the principle of internal\r\nimprovement, that the success of one great enterprise, instead of\r\ncounteracting, gives assistance to the execution of another. May they\r\nincrease and multiply, till, in the sublime language of inspiration, every\r\nvalley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low; the\r\ncrooked straight, the rough places plain. Thus shall the prediction of the\r\nbishop of Cloyne be converted from prophecy into history; and, in the\r\nvirtues and fortunes of our posterity, the last shall prove the noblest\r\nempire of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe administration of Mr. Adams, from the first day of its existence, met\r\nwith an opposition more determined, bitter, and unscrupulous than any\r\nwhich has ever assailed a President of the United States. It evidently was\r\nnot an opposition based on well-grounded objections to his principles or\r\nhis measures Before an opportunity had been given fairly and fully to\r\ndevelop his policy as President, the opposition had taken its stand, and\r\nboldly declared that his administration should be overthrown at every\r\nhazard, whatever might be its policy, its integrity, or its success. A\r\nfavorite candidate, having certain elements of immense popularity with a\r\nlarge class of people, and supported with enthusiasm by his immediate\r\nfriends, had been defeated in the previous presidential canvass, at a\r\nmoment when it was thought triumphant success had been secured. Under the\r\nexasperation and excitement of this overthrow, it was determined that his\r\nmore fortunate rival should be displaced at the earliest moment, at\r\nwhatever cost, though his administration should prove unrivalled in\r\npatriotism, and the successful promotion of the general welfare.\r\n\r\nThe opposition did not fail to seize upon certain points, which, in the\r\nexercise of a due degree of adroitness, yielded an ample material for\r\npopular declamation and censure. The fact that Mr. Adams had a less number\r\nof electoral votes than Gen. Jackson was greatly dwelt upon as positive\r\nevidence that the will of the people had been violated in the election of\r\nthe former to the presidency--although it has since been satisfactorily\r\nascertained that Mr. Adams had a larger number of the primary votes of the\r\npeople than his prominent opponent.\r\n\r\nThe charge of \"bargain and corruption,\" alleged against Mr. Adams and Mr.\r\nClay, was also used as an effective weapon against the former, in the\r\nsuceeeding presidential canvass.  Notwithstanding the charge had been\r\npromptly and emphatically denied by the parties implicated, and proof in\r\nits support fearlessly challenged--notwithstanding every attempt at\r\nevidence to fix it upon them had most signally failed, and involved those\r\nengaged therein in utter confusion of face--yet so often and so boldly was\r\nthe charge repeated by designing men, so generally and continually was it\r\nreiterated by a venal press from one end of the Union to the other, that a\r\nmajority of the people was driven into its belief, and the fate of Mr.\r\nAdams's administration was sealed against him. Subsequent developments\r\nhave shown, that, in the annals of political warfare, there never was a\r\ncharge uttered against eminent public men, so thoroughly destitute of the\r\nshadow of truth as this. But it answered the immediate ends of its\r\nauthors. Posterity will do ample justice to all the parties in this\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nAnother event which operated seriously to the disadvantage of Mr. Adams,\r\nwas the amalgamation of the strong Crawford party with the supporters of\r\nGen. Jackson. This combination threw obstacles in the way of the\r\nadministration which were insurmountable. It enabled the opposition to\r\nsend a majority of members to the twentieth Congress, both in the Senate\r\nand the House of Representatives. The test of the strength of parties in\r\nthe House took place on the election of Speaker. Andrew Stevenson, of\r\nVirginia, was elected on the first ballot, by a majority of ten votes over\r\nJohn W. Taylor, the administration candidate. Mr. Stevenson was a\r\nsupporter of Mr. Crawford in 1824. His election to the Speaker's chair\r\nclearly indicated the union of the different sections of the opposition,\r\nand foreshadowed too evidently the overthrow of the administration of Mr.\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, with a majority of Congress against him, the\r\nPresident was deprived of the opportunity of carrying into execution many\r\nimportant measures which were highly calculated to promote the permanent\r\nbenefit of the country, and which could not have failed to receive the\r\napprobation of the people. A majority of all the committees of both Houses\r\nwere against him; and for the first time an administration was found\r\nwithout adequate strength in Congress to support its measures. In several\r\ninstances the reports of committees partook of a strong partisan\r\ncharacter, in violation of all rules of propriety and correct legislation.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the twentieth Congress, which was held immediately\r\npreceding the presidential campaign of 1828, was characterized by\r\nproceedings, which, at this day, all will unite in deciding as highly\r\nreprehensible. Instead of attending strictly to the legitimate business of\r\nthe session, much of the time was spent in discussions involving the\r\nmerits of the opposing candidates for the presidency, and designed to have\r\nan express bearing on the election then near at hand. Of this character\r\nwas a resolution introduced into the House of Representatives, on the 8th\r\nof January, 1828, by Mr. Hamilton, a supporter of Gen. Jackson, to inquire\r\ninto the expediency of having a historical picture of the battle of New\r\nOrleans painted, and placed in the rotunda of the Capitol. This was\r\nfollowed by a resolution, introduced by Mr. Sloane, an administration\r\nmember, requiring the Secretary of War to furnish the House with a copy of\r\nthe proceedings of a court-martial ordered by Gen. Jackson, in 1814, for\r\nthe trial of certain Tennessee militiamen, who were condemned and shot.\r\n\r\nAt this session of Congress may be dated the introduction of a practice\r\nwhich has become an evil of the greatest magnitude in the present day.\r\nReference is had to the custom of making the halls of Congress a mere\r\narena, where, instead of attending to the legitimate business of\r\nlegislating for the benefit of the country at large, political gladiators\r\nspend much of their time in wordy contests, designed solely for the\r\npromotion of personal or party purposes, to the neglect of the interests\r\nof their constituents. From this has grown the habit of speech-making by\r\nthe hour, on topics trivial in their nature, in which the people have not\r\nthe slightest interest, and which quite often, are totally foreign to the\r\nsubject ostensibly in debate. Valuable time and immense treasures are thus\r\nsquandered to no profitable purpose. Should not this evil be abated?\r\n\r\nThe stern integrity of Mr. Adams, and his unyielding devotion to\r\nprinciple, were made to operate against him. Had he chosen to turn the\r\nvast influence at his command to the promotion of personal ends--had he\r\nunscrupulously ejected from office all political opposers, and supplied\r\ntheir places with others who would have labored, with all the means at\r\ntheir disposal, in his behalf--little doubt can be entertained that he\r\ncould have secured his re-election. But he utterly refused to resort to\r\nsuch measures. Believing he was promoted to his high position not for his\r\nindividual benefit, but to advance the welfare of the entire country, his\r\nview of duty was too elevated and pure to allow him to desecrate the trust\r\nreposed in him to personal ends. Hence the influence derived from the\r\npatronage of the General Government was turned against the administration\r\nrather than in its behalf; and the singular spectacle was presented of men\r\nexerting every nerve to overthrow Mr. Adams, who were dependent upon him\r\nfor the influence they wielded against him, and for their very means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nA hotly contested political campaign ensued in the fall of 1828. In view\r\nof the peculiar combination of circumstances, and of the means resorted to\r\nby the opposing parties to secure success, the result could be foreseen\r\nwith much certainty. Gen. Jackson was elected President of the United\r\nStates, and was inaugurated on the 4th of March, 1829.\r\n\r\nThus closed the administration of John Quincy Adams. At the call of his\r\ncountry he entered upon the highest station in its gift. With a fidelity\r\nand uprightness which have not been surpassed, he discharged his important\r\ntrust to the lasting benefit of all the vital interests which tend to\r\nbuild up a great and prosperous people. And at the call of his country he\r\nrelinquished the honors of office, and willingly retired to the private\r\nwalks of life.\r\n\r\nNo man can doubt that Mr. Adams could look back upon his labors while\r\nPresident with the utmost satisfaction. \"During his administration new and\r\nincreased activity was imparted to those powers vested in the Federal\r\nGovernment for the development of the resources of the country, and the\r\npublic revenue was liberally expended in prosecuting those liberal\r\nmeasures, to which the sanction of Congress had been deliberately given,\r\nas the settled policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"More than one million of dollars had been expended in enlarging and\r\nmaintaining the light-house establishment--half a million in completing\r\nthe public buildings--two millions in erecting arsenals, barracks, and\r\nfurnishing the national armories--nearly the same amount had been expended\r\nin permanent additions to the naval establishment--upwards of three\r\nmillions had been devoted to fortifying the sea-coast--and more than four\r\nmillions expended in improving the internal communications between\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and in procuring information, by\r\nscientific surveys, concerning its capacity for further improvement.\r\nIndeed, more had been directly effected by the aid of Government in this\r\nrespect, during Mr. Adams' administration, than during the administrations\r\nof all his predecessors. Other sums, exceeding a million, had been\r\nappropriated for objects of a lasting character, and not belonging to the\r\nannual expense of the Government; making in the whole nearly fourteen\r\nmillions of dollars expended for the permanent benefit of the country,\r\nduring this administration.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time the interest on the public debt was punctually paid, and\r\nthe debt itself was in a constant course of reduction, having been\r\ndiminished $30,373,188 during his administration, and leaving due on the\r\n1st of January, 1829, $58,362,136. While these sums were devoted to\r\nincreasing the resources and improving the condition of the country, and\r\nin discharging its pecuniary obligations, those claims which were derived\r\nfrom what are termed the imperfect obligations of gratitude and humanity\r\nwere not forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"More than five millions of dollars were appropriated to solace the\r\ndeclining years of the surviving officers of the Revolution; and a million\r\nand a half expended in extinguishing the Indian title, and defraying the\r\nexpense of the removal beyond the Mississippi of such tribes as were\r\nunqualified for a residence near civilized communities, and in promoting\r\nthe civilization of those who, relying on the faith of the United States,\r\npreferred to remain on the lands which were the abodes of their fathers.\r\n\r\n\"In the condition which we have described--in peace with all the world,\r\nwith an increasing revenue, and with a surplus of $5,125,638 in the public\r\ntreasury,--the administration of the Government of the United States was\r\nsurrendered by Mr. Adams on the 3d of March, 1829.\" [Footnote: American\r\nAnnual Register.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Georgia Constitutionalist\" thus describes Mr. Adams' retirement from\r\noffice:--\"Mr. Adams is said to be to good health and spirits. The manner\r\nin which this gentleman retired from office is so replete with propriety\r\nand dignity, that we are sure history will record it as a laudable example\r\nto those who shall hereafter be required by the sovereign people to\r\ndescend from exalted stations. It was a great matter with the ancients to\r\ndie with decency, and there are some of our own day whose deaths are more\r\nadmirable than their lives. Mr. Adams' deportment in the Presidency was\r\nlofty and proud; but the smile with which he throws aside the trappings of\r\npower, and the graceful propriety with which he takes leave of patronage\r\nand place, are truly commendable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' MULTIPLIED ATTAINMENTS--VISITED BY SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN--HIS\r\nREPORT ON WEIGHTS AND MEASURES--HIS POETRY--ERECTS A MONUMENT TO THE\r\nMEMORY OF HIS PARENTS--ELECTED MEMBER OF CONGRESS--LETTER TO THE BIBLE\r\nSOCIETY--DELIVERS EULOGY ON DEATH OF EX-PRESIDENT MONROE.\r\n\r\nFew public men in any country have possessed attainments more varied than\r\nwere those of Mr. Adams. Every department of literature and science\r\nreceived more or less of his attention--every path of human improvement\r\nseems to have been explored by him. As a statesman, he was unrivalled in\r\nthe profundity of his knowledge. His state papers--given to the world\r\nwhile Minister, Secretary of State, President, and Member of Congress--his\r\nnumerous addresses, orations, and speeches, are astonishing in number, and\r\nin the learning they display. [Footnote: Aside from his state papers,\r\nofficial correspondence, and speeches, which would make many volumes, the\r\nLiterary World gives the following list of the published writings of Mr.\r\nAdams:--\r\n\"1. Oration at Boston, 1793; 2. Answer to Paine's Rights of Man, 1793; 3.\r\nAddress to the Members of the Massachusetts Charitable Fire Society; 4.\r\nLetters on Silesia; 5. Letters on Silesia, 1804; 6. Inaugural Oration\r\nat Harvard College, 1806; 7. Letters to H. G. Otis, in reply to Timothy\r\nPickering, 1808; 8. Review of the Works of Fisher Ames, 1809; 9. Lectures\r\non Rhetoric and Oratory, two volumes, 1810; 10. Report on Weights and\r\nMeasures, 1821; 11. Oration at Washington, 1821; 12. Duplicate Letters;\r\nthe Fisheries and the Mississippi, 1822; 13. Oration to the citizens of\r\nQuincy, 1831; 14. Oration on the Death of James Monroe, 1831; 15. Dermot\r\nMcMorrogh, or the Conquest of Ireland, 1832; 16. Letters to Edward\r\nLivingston, on Free Masonry, 1833; 17. Letters to William L. Stone, on the\r\nentered apprentice's oath, 1833; 18. Oration on the Life and Character of\r\nLafayette, l835; 19. Oration on the Life and Character of James Madison,\r\n1836; 20. The Characters of Shakspeare, 1837; 21. Oration delivered at\r\nNewburyport, 1837; 22. Letters to his Constituents of the Twelfth\r\nCongressional District of Massachusetts, 1837; 23. The Jubilee of the\r\nConstitution, 1839; 24. A Discourse on Education, delivered at Braintree,\r\n1840; 25. An Address at the Observatory, Cincinnati, 1843.\r\nAmong the unpublished works of Mr. Adams, besides his Diary, which extends\r\nover half a century, and would probably make some two dozen stout octavos,\r\nare Memoirs of the earlier Public and Private Life of John Adams, second\r\nPresident of the United States, in three volumes; Reports and Speeches on\r\nPublic Affairs; Poems including two new cantos of Dermot McMorrogh, a\r\nTranslation of Oberon and numerous Essays and Discourses.\"]\r\n\r\nNo man was more familiar with modern history, with diplomacy and\r\ninternational law, and the politics of America and Europe for the last two\r\nor three centuries.\r\n\r\nIn other departments he appeared equally at home. His acquaintance was\r\nfamiliar with the classics, and several modern languages. In oratory,\r\nrhetoric, and the various departments of belles lettres, his attainments\r\nwere of more than an ordinary character. His commentaries on Desdemona,\r\nand others of Shakspeare's characters, show that he was no mean critic,\r\nin the highest walks of literature, and in all that pertains to human\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of an interview with ex-President Adams,\r\nby a southern gentleman, in 1834, affords some just conceptions of the\r\nversatility of his genius, and the profoundness of his erudition:--\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, accompanied by my friend T., I paid a visit to the venerable\r\nex-President, at his residence in Quincy. A violent rain setting in as\r\nsoon as we arrived, gave us from five to nine o'clock to listen to the\r\nlearning of this man of books. His residence is a plain, very plain one:\r\nthe room into which we were ushered, (the drawing-room, I suppose,) was\r\nfurnished in true republican style. It is probably of ancient\r\nconstruction, as I perceived two beams projecting from the low ceiling, in\r\nthe manner of the beams in a ship's cabin. Prints commemorative of\r\npolitical events, and the old family portraits, hung about the room;\r\ncommon straw matting covered the floor, and two candlesticks, bearing\r\nsperm candles, ornamented the mantle-piece. The personal appearance of the\r\nex-President himself corresponds with the simplicity of his furniture. He\r\nresembles rather a substantial, well-fed farmer, than one who has wielded\r\nthe destinies of this mighty Confederation, and been bred in the ceremony\r\nand etiquette of an European Court. In fact, he appears to possess none\r\nof that sternness of character which you would suppose to belong to one a\r\nlarge part of whose life has been spent in political warfare, or, at any\r\nrate, amidst scenes requiring a vast deal of nerve and inflexibility.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Adams is described in a word--a lady. She has all the warmth of\r\nheart and ease of manner that mark the character of the southern ladies,\r\nand from which it would be no easy matter to distinguish her.\r\n\r\n\"The ex-President was the chief talker. He spoke with infinite ease,\r\ndrawing upon his vast resources with the certainty of one who has his\r\nlecture before him ready written. The whole of his conversation, which\r\nsteadily he maintained for nearly four hours, was a continued stream of\r\nlight. Well contented was I to be a listener. His subjects were the\r\narchitecture of the middle ages; the stained glass of that period;\r\nsculpture, embracing monuments particularly. On this subject his opinion\r\nof Mrs. Nightingale's monument in Westminster Abbey, differs from all\r\nothers that I have seen or heard. He places it above every other in the\r\nAbbey, and observed in relation to it, that the spectator 'saw nothing\r\nelse.' Milton, Shakspeare, Shenstone, Pope, Byron, and Southey were in\r\nturn remarked upon. He gave Pope a wonderfully high character, and\r\nremarked that one of his chief beauties was the skill exhibited in varying\r\nthe cesural pause--quoting from various parts of his author to illustrate\r\nhis remarks more fully. He said very little on the politics of the\r\ncountry. He spoke at considerable length of Sheridan and Burke, both of\r\nwhom he had heard, and could describe with the most graphic effect. He\r\nalso spoke of Junius; and it is remarkable that he should place him so\r\nfar above the best of his contemporaries. He spoke of him as a bad man;\r\nbut maintained, as a writer, that he had never been equalled.\r\n\r\n\"The conversation never flagged for a moment; and on the whole, I shall\r\nremember my visit to Quincy, as amongst the most instructive and pleasant\r\nI ever passed.\"\r\n\r\nAs a theologian, Mr. Adams was familiar with the tenets of the various\r\ndenominations which compose the great Christian family, and acquainted\r\nwith the principal arguments by which they support their peculiar views.\r\nWhile entertaining decided opinions of his own, which he did not hesitate\r\nto avow on all proper occasions, he was tolerant of the sentiments of all\r\nwho differed from him. He deemed it one of the most sacred rights of every\r\nAmerican citizen, and of every human being, to worship God according to\r\nthe dictates of his own conscience, without let or hindrance, our laws\r\nequally tolerating, and equally protecting every sect.\r\n\r\nIn the most abstruse sciences he was equally at home. His report to\r\nCongress, while Secretary of State, on Weights and Measures was very\r\nelaborate, and evinced a deep and careful research into this important but\r\nmost difficult subject. That report was of the utmost value. Adopting the\r\nphilosophical and unchangeable basis of the modern French system of\r\nmensuration, an arc of the meridian, it laid the foundation for the\r\naccurate manipulations and scientific calculations of the late Professor\r\nHassler, which have furnished an unerring standard of Weights and\r\nMeasures to the people of this country. In a very learned notice of\r\n\"Measures, Weights, and Money,\" by Col. Pasley, Royal Engineer, F. R. S.,\r\npublished in London, in 1834, he pays the following well-merited\r\ncompliment to Mr. Adams:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot pass over the labors of former writers, without acknowledging in\r\nparticular, the benefit which I have derived, whilst investigating the\r\nhistorical part of my subject, from a book printed at Washington, in 1821,\r\nas an official Report on Weights and Measures, made by a distinguished\r\nAmerican statesman, Mr. John Quincy Adams, to the Senate of the United\r\nStates, of which he was afterwards President. This author has thrown more\r\nlight into the history of our old English weights and measures, than all\r\nformer writers on the same subject. His views of historical facts, even\r\nwhere occasionally in opposition to the reports of our own Parliamentary\r\nCommittees, appear to me to be the most correct. For my own part, I\r\nconfess that I do not think I could have seen my way into the history of\r\nEnglish weights and measures, in the feudal ages, without his guidance.\"\r\n\r\nTo his other accomplishments Mr. Adams added that of a poet. His\r\npretensions in this department were humble, yet many of his productions,\r\nthrown off hastily, no doubt, during brief respites from severer labors,\r\npossess no little merit. A few specimens will not be uninteresting to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n  LIFE OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.   237\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas are from a hymn by Mr. Adams for the celebration of\r\nthe 4th of July, 1831, at Quincy, Mass.:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sing to the Lord a song of praise;\r\n     Assemble, ye who love his name;\r\n   Let congregated millions raise\r\n     Triumphant glory's loud acclaim.\r\n   From earth's remotest regions come;\r\n     Come, greet your Maker, and your King;\r\n   With harp, with timbrel, and with drum,\r\n     His praise let hill and valley sing.\r\n\r\n  *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n  \"Go forth in arms; Jehovah reigns;\r\n     Their graves let foul oppressors find;\r\n   Bind all their sceptred kings in chains;\r\n     Their peers with iron fetters bind.\r\n   Then to the Lord shall praise ascend;\r\n     Then all mankind, with one accord,\r\n   And freedom's voice, till time shall end,\r\n     In pealing anthems, praise the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe lines which follow were inscribed to the sundial under the window of\r\nthe hall of the House of Representatives, at Washington:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou silent herald of Time's silent flight!\r\n     Say, couldst thou speak, what warning voice were thine?\r\n     Shade, who canst only show how others shine!\r\n   Dark, sullen witness of resplendent light\r\n   In day's broad glare, and when the noontide bright\r\n     Of laughing fortune sheds the ray divine,\r\n     Thy ready favors cheer us--but decline\r\n   The clouds of morning and the gloom of night.\r\n   Yet are thy counsels faithful, just and wise;\r\n     They bid seize the moments as they pass--\r\n\r\n   Snatch the retrieveless sunbeam as it flies,\r\n     Nor lose one sand of life's revolving glass--\r\n   Aspiring still, with energy sublime,\r\n     By virtuous deeds to give eternity to Time.\"\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that lines more pure and beautiful can be found, than the\r\nfollowing on the death of children:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sure, to the mansions of the blest\r\n     When infant innocence ascends,\r\n   Some angel brighter than the rest\r\n     The spotless spirit's flight attends.\r\n\r\n  \"On wings of ecstacy they rise,\r\n    Beyond where worlds material roll,\r\n   Till some fair sister of the skies\r\n     Receives the unpolluted soul.\r\n\r\n  \"There at the Almighty Father's hand,\r\n     Nearest the throne of living light,\r\n   The choirs of infant seraphs stand,\r\n     And dazzling shine, where all are bright.\r\n\r\n  \"The inextinguishable beam,\r\n     With dust united at our birth,\r\n   Sheds a more dim, discolored gleam,\r\n     The more it lingers upon earth:\r\n\r\n  \"Closed is the dark abode of clay,\r\n     The stream of glory faintly burns,\r\n   Nor unobscured the lucid ray\r\n     To its own native fount returns:\r\n\r\n  \"But when the Lord of mortal breath\r\n     Decrees his bounty to resume,\r\n   And points the silent shaft of death,\r\n     Which speeds an infant to the tomb,\r\n\r\n  \"No passion fierce, no low desire,\r\n     Has quenched the radiance of the flame;\r\n   Back to its God the living fire\r\n     Returns, unsullied, as it came.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart which could turn aside from the stern conflicts of the political\r\nworld, and utter sentiments so chaste and tender, must have been the\r\nresidence of the   sweetest and noblest emotions of man.\r\n\r\nHaving taken final leave, as he believed, of the duties of public life,\r\nand retired to the beloved shades of Quincy, it was the desire and\r\nintention of Mr. Adams to devote the remainder of his days to the peaceful\r\npursuits of literature. It had long been his purpose, whenever opportunity\r\nshould offer, to write a history of the life and times of his venerated\r\nfather, \"the elder Adams.\" His heart was fixed on this design, and some\r\nintroductory labors had been commenced. But an overruling Providence had a\r\nwidely different work in preparation for him.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Adams had been permitted to follow the bent of his own feelings at\r\nthat time--if he had continued in the retirement he had so anxiously\r\nsought as a rest from the toils of half a century--the brightest page of\r\nhis wonderful history would have remained forever unwritten. He would have\r\nbeen remembered as a discreet and trusty diplomatist, an able statesman, a\r\nsuccessful politician, a capable President, and an honest and honorable\r\nman! This would, indeed, have been a measure of renown with which most men\r\nwould have been content, and which few of the most fortunate sons of earth\r\ncan ever attain. He was abundantly satisfied with it. He asked for nothing\r\nmore--he expected nothing more this side the grave. But it was not enough!\r\nFame was wreathing brighter garlands, a more worthy chaplet, for his brow.\r\nA higher, nobler task was before him, than any enterprize which had\r\nclaimed his attention. His long and distinguished career--his varied and\r\ninvaluable experience--had been but a preparation to enable him to enter\r\nupon the real work of life for which he was raised up.\r\n\r\nThe world did not yet know John Quincy Adams. Long as he had been before\r\nthe public, the mass had thus far failed to read him aright. Hitherto\r\ncircumstances had placed him in collision with aspiring men. He stood in\r\ntheir way to station and power. There was a motive to conceal his virtues\r\nand magnify his faults. He had never received from his opposers the\r\nsmallest share of credit really due to him for patriotism, self-devotion,\r\nand purity of purpose. Even his most devoted friends did not fully\r\nappreciate these qualities in him. During his long public service, he had\r\never been an object of hatred and vituperation to a class of minds utterly\r\nincapable of estimating his talents or comprehending his high principles\r\nof action. In the heat of political struggles, no abuse, no defamation,\r\nwere too great to heap upon him. Misrepresentation, duplicity, malignity,\r\ndid their worst. Did he utter a patriotic sentiment, it was charged to\r\nhypocrisy and political cunning. Did he do a noble deed, worthy to be\r\nrecorded in letters of gold--sacrificing party predilections and\r\nfriendship to support the interest of his country, and uphold the\r\nreputation and dignity of its Government--it was attributed to a wretched\r\npandering for the emoluments of office. Did he endeavor to exercise the\r\npowers entrusted to him as President in such a manner as to preserve peace\r\nat home and abroad, develop the internal resources of the nation, improve\r\nfacilities for transportation and travel, protect and encourage the\r\nindustry of the country, and in every department promote the permanent\r\nprosperity and welfare of the people--it was allowed to be nothing more\r\nthan the arts of an intriguer, seeking a re-election to the Presidency.\r\nYea, it was declared in advance, that, \"if his administration should be as\r\npure as the angels in heaven,\" it should be overthrown. Did he exhibit the\r\nplain simplicity of a true republican in his dress and manners, and\r\neconomy in all his expenditures, it was attributed to parsimony and\r\nmeanness! A majority of his countrymen had been deceived as to his\r\nprinciples and character, and sacrificed him politically on the altar of\r\nprejudice and party spirit.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life he had ever been a lover of man and of human\r\nfreedom--the best friend of his country--the most faithful among the\r\ndefenders of its institutions--a sincere republican, and a true man.  But\r\nblinded by political prejudice, a large portion of his fellow-citizens\r\nrefused the boon of credit for these qualities. It remained for another\r\nstage of his life, another field of display, to correct them of this\r\nerror, and to vindicate his character. It was requisite that he should\r\nstep down from his high position, disrobe himself of office, power and\r\npatronage, place himself beyond the reach of the remotest suspicion of a\r\ndesire for political preferment and emolument, to satisfy the world that\r\nJohn Quincy Adams had from the beginning, been a pure-hearted patriot, and\r\none of the noblest sons of the American Confederacy. His new career was to\r\nfurnish a luminous commentary on his past life, and to convince the most\r\nsceptical, of the justice of his claim to rank among the highest and best\r\nof American patriots. Placed beyond the reach of any gift of office from\r\nthe nation, with nothing to hope for, and nothing to fear in this respect,\r\nhe was to write his name in imperishable characters, so high on the\r\ntablets of his country's history and fame, as to be beyond the utmost\r\nreach of malignity or suspicion! The door which led to this closing act of\r\nhis dramatic life, was soon opened.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Quincy, one of the first things which received the\r\nattention of Mr. Adams, was the discharge of a filial duty towards his\r\ndeceased parents, in the erection of a monument to their memory. The elder\r\nAdams in his will, among other liberal bequests, had left a large legacy\r\nto aid in the erection of a new Unitarian church in Quincy. The edifice\r\nwas completed, and ex-President J. Q. Adams caused the monument to his\r\nfather and mother to be erected within the walls. It was a plain and\r\nsimple design, consisting of a tablet, having recessed pilasters at the\r\nsides, with a base moulding and cornice; the whole supported by trusses\r\nat the base. The material of which it was made was Italian marble; and the\r\nwhole was surmounted by a fine bust of John Adams, from the chisel of\r\nGreenough, the American artist, then at Rome. The inscription, one of the\r\nmost feeling, appropriate, and classical specimens extant, was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                 \"LIBERTATEM AMICITTAM FIDEM RETINEBIS.\r\n D. O.

Speculation was at fault.\r\nWould he accept or reject such a nomination? By a large class it was\r\ndeemed impossible that one who had occupied positions so elevated--who had\r\nreceived the highest honors the nation could bestow upon him--would\r\nconsent to serve the people of a single district, in a capacity so humble,\r\ncomparatively, as a Representative in Congress. Such a thing was totally\r\nunheard of. The people, however, of the Plymouth congressional district in\r\nwhich he resided, met and duly nominated him for the proposed office. All\r\ndoubts as to his acceptance of the nomination were speedily dispelled by\r\nthe appearance of a letter from Mr. Adams, in the Columbian Sentinel,\r\nOct., 15, 1830, in which he says:--\r\n\r\n\"If my fellow-citizens of the district should think proper to call for\r\nsuch services as it may be in my power to render them, by representing\r\nthem in the twenty-second Congress, I am not aware of any bound principle\r\nwhich would justify me in withholding them. To the manifestations of\r\nconfidence on the part of those portions of the people who, at two several\r\nmeetings, have seen fit to present my name for the suffrages of the\r\ndistrict, I am duly and deeply sensible.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time the election was held, and Mr. Adams was returned to Congress,\r\nby a vote nearly unanimous. From that time forward for seventeen years,\r\nand to the hour of his death, he occupied the post of Representative in\r\nCongress from the Plymouth district, in Massachusetts, with unswerving\r\nfidelity, and distinguished honor. There can be no doubt that many of the\r\nbest friends of Mr. Adams seriously questioned the propriety of his\r\nappearing as a Representative in the halls of Congress. It was a step\r\nnever before taken by an ex-President of the United States. They\r\napprehended it might be derogatory to his dignity, and injurious to his\r\nreputation and fame, to enter into the strifes, and take part in the\r\nlitigations and contentions which characterize the national House of\r\nRepresentatives. Moreover, they were fearful that in measuring himself, as\r\nhe necessarily must, in the decline of life, with younger men in the prime\r\nof their days, who were urged by the promptings of ambition to tax every\r\ncapacity of their nature, he might injure his well-earned reputation for\r\nstrength of intellect, eloquence and statesmanship. But these misgivings\r\nwere groundless. In the House of Representatives, as in all places where\r\nMr. Adams was associated with others, he arose immediately to the head of\r\nhis compeers. So far from suffering in his reputation, it was immeasurably\r\nadvanced during his long congressional career. New powers were\r\ndeveloped--new traits of character were manifested--new and repeated\r\ninstances of devotion to principle and the rights of man were made\r\nknown--which added a brighter lustre to his already widely-extended fame.\r\nHe exhibited a fund of knowledge so vast and profound--a familiarity so\r\nperfect with nearly every topic which claimed the attention of\r\nCongress--he could bring forth from his well-replenished storehouse of\r\nmemory so vast an array of facts, shedding light upon subjects deeply\r\nobscured to others--displayed such readiness and power in debate, pouring\r\nout streams of purest eloquence, or launching forth the most scathing\r\ndenunciations when he deemed them called for--that his most bitter\r\nopposers, while trembling before his sarcasm, and dreading his assaults,\r\ncould not but grant him the meed of their highest admiration. Well did he\r\ndeserve the title conferred upon him by general consent, of \"the Old Man\r\nEloquent!\"\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Adams followed the bent of his own inclinations--had he consulted\r\nsimply his personal ease and comfort--he would probably never have\r\nappeared again in public life. Having received the highest distinctions\r\nhis country could bestow upon him, blessed with an ample fortune, and\r\npossessing all the elements of domestic comfort, he would have passed the\r\nevening of his earthly sojourn in peaceful tranquillity, at the mansion of\r\nhis fathers in Quincy. But it was one of the sacred rules in this\r\ndistinguished statesman's life, to yield implicit obedience to the demands\r\nof duty. His immediate neighbors and fellow-citizens called him to their\r\nservice in the national councils. He was conscious of the possession of\r\ntalents, knowledge, experience, and all the qualifications which would\r\nenable him to become highly useful, not only in acting as the\r\nrepresentative of his direct constituents, but in promoting the welfare of\r\nour common country. This conviction once becoming fixed in his mind,\r\ndecided his course. He felt he had no choice left but to comply\r\nunhesitatingly with the demand which had been made upon his patriotism. In\r\nadopting this resolution--in consenting, after having been once at the\r\nhead of the National Government, to assume again the labors of public life\r\nin a subordinate station, wholly divested of power and patronage, urged by\r\nno influence but the claims of duty, governed by no motive but a simple\r\ndesire to serve his country and promote the well-being of his\r\nfellow-man--Mr. Adams presented a spectacle of moral sublimity unequalled\r\nin the annals of nations!\r\n\r\nFor many years Mr. Adams was a member, and one of the Vice Presidents, of\r\nthe American Bible Society. In reply to an invitation to attend its\r\nanniversary in 1830, he wrote the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Your letter of the 22d of March was duly received; and while\r\nregretting my inability to attend personally at the celebration of the\r\nanniversary of the institution, on the 13th of next month, I pray you,\r\nsir, to be assured of the gratification which I have experienced in\r\nlearning the success which has attended the benevolent exertions of the\r\nAmerican Bible Society.\r\n\r\n\"In the decease of Judge Washington, they have lost an able and valuable\r\nassociate, whose direct co-operation, not less than his laborious and\r\nexemplary life, contributed to promote the cause of the Redeemer. Yet not\r\nfor him, nor for themselves by the loss of him, are they called to sorrow\r\nas without hope; for lives like his shine but as purer and brighter lights\r\nin the world, after the lamp which fed them is extinct, than before.\r\n\r\n\"The distribution of Bibles, if the simplest, is not the least efficacious\r\nof the means of extending the blessings of the Gospel to the remotest\r\ncorners of the earth; for the Comforter is in the sacred volume: and among\r\nthe receivers of that million of copies distributed by the Society, who\r\nshall number the multitudes awakened thereby, with good will to man in\r\ntheir hearts, and with the song of the Lamb upon their lips\"\r\n\r\n\"The hope of a Christian is inseparable from his faith. Whoever believes\r\nin the divine inspiration of the holy Scriptures, must hope that the\r\nreligion of Jesus shall prevail throughout the earth. Never since the\r\nfoundation of the world have the prospects of mankind been more\r\nencouraging to that hope than they appear to be at the present time. And\r\nmay the associated distribution of the Bible proceed and prosper, till the\r\nLord shall have made 'bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;\r\nand all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.'\r\n\r\n\"With many respects to the Board of Managers, please to accept the good\r\nwishes of your friend and fellow-citizen,\r\n                                         \"JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1831, at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, the\r\nvenerable JAMES MONROE, fifth President of the United States, departed\r\nlife, aged 73 years. He died at the residence of his son-in-law, Samuel L.\r\nGouverneur Esq., in the city of New York. His decease had been for some\r\ndays expected; but life lingered until the anniversary of his country's\r\nindependence, when his spirit took its departure to a better world.\r\nThroughout the United States, honors were paid to his memory by hoisting\r\nof flags at half mast, the tolling of bells, firing of minute guns, the\r\npassing of resolutions, and delivery of eulogies. He was, emphatically, a\r\ngreat and good man, respected and beloved by the people of all parties,\r\nwithout exception. There are few instances in the history of the world, of\r\nmore remarkable coincidences than the death of three Presidents of the\r\nUnited States, who took most prominent parts in proclaiming and achieving\r\nthe independence of our country, on the anniversary of the day when the\r\ndeclaration of that independence was made to the world.  The noise of the\r\nfiring of cannon, in celebrating the day, caused the eyes of the dying\r\nMonroe to open inquiringly. When the occasion of these rejoicings was\r\ncommunicated to him, a look of intelligence indicated that he understood\r\nthe character of the day.\r\n\r\nAt this anniversary of our National Independence, Mr. Adams delivered an\r\noration before the citizens of Quincy. It was an able and eloquent\r\nproduction. The following were the concluding paragraphs. In reference to\r\nnullification, which was threatened by some of the Southern States, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"The event of a conflict in arms, between the Union and one of its\r\nmembers, whether terminating in victory or defeat, would be but an\r\nalternative of calamity to all. In the holy records of antiquity, we have\r\ntwo examples of a confederation ruptured by the severance of its members,\r\none of which resulted, after three desperate battles, in the extermination\r\nof the seceding tribe. And the victorious people, instead of exulting in\r\nshouts of triumph, came to the house of God, and abode there till even,\r\nbefore God; and lifted up their voices, and wept sore, and said,--O Lord\r\nGod of Israel why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be\r\nto-day one tribe lacking in Israel? The other was a successful example of\r\nresistance against tyrannical taxation, and severed forever the\r\nconfederacy, the fragments forming separate kingdoms; and from that day\r\ntheir history presents an unbroken series of disastrous' alliances, and\r\nexterminating wars--of assassinations, conspiracies, revolts, and\r\nrebellions, until both parts of the confederacy sunk into tributary\r\nservitude to the nations around them; till the countrymen of David and\r\nSolomon hung their harps upon the willows of Babylon, and were totally\r\nlost amidst the multitudes of the Chaldean and Assyrian monarchies, 'the\r\nmost despised portion of their slaves.'\r\n\r\n\"In these mournful memorials of their fate, we may behold the sure, too\r\nsure prognostication of our own, from the hour when force shall be\r\nsubstituted for deliberation, in the settlement of our constitutional\r\nquestions. This is the deplorable alternative--the extirpation of the\r\nseceding member, or the never-ceasing struggle of two rival confederacies,\r\nultimately bending the neck of both under the yoke of foreign domination,\r\nor the despotic sovereignty of a conqueror at home. May heaven avert the\r\nomen! The destinies, not only of our posterity, but of the human race, are\r\nat stake.\r\n\r\n\"Let no such melancholy forebodings intrude upon the festivities of this\r\nanniversary. Serene skies and balmy breezes are not congenial to the\r\nclimate of freedom. Progressive improvement in the condition of man, is\r\napparently the purpose of a superintending Providence. That purpose will\r\nnot be disappointed. In no delusion of national vanity, but with a feeling\r\nof profound gratitude to the God of our fathers, let us indulge in the\r\ncheering hope and belief, that our country and her people have been\r\nselected as instruments for preparing and maturing much of the good yet in\r\nreserve for the welfare and happiness of the human race. Much good has\r\nalready been effected by the solemn proclamation of our principles--much\r\nmore by the illustration of our example. The tempest which threatens\r\ndesolation may be destined only to purify the atmosphere. It is not in\r\ntranquil ease and enjoyment that the active energies of mankind are\r\ndisplayed. Toils and dangers are trials of the soul. Doomed to the first\r\nby his sentence at the fall, man by submission converts them into\r\npleasures. The last are, since the fall, the conditions of his existence.\r\nTo see them in advance, to guard against them by all the suggestions of\r\nprudence, to meet them with the composure of unyielding resistance, and to\r\nabide with firm resignation the final dispensation of Him who rules the\r\nball--these are the dictates of philosophy--these are the precepts of\r\nreligion--these are the principles and consolations of patriotism:--these\r\nremain when all is lost--and of these is composed the spirit of\r\nindependence--the spirit embodied in that beautiful personification of the\r\npoet, which may each of you, my countrymen, to the last hour of his life,\r\napply to himself,--\r\n\r\n  'Thy spirit, Independence, let me share,\r\n     Lord of the lion heart, and eagle eye!\r\n   Thy steps I follow, with my bosom bare,\r\n     Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.'\r\n\r\n\"In the course of nature, the voice which now addresses you must soon\r\ncease to be heard upon earth. Life and all which it inherits lose their\r\nvalue as it draws towards its close. But for most of you, my friends and\r\nneighbors, long and many years of futurity are yet in store. May they be\r\nyears of freedom--years of prosperity--years of happiness, ripening for\r\nimmortality! But, were the breath which now gives utterance to my feelings\r\nthe last vital air I should draw, my expiring words to you and your\r\nchildren should be, Independence and Union forever!\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks subsequent to the death of ex-President Monroe, Mr. Adams\r\ndelivered an interesting and able eulogy on his life and character, before\r\nthe public authorities of the city of Boston, in Faneuil Hall. In drawing\r\nto a conclusion, he used the following language:--\r\n\r\n\"Our country, by the bountiful dispensations of a gracious Heaven, is, and\r\nfor a series of years has been, blessed with profound peace. But when the\r\nfirst father of our race had exhibited before him, by the archangel sent\r\nto announce his doom, and to console him in his fall, the fortunes and\r\nmisfortunes of his descendants, he saw that the deepest of their miseries\r\nwould befall them while favored with all the blessings of peace; and in\r\nthe bitterness of his anguish he exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n                                               'Now I see\r\n              Peace to corrupt, no less than war to waste.'\r\n\r\n\"It is the very fervor of the noonday sun, in the cloudless atmosphere, of\r\na summer sky, which breeds\r\n\r\n                                'the sweeping whirlwind's sway,\r\n         That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey.'\r\n\r\n\"You have insured the gallant ship which ploughs the waves, freighted with\r\nyour lives and your children's fortunes, from the fury of the tempest\r\nabove, and from the treachery of the wave beneath. Beware of the danger\r\nagainst which you can alone insure your-selves--the latent defect of the\r\ngallant ship itself. Pass but a few short days, and forty years will have\r\nelapsed since the voice of him who addresses you, speaking to your fathers\r\nfrom this hallowed spot, gave for you, in the face of Heaven, the solemn\r\npledge, that if, in the course of your career on earth, emergencies should\r\narise, calling for the exercise of those energies and virtues which, in\r\ntimes of tranquillity and peace remain by the will of Heaven dormant in\r\nthe human bosom, you would prove yourselves not unworthy the sires who had\r\ntoiled, and fought, and bled, for the independence of the country. Nor has\r\nthat pledge been unredeemed. You have maintained through times of trial\r\nand danger the inheritance of freedom, of union, of independence\r\nbequeathed you by your forefathers. It remains for you only to transmit\r\nthe same peerless legacy, unimpaired, to your children of the next\r\nsucceeding age. To this end, let us join in humble supplication to the\r\nFounder of empires and the Creator of all worlds, that he would continue\r\nto your posterity the smiles which his favor has bestowed upon you; and,\r\nsince 'it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps,' that he would\r\nenlighten and lead the advancing generation in the way they should go.\r\nThat in all the perils, and all the mischances which may threaten or\r\nbefall our United Republic, in after times, he would raise up from among\r\nyour sons deliverers to enlighten her councils, to defend her freedom, and\r\nif need be, to lead her armies to victory. And should the gloom of the\r\nyear of independence ever again overspread the sky, or the metropolis of\r\nyour empire be once more destined to smart under the scourge of an\r\ninvader's hand,[Footnote: Alluding to the burning of the city of\r\nWashington in the war of 1812.] that there never may be found wanting\r\namong the children of your country, a warrior to bleed, a statesman to\r\ncounsel, a chief to direct and govern, inspired with all the virtues, and\r\nendowed with all the faculties which have been so signally displayed in\r\nthe life of JAMES MONROE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS TAKES HIS SEAT IN CONGRESS--HIS POSITION AND HABITS AS A\r\nMEMBER--HIS INDEPENDENCE OF PARTY--HIS EULOGY ON THE DEATH OF EX-PRESIDENT\r\nJAMES MADISON--HIS ADVOCACY OF THE RIGHT OF PETITION, AND OPPOSITION TO\r\nSLAVERY--INSURRECTION IN TEXAS--MR. ADAMS MAKES KNOWN ITS ULTERIOR OBJECT.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams took his seat in the House of Representatives without\r\nostentation, in December, 1831. His appearance there produced a profound\r\nsensation. It was the first time an ex-President had ever entered that\r\nhall in the capacity of a member. He was received with the highest marks\r\nof respect. It presented a singular spectacle to behold members of\r\nCongress who, when Mr. Adams was President, had charged him with every\r\nspecies of political corruption, and loaded his name with the most\r\nopprobrious epithets, now vieing with one another in bestowing upon him\r\nthe highest marks of respect and confidence. That which they denied the\r\nPresident, they freely yielded to the MAN. It was the true homage which\r\nvirtue and patriotism must ever receive--more honorable, and far more\r\ngrateful to its object, than all the servility and flattery which power\r\nand patronage can so easily purchase.\r\n\r\nThe degree of confidence reposed in Mr. Adams was manifested by his being\r\nplaced at once at the head of the Committee on Manufactures. This is\r\nalways a responsible station; but it was peculiarly so at that time. The\r\nwhole Union was highly agitated on the subject of the tariff. The friends\r\nof domestic manufactures at the North insisted upon high protective\r\nduties, to sustain the mechanical and manufacturing interests of the\r\ncountry against a ruinous foreign competition. The Southern States\r\nresisted these measures as destructive to their interests, and\r\nremonstrated with the utmost vehemence against them--in which they were\r\njoined by a large portion of the Democratic party throughout the North.\r\nMr. Adams, with enlarged views of national unity and general prosperity,\r\ncounselled moderation to both parties. As Chairman of the Committee on\r\nManufactures, he strove to produce such a compromise between the\r\nconflicting interests, as should yield each section a fair protection, and\r\nrestore harmony and fraternity among the people.\r\n\r\nSo important were Mr. Adams' services deemed in the Committee on\r\nManufactures, that, on proposing to resign his post as Chairman, to fulfil\r\nother duties which claimed his attention, he was besought by all parties\r\nto relinquish his purpose. Mr. Cambreleng, of N. Y., a political opponent\r\nof Mr. Adams, said, \"It was not a pleasant duty to oppose the request of\r\nany member of the House, particularly one of his character. He did so with\r\ninfinite regret in the present instance; and he certainly would not take\r\nsuch a course, but for the important consequences that might result from\r\nassenting to the wishes of the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts.\r\nHe had reached the conclusion, not without infinite pain and reluctance,\r\nthat the harmony, if not the existence of our Confederacy, depends, at\r\nthis crisis, upon the arduous, prompt, and patriotic efforts of a few\r\neminent men. He believed that much might be done by the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same tone of high compliment, Mr. Barbour, of Virginia, said,\r\n\"that to refuse anything that could be asked by the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts gave him pain, great pain. He said it was with unaffected\r\nsincerity he declared, that the member from Massachusetts (with whom he\r\nwas associated in the committee) had not only fulfilled all his duties\r\nwith eminent ability, in the committee, but in a spirit and temper that\r\ncommanded his grateful acknowledgments, and excited his highest\r\nadmiration. Were it permitted him to make a personal appeal to the\r\ngentleman, he would have done so in advance of this motion. He would have\r\nappealed to him as a patriot, as a statesman, as a philanthropist, and\r\nabove all as an American, feeling the full force of all his duties, and\r\ntouched by all their incentives to lofty action--to forbear this request.\"\r\n\r\nThese complimentary appeals were well deserved by Mr. Adams, and show most\r\nemphatically the high position he occupied in the esteem and confidence of\r\nthe entire House of Representatives, on becoming a member thereof. But,\r\nwith the modesty of true greatness, it was painful to him to hear these\r\nencomiums uttered in his own presence. He arose, and begged the House, in\r\nwhatever further action it might take upon the subject, to refrain from\r\npursuing this strain. \"I have been most deeply affected,\" he said, \"by\r\nwhat has already passed. I have felt, in the strongest manner, the\r\nimpropriety of my being in the House while such remarks were made; being\r\nvery conscious that sentiments of an opposite kind might have been uttered\r\nwith far more propriety, and have probably been withheld in consequence of\r\nmy presence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams carried with him into Congress all his previous habits of\r\nindustry and close application to business. He was emphatically a hard\r\nworker. Few men spent more hours in the twenty-four in assiduous labor. He\r\nwould take no active part in any matter--would engage in the discussion\r\nof no topic--and would not commit himself on any question--until he had\r\nsounded it to its nether depths, and explored all its ramifications, all\r\nits bearings and influences, and had thoroughly become master of the\r\nsubject. To gain this information no toil was too great, no application\r\ntoo severe. It was in this manner that he was enabled to overwhelm with\r\nsurprise his cotemporaries in Congress, by the profundity of his\r\nknowledge. No subject could be started, no question discussed, on which he\r\nwas not perfectly at home. Without hesitation or mistake, he could pour\r\nforth a stream of facts, dates, names, places, accompanied with\r\nnarrations, anecdotes, reflections and arguments, until the matter was\r\nthoroughly sifted and laid bare in all its parts and properties, to the\r\nunderstanding of the most casual observer. The tenacity and correctness of\r\nhis memory was proverbial. Alas, for the man who questioned the\r\ncorrectness of his statements, his facts, or dates. Sure discomfiture\r\nawaited him. His mind was a perfect calendar, a store-house, a mine of\r\nknowledge, in relation to all past events connected with the history of\r\nhis country and his age.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his other exemplary virtues, Mr. Adams was prompt,\r\nfaithful, unwearied, in the discharge of all his public duties. The oldest\r\nmember of the House, he was at the same time the most punctual--the first\r\nat his post; the last to retire from the labors of the day. His practice\r\nin these respects could well put younger members to the blush. While many\r\nothers might be negligent in their attendance, sauntering in idleness,\r\nengaged in frivolous amusements, or even in dissipation, he was always at\r\nhis post. No call of the House was necessary--no Sergeant-at-arms need be\r\ndespatched--to bring him within the Hall of Representatives. He was the\r\nlast to move an adjournment, or to adopt any device to consume time or\r\nneglect the public business for personal convenience or gratification. In\r\nevery respect he was a model legislator. His example can be most\r\nprofitably imitated by those who would arise to eminence in the councils\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\n\"My seat was, for two years, by his side, and it would have scarcely more\r\nsurprised me to miss one of the marble columns of the Hall from its\r\npedestal than to see his chair empty. * * * I shall, perhaps, be pardoned\r\nfor introducing here a slight personal recollection, which serves, in some\r\ndegree, to illustrate his habits. The sessions of the last two days of (I\r\nthink) the twenty-third Congress, were prolonged, the one for nineteen,\r\nand the other for seventeen hours. At the close of the last day's session,\r\nhe remained in the hall of the House the last seated member of the body.\r\nOne after another, the members had gone home; many of them for hours. The\r\nhall--brilliantly lighted up, and gaily attended, as was, and perhaps is\r\nstill, the custom at the beginning the last evening of a session--had\r\nbecome cold, dark, and cheerless. Of the members who remained, to prevent\r\nthe public business from dying for want of a quorum, most but himself were\r\nsinking from exhaustion, although they had probably taken their meals at\r\nthe usual hours, in the course of the day. After the adjournment, I went\r\nup to Mr. Adams' seat, to join company with him, homeward; and as I knew\r\nhe came to the House at eight o'clock in the morning, and it was then past\r\nmidnight, I expressed a hope that he had taken some refreshment in the\r\ncourse of the day, He said he had not left his seat; but holding up a bit\r\nof hard bread in his fingers, gave me to understand in what way he had\r\nsustained nature.\" [Footnote: Edward Everett.]\r\n\r\nThe following reminiscence will further illustrate Mr. Adams' habits of\r\nindustry and endurance at a later day, as well as show his views in regard\r\nto the famous \"Expunging Resolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"On a cold and dreary morning, in the month of January, 1837, I went to\r\nthe capitol of the United States, at a very early hour, to write out a\r\nvery long speech I had reported for an honorable gentleman, who wished to\r\nlook well in print; and on entering the hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, I found Mr. Adams, as early as the hour was, in his seat,\r\nbusily engaged in writing. He and myself were the only persons present;\r\neven the industrious Mr. Follansbee, the then doorkeeper, had not made\r\nhis appearance, with his assistants and pages, to distribute copies of the\r\njournal and the usual documents.\r\n\r\n\"As I made it a rule never to speak to Mr. Adams, unless he spoke first, I\r\nsaid nothing; but took my seat in the reporters' gallery, and went to\r\nwork. I had written about half an hour, when the venerable statesman\r\nappeared at my desk, and was pleased to say that I was a very industrious\r\nman. I thanked him for the compliment, and, in return, remarked, that, as\r\nindustrious as I might be, I could not keep pace with him, 'for,' said I,\r\n'I found you here, sir, when I came in.'\r\n\r\n\"'I believe I was a little early, sir,' he replied; 'but, as there is to\r\nbe a closing debate to-day, in the Senate, on the expunging resolution,\r\nwhich I feel inclined to hear, I thought I would come down at an unusual\r\nhour, this morning, and dispatch a little writing before the Senate was\r\ncalled to order.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think the expunging resolution will be disposed of today?' I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"'I understand it will,' he rejoined. 'I hope so, at least,' he added,\r\n'for I think the country has already become weary of it, and is impatient\r\nfor a decision. It has already absorbed more time than should have been\r\ndevoted to it.'\r\n\r\n\"'It will pass, I suppose, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, certainly; and by a very decided majority. The administration is\r\ntoo strong for the opposition; and the affair will call up a strict party\r\nvote. Of course Mr. Clay's resolution will be expunged, and the journal\r\nwill not be violated.'\r\n\r\n\"I was somewhat surprised at the remark, and, in return, observed that I\r\nhad always understood that it was on the constitutional ground, that the\r\nexpunging process could not be effected without destroying the journal,\r\nthat the opponents of the measure had based themselves.\r\n\r\n\"'It is true, sir, that that has been the grave and somewhat tenable\r\nargument in the Senate; but it is a fallacy, after all,' he replied. 'The\r\nconstitution, sir, it is true, renders it imperative on both Houses to\r\nkeep a correct journal of its proceedings; and all this can be done, and\r\nany portion of it may be expunged, without violating that instrument. For\r\ninstance, sir, a resolution is adopted to-day, is entered on the journal,\r\nand to-morrow is expunged--and still the journal remains correct, and the\r\nconstitution is not violated. For the act by which the expungation is\r\neffected is recorded on the journal; the expunged resolution becomes a\r\nmatter of record, and thus everything stands fair and correct. The\r\nconstitution is a sacred document, and should not be violated; but how\r\noften is it strictly adhered to, to the very letter? There are, sir, some\r\nmen in the world who make great parade about their devotion to the \"dear\r\nconstitution,\"--men, sir, who make its sacred character a hobby, and who,\r\nnevertheless, are perfectly reckless of its violation, if the ends of\r\nparty are to be accomplished by its abjuration.'\r\n\r\n\"There was a degree of sarcasm blended with his enunciation of the 'dear\r\nconstitution,' which induced me to think it possible that he intended some\r\npersonal allusion when he repeated the words. In this I might, and might\r\nnot, have erred.\r\n\r\n\"'In what way, Mr. Adams,' I inquired, 'is this expunging process to be\r\naccomplished? Is the objectionable resolution to be erased from the\r\njournal with a pen; or is the leaf that contains it to be cut out?'\r\n\r\n\"'Neither process is to be resorted to, as I understand it,' he replied.\r\n'The resolution will remain in the book; black lines will be drawn around\r\nit, and across it from right angles, and the word \"expunged,\" will be\r\nwritten on the face of it. It will, to all intents and purposes, still\r\nstand on the face of the book. There are precedents in parliamentary\r\njournalism for the guidance of the Senate, and I suppose they will be\r\nadopted.'\r\n\r\n\"He then proceeded to give me a very graphic and interesting description\r\nof an expunging process that took place in the British Parliament in the\r\nreign of James the First, of England, which would repeat, if time and\r\nspace allowed. He detained me a long time, in narrating precedents, and\r\ncommenting on them; and then abruptly bringing the subject to a close,\r\nleft me to pursue my labors.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the House had been called to order, immediately after the\r\nchaplain had said his prayers--for that was a ceremonial that Mr. Adams\r\nalways observed--I saw him leave his seat, and proceed, as I supposed, to\r\nthe Senate chamber. After an hour or two had elapsed, I went into the\r\nSenate, and there found him, standing outside of the bar, listening, with\r\nall imaginable attention, to Mr. Felix Grundy, who was delivering himself\r\nof some brief remarks he had to utter on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"At nine o'clock in the evening, as I fumbled my way through the\r\nbadly-lighted rotunda, having just escaped from a caucus that had been\r\nholding 'a secret session,' in the room of the committee on public lands,\r\nI descried a light issuing from the vestibule of the Senate chamber, which\r\napprized me that 'the most dignified body on earth' was still in session.\r\nImpelled by a natural curiosity, I proceeded towards the council chamber\r\nof the right reverend signors; and, just as I reached the door, Mr. Adams\r\nstepped out. I inquired if the resolution had been disposed of.\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir,' he replied; 'nor is it probable that it will be to-night! A\r\nSenator from North Carolina is yet on the floor; and, as it does not\r\nappear likely that he will yield it very soon, and as I am somewhat faint\r\nand weary, I think I shall go home.'\r\n\r\n\"The night was very stormy. Snow was falling fast; the moon, which had\r\n\r\n                      '--not yet fill'd her horns,'\r\n\r\nhad receded beneath the western horizon; and, as the capitol was but sadly\r\nlighted, I offered my services to the venerable sage of Quincy, and at the\r\nsame time asked leave to conduct him to his dwelling.\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' said he, 'I am indebted to you for your proffered kindness; but I\r\nneed not the service of anyone. I am somewhat advanced in life, but not\r\nyet, by the blessing of God, infirm; or what Doctor Johnson would call\r\n\"superfluous;\" and you may recollect what old Adam says in the play of \"As\r\nyou like it:\"\r\n\r\n          \"For in my youth I never did apply\r\n           Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood.'\"\r\n\r\n\"For the first time in my life, I found Mr. Adams a little inclined to be\r\nfacetious; and I was glad of it--for it was to me a kind of assurance that\r\nmy presence was not absolutely unwelcome.\r\n\r\n\"The salutation being over, and Mr. Adams having consented that I should\r\nsee him down the steps of the capitol, I proceeded onward, and soon found\r\nmyself, with my revered convoy, in the vicinity of the western gate of the\r\ncapitol grounds 'The wind whistled a dismal tale,' as we trudged onward,\r\nlooking in vain for a cab; and the snow and sleet, which, early in the\r\nday, had mantled the earth, was now some twelve inches deep on\r\nPennsylvania avenue. I insisted on going onward; but Mr. Adams objected,\r\nand bidding me good night somewhat unceremoniously, told me, almost in as\r\nmany words, that my farther attendance was unwelcome.\r\n\r\n\"As I left him, he drew his 'Boston wrapper' still closer around him,\r\nhitched up his mittens, and with elastic step breasted a wintry storm that\r\nmight have repelled even the more elastic movement of juvenility, and\r\nwended up the avenue. Although I cannot irreverently say that he\r\n\r\n               'Whistled as he went, for want of thought,'\r\n\r\nI fancy that his mind was so deeply imbued with the contemplation of\r\naffairs of state, and especially in contemplating the expunging\r\nresolution, that he arrived at his home long before he was aware that he\r\nhad threaded the distance between the capitol and the Presidential\r\nsquare.\" [Footnote: Reminiscences of the late John Quincy Adams, by an Old\r\nColony Man.--New York Atlas.]\r\n\r\nAlthough elected to the House of Representatives as a Whig, and usually\r\nacting with that party, yet Mr. Adams would never acknowledge that fealty\r\nto party could justify a departure from the conscientious discharge of\r\nduty. He went with his party as far as he believed his party was right and\r\nits proceedings calculated to promote the welfare of the country. But no\r\nparty claims, no smiles nor frowns, could induce him to sanction any\r\nmeasure which he believed prejudicial to the interest of the people.\r\nHence, during his congressional career, the Whigs occasionally found him a\r\ndecided opposer of their policy and measures, on questions where he\r\ndeemed they had mistaken the true course. In this he was but true to his\r\nprinciples, character, and whole past history. It was not that he loved\r\nhis political party or friends less, but that he loved what he viewed as\r\nconducive to the welfare of the nation, more.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of action governed him in reference to his political\r\nopponents. In general he threw his influence against the administration of\r\nGen. Jackson, under a sincere conviction that its policy was injurious to\r\nthe welfare of our common country. But to every measure which he could\r\nsanction, he did not hesitate to yield the support of all his energies.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this description occurred in relation to the treaty of\r\nindemnity with France. For nearly forty years, negotiations had been\r\npending in vain with the French Government, to procure an indemnity for\r\nspoliations of American commerce, during the French Revolution and\r\nRepublic. On the 4th of July, 1831, Mr. Rives, the American Minister to\r\nFrance, succeeded in concluding a treaty with that country, securing to\r\nAmerican merchants an indemnity of five millions of dollars. But although\r\nthe treaty was duly ratified by both Governments, the French Chamber of\r\nDeputies obstinately refused, for several years, to vote an appropriation\r\nof money to fulfil its stipulations. In 1835, Gen. Jackson determined on\r\nstrong measures to bring the French Government to the discharge of its\r\nobligations. He accordingly sent a message to Congress, recommending, in\r\nthe event of further delay on the part of France, that letters of marque\r\nand reprisal be issued against the commerce of France, and at the same\r\ntime instructed Mr. Edward Livingston, our Minister at that day at the\r\nCourt of St. Cloud, to demand his passports, and retire to London. In all\r\nthese steps, which resulted in bringing France to a speedy fulfillment of\r\nthe treaty, Mr. Adams yielded his unreserved support to the\r\nadministration. He believed Gen. Jackson, in resorting to compulsory\r\nmeasures, was pursuing a course called for alike by the honor and the\r\ninterest of the country, and he did not hesitate to give him a cordial\r\nsupport, notwithstanding he was a political opponent. In a speech made by\r\nMr. Adams on the subject, in the House of Representatives, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if we do not unite with the President of the United States in an\r\neffort to compel the French Chamber of Deputies to carry out the\r\nprovisions of this treaty, we shall become the scorn, the contempt, the\r\nderision and the reproach of all mankind! Sir, this treaty has been\r\nratified on both sides of the ocean; it has received the sign manual of\r\nthe sovereign of France, through His Imperial Majesty's principal Minister\r\nof State; it has been ratified by the Senate of this Republic; it has been\r\nsanctioned by Almighty God; and still we are told, in a voice potential,\r\nin the other wing of this capitol, that the arrogance of France,--nay,\r\nsir, not of France, but of her Chamber of Deputies--the insolence of the\r\nFrench Chambers, must be submitted to, and we must come down to the lower\r\ndegradation of re-opening negotiations to attain that which has already\r\nbeen acknowledged to be our due! Sir, is this a specimen of your boasted\r\nchivalry? Is this an evidence of the existence of that heroic valor which\r\nhas so often led our arms on to glory and immortality? Re-open\r\nnegotiation, sir, with France? Do it, and soon you will find your flag\r\ninsulted, dishonored, and trodden in the dust by the pigmy States of Asia\r\nand Africa--by the very banditti of the earth. Sir, the only\r\nnegotiations, says the President of the United States, that he would\r\nencounter, should be at the cannon's mouth!\"\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by this speech was tremendous on all sides; and, for a\r\nwhile, the House was lost in the excitement it afforded. The venerable\r\norator took his seat; and, as he sank into it, the very walls shook with\r\nthe thundering applause he had awakened.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, 1836, the venerable ex-President JAMES MADISON,\r\ndeparted life at Montpelier, Va., in the eighty-sixth year of his age. He\r\nhad filled a prominent place in the history of our Government, from its\r\nfirst organization. As a statesman, he was unsurpassed in critical acumen,\r\nin profundity of knowledge, in an understanding of constitutional\r\nGovernment, and its adaptation to the rights and interests of the people.\r\nHis writings are an invaluable legacy to his countrymen, and will be\r\nstudied and quoted for ages to come. \"His public acts were a noble\r\ncommentary upon his political principles--his private life an illustration\r\nof the purest virtues of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a message from the President, announcing the death of Mr. Madison,\r\nwas received in the House of Representatives, Mr. Adams arose and said:--\r\n\r\n\"By the general sense of the House, it is with perfect propriety that the\r\ndelegation from the commonwealth of Virginia have taken the lead in the\r\nmelancholy duty of proposing the measures suitable to be adopted as\r\ntestimonials of the veneration due, from the Legislature of the Union, to\r\nthe memory of the departed patriot and sage, the native of their soil, and\r\nthe citizen of their community.\r\n\r\n\"It is not without some hesitation, and some diffidence, that I have risen\r\nto offer in my own behalf, and in that of my colleagues upon this floor,\r\nand of our common constituents, to join our voice, at once of mourning and\r\nexultation, at the event announced to both Houses of Congress, by the\r\nmessage from the President of the United States--of mourning at the\r\nbereavement which has befallen our common country, by the decease of one\r\nof her most illustrious sons--of exultation at the spectacle afforded to\r\nthe observation of the civilized world, and for the emulation of after\r\ntimes, by the close of a life of usefulness and of glory, after forty\r\nyears of service in trusts of the highest dignity and splendor that a\r\nconfiding country could bestow, succeeded by twenty years of retirement\r\nand private life, not inferior, in the estimation of the virtuous and the\r\nwise, to the honors of the highest station that ambition can ever attain.\r\n\r\n\"Of the public life of James Madison what could I say that is not deeply\r\nimpressed upon the memory and upon the heart of every one within the sound\r\nof my voice? Of his private life, what but must meet an echoing shout of\r\napplause from every voice within this hall? Is it not in a pre-eminent\r\ndegree by emanation from his mind, that we are assembled here as the\r\nrepresentatives of the people and the States of this Union? Is it not\r\ntranscendently by his exertions that we all address each other here by the\r\nendearing appellation of countrymen and fellow-citizens? Of that band of\r\nbenefactors of the human race, the founders of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, James Madison is the last who has gone to his reward. Their\r\nglorious work has survived them all. They have transmitted the precious\r\nbond of union to us, now entirely a succeeding generation to them. May it\r\nnever cease to be a voice of admonition to us, of our duty to transmit the\r\ninheritance unimpaired to our children of the rising age.\r\n\r\n\"Of the personal relations of this great man, which gave rise to the long\r\ncareer of public service in which twenty years of my own life has been\r\nengaged, it becomes me not to speak. The fulness of the heart must be\r\nsilent, even to the suppression of the overflowings of gratitude and\r\naffection.\" To the year 1835, the career of Mr. Adams in Congress had been\r\nmarked by no signal display of characteristics peculiar to himself, other\r\nthan such as the world had long been familiar with in his previous\r\nhistory. He had succeeded in maintaining his reputation for patriotism,\r\ndevotion to principle, political sagacity and wisdom, and his fame as a\r\npublic debater and eloquent speaker. But no new development of qualities\r\nunrecognized before had been made. From that year forward, however, he\r\nplaced himself in a new attitude before the country, and entered upon a\r\ncareer which eclipsed all his former services, and added a lustre to his\r\nfame which will glow in unrivalled splendor as long as human freedom is\r\nprized on earth. It can hardly be necessary to state that allusion is here\r\nmade to his advocacy of the Right of Petition, and his determined\r\nhostility to slavery. At an age when most men would leave the stormy field\r\nof public life, and retire to the quiet seclusion of domestic comfort,\r\nthese great topics inspirited Mr. Adams with a renewed vigor. With all the\r\nardor and zeal of youth, he placed himself in the front rank of the battle\r\nwhich ensued, plunged into the very midst of the melee, and, with a\r\ndauntless courage, that won the plaudits of the world, held aloft the\r\nbanner of freedom in the Halls of Congress, when other hearts quailed and\r\nfell back! He led \"the forlorn hope\" to the assault of the bulwarks of\r\nslavery, when the most sanguine believed his almost superhuman labors\r\nwould be all in vain. In these contests a spirit blazed out from his noble\r\nsoul which electrified the nation with admiration. In his intrepid bearing\r\namid these scenes he fully personified the couplet quoted in one of his\r\norations:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thy spirit, Independence, let me share,\r\n     Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye!\r\n   Thy steps I follow, with my bosom bare,\r\n     Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe first act in the career of Mr. Adams as a Member of Congress, was in\r\nrelation to slavery. On the 12th of December, 1831, it being the second\r\nweek of the first session of the twenty-second Congress, he presented\r\nfifteen petitions, all numerously signed, from sundry inhabitants of\r\nPennsylvania, praying for the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in\r\nthe District of Columbia. In presenting these petitions, Mr. Adams\r\nremarked, that although the petitioners were not of his immediate\r\nconstituents, yet he did not deem himself at liberty to decline presenting\r\ntheir petitions, the transmission of which to him manifested a confidence\r\nin him for which he was bound to be grateful. From a letter which had\r\naccompanied the petitions, he inferred that they came from members of the\r\nSociety of Friends or Quakers; a body of men, he declared, than whom there\r\nwas no more respectable and worthy class of citizens--none who more\r\nstrictly made their lives a commentary on their professions; a body of men\r\ncomprising, in his firm opinion, as much of human virtue, and as little of\r\nhuman infirmity, as any other equal number of men, of any denomination,\r\nupon the face of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe petitions for the abolition of the slave trade in the District of\r\nColumbia, Mr. Adams considered relating to a proper subject for the\r\nlegislation of Congress. But he did not give his countenance to those\r\nwhich prayed for the abolition of slavery in that District. Not that he\r\nwould approbate the system of slavery; for he was, and in fact had been\r\nthrough life, its most determined foe. But he believed the time had not\r\nthen arrived for the discussion of that subject in Congress. It was his\r\nsettled conviction that a premature agitation of slavery in the national\r\ncouncils would greatly retard, rather than facilitate, the abolition of\r\nthat giant evil--\"as the most salutary medicines,\" he declared in\r\nillustration, \"unduly administered, were the most deadly of poisons.\"\r\n\r\nThe position taken by Mr. Adams, in presenting these petitions, was\r\nevidently misunderstood by many, and especially by Abolitionists. They\r\nconstrued it into a disposition on his part to sanction, or at least to\r\nsuccumb unresistingly, to the inhumanity and enormity of the slave\r\ninstitution. In this conclusion they signally erred. Mr. Adams, by birth,\r\neducation, all the associations of his life, and the fixed principles of\r\nhis moral and political character, was an opposer of slavery in every\r\nform. No man felt more keenly the wretched absurdity of professing to base\r\nour Government on the \"self-evident truth, that all men are created equal,\r\nand endowed by their Creator with an unalienable right to life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness\"--of proclaiming our Union the abode of\r\nliberty, the \"home of the free,\" the asylum of the oppressed--while\r\nholding in our midst millions of fellow-beings manacled in hopeless\r\nbondage! No man was more anxious to correct this disgraceful misnomer, and\r\nwipe away its dark stain from our national escutcheon at the earliest\r\npracticable moment. But he was a statesman of profound knowledge and\r\nfar-reaching sagacity. He possessed the rare quality of being able to\r\n\"bide his time\" in all enterprizes. Great as he felt the enormity of\r\nAmerican slavery to be, he would not, in seeking to remove it, select a\r\ntime so unseasonable, and adopt measures so unwise, as would result,\r\nSamson-like, in removing the pillars of our great political fabric, and\r\ncrushing the glorious Union, formed by the wisdom and cemented by the\r\nblood of our Revolutionary Fathers, into a mass of ruins.\r\n\r\nBelieving there was a time to withhold and a time to strike, he would\r\npatiently wait until the sentiment of the American people became\r\nsufficiently ripened, under the increasing light and liberality of the\r\nage, to permit slavery to be lawfully and peaceably removed, while the\r\nUnion should remain unweakened and untouched--the pride of our hearts,\r\nthe admiration of the world. Hence, in his early career, he saw no\r\npropitious moment for such a work. While discharging the duties of U. S.\r\nSenator, Secretary of State, and President, an attempt in that direction\r\nwould have resulted in an aggravation of the evils of slavery, and a\r\nstrengthening of the institution. Nor on first entering Congress did he\r\nconceive the time to be fully come to engage in that agitation of the\r\nmomentous subject, which, when once commenced in earnest, would never\r\ncease until either slavery would be abolished, as far as Congress\r\npossessed constitutional power, or the Union become rent in twain! But he\r\nevidently saw that time was at hand--even at the door--and he prepared\r\nhimself for the contest.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the people of Texas took up arms in open rebellion against the\r\nGovernment of Mexico. That Province had been settled chiefly by emigrants\r\nfrom the Southern and Southwestern States. Many of them had taken their\r\nslaves with them. But the Mexican Government, to their enduring honor be\r\nit said, abolished slavery throughout that Republic. The ostensible object\r\nof the Texian insurrection was to resist certain schemes of usurpation\r\nalleged against Santa Anna, at that time President of Mexico. At the\r\npresent day, however, after having witnessed the entire progress and\r\nconsummation of the scheme, it is abundantly evident, that from the\r\nbeginning there was a deliberate and well-digested plan to re-establish\r\nslavery in Texas--annex that province to the United States--and thus\r\nimmensely increase the slave territory and influence in the Union.\r\n\r\nAt the first blast of the Texian bugle, thousands of volunteers from the\r\nslaveholding States rushed to the standard of \"the lone star.\" Agents were\r\nsent to the United States to create an interest in behalf of Texas--the\r\nmost inflammatory appeals were made to the people of the Union--and armed\r\nbodies of American citizens were openly formed in the South, and\r\ntransported without concealment to the seat of the insurrection. President\r\nJackson reminded the inhabitants of the United States of their obligations\r\nto observe neutrality in the contest between Mexico and its rebellious\r\nprovince. At the same time, Gen. Gaines, with a body of U. S. troops, was\r\nordered to take up a position within the borders of Texas. The avowed\r\nobject of this movement was to protect the people of the Southwestern\r\nfrontiers from the incursions of Indian tribes in the employment of\r\nMexico. But the presence of such a body of troops could not but exert an\r\ninfluence favorable to the measures and objects of Texas; and besides, it\r\nafterwards appeared the Indians had no disposition to take sides with\r\nMexico, or to make any depredations on the territories of the United\r\nStates. A call was made on Congress for an appropriation of a million of\r\ndollars to carry on these military operations, the entire tendency of\r\nwhich was to encourage Texas in its attempt to throw off the Mexican\r\nallegiance and re-establish slavery.\r\n\r\nThe source from whence the authorities of Texas were confidently looking\r\nfor assistance, and the ulterior object at which they were aiming in their\r\ninsurrection--viz.: annexation to the United States, and thus adding\r\nterritory and strength to the institution of slavery,--are clearly\r\nrevealed in the following extracts from a letter addressed by Gen.\r\nHouston, commander of the Texian forces, to Gen. Dunlap, of Nashville,\r\nTenn:--\r\n\r\n                                         \"Near Sabine, July, 2, 1836.\r\n\"To GEN. DUNLAP:\r\nSIR:--Your favor of the 1st of June reached me last evening. I regret so\r\nmuch delay will necessarily result before you can reach us. We will need\r\nyour aid, and that speedily. The enemy, in large numbers, are reported to\r\nbe in Texas. * * * * * The army with which they first entered Texas is\r\nbroken up and dispersed by desertion and other causes. If they get another\r\narmy of the extent proposed, it must be composed of new recruits, and men\r\npressed into service. They will not possess the mechanical efficiency of\r\ndiscipline which gives the Mexican troops the only advantage they have.\r\nThey will easily be routed by a very inferior force. For a portion of that\r\nforce, we shall be obliged to look to the United States! It cannot reach\r\nus too soon. There is but one feeling in Texas, in my opinion, and that\r\nis, to establish the independence of Texas, and TO BE ATTACHED TO THE\r\nUNITED STATES! * * * * * March as speedily as possible, with all the aid\r\nyou can bring, and I doubt not but you will be gratified with your\r\nreception and situation.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole plan succeeded beyond the anticipation of its most sanguine\r\nprojectors. Aided by men and means from the United States, Texas\r\nestablished its independence--organized a government--incorporated\r\nslavery into its constitution so thoroughly as to guard against the\r\nremotest attempt ever to remove it--and by a process unsurpassed in the\r\nannals of political intrigue, in due time became annexed to the North\r\nAmerican Union. In this accession of a territory from which several large\r\nStates will eventually be carved out, the slave power of the United States\r\nobtained a signal advantage, of which it will not be backward to avail\r\nitself in the time of its need. A faithful history of this entire movement\r\nis yet to be written.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, with his well-known and long-tried sagacity, saw at a glance\r\nthe whole design of the originators of the Texas insurrection. While most\r\npeople were averse to the belief that a project was seriously on foot to\r\nsever a large and free province from the Mexican Republic and annex it to\r\nthe Union as slave territory, he read the design in legible characters\r\nfrom the beginning. In a speech made in the House of Representatives, in\r\nMay, 1836, in reference to the call for a million of dollars, for purposes\r\nalready stated, Mr. Adams unriddled the Texian project with the vision\r\nof a prophet.\r\n\r\n\"Have we not seen American citizens,\" said Mr. Adams, \"going from all\r\nparts of the country to carry on the war of this province against the\r\nunited Government of Mexico? Who were those who fell at Alamo? Who are now\r\nfighting under the command of the hero [Footnote: General Houston.] of\r\nTexian fame? And have we not been called upon in this House, to recognize\r\nTexian independence? It seems that Gen. Gaines considers this a war in\r\ndefence of 'our Texians.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cambreleng explained that the word \"neighbors,\" had been accidentally\r\nomitted in Gen. Gaines' dispatch.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams continued:--\"Was this an intention to conquer Texas, to\r\nre-establish that slavery which had been abolished by the United Mexican\r\nStates? If that was the case, and we were to be drawn into an\r\nacknowledgment of their independence, and then, by that preliminary act,\r\nby that acknowledgment, if we were upon their application to admit Texas\r\nto become a part of the United States, then the House ought to be informed\r\nof it. I shall be for no such war, nor for making any such addition to our\r\nterritory. * * * * * * I hope Congress will take care to go into no war\r\nfor the re-establishment of slavery where it has been abolished--that they\r\nwill go into no war in behalf of 'our Texians,' or 'our Texian\r\nneighbors' and that they will go into no war with a foreign power, without\r\nother cause than the acquisition of territory.\"\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered a few days subsequent to the above, Mr. Adams used\r\nthe following language:--\r\n\r\n\"It is said that one of the earliest acts of this administration was a\r\nproposal, made at a time when there was already much ill-humor in Mexico\r\nagainst the United States, that she should cede to the United States a\r\nvery large portion of her territory--large enough to constitute nine\r\nStates equal in extent to Kentucky. It must be confessed that a device\r\nbetter calculated to produce jealousy, suspicion, ill-will and hatred,\r\ncould not have been contrived. It is further affirmed that this overture,\r\noffensive in itself, was made precisely at the time when a swarm of\r\ncolonists from these United States, were covering the Mexican border with\r\nland-jobbing, and with slaves, introduced in defiance of Mexican laws, by\r\nwhich slavery had been abolished throughout the Republic. The war now\r\nraging in Texas is a Mexican civil war, and a war for the reestablishment\r\nof slavery where it was abolished. It is not a servile war, but a war\r\nbetween slavery and emancipation, and every possible effort has been made\r\nto drive us into the war on the side of slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"When, in the year 1836, resolutions to recognize the independence of\r\nTexas came up in the House of Representatives, Mr. Adams opposed them with\r\ngreat energy and eloquence, and provoked a most ardent and violent debate.\r\nMr. Waddy Thompson, then a Representative in Congress, and subsequently\r\nMinister to Mexico, advocated the passage of the resolutions; and, in\r\ndoing so, said that Mr. Adams, in negotiating the Florida treaty, actually\r\nceded to Mexico the whole of Texas, a province that was part and parcel of\r\nthis Union.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams immediately arrested the speech of Mr. Thompson, and denied the\r\nimpeachment. Mr. Thompson rejoined, and, to strengthen his position,\r\nquoted some remarks Gen. Jackson had made on the subject, confirmatory of\r\nthe charge of having sacrificed the national domain, in the Florida\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams replied with great warmth; and went into a minute and\r\ninteresting narrative of the whole transaction. Among other things, he\r\nsaid that, before the Florida treaty was signed, he took it to Gen.\r\nJackson, to obtain his opinion of it; and that it was unconditionally\r\napproved by him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thompson was surprised at the announcement of this fact. It weakened\r\nhis position very materially; and he resumed his seat a defeated\r\nantagonist. So said the House of Representatives, with scarcely the\r\nexception of a member.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams continued his defence. 'At that time,' said he, 'General\r\nJackson was in this city, on exciting business connected with the Seminole\r\nwar; and, after the treaty had been concluded, and only wanted the\r\nsignatures of the contracting parties, the then President of the United\r\nStates directed me to call on General Jackson, in my official capacity as\r\nSecretary of State, and obtain his opinion in reference to boundaries. I\r\ndid call. General Jackson, sir, was at that time holding his quarters in\r\nthe hotel at the other end of the avenue, now kept by Mr. Azariah Fuller,\r\nbut then under the management of Jonathan McCarty. The day was\r\nexceedingly warm, and, on entering General Jackson's parlor, I found him\r\nmuch exhausted by excitement, and the intensity of the weather. I made\r\nknown to him the object of my visit; when he replied that I would greatly\r\noblige him if I would excuse him from looking into the matter then. \"Leave\r\nthe papers with me, sir, till to-morrow, or the next day, and I will\r\nexamine them.\" I did leave them sir; and the next day called for the\r\nhero's opinion and decision. Sir, I recollect the occurrence perfectly\r\nwell; General Jackson was still unwell; and the papers, with an\r\naccompanying map, were spread before him. With his cane, sir, he pointed\r\nto the boundaries, as they had been agreed upon by the parties; and, sir,\r\nwith a very emphatic expression, which I need not repeat, he affirmed\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\"This debate, whilst yet warm from the hands of the reporters, reached\r\nGeneral Jackson; and was at once pressed upon his attention. Its\r\ncontradiction and refutation were deemed matters of paramount importance.\r\nThe old soldier did not hesitate long to act in the matter, and speedily\r\nthere appeared in the Globe newspaper a letter, signed Andrew Jackson,\r\ndenying, in unqualified and unconditional terms, everything that Mr. Adams\r\nhad uttered. He denied having been in Washington at the time Mr. Adams\r\ndesignated; but afterwards, being convinced that he was in error, in this\r\nfact only he corrected himself, but denied most positively that he had\r\nseen the Florida treaty, or Mr. Adams, at the time of its negotiation, or\r\nthat he had had the remotest agency or connection with the transaction.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams responded, and appealed to his diary, where everything was set\r\nforth with the utmost precision and accuracy. The year, day of the month,\r\nand of the week, and the very hour of the day, all were faithfully\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n\"The affair produced much sensation at Washington; and even the most\r\ndetermined advocates of General Jackson believed that he, and not Mr.\r\nAdams, was in error, No one would, or could for a moment, believe that Mr.\r\nAdams' had made a false report.'\r\n\r\n\"Whilst this controversy was pending, I called at the Presidential\r\nmansion, one afternoon, when General Jackson, strange to say, happened to\r\nbe alone. He said that he was very glad to see me, because he would like\r\nto hear, from one who had an opportunity of seeing more of the press than\r\nhe saw, what was the exact state of public opinion, in regard to the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n\"'As far as I am capable of judging, Mr. President,' I replied, 'the\r\npeople appear to be unanimous in the opinion that there is a\r\nmisunderstanding, a misapprehension, between you and Mr. Adams; for no one\r\nimagines, for a moment, that either of you would misrepresent facts! Mr.\r\nAdams is a man of infinite method; he is generally accurate, and, in this\r\ninstance, it appears that he is sustained by his diary.'\r\n\r\n\"'His diary! don't tell' me anything more about his diary! Sir, that diary\r\ncomes up on all occasions--one would think that its pages were as\r\nimmutable as the laws of the Medes and Persians! Sir, that diary will be\r\nthe death of me! I wonder if James Monroe kept a diary! If he did, it is\r\nto be hoped that it will be looked to, to see if it contains anything\r\nabout this Adams and Dan Onis treaty. Sir, I did not see it; I was not\r\nconsulted about it.'\r\n\r\n\"The old hero was exceedingly vehement, and was proceeding to descant with\r\nespecial violence, when he was interrupted by the entrance of Mr.\r\nSecretary Woodbury, and I never heard another word about the matter. A\r\nquestion of veracity between the parties was raised, and was never\r\nadjudicated. Both went down to the grave before any definite light was\r\ncast on the subject; but the world had decided that General Jackson was in\r\nerror.\" [Footnote: Reminiscences of the late John Quincy Adams, by an Old\r\nColony Man.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS PRESENTS PETITIONS FOR THE ABOLISHMENT OF SLAVERY--OPPOSITION\r\nOF SOUTHERN MEMBERS--EXCITING SCENES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--\r\nMARKS OF CONFIDENCE IN MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, during the years 1836 and 1837, the public mind in the\r\nNorthern States, became fully aroused to the enormities of American\r\nslavery--its encroachments on the rights and interests of the free\r\nStates--the undue influence it was exercising in our national\r\ncouncils--and the evident determination to enlarge its borders and its\r\nevils, by the addition of new and large territories. Petitions for the\r\nabolition of slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia and\r\nthe Territories, began to pour into Congress, from every section of the\r\nEast and North. These were generally presented by Mr. Adams. His age and\r\nexperience--his well-known influence in the House of Representatives--his\r\npatriotism, and his intrepid advocacy of human freedom--inspired the\r\nconfidence of the people of the free States, and led them to entrust to\r\nhim their petitions. With scrupulous fidelity he performed the duty thus\r\nimposed upon him. Whoever petitions might come from--whatever the nature\r\nof  their prayer--whether for such objects as he could sanction or not--if\r\nthey were clothed in respectful language, Mr. Adams felt himself under an\r\nimperative obligation to present them to Congress. For several sessions at\r\nthis period, few days passed without his presenting more or less petitions\r\nhaving some relation to the subject of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe southern members of Congress became alarmed at these demonstrations,\r\nand determined to arrest them, even at the sacrifice, if need be, of the\r\nright of petition--the most sacred privilege of freemen. On the 8th of\r\nFeb., 1836, a committee was raised by the House of Representatives, to\r\ntake into consideration what disposition should be made of petitions and\r\nmemorials for the abolition of slavery and the slave trade, in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and report thereon. This committee consisted of\r\nMessrs. Pinckney of South Carolina, Hamer of Ohio, Pierce of New\r\nHampshire, Hardin of Kentucky, Jarvis of Maine, Owens of Georgia,\r\nMuhlenberg of Pennsylvania, Dromgoole of Virginia, and Turrill of New\r\nYork. On the 18th of May, the committee made a lengthy and unanimous\r\nreport, through Mr. Pinckney, recommending the adoption of the following\r\nresolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Congress possesses no constitutional authority to\r\ninterfere in any way with the institution of slavery in any of the States\r\nof this Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Congress ought not to interfere in any way with slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, It is extremely important and desirable that the agitation\r\nof this subject should be finally arrested, for the purpose of restoring\r\ntranquillity to the public mind, your committee respectfully recommend the\r\nadoption of the following additional resolution, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That all petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions or\r\npapers, relating in any way, or to any extent whatever, to the subject of\r\nslavery, or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being either printed\r\nor referred, be laid upon the table, and that no further action whatever\r\nshall be had thereon.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first of these resolutions was taken up, Mr. Adams said, if the\r\nHouse would allow him five minutes' time, he would prove the resolution to\r\nbe untrue. His request was denied.\r\n\r\nOn the third resolution Mr. Adams refused to vote, and sent to the\r\nSpeaker's chair the following declaration, demanding that it should be\r\nplaced on the journal of the House, there to stand to the latest\r\nposterity:--\r\n\r\n\"I hold the resolution to be a direct violation of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, of the rules of this House, and of the rights of my\r\nconstituents.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rule embodied in this resolution virtually trampled\r\nthe right of petition into the dust, yet it was adopted by the House, by a\r\nlarge majority. But Mr. Adams was not to be deterred by this arbitrary\r\nrestriction, from a faithful discharge of his duty as a representative of\r\nthe people. Petitions on the subject of slavery continued to be\r\ntransmitted to him in increased numbers. With unwavering firmness--against\r\na bitter and unscrupulous opposition, exasperated to the highest pitch by\r\nhis pertinacity--amidst a perfect tempest of vituperation and abuse--he\r\npersevered in presenting these petitions, one by one, to the amount\r\nsometimes of two hundred in a day--demanding the action of the House on\r\neach separate petition.\r\n\r\nHis position amid these scenes was in the highest degree illustrious and\r\nsublime. An old man, with the weight of years upon him, forgetful of the\r\nelevated stations he had occupied, and the distinguished honors received\r\nfor past services, turning away from the repose which age so greatly\r\nneeds, and laboring, amidst scorn and derision, and threats of expulsion\r\nand assassination, to maintain the sacred right of petition for the\r\npoorest and humblest in the land--insisting that the voice of a free\r\npeople should be heard by their representatives, when they would speak in\r\ncondemnation of human slavery and call upon them to maintain the\r\nprinciples of liberty embodied in the immortal Declaration of\r\nIndependence--was a spectacle unwitnessed before in the history of\r\nlegislation. A few specimens of these transactions will enable the reader\r\nto judge of the trials Mr. Adams was compelled to endure in the discharge\r\nof his duties, and also of his moral courage and indomitable perseverance,\r\namid the most appalling circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of Jan., 1837, Mr. Adams presented the petition of one hundred\r\nand fifty women, whom he stated to be the wives and daughters of his\r\nimmediate constituents, praying for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and moved that the petition be read.\r\n\r\nMr. Glascock objected to its reception.\r\n\r\nMr. Parks moved that the preliminary motion, on the reception of the\r\npetition, be laid on the table, which was carried.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams said, that if he had understood the decision of the Speaker in\r\nthis case, it was not the petition itself which was laid upon the table,\r\nbut the motion to receive. In order to save the time of the House, he\r\nwished to give notice that he should call up that motion, for decision,\r\nevery day, so long as he should be permitted to do so by the House;\r\nbecause he should not consider his duty accomplished so long as the\r\npetition was not received, and so long as the House had not decided that\r\nit would not receive it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney rose to a question of order, and inquired if there was now\r\nany question pending before the House?\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said, he had understood the gentleman from Massachusetts as\r\nmerely giving notice of a motion hereafter to be made. In doing so, it\r\ncertainly was not in order to enter into debate.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams said, that so long as freedom of speech was allowed to him as a\r\nmember of that House, he would call up that question until it should be\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was called to order.\r\n\r\nMr. A. said, he would then have the honor of presenting to the House the\r\npetition of two hundred and twenty-eight women, the wives and daughters of\r\nhis immediate constituents; and as a part of the speech which he intended\r\nto make, he would take the liberty of reading the petition. It was not\r\nlong, and would not consume much time.\r\n\r\nMr. Glascock objected to the reception of the petition.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams proceeded to read, that the petitioners, inhabitants of South\r\nWeymouth, in the State of Massachusetts, \"impressed with the sinfulness of\r\nslavery, and keenly aggrieved by its existence in a part of our country\r\nover which Congress--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney rose to a question of order. Had the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts a right, under the rule, to read the petition?\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said, the gentleman from Massachusetts had a right to make a\r\nstatement of the contents of the petition.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney desired the decision of the Speaker as to whether a\r\ngentleman had a right to read a petition.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams said he was reading the petition as a part of his speech, and he\r\ntook this to be one of the privileges of a member of the House. It was a\r\nprivilege he would exercise till he should be deprived of it by some\r\npositive act.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker repeated that the gentleman from Massachusetts had a right to\r\nmake a brief statement of the contents of the petition. It was not for the\r\nSpeaker to decide whether that brief statement should be made in the\r\ngentleman's own language, or whether he should look over the petition, and\r\ntake his statement from that.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--At the time my friend from South Carolina--\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said the gentleman must proceed to state the contents of the\r\npetition.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.-I am doing so, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker.--Not in the opinion of the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--I was at this point of the petition--\"Keenly aggrieved by its\r\nexistence in a part of our country over which Congress possesses exclusive\r\njurisdiction in all cases whatsoever--\"\r\n\r\nLoud cries of \"Order,\" \"Order!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.-\"Do most earnestly petition your honorable body--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chambers of Kentucky rose to a point of order.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--\"Immediately to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chambers reiterated his call to order, and the Speaker directed Mr.\r\nAdams to take his seat.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams proceeded with great rapidity of enunciation, and in a very loud\r\ntone of voice--\"And to declare every human being free who sets foot upon\r\nits soil!\"\r\n\r\nThe confusion in the hall at this time was very great. The Speaker decided\r\nthat it was not in order for a member to read a petition, whether it was\r\nlong or short.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams appealed from any decision which went to establish the principle\r\nthat a member of the House should not have the power to read what he\r\nchose. He had never before heard of such a thing. If this practice was to\r\nbe reversed, let the decision stand upon record, and let it appear how\r\nentirely the freedom of speech was suppressed in this House. If the\r\nreading of a paper was to be suppressed in his person, so help him God, he\r\nwould only consent to it as a matter of record.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams finished the petition. The petitioners \"respectfully announce\r\ntheir intention to present the same petition yearly before this honorable\r\nbody, that it might at least be a memorial in the holy cause of human\r\nfreedom that they had done what they could.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were read amidst tumultuous cries for \"order,\" from every part\r\nof the House. The petition was finally received, and laid upon the table.\r\n\r\nOther scenes of a still more exciting character soon occurred.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of February, 1837, after Mr. Adams had offered some two hundred\r\nor more abolition petitions, he came to a halt; and, without yielding the\r\nfloor, employed himself in packing up his budget. He was about resuming\r\nhis seat, when he took up a paper, and hastily glancing at it, exclaimed,\r\nin a shrill tone--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, I have in my possession a petition of a somewhat\r\nextraordinary character; and I wish to inquire of the chair if it be in\r\norder to present it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the gentleman from Massachusetts,\" said the Speaker, \"will inform the\r\nchair what the character of the petition is, it will probably be able to\r\ndecide on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" ejaculated Mr. Adams, \"the petition is signed by eleven slaves of\r\nthe town of Fredericksburgh, in the county of Culpepper, in the state of\r\nVirginia. It is one of those petitions which, it has occurred to my mind,\r\nare not what they purport to be. It is signed partly by persons who cannot\r\nwrite, by making their marks, and partly by persons whose handwriting\r\nwould manifest that they have received the education of slaves. The\r\npetition declares itself to be from slaves, and I am requested to present\r\nit. I will send it to the chair.\"\r\n\r\nThe Speaker (Mr. Polk,) who habitually extended to Mr. Adams every\r\ncourtesy and kindness imaginable, was taken by surprise, and found himself\r\ninvolved in a dilemma. Giving his chair one of those hitches which ever\r\ndenoted his excitement, he said that a petition from slaves was a novelty,\r\nand involved a question that he did not feel called upon to decide. He\r\nwould like to take time to consider it; and, in the meantime, would refer\r\nit to the House.\r\n\r\nThe House was very thin at the time, and little attention was paid to what\r\nwas going on, till the excitement of the Speaker attracted the attention\r\nof Mr. Dixon H. Lewis, of Alabama, who impatiently, and under great\r\nexcitement, rose and inquired what the petition was.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker afforded the required information. Mr. Lewis, forgetting all\r\ndiscretion, whilst he frothed at the mouth, turned towards Mr. Adams, and\r\nejaculated at the top of his voice, \"By G-d, sir, this is not to be\r\nendured any longer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Treason! treason!\" screamed a half dozen other members. \"Expel the old\r\nscoundrel; put him out; do not let him disgrace the House any longer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up a resolution to meet the case,\" exclaimed a member from North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nMr. George C. Dromgoole, who had acquired a very favorable reputation as\r\na parliamentarian, was selected as the very man who, of all others, was\r\nmost capable of drawing up a resolution that would meet and cover the\r\nemergency. He produced a resolution with a preamble, in which it was\r\nstated, substantially, that, whereas the Hon. John Quincy Adams, a\r\nrepresentative from Massachusetts, had presented to the House of\r\nRepresentatives a petition signed by negro slaves, thus \"giving color to\r\nan idea\" that bondmen were capable of exercising the right of petition, it\r\nwas \"Resolved, That he be taken to the bar of the House, and be censured\r\nby the Speaker thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Haynes said, the true motion, in his judgment, would be to move that\r\nthe petition be rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis hoped that no motion of that kind would come from any gentleman\r\nfrom a slaveholding section of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Haynes said he would cheerfully withdraw his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis was glad the motion was withdrawn. He believed that the House\r\nshould punish severely such an infraction of its decorum and its rules;\r\nand he called on the members from the slaveholding States to come forward\r\nnow and demand of the House the punishment of the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Grantland, of Georgia, would second the motion, and go all lengths in\r\nsupport of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis said, that if the House would inflict no punishment for such\r\nflagrant violations of its dignity as this, it would be better for the\r\nRepresentatives from the slaveholding Slates to go home at once.\r\n\r\nMr. Alford said, if the gentleman from Massachusetts intended to present\r\nthis petition, the moment it was presented he should move, as an act of\r\njustice to the South, which he in part represented, and which he conceived\r\nhad been treated with indignity, that it be taken from the House and\r\nburnt; and he hoped that every man who was a friend to the constitution,\r\nwould support him. There must be an end to this constant attempt to raise\r\nexcitement, or the Union could not exist much longer. The moment any man\r\nshould disgrace the Government under which he lived, by presenting a\r\npetition from slaves, praying for emancipation, he hoped that petition\r\nwould, by order of the House, be committed to the flames.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddy Thompson moved the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Hon. John Quincy Adams, by the attempt just made by\r\nhim to introduce a petition purporting on its face to be from slaves, has\r\nbeen guilty of a gross disrespect to this House, and that he be instantly\r\nbrought to the bar, to receive the severe censure of the Speaker.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of bringing the venerable ex-President to the bar, like a\r\nculprit, to receive a reprimand from a comparatively youthful Speaker,\r\nwould be a spectacle so disgraceful, and withal so absurd, that the\r\nproposition met with no favor. An easier way to reprimand was devised. Mr.\r\nHaynes introduced the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That John Quincy Adams, a Representative from the State of\r\nMassachusetts, has rendered himself justly liable to the severest censure\r\nof this House, and is censured accordingly, for having attempted to\r\npresent to the House the petition of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other resolutions and propositions, from members of slaveholding\r\nStates, were submitted to the House; but none proved satisfactory even to\r\nthemselves. Mr. Adams, unmoved by the tempest which raged around him,\r\ndefended himself, and the integrity of his purpose, with the distinguished\r\nability and eloquence which characterized all his public labors.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the resolutions now before the House,\" said he, \"as they all\r\nconcur in naming me, and in charging me with high crimes and misdemeanors,\r\nand in calling me to the bar of the House to answer for my crimes, I have\r\nthought it was my duty to remain silent, until it should be the pleasure\r\nof the House to act either on one or the other of these resolutions. I\r\nsuppose that if I shall be brought to the bar of the House, I shall not be\r\nstruck mute by the previous question, before I have an opportunity to say\r\na word or two in my own defence. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to the fact what the petition was for, I simply state to the\r\ngentleman from Alabama, (Mr. D. H. Lewis,) who has sent to the table a\r\nresolution assuming that this petition was for the abolition of slavery--I\r\nstate to him that he is mistaken. He must amend his resolution; for if the\r\nHouse should choose to read this petition, I can state to them they would\r\nfind it something very much the reverse of that which the resolution\r\nstates it to be. And if the gentleman from Alabama still chooses to bring\r\nme to the bar of the House, he must amend his resolution in a very\r\nimportant particular; for he may probably have to put into it, that my\r\ncrime has been for attempting to introduce the petition of slaves that\r\nslavery should not be abolished. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is well known, that from the time I entered this House, down to\r\nthe present day, I have felt it a sacred duty to present any petition,\r\ncouched in respectful language, from any citizen of the United States, be\r\nits object what it may; be the prayer of it that in which I could concur,\r\nor that to which I was utterly opposed. It is for the sacred right of\r\npetition that I have adopted this course. * * * * * * * * Where is your\r\nlaw which says that the mean, and the low, and the degraded, shall be\r\ndeprived of the right of petition, if their moral character is not good?\r\nWhere, in the land of freemen, was the right of petition ever placed on\r\nthe exclusive basis of morality and virtue? Petition is supplication--it\r\nis entreaty--it is prayer! And where is the degree of vice or immorality\r\nwhich shall deprive the citizen of the right to supplicate for a boon, or\r\nto pray for mercy? Where is such a law to be found? It does not belong to\r\nthe most abject despotism! There is no absolute monarch on earth, who is\r\nnot compelled, by the constitution of his country, to receive the\r\npetitions of his people, whosoever they may be. The Sultan of\r\nConstantinople cannot walk the streets and refuse to receive petitions\r\nfrom the meanest and vilest of the land. This is the law even of\r\ndespotism. And what does your law say? Does it say that, before presenting\r\na petition, you shall look into it, and see whether it comes from the\r\nvirtuous, and the great, and the mighty? No sir; it says no such thing.\r\nThe right of petition belongs to all. And so far from refusing to present\r\na petition because it might come from those low in the estimation of the\r\nworld, it would be an additional incentive, if such incentive were\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n\"But I must admit,\" continued Mr. Adams, sarcastically, \"that when color\r\ncomes into the question, there may be other considerations. It is possible\r\nthat this house, which seems to consider it so great a crime to attempt to\r\noffer a petition from slaves, may, for aught I know, say that freemen, if\r\nnot of the carnation, shall be deprived of the right of petition, in the\r\nsense of the House.\"\r\n\r\nWhen southern members saw that, in their haste, they had not tarried to\r\nascertain the nature of the petition, and that it prayed for the\r\nperpetuation, instead of the abolition of slavery, their position became\r\nso ludicrous, that their exasperation was greatly increased. At the time\r\nthe petition was announced by Mr. Adams, the House was very thin; but the\r\nexcitement it produced soon filled it; and, besides, the sergeant-at-arms\r\nhad been instructed to arrest and bring in all absentees. The excitement\r\ncommenced at about one o'clock, and continued until seven o'clock in the\r\nevening, when the House adjourned. Mr. Adams stood at his desk, resolutely\r\nrefusing to be seated till the matter was disposed of, alleging that if he\r\nwere guilty, he was not entitled to a seat among high and honorable men.\r\nWhen Mr. Droomgoole's resolution was read to the House for its\r\nconsideration, Mr. Adams yielded to it one of those sarcastic sneers which\r\nhe was in the habit of giving, when provoked to satire; and said--\"Mr.\r\nSpeaker, if I understand the resolution of the honorable gentleman from\r\nVirginia, it charges me with being guilty of giving color to an idea!'\"\r\nThe whole House broke forth in one common irrepressible peal of laughter.\r\nThe Droomgoole resolution was actually laughed out of existence. The\r\nHouse now found that it had got itself in a dilemma,--that Mr. Adams was\r\ntoo much for it; and, at last, adjourned, leaving the affair in the\r\nposition in which they found it.\r\n\r\nFor several days this subject continued to agitate the House. Mr. Adams\r\nnot only warded off the virulent attacks made upon him, but carried the\r\nwar so effectually into the camp of his enemies, that, becoming heartily\r\ntired of the contest, they repeatedly endeavored to get rid of the whole\r\nsubject by laying it on the table. To this Mr. Adams objected. He insisted\r\nthat it should be thoroughly canvassed. Immense excitement ensued. Call\r\nafter call of the House was made. Mr. Henry A. Wise, who was, at the time,\r\nengaged on the Reuben Whitney affair, was sent for: with an accompanying\r\nmessage that the stability of the Union was in danger!\r\n\r\nBreathless, and impatient, Mr. Wise made his appearance, and inquired what\r\nwas the matter. He was informed.\r\n\r\n\"And is that all?\" ejaculated Mr. Wise. \"The gentleman from Massachusetts\r\nhas presented a petition signed by slaves! Well, sir, and what of that? Is\r\nanybody harmed by it? Sir, in my opinion, slaves are the very persons who\r\nshould petition. Mine, sir, pray to me, and I listen to them; and shall\r\nnot the feeble supplicate? Sir, I see no danger,--the country, I believe,\r\nis safe.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the exciting subject was brought to a termination, by the\r\npassage of the following preamble and resolutions; much softened, it will\r\nbe seen, in comparison with the measures first proposed:--\r\n\r\n\"An inquiry having been made by an honorable gentleman from Massachusetts,\r\nwhether a paper which he held in his hand, purporting to be a petition\r\nfrom certain slaves, and declaring themselves to be slaves, came within\r\nthe order of the House of the 18th of January,[Footnote: This order was\r\nthe same as that adopted by the House on the 18th of May, 1836. See p.\r\n281.] and the said paper not having been received by the Speaker, he\r\nstated that in a case so extraordinary and novel, he would take the advice\r\nand counsel of the House.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this House cannot receive said petition without\r\ndisregarding its own dignity, the rights of a large class of citizens of\r\nthe South and West, and the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That slaves do not possess the right of petition secured to\r\nthe citizens of the United States by the constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave petition is believed to have been a counterfeit, manufactured by\r\ncertain members from slaveholding States, and was sent to Mr. Adams by the\r\nway of experiment--with the double design of ascertaining if he could be\r\nimposed upon; and, if the deception succeeded, those who got it up were\r\ncurious to know if the venerable statesman would redeem his pledge, and\r\npresent a petition, no matter who it came from. He was too wily not to\r\ndetect the plot at the outset; he knew that all was a hoax; but, he\r\nresolved to present the paper, and then turn the tables on its authors.\r\n[Footnote: Reminiscences of the late John Quincy Adams, by an Old Colony\r\nMan.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1838, Mr. Adams presented a petition praying for\r\nthe establishment of international relations with the Republic of Hayti,\r\nand moved that it be referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with\r\ninstructions to consider and report thereon. This motion was opposed with\r\ngreat warmth by members from slaveholding States. Mr. Adams was repeatedly\r\ninterrupted during the delivery of the brief speech he made on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Bynum insisted that the gentleman from Massachusetts should take his\r\nseat, under the rule. If, however, he was permitted to proceed, Mr. B.\r\nhoped some gentleman of the slaveholding portion of the House would be\r\nallowed to answer him.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--Sir, I hope so. Only open our mouths, gentlemen; that is all\r\nwe ask, and you may answer as much as you please.\r\n\r\nMr. Bynum.--I object to the gentleman proceeding further with his\r\nobservations, except by consent of the House. If we have rules we had\r\nbetter either obey them or burn them.\r\n\r\nThe House voted, by 114 to 47, to allow Mr. Adams to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn continuing his speech, Mr. Adams said, that even admitting the object\r\nof the petitioners is abolition, as has been alleged, they had the right\r\nto petition for that too; for every individual in the country had a right\r\nto be an abolitionist. The great men of the Revolution were abolitionists,\r\nand if any man denies it, I will prove it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise.--I deny it.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said this was out of order.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--I feel obliged to the gentleman from Virginia for giving me\r\nthe invitation, and I will now prove what I say.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said this did not form any part of the question before the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--George Washington, in articulo mortis, by his last will and\r\ntestament, before God, his Creator, emancipated his slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise.--Because he had no children.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker again interposed, and said the gentleman could not go into\r\nthat question. It was entirely out of order.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--I did but accept the invitation of the gentleman from\r\nVirginia. I do not wish to go further. I simply take the position that\r\nGeorge Washington was an abolitionist in the most extensive sense of the\r\nterm; and I defy any man in this House to the discussion, and to prove to\r\nthe contrary if he can.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker called Mr. Adams to order.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--Well, sir, I was stating the high authority which is to be\r\nfound for the principles of abolition. Does the gentleman from Virginia\r\ndeny that Thomas Jefferson was an abolitionist?\r\n\r\nMr. Wise.--I do.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker again interposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams.--Well, sir, then I come back to my position, that every man in\r\nthis country has a right to be an abolitionist, and that in being so he\r\noffends no law, but, in my opinion, obeys the most sacred of all laws.\r\n\r\nThe motion to instruct the committee, was finally laid upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was evidently anxious to engage in a legitimate discussion, in\r\nthe House of Representatives, of the subject of slavery in all its\r\nbearings, influences, and results. Such a discussion, coolly and\r\ndeliberately entered upon, by men of the most distinguished abilities in\r\nthe nation, could not but have been pregnant with lasting good, not only\r\nto the North, but also to the South and the entire country. To afford\r\nopportunity for a dignified and profitable investigation of this momentous\r\ntopic, Mr. Adams, on the 25th of Feb., 1839, proposed the following\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress\r\nassembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring therein, That the\r\nfollowing amendments to the Constitution of the United States be proposed\r\nto the several States of the Union, which, when ratified by three-fourths\r\nof the legislatures of said States, shall become and be a part of the\r\nConstitution of the United States:--\r\n\r\n\"1. From and after the 4th day of July, 1842, there shall be throughout\r\nthe United States no hereditary slavery; but on and after that day, every\r\nchild born within the United States, their territories or jurisdiction,\r\nshall be born free.\r\n\r\n\"2. With the exception of the territory of Florida, there shall henceforth\r\nnever be admitted into this Union, any State, the constitution of which\r\nshall tolerate within the same the existence of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"3. From and after the 4th day of July, 1845, there shall be neither\r\nslavery nor slave trade, at the seat of Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of meeting and canvassing, in a manly and honorable manner, the\r\nvitally important question involved in these propositions, the\r\nslaveholding Representatives objected to its coming before the House for\r\nconsideration, in any form whatever. In this instance, as in most others,\r\nwhere the merits of slavery are involved, the supporters of that\r\ninstitution manifested a timidity, a want of confidence in its legitimacy,\r\nof the most suspicious nature. If slavery is lawful and defensible--if it\r\nviolates no true principle among men, no human right bestowed by the\r\nCreator--if it can be tolerated and perpetuated in harmony with republican\r\ninstitutions and our Declaration of Independence--if its existence in the\r\nbosom of the Confederacy involves no incongruity, and is calculated to\r\npromote the prosperity and stability of the Union, or the welfare of the\r\nslaveholding States themselves--these are facts which can be made evident\r\nto the world, by the unsurpassed abilities of southern statesmen. Why,\r\nthen, object to a candid and fearless investigation of the subject? But if\r\nslavery is the reverse of all this--if it is a moral poison, contaminating\r\nand blighting everything connected with it, and containing the seeds of\r\nits own dissolution sooner or later--why should wise, sagacious\r\npoliticians, prudent and honest men, and conscientious Christians, shut\r\ntheir eyes and turn away from a fact so appalling and so dangerous. No man\r\nof intelligence can hope, in this age of the world, to perpetuate that\r\nwhich is wrong and destructive, by bravado and threatening--by refusing to\r\nlook it in the face, or to allow others to scrutinize it. Error must pass\r\naway. Truth, however unpalatable, or however it may be obscured for a\r\nseason, must eventually triumph. The very exertions of its supporters to\r\nperpetuate wrong, will but hasten its death.\r\n\r\n  \"Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again;\r\n     Th' eternal years of God are hers:\r\n   But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,\r\n     And dies among her worshippers.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the course Mr. Adams felt himself compelled to pursue led\r\nhim frequently into collision with a large portion of the Members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and caused them sometimes, in the heat of\r\nexcitement, to forget the deference due his age, his experience, and\r\ncommanding abilities, yet there was ever a deep, under-current feeling of\r\nveneration for him, pervading all hearts. Those who were excited to the\r\nhighest pitch of frenzy by his proceedings, could not but admire the\r\nsingleness of his purpose, and his undaunted courage in discharging his\r\nduties. On all subjects aside from slavery, his influence in the House has\r\nnever been surpassed. Whenever he arose to speak, it was a signal for a\r\ngeneral abandonment of listlessness and inattention. Members dropped their\r\nnewspapers and pamphlets--knots of consulting politicians in different\r\nparts of the Hall were dissolved--Representatives came hastily in from\r\nlobbies, committee-rooms, the surrounding grounds--and all eagerly\r\nclustered around his chair to listen to words of wisdom, patriotism, and\r\ntruth, as they dropped burning from the lips of \"the old man eloquent!\"\r\nThe confidence placed in him in emergencies, was unbounded. A case in\r\npoint is afforded in the history of the difficulty occasioned by the\r\ndouble delegation from New Jersey.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the 26th Congress, in December, 1839, in consequence of\r\na two-fold delegation from New-Jersey, the House was unable, for some\r\ntime, to complete its organization, and presented to the country and the\r\nworld the perilous and discreditable aspect of the assembled\r\nRepresentatives of the people, unable to form themselves into a\r\nconstitutional body. On first assembling, the House has no officers, and\r\nthe Clerk of the preceding Congress acts, by usage, as chairman of the\r\nbody, till a Speaker is chosen. On this occasion, after reaching the State\r\nof New Jersey, the acting Clerk declined to proceed in calling the roll,\r\nand refused to entertain any of the motions which were made for the\r\npurpose of extricating the House from its embarrassment. Many of the\r\nablest and most judicious members had addressed the House in vain, and\r\nthere was nothing but confusion and disorder in prospect.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day opened, and still confusion was triumphant. But the hour of\r\ndisenthrallment was at hand, and a scene was presented which sent the\r\nmind back to those days when Cromwell uttered the exclamation--\"Sir Harry\r\nVane! wo unto you, Sir Harry Vane!\"--and in an instant dispersed the\r\nfamous Rump Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, from the opening of this scene of confusion and anarchy, had\r\nmaintained a profound silence. He appeared to be engaged most of the time\r\nin writing. To a common observer, he seemed to be reckless of everything\r\naround him--but nothing, not the slightest incident, escaped him. The\r\nfourth day of the struggle had now commenced; Mr. Hugh H. Garland, the\r\nClerk, was directed to call the roll again.\r\n\r\nHe commenced with Maine, as was usual in those days, and was proceeding\r\ntoward Massachusetts. I turned, and saw that Mr. Adams was ready to get\r\nthe floor at the earliest moment possible. His keen eye was riveted on the\r\nClerk; his hands clasped the front edge of his desk, where he always\r\nplaced them to assist him in rising. He looked, in the language of Otway,\r\nlike the\r\n\r\n                     \"--fowler, eager for his prey.\"\r\n\r\n\"New Jersey!\" ejaculated Mr. Hugh H. Garland, \"and the Clerk has to repeat\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams sprang to the floor!\r\n\r\n\"I rise to interrupt the Clerk,\" was his first ejaculation.\r\n\r\n\"Silence, silence,\" resounded through the hall; \"hear him, hear him! Here\r\nwhat he has to say; hear John Quincy Adams!\" was the unanimous ejaculation\r\non all sides.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the most profound silence reigned throughout the Hall--you\r\nmight have heard a leaf of paper fall in any part of it--and every eye was\r\nriveted on the venerable Nestor of Massachusetts--the purest of\r\nstatesmen, and the noblest of men! He paused for a moment; and, having\r\ngiven Mr. Garland a\r\n\r\n                           \"--withering look!\"\r\n\r\nhe proceeded to address the multitude:\r\n\r\n\"It was not my intention,\" said he, \"to take any part in these\r\nextraordinary proceedings. I had hoped that this House would succeed in\r\norganizing itself; that a Speaker and Clerk would be elected, and that the\r\nordinary business of legislation would be progressed in. This is not the\r\ntime, or place, to discuss the merits of the conflicting claimants for\r\nseats from New Jersey; that subject belongs to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, which, by the constitution, is made the ultimate arbiter\r\nof the qualifications of its members. But what a spectacle we here\r\npresent! We degrade and disgrace ourselves; we degrade and disgrace our\r\nconstituents and the country. We do not, and cannot organize; and why?\r\nBecause the Clerk of this House, the mere Clerk, whom we create, whom we\r\nemploy, and whose existence depends upon our will, usurps the throne, and\r\nsets us, the Representatives, the vicegerents of the whole American\r\npeople, at defiance, and holds us in contempt! And what is this Clerk of\r\nyours? Is he to control the destinies of sixteen millions of freemen? Is\r\nhe to suspend, by his mere negative, the functions of Government, and put\r\nan end to this Congress? He refuses to call the roll! It is in your power\r\nto compel him to call it, if he will not do it voluntarily. [Here he was\r\ninterrupted by a member, who said that he was authorized to say that\r\ncompulsion could not reach the Clerk, who had avowed that he would resign,\r\nrather than call the State of New Jersey.] Well, sir, then let him\r\nresign,\" continued Mr. Adams, \"and we may possibly discover some way by\r\nwhich we can get along, without the aid of his all-powerful talent,\r\nlearning and genius. If we cannot organize in any other way--if this Clerk\r\nof yours will not consent to our discharging the trusts confided to us by\r\nour constituents, then let us imitate the example of the Virginia House of\r\nBurgesses, which, when the colonial Governor Dinwiddie ordered it to\r\ndisperse, refused to obey the imperious and insulting mandate, and, like\r\nmen--\"\r\n\r\nThe multitude could not contain or repress their enthusiasm any longer,\r\nbut saluted the eloquent and indignant speaker, and intercepted him with\r\nloud and deafening cheers, which seemed to shake the capitol to its\r\ncentre. The very Genii of applause and enthusiasm seemed to float in the\r\natmosphere of the Hall, and every heart expanded with an indescribable\r\nfeeling of pride and exultation. The turmoil, the darkness, the very\r\n\"chaos of anarchy,\" which had, for three successive days, pervaded the\r\nAmerican Congress, was dispelled by the magic, the talismanic eloquence of\r\na single man; and, once more the wheels of Government and of Legislation\r\nwere put in motion.[Footnote: Reminiscences--by an Old Colony Man.]\r\n\r\nHaving, by this powerful appeal, brought the yet unorganized assembly to a\r\nperception of its hazardous position, he submitted a motion requiring the\r\nacting Clerk to proceed in calling the roll. This and similar motions had\r\nalready been made by other members. The difficulty was, that the acting\r\nClerk declined to entertain them. Accordingly, Mr. Adams was immediately\r\ninterrupted by a burst of voices demanding, \"How shall the question be\r\nput?\" \"Who will put the question?\" The voice of Mr. Adams was heard above\r\nthe tumult, \"I intend to put the question myself!\" That word brought order\r\nout of chaos. There was the master mind.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the multitude had recovered itself, and the excitement of\r\nirrepressible enthusiasm had abated, Mr. Richard Barnwell Rhett, of\r\nSouth Carolina, leaped upon one of the desks, waved his hand, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I move that the Honorable John Quincy Adams take the chair of the Speaker\r\nof this House, and officiate as presiding officer, till the House be\r\norganized by the election of its constitutional officers! As many as are\r\nagreed to this will say ay; those--\"\r\n\r\nHe had not an opportunity to complete the sentence--\"those who are not\r\nagreed, will say no,\"--for one universal, deafening, thundering ay,\r\nresponded to the nomination.\r\n\r\nHereupon, it was moved and ordered that Lewis Williams, of North Carolina,\r\nand Richard Barnwell Rhett, conduct John Quincy Adams to the chair.\r\n\r\nWell did Mr. Wise, of Virginia, say, \"Sir, I regard it as the proudest\r\nhour of your life; and if, when you shall be gathered to your fathers, I\r\nwere asked to select the words which, in my judgment, are best calculated\r\nto give at once the character of the man, I would inscribe upon your tomb\r\nthis sentence, 'I will put the question myself.'\" [Footnote: In a public\r\naddress, Mr. Adams once quoted the well known words of Tacitus, Annal.\r\nvi. 39--\"Par negotiis neque supra\"--applying them to a distinguished\r\nman, lately deceased. A lady wrote to inquire whence they came. Mr. Adams\r\ninformed her, and added, that they could not be adequately translated in\r\nless than seven words in English. The lady replied that they might be well\r\ntranslated in five--Equal to, not above, duty--but better in three--JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS.--Massachusetts Quarterly Review.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' FIRMNESS IN DISCHARGE OF DUTY--HIS EXERTIONS IN BEHALF OF THE\r\nAMISTAD SLAVES--HIS CONNEXION WITH THE SMITHSONIAN BEQUEST--TOUR THROUGH\r\nCANADA AND NEW YORK--HIS RECEPTION AT BUFFALO--VISITS NIAGARA\r\nFALLS--ATTENDS WORSHIP WITH THE TUSCARORA INDIANS--HIS RECEPTION AT\r\nROCHESTER--AT AUBURN--AT ALBANY--AT PITTSFIELD--VISITS CINCINNATI--ASSISTS\r\nIN LAYING THE CORNER STONE OF AN OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, in the limit prescribed to these pages, to detail\r\nthe numerous scenes and occurrences of a momentous nature, in which Mr.\r\nAdams took a prominent part during his services in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The path he marked out for himself at the commencement of\r\nhis congressional career, was pursued with unfaltering fidelity to the\r\nclose of life. His was the rare honor of devoting himself, unreservedly,\r\nto his legitimate duties as a Representative of the people while in\r\nCongress, and to nothing else. He believed the halls of the Capitol were\r\nno place for political intrigue; and that a member of Congress, instead of\r\nstudying to shape his course to make political capital or to subserve\r\nparty ends, should devote himself rigidly and solely to the interests of\r\nhis constituents.  His practice corresponded with his theory. His\r\nspeeches, his votes, his entire labors in Congress, were confined strictly\r\nto practical subjects, vitally connected with the great interests of our\r\ncommon country, and had no political or party bearing, other than such as\r\ntruth and public good might possess.\r\n\r\nHis hostility to slavery and the assumptions and usurpations of slave\r\npower in the councils of the nation, continued to the day of his death. At\r\nthe commencement of each session of Congress, he demanded that the\r\ninfamous \"gag rule,\" which forbid the presentation of petitions on the\r\nsubject of slavery, should be abolished. But despite its continuance, he\r\npersisted in handing in petitions from the people of every class,\r\ncomplexion and condition. He did not hesitate to lay before the House of\r\nRepresentatives a petition from Haverhill, Mass., for the dissolution of\r\nthe Union! Although opposed in his whole soul to the prayer of the\r\npetitioners, yet he believed himself sacredly bound to listen with due\r\nrespect to every request of the people, when couched in respectful terms.\r\n\r\nIn vain did the supporters of slavery endeavor to arrest his course, and\r\nto seal his lips in silence. In vain did they threaten\r\nassassination--expulsion from the House--indictment before the grand jury\r\nof the District of Columbia. In vain did they declare that he should \"be\r\nmade amenable to another tribunal, [mob-law] and as an incendiary, be\r\nbrought to condign punishment.\" \"My life on it,\" said a southern member,\r\n\"if he presents that petition from slaves, we shall yet see him within the\r\nwalls of the penitentiary.\" All these attempts at brow-beating moved him\r\nnot a tittle. Firm he stood to his duty, despite the storms of angry\r\npassion which howled around him, and with withering rebukes repelled the\r\nassaults of hot-blooded opponents, as the proud old headland, jutting far\r\ninto ocean's bosom, tosses high, in worthless spray, the dark mountain\r\nbillows which in wrath beat upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Do the gentlemen from the South,\" said he, \"think they can frighten me by\r\ntheir threats? If that be their object, let me tell them, sir, they have\r\nmistaken their man. I am not to be frightened from the discharge of a\r\nsacred duty, by their indignation, by their violence, nor, sir, by all the\r\ngrand juries in the universe. I have done only my duty; and I shall do it\r\nagain under the same circumstances, even though they recur to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Though aged, he was so iron of limb,\r\n   None of the youth could cope with him;\r\n   And the foes whom he singly kept at bay,\r\n   Outnumbered his thin hairs of silver grey.\"\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Adams without encouragement in his trying position. His\r\nimmediate constituents, at their primary meetings, repeatedly sent up a\r\ncheering voice in strong and earnest resolutions, approving heartily his\r\ncourse, and urging him to, perseverance therein. The Legislatures of\r\nMassachusetts and Vermont, rallied to his support. In solemn convocation,\r\nthey protested against the virtual annihilation of the right of\r\npetition--against slavery and the slave trade in the District of\r\nColumbia--gave their entire sanction to the principles advocated by Mr.\r\nAdams, and pledged their countenance to all measures calculated to sustain\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLarge bodies of people in the Eastern, Northern, and Middle States,\r\nsympathized with him in his support of the most sacred of privileges\r\nbestowed on man. Representative after Representative were sent to\r\nCongress, who gathered around him, and co-operated with him in his holy\r\nwarfare against the iron rule which slavery had been enabled to establish\r\nin the national Legislature. With renewed energy he resisted the mighty\r\ncurrent which was undermining the foundations of the Republic, and bearing\r\naway upon its turbid waters the liberties of the people. And he resisted\r\nnot in vain.\r\n\r\nThe brave old man lived to see his labors, in this department of duty,\r\ncrowned with abundant success. One after another the cohorts of slavery\r\ngave way before the incessant assaults, the unwearied perseverance, of Mr.\r\nAdams, and the faithful compeers who were sent by the people to his\r\nsupport. At length, in 1845, the obnoxious \"gag rule\" was rescinded, and\r\nCongress consented to receive, and treat respectfully, all petitions on\r\nthe subject of slavery. This was a moral triumph which amply compensated\r\nMr. Adams for all the labors he had put forth, and for all the trials he\r\nhad endured to achieve it.\r\n\r\nYes; he \"lived to hear that subject which of all others had been forbidden\r\nan entrance into the Halls of Congress, fairly broached. He lived to\r\nlisten, with a delight all his own, to a high-souled, whole-hearted\r\nspeech on the slave question, from his colleague, Mr. Palfrey--a speech,\r\nof which it is not too high praise to say, that it would not have\r\ndisparaged the exalted reputation of Mr. Adams, had he made it himself.\r\nAye, more, he lived to see the whole House of Representatives--the members\r\nfrom the South, not less than those from the North, attentive and\r\nrespectful listeners to that speech of an hour's length, on the political\r\nas well as moral aspect of slavery in this Republic. What a triumph! At\r\nthe close of it, the moral conqueror exclaimed, 'God be praised; the seals\r\nare broken, the door is open.'\" [Footnote: Rev. S. J. May.]\r\n\r\nIf anything were wanting to crown the fame of Mr. Adams, in the Last days\r\nof life, with imperishable honor, or to add, if possible, new brilliancy\r\nto the beams of his setting sun, it is found in his advocacy of the\r\nfreedom of the Amistad slaves.\r\n\r\nA ship-load of negroes had been stolen from Africa, contrary to the law\r\nof nations, of humanity and of God, and surreptitiously smuggled, in the\r\nnight, into the Island of Cuba. This act was piracy, according to the law\r\nof Spain, and of all Governments in Christendom, and the perpetrators\r\nthereof, had they been detected, would have been punished with death.\r\nImmediately after the landing of these unfortunate Africans, about\r\nthirty-six of them were purchased of the slave-pirates, by two Spaniards\r\nnamed Don Jose Ruiz and Don Pedro Montes, who shipped them for Guanaja,\r\nCuba, in the schooner \"Amistad.\" When three days out from Havana, the\r\nAfricans rose, killed the captain and crew, and took possession of the\r\nvessel--sparing the lives of their purchaser's, Ruiz and Montes. This\r\ntransaction was unquestionably justifiable on the part of the negroes.\r\nThey had been stolen from their native land--had fallen into the hands of\r\npirates and robbers, and reduced to abject slavery. According to the first\r\nlaw of nature--the law of self-defence--implanted in the bosom of every\r\nhuman being by the Creator, they were justified in taking any measures\r\nnecessary to restore them to the enjoyment of that freedom which was\r\ntheirs by birthright.\r\n\r\nThe negroes being unable to manage the schooner, compelled Ruiz and\r\nMontes to navigate her, and directed them to shape her course for Africa;\r\nfor it was their design to return to their native land. But they were\r\ndeceived by the two Spaniards, who brought the schooner to the coast of\r\nthe United States, where she was taken possession of by Lieut. Gedney, of\r\nthe U. S. surveying brig Washington, a few miles off Montauk Point, and\r\nbrought into New London, Conn., The two Spaniards claimed the Africans as\r\ntheir property; and the Spanish Minister demanded of the President of the\r\nUnited States, that they be delivered up to the proper authorities, and\r\ntaken back to Havana, to be tried for piracy and murder. The matter was\r\nbrought before the District Court of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time President Van Buren ordered the U. S. schooner Grampus,\r\nLieut. John S. Paine, to repair to New Haven, to be in readiness to convey\r\nthe Africans to Havana, should such be the decision of the Court. But the\r\nCourt decided that the Government of the United States had no authority to\r\nreturn them into slavery; and directed that they be conveyed in one of our\r\npublic ships to the shores of Africa, from whence they had but recently\r\nbeen torn away. From this decision the U. S. District Attorney appealed to\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese transactions attracted the attention of the whole people of the\r\nUnion, and naturally excited the sympathy of the masses, pro and con, as\r\nthey were favorable or unfavorable to the institution of slavery. Who\r\nshould defend, in the Supreme Court, these poor outcasts--ignorant,\r\ndegraded, wretched--who, fired with a noble energy, had burst the shackles\r\nof slavery, and by a wave of fortune had been thrown into the midst of a\r\npeople professing freedom, yet keeping their feet on the necks of millions\r\nof slaves? The eyes of all the friends of human rights turned\r\ninstinctively to JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. Nor were their expectations\r\ndisappointed. Without hesitation he espoused the cause of the Amistad\r\nnegroes. At the age of seventy-four, he appeared in the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States to advocate their cause. He entered upon this labor with\r\nthe enthusiasm of a youthful barrister, and displayed forensic talents, a\r\ncritical knowledge of law, and of the inalienable rights of man, which\r\nwould have added to the renown of the most eminent jurists of the day.\r\n\r\n\"When he went to the Supreme Court, after an absence of thirty years, and\r\narose to defend a body of friendless negroes, torn from their home and\r\nmost unjustly held in thrall--when he asked the Judges to excuse him at\r\nonce both for the trembling faults of age and the inexperience of youth,\r\nhaving labored so long elsewhere that he had forgotten the rules of\r\ncourt--when he summed up the conclusion of the whole matter, and brought\r\nbefore those judicial but yet moistening eyes, the great men whom he had\r\nonce met there--Chase, Cushing, Martin, Livingston, and Marshal himself;\r\nand while he remembered that they were 'gone, gone, all gone,' remembered\r\nalso the eternal Justice that is never gone--the sight was sublime. It was\r\nnot an old patrician of Rome, who had been Consul, Dictator, coming out of\r\nhis honored retirement at the Senate's call, to stand in the Forum to levy\r\nnew armies, marshal them to victory afresh, and gain thereby new laurels\r\nfor his brow; but it was a plain citizen of America, who had held an\r\noffice far greater than that of Consul, King, or Dictator, his hand\r\nreddened by no man's blood, expecting no honors, but coming in the name of\r\njustice, to plead for the slave, for the poor barbarian negro of Africa,\r\nfor Cinque and Grabbo for their deeds comparing them to Harmodius and\r\nAristogeiton, whose classic memory made each bosom thrill. That was worth\r\nall his honors--it was worth while to live fourscore years for that.\"\r\n[Footnote: Theodore Parker.]\r\n\r\nThis effort of Mr. Adams was crowned with complete success. The Supreme\r\nCourt decided that the Africans were entitled to their freedom, and\r\nordered them to be liberated. In due time they were enabled, by the\r\nassistance of the charitable, to sail for Africa, and take with them many\r\nof the implements of civilized life. They arrived in safety at Sierre\r\nLeone, and were allowed once more to mingle with their friends, and enjoy\r\nGod's gift of freedom, in a Pagan land--having fortunately escaped from a\r\ncruel and life-long bondage, in the midst of a Christian people.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a letter requesting Mr. Adams to write out his argument in\r\nthis case, he concludes as follows: \"I shall endeavor, as you desire, to\r\nwrite out, in full extent, my argument before the Court, in which all this\r\nwas noticed and commented upon. If it has no other effect, I hope it will\r\nat least have that of admonishing the free people of this Union to keep\r\nperpetually watchful eyes upon every act of their executive\r\nadministration, having any relation to the subject of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nIn availing the country of the benefit of the \"Smithsonian Bequest,\" and\r\nin founding the \"Smithsonian Institute\" at Washington, Mr. Adams took an\r\nactive part. He repeatedly called the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject, until he succeeded in causing a bill to be passed providing for\r\nthe establishment of the Institute. He was appointed one of the Regents of\r\nthe Institute, which office he held until his death.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1843, Mr. Adams visited Lebanon Springs, N. Y., for the\r\nbenefit of his health, which had become somewhat impaired, and also the\r\nhealth of a cherished member of his family. He designed to devote only\r\nfour or five days to this journey; but he was so highly pleased with the\r\nsmall portion of the State of New York he saw at Lebanon Springs, that he\r\nwas induced to proceed further. He visited Saratoga, Lake Georgia, Lower\r\nCanada, Montreal and Quebec. Returning, he ascended the St. Lawrence and\r\nthe Lakes as far as Niagara Falls and Buffalo, and by the way of\r\nRochester, Auburn, Utica and Albany, sought his home in Quincy with health\r\ngreatly improved.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Adams had many bitter enemies--made so by his fearless\r\nindependence, and the stern integrity with which he discharged the public\r\nduties entrusted to him--yet in the hearts of the people he ever occupied\r\nthe highest position. They not only respected and admired the politician,\r\nthe statesman, but they venerated the MAN! they loved him for his purity,\r\nhis philanthropy, his disinterested patriotism, his devotion to freedom\r\nand human rights. All this was manifested during his tour through New\r\nYork. It was marked in its whole extent by demonstrations of the highest\r\nattention and respect from people of all parties. Public greetings,\r\nprocessions, celebrations, met him and accompanied him at every step of\r\nhis journey. Never since the visit of La Fayette, had such an anxious\r\ndesire to honor a great and good man been manifested by the entire mass of\r\nthe people. His progress was one continued triumphal procession. \"I may\r\nsay,\" exclaimed Mr. Adams, near the close of his tour, \"without being\r\ncharged with pride or vanity, I have come not alone, for the whole people\r\nof the State of New York have been my companions!\"\r\n\r\nAt Buffalo he was received with every possible demonstration of respect.\r\nThe national ensign was streaming from an hundred masts, and the wharves,\r\nand the decks and rigging of the vessels, were crowded by thousands\r\nanxious to catch a glimpse of the renowned statesman and patriot, who was\r\ngreeted by repeated cheers. Hon. Millard Fillmore addressed him with\r\ngreat eloquence. The following is the conclusion of his speech:--\r\n\r\n\"You see around you, sir, no political partisans seeking to promote some\r\nsinister purpose; but you see here assembled the people of our infant\r\ncity, without distinction of party, sex, age, or condition--all, all\r\nanxiously vieing with each other to show their respect and esteem for\r\nyour public services and private worth. Here are gathered, in this vast\r\nmultitude of what must appear to you strange faces, thousands whose hearts\r\nhave vibrated to the chord of sympathy which your written speeches have\r\ntouched. Here is reflecting age, and ardent youth, and lisping childhood,\r\nto all of whom your venerated name is as dear as household words all\r\nanxious to feast their eyes by a sight of that extraordinary and venerable\r\nman, of whom they have heard, and read, and thought so much--all anxious\r\nto hear the voice of that 'old man eloquent,' on whose lips wisdom has\r\ndistilled her choicest nectar. Here, sir, you see them all, and read in\r\ntheir eager and joy-gladdened countenances, and brightly-beaming eyes, a\r\nwelcome--a thrice-told, heart-felt, soul-stirring welcome to 'the man whom\r\nthey delight to honor.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams responded to this speech in a strain of most interesting\r\nremarks. He commenced as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I must request your indulgence for a moment's pause to take breath. If\r\nyou inquire why I ask this indulgence, it is because I am so overpowered\r\nby the eloquence of my friend, the chairman of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, (whom I have been so long accustomed to refer to in that capacity,\r\nthat, with your permission, I will continue so to denominate him now,)\r\nthat I have no words left to answer him. For so liberal has he been in\r\nbestowing that eloquence upon me which he himself possesses in so eminent\r\na degree, that while he was ascribing to me talents so far above my own\r\nconsciousness in that regard, I was all the time imploring the god of\r\neloquence to give me, at least at this moment, a few words to justify him\r\nbefore you in making that splendid panegyric which he has been pleased to\r\nbestow upon me; and that the flattering picture which he has presented to\r\nyou, may not immediately be defaced before your eyes by what you should\r\nhear from me. * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn concluding his remarks he said:--\"Of your attachment to moral principle\r\nI have this day had another and pleasing proof in the dinner of which I\r\nhave partaken in the steamer, in which, by your kindness, I have been\r\nconveyed to this place. It was a sumptuous dinner, but at which temperance\r\nwas the presiding power. I congratulate you on the evidence there\r\nexhibited of your attachment to moral principle, in your co-operation in\r\nthat great movement which is promoting the happiness and elevation of man\r\nin every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"And here you will permit me to allude to an incident which has occurred\r\nin my recent visit to Canada, in which I perceived the cooperation of the\r\npeople of that Province in the same great moral reformation. While at\r\nQuebec, I visited the falls of Montmorenci, a cataract which, but for\r\nyours, would be among the greatest wonders of nature. In going to it, I\r\npassed through the parish of Beauport, and there, by the side of the way,\r\nI saw a column with an inscription upon its pedestal, which I had the\r\ncuriosity to stop and read. It was erected by the people of Beauport in\r\ngratitude to the Virgin, for her goodness in promoting the cause of\r\ntemperance in that parish. Perhaps I do not sufficiently sympathize with\r\nthe people of Beauport in attributing to the Virgin so direct an influence\r\nupon this moral reform; but in the spirit with which they erected that\r\nmonument I do most cordially sympathize with them. For, under whatever\r\ninfluence the cause may be promoted, the cause itself can never fail to\r\nmake its votaries wiser and better men. I cannot make a speech. My heart\r\nis too full, and my voice too feeble. Farewell! And with that farewell;\r\nmay the blessings of heaven be upon you throughout your lives!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was greatly delighted with his visit to Niagara Falls. A\r\nletter-writer thus describes it:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams seems incapable of fatigue, either physical or mental. After a\r\ndrive in the morning to Lewiston, he stopped, on his return to the Falls,\r\nat the whirlpool. The descent to the water's edge, which is not often\r\nmade, is, as you will remember, all but vertical, down a steep of some\r\nthree hundred and sixty feet. One of the party was about going down, when\r\nMr. Adams remarked that he would accompany him. Gen. Porter and the other\r\ngentlemen present remonstrated, and told him it was a very severe\r\nundertaking for a young and hearty man, and that he would find it, in such\r\na hot day, quite impracticable. He seemed, however, to know his\r\ncapacities; and this old man, verging on four score years, not only made\r\nthe descent, but clambered over almost impracticable rocks along the\r\nmargin of the river, to obtain the various views presented at different\r\npoints. The return was not easy, but he was quite adequate to the labor;\r\nand after resting a few minutes at the summit, resumed his ride, full of\r\nspirits and of animated and instructive conversation. After dinner, he\r\ncrossed over to Goat Island, and beheld the cataract from the various\r\npoints, and continued his explorations until all was obscured by darkness.\r\nHe seemed greatly impressed by the wonderful contrast presented by the\r\nscene of rage and repose--of the wild and furious dashing of the mighty\r\nriver down the rapids, with its mad plunge over the precipice--and the\r\nsullen stillness of the abyss of waters below. I wish I could repeat to\r\nyou his striking conversation during these rambles, replete with brilliant\r\nclassical allusions, historical illustrations, and the most minute, and as\r\nit seemed to me, universal information. * * * * * * I sincerely concur\r\nwith the worthy captain of one of our steamboats, who said to me the other\r\nday,--'Oh, that we could take the engine out of the old \"Adams,\" and put\r\nit into a new hull!'\"\r\n\r\nDuring his visit at the Falls, Mr. Adams, on a Sabbath morning,\r\naccompanied by Gen. Porter, visited the remnant of the Tuscarora Indians,\r\nand attended divine service in their midst. At the conclusion of the\r\nsermon, Mr. Adams made a brief address to the Indians, which is thus\r\ndescribed by the letter-writer alluded to above:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams alluded to his advanced age, and said this was the first time\r\nhe had ever looked upon their beautiful fields and forests--that he was\r\ntruly happy to meet them there and join with them in the worship of our\r\ncommon Parent--reminded them that in years past he had addressed them from\r\nthe position which he then occupied, in language, at once that of his\r\nstation and his heart, as 'his children'--and that now, as a private\r\ncitizen, he hailed them in terms of equal warmth and endearment, as his\r\n'brethren and sisters.' He alluded, with a simple eloquence which seemed\r\nto move the Indians much, to the equal care and love with which God\r\nregards all his children, whether savage or civilized, and to the common\r\ndestiny which awaits them hereafter, however various their lot here. He\r\ntouched briefly and forcibly on the topics of the sermon which they had\r\nheard, and concluded with a beautiful and touching benediction upon them.\"\r\n\r\nAt Rochester immense multitudes assembled to receive Mr. Adams. He was\r\nwelcomed in an eloquent address from the Mayor of the city. The following\r\nare a few extracts from the reply of Mr. Adams:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens:--I fear you expect from me a speech. If it\r\nwere in my power, oppressed as I am with mingled astonishment and\r\ngratitude at what I have experienced and now see of your kindness, to make\r\na speech, I would gratify you with one adorned with all the chaste yet\r\nsimple eloquence which are combined in the address to which you have just\r\nlistened from your worthy Mayor. But it is not in my power. You may\r\nprobably think there is some affectation on my part, in pretending\r\ninability to address you, knowing as many of you do, that I have often\r\naddressed assemblies like this. But I hope for greater indulgence from you\r\nthan this. I trust you will consider that I have seen and spoken to\r\nmultitudes like that now before me, but that these multitudes had frowning\r\nfaces. Those I could meet, and to those I could speak. But to you, whose\r\nevery face is expressive of generous affection--to you, in whose every\r\ncountenance I see kindness and friendship--I cannot speak. It is too much\r\nfor me. It overcomes my powers of speech. It is a new scene to me.\r\n\r\n* * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the sentiments which I have expressed, and the observations which\r\nI have made during my brief tour through this portion of your State, it\r\nwas impossible for me to forego a constant comparison with what New York\r\nwas in other days, and what it is now. I first set my feet upon the soil\r\nof the now Empire State, in 1785. I then visited the city of New York,--at\r\nthat time a town of 18,000 inhabitants. I tarried, while in that city, at\r\nthe house of John Jay--a man whom I name, and whom all will remember, as\r\none of the most illustrious of the distinguished patriots who carried our\r\nbeloved country through the dark period of the Revolution. Mr. Jay, the\r\nSecretary of Foreign Affairs, under the Congress of the Federation, was\r\nlaying the foundation of a house in Broadway, but which was separated by\r\nthe distance of a quarter of a mile from any other dwelling. At that time,\r\nbeing eighteen years of age, I received an invitation to visit western New\r\nYork; and I have regretted often, but never more than now, that I had not\r\naccepted that invitation. Oh! what would I not have given to have seen\r\nthis part of this great State then, that I might be able to contrast it\r\nwith what it now is. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"It has seemed to me as if in this region the God of nature intended to\r\nmake a more sublime display of his power, than in any other portion of the\r\nworld. He has done so in physical nature--in the majestic cataract, whose\r\nsound you can almost hear--in forest and in field--in the mind of man\r\namong you, In what has been accomplished to make your city what it is, the\r\naged have done the most. The middle aged may say we will improve upon what\r\nhas been done; and the young, we shall accomplish still more than our\r\nfathers. That, fellow-citizens, was the boast in the ancient Spartan\r\nprocession--a procession which was divided into three classes--the old,\r\nthe middle-aged, and the young. They had a saying which each class\r\nrepeated in turn. The aged said--\r\n\r\n  'We have been, in days of old,\r\n   Wise and gentle, brave and bold.'\r\n\r\nThe middle-aged said--\r\n\r\n  'We, in turn, your place supply;\r\n   Who doubts it, let them come and try.'\r\n\r\nAnd the boys said--\r\n\r\n  'Hereafter, at our country's call,\r\n   We promise to surpass you all.'\r\n\r\nAnd so it will be with you--each in your order.\"\r\n\r\nAt Auburn every possible token of respect was paid to the venerable\r\nstatesman. A committee consisting of ex-Gov. Seward, Judge Conklin,\r\nJudge Miller, Luman Sherwood, P. H. Perry, S. A. Goodwin, James C. Wood,\r\nand J. L. Doty, Esqs., proceeded to Canandaigua to meet Mr. Adams. At\r\nhalf past nine o'clock in the evening, Mr. Adams, accompanied by the\r\ncommittee, arrived in Auburn. He was received by a torch-light procession,\r\ncomposed of the Auburn Guards, the Firemen, and an immense concourse of\r\ncitizens, and conducted to the mansion of Gov. Seward, where he thus\r\nbriefly addressed the people:--\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens:--Notwithstanding the glow with which these brilliant\r\ntorch-lights illuminate my welcome among you, I can only acknowledge your\r\nkindness, on this occasion, by assuring you that to-morrow morning, by the\r\nlight of the blessed sun, I hope to take everyone of you by the hand, and\r\nexpress feelings too strong for immediate utterance.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following morning at six o'clock, Mr. Adams visited the State\r\nPrison, and made many inquiries concerning the discipline of the prison,\r\nand its success in the prevention of crime and reformation of offenders.\r\nAt 9 o'clock he met the citizens in the First Presbyterian church, where\r\nhe was addressed by Gov. Seward, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--I am charged with the very honorable and most agreeable duty, of\r\nexpressing to you the reverence and affectionate esteem of my\r\nfellow-citizens, assembled in your presence.\r\n\r\n\"A change has come over the spirit of your journey, since your steps have\r\nturned towards your ancestral sea-side home. An excursion to invigorate\r\nhealth impaired by labors, too arduous for age, in the public councils,\r\nand expected to be quiet and contemplative, has become one of fatigue and\r\nexcitement. Rumors of your advance escape before you, and a happy and\r\ngrateful community rise up in their clustering cities, towns, and\r\nvillages, impede your way with demonstrations of respect and kindness, and\r\nconvert your unpretending journey into a triumphal progress. Such honors\r\nfrequently attend public functionaries, and such an one may sometimes find\r\nit difficult to determine how much of the homage he receives is paid to\r\nhis own worth, how much proceeds from the habitual reverence of good\r\nrepublican citizens to constituted elective authority, and how much from\r\nthe spirit of venal adulation.\r\n\r\n\"You, sir, labor under no such embarrassment. The office you hold, though\r\nhonorable, is purely legislative, and such as we can bestow by our\r\nimmediate suffrage on one of ourselves. You conferred personal benefits\r\nsparingly when you held the patronage of the nation. That patronage you\r\nhave relinquished, and can never regain. Your hands will be uplifted\r\noften, during your remaining days, to invoke blessings on your country,\r\nbut never again to distribute honors or reward among your countrymen. The\r\nhomage paid you, dear sir, is sincere, for it has its sources in the just\r\nsentiments and irrepressible affections of a free people, their love of\r\ntruth, their admiration of wisdom, their reverence for virtue, and their\r\ngratitude for beneficence.\r\n\r\n\"Nor need you fear that enthusiasm exaggerates your title to the public\r\nregard. Your fellow-citizens, in spite of political prudence, could not\r\navoid honoring you on grounds altogether irrespective of personal merit.\r\nJohn Adams, who has gone to receive the reward of the just, was one of the\r\nmost efficient and illustrious founders of this Empire, and afterwards its\r\nChief Ruler. The son of such a father would, in any other age, and even in\r\nthis age, in any other country than this, have been entitled, by birth\r\nalone, to a sceptre. We not merely deny hereditary claims to civil trust,\r\nbut regard even hereditary distinction with jealousy. And this\r\ncircumstance enhances justly the estimate of your worth. For when before\r\nhas it happened that in such a condition of society the son has, by mere\r\ncivic achievement, attained the eminence of such a sire, and effaced\r\nremembrance of birth by justly acquired renown?\r\n\r\n\"The hand we now so eagerly grasp, was pressed in confidence and\r\nfriendship by the Father of our Country. The wreath we place on your\r\nhonored brow, received its earliest leaves from the hand of Washington. We\r\ncannot expect, with the agency of free and universal suffrage, to be\r\nalways governed by the wise and the good. But surely your predecessors in\r\nthe Chief Magistracy, were men such as never before successively wielded\r\npower in any State. They differed in policy as they must, and yet,\r\nthroughout their several dynasties, without any sacrifice of personal\r\nindependence, and while passing from immature youth to ripened age, you\r\nwere counsellor and minister to them all. We seem therefore, in this\r\ninterview with you, to come into the presence of our departed chiefs; the\r\nmajestic shade of Washington looks down upon us; we hear the bold and\r\nmanly eloquence of the elder Adams; and we listen to the voices of the\r\nphilosophic and sagacious Jefferson, the refined and modest Madison, and\r\nthe generous and faithful Monroe.\r\n\r\n\"A life of such eminent patriotism and fidelity found its proper reward in\r\nyour elevation to the eminence from which you had justly derived so many\r\nhonors. Although your administration of the government is yet too recent\r\nfor impartial history, or unbounded eulogy, our grateful remembrance of it\r\nis evinced by the congratulations you now receive from your\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\"But your claims to the veneration of your countrymen do not end here.\r\nYour predecessors descended from the Chief Magistracy to enjoy, in repose\r\nand tranquillity, honors even greater than those which belonged to that\r\neminent station. It was reserved for you to illustrate the important\r\ntruths, that offices and trusts are not the end of public service, but are\r\nmerely incidents in the life of the true American citizen; that duties\r\nremain when the highest trust is resigned; and that there is scope for a\r\npure and benevolent ambition beyond even the Presidency of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n\"You have devoted the energies of a mind unperverted, the learning and\r\nexperience acquired through more than sixty years, and even the influence\r\nand fame derived from your high career of public service, to the great\r\ncause of universal liberty. The praises we bestow are already echoed back\r\nto us by voices which come rich and full across the Atlantic, hailing you\r\nas the indefatigable champion of humanity--not the humanity which embraces\r\na single race or clime, but that humanity which regards the whole family\r\nof MAN. Such salutations as these cannot be mistaken. They come not from\r\nyour contemporaries, for they are gone--you are not of this generation,\r\nbut of the PAST, spared to hear the voice of POSTERITY. The greetings you\r\nreceive come up from the dark and uncertain FUTURE. They are the\r\nwhisperings of posthumous FAME--fame which impatiently awaits your\r\ndeparture, and which, spreading wider and growing more and more distinct,\r\nwill award to JOHN QUINCY ADAMS a name to live with that of WASHINGTON!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience expressed their sympathy with this address by long and\r\nenthusiastic cheering. When order was restored, Mr. Adams rose, evidently\r\nunder great and unaffected embarrassment.\r\n\r\nHe replied to the speech in an address of about half an hour, during which\r\nthe attention of his audience was riveted upon the speaker, with intense\r\ninterest and affection. He declared the embarrassment he felt in speaking.\r\nHe was sensible that his fellow-citizens had laid aside all partizan\r\nfeelings in coming up to greet him. He desired to speak what would not\r\nwound the feelings of anyone. He was grateful, deeply grateful, to them\r\nall. But on what subject of public interest could a public man speak, that\r\nwould find harmony among an intelligent, thinking people? There were such\r\nsubjects, but he could not speak of them.\r\n\r\nThe people of Western New York had always been eminently just and generous\r\nto him, and had recently proved their kindness on various occasions, by\r\ninviting him to address the State Agricultural Society on agriculture. But\r\nhis life had been spent in the closet, in diplomacy, or in the cabinet;\r\nand he had not learned the practice, or even the theory of agriculture.\r\nAfter what he had seen of the harvests of Western New York, bursting with\r\nfood for the sustenance of man, for him to address the people of such a\r\ndistrict on agriculture, would be as absurd as the vanity of the\r\nrhetorician who went to Carthage to instruct Hannibal in the art of war.\r\nHe had been solicited to address the young. In his life time he had been\r\nan instructor of youth, and, strange as from his present display they\r\nmight think it, he had instructed them in the art of eloquence. And there\r\nwas no more honorable office on earth than instructing the young. But the\r\nschools and seminaries had passed him, while he was engaged in other\r\npursuits; and for him now to attempt to instruct the young of this\r\ngeneration, would evince only the garrulousness of age.\r\n\r\nHe had been invited to discourse on internal improvement; but that was a\r\nsubject he feared to touch. On one point, however, all men agreed. All\r\nwere in favor of internal improvement. But there was a balance between the\r\nreasonable sacrifices of this generation, and the burden it had a right to\r\ncast upon posterity, and every individual might justly claim to hold his\r\nbalance for himself. One thing, however, he was sure he might assume with\r\nsafety. In looking over the State of New York, upon its canals and\r\nrailroads, which brought the borders of the State into contiguity, and its\r\ncitizens in every part into communion with each other, he was sure that\r\nall rejoiced, and might well glory in what had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nMr. A. said he had read and endeavored to inform himself concerning prison\r\ndiscipline, a subject deeply interesting to the peace, good order, and\r\nwelfare of society; but after his examination of the penitentiary here, he\r\nwas satisfied that he was yet a learner, instead of being able to give\r\ninstruction on that important subject.\r\n\r\nHe had been asked to enlist in the growing army of temperance, and\r\ndiscourse on that cause, so deeply cherished by every well wisher of our\r\ncountry. And he would cheerfully speak; but other and more devoted men had\r\noccupied the field, and what was left for him to say on temperance? In\r\npassing through Catholic Lower Canada he saw a column erected to the\r\nVirgin Mary, in gratitude for her promotion of the temperance cause. If\r\nindeed the blessed Virgin did lend her aid to that great work, it would\r\nalmost win him to worship at her shrine, although he belonged to that\r\nclass of people who rejected the invocation of saints.\r\n\r\nHe felt, therefore, that he had no subject on which to address them, but\r\nhimself and his own public life. The experience of an old man, related by\r\nhimself, would, he feared, be more irksome than profitable.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, am I to say? I am summoned here to speak, and to reply to\r\nwhat has been said to me by my respected friend, your late Chief\r\nMagistrate. And what is the theme he has given me? It is myself. And what\r\ncan I say on such a subject? To know that he entertains, or that you\r\nentertain for me the sentiments he has expressed, absolutely overpowers\r\nme. I cannot go on. The only answer I can make, is a declaration, that\r\nduring my public service, now protracted to nearly the age of eighty, I\r\nhave endeavored to serve my country honestly and faithfully. How\r\nimperfectly I have done this, none seem so sensible as myself. I must\r\nstop. I can only repeat thanks, thanks, thanks to you, one and all, and\r\nimplore the blessings of God upon you and your children.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this reply, Mr. Adams was introduced to a large\r\nnumber of the ladies and gentlemen assembled in the church. He then\r\nreturned to the American Hotel, where he remained an hour, receiving the\r\nvisits of the citizens of the adjoining towns. At 11 o'clock the Auburn\r\nGuards escorted Mr. Adams and the committee, followed by a large\r\nprocession, to the car-house. Accompanied by Gov. Seward, Judge Miller,\r\nHon. Christopher Morgan, the committee, Auburn Guards, and a number of the\r\ncitizens of Auburn, he was conveyed in an extra train of cars, in an hour\r\nand five minutes, to Syracuse.\r\n\r\nAt Syracuse, at Utica, at Albany, the same spontaneous outgushing\r\nmanifestations of respect and affection met him that had hitherto attended\r\nhis journey in every populous place through which he passed. In his reply\r\nto the address of Mr. Barnard, at Albany, he concluded in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"Lingering as I am on the stage of public life, and, as many of you may\r\nthink, lingering beyond the period when nature calls for repose--while I\r\nremain in the station which I now occupy in the Congress of the United\r\nStates, if you, my hearers, as an assembly, or if anyone among you, as an\r\nindividual, have any object or purpose to promote, or any end to secure\r\nthat he believes can in any way advance his interests or increase his\r\nhappiness, then, in the name of God, I ask you to send your petitions to\r\nme! (Tremendous cheering.) I hope this is not trespassing too far on\r\npolitics. (Laughter, and cheers.) I unhesitatingly promise you, one and\r\nall, that if I can in any way serve you in that station, I will do it most\r\ncheerfully; regarding it as the choicest blessing of God, if I shall thus\r\nbe enabled to make some just return for the kind attentions which you have\r\nthis day bestowed upon me.\"\r\n\r\nIn his route homeward, Mr. Adams was received and entertained in a very\r\nhandsome manner by the people of Pittsfield, Mass. He was addressed by\r\nHon. George N. Briggs, who alluded, in eloquent terms, to his long and\r\ndistinguished public services. Mr. Adams, in reply, spoke of the scenes\r\namidst which he had passed his early youth, and of the influence which\r\nthey exerted in forming his character and shaping his purposes. \"In 1775,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the minute men from a hundred towns in the province were\r\nmarching, at a moment's warning, to the scene of opening war. Many of them\r\ncalled at my father's house in Quincy, and received the hospitality of\r\nJohn Adams. All were lodged in the house which the house would contain;\r\nothers in the barns, and wherever they could find a place. There were then\r\nin my father's kitchen some dozen or two of pewter spoons; and I well\r\nrecollect going into the kitchen and seeing some of the men engaged in\r\nrunning those spoons into bullets for the use of the troops! Do you\r\nwonder,\" said he, \"that a boy of seven years of age, who witnessed this\r\nscene, should be a patriot?\"\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the same year, Mr. Adams received an invitation from the\r\nCincinnati Astronomical Society, to visit that city, and assist in the\r\nceremony of laying the corner stone of an observatory, to be erected on an\r\neminence called Mount Ida. The invitation was accepted. On his journey to\r\nCincinnati, the same demonstrations of respect, the same eagerness to\r\nhonor the aged patriarch were manifested in the various cities and towns\r\nthrough which he passed, as on his summer tour.\r\n\r\n324   LIFE OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of laying the corner stone took place on the 9th of November,\r\n1843. Mr. Adams delivered an address on the occasion, replete with\r\neloquence, wisdom, philosophy, and religion. The following beautiful\r\nextract will afford a specimen:--\r\n\r\n\"The various difficult, and, in many respects, opposite motives which have\r\nimpelled mankind to the study of the stars, have had a singular effect in\r\ncomplicating and confounding the recommendation of the science. Religion,\r\nidolatry, superstition, curiosity, the thirst for knowledge, the passion\r\nfor penetrating the secrets of nature, the warfare of the huntsman by\r\nnight and by day against the beast of the forest and of the field, the\r\nmeditations of the shepherd in the custody and wanderings of his flocks,\r\nthe influence of the revolving seasons of the year, and the successive\r\ngarniture of the firmament upon the labors of the husbandman, upon the\r\nseed time and the harvest, the blooming of flowers, the ripening of the\r\nvintage, the polar pilot of the navigator, and the mysterious magnet of\r\nthe mariner--all, in harmonious action, stimulate the child of earth and\r\nof heaven to interrogate the dazzling splendors of the sky, to reveal to\r\nhim the laws of their own existence.\r\n\r\n\"He has his own comforts, his own happiness, his own existence, identified\r\nwith theirs. He sees the Creator in creation, and calls upon creation to\r\ndeclare the glory of the Creator. When Pythagoras, the philosopher of the\r\nGrecian schools, conceived that more than earthly idea of 'the music of\r\nthe spheres'--when the great dramatist of nature could inspire the lips of\r\nhis lover on the moonlight green with the beloved of his soul, to say to\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n  'Sit, Jessica.--Look how the floor of Heaven\r\n   Is thick inlaid with pattens of bright gold!\r\n   There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest,\r\n   But in his motion like an angel sings,\r\n   Still choiring to the young eyed cherubim!'\r\n\r\n\"Oh, who is the one with a heart, but almost wishes to cast off this muddy\r\nvesture of decay, to be admitted to the joy of listening to the celestial\r\nharmony!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ADAMS' LAST APPEARANCE IN PUBLIC AT BOSTON--HIS HEALTH--LECTURES ON\r\nHIS JOURNEY TO WASHINGTON--REMOTE CAUSE OF HIS DECEASE--STRUCK WITH\r\nPARALYSIS--LEAVES QUINCY FOR WASHINGTON FOR THE LAST TIME--HIS FINAL\r\nSICKNESS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--HIS DEATH--THE FUNERAL AT\r\nWASHINGTON--REMOVAL OF THE BODY TO QUINCY--ITS INTERMENT.\r\n\r\nThe last time Mr. Adams appeared in public in Boston, he presided at a\r\nmeeting of the citizens of that city, in Faneuil Hall. \"A man had been\r\nkidnapped in Boston--kidnapped at noon-day, 'on the high road between\r\nFaneuil Hall and old Quincy,' and carried  off to be a slave! New England\r\nhands had seized their brother, sold him into bondage forever, and his\r\nchildren after him. A meeting was called to talk the matter over, in a\r\nplain way, and look in one another's faces. Who was fit to preside in such\r\na case? That old man sat in the chair in Faneuil Hall. Above him was the\r\nimage of his father and his own; around him were Hancock and the other\r\nAdams, and Washington, greatest of all. Before him were the men and women\r\nof Boston, met to consider the wrongs done to a miserable negro slave. The\r\nroof of the old Cradle of Liberty spanned over them all. Forty years\r\nbefore, a young man and a Senator, he had taken the chair at a meeting\r\ncalled to consult on the wrong done to American seamen, violently\r\nimpressed by the British from an American ship of war--the unlucky\r\nChesapeake. Now an old man, clothed with half a century of honors, he sits\r\nin the same Hall, to preside over a meeting to consider the outrage done\r\nto a single slave. One was the first meeting of citizens he ever presided\r\nover; the other was the last: both for the same object--the defence of\r\nthe eternal right!\" [Footnote: Theodore Parker.]\r\n\r\nFew men retain the health and vigor with which Mr. Adams was blessed in\r\nextreme old age. When most others are decrepit and helpless, he was in the\r\nenjoyment of meridian strength and energy, both of body and mind, and\r\ncould endure labors which would prostrate many in the prime of manhood. An\r\ninstance of his powers of endurance is furnished in his journey to\r\nWashington, to attend the opening of Congress, when in the 74th year of\r\nhis age. On Monday morning he left Boston, and the same evening delivered\r\na lecture before the Young Men's Institute, in Hartford, Conn. The next\r\nday he proceeded to New Haven, and in the evening lectured before a\r\nsimilar Institute in that city. Wednesday he pursued his journey to New\r\nYork, and in the evening lectured before the New York Lyceum, in the\r\nBroadway Tabernacle. Thursday evening he delivered an address before an\r\nassociation in Brooklyn; and on Friday evening delivered a second lecture\r\nbefore the New York Lyceum. Here were labors which would seriously tax the\r\nconstitution of vigorous youth; and yet Mr. Adams performed them with much\r\ncomparative ease.\r\n\r\nHis great longevity, and his general good health, must be attributed, in\r\nno small degree, to his abstemious and temperate habits, early rising, and\r\nactive exercise. He took pleasure in athletic amusements, and was\r\nexceedingly fond of walking. During his summer residence in Quincy, he has\r\nbeen known to walk to his son's residence in Boston (seven miles,) before\r\nbreakfast. \"While President of the United States, he was probably the\r\nfirst man up in Washington, lighted his own fire, and was hard at work in\r\nhis library, while sleep yet held in its obliviousness the great mass of\r\nhis fellow-citizens.\" He was an expert swimmer, and was in the constant\r\nhabit of bathing, whenever circumstances would permit. Not unfrequently\r\nthe first beams of the rising sun, as they fell upon the beautiful\r\nPotomac, would find Mr. Adams buffeting its waves with all the\r\nsportiveness and dexterity of boyhood, while a single attendant watched\r\nupon the shore. When in the Presidency, he sometimes made a journey from\r\nWashington to Quincy on horseback, as a simple citizen, accompanied only\r\nby a servant.\r\n\r\nMore than four score years had sprinkled their frosts upon his brow, and\r\nstill he was in the midst of his usefulness. Promptly at his post in the\r\nHall of Representatives stood the veteran sentinel, watching vigilantly\r\nover the interests of his country. With an eye undimmed by age, a quick\r\near, a ready hand, an intellect unimpaired, he guarded the citadel of\r\nliberty, ever on the alert to detect, and mighty to repel, the approach of\r\nthe foe, however covert or however open his attacks. Never did the Union,\r\nnever did freedom, the world, more need his services than now. A large\r\nterritory, of sufficient extent to form several States, had been blighted\r\nby slavery, and annexed to the United Sates. A sanguinary and expensive\r\nwar, growing out of this strengthening of the slave power, had just\r\nterminated, adding to the Union still larger territories--now free soil\r\nindeed, but furnishing a field for renewed battles between slavery and\r\nliberty. New revolutions were about to break forth in Europe, to convulse\r\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, and cause old thrones to totter and fall!\r\n\r\nHow momentous the era! How deeply fraught with the prosperity of the\r\nAmerican Republic--with the progress of man--the freedom of nations--the\r\nhappiness of succeeding generations! How could he, who for years had\r\nprominently and nobly stood forth, as the leader of the hosts contending\r\nfor the rights and the liberties of humanity, be spared from his post at\r\nsuch a juncture? Who could put on his armor?--who wield his weapons?--who\r\n\"lead a forlorn hope,\" or mount a deadly breach in battles which might yet\r\nbe waged between the sons of freedom and the propagators of slavery? But\r\nthe loss was to be experienced. A wise and good Providence had so ordered.\r\nThe sands of his life had run out. A voice from on high called him away\r\nfrom earth's stormy struggles, to bright and peaceful scenes in the spirit\r\nland. He could no longer tarry. Death found the faithful veteran at his\r\npost, with his harness on. How applicable the words of Scott, on the\r\ndeparture of Pitt:--\r\n\r\n  \"Hadst thou but lived, though stripp'd of power,\r\n   A watchman on the lonely tower,\r\n   Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,\r\n   When fraud or danger were at hand;\r\n   By thee, as by the beacon-light,\r\n   Our pilots had kept course aright;\r\n   As some proud column, though alone,\r\n   Thy strength had propp'd the tottering throne.\r\n   Now is the stately column broke,\r\n   The beacon-light is quenched in smoke,\r\n   The trumpet's silver sound is still,\r\n   The warder silent on the hill!\r\n   O think how, to his latest day,\r\n   When death, just hovering, claimed his prey,\r\n   With Palinure's unaltered mood,\r\n   Firm at his dangerous post he stood;\r\n   Each call for needful rest repell'd,\r\n   With dying hand the rudder held,\r\n   Till, in his fall, with fateful sway,\r\n   The steerage of the realm gave way.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some that the remote cause of Mr. Adams's death\r\nwas a severe injury he received by a fall in the House of Representatives,\r\nin June, 1840. The accident is thus described by an eye witness:--\r\n\r\n\"It had been a very warm day, and the debates had partaken of\r\nextraordinary excitement, when, a few moments before sunset, the House\r\nadjourned, and most of the members had sought relief from an oppressive\r\natmosphere, in the arbors and recesses of the adjoining Congressional\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n\"At that time I held a subordinate clerkship in the House, which usually\r\nconfined me, the larger portion of the day not devoted to debate, to one\r\nof the committee rooms; whilst the balance of the day I occupied as a\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams was always the first man in the House, and the last man out of\r\nit; and, as I usually detained myself an hour or more after adjournment,\r\nin writing up my notes, I often came in contact with him. He was pleased\r\nto call at my desk very often, before he went home, and indulge in some\r\nincidental, unimportant conversation. On the day referred to, just as the\r\nsun was setting, and was throwing his last rays through the murky hall, I\r\nlooked up, and saw Mr. Adams approaching. He had almost reached my desk,\r\nand had uplifted his hand in friendly salutation, when he pitched\r\nheadlong, some six or eight feet, and struck his head against the sharp\r\ncorner of an iron rail that defended one of the entrance aisles leading to\r\nthe circle within the bar, inflicting a heavy contusion on his forehead,\r\nand rendering him insensible. I instantly leaped from my seat, took the\r\nprostrate sufferer in my arms, and found that he was in a state of utter\r\nstupor and insensibility. Looking around for aid, I had the good fortune\r\nto find that Col. James Munroe, of the New York delegation, had just\r\nreturned to his desk to procure a paper he had forgotten, when, giving the\r\nalarm, he flew to the rescue, manifesting the deepest solicitude for the\r\nwelfare of the venerable statesman. Follansbee, the doorkeeper, with two\r\nor more of his pages, came in next; and after we had applied a plentiful\r\nsupply of cold water to the sufferer, he returned to consciousness, and\r\nrequested that he might be taken to his residence. In less than five\r\nminutes, Mr. Moses H. Grinnell, Mr. George H. Profit, Mr. Ogden Hoffman,\r\nand Col. Christopher Williams, of Tennessee, were called in, a carriage\r\nwas procured, and Mr. Adams was being conveyed to his residence in\r\nPresident Square, when, it being ascertained that his shoulder was\r\ndislocated, the carriage was stopped at the door of the private hotel of\r\nCol. Munroe, in Pennsylvania Avenue, between Eleventh and Twelfth\r\nstreets; the suffering, but not complaining statesman, was taken out, and\r\nsurgical aid instantly put in requisition. Doctor Sewall was sent for;\r\nwhen it was ascertained that the left shoulder-joint was out of the\r\nsocket; and, though Mr. Adams must have suffered intensely, he complained\r\nnot--did not utter a groan or a murmur.\r\n\r\n\"More than an hour elapsed before the dislocated limb could be adjusted;\r\nand to effect which, his arm endured, in a concentrated and continued\r\nwrench or pull, many minutes at a time, the united strength of Messrs.\r\nGrinnell, Munroe, Profit, and Hoffman. Still Mr. Adams uttered not a\r\nmurmur, though the great drops of sweat that rolled down his furrowed\r\ncheeks, or stood upon his brow, told but too well the physical agony he\r\nendured. As soon as his arm was adjusted, he insisted on being carried\r\nhome, and his wishes were complied with.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I was at the capitol at a very early hour, attending to\r\nsome writing. I thought of, and lamented the accident that had befallen\r\nMr. Adams, and had already commenced writing an account of it to a\r\ncorrespondent. At that instant I withdrew my eyes from the paper on which\r\nI was writing, and saw Mr. Adams standing a foot or two from me, carefully\r\nexamining the carpeting. 'Sir,' said he, 'I am looking for that place in\r\nthe matting that last night tripped me. If it be not fastened down, it may\r\nkill some one.' And then he continued his search for the trick-string\r\nmatting.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams after this accident did not enjoy as sound health as in previous\r\nyears, yet was more active and vigorous than the majority of those who\r\nattain to his age. But on the 20th of November, 1846, he experienced the\r\nfirst blow of the fatal disease which eventually terminated his existence.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of that day, while sojourning at the residence of his son,\r\nin Boston, preparing to depart for Washington, he was walking out with a\r\nfriend to visit a new Medical College, and was struck with paralysis by\r\nthe way. This affliction confined him several weeks, when he obtained\r\nsufficient strength to proceed to Washington, and enter upon his duties in\r\nthe House of Representatives. He viewed this attack as the touch of death.\r\nAn interregnum of nearly four months occurs in his journal. The next entry\r\nis under the head of \"Posthumous Memoir.\" After describing his recent\r\nsickness, he continues:--\"From that hour I date my decease, and consider\r\nmyself, for every useful purpose, to myself and fellow-creatures, dead;\r\nand hence I call this, and what I may hereafter write, a posthumous\r\nmemoir.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he was after this, regular in his attendance at the House of\r\nRepresentatives, yet he did not mingle as freely in debate as formerly. He\r\npassed the following summer, as usual, at his seat in Quincy. In November,\r\nhe left his native town for Washington, to return no more in life!\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 20th of February, 1848, he appeared in unusual health. In\r\nthe forenoon he attended public worship at the capitol, and in the\r\nafternoon at St. John's church. At nine o'clock in the evening he retired\r\nwith his wife to his library, where she read to him a sermon of Bishop\r\nWilberforce, on Time--\"hovering, as he was, on the verge of eternity!\"\r\nThis was the last night he passed beneath his own roof.\r\n\r\nMonday, the 21st, he rose at his usual very early hour, and engaged in his\r\naccustomed occupations with his pen. An extraordinary alacrity pervaded\r\nhis movements, and the cheerful step with which he ascended the steps of\r\nthe capitol was remarked by his attendants. He occupied a portion of the\r\nforenoon in composing a few stanzas of poetry, at the request of a friend,\r\nand had signed his name twice for members who desired to obtain his\r\nautograph.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase had introduced a resolution of thanks to Generals Twiggs,\r\nWorth, Quitman, Pillow, Shields, Pearce, Cadwalader, and Smith, for\r\ntheir services in the Mexican war, and awarding them gold medals. Mr.\r\nAdams was in his seat, and voted on the two questions preliminary to\r\nordering its engrossment, with an uncommonly emphatic tone of voice. About\r\nhalf past one o'clock, P. M., as the Speaker had risen to put another\r\nquestion to the House, the proceedings were suddenly interrupted by cries\r\nof \"Stop!--stop!--Mr. Adams!\" There was a quick movement towards the chair\r\nof Mr. Adams, by two or three members, and in a moment he was surrounded\r\nby a large number of Representatives, eagerly inquiring--\"What's the\r\nmatter?\"--\"Has he fainted?\"--\"Is he dead?\" JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, while\r\nfaithful at his post, and apparently about to rise to address the Speaker,\r\nhad sunk into a state of unconsciousness! He had been struck a second time\r\nwith paralysis. The scene was one of intense excitement. Pallor, anxiety,\r\nalarm, were depicted on every countenance. \"Take him out,\"--\"Bring\r\nwater,\"--exclaimed several voices. He had been prevented from falling to\r\nthe floor by a member from Ohio, whose seat was near his--Mr. Fisher--who\r\nreceived him in his arms. Immediately Mr. Grinnell, one of his colleagues\r\nfrom Massachusetts, was by his side, keeping off a press of anxious\r\nfriends, and bathing his face with iced water.\r\n\r\n\"He was immediately lifted into the area in front of the Clerk's table.\r\nThe Speaker instantly suggested that some gentleman move an adjournment,\r\nwhich being promptly done, the House adjourned. A sofa was brought, and\r\nMr. Adams, in a state of perfect helplessness, though not of entire\r\ninsensibility, was gently laid upon it. The sofa was then taken up and\r\nborne out of the Hall into the Rotunda, where it was set down, and the\r\nmembers of both Houses, and strangers, who were fast crowding around, were\r\nwith some difficulty repressed, and an open space cleared in its immediate\r\nvicinity; but a medical gentleman, a member of the House, (who was prompt,\r\nactive, and self-possessed throughout the whole painful scene,) advised\r\nthat he be removed to the door of the Rotunda opening on the east portico,\r\nwhere a fresh wind was blowing. This was done; but the air being chilly\r\nand loaded with vapor, the sofa was, at the suggestion of Mr. Winthrop,\r\nonce more taken up and removed to the Speaker's apartment, the doors of\r\nwhich were forthwith closed to all but professional gentlemen and\r\nparticular friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe features of the dying patriarch were almost as rigid as though in\r\ndeath: but there was a serenity in his countenance which betokened an\r\nabsence of pain. There were five physicians, members of the House,\r\npresent, viz.:--Drs. Newell, Fries, Edwards, Jones of Georgia, and Lord.\r\nThese gentlemen were unremitting in their attentions. Drs. Lindsley and\r\nThomas, of the city, were also immediately called in. Under the advice of\r\nthe medical gentlemen present, he was cupped, and mustard plasters were\r\napplied, which seemed to afford some relief. Reviving a little and\r\nrecovering consciousness, Mr. Adams inquired for his wife. She was\r\npresent, but in extreme illness, and suffering the most poignant sorrow.\r\nAfter a few moments' interval he relapsed again into unconsciousness. A\r\ncorrespondent of the New York Express describes as follows the progress of\r\nthese melancholy events:--\r\n\r\n\"Half past one o'clock.--Mr. Benton communicated to the Senate the notice\r\nof the sudden illness of Mr. Adams, and moved an adjournment of that body.\r\n\r\n\"Quarter to two.--Mr. Adams has several physicians with him, but exhibits\r\nno signs of returning consciousness. The report is that he is sinking.\r\n\r\n\"Two o'clock.--Mr. Giddings informs me that he shows signs of life. He\r\nhas just now attempted to speak, but cannot articulate a word. Under\r\nmedical advice he has submitted to leeching.\r\n\r\n\"Half past two.--Mrs. Adams and his niece and nephew are with him, and Mr.\r\nA. is no worse. The reports, however, are quite contradictory, and many,\r\ndespair of his recovery.\r\n\r\n\"Three o'clock.--None but the physicians and the family are present, and\r\nthe reports again become more and more doubtful. The physicians say that\r\nMr. Adams may not live more than an hour, or he may live two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"His right side is wholly paralyzed, and the left not under control, there\r\nbeing continually involuntary motions of the muscles. Everything which\r\nmedical aid can do, has been done for his relief. Briefly, just now, by\r\nclose attention, he seemed anxious to 'thank the officers of the House.'\r\nThen, again, he was heard to say--'This is the last of earth! I AM\r\nCONTENT!' These were the last words which fell from the lips of, 'the old\r\nman eloquent,' as his spirit plumed its pinions to soar to other worlds.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams lay in the Speaker's room, in a state of apparent\r\nunconsciousness, through the 22d and 23d,--Congress, in the meantime,\r\nassembling in respectful silence, and immediately adjourning from day to\r\nday. The struggles of contending parties ceased--the strife for interest,\r\nplace, power, was hushed to repose. Silence reigned through the halls of\r\nthe capitol, save the cautious tread and whispered inquiry of anxious\r\nquestioners. The soul of a sage, a patriot, a Christian, is preparing to\r\ndepart from the world!--no sound is heard to ruffle its sweet serenity!--a\r\ncalmness and peace, fitting the momentous occasion, prevail around!\r\n\r\nThe elements of life and death continued their uncertain balance, until\r\nseven o'clock, on the evening of the 23d, when the spirit of JOHN QUINCY\r\nADAMS bade adieu to earth forever, and winged its flight to God.\r\n\r\n  \"Give forth thy chime, thou solemn bell,\r\n  Thou grave, unfold thy marble cell;\r\n   O earth! receive upon thy breast,\r\n   The weary traveller to his rest.\r\n\r\n  \"O God! extend thy arms of love,\r\n   A spirit seeketh thee above!\r\n   Ye heav'nly palaces unclose,\r\n   Receive the weary to repose.\"\r\n\r\nThe tidings of Mr. Adams' death flew on electrical wings to every portion\r\nof the Union. A statesman, a philanthropist, a father of the Republic, had\r\nfallen. A nation heard, and were dissolved in tears!\r\n\r\nIn the history of American statesmen, none lived a life so long in the\r\npublic service--none had trusts so numerous confided to their care--none\r\ndied a death so glorious. Beneath the dome of the nation's capitol; in the\r\nmidst of the field of his highest usefulness, where he had won fadeless\r\nlaurels of renown; equipped with the armor in which he had fought so many\r\nbattles for truth and freedom, he fell beneath the shaft of the king of\r\nterrors. And how bright, how enviable the reputation he left behind! As a\r\nman, pure, upright, benevolent, religious--his hand unstained by a drop of\r\nhuman blood; uncharged, unsuspected of crime, of premeditated wrong, of an\r\nimmoral act, of an unchaste word--as a statesman, lofty and patriotic in\r\nall his purposes; devoted to the interests of the people; sacredly\r\nexercising all power entrusted to his keeping for the good of the public\r\nalone, unmindful of personal interest and aggrandizement; an enthusiastic\r\nlover of liberty; a faithful, fearless defender of the rights of man! The\r\nsun of his life in its lengthened course through the political heavens,\r\nwas unobscured by a spot, undimmed by a cloud; and when, at the close of\r\nthe long day, it sank beneath the horizon, the whole firmament glowed with\r\nthe brilliancy of its reflected glories! Rulers, statesmen, legislators!\r\nstudy and emulate such a life--seek after a character so beloved, a death\r\nso honorable, a fame so immortal. Like him--\r\n\r\n  \"So live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\n   The innumerable caravan, that moves\r\n   To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\r\n   His chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\n   Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\r\n   Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained, and soothed\r\n   By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\r\n   Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\n   About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day succeeding Mr. Adams' death, when the two Houses of Congress\r\nmet, the full attendance of members, and a crowded auditory, attested the\r\ndeep desire felt by all to witness the proceedings which would take place\r\nin relation to the death of one who had long occupied so high a place in\r\nthe councils of the Republic. As soon as the House of Representatives was\r\ncalled to order, the Speaker, (the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop of\r\nMassachusetts,) rose, and in a feeling manner addressed the House as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives of the United States: It has\r\nbeen thought fit that the Chair should announce officially to the House,\r\nan event already known to the members individually, and which has filled\r\nall our hearts with sadness. A seat on this floor has been vacated, toward\r\nwhich all eyes have been accustomed to turn with no common interest. A\r\nvoice has been hushed forever in this Hall, to which all ears have been\r\nwont to listen with profound reverence. A venerable form has faded from\r\nour sight, around which we have daily clustered with an affectionate\r\nregard. A name has been stricken from the roll of the living statesmen of\r\nour land, which has been associated, for more than half a century, with\r\nthe highest civil service, and the loftiest civil renown.\r\n\r\n\"On Monday, the 21st instant, JOHN QUINCY ADAMS sunk in his seat, in\r\npresence of us all, by a sudden illness, from which he never recovered;\r\nand he died, in the Speaker's room, at a quarter past seven o'clock last\r\nevening, with the officers of the House and the delegation of his own\r\nMassachusetts around him.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever advanced age, long experience, great ability, vast learning,\r\naccumulated public honors, a spotless private character, and a firm\r\nreligious faith, could do, to render anyone an object of interest,\r\nrespect, and admiration, they had done for this distinguished person; and\r\ninterest, respect, and admiration, are but feeble terms to express the\r\nfeelings with which the members of this House and the people of the\r\ncountry have long regarded him.\r\n\r\n\"After a life of eighty years, devoted from its earliest maturity to the\r\npublic service, he has at length gone to his rest. He has been privileged\r\nto die at his post; to fall while in the discharge of his duties; to\r\nexpire beneath the roof of the capitol; and to have his last scene\r\nassociated forever, in history, with the birthday of that illustrious\r\npatriot, whose just discernment brought him first into the service of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"The close of such a life, under such circumstances, is not an event for\r\nunmingled emotions. We cannot find it in our hearts to regret, that he has\r\ndied as he has died. He himself could have desired no other end. 'This is\r\nthe end of earth,' were his last words, uttered on the day on which he\r\nfell. But we might also hear him exclaiming, as he left us--in a language\r\nhardly less familiar to him than his native tongue--'Hoc est, nimirum,\r\nmagis feliciter de vita migrare, quam mori.'\r\n\r\n\"It is for others to suggest what honors shall be paid to his memory. No\r\nacts of ours are necessary to his fame. But it may be due to ourselves and\r\nto the country, that the national sense of his character and services\r\nshould be fitly commemorated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes of South Carolina arose and addressed the House in most\r\neloquent strains. The following are extracts from his eulogy:--\r\n\r\n\"The mingled tones of sorrow, like the voice of many waters, have come\r\nunto us from a sister State--Massachusetts weeping for her honored son.\r\nThe State I have the honor in part to represent once endured, with yours,\r\na common suffering, battled for a common cause, and rejoiced in a common\r\ntriumph. Surely, then, it is meet that in this, the day of your\r\naffliction, we should mingle our griefs.\r\n\r\n\"When a great man falls, the nation mourns; when a patriarch is removed,\r\nthe people weep. Ours, my associates, is no common bereavement. The chain\r\nwhich linked our hearts with the gifted spirits of former times, has been\r\nrudely snapped. The lips from which flowed those living and glorious\r\ntruths that our fathers uttered, are closed in death! Yes, my friends,\r\nDeath has been among us! He has not entered the humble cottage of some\r\nunknown, ignoble peasant; he has knocked audibly at the palace of a\r\nnation! His footstep has been heard in the Hall of State! He has cloven\r\ndown his victim in the midst of the councils of a people! He has borne in\r\ntriumph from among you the gravest, wisest, most reverend head! Ah! he has\r\ntaken him as a trophy who was once chief over many States, adorned with\r\nvirtue, and learning, and truth; he has borne at his chariot-wheels a\r\nrenowned one of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"There was no incident in the birth, the life, the death of Mr. Adams, not\r\nintimately woven with the history of the land. Born in the night of his\r\ncountry's tribulation, he heard the first murmurs of discontent; he saw\r\nthe first efforts for deliverance. Whilst yet a little child, he listened\r\nwith eagerness to the whispers of freedom as they breathed from the lips\r\nof her almost inspired apostles: he caught the fire that was then kindled;\r\nhis eye beamed with the first ray; he watched the day spring from on high,\r\nand long before he departed from earth, it was graciously vouchsafed unto\r\nhim to behold the effulgence of her noontide glory. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"He disrobed himself with dignity of the vestures of office, not to retire\r\nto the shades of Quincy, but, in the maturity of his intellect, in the\r\nvigor of his thought, to leap into this arena, and to continue, as he had\r\nbegun, a disciple, an ardent devotee at the temple of his country's\r\nfreedom. How, in this department, he ministered to his country's wants, we\r\nall know, and have witnessed. How often we have crowded into that aisle,\r\nand clustered around that now vacant desk, to listen to the counsels of\r\nwisdom, as they fell from the lips of the venerable sage, we can all\r\nremember, for it was but of yesterday. But what a change! How wondrous!\r\nhow sudden! 'Tis like a vision of the night. That form which we beheld but\r\na few days since, is now cold in death!\r\n\r\n\"But the last Sabbath, and in this hall, he worshipped with others. Now\r\nhis spirit mingles with the noble army of martyrs, and the just made\r\nperfect, in the eternal adoration of the living God. With him \"this is the\r\nend of earth.\" He sleeps the sleep that knows no waking. He is gone--and\r\nforever! The sun that ushers in the morn of that next holy day, while it\r\ngilds the lofty dome of the capitol, shall rest with soft and mellow light\r\nupon the consecrated spot beneath whose turf forever lies the PATRIOT\r\nFATHER and the PATRIOT SAGE!\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were unanimously passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this House has heard with the deepest sensibility, of the\r\ndeath in this capitol of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, a Member of the House from the\r\nState of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, as a testimony of respect for the memory of this\r\ndistinguished statesman, the officers and members of the House will wear\r\nthe usual badge of mourning, and attend the funeral in this hall on\r\nSaturday next, at 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a committee of thirty be appointed to superintend the\r\nfuneral solemnities.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the proceedings of this House in relation to the death of\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS be communicated to the family of the deceased by the\r\nClerk.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the seat in this hall just vacated by the death of the\r\nlate JOHN QUINCY ADAMS be unoccupied for thirty days, and that it,\r\ntogether with the hall, remain clothed with the symbol of mourning during\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Speaker appoint one member of this House from each\r\nState and Territory, as a committee to escort the remains of our venerable\r\nfriend, the Honorable JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, to the place designated by his\r\nfriends for his interment.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this House, as a further mark of respect for the memory of\r\nthe deceased, do adjourn to Saturday next, the day appointed for the\r\nfuneral.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, after a formal annunciation of the death of Mr. Adams, in a\r\nmessage from the House of Representatives, Mr. Davis, of Massachusetts,\r\narose and delivered a feeling address, on the life and services of the\r\ndeceased patriot. The following are extracts:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: By the recent affliction of my colleague, (Mr. Webster,) a\r\npainful duty devolves upon me. The message just delivered from the House\r\nproves that the hand of God has been again among us. A great and good man\r\nhas gone from our midst. If, in speaking of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, I can give\r\nutterance to the language of my own heart, I am confident I shall meet\r\nwith a response from the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"He was born in the then Province of Massachusetts, while she was girding\r\nherself for the great revolutionary struggle which was then before her.\r\nHis parentage is too well known to need even an allusion; yet I may be\r\npardoned if I say, that his father seemed born to aid in the establishment\r\nof our free Government, and his mother was a suitable companion and\r\nco-laborer of such a patriot. The cradle hymns of the child were the songs\r\nof liberty. The power and competence of man for self-government were the\r\ntopics which he most frequently heard discussed by the wise men of the\r\nday, and the inspiration thus caught gave form and pressure to his after\r\nlife. Thus early imbued with the love of free institutions, educated by\r\nhis father for the service of his country, and early led by WASHINGTON to\r\nits altar, he has stood before the world as one of its eminent statesmen.\r\nHe has occupied, in turn, almost every place of honor which the country\r\ncould give him, and for more than half a century, has been thus identified\r\nwith its history. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"It is believed to have been the earnest wish of his heart to die, like\r\nChatham, in the midst of his labors. It was a sublime thought, that where\r\nhe had toiled in the house of the nation, in hours of the day devoted to\r\nits service, the stroke of death should reach him, and there sever the\r\nties of love and patriotism which bound him to earth. He fell in his seat,\r\nattacked by paralysis, of which he had before been a subject. To describe\r\nthe scene which ensued would be impossible. It was more than the\r\nspontaneous gush of feeling which all such events call forth, so much to\r\nthe honor of our nature. It was the expression of reverence for his moral\r\nworth, of admiration for his great intellectual endowments, and of\r\nveneration for his age and public services. All gathered round the\r\nsufferer, and the strong sympathy and deep feeling which were manifested,\r\nshowed that the business of the House (which was instantly adjourned) was\r\nforgotten amid the distressing anxieties of the moment. He was soon\r\nremoved to the apartment of the Speaker, where he remained surrounded by\r\nafflicted friends till the weary clay resigned its immortal spirit. 'This\r\nis the end of earth!' Brief but emphatic words. They were among the last\r\nuttered by the dying Christian.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Davis had concluded his remarks, Mr. Benton, of Missouri,\r\ndelivered a most beautiful eulogy on the character of Mr. Adams. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: The voice of his native State has been heard through one\r\nof the Senators of Massachusetts, announcing the death of her aged and\r\nmost distinguished son. The voice of the other Senator, (Mr. Webster,) is\r\nnot heard, nor is his presence seen. A domestic calamity, known to us all,\r\nand felt by us all, confines him to the chamber of private grief, while\r\nthe Senate is occupied with the public manifestations of a respect and\r\nsorrow which a national loss inspires. In the absence of that Senator, and\r\nas the member of this body longest here, it is not unfitting or unbecoming\r\nin me to second the motion which has been made for extending the last\r\nhonors of the Senate to him who, forty-five years ago, was a member of\r\nthis body, who, at the time of his death, was among the oldest members of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and who, putting the years of his service\r\ntogether, was the oldest of all the members of the American Government.\r\n\r\n\"The eulogium of Mr. Adams is made in the facts of his life, which the\r\nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Davis) has so strikingly stated, that,\r\nfrom early manhood to octogenarian age, he has been constantly and most\r\nhonorably employed in the public service. For a period of more than fifty\r\nyears, from the time of his first appointment as Minister abroad under\r\nWashington, to his last election to the House of Representatives by the\r\npeople of his native district, he has been constantly retained in the\r\npublic service, and that, not by the favor of a Sovereign, or by\r\nhereditary title, but by the elections and appointments of republican\r\nGovernment. This fact makes the eulogy of the illustrious deceased. For\r\nwhat, except a union of all the qualities which command the esteem and\r\nconfidence of man, could have ensured a public service so long, by\r\nappointments free and popular, and from sources so various and exalted?\r\nMinister many times abroad; member of this body; member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives; cabinet Minister; President of the United States; such\r\nhas been the galaxy of his splendid appointments. And what but moral\r\nexcellence the most perfect--intellectual ability the most eminent--\r\nfidelity the most unwavering--service the most useful, could have\r\ncommanded such a succession of appointments so exalted, and from sources\r\nso various and so eminent? Nothing less could have commanded such a series\r\nof appointments; and accordingly we see the union of all these great\r\nqualities in him who has received them.\r\n\r\n\"In this long career of public service Mr. Adams was distinguished not\r\nonly by faithful attention to all the great duties of his stations, but to\r\nall their less and minor duties.  He was not the Salaminian galley, to be\r\nlaunched only on extraordinary occasions, but he was the ready vessel,\r\nalways launched when the duties of his station required it, be the\r\noccasion great or small. As President, as cabinet Minister, as Minister\r\nabroad, he examined all questions that came before him, and examined all\r\nin all their parts, in all the minutiae of their detail, as well as in all\r\nthe vastness of their comprehension. As Senator, and as a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, the obscure committee-room was as much the\r\nwitness of his laborious application to the drudgery of legislation, as\r\nthe halls of the two Houses were to the ever ready speech, replete with\r\nknowledge, which instructed all hearers, enlightened all subjects, and\r\ngave dignity and ornament to debate.\r\n\r\n\"In the observance of all the proprieties of life, Mr. Adams was a most\r\nnoble and impressive example. He cultivated the minor as well as the\r\ngreater virtues. Wherever his presence could give aid and countenance to\r\nwhat was useful and honorable to man, there he was. In the exercises of\r\nthe school and of the college--in the meritorious meetings of the\r\nagricultural, mechanical, and commercial societies--in attendance upon\r\nDivine worship--he gave the punctual attendance rarely seen but in those\r\nwho are free from the weight of public cares.\r\n\r\n\"Punctual to every duty, death found him at the post of duty; and where\r\nelse could it have found him, at any stage of his career, for the fifty\r\nyears of his illustrious public life?  From the time of his first\r\nappointment by Washington to his last election by the people of his native\r\ntown, where could death have found him but at the post of duty? At that\r\npost, in the fullness of age in the ripeness of renown, crowned with\r\nhonors, surrounded by his family, his friends, and admirers, and in the\r\nvery presence of the national representation, he has been gathered to his\r\nfathers, leaving behind him the memory of public services which are the\r\nhistory of his country for half a century, and the example of a life,\r\npublic and private, which should be the study and the model of the\r\ngenerations of his countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Benton's address, the following resolutions,\r\nintroduced by Mr. Davis, were passed by the Senate:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Senate has received with deep sensibility the message\r\nfrom the House of Representatives announcing the death of the Hon. JOHN\r\nQUINCY ADAMS, a Representative from the State of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, in token of respect for the memory of the deceased, the\r\nSenate will attend his funeral at the hour appointed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and will wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, as a further mark of respect for the memory of the\r\ndeceased, the Senate do now adjourn until Saturday next, the time\r\nappointed for the funeral.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Polk issued a Proclamation announcing to the nation its\r\nbereavement, and directing the suspension of all public business for the\r\nday. The public offices were clothed in mourning. Orders were issued from\r\nthe War and Navy Departments, directing that at every military and naval\r\nstation, on the day after the order should be received, the honors\r\ncustomary to the illustrious dead should be paid.\r\n\r\nAt 12 o'clock on Saturday, the 26th of February, the funeral took place in\r\nthe capitol. It was a solemn, an imposing scene. The Hall of\r\nRepresentatives was hung in sable habiliments. The portraits of Washington\r\nand La Fayette, the beautiful statue of the Muse of History in the car of\r\nTime, and the vacant chair of the deceased, were wreathed in crape. In the\r\nmidst, and the most conspicuous of all, was the coffin containing the\r\nremains of the illustrious dead, covered with its velvet pall. The\r\nPresident of the United States, and the Heads of Departments, the Members\r\nof both Houses of Congress, the Judges of the Supreme Court, the Foreign\r\nMinisters, Officers of the Army and Navy, Members of State Legislatures,\r\nand an immense concourse of the great, the wise, and the good, were\r\npresent, to bestow honor on all that remained of the statesman, the\r\nphilosopher, and the Christian.\r\n\r\nA discourse was delivered on the occasion, by the Rev. R. R. Gurley,\r\nchaplain to the House of Representatives, from Job xi. 17, 18--\"And thine\r\nage shall be clearer than the noon-day; thou shalt shine forth, thou\r\nshalt be as the morning: and thou shalt be secure, because there is\r\nhope.\" The following are extracts from the sermon:--\r\n\r\n\"In some circumstances, on some occasions, we most naturally express our\r\nemotions in silence and in tears. What voice of man can add to the\r\nimpressiveness and solemnity of this scene? The presence and aspect of\r\nthis vast assembly, the Chief Magistrate, Counsellors, Judges, Senators,\r\nand Representatives of the nation, distinguished officers of the army and\r\nthe navy, and the honored Ambassadors from foreign powers,--these symbols\r\nand badges of a universal mourning, darkening this hall into sympathy with\r\nour sorrow, leave no place for the question, 'Know ye not that a prince\r\nand a great man is fallen in Israel?' Near to us, indeed, has come the\r\ninvisible hand of the Almighty--that hand in which is the soul of every\r\nliving thing, and the breath of all mankind; in this very hall, from\r\nyonder seat, which he so long occupied, in the midst of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, has it taken one full of years and honors,\r\neminent, for more than half a century, in various departments of the\r\npublic service; who adorned every station, even the highest, by his\r\nabilities and virtues; and whose influence, powerful in its beneficence,\r\nis felt in many, if not in all the States of the civilized world.\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Not more certainly is the body invigorated and preserved by suitable\r\nfood, by manly exercises, by the vital air, than are the intellectual and\r\nmoral faculties by the investigation and reception of divine truths, by\r\nhabits of obedience to the divine will, by cheerful submission to the\r\norder and discipline of Divine Providence. Nor let us ever distrust the\r\nFather of our spirits, who knows perfectly all the wants of our nature,\r\nbut rest assured that his commandments in the sacred Scriptures are\r\nentirely in harmony with the decrees of his providence; and that as to\r\nfear Him and keep His commandments is the whole duty (because the highest\r\nduty, and comprehending all others), so will it prove the whole and\r\neternal happiness of man. If the indissoluble and harmonious connection\r\nbetween the laws of nature, of Providence and the moral law, be not\r\nalways obvious, it is always certain. Over all the darkness, disturbances,\r\nand evils of the world shines revealed, more or less clearly, like the\r\nserene and cheerful heavens, this immutable law, binding virtue, however\r\nobscure, persecuted, or forsaken, to reward; duty, however humble or\r\narduous, to happiness. Hence the declaration, that all things shall work\r\ntogether for good to them who love God, and that all things are\r\ntheirs--the past and future, things temporal and spiritual, prosperity and\r\nadversity, angels, and principalities, and powers, and God himself, in all\r\nthe resources of his wisdom and all the eternity of his reign.\r\n\r\n\"How shone out, clear as the noonday, yet mild and gentle as the morning,\r\neven in age, in the life and character of that great and venerable man,\r\naround whose precious, but, alas! inanimate form we all press in\r\ngratitude, admiration, and love, those high virtues derived from faith in\r\nGod, and nurtured by his revealed truth, this bereaved Congress, and, I\r\nmay add, this nation witnesses. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Truly emblematic of his moral integrity and strength of character would\r\nbe the granite column from his native hills, one and entire, just in its\r\nproportions, towering in its height, immoveable in its foundations, and\r\npointing to Heaven as the temple and throne of everlasting authority, the\r\nfinal refuge, the imperishable home of all regenerated and faithful souls.\r\n\r\n\"Independence of mere human authority in the use of his reason, on all\r\nsubjects, was united with veneration most sincere and profound for the\r\nsacred Scriptures, as a supernatural revelation from God, 'whose\r\nprerogative extends not less to the reason than the will of man,' and from\r\na daily perusal of the Divine Word, and a constant and devout attendance\r\nupon the public worship of the Sabbath, although differing on some points\r\nfrom common opinions, he cherished enlarged views of Christian communion,\r\nand recognized in most, if not all the religious denominations of this\r\ncountry, members of one and the same family and kingdom of Jesus Christ.\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Alas, the sad and appalling ruins of death! 'This is the end of earth.'\r\nApproach! lovers of pleasure, seekers after wisdom, aspirants, by\r\npre-eminence in station, and power, and influence among men, to fame; see\r\nthe end of human distinctions and earthly greatness! Surely man walketh\r\nin a vain show; surely man in his best estate is altogether vanity. How\r\npertinent to this scene the words of Job: 'He leadeth princes away\r\nspoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. He removeth away the speech of the\r\ntrusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. He discovereth\r\ndeep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of\r\ndeath!' How, indeed, is the mighty fallen, and the head of the wise laid\r\nlow! All flesh is grass--all the glory of man as the flower of the field.\r\nAnd shall this vast congregation soon be brought to the grave--that house\r\nappointed for all the living? Hear, then, the great announcement of the\r\nSon of God: 'I am the resurrection and the life, and whosoever believeth\r\nin me, though he were dead yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth and\r\nbelieveth in me shall never die.' Is it strange that he who communed so\r\nmuch with the future as the great statesman to whose virtues and memory we\r\nnow pay this sad, final, solemn tribute of honor and affection, should, in\r\nthe last conversation I ever had with him, have expressed both regret and\r\nastonishment at the indifference among too many of our public men to the\r\ntruths and ordinances of our holy religion? Is it to affect our hearts\r\nthat he has been permitted to fall in the midst of us, to arouse us from\r\nthis insensibility, and cause us to press towards the gates of the eternal\r\ncity of God? Let us bless God for another great example to shine upon us,\r\nthat another star (we humbly trust) is planted amid the heavenly\r\nconstellations to guide us to eternity!\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the exercises in the capitol, a vast procession,\r\nescorted by military companies, conveyed the remains to the Congressional\r\nburying ground, where they were to rest until preparations for their\r\nremoval to Quincy should be completed.\r\n\r\n  \"Sad was the pomp that yesterday beheld,\r\n   As with the mourner's heart the anthem swelled;\r\n   The rich-plumed canopy, the gorgeous pall,\r\n   The sacred march, and sable vested wall!--\r\n   These were not rites of inexpressive show,\r\n   But hallowed as the types of real woe!\r\n   Illustrious deceased! a NATION'S sighs,\r\n   A NATION'S HEART, went with thine obsequies!\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter of thanks from Mrs. Adams, addressed to the Speaker,\r\nwas laid before the House of Representatives:--\r\n\r\n                                         \"Washington, February 29, 1848.\r\n\"SIR: The resolutions in honor of my dear deceased husband, passed by the\r\nillustrious assembly over which you preside, and of which he at the moment\r\nof his death was a member, have been duly communicated to me.\r\n\r\n\"Penetrated with grief at this distressing event of my life, mourning the\r\nloss of one who has been at once my example and my support through the\r\ntrials of half a century, permit me nevertheless to express through you my\r\ndeepest gratitude for the signal manner in which the public regard has\r\nbeen voluntarily manifested by your honorable body, and the consolation\r\nderived to me and mine from the reflection that the unwearied efforts of\r\nan old public servant have not even in this world proved without their\r\nreward in the generous appreciation of them by his country.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, I remain, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                             \"LOUISA CATHARINE ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following week, the Committee of one from each State and Territory\r\nin the Union, appointed by the House of Representatives to take charge of\r\nthe remains of the deceased ex-President, and convey them to Quincy for\r\nfinal interment, commenced their journey. It was a new, yet inexpressibly\r\nthrilling and imposing spectacle. The dead body of \"the Old Man Eloquent,\"\r\nsurrounded and guarded by a son of each of the States and Territories of\r\nthat Union which he had so largely assisted in consolidating and\r\nsustaining, leaves the capitol of the nation, where for more than thirty\r\nyears he had acted the most conspicuous part among the fathers of the\r\nland, to rest in the tomb of its ancestors, amid the venerable shades of\r\nQuincy. How solemn the progress of such a procession. It was indeed, \"the\r\nFuneral March of the Dead!\" Wherever it passed, the people rose up and\r\npaid the utmost marks of respect to the remains of one who had occupied so\r\nlarge a space in the history of his country. In towns, in villages, in\r\ncities, as the mournful cortege swept through, business was suspended,\r\nflags were displayed at half mast, bells were tolled, minute guns were\r\nfired, civil and military processions received the sacred remains, and\r\nwatched over them by night and by day, and passed them on from State to\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\"What a progress was it which the dead patriot thus made! From the capitol\r\nof the nation, beneath whose dome, and while at his post of duty, he was\r\nseized by death--within sight almost of that Mount Vernon where repose\r\nthe ashes of him, the Father of his Country, who first distinguished,\r\nencouraged and employed the extraordinary capacity of the youthful\r\nAdams--through cities that in his life time have grown up from\r\nvillages--passing, at Baltimore, almost beneath the shadow of the monument\r\nwhich there testifies of the valor of those who fell for country in the\r\nwar of 1812--and in Philadelphia halting and reposing within the hall\r\nwhere his great father; John Adams, had fearlessly stood for Independence,\r\nand where Independence was proclaimed--the dead passed on, everywhere\r\nfollowed by the reverential gaze and the mourning heart, till, reaching\r\nthe great metropolis of New York, where the same father had been sworn in\r\nand taken his seat, as the first Vice President of the United States, with\r\nGeorge Washington for President! Thence away the march was resumed, till\r\nit reached old Faneuil Hall--the cradle of American liberty, the fitting\r\nfinal restingplace, while yet unburied, of the body of one in whose heart,\r\nat no moment of life, did the love of liberty, imbibed or strengthened in\r\nthat hall, suffer the slightest abatement.\" [Footnote: King's Eulogy.]\r\n\r\nFaneuil Hall was clothed in the dark drapery of mourning, fitting to\r\nreceive the body of one of the greatest of the many noble sons of the\r\nvenerable Bay State. Amid solemn dirges and appropriate ceremonies, the\r\nchairman of the Congressional Committee surrendered to a Committee from\r\nthe Legislature of Massachusetts, the sacred remains they had accompanied\r\nfrom the capitol of the United States.--\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the journey,\" said the chairman, \"there have been displayed\r\nmanifestations of the highest admiration and respect for the memory of\r\nyour late distinguished fellow-citizen. In the large cities through which\r\nwe expected to pass, we anticipated such demonstrations; but in every\r\nvillage and hamlet, at the humblest cottage which we passed, and from the\r\nlaborers in the field, the same profound respect was testified by their\r\nuncovered heads.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature having thus received the\r\nbody from its Congressional escort, in turn surrendered it to the keeping\r\nof the municipal authorities of Boston, for burial at Quincy. This\r\nceremony was performed by Mr. Buckingham, chairman of the Legislative\r\nCommittee, in these impressive words:--\r\n\r\n\"In the name and behalf of the Government and People of the Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts, whose honored but humble servant I this day am, I\r\nconsign to your faithful keeping, Mr. Mayor, the remains of JOHN QUINCY\r\nADAMS--all that was mortal of that venerable man, whose age and whose\r\nvirtues had rendered him an object of intense interest and admiration to\r\nhis country and to the world. We place these sacred remains in your\r\npossession, to be conveyed to their appointed home--to sleep in the\r\nsepulchre and with the dust of his fathers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Quincy, the Mayor, in accepting the guardianship conferred upon him in\r\nbehalf of the city of Boston, replied in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"There is something sublime in the scene that surrounds us. An honored son\r\nof Massachusetts--one who was educated by a signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--one who heard the thunder of the great struggle for liberty\r\non yonder hill, has, after a life of unparalleled usefulness and fidelity,\r\nfallen in the capitol of the country he served. His remains were escorted\r\nhere by delegates from every State in the Union. They have passed over\r\nspots ever memorable in history. They have everywhere been received with\r\nfuneral honors. They have reposed in the hall of independence. They now\r\nlie in the cradle of liberty. As a citizen of Massachusetts, I cannot but\r\nacknowledge our sense of the honor paid to her distinguished son. Mourned\r\nby a nation at its capitol, attended by the representatives of millions to\r\nthe grave, he has received a tribute to his memory unequalled among men.\r\n\r\n\"These remains now rest in the cradle of liberty. It is their last\r\nresting-place on their journey home. As a statesman's, 'this is to them\r\nthe last of earth!' To-morrow they will be deposited in the peaceful\r\nchurch-yard of the village of his birth, there to be mourned, not as\r\nstatesmen mourn for statesmen, but as friends mourn for friends.\r\n\r\n\"He will be 'gathered to his fathers!' And how great, in this case, is the\r\nsignificance of the expression! It is possible that other men may be\r\nattended as he will be to the grave. But when again shall the tomb of a\r\nPresident of the United States open its doors to receive a son who has\r\nfilled the same office?\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the body, under the charge of the municipal officers\r\nof Boston, was conveyed to Quincy. In the Unitarian church, in the\r\npresence of old neighbors and friends, the last funeral exercises were\r\nheld, and the last sad burial service was performed.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the graves of his fathers, overshadowed by aged trees,\r\nwhich had sheltered his head in the days of boyhood, in a plain tomb,\r\nprepared under his own direction, and inscribed simply with his name,\r\nsleep the ashes of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\n  \"Let no weak drops\r\n   Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom\r\n   Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child,\r\n   These are the tombs that claim the tender tear\r\n   And elegiac songs. But Adams calls\r\n   For other notes of gratulation high;\r\n   That now he wanders thro' those endless worlds\r\n   He here so well descried; and, wondering, talks\r\n   And hymns their Author with his glad compeers.\r\n   Columbia's boast! whether with angels thou\r\n   Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow blest\r\n   Who joy to see the honor of their kind;\r\n   Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing,\r\n   Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs,\r\n   Comparing things with things, in rapture lost,\r\n   And grateful adoration for that light\r\n   So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below\r\n   From Light himself--oh! look with pity down\r\n   On human kind, a frail, erroneous race!\r\n   Exalt the spirit of a downward world!\r\n   O'er thy dejected country chief preside,\r\n   And be her Genius called! her studies raise,\r\n   Correct her manners, and inspire her youth;\r\n   For, though deprav'd and sunk, she brought thee forth,\r\n   And glories in thy name. She points thee out\r\n   To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star--\r\n   Thy star, which, followed steadfastly, shall lead\r\n   To wisdom, virtue, glory here, and joy\r\n   Unspeakable in worlds to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEULOGY.[Footnote: Delivered before the Legislature of New York, by Wm. H.\r\nSeward.]\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of extraordinary events. British-American Civilization\r\nand Spanish-American Society have come into collision, each in its fullest\r\nmaturity. The armies of the North have penetrated the chapparels at Palo\r\nAlto and Resaca de la Palma--passed the fortresses of Monterey, and rolled\r\nback upon the heart of Mexico the unavailing tide of strong resistance\r\nfrom the mountain-side of Buena Vista. Martial colonists are encamped on\r\nthe coasts of California, while San Juan d'Ulloa has fallen, and the\r\ninvaders have swept the gorge of Cerro Gordo--carried Perote and Puebla,\r\nand planted the banner of burning stars and ever-multiplying stripes on\r\nthe towers of the city of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth Congress assembles in this conjuncture, and the debates are\r\nsolemn, earnest, and bewildering. Interest, passion, conscience, freedom,\r\nand humanity, all have their advocates. Shall new loans and levies be\r\ngranted to prosecute still farther a war so glorious? or shall it be\r\nabandoned? Shall we be content with the humiliation of the foe? or shall\r\nwe complete his subjugation? Would that severity be magnanimous, or even\r\njust? Nay, is the war itself just? Who provoked, and by what unpardonable\r\noffence, this disastrous strife between two eminent Republics, so\r\nscandalous to Democratic Institutions? Where shall we trace anew the\r\never-advancing line of our empire? Shall it be drawn on the shore of the\r\nRio Grande, or on the summit of the Sierra Madre? or shall Mexican\r\nIndependence be extinguished, and our eagle close his adventurous pinions\r\nonly when he looks off upon the waves that separate us from the Indies?\r\nDoes Freedom own and accept our profuse oblations of blood, or does she\r\nreject the sacrifice? Will these conquests extend her domain, or will they\r\nbe usurped by ever-grasping slavery? What, effect will this new-born\r\nambition have upon ourselves? Will it leave us the virtue to continue the\r\ncareer of social progress? How shall we govern the conquered people? Shall\r\nwe incorporate their mingled races with ourselves, or rule them with the\r\ndespotism of proconsular power? Can we preserve these remote and hostile\r\npossessions in any way, without forfeiting our own blood-bought heritage\r\nof freedom?\r\n\r\nSteam and lightning, which have become docile messengers, make the\r\nAmerican people listeners to this high debate, and anxiety, and interest,\r\nintense and universal, absorb them all. Suddenly the council is dissolved.\r\nSilence is in the capitol, and sorrow has thrown its pall over the land.\r\nWhat new event is this? Has some Cromwell closed the legislative\r\nchambers? or has some Caesar, returning from his distant conquests, passed\r\nthe Rubicon, seized the purple, and fallen in the Senate beneath the\r\nswords of self-appointed executioners of his country's vengeance? No!\r\nnothing of all this. What means, then, this abrupt and fearful silence?\r\nWhat unlooked for calamity has quelled the debates of the Senate and\r\ncalmed the excitement of the people? An old man, whose tongue once indeed\r\nwas eloquent, but now through age had well nigh lost its cunning, has\r\nfallen into the swoon of death. He was not an actor in the drama of\r\nconquest--nor had his feeble voice yet mingled in the lofty argument--\r\n\r\n  \"A grey-haired sire, whose eye intent\r\n   Was on the visioned future bent.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now he has dreamed out at last the troubled dream of life. Sighs of\r\nunavailing grief ascend to Heaven. Panegyric, fluent in long-stifled\r\npraise, performs its office. The army and the navy pay conventional\r\nhonors, with the pomp of national woe, and then the hearse moves onward.\r\nIt rests appropriately, on its way, in the hall where independence was\r\nproclaimed, and again under the dome where freedom was born. At length the\r\ntomb of JOHN ADAMS opens to receive a SON, who also, born a subject of a\r\nking had stood as a representative of his emancipated country, before\r\nprincipalities and powers, and had won by merit, and worn without\r\nreproach, the honors of the Republic.\r\n\r\nFrom that scene, so impressive in itself, and impressive because it never\r\nbefore happened, and can never happen again, we have come up to this place\r\nsurrounded with the decent drapery of public mourning, on a day set apart\r\nby authority, to recite the history of the citizen, who, in the ripeness\r\nof age, and fulness of honors, has thus descended to his rest. It is fit\r\nto do so, because it is by such exercises that nations regenerate their\r\nearly virtues and renew their constitutions. All nations must perpetually\r\nrenovate their virtues and their constitutions, or perish. Never was there\r\nmore need to renovate ours than now, when we seem to be passing from the\r\nsafe old policy of peace and moderation into a career of conquest and\r\nmartial renown. Never was the duty of preserving our free institutions in\r\nall their purity, more obvious than it is now, when they have become\r\nbeacons to mankind in what seems to be a general dissolution of their\r\nancient social systems.\r\n\r\nThe history of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS is one that opens no new truth in the\r\nphilosophy of virtue; for there is no undiscovered truth in that\r\nphilosophy. But it is a history that sheds marvellous confirmation on\r\nmaxims which all mankind know, and yet are prone to undervalue and forget.\r\nThe exalted character before us was formed by the combination of virtue,\r\ncourage, assiduity, and modesty, under favorable conditions, with native\r\ntalent and genius, and illustrates the truth, that in morals as in nature,\r\nsimplicity is the chief element of the sublime.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams was fortunate in his lineage; in the period, and in the\r\nplace of his nativity; in all the circumstances of education; in the age\r\nand country in which he lived; in the incidents, as well as the occasions\r\nof his public service; and in the period and manner of his death. He was a\r\ndescendant from one of the Puritan planters of Massachusetts, and a son of\r\nthe most intrepid actor in the Revolution of Independence. Quincy, the\r\nplace of his birth, is a plain, bounded on the west by towering granite\r\nhills, and swept without defence by every wind from the ocean. Its soil\r\nin ancient times was as sterile as its climate is always rigorous.\r\n\r\nBorn on the eleventh day of July, 1767, in the hour of the agitation of\r\nrebellion, and reared within sight and sound of gathering war, the\r\nearliest political ideas he received were such as John Adams then\r\nuttered--\"We must fight.\" \"Sink or swim--live or die--survive or perish\r\nwith my country, is my unalterable determination.\" A mother fervently\r\npious, and eminent in intellectual gifts, directed with more than maternal\r\nassiduity and solicitude the education of him who was to render her own\r\nname immortal. Never quite divorced from home, yet twice, and for long\r\nperiods in his youth, a visitor in Europe, he enjoyed always the parental\r\ndiscipline of one of the founders of the American State, and often the\r\ndaily conversation of Franklin and Jefferson; and combined travel in\r\nFrance, Spain, England, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia, and even\r\ndiplomatic experience, with the instructions of the schools of Paris, of\r\nthe University at Leyden, and of Harvard University at Cambridge; and all\r\nthese influences fell upon him at a period when his country, then opening\r\nthe way to human liberty through trials of fire, fixed the attention of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Republic of the United States of America, is the\r\nmost important secular event in the history of the human race. It did not\r\ndisentangle the confused theory of the origin of Government, but cut\r\nthrough the bonds of power existing by prescription, at a blow; and thus\r\ndirectly and immediately affected the opinions and the actions of men in\r\nevery part of the civilized world. It animated them everywhere to seek\r\nfreedom from despotic power and aristocratic restraint. Whenever and\r\nwherever they have since moved, either by peaceful agitation or by\r\nphysical force, to meliorate systems of government, whether in France at\r\nthe close of the last century, or afterward on the second subversion of\r\nthe elder branch of the Bourbons, or in the recent overthrow of the\r\nconstitutional king, or in Ireland, or in England, or in Italy, or in\r\nGreece, or in South America, whether they succeeded or failed, there, in\r\nthe tumult or in the strife, was the spirit of the American Revolution.\r\n\"It gave an example of a great people, not merely emancipating themselves,\r\nbut governing themselves, without either a monarch to control, or an\r\naristocracy to restrain them; and it demonstrated, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the world, contrary to the predictions and theories of\r\nspeculative philosophy, that a great nation, when duly prepared, is\r\ncapable of self-government by purely republican institutions.\"\r\n\r\nBut the establishment of the American Republic was too great an\r\nachievement to be made all at once. It was a drama of five grand acts,\r\neach of which filled a considerable period, and called upon the stage\r\nactors of peculiar powers and distinguished virtues. Those acts were,\r\ncolonization, preparation, revolution, organization, consolidation.\r\n\r\nTwo of these acts were closed before John Quincy Adams was born. The\r\nthird, the revolution, the shortest of them all, dazzles the contemplation\r\nby the rapidity and the martial character of its incidents. The fourth,\r\nthe organization of the Government, by the splendors of genius elicited,\r\nand the felicity of the new form of government presented, satisfies the\r\nsuperficial inquirer that, when the Constitution had been adopted, nothing\r\nremained to perfect the great achievement. But other nations have had\r\nsuccessful revolutions, and have set up free constitutions, and have yet\r\nsunk again under reinvigorated despotism. The CONSOLIDATION of the\r\nAmerican Republic--the crowning act--occupied forty years, reaching from\r\n1789 to 1829. During that period, John Quincy Adams participated\r\ncontinually in public affairs, and ultimately became the principal actor.\r\n\r\nThe new Government was purely an experiment. In opposition to the fixed\r\nhabits of mankind, it established suffrage practically universal, and\r\nrepresentation so perfect that not one Legislative House only, but both\r\nHouses; not legislative officers only, but all officers, executive,\r\nministerial, and even judicial, were directly or indirectly elected by the\r\npeople. The longest term of the senatorial trust was but six years, and\r\nthe shortest only two, and even the tenure of the executive power was only\r\nfour years. This Government, betraying so much popular jealousy, was\r\ninvested with only special and limited sovereignty. The conduct of merely\r\nmunicipal affairs was distributed within the States, among Governments\r\neven more popular than the federal structure, and without whose\r\never-renewed support that structure must fall.\r\n\r\nThe Government thus constituted, so new, so complex and artificial, was to\r\nbe consolidated, in the midst of difficulties at home, and of dangers\r\nabroad. The constitution had been adopted only upon convictions of\r\nabsolute necessity, and with evanescent dispositions of compromise. By\r\nnearly half of the people it was thought too feeble to sustain itself, and\r\nsecure the rights for which governments are instituted among men. By as\r\nmany it was thought liable to be converted into an over-shadowing\r\ndespotism, more formidable and more odious than the monarchy which had\r\nbeen subverted. These conflicting opinions revealed themselves in like\r\ndiscordance upon every important question of administration, and were made\r\nthe basis of parties, which soon became jealous and irreconcilable, and\r\nultimately inveterate, and even in some degree disloyal.\r\n\r\nThese domestic feuds were aggravated by pernicious influences from Europe.\r\nIn the progress of western civilization, the nations of the earth had\r\nbecome social. The new Republic could not, like the Celestial Empire, or\r\nthat of Japan, confine itself within its own boundaries, and exist without\r\nnational intercourse. It had entered the family of nations. But the\r\nposition it was to assume, and the advantages it was to be allowed to\r\nenjoy, were yet to be ascertained and fixed. Its independence, confessed\r\nto be only a doubtful experiment at home, was naturally thought ephemeral\r\nin Europe. Its example was ominous, and the European Powers willingly\r\nbelieved that, if discountenanced and baffled, America would soon relapse\r\ninto colonial subjugation. Such prejudices were founded in the fixed\r\nhabits of society. Not only the thirteen colonies, but the whole American\r\nhemisphere, had been governed by European States from the period of its\r\ndiscovery. The very soil belonged to the trans-atlantic monarchs by\r\ndiscovery, or by ecclesiastical gift. Dominion over it attached by divine\r\nright to their persons, and drew after it obligations of inalienable\r\nallegiance upon those who became the inhabitants of the new world. The new\r\nworld was indeed divided between different powers, but the system of\r\ngovernment was the same. It was administered for the benefit of the\r\nparental State alone. Each power prohibited all foreign trade with its\r\nColonies, and all intercourse between them and other plantations, supplied\r\nits Colonies with what they needed from abroad, interdicted their\r\nmanufactures, and monopolized their trade. The prevalence of this system\r\nover the whole continent of America and the adjacent islands prevented all\r\nenterprize in the colonies, discouraged all improvement, and retarded\r\ntheir progress to independence.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution sundered these bonds only so far as they confined\r\nthirteen of the British Colonies, and left the remaining British\r\ndominions, and the continent, from Georgia around Cape Horn to the\r\nNorthern Ocean, under the same thraldom as before. Even the United States\r\nhad attained only physical independence. The moral influences of the\r\ncolonial system oppressed them still. Their trade, their laws, their\r\nscience, their literature, their social connections, their ecclesiastical\r\nrelations, their manners and their habits, were still colonial; and their\r\nthoughts continually clung around the ancient and majestic States of the\r\nEastern Continent.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution, so happily concluded here, broke out in France\r\nsimultaneously with the beginning of Washington's administration. The\r\nFrench nation passed in fifteen years from absolute despotism under Louis\r\nXVI., through all the phases of democracy to a military despotism under\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte; and retained through all these changes, only two\r\ncharacteristics--unceasing ferocity of faction, and increasing violence of\r\naggression against foreign States. The scandal of the French Revolution\r\nfell back upon the United States of America, who were regarded as the\r\nfirst disturbers of the ancient social system. The principal European\r\nmonarchs combined, under the guidance of England, to arrest the\r\npresumptuous career of France and extirpate democracy by the sword.\r\nNevertheless, the republican cause, however odious in Europe, was our\r\nnational cause. The sympathies of a large portion of the American people\r\ncould not be withdrawn from the French nation, which always claimed, even\r\nwhen marshalled into legions under the Corsican conqueror, to be fighting\r\nthe battles of freedom; while, on the other side, the citizens who\r\nregarded innovation as worse than tyranny, considered England and her\r\nallies as engaged in sustaining the cause of order, of government, and of\r\nsociety itself.\r\n\r\nThe line already drawn between the American people in regard to their\r\norganic law, naturally became the dividing line of the popular sympathies\r\nin the great European conflict. Thus deeply furrowed, that line became \"a\r\ngreat gulf fixed.\" The Federal party unconsciously became an English\r\nparty, although it indignantly disowned the epithet; and the Republican\r\nparty became a French party, although with equal sincerity it denied the\r\ngross impeachment. Each belligerent was thus encouraged to hope some aid\r\nfrom the United States, through the ever-expected triumph of its friends;\r\nwhile both conceived contemptuous opinions of a people who, from too eager\r\ninterest in a foreign fray, suffered their own national rights to be\r\ntrampled upon with impunity by the contending States.\r\n\r\nWashington set the new machine of government in motion. He formed his\r\ncabinet of recognized leaders of the adverse parties. Hamilton and Knox of\r\nthe Federal party were balanced by Jefferson and Randolph of the adverse\r\nparty. \"Washington took part with neither, but held the balance between\r\nthem with the scrupulous justice which marked his lofty nature.\" On the\r\n25th of April, 1793, he announced the neutrality of the United States\r\nbetween the belligerents, and his decision, without winning the respect of\r\neither, exasperated both. Each invaded our national rights more flagrantly\r\nthan before, and excused the injustice by the plea of necessary\r\nretaliation against its adversary, and each found willing apologists in a\r\nsympathizing faction in our own country.\r\n\r\nCommercial and political relations were to be established between the\r\nUnited States and the European Powers in this season of conflict.\r\nMinisters were needed who could maintain and vindicate abroad the same\r\nimpartiality practised by Washington at home. There was one citizen\r\neminently qualified for such a trust in such a conjuncture. Need I say\r\nthat citizen was the younger Adams, and that Washington had the sagacity\r\nto discover him?\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams successively completed missions at the Hague and at\r\nBerlin, in the period intervening between 1794 and 1801, with such\r\nadvantage and success, that in 1802 he was honored by his native\r\ncommonwealth with a seat as her representative in the Senate of the United\r\nStates. The insults offered to our country by the belligerents increased\r\nin aggravation as the contest between them became more violent and\r\nconvulsive. France, in 1804, laid aside even the name and forms of a\r\nRepublic, and the first consul, dropping the emblems of popular power,\r\nplaced the long-coveted diadem upon his brow, where its jewels sparkled\r\namong the laurels he had won in the conquest of Italy. Washington's\r\nadministration had passed away, leaving the American people in sullen\r\ndiscontent. John Adams had succeeded, and had atoned by the loss of power\r\nfor the offence he had given by causing a just but unavailing war to be\r\ndeclared against France. Jefferson was at the head of the Government; he\r\nthought the belligerents might be reduced to forbearance by depriving them\r\nof our commercial contributions of supplies, and recommended, first an\r\nembargo, and then non-intercourse. Britain was an insular and France a\r\ncontinental power. The effects of these measures would therefore be more\r\nsevere on the former than on the latter, and, unhappily, they were more\r\nsevere on our own country than on either of the offenders.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was the chief commercial State in the Union. She saw the\r\nruin of her commerce involved in the policy of Jefferson, and regarded it\r\nas an unworthy concession to the usurper of the French throne. In this\r\nemergency John Quincy Adams turned his back on Massachusetts, and threw\r\ninto the uprising scale of the administration, the weight of his talents\r\nand of his already eminent fame. Massachusetts instructed the recusant to\r\nrecant. He refused to obey, and resigned his place. His change of\r\npolitical relations astounded the country, and, with the customary charity\r\nof partisan zeal, was attributed to venality. It is now seen by us in the\r\nlight reflected upon it by the habitual independence, unquestioned purity,\r\nand lofty patriotism of his whole life; and thus seen, constitutes only\r\nthe first marked one of many instances wherein he broke the green withes\r\nwhich party fastened upon him, and maintained the cause of his country,\r\nreferring the care of his fame to God and to an impartial posterity. Like\r\nDecimus Brutus, whom Julius Caesar saluted among his executioners with\r\nthe exclamation \"Et tu, Brute!\" John Quincy Adams was not unfaithful, but\r\nhe could not be obliged where he was not left free.\r\n\r\nJefferson retired in 1809, leaving to his successor, the scholastic and\r\npeace-loving Madison, the perilous legacy of perplexed foreign relations,\r\nand embittered domestic feuds. Great Britain now filled the measure of\r\nexasperations, by insolently searching our vessels on the high seas, and\r\nimpressing into her marine all whom she chose to suspect of having been\r\nborn in her allegiance, even though they had renounced it and had assumed\r\nthe relations of American citizens. War was therefore imminent and\r\ninevitable. Russia was then coming forward to a position of commanding\r\ninfluence in Europe, and her youthful Emperor Alexander had won, by his\r\nchivalrous bearing, the respect of mankind. John Quincy Adams was wisely\r\nsent by the United States, to establish relations of amity with the great\r\npower of the North; and while he was thus engaged, the flames of European\r\nwar, which had been so long averted, involved his own country. War was\r\ndeclared against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt was just. It was necessary. Yet it was a war that dared Great Britain\r\nto re-assert her ancient sovereignty. It was a war with a power whose\r\nwealth and credit were practically inexhaustible, a power whose navy rode\r\nunchecked over all the seas, and whose impregnable garrisons encircled the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a power the war was waged by a nation that had not yet\r\naccumulated wealth, nor established credit, nor even opened avenues\r\nsuitable for transporting munitions of war through its extended\r\nterritories--that had only the germ of a navy, an inconsiderable army, and\r\nnot one substantial fortress. Yet such a war, under such circumstances,\r\nwas denounced as unnecessary and unjust, though for no better reason than\r\nbecause greater contumelies had been endured at the hands of France. Thus\r\na domestic feud, based on the very question of the war itself, enervated\r\nthe national strength, and encouraged the mighty adversary.\r\n\r\nThe desperate valor displayed at Chippewa and Lundy's Lane, at Fort Erie\r\nand Plattsburgh, and the brilliant victories won in contests between\r\nsingle ships of war on the ocean and armed fleets on the lakes, vindicated\r\nthe military prowess of the United States, but brought us no decisive\r\nadvantage. A suspension of the conflict in Europe followed Napoleon's\r\ndisastrous invasion of Russia, and left America alone opposed to her great\r\nadversary. Peace was necessary, because the national credit was\r\nexhausted--because the fortunes of the war were inclining against us--and\r\nbecause the opposition to it was ripening into disorganizing councils.\r\nAdams had prepared the way by securing the mediation of Alexander. Then,\r\nin that critical period, associated with Russell, Bayard, the learned and\r\nversatile Gallatin, and the eloquent and chivalric Clay, he negotiated\r\nwith firmness, with assiduity, with patience, and with consummate ability,\r\na definitive treaty of peace--a treaty of peace which, although it omitted\r\nthe causes of the war already obsolete, saved and established and\r\nconfirmed in its whole integrity the independence of the Republic--a\r\ntreaty of peace that yet endures, and, we willingly hope, may endure\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAfter fulfilling a subsequent mission at the Court of St. James, the\r\npacificator entered the domestic service of the country as Secretary of\r\nState in the administration of James Monroe; and at the expiration of that\r\nadministration became President of the United States. He attained the\r\nhonors of the Republic at the age of fifty-seven, in the forty-ninth year\r\nof independence. He was sixth in the succession, and with him closed the\r\nline of Chief Magistrates who had rendered to their country some tribute\r\nof their talents in civil or military service in the war of independence.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, on entering civil life, had found the Republic\r\nunstable. He retired in 1829, leaving it firmly established. It was thus\r\nhis happy fortune to preside at the completion of that work of\r\nconsolidation, the beginning of which was the end of the labors of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams engaged in this great work while yet in private life, in\r\n1793. He showed to his fellow-citizens, in a series of essays, the\r\ninability of the French people to maintain free institutions at that time,\r\nand the consequent necessity of American neutrality in the European war.\r\nThese publications aided Washington so much the more because they\r\nanticipated his own decision. Adams sustained the same great cause when he\r\nstrengthened the administration of Jefferson against the preponderating\r\ninfluence of Great Britain. His diplomatic services in Holland and Russia\r\nsecured, at a critical period, a favorable consideration in the Courts of\r\nthose countries, which conduced to the same end; and his brilliant success\r\nin restoring peace to the country so sorely pressed, relieved her from her\r\nenemies, reassured her, and gave to sceptical Europe conclusive proof\r\nthat her republican institutions were destined to endure.\r\n\r\nThe administration of John Quincy Adams blends so intimately with that of\r\nMonroe, in which he was chief Minister, that no dividing line can be drawn\r\nbetween them. Adams may be said, without derogation from the fame of\r\nMonroe, to have swayed the Government during his presidency; and with\r\nequal truth, Monroe may be admitted to have continued his administration\r\nthrough that of his successor.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of the Republic required that faction should be\r\nextinguished. Monroe began this difficult task cautiously, and pursued it\r\nwith good effect. John Quincy Adams completed the achievement. The dignity\r\nand moderation which marked his acceptance of the highest trust which a\r\nfree people could confer, beautifully foreshadowed the magnanimity with\r\nwhich it was to be discharged. He confessed himself deeply sensible of the\r\ncircumstances under which it had been conferred:--\r\n\r\nAll my predecessors (he said) have been honored with majorities of the\r\nelectoral voices, in the primary colleges. It has been my fortune to be\r\nplaced, by the divisions of sentiment prevailing among our countrymen, on\r\nthis occasion, in competition, friendly and honorable, with three of my\r\nfellow-citizens, all justly enjoying, in eminent degrees, the public\r\nfavor; and of whose worth, talents and services, no one entertains a\r\nhigher and more respectful sense than myself. The names of two of them\r\nwere, in the fulfilment of the provisions of the constitution, presented\r\nto the selection of the House of Representatives, in concurrence with my\r\nown, names closely associated with the glory of the nation, and one of\r\nthem farther recommended by a larger majority of the primary electoral\r\nsuffrages than mine. In this state of things, could my refusal to accept\r\nthe trust thus delegated to me give an opportunity to the people to form\r\nand to express, with a nearer approach to unanimity, the object of their\r\npreference, I should not hesitate to decline the acceptance of this\r\neminent charge, and to submit the decision of this momentous question\r\nagain to their determination.\r\n\r\nIt argued a noble consciousness of virtue to express, on such an occasion,\r\nso ingenuously, the emotions of a generous ambition.\r\n\r\nHe displayed the same great quality no less when he called to the post of\r\nchief Minister, in spite of clamors of corruption, Henry Clay, that one of\r\nhis late rivals who alone among his countrymen had the talents and\r\ngenerosity which the responsibilities of the period exacted.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams signalized his accession to the post of dangerous\r\nelevation by avowing the sentiments concerning parties by which he was\r\ninflexibly governed throughout his administration:--\r\n\r\nOf the two great political parties [he said] which have divided the\r\nopinions and feelings of our country, the candid and the just will now\r\nadmit, that both have contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity,\r\nardent patriotism, and disinterested sacrifices, to the formation and\r\nadministration of the Government, and that both have required a liberal\r\nindulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error. The revolutionary\r\nwars of Europe, commencing precisely at the moment when the Government of\r\nthe United States first went into operation under the constitution,\r\nexcited collisions of sentiments, and of sympathies, which kindled all the\r\npassions and embittered the conflict of parties, till the nation was\r\ninvolved in war, and the Union was shaken to its centre. This time of\r\ntrial embraced a period of five-and-twenty years, during which the policy\r\nof the Union in its relations with Europe constituted the principal basis\r\nof our own political divisions, and the most arduous part of action of the\r\nFederal Government. With the catastrophe in which the wars of the French\r\nRevolution terminated, and our own subsequent peace with Great Britain,\r\nthis baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From that time no\r\ndifference of principle, connected with the theory of government, or with\r\nour intercourse with foreign nations, has existed or been called forth in\r\nforce sufficient to sustain a continued combination of parties, or given\r\nmore than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate.\r\nOur political creed, without a dissenting voice that can be heard, is that\r\nthe will of the people is the source, and the happiness of the people is\r\nthe end, of all legitimate government upon earth--that the best security\r\nfor the beneficence, and the best guaranty against the abuse of power,\r\nconsists in the freedom, the purity, and the frequency of popular\r\nelections. That the General Government of the Union, and the separate\r\nGovernments of the States, are all sovereignties of legitimate powers;\r\nfellow servants of the same masters, uncontrolled within their respective\r\nspheres--uncontrollable by encroachments on each other. If there have been\r\nthose who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy was a\r\ngovernment competent to the wise and orderly management of the common\r\nconcerns of a mighty nation, those doubts have been dispelled. If there\r\nhave been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins\r\nof the Union, they have been scattered to the winds. If there have been\r\ndangerous attachments to one foreign nation, and antipathies against\r\nanother, they have been extinguished. Ten years of peace at home and\r\nabroad have assuaged the animosities of political contention and blended\r\ninto harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion. There still\r\nremains one effort of magnanimity, one sacrifice of prejudice and passion,\r\nto be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have heretofore\r\nfollowed the standards of political party. It is that of discarding every\r\nremnant of rancor against each other, of embracing, as countrymen and\r\nfriends, and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence\r\nwhich, in times of contention for principle, was bestowed only upon those\r\nwho bore the badge of party communion.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of John Quincy Adams, he was really the Chief\r\nMagistrate. He submitted neither his reason nor his conscience to the\r\ncontrol of any partisan cabal. No man was appointed to office in obedience\r\nto political dictation, and no faithful public servant was proscribed. The\r\nresult rewarded his magnanimity. Faction ceased to exist. When South\r\nCarolina, a few years afterward, assumed the very ground that the ancient\r\nrepublican party had indicated as lawful and constitutional, and claimed\r\nthe right and power to set aside, within her own limits, acts of Congress\r\nwhich she pronounced void, because they transcended the Federal authority,\r\nshe called on the republican party throughout the Union in vain. The\r\ndangerous heresy had been renounced forever. Since that time there has\r\nbeen no serious project of a combination to resist the laws of the Union,\r\nmuch less of a conspiracy to subvert the Union itself.\r\n\r\nWhat though the elements of political strife remain? They are necessary\r\nfor the life of free States. What though there still are parties, and the\r\ndin and turmoil of their contests are ceaselessly heard? They are founded\r\nnow on questions of mere administration, or on the more ephemeral\r\nquestions of personal merit. Such parties are dangerous only in the\r\ndecline, not in the vigor of Republics. Rome was no longer fit for\r\nfreedom, and needed a Dictator and a Sovereign, when Pompey and Caesar\r\ndivided the citizens. What though the magnanimity of Adams was not\r\nappreciated, and his contemporaries preferred his military competitor in\r\nthe subsequent election? The sword gathers none but ripe fruits, and the\r\nmasses of any people will sometimes prefer them to the long maturing\r\nharvest, which the statesmen of the living generations sow, to be reaped\r\nby their successors. For all this Adams cared not. He had extinguished the\r\nfactions which for forty years had endangered the State. He had left on\r\nthe records of history instructions and an example teaching how faction\r\ncould be overthrown, and his country might resort to them when danger\r\nshould recur. For himself he knew well, none knew better, that\r\n\r\n  \"He who ascends to mountain-tops shall find\r\n     The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow.\r\n   He who surpasses or subdues mankind,\r\n     Must look down on the hate of those below.\r\n   Though high above the sun of glory glow,\r\n     And far beneath the earth and ocean spread,\r\n   Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\r\n     Contending tempests on his naked head,\r\n  And thus reward the toils which to their summits led.\"\r\n\r\nThe federal authority had so long been factiously opposed, that the\r\npopular respect for its laws needed to be renewed. The State of Georgia\r\npresented the fit occasion. She insisted on expelling, forcibly, remnants\r\nof Indian tribes, within her limits, in virtue of a treaty which was\r\nimpeached for fraud, and came for revision before the Supreme Court and\r\nthe Senate. The President met the emergency with boldness and decision.\r\nThe demonstration thus given that good faith should be practised, and the\r\nlaw have its way, no matter how unequal the litigating parties, operated\r\nfavorably toward restoring the moral influence of the Government. That\r\ninfluence, although sometimes checked, has recently increased in strength,\r\nuntil the federal authority is universally regarded as final, and liberty\r\nagain walks confidently hand in hand with law.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams \"loved peace and ensued it.\" He loved peace as a\r\nChristian, because war was at enmity with the spirit and precepts of a\r\nreligion which he held to be divine. As a statesman and magistrate, he\r\nloved peace, because war was not merely injurious to national prosperity,\r\nbut because, whether successful or adverse, it was subversive of liberty.\r\nDemocracies are prone to war, and war consumes them. He favored,\r\ntherefore, all the philanthropic efforts of the age to cultivate the\r\nspirit of peace, and looked forward with benevolent hope to the ultimate\r\ninstitution of a General Congress of nations for the adjustment of their\r\ncontroversies. But he was no visionary and no enthusiast. He knew that as\r\nyet war was often inevitable--that pusillanimity provoked it, and that\r\nnational honor was national property of the highest value; because it was\r\nthe best national defence. He admitted only defensive war--but he did not\r\nnarrowly define it. He held that to be a defensive war, which was waged to\r\nsustain what could not be surrendered or relinquished without compromising\r\nthe independence, the just influence, or even the proper dignity of the\r\nState. Thus he had supported the war with Great Britain--thus in later\r\nyears he sustained President Jackson in his bold demonstration against\r\nFrance, when that power wantonly refused to perform the stipulations it\r\nhad made in a treaty of indemnity; and thus he yielded his support to what\r\nwas thought a warlike measure of the present administration in the\r\ndiplomatic controversy with Great Britain concerning the Territory of\r\nOregon. The living and the dead have mutual rights, and therefore it must\r\nbe added that he considered the present war with Mexico as unnecessary,\r\nunjust, and criminal. His opinion on this exciting question is among those\r\non which he referred himself to that future age which he so often\r\nconstituted the umpire between himself and his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nWith such principles on the subject of war, he regarded the establishment\r\nof a system of national defence as a necessary policy for consolidating\r\nthe Republic. He prosecuted, therefore, on a large scale, the work of\r\nfortification, and defended against popular opposition the institution for\r\nthe cultivation of military science, which has so recently vindicated that\r\nearly favor through the learning, valor, patriotism and humanity exhibited\r\nby its pupils on the fields of Mexico. But with that jealousy of the\r\nmilitary spirit which never forsakes the wise republican statesman, he\r\ncooperated in reducing the army to the lowest scale commensurate with its\r\nnecessary efficiency:\r\n\r\nIt was a vain and dangerous delusion (he said) to believe that in the\r\npresent or any probable condition of the world, a commerce so extensive as\r\nours could exist without the continual support of a military marine--the\r\nonly arm by which the power of a confederacy could be estimated or felt by\r\nforeign nations, and the only standing force which could never be\r\ndangerous to our own liberties.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of our navy, under the influence of these opinions, is\r\namong the measures of national consolidation we owe to him; and the\r\ninstitution for naval education we enjoy, is a recent result of his early\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nBut John Quincy Adams relied for national security and peace mainly on an\r\nenlightened and broad system of civil policy. He looked through the future\r\ncombinations of States, and studied the accidents to which they were\r\nexposed, that he might seasonably remove causes of future conflict. His\r\ngenius, when exercised in this lofty duty, played in its native element.\r\nHe had cordially approved the measures by which Washington had secured the\r\nfree navigation of the Mississippi. He approved the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana, although with Jefferson he insisted on a preliminary amendment\r\nof the constitution for that purpose. He had no narrow bigotry, concerning\r\nthe soil to which the institutions of our fathers should be confined, and\r\nno local prejudice against their extension in any direction required by\r\nthe public security, if the extension should be made with justice, honor,\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Louisiana had only given us additional territory,\r\nfruitful in new commerce, to be exposed to dangers which remain to be\r\novercome. Spain still possessed, beside the Island of Cuba, the Peninsula\r\nof the Floridas, and thus held the keys of the Mississippi. The real\r\nindependence, the commercial and the moral independence, of the United\r\nStates, remained to be effected at the close of the European wars, and of\r\nour own war with England. Our political independence had been confirmed,\r\nand that was all. John Quincy Adams addressed himself, as Secretary of\r\nState, to the subversion of what remained of the colonial system. He\r\ncommenced by an auspicious purchase of the Floridas, which gave us\r\nimportant maritime advantages on the Gulf of Mexico, while it continued\r\nour Atlantic sea-board unbroken from the Bay of Fundy to the Sabine.\r\n\r\nThe ever-advancing American Revolution was at the same time opening the\r\nway to complete disinthralment. The Spanish-American Provinces revolted,\r\nand seven new Republics, with constitutions not widely differing from our\r\nown--Buenos Ayres, Guatamala, Colombia, Mexico, Chili, Central America,\r\nand Peru--suddenly claimed audience and admission among the nations of the\r\nearth. The people of those countries were but doubtfully prepared to\r\nmaintain their contest for independence, or to support republican\r\ninstitutions. But on the other side Spain was enervated and declining. She\r\napplied to the Holy League of Europe for their aid, and the new Republics\r\napplied to the United States for that recognition which could not fail to\r\nimpart strength. The question was momentous. The ancient colonial system\r\nwas at stake. All Europe was interested in maintaining it. The Holy League\r\nheld Europe fast bound to the rock of despotism, and were at liberty to\r\nengage the United States in a war for the subversion of their\r\nindependence, if they should dare to extend their aid or protection to the\r\nrebellious Colonies in South America.\r\n\r\nSuch a war would be a war of the two continents--an universal war. Who\r\ncould foretell its termination, or its dread results? But the emancipation\r\nof Spanish America was necessary for our own larger freedom, and our own\r\ncomplete security. That freedom and that security required that the\r\nnations of Europe should relax their grasp on the American Continent. The\r\nquestion was long and anxiously debated. The American people hesitated to\r\nhazard, for speculative advantages, the measures of independence already\r\nobtained. Monroe and Adams waited calmly and firmly. The impassioned voice\r\nof Henry Clay rose from the Chamber of Representatives. It rang through\r\nthe continent like the notes of the clarion, inspiring South America with\r\nnew resolution, and North America with the confidence the critical\r\noccasion demanded.  That noble appeal was answered. South America stood\r\nfirm, and North America was ready. Then it was that John Quincy Adams,\r\nwith those generous impulses which the impatient blood of his\r\nrevolutionary sire always prompted, and with that enlightened sagacity\r\nwhich never misapprehended the interests of his country, nor mistook the\r\ntime nor the means to secure them, obtained from the administration and\r\nfrom Congress the acknowledgment of the independence of the young American\r\nnations. To give decisive effect to this great measure, Monroe, in 1823,\r\nsolemnly declared to the world, that thenceforth any attempt by any\r\nforeign power to establish the colonial system in any part of this\r\ncontinent, already emancipated, would be resisted as an aggression against\r\nthe independence of the United States. On the accession of Adams to the\r\nadministration of the Government, the vast American continental\r\npossessions of Brazil separated themselves from the crown of Portugal and\r\nbecame an independent State. Adams improved these propitious and sublime\r\nevents by negotiating treaties of reciprocal trade with the youthful\r\nnations; and, concurring with Monroe, accepted, in behalf of the United\r\nStates, their invitation to a General Congress of American States to be\r\nheld at Panama, to cement relations of amity among themselves, and to\r\nconsider, if it should become necessary, the proper means to repel the\r\napprehended interference of the Holy League of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe last measure transcended the confidence of a large and respectable\r\nportion of the American people. But its moral effect was needed to secure\r\nthe stability of the South American Republics. Adams persevered, and, in\r\ndefending his course, gave notice to the powers of Europe, by this bold\r\ndeclaration, that the determination of the United States was inflexible:--\r\n\r\n\"If it be asked, whether this meeting, and the principles which may be\r\nadjusted and settled by it, as rules of intercourse between American\r\nnations, may not give umbrage to European powers, or offence to Spain, it\r\nis deemed a sufficient answer, that our attendance at Panama can give no\r\njust cause of umbrage or offence to either, and that the United States\r\nwill stipulate nothing there, which can give such cause. Here the right of\r\ninquiry into our purposes and measures must stop. The Holy League of\r\nEurope, itself, was formed without inquiring of the United States, whether\r\nit would or would not give umbrage to them. The fear of giving umbrage to\r\nthe Holy League of Europe was urged as a motive for denying to the\r\nAmerican nations the acknowledgment of their independence. The Congress\r\nand the administration of that day consulted their rights and their\r\nduties, not their fears. The United States must still, as heretofore, take\r\ncounsel from their duties, rather than their fears.\"\r\n\r\nContrast, fellow-citizens, this declaration of John Quincy Adams,\r\nPresident of the United States in 1825, with the proclamation of\r\nneutrality, between the belligerents of Europe, made by Washington in\r\n1793, with the querrulous complaints of your Ministers against the French\r\nDirectory and the British Ministry at the close of the last century, and\r\nwith the acts of embargo and non-intercourse at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, destroying our own commerce to conquer forbearance from\r\nthe intolerant European powers. Learn from this contrast, the epoch of the\r\nconsolidation of the Republic. Thus instructed, do honor to the statesman\r\nand magistrate by whom, not forgetting the meed due to his illustrious\r\ncompeers, the colonial system was overthrown throughout Spanish America,\r\nand the independence of the United States was completely and finally\r\nconsummated.\r\n\r\nThe intrepid and unwearied statesman now directed his attention to the\r\nremnants of the colonial system still preserved in the Canadas and West\r\nIndies. Great Britain, by parliamentary measures, had undermined our\r\nmanufactures, and, receiving only our raw materials, repaid us with\r\nfabrics manufactured from them, while she excluded us altogether from the\r\ncarrying trade with her colonial possessions. John Quincy Adams sought to\r\ncounteract this injurious legislation, by a revenue system, which should\r\nrestore the manufacturing industry of the country, while he offered\r\nreciprocal trade as a compromise. His administration ended during a\r\nbeneficial trial of this vigorous policy. But it taxed too severely the\r\npatriotism of some of the States, and was relinquished by his successors.\r\n\r\nIndolence begets degeneracy, and immobility is the first stage of\r\ndissolution. John Quincy Adams sought not merely to consolidate the\r\nRepublic, but to perpetuate it. For this purpose he bent vast efforts,\r\nwith success, to such a policy of internal improvement as would increase\r\nthe facilities of communication and intercourse between the States, and\r\nbring into being that great internal trade which must ever constitute the\r\nstrongest bond of federal union. Wherever a lighthouse has been erected,\r\non our sea-coast, on our lakes, or on our rivers--wherever a mole or pier\r\nhas been constructed or begun--wherever a channel obstructed by shoals or\r\nsawyers has been opened, or begun to be opened--wherever a canal or\r\nrailroad, adapted to national uses, has been made or projected--there the\r\nengineers of the United States, during the administration of John Quincy\r\nAdams, made explorations, and opened the way for a diligent prosecution of\r\nhis designs by his successors. This policy, apparently so stupendous, was\r\nconnected with a system of fiscal economy so rigorous, that the treasury\r\naugmented its stores, while the work of improvement went on; the public\r\ndebt, contracted in past wars, dissolved away, and the nation flourished\r\nin unexampled prosperity. John Quincy Adams administered the Federal\r\nGovernment, while De Witt Clinton was presiding in the State of New York.\r\nIt is refreshing to recall the noble emulation of these illustrious\r\nbenefactors--an emulation that shows how inseparable sound philosophy is\r\nfrom true patriotism.\r\n\r\nIf [said Adams, in his first annual message to the Congress of the United\r\nStates,] the powers enumerated may be effectually brought into action by\r\nlaws promoting the improvement of agriculture, commerce and manufactures,\r\nthe cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic arts, and of the elegant\r\narts, the advancement of literature, and the progress of the sciences,\r\nornamental and profound, to refrain from exercising them for the benefit\r\nof the people would be to hide in the earth the talent committed to our\r\ncharge, would be treachery to the most sacred of trusts. The spirit of\r\nimprovement is abroad upon the earth. It stimulates the hearts, and\r\nsharpens the faculties, not of our fellow-citizens alone, but of the\r\nnations of Europe, and of their rulers. While dwelling with pleasing\r\nsatisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political institutions,\r\nlet us not be unmindful that liberty is power, that the nation blessed\r\nwith the largest portion of liberty, must in proportion to its numbers be\r\nthe most powerful nation upon earth, and that the tenure of power by man\r\nis, in the moral purposes of his Creator, upon condition that it shall be\r\nexercised to ends of beneficence, to improve the condition of himself, and\r\nhis fellow men. While foreign nations, less blessed with that freedom\r\nwhich is power than ourselves, are advancing with gigantic strides in the\r\ncareer of public improvement, were we to slumber in indolence, or fold our\r\narms and proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our\r\nconstituents, would it not be to cast away the bounties of Providence and\r\ndoom ourselves to perpetual inferiority? In the course of the year now\r\ndrawing to its close, we have beheld, under the auspices, and at the\r\nexpense of one State of this Union, a new university unfolding its portals\r\nto the sons of science, and holding up the torch of human improvement to\r\neyes that seek the light.[Footnote: The University of Virginia.] We have\r\nseen, under the persevering and enlightened enterprise of another State,\r\nthe waters of our Western lakes mingle with those of the ocean. If\r\nundertakings like these have been accomplished in the compass of a few\r\nyears, by the authority of single members of our confederacy, can we, the\r\nrepresentative authorities of the whole Union, fall behind our fellow\r\nservants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for the benefit of\r\nour common sovereign, by the accomplishment of works important to the\r\nwhole and to which neither the authority nor the resources of anyone State\r\ncan be adequate?\r\n\r\nThe disastrous career of many of the States, and the absolute inaction of\r\nothers, since the responsibilities of internal improvement have been cast\r\noff by the federal authorities, and developed upon the States, without\r\nother sources of revenue than direct taxation, and with no other motives\r\nto stimulate them than their own local interests, are a fitting commentary\r\non the error of that departure from the policy of John Quincy Adams. If\r\nother comment were necessary, it would be found in the fact that States\r\nhave revised and amended their constitutions, so as to abridge the power\r\nof their Legislatures to prosecute the beneficent enterprises which the\r\nFederal Government has devolved upon them. The Smithsonian Institute, at\r\nthe seat of Government, founded by the liberality of a cosmopolite, is\r\nthat same university so earnestly recommended by Adams for the increase\r\nand diffusion of knowledge among men. The exploration of the globe, for\r\npurposes of geographical and political knowledge, which has so recently\r\nbeen made under the authority of the Union, and with such noble results,\r\nwas an enterprize conceived and suggested by the same statesman. The\r\nNational Observatory at the capital, which is piercing the regions nearest\r\nto the throne of the eternal Author of the universe, is an emanation of\r\nthe same comprehensive wisdom.\r\n\r\nSuch was the administration of John Quincy Adams. Surely it exhibits\r\nenough done for duty and for fame--if the ancient philosopher said truly,\r\nthat the duty of a statesman was to make the citizens happy, to make them\r\nfirm in power, rich in wealth, splendid in glory, and eminent in virtue,\r\nand that such achievements were the greatest and best of all works among\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBut the measure of duty was not yet fulfilled. The Republic thought it no\r\nlonger had need of the services of Adams, and he bowed to its command. Two\r\nyears elapsed, and lo! the priest was seen again beside the deserted\r\naltar, and a brighter, purer, and more lasting flame arose out of the\r\nextinguished embers.\r\n\r\n  \"He looked in years. But in his years were seen\r\n   A youthful vigor, an autumnal green.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republic had been extended and consolidated; but human slavery, which\r\nhad been incorporated in it, was extended and consolidated also, and was\r\nspreading, so as to impair the strength of the great fabric on which the\r\nhopes of the nations were suspended. Slavery therefore must be restrained,\r\nand, without violence or injustice, must be abolished. The difficult task\r\nof removing it had been postponed by the statesmen of the Revolution, and\r\nhad been delayed and forgotten by their successors. There were now\r\nresolute hearts and willing hands to undertake it, but who was strong\r\nenough, and bold enough to lead? Who had patience to bear with enthusiasm\r\nthat overleaped its mark, and with intolerance that defeated its own\r\ngenerous purposes? Slaveholders had power, nay, the national power; and\r\nstrange to say, they had it with the nation's consent and sympathy. Who\r\nwas bold enough to provoke them, and bring the execration of the nation\r\ndown upon his own head? Who would do this, when even abolitionists\r\nthemselves, rendered implacable by the manifestation of those sentiments\r\nof justice and moderation, without which the most humane cause, depending\r\non a change of public opinion, cannot be conducted safely to a prosperous\r\nend, were ready to betray their own champion into the hands of the\r\navenger? That leader was found in the person of John Quincy Adams. He took\r\nhis seat in the House of Representatives in 1831, without assumption or\r\nostentation. Abolitionists placed in his hand petitions for the\r\nsuppression of slavery in the District of Columbia, the seat of the\r\nfederal authorities. He offered them to the House of Representatives, and\r\nthey were rejected with contumely and scorn. Suddenly the alarm went\r\nforth, that the aged and venerable servant was retaliating upon his\r\ncountry by instigating a servile war, that such a war must be avoided,\r\neyen at the cost of sacrificing the freedom of petition and the freedom of\r\ndebate, and that if the free States would not consent to make that\r\nsacrifice, then the Union should be dissolved. This alarm had its desired\r\neffect. The House of Representatives, in 1837, adopted a rule of\r\ndiscipline, equivalent to an act, ordaining that no petition relating to\r\nslavery, nearly or remotely, should be read, debated or considered. The\r\nSenate adopted a like edict. The State authorities approved. Slavery was\r\nnot less strongly entrenched behind the bulwark of precedents in the\r\ncourts of law than in the fixed habits of thought and action among the\r\npeople. The people even in the free States denounced the discussion of\r\nslavery, and suppressed it by unlawful force. John Quincy Adams stood\r\nunmoved amid the storm. He knew that the only danger incident to political\r\nreform, was the danger of delaying it too long. The French Revolution had\r\nmade this an axiom of political science. If, indeed, the discussion of\r\nslavery was so hazardous as was pretended, it had been deferred too long\r\nalready. The advocates of slavery had committed a fatal error. They had\r\nabolished freedom of speech and freedom of petition to save an obnoxious\r\ninstitution. As soon as the panic should subside, the people would demand\r\nthe restoration of those precious rights, and would scrutinize with\r\nfearless fidelity the cause for which they had been suppressed. He offered\r\npetition after petition, each bolder and more importunate than the last.\r\nHe debated questions, kindred to those which were forbidden, with the\r\nfirmness and fervor of his noble nature. For age\r\n\r\n  Had not quenched the open truth\r\n  And fiery vehemence of youth.\r\n\r\nSoon he gained upon his adversaries. District after district sent\r\nchampions to his side. States reconsidered, and resolved in his behalf. He\r\nsaw the tide was turning, and then struck one bold blow, not now for\r\nfreedom of petition and debate, but a stroke of bold and retaliating\r\nwarfare. He offered a resolution declaring that the following amendments\r\nof the constitution of the United States be submitted to the people of the\r\nseveral States for their adoption:\r\n\r\nFrom and after the fourth day of July, 1842, there shall be, throughout\r\nthe United States, NO HEREDITARY SLAVERY, but on and after that day every\r\nchild born within the United States shall be FREE.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Territory of Florida, there shall, henceforth,\r\nnever be admitted into this Union, any STATE the constitution of which\r\nshall tolerate within the same the existence of SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the obnoxious rule of the House of Representatives was rescinded.\r\nThe freedom of debate and petition was restored, and the unrestrained and\r\nirrepressible discussion of slavery by the press and political parties\r\nbegan. For the rest, the work of emancipation abides the action, whether\r\nit be slow or fast, of the moral sense of the American people. It depends\r\nnot on the zeal and firmness only of the reformers, but on their wisdom\r\nand moderation also. Stoicism, that had no charity for error, never\r\nconverted any human society to virtue; Christianity, that remembers the\r\ntrue nature of man, has encompassed a large portion of the globe. How long\r\nemancipation may be delayed, is among the things concealed from our\r\nknowledge, but not so the certain result. The perils of the enterprize\r\nare already passed--its difficulties have already been removed--when it\r\nshall have been accomplished it will be justly regarded as the last noble\r\neffort which rendered the Republic imperishable.\r\n\r\nThen the merit of the great achievement will be awarded to John Quincy\r\nAdams; and by none more gratefully than by the communities on whom the\r\ninstitution of slavery has brought the calamity of premature and\r\nconsumptive decline, in the midst of free, vigorous, and expanding States.\r\n\r\nIf this great transaction could be surpassed in dramatic sublimity, it was\r\nsurpassed when the same impassioned advocate of humanity appeared, at the\r\nage of seventy-four, with all the glorious associations that now clustered\r\nupon him, at the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, and\r\npleaded, without solicitation or reward, the cause of Cinque and thirty\r\nother Africans, who had been stolen by a Spanish slaver from their native\r\ncoast, had slain the master and crew of the pirate vessel, floated into\r\nthe waters of the United States, and there been claimed by the President,\r\nin behalf of the authorities of Spain. He pleaded this great cause with\r\nsuch happy effect, that the captives were set at liberty. Conveyed by the\r\ncharity of the humane to their native shores, they bore the pleasing\r\nintelligence to Africa, that justice was at last claiming its way among\r\ncivilized and Christian men!\r\n\r\nThe recital of heroic actions loses its chief value, if we cannot discover\r\nthe principles in which they were born. The text of John Quincy Adams,\r\nfrom which he deduced the duties of citizens, and of the republic, was the\r\naddress of the Continental Congress to the people of the United States, on\r\nthe occasion of the successful close of the American Revolution. He dwelt\r\noften and emphatically on the words:\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered, that it has ever been the pride and the boast of\r\nAmerica, that the rights for which she contended were the rights of human\r\nnature. By the blessing of the Author of those rights, they have prevailed\r\nover all opposition, and form the basis of thirteen independent States. No\r\ninstance has heretofore occurred, nor can any instance be expected\r\nhereafter to occur, in which the unadulterated forms of republican\r\ngovernment can pretend to so fair an opportunity of justifying themselves\r\nby their fruits. In this view, the citizens of the United States are\r\nresponsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a political society.\r\nIf JUSTICE, GOOD FAITH, HONOR, GRATITUDE, and all the other qualities\r\nwhich ennoble the character of a nation and fulfil the ends of government,\r\nbe the fruits of our establishments, the cause of liberty will acquire a\r\ndignity and lustre which it has never yet enjoyed, and an example will be\r\nset which cannot but have the most favorable influence on mankind. If, on\r\nthe other side, our Governments should be unfortunately blotted with the\r\nreverse of these cardinal virtues, the great cause which we have engaged\r\nto vindicate will be dishonored and betrayed; the last and fairest\r\nexperiment in favor of the rights of human nature will be turned against\r\nthem, and their patrons and friends exposed to the insults, and silenced\r\nby the votaries of tyranny and usurpation.\r\n\r\nSenators and Representatives of the People of the State of New York: I had\r\nturned my steps away from your honored halls, long since, as I thought\r\nforever. I come back to them by your command, to fulfil a higher duty and\r\nmore honorable service than ever before devolved upon me. I repay your\r\ngenerous confidence, by offering to you this exposition of the duties of\r\nthe magistrate and of the citizen. It is the same which John Quincy Adams\r\ngave to the Congress of the United States, in his oration on the death of\r\nJames Madison. It is the key to his own exalted character, and it enables\r\nus to measure the benefits he conferred upon his country. If then you ask\r\nwhat motive enabled him to rise above parties, sects, combinations,\r\nprejudices, passions, and seductions, I answer that he served his country,\r\nnot alone, or chiefly because that country was his own, but because he\r\nknew her duties and her destiny, and knew her cause was the cause of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIf you inquire why he was so rigorous in virtue as to be often thought\r\naustere, I answer it was because human nature required the exercise of\r\njustice, honor, and gratitude, by all who were clothed with authority to\r\nact in the name of the American people. If you ask why he seemed,\r\nsometimes, with apparent inconsistency, to lend his charities to the\r\ndistant and the future rather than to his own kindred and times, I reply,\r\nit was because he held that the tenure of human power is on condition of\r\nits being beneficently exercised for the common welfare of the human race.\r\nSuch men are of no country. They belong to mankind. If we cannot rise to\r\nthis height of virtue, we cannot hope to comprehend the character of John\r\nQuincy Adams, or understand the homage paid by the American people to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nNeed it be said that John Quincy Adams studied justice, honor and\r\ngratitude, not by the false standards of the age, but by their own true\r\nnature?  He generalized truth, and traced it always to its source, the\r\nbosom of God. Thus in his defence of the Amistad captives he began with\r\ndefining justice in the language of Justinian, \"Constans et perpetua\r\nvoluntas jus SUUM cuique tribuendi.\" He quoted on the same occasion from\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, not by way of rhetorical embellishment,\r\nand not even as a valid human ordinance, but as a truth of nature, of\r\nuniversal application, the memorable words, \"We hold these truths to be\r\nself-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by\r\ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these rights\r\nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" In his vindication of\r\nthe right of debate, he declared that the principle that religious\r\nopinions were altogether beyond the sphere of legislative control, was but\r\none modification of a more extensive axiom, which included the unbounded\r\nfreedom of the press, and of speech, and of the communication of thought\r\nin all its forms. He rested the inviolability of the right of petition,\r\nnot on constitutions, or charters, which might be glossed, abrogated or\r\nexpunged, but in the inherent right of every animate creature to pray to\r\nits superior.\r\n\r\nThe model by which he formed his character was Cicero. Not the living\r\nCicero, sometimes inconsistent; often irresolute; too often seeming to act\r\na studied part; and always covetous of applause. But Cicero, as he aimed\r\nto be, and as he appears revealed in those immortal emanations of his\r\ngenius which have been the delight and guide of intellect and virtue in\r\nevery succeeding age. Like the Roman, Adams was an orator, but he did not\r\nfall into the error of the Roman, in practically valuing eloquence more\r\nthan the beneficence to which it should be devoted. Like him he was a\r\nstatesman and magistrate worthy to be called \"The second founder of the\r\nRepublic,\"--like him a teacher of didactic philosophy, of morals, and even\r\nof his own peculiar art; and like him he made all liberal learning\r\ntributary to that noble art, while poetry was the inseparable companion of\r\nhis genius in its hours of relaxation from the labors of the forum and of\r\nthe capitol.\r\n\r\nLike him he loved only the society of good men, and by his generous praise\r\nof such, illustrated the Roman's beautiful aphorism, that no one can be\r\nenvious of good deeds, who has confidence in his own virtue. Like Cicero\r\nhe kept himself unstained by social or domestic vices; preserved serenity\r\nand cheerfulness; cherished habitual reverence for the Deity, and dwelt\r\ncontinually, not on the mystic theology of the schools, but on the hopes\r\nof a better life. He lived in what will be regarded as the virtuous age of\r\nhis country, while Cicero was surrounded by an overwhelming degeneracy. He\r\nhad the light of Christianity for his guide; and its sublime motives as\r\nincitements to virtue: while Cicero had only the confused instructions of\r\nthe Grecian schools, and saw nothing certainly attainable but present\r\napplause and future fame. In moral courage, therefore, he excelled his\r\nmodel and rivalled Cato. But Cato was a visionary, who insisted upon\r\nhis right to act always without reference to the condition of mankind, as\r\nhe should have acted in Plato's imaginary Republic. Adams stood in this\r\nrespect midway between the impracticable stoic and the too flexible\r\nacademician. He had no occasion to say, as the Grecian orator did, that if\r\nhe had sometimes acted contrary to himself, he had never acted contrary to\r\nthe Republic; but he might justly have said, as the noble Roman did, \"I\r\nhave rendered to my country all the great services which she was willing\r\nto receive at my hands, and I have never harbored a thought concerning her\r\nthat was not divine.\"\r\n\r\nMore fortunate than Cicero, who fell a victim of civil wars which he could\r\nnot avert, Adams was permitted to linger on the earth, until the\r\ngenerations of that future age, for whom he had lived and to whom he had\r\nappealed from the condemnation of contemporaries, came up before the\r\ncurtain which had shut out his sight, and pronounced over him, as he was\r\nsinking into the grave, their judgment of approval and benediction.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished characteristics of his life were BENEFICENT LABOR and\r\nPERSONAL CONTENTMENT. He never sought wealth, but devoted himself to the\r\nservice of mankind. Yet, by the practice of frugality and method, he\r\nsecured the enjoyment of dealing forth continually no stinted charities,\r\nand died in affluence. He never solicited place or preferment, and had no\r\npartizan combinations or even connections; yet he received honors which\r\neluded the covetous grasp of those who formed parties, rewarded friends\r\nand proscribed enemies; and he filled a longer period of varied and\r\ndistinguished service than ever fell to the lot of any other citizen. In\r\nevery stage of this progress he was CONTENT. He was content to be\r\npresident, minister, representative, or citizen.\r\n\r\nStricken in the midst of this service, in the very act of rising to\r\ndebate, he fell into the arms of conscript fathers of the Republic. A long\r\nlethargy supervened and oppressed his senses. Nature rallied the wasting\r\npowers, on the verge of the grave, for a very brief period. But it was\r\nlong enough for him. The rekindled eye showed that the re-collected mind\r\nwas clear, calm, and vigorous. His weeping family, and his sorrowing\r\ncompeers were there. He surveyed the scene and knew at once its fatal\r\nimport. He had left no duty unperformed; he had no wish unsatisfied; no\r\nambition unattained; no regret, no sorrow, no fear, no remorse. He could\r\nnot shake off the dews of death that gathered on his brow. He could not\r\npierce the thick shades that rose up before him. But he knew that eternity\r\nlay close by the shores of time. He knew that his Redeemer lived.\r\nEloquence, even in that hour, inspired him with his ancient sublimity of\r\nutterance. \"THIS,\" said the dying man. \"THIS IS THE END OF EARTH.\" He\r\npaused for a moment, and then added, \"I AM CONTENT.\" Angels might well\r\ndraw aside the curtains of the skies to look down on such a scene--a scene\r\nthat approximated even to that scene of unapproachable sublimity, not to\r\nbe recalled without reverence, when, in mortal agony, ONE who spake as\r\nnever man spake, said, \"IT IS FINISHED!\"\r\n\r\nOnly two years after the birth of John Quincy Adams, there appeared on an\r\nisland in the Mediterranean sea, a human spirit newly born, endowed with\r\nequal genius, without the regulating qualities of justice and benevolence\r\nwhich Adams possessed in an eminent degree. A like career opened to\r\nboth--born like Adams, a subject of a king--the child of more genial\r\nskies, like him, became in early life a patriot and a citizen of a new and\r\ngreat Republic. Like Adams he lent his service to the State in precocious\r\nyouth, and in its hour of need, and won its confidence. But unlike Adams\r\nhe could not wait the dull delays of slow and laborious, but sure\r\nadvancement. He sought power by the hasty road that leads through fields\r\nof carnage, and he became, like Adams, a supreme magistrate, a Consul. But\r\nthere were other Consuls. He was not content. He thrust them aside, and\r\nwas Consul alone. Consular power was too short. He fought new battles, and\r\nwas Consul for life. But power, confessedly derived from the people, must\r\nbe exercised in obedience to their will, and must be resigned to them\r\nagain, at least in death. He was not content. He desolated Europe afresh,\r\nsubverted the Republic, imprisoned the patriarch who presided over Rome's\r\ncomprehensive See, and obliged him to pour on his head the sacred oil that\r\nmade the persons of kings divine, and their right to reign indefeasible.\r\nHe was an Emperor. But he saw around him a mother, brothers and sisters,\r\nnot ennobled; whose humble state reminded him, and the world, that he was\r\nborn a plebeian; and he had no heir to wait impatient for the imperial\r\ncrown. He scourged the earth again, and again fortune smiled on him even\r\nin his wild extravagance. He bestowed kingdoms and principalities upon his\r\nkindred--put away the devoted wife of his youthful days, and another, a\r\ndaughter of Hapsburgh's imperial house, joyfully accepted his proud\r\nalliance. Offspring gladdened his anxious sight; a diadem was placed on\r\nits infant brow, and it received the homage of princes, even in its\r\ncradle. Now he was indeed a monarch--a legitimate monarch--a monarch by\r\ndivine appointment--the first of an endless succession of monarchs. But\r\nthere were other monarchs who held sway in the earth. He was not content.\r\nHe would reign with his kindred alone. He gathered new and greater\r\narmies--from his own land--from subjugated lands. He called forth the\r\nyoung and brave--one from every household--from the Pyrenees to Zuyder\r\nZee--from Jura to the ocean. He marshalled them into long and majestic\r\ncolumns, and went forth to seize that universal dominion, which seemed\r\nalmost within his grasp. But ambition had tempted fortune too far. The\r\nnations of the earth resisted, repelled, pursued, surrounded him. The\r\npageant was ended. The crown fell from his presumptuous head.  The wife\r\nwho had wedded him in his pride, forsook him when the hour of fear came\r\nupon him. His child was ravished from his sight. His kinsmen were degraded\r\nto their first estate, and he was no longer Emperor, nor Consul, nor\r\nGeneral, nor even a citizen, but an exile and a prisoner, on a lonely\r\nisland, in the midst of the wild Atlantic. Discontent attended him there.\r\nThe wayward man fretted out a few long years of his yet unbroken manhood,\r\nlooking off at the earliest dawn and in evening's latest twilight, towards\r\nthat distant world that had only just eluded his grasp. His heart\r\ncorroded. Death came, not unlooked for, though it came even then\r\nunwelcome. He was stretched on his bed within the fort which constituted\r\nhis prison. A few fast and faithful friends stood around, with the guards\r\nwho rejoiced that the hour of relief from long and wearisome watching was\r\nat hand. As his strength wasted away, delirium stirred up the brain from\r\nits long and inglorious inactivity. The pageant of ambition returned. He\r\nwas again a Lieutenant, a General, a Consul, an Emperor of France. He\r\nfilled again the throne of Charlemagne. His kindred pressed around him\r\nagain, re-invested with the pompous pageantry of royalty. The daughter of\r\nthe long line of kings again stood proudly by his side, and the sunny face\r\nof his child shone out from beneath the diadem that encircled its flowing\r\nlocks. The marshals of the Empire awaited his command. The legions of the\r\nold guard were in the field, their scarred faces rejuvenated, and their\r\nranks, thinned in many battles, replenished, Russia, Prussia, Austria,\r\nDenmark and England, gathered their mighty hosts to give him battle. Once\r\nmore he mounted his impatient charger, and rushed forth to conquest. He\r\nwaved his sword aloft, and cried \"TETE D'ARMEE.\" The feverish vision\r\nbroke--the mockery was ended. The silver cord was loosed, and the warrior\r\nfell back upon his bed a lifeless corpse. THIS WAS THE END OF EARTH. THE\r\nCORSICAN WAS NOT CONTENT.\r\n\r\nSTATESMEN AND CITIZENS! the contrast suggests its own impressive moral.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
